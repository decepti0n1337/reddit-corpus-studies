There has been nothing stopping assholes from going to those events either. Level 10 legendary weapons scrip just as well as level 50s. And with the daily Kill a Legendary challenges, plenty of high level people are going to the LoP events.  If you're that worried about having an event all to yourself, buy 1st.

I get home in about 3 and a half hours from right now. Thats usually when i play. If you see me on (Fat_Boys_Brunch) send me a message. Ive been a lone wanderer but im branching out.
---
&gt;because I’m clearly in the minority here regarding the BoS. :)
---

---
Not in the slightest, fake fantasy knights can take a hike.
---
Addictions are in categories, not to specific chems. You probably already have an addiction from a chem in the same class as buffout.
---
I don't have that collectron I'm afraid, I just shamelessly check to see if everyone else has theirs unlocked or not. My collection of propaganda fliers is ever growing.
---
Overweight and can't move I to am stuck in the Appalachia
---
The one on pc is called Survival Options, I just checked, but it runs through F4SE so there probably isn't a console version, sorry. Might be worth searching for it though on bethnet anyway.
---
You've contracted weeping sores
---
I'm sick of the BoS, they are awful in every game and for some reason everything revolves around them every single time.
---
&gt;This is a solution to the problem of excess cards.
---
Excess cards is not a problem. It doesn't need a solution.   It does not interfere with your game play in any way.
---
If it's a problem at all, then it's a problem that shouldn't even be in the game. At all.   It's in the game because of  Bethesda's poor game design choices.
---
Dumping you into a tedious grind for several hundred more levels is a solution in search of a problem that does not exist.
---
Yeah compared to other weapons I feel the shotguns are op
---
Why is scrapping cards even a thing, especially when we're missing a lot of them that were auto deleted for being dupes? I don't really understand why they're doing it that way to begin with.
---
My alt character is stuck on that big too. Funnily enough they actually shortened that mission and now with the bug it's never ending lol
---
I am going to comment on the wallpapers. Not sure if it's intended, but it looks like you can apply un-owned wallpapers while they are up in the atom shop. When they leave the shop, you won't be able to apply them to new walls, but the ones already papered will stay. Again, not sure if that is WAI, just what I also observed.
---
what about the instanced interiors.. why cant I kill everyone in there?
---
no good reason I can think of
---
Remember that there will be 2x challenges weekends probably due to the brotherhood of steel event. You might be able to catch up more than you think, if that is not represented in the akarnokd tool.
---
Before playing this game, I had heard almost exclusively bad things about it. But honestly, I love this game, and this community. If 76 is truly "the worst" game in the franchise, then we have a lot to be grateful for as gamers. Godspeed to you all, see you out there in Appalachia.
---
Lucky, my main issue is how much a slope in terrain makes it a pain to place my log cabin or prefab shed and how much stairs refuse to snap to them
---
Especially not prefab stuff like the garden shed or the log cabin
---
I don't think that was the one, but yeah none of them will be super accurate being anonymous and on reddit. The one I remember had more age options and I'm not sure that it asked what system.
---
Usually a power armor glitch from what I know, happened a lot during Fasnacht
---
I happened upon a trap base today. Checked my junk, nothing worrying. Some steel &amp; cloth. No prob. He nuke mines while I’m trapped looking at his vendors, I die. We’re cool, you did it. Then I respawn on my owned workshop to defend from some Liberators and he kills me again while I’m fighting them. Obviously don’t see him come in. Then he fast travels away when I respawn. Kind of a bitch move if you ask me.
---
Well I apparently stand corrected. Just tested this and Vital Equipment was available. Mea culpa for being wrong.
---
Not once
---
Sorry, forgot about the whole context thing for a moment there 😅
---
I mean I don't and won't care about it's PvP applications until I can use it in Nuclear Winter. I'm assuming the AoE is more powerful on players that lack poison resistance compared to...*radroaches* that lack poison resistance, but I can't be bothered lol.
---
Yeah, the one that made ppl look like wendigos? Hilarious.
---
For every decent thing you find in a machine you find 40 people with 5 caps bullets and 200 cap mounted heads. You must like to buy garbage if you can "reliably" find things in machine, that or you just happen to be the first one to swoop in. 99.9999999999999 of all camp vendors are trash, full stop.
---
How do I do that?
---
Fucking yes! My stairs won't snap to shit right now
---
Yeah, same here brother
---
Wish I could give an award but take my upvote :)
---
&gt;Save the Railroad
---
No. They're the worst faction of any faction in any game to date.
---
They're *killing* synths to 'save' them - they *know* it's wrong but continue doing it anyway and have little guilt over it.
---
*You* are the sum of your memories, if your memories are completely wiped but your body remains, *you* are still dead. For all intents and purposes the all (but one, Glory) of the escaped synths that get captured by the Railroad, are killed by the same.
---
The Railroad are *bad* people, if you want to save Synths, don't help them.
---
I like that; like a reverse trap if they pick it up. Now they’re stuck. If only picking up your bag initiated PvP with them.
---
Seems like it's not even worth it
---
I mean, its just gunna be another faction with slow ass rep gain and shit rewards so.......meh
---
Oh and I cant forget, probably a new currency with a shit limit on it.
---
Every time I close my eyes
---
I suggested purely for the testing. Actual feed back from someone you know
---
It's like he thinks he's Saint Francis Gallagher.
---
I do.
---
I hope they reward treasury note too
---
I saw a legendary squirrel once, but that was early 2019.  That chicken is quite a find.
---
I'd dress as a fireman. Ready to put out the flames of Appalachia!
---
I'm a lil confused, does this have to do with NW? also which perks are legendary or how do you know??
---
This sub is so dumb, youre fuckin right and they downvote you anyway. All that salt from 5 cap ammo sellers lmao.
---
The Brotherhood takes control of technology that can prevent us from rebuilding America. If we let it fall into the hands of the raiders, blood eagles, or worse, we're in big trouble. Also, don't trust Russell Dorsey, he's not enlisted in the BoS and is just a fanboy. We appreciate his work so far, but we can't trust that he won't run off with all the donations.
---
...And its completely black.  Doesnt even show up.  Great
---
Nah just not interested in using third party tools to play a game. If I want to sell something it goes in the vending machine.
---
Thanks
---
Someone is horny
---
It doesn't exist yet and it makes me sad.
---
The death claw will scale to him so technically he should be able to solo it . Isn’t that the point of the update?
---
lmao you must have been scammed. lol sucker.
---
YES PLEASE
---
[removed]
---
And giving us legendary perks doesn’t solve any problem. We are not in need of extra power or the ability to slot more perk cards.  you don’t need legendary perks, as such there is no rush to grind out to max them out.
---
Im a big fan of fallout 1 and 2 so im hella hyped for the original BOS comming to f76.
---
I hope it more then just 1 daily ops 
---
It sound like dungeons  which are always good but if it just 1 then it going to bed horrible
---
thank you for the link
---
Oh does this mean nuke zones can go back to providing respawns past the first 20 minutes??
---
Pleeease, it's sad seeing empty nukes.  And high radiation fluid is so tedious this way
---
"i cAN PrICe HowEveR i WaNt"
---
Yeah there is. I liked the atom challenges way better
---
I wouldn't join anything else.
---
Fuck everything else, I want my godamn brahmin grill
---
They tried to develop it first. We just beat em to it and knocked the fight out of Japan.
---
In an alternate timeline, Nazis developed nukes and started Fallout. It would have happened if Einstein, Shrödinger and Oppenheimer didn't defect.
---
Oh, didn't PvPers already do that? I just don't remember seeing the AoE effects tested by anybody so I was shocked.
---
Never even got nuked
---
Germany was spearheading the development of nuclear devices until Einstein et al defected. We're just better Nazis I guess...
---
With all the new and interesting factions in 76 Bethesda went right back to the faction they continually make a major player in their games.
---
Predictable move and I'm not expecting to end up feeling invested in the BoS. Hopefully the writing will make it interesting but right now I'm apathetic at best.
---
Dealer's choice
---
Secondary response: How long before you can find something more effective?
---
Tertiary response: African or European?
---
has 80000 rounds of ammo...
---
3 cap a pop for .38
---
Well I sure hope they are!! /s
---
Nuking camps take way too long. 
---
I usually go to top of the world and scavange for as many frag mines as I can. Then kill a couple of radstags and craft the bait bombs. 
---
Put on demolition expert and grenadier and throw it at their fusion generator, rad shower, or just to a lot of stuff that’s cluttered together.
---
If everyone on each team initiates PvP with each other you could make it work but you'd probably all have to be in a party together and agree to it and coordinate it
---
I’m here to look at the nuka cola sign with the sexy lady on it. It’s the only thing close to a real women I can get.
---
The weapons in LoP are one star.  That combined with the level cap keeps most out
---
Yeah, today I had to shoot a level 1 eyebot three times for over a 1000 pts total dmg before it died. I’m seeing this on a lot of low level mobs. It’s almost like they’ve already implemented the One Wasteland (or whatever it’s called) in places.
---
I like to aim it up at a 70 degree angle and empty the whole belt and then just watch it rain down on the enemies.
---
I dislike em cuz of how horrible they were to the other factions, they were pieces of shit in powered armor bullying their way through Appalachia and taking whatever they wanted. They’re no better than raiders
---
Brilliant idea
---
Thanks for the wiki history lesson
---
There’s a mutation called chameleon. As long as you aren’t wearing any armor and you’re crouching, you turn invisible (obviously the players can see the outline)
---
There’s an Aid item called “stealth boy” makes you temporarily invisible while you move around freely. 
---
There’s a Chinese stealth suit, (basically a hazmat suit) that turns you invisible while crouching and moving while crouching.  You’ll see a lot of people like this during the queen fight because they are using sneak attack damage. 
---
The power armor has a mod for the chest piece similar. Makes you invisible as long as you’re crouching.
---
Found the Jackboot licker.
---
Don't worry. I'll still pull you out of a fire, even if I kinda hope you still die.
---
Screw fighting mutants and hoarding toasters, it's time to make nukashine to sell to the public.
---
My faction is barbarian.
---
Freaking gentrification am i right
---
I’ll take 3 squares a day and a hot shower over cannibalism, vangrant.
---
Shut up and eat your cake. If you're so keen on the taste of leather, put up a flair, bootlicker.
---
Personally I'd prefer the rewards be tied to weekly or biweekly challenges.  Either simple quest chains, scavenger hunt, or something akin to scout badges.  Atom shop is getting a little excessive at this point.
---
Collect 8 and decode for nuke code
---
Or go to nukacrypt.com
---
Long story short : don’t
---
Go to the valet at the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort
---
Oh okay thx
---
Yeah once I figure out how on mobile.
---
I wanted to add that players with other characters feel ripped off too as the packs are awarded to a single character.
---
I don't understand. Its really not that hard.
---
You were already at the location meaning the quest is finished. That's probably why.
---
Abbys bunker maybe?
---
Good to know since I just unlocked that skin.
---
They're for figuring out the nuke launch codes, I've never spent the time to figure a code out though lol just look on https://nukacrypt.com/ they post the codes weekly, big time saver
---
You are just bound and determined to whip this horse into the ground, aren't you? Does getting a crappy one star at level 10 that won't even be useful in 10 more levels really mean that much to you?
---
I feel like Russell is going to join up and get disillusioned at some point. Im guessing there is going to be some sort of fighting within the Brotherhood
---
I just tested my Strangler suit on some low level ghouls at Slocum’s Joe.  It took about 15 seconds to kill them all with the AoE.  Maybe there was some lag or glitch going on with your experience, or the damage increases when enemies strike the suit?
---
Even after the nerf, Strangler armor is better than T65.  There’s very little difference between the damage taken with Excavator or T65.  It’s not worth the grind or expense.
---
Hey guys, I got it to work by getting to the point in new arrivals where you have to have completed this quest prior and then went to analyze sample and worked first try.
---
I'd support the Free States or the Responders. BoS left a sour taste in my mouth since 4.
---
It’s also used to craft Strangler Heart PA, and it took me about 3 weeks to get the full set
---
Boo. Why have a max level? The game basically ends when the enemies cap out and that's always going to be well before you've had time to grind enough to get all the coolest stuff!
---
I have a shotgun build and have the same problem sometimes. It happened to me yesterday in nuked white springs. I’d hit one glowing ghoul and one shot them, then the next couple would take a dozen shots or more. I often aim for the legs to cripple them so I can take my sweet time and fire slowly, be point blank, and watch their half get cut in half, then fill 90% back up. So frustrating. 
---
I primarily use an instigating combat shotgun with faster fire rate.
---
[](/abcutesmile)If you visit someone's camp, and it's being attacked by mobs, it's common courtesy to clear them out. Failure to do so is the truest sign of a Karen in the wasteland, and you don't want to be one of those. :)
---
Legendary run, yes
---
Confirmed on Quakecon streams. BoS themed
---
You still on?
---
imagine wanting to join any other faction than the enclave lmao. u/cy6nu5 is getting the plasma hose.
---
whenever you compare someone to a nazi, you've lost the argument.
---
Yeeessss and even the sound carries really far which  just adds more immersion to the game
---
2 week gap is what they said.
---
First we have to be able to successfully place a blueprinted camp! I swear I’ve NEVER been able to place a blueprinted camp.
---
Waster scum. Clean yourself off and become a member. It has excellent benefits.

My IGN is JWCIII, let's chill

Make it a bed.  Unlocked if you hit max caps.  So you can lie on your piles of money.

---
Going to be called Armor Ace and the Power Patrol
---
in like any open safe maybe. that and the pile of bullion bars too.
---
I wanted to solve it myself. I didn't check to see if I got it right before starting the instance because I didn't realize how frigging long it was. Fortunately, I was right. Of course someone launched a nuke like 5 minutes before I was ready so I had the opportunity to nuke the SBQ fight. I couldn't bring myself to do it. Seemed too much of a dick thing to do because of how much ammo you go through in that fight.
---
Imagine seeing this barrel charging at you in the wendigo cave
---
I'm 1050 atoms from completing it. Haven't decided yet if I'm going to keep going, or just cash out.
---
Does anybody give a damn about immersion anymore?
---
My favorite map is adventure mode.
---
I believe you're referring to American war crimes.
---
Didn't work for me. I got a checkpoint after inserting the blood sample. Now, when I relog I only have the T fuse back and I can't collect other blood samples.
---
All of my characters already do ...
---
You can hate us all you want.. just don’t come asking for help when your camp gets overrun by some ghoulies..
---
By the way, that’s a might fine pip boy you got there......
---
I’m pretty sure we are never returning to the old atom challenges
---
It does. And if you activate the wise mothman you get an xp % boost.
---
I love this idea but what I need is an easy way to swap out perk sets. I find that I'm constantly in that menu.
---
I'm glad the original idea of the Devs playing the Overseer was abandoned, and I'm pretty sure almost everyone else would rather also have the Devs Dev'ing and not live-playing limited role NPCs. If they want to play them let them out in to the wide world as normal player characters who will then experience the highs and lows and lowest of the gameplay...let them suffer as we do.
---
I’m not even sure what they’re doing with all these resources...seems wasteful
---
Kinda fewl a rabk ever 25 levels would be much more reapnable. Starting at level 50, you would need to be 650 to max out 6 cards. Thats a shit load of play time a d probably 2 years + work for most players. And thats only maxing 6 of the what 15+ cards. Actually i think there will be even more yet by the sounds of the ITV
---
I would prefer to spawn real npcs in the camps. Or spawn all allies for examples.
---
SH dupe? Is it tradeable? I thought it was character bound. I know Bethesda sent out those scrap packages when FO1st had the scrapbox wipe issue and there was a disgusting amount of Vault Steel contained in them.
---
I can’t say I’ve had any issues with mysterious radiation damage, but regarding the Queen I might know what’s going on.  If she lands close to you she sometimes has a fairly strong radiation aura.  It’s possible you were getting hit with that.  Otherwise, I’m guessing you caught the edge of the blast zone, which I’ve done more than once.
---
Ľ8i8oiiii8i8io8---------- y 8 minutos en 7877788.
---
What does it say to do?
---
Fuck the Brotherhood!
---
Wow. Didn't know you Jackboots felt so strongly about it.
---
It'd be like having an option to call the Responders.
---
&gt; you don’t need legendary perks
---
It's not up to you to decide what I need and what I don't.
---
Ya, I realize but legendary perks should take awile ya know? I just want a concrete goal and to keep my cards or swap a perk special here or there.
---
I've had several excellent weapons from Murms - it's just a pity she gives Rifles to my Heavy, Heavies to my Gunslinger, and Pistols to my Sniper.
---
It would be great to see power armor choice actually affect something. Because yeah, right now there's no reason to change except upgrades as you level/get T65.
---
And then there's the fact that the armor type that has always been the best in Fallout suddenly isn't. That's... a choice?
---
Not having legendaries be a thing for power armor when they're such a big part of 76 seems like a huge oversight, including for their bottom line since so many of the skins in the Atom Shop are still for power armor. I mean there are always, what, half a dozen?
---
O forgot about them. They're 27 a piece with perks. Not fun
---
It's not wiki. It's facts. I knew that before wiki because unlike some people I take the time to study physics. I was institute in fo4 for that very reason. Wanna talk about perks and benefits, try living at the institute. Lot less creepy robots and a few more people. Remember people?
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
Go join the institute, degenerate. You might even like the books. They're bound in leather.
---
If you don’t want to put in the work to grind you could’ve always cheated and done the GodMode XP glitch
---
Yep or combine it with vampires or something so you get lifesteal all 24 hrs and bonus damage at night!
---
Einstein moved to the US 6 years prior to the start of the German program.  Oppenheimer was born in New York.  And Shrodinger only had a cat that may or may not have been dead.
---
Yea i get ya. Im lvl 250 and have 750 hours on my main, and 250 or so between 2 other chars total. It would take me ATLEAST 2100+ hours playtime to acheive level 650. Thats 3 years, playing 2 hours every single day. Id say thats most certainly a long term goal, especially in video game time.
---
I agree being negative is certainly more popular now so I can see my bias in that sense. But even still negative content is a major aspect of this sub, I feel like the only sub that’s more negative in general about this game is r/fallout lol and they fuckin DESPISE it with a burning passion.
---
Ok
---
What they should have done is had different factions start collection resources (enclave, brotherhood, raiders, and settlers) and see which group could get the most in the event time. Whichever group won would have cosmetic rewards based on the faction (the more donated to all factions the better the rewards)
---
Just... Why?
---
[deleted]
---
So easy one up front. Yes the whole point of Fallout is that the competing commonwealths and resulting lack of oversight the US was split into post WWII  did result in Fascism taking root. Eventually culminating in the Enclave (secretly) completely subsuming democracy and capitalism in America.  
---
But what is the rest of this post? Who is "she", what do Nazis have to do with the launching of nukes, and what do you want options for: costumes, dialogue, quest options?
---
I like this system better, but I think they should add more atoms into the runs.
---
Using nukes in fo76 is basically just a fancy farming technique, radiation and nuclear power has different properties in the fallout universe
---
Plus Modus' Enclave is different than The Enclave in other games. At the moment he tasks us with using nukes in order to hoard resources to help him rebuild his facilities, but we have no idea what his long term goals are really
---
However, it's obvious that Modus is much more inclusive and less xenophobic than the main Enclave faction, considering we can join at all.
---
So maybe his methodology of preserving America will be something more noble than we've seen The Enclave capable of. 
---
As of yet tho, I don't think anything you do as an Enclave member could be confirmed as 100% evil, I mean apparently nuking zones actually cause the wildlife to have immediate growth. I hope the faction and Modus himself gets expanded on later or during the brotherhood of steel content
---
What have I just seen?
---
all the other factions are trash.
---
brotherhood of steal
---
responders planting shitty flowers 
---
free states tinfoil hatting in a fuckin swamp
---
raiders being loitering and doing drugs and cannibalism
---
or, you can have nukes and a fuckin orbital strike platform, good power armor and plasma guns. there is literally no choice here. its enclave, or you are wrong.
---
yup, I'm staying too -- I started at wastelanders and I can clearly say I would not be a fan of this game without the wastelanders content, but, that being said, if bethesda makes one more content expansion as cool as wastelanders -- well fuck me I ain't gonna miss it.  
---
This game is a blast for a certain audience, I love wandering around seeing beautiful things shooting mutants and playing with weapon upgrades, theres a fair amount that annoys the shit out of me -- but overall, it's not a bad game at all at this point.  
---
I'm certainly not quitting cause the ammo converter isn't good enough or some dumb ass nonsense.
---
it was character bound.
---
however using a hack tool there was a way to override the client side block that stopped the trade, and moved the locked items to a nearby container, that could be looted by anyone.
---
So... yes locked, but hackers found a way.
---
Please note, this hack is now fixed as far as i know, as it was also used to duplicate items.
---
Deep pocketed is +10 carry weight per piece. So 2-arms, 2-legs, and a chest means +50 carry weight.
---
Removing that and switching to stealth armor means you lost 50 carry weight.
---
But you only lost 15 carry weight, so something is amiss, but I'm not sure it's marsupial.
---
1-2% of the target health. True of every enemy in the game (I haven’t tested to try and figure out *exactly* what percent, but yeah. 
---
You’ve got good perks, dunno about your gun (Queen is essentially immune to explosives). Gatling gun fires slow though, you’d better be doing a lot of sustained fire to actually get credit if you aren’t a bloodied build (my bloody Gatling hits her for... well, I forget, but my bloody 50cal is about 100 on headshots without adrenaline)
---
no mutations?
---
MADNESS!
---
Go to the fo76 subreddit, click the 3 dots in the top corner and pick a flair
---
And it’s equally not up to you to decide for me if too many perk cards are a problem or not, when I otherwise enjoy the perk card system.  Other people have asked for ways to turn them in.  This is the answer the request.  Just because it wasn’t YOUR problem doesn’t mean it wasn’t other peoples problems. 
---
You still haven’t given an example of what problem the legendary perks were solving to give any evidence that the grind needs to be made any faster than it will already be with the cards
---
Linking to the official boards. This is awesome!

---
it was tested, but it has since been nerfed.
---
People say it was due to dupers, but it was partly due to the effect could cause other players to get massive lag spikes/crashes.
---
Ya, I'm 330 with 1100 hours or so. But I mostly build my camp and farm legendaries nowadays. Perks every 50 might motivate me to hit 350 one of these months. Lol!
---
Right? Gotta love building the nicest CAMP you can and having fug metal stairs in it.
---
Unless you are put back into the same server before finding another one and find 0 vault steel, happened a few times to me.
---
Well said! 👍
---
Just tell me why in the ammo converter menus:
---
1. Buy Ammo is the default option at the top of the list?  If I use it, it's because I have excess to sell.  Sell should be the default.
---
2. After Selling, why does it return to the topmost menu, not the Buy/Sell menu for the ammo I've currently selected as the type I'd like to sell?
---
Yep, I remember a legendary firefly in the toxic valley. I think it's the same thing as fallout 4 where legendary chance is determined by level
---
Why didnt the contemporary bundle come with some? It would have been perfect
---
Is this the Daily: Queen of the Hunt or An Ounce of Prevention?
---
This was on the Bethesda site after a Google search:
---
 📷We are aware and investigating an issue where the terminal is not recognizing the blood sample being inserted after the update on August 4th, 2020.  
---
If you are experiencing this issue, doing the following may resolve the issue:
---
1. Put the T-Type fuse in before the blood sample
---
2. Log out and join a different world and try again.

Screw the card connection at all. All it does is fuck with people who respec a lot, or people who keep multiple versions of cards for different builds.
---
Just make it 1 point per level, and rescale the “Max’d out” to whatever seems appropriate. ESO online maxes at 50(810), which is super fucking high, but hey, goals?
---
Yea im  trying for 300. Motivation has been low the last few weeks. Looking forward to meat week
---
I was just messing around with the perk cards, what mutations are good with this? If I get every single one of them will benefit me or I'm going too far?
---
I've never had an issue. Sorry bro. Look harder. Or maybe give us a quest name.
---
The what?  Never heard of that, citizen.  And I ***know*** my Security Clearance is higher than yours.
---
Were you using VATS?
---
I forget if the Shotgun rubberbanding 90% of the health was in or out of VATS. But I think it works normally for the other.
---
They should get rid of vault steel altogether. You should be able to craft vault armor like SS armor. I gave up on thorn armor. 3 weeks of crafting ad not a useable piece.
---
Meh. Destroying the environment to make mosquitos bigger doesn't sound like anything particularly useful tbh.
---
I mean I understand MODUS' pitch, but frankly it's better topside. Enclave is the Underground equivalent of ivory towers. They're honestly kinda fucking clueless. I liked ZAX better tbh. At least he was honest.
---
Have you read the transcript of their conversation? Zax was just obsessed with being the President. Idk what MODUS is trying to do, but it needs a lot less nukes.
---
I put mine outside fire escape style using an extra foundation piece on the outside to snap the stairs to. Go into the second floor from the exterior. It makes it look more like a tiny apartment building but eh.
---
Yeah I just figured it out I had forgotten to equip my shielded Urban Operative Underarmor that has a +3 STR boost, so it was just a big Doh on my part.
---
👍
---
Are you on Xbox? I don't really use the baseball bat. If I find the plan you can have it.
---
The new ammo converter is worse than before. This interface is horrendous, no main menu means I'm spamming B just to leave the thing. It also doesn't seem to recognize  some of my ammo, saying I don't have enough mini nukes for example, when I clearly have a couple dozen. Tis a shame it's still a mess.
---
I’m hanging onto a little bit of hope that this brotherhood is different since they’re like the first members of the BOS, and I’m hoping the whole Nazi thing the FO4 Brotherhood had going was because of that little twat Maxon becoming Elder and messing things up. 
---
(A brotherhood closer to Elder Lyons, where they want to help people, rather than the “These things don’t deserve to exist kill them all” brotherhood Maxon commanded. If they’re like Lyons I’ll help them, if they’re like Maxon I’ll handle them the same way I did that little shite’s BOS... Complete annihilation.)
---
Like more descriptive than the icons on the bottom right?
---
I do find that sometimes I would like to be able to see what chems/food/drink/diseases I have and not just the icon saying something is there.
---
Well, since there’s a repeatable SCORE challenge for XP, how hard can you grind XP?
---
A remnant of the game that was must remain to kindle the flame of possibility
---
Sure, [here](http://imgur.com/a/unGcULV) you go
---
I'm with you. I completely ignored daily /weekly for the last few months with Fallout 1st giving me all the Atoms I need
---
Ya I got all my bullion plans I wanted so I've been taking a break since the 4th of july and just logging in to buy gold if the BOS has new stuff.
---
Might try the Colossus next week though.
---
I'm sure nobody cares but the way I play my character was an Enclave turned Raider. I liked the idea of finally joining the Enclave but the more I thought about it I was just serving ghosts (as most 76 factions are at this point) so I decided my character would serve himself since we got the Raiders with the Wastelanders update.
---
Being able to roleplay in a game like this is very important, but being told to donate to the Brotherhood with no other alternative is a little disappointing.
---
Imagine if it was a competitive event, people would donate to the Brotherhood OR the Enclave.
---
I would have laughed...
---
Remember, Initiate, we are here to protect the lesser organizations.  That’s our role as the One True National Government.
---
See, now you're assuming things lol.
---
Let me upvote more, Reddit!
---
In a game that has had little to no story content for the last year and a half, imagination is needed to still feel immersed.
---
If you have class freak and starched genes so you don't lose mutations, just about every mutation.
---
There may be some you don't want, but at least marsupial.
---
Mad belly laughs on my end
---
I don't agree but good luck with your travels. Maybe you'll dismiss a vendor and lose out on something big and someone like me will get it.
---
responders tag checks out. why dont you just plant your tatos and be quite while the real patriots do their work.
---
I think you're right, but I would like to know Bethesda's plans for in between seasons: no daily challenges **at all**, or do they start season two the day after the first one ended?
---
You have no idea how hard it is to be like you
---
I was way too pumped to fire a nuke to go through all of it lol good thing you didn't mess it up that would be devastating to loose a nuke card after all of that lol
---
Is class freak worth the 3 points that cost?
---
Decent. Looking. Stairs.
---
It's a bummer that they nerfed them; OP laser weapons are fun. I have a legacy two shot explosive scattered laser rifle. With all the rifle perks, Demo Expert, and Bloody Mess maxed out, that rifle is unstoppable. Though it does break often, that is a drawback.
---
I got you, fam. I need to log in to get the details because I don’t have it memorized. I’ll update in a bit.
---
Great job of that given the existence of The Silver Rush years later...
---
Idk but I love it.
---
I have an executive order direct from the president to root out these commie bastards!!
---
Also don't launch nukes or start encryptid if people are in project paradise dammit! Had that happen 2 days ago and missed both other events
---
Which the immersion is then broken by unrendered graphics :(
---
I mean if we're pointing fingers, China were the ones that shot first nukewise as a fact.
---
I was able to mount mine onto the wall inside my Red Rocket Garage but now I can’t select it to move/delete it. I’ve tried every possible angle, hopefully this bug gets patched soon?
---
I don't think it's luck I think it's persistence. I'm often at max caps and looking for sinks and spend time every day camp hopping and have played this game actively with a few small breaks for around 900 hours. Again you're not totally incorrect in regards to market being better at specific items shopping but just on average a great majority see three stars and look no further which is what causes the thing you are complaining about. To ignore that people regularly stock rares and ultra rares as part of that same mechanic ignorant of their true value only hurts you imo.
---
And i wont care, because i will have traded for what i want 3 weeks before lmao. no need to waste time FTing to gamble on machines. good luck farming noobs and clueless people to find those good rip offs though!
---
Exactly like it is in the pipboy, but on the left of our screen opposite from the quests on screen. It’d be great, but would only work if we had the ability to turn the ones we want to see on screen on and off to avoid clutter (like quest toggling).
---
Doubtful, citizen. You probably don’t even know his name.
---
Why would i need all that when i only play every now and then and already have everything i need whilist im happy with my camp and mt character’s look as it is
---
I ain't a commie I love capitalism but the free states were founded because they thought the government was lying to the people and guess what they were, the free states were right all along
---
It reminds me so much of the way the BOS is portrayed in fallout shelter. "Oh, yay, here is the brotherhood of steel"
---
I am not an avid player of NW mind you I do enjoy it from time to time. Just a suggestion, why not cross NW with the old survival mode allowing everyone to to play the whole map until the last person is standing it may take an hour or maybe 3 just an idea still have the ring of fire but on a larger scale. Yes it sounds slightly different but I would personally prefer a longer battle time than a few minutes rinse and repeat. Or even have a once a month event that gives the top players breging rights until the next monthly championship play off. Mind you once again I honestly don't play NW enough to really have any say into what you would want from this event on a on going basis. 
---
I wish you and everyone all the best!
---
Folks voted for flatwoods in a game I was in the other day. Startled the hell out of me when the deployment selection came up.
---
Based on how bent out of shape you got I’d say they were safe assumptions. 
---
I had a moan about something that annoyed me. You had a melt down and began insulting and name calling all because I had a l moan. Either I hit a nerve or you have some serious rage issues going on. 
---
Either way it was just a whinge. It was never intended to trigger such an emotional response from anyone.
---
Lol true true
---
 then why'd you call me a commie? Let's start a revolution instead
---
&gt; You still haven’t given an example of what problem the legendary perks were solving
---
Because I don't think the purpose of legendary perks is to solve any problem.
---
It's not just the animals it's also boosting the plantlife, look how useful flux is
---
And basically yea Modus is pretty cut off from the world, that's what the bots on patrol event quest is supposed to be him trying to get some eyes back on the surface lol
---
Either way, I don't see the harm in anything he's doing yet, again would love to see his motives explored more either way 
---
If you really want to explore Nazi parralels in the game, I would look into the ghoul faction in The Mire and how prejudices were formed against them, that has more meat to it than just the surface level viewing "oh nukes must be bad lol" in my opinion haha
---
At least we have.... tatos. Fucking tatos.
---
And you can put a disco ball in the deathclaw's mouth - Tricky to place though, a friend did it for me and I don't dare move it.
---
Enclave for the win boys.
---
K.
---
You may want to replay 4 as the memory wipe is stated to be consented and can be opted out. H2-22 decided of his own will to be memory wiped and replaced so the Institute would have a much harder time tracking him down.
---
Huh. The more you know. So I guess Amerika is really just better Nazis. Who knew?
---
It depends on how many mutations you get. If you only have one or two maybe not. With three ranks you can get lots of mutations and get a huge benefit
---
Yeh I’ve come across a few camps being attacked. Even repaired a few turrets to be nice
---
&gt; If she worked on better relationships with the Responders and the Free States then they could of pooled resources and together they all had technology and solutions on how to deal with the Scorched. 
---
This wasn't really possible. The Free States were hyper paranoid and trusted basically no one but themselves. Responders formed something of a relationship with the Brotherhood, but they clearly had no interest in pushing it past what it was. While Taggerdy didn't like working with civilians the Brotherhood still did work with them before the Scorched threat.
---
The game would be so much better if they put one more year into its development
---
Very interesting info.  My leveling route for a long time was simply server hopping Fort Defiance and killing just the ghouls side.  Areas like West Tek and Burrows were my legendary farming routes.  
---
Personally, I’ve taken the path of focusing on having fun over efficiency, typically setting a goal beyond leveling up and focusing on that.
---
youre stating to sound like a commie yourself...
---
treason, is punishable by death. (and a $250 fine)
---
Just because they call me General and I don't wanna be one doesn't mean I'm not. That'll be General T'zenya to you, sir.
---
Some people just don't wanna eat leather and motor oil. I'll stick to my tatos, thanks.
---
If there’s no problems being solved, then it doesn’t matter the speed or manner in which we level up the ranks in it.
---
That's a fair enough point to make, I get thats the difference in the end. The Vault 76 survivors all working together were able to do in a year what the all these factions couldn't do and mostly by using the plans of those factions together to find a solution.
---
If you say so.
---
I've long had one on the side of my portopotty with a mirelurk king's head on the other side.
---
I see, thanks dude, i watched a video on how to get them all, i mean i cant select which one i want, so i think that all of them is better than none hahaha
---
Gianna try it, thanks again :)
---
I set voice volume to zero and turned on subtitles because of that lol
---
The only problem is, it makes too much sense to be put in the game, and if they did, it would probably break half the perks for a few months
---
But yes that's a great idea
---
🤣 no and thank you
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Shotgun build here. You may want to take off Ironclad and replace with Adamantium Skeleton or Fireproof, otherwise you end up killing yourself too much with how close you need to be with shotguns. (Especially if you have an explosive one.) Personally I have Adamantium Skeleton, as my armor takes care of damage.
---
The free orange one? Or was there a different one?
---
People sell serums in their vendors, often for less than 500 caps. I sell a bunch for less than 350z
---
Can you resend it but this time put my name!
---
Jus kidding man
---
I usually find them and tameable deathclaws right on the cranberry glade fast travel point 
---
Saw a tameable glowing super mutant hound once there too
---
If this were implemented literally every player I play with would be maxed them all on day one.  If it were 2 coins about half of them would be maxed on day one.  Level 500+ is not hard and never has been.
---
off topic but you should definitely play fallout 4
---
events where you work as a server to help cook
---
&gt; 2) that Bethesda knows what they are doing. 
---
They didn't even know what they were doing in the past patches so I wouldn't bet or hope on that. Rather hope they don't mess up tooo much.
---
Remove Vampire effect from lvl1. Remove Bloodsucker and Cannibal from lvl2 and remove Dodgy from lvl3 but add Vampire effect and it'd be a pretty badass legendary perk
---
Yeah I mean I get the plot but why are they forcing us to put on Jackboots and just nuke random shit? I liked NV better because you had the choice to side with a faction or create infighting with YESMAN that ended in the rather inevitable cooperation. Enclave just wants to take over the world and while it's kinda cute, it's a bit clueless.
---
I see we have a lot of Enclave loyalists here but frankly I've seen enough Terminator series to see that letting robots run the world isn't the hottest trot.
---
Even with the bug and all I still find that I enjoy it still
---
I haven’t unlocked the cranberry glade yet would you mind telling me a location near there
---
I mean, it’s possible you purchased it by accident (it doesn’t exactly give you a confirmation message), but you can request a refund through their support page.
---
So just put vampire at rank 3 you are saying? Thanks for the input!
---
I'll be searching for serums on the server, I've seen a few on sale but for 1000 at least, I just need to keep looking for them
---
Getting on a server where it hasn't been turned in yet seems to be the workaround at the moment. (Seems to bug out for everyone after that)
---
A private game is a easy way to find one. If you're on PC and don't have Fallout 1st I can make one for ya.
---
Lol i just looked it up on google
---
That’s not the first time I’ve heard that. LOL. My brother has a copy, he supposed to find it for me. I’ll probably have to get on his ass again
---
I'm looking forward to it, playing through fallout 1 again so I can catch any references they may make
---
Yeah they've been playing catch-up since day 1 and it's probably gonna be the same scenario until it dies.
---
But I honestly still love it, I was super hesitant on it mainly for the fact of it being online multiplayer and griefers, but the overall community is amazing
---
*yawn* His name is John Henry Eden and frankly he bores me to sleep.
---
AKA ZAX. He just has a boner for dead presidents. Way to pick the winning side.
---
Never. To the contrary. I once had 100k atoms suddenly appear in my account with my consent.
---
To put it in perspective.  With 4 friends in a team party I can roughly grind out about 10 levels in 2 hours at level 754.  And that's no xp buffs other than the group int bonus, but does include a full unyielding set, not exploited to double it.
---
Citizen, your struggles with the American language are classic indicators of a communist infiltration agent. 
---
I need you to produce your papers. ***Now.***
---
Yeah. Dont make *overpowered* legendary perk cards. Make *badass* legendary perk cards
---
I could be wrong but I think PvP damage has a cap regardless of the weapon.
---
Yes, when I’m stacking food (especially ones with different timers) it would be nice to know if I’m down to my last 5 minutes so I can prep more food, or get ready to be over encumbered from my grilled radstag steak wearing off
---
I had this issue on a wanted level 20 the other day. Used my bloodied handmade. Took him down to 2%ish health. Plugged another 50 rounds into him and he wouldn’t die. Tapped him with a sledgehammer for the last hit.
---
Seriously, Bethesda should abandon this whole scrap your perk cards thing
---
If I take off ironclad and take adamantium skeleton I will have 2 points left, so you recommend me take fireproof 2 or maybe something else?
---
I don't have a explosive shotgun yet, but I'm looking for one
---
This happened to me just In a different order. Steam stopped my sub two days before it's expiration. I resubbed with an annual pass and didn't get my pass. Had to contact steam and Bethesda. Took days to resolve. I'm not entirely sure if it's actually resolved... Another words I have to see if my 1650 atoms comes per month. I feel like it's something they'll mess up 
---
Just completely assault their support system and keep track of all of your dates payment and information.
---
Yep, agreed.  I like rank 3 having the vampire skill.
---
I would have had to hit the button 3 times to get through it...I don't tend to be that impatient. I just don't know.
---
I just crafted about 8000 ammo earlier today no problem, it's so easy.
---
To add to this, if you die right after you down the Scorchbeast Queen, expect someone to run to your bag and loot the stable fluxes you get as a reward. It's going to happen.
---
Ghouls are pretty much just angry zombies. Nothing to see here.
---
Or do you mean the sentient ones that kinda hate everyone?
---
102 m, about 50% there
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Ad Victoriam Brothers!
---
Patches have a 100% chance of having  some game breaking bugs in them, so that's not really a strong argument against having  the app.
---
So sorry, citizen, but there is no such person at this time. Therefore your ‘executive order’ is clearly a forgery. 
---
Produce your papers, ‘citizen’.
---
Probably better off having people submit feed back via pts fourms.
---
And I'm not sure about rank 3 vampire. Might want to pro/con that out, but vampire perk in itself is a good end level perk for that idea
---
[I found a map screenshot that has the location selected with a box around it, does this help?](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/f/f2/Cranberry_Glade_map.png/revision/latest?cb=20190203215751)
---
Honestly, I don't want any of the dead factions revived. It would make no sense. The Free Sates were mostly loners who didn't trust the government and were living in bunkers. They didn;t have interest beyond self-survival. There is no sensible reason for them to be revived. The Responders were literal emergency responders banding together to create some sort of order in the immediate aftermath of the war. Only the Firebreather sub group would make sense to return as it was formed to fight Scorched. Order of Mysteries was more of a shelter for women turned secret espionage agency trying to deal with the Raider threat. They make sense in a more settled, less Scorched Appalachia. While the Scorched are still the biggest threat there probably wouldn't be a reason for them to be around.
---
Honestly, I like the BOS quite a bit, including the different incarnations of them and how they keep changing with times and different leaders be it for the better or worse. I like the story they were given in 76 a good deal as well. All that said, I actually would have preferred they didn't bring them back any further. I would have rather seen new groups and more work on the current Appalachian factions who recently arrived.
---
I don't know, but I still want a way to scrap my cards.
---
You ever game share? My kid shares games with his cousin, and that's how I found out xbox doesn't have any sort of 2 factor authorization. Never leave anything of value on xbox.
---
I'm getting killed really quick sometimes. Low level scorch one hit. Anybody else.
---
Yes Thank you
---
Community is mostly good, the devs just don’t play their own game
---
I want one in the ash heap
---
How do you think I got the damn thing? You and your fucking robobois weren't exactly so welcoming. Also I think we were both responding to the wrong person. Go fight the other roboboi. It's all you're good for.
---
There aren't ranks for vampire, its just the legendary modifier being added at rank 3.
---
Not the case here...
---
Gotcha. That sounds good. Real good.
---
I sort of had the opposite situation as a melee build but agree with the xp. Supermutants are a bit slower to react to melee but ghouls hoarded me quicker and swung faster. I would do both of these locations for my xp run per server but always prefer burrows. I just like the place better.
---
Also consider burrows often has more legendary enemy as less people go there. I've gotten a ton of them. If you nuke burrows as well it's all glowing ghouls which is a blast.
---
Because it's not brave.
---
That happens every once and a while too. Walking around Ash Heap at level 65 and dropping dead out of nowhere is pretty annoying.
---
Please explain
---
You don't get karma from text posts.
---
Does that collectron drop the cave fungus itself or the premade soup?
---
Appalachia is my other home. We might possibly meet in the future. If you see a goomba (or penis according to a friend)  shaped house near the light house, that's my place.
---
They could do it with a tie in to the “expeditions” they are looking to add.  Would be cool as it would be something different.
---
There are actual random spawn items called “cap stashes”. ☺️
---
Claimed it and put it in my camp but because I am doing a Raider theme I put the small letters “KILL THE BOS” down the middle.
---
There little boxes that you find throughout Appalachia. Never in a container(like a desk, or cabinet) always out and about. I’ve never found them to be that rewarding. 
---
Sell purified water if you’re lookin for extra caps.
---
Or, as a passing thought, instead of vampire effect at lvl3, you get 'highlighting living targets' effect
---
I use my b2525 as an ultracite SBQ killer. Here's the link I referenced for my alts build: https://youtu.be/RunhgkMt1Q0
---
I have yet to successfully down her solo though.
---
I said this too and people only said they'd cancel the game.
---
A: They bought the studio that makes FO76 just for that reason.
---
B: It's cheaper to continue on a game than it is to make a new one.
---
But everyone is addicted so no one will quit or cancel their FO1st
---
Mood.
---
????¿¿¿?¿????¿¿¿¿¿??
---
It's a tiny little container that looks like a sardine tin.
---
I have some blueprinted rugged crops I can offer folks~ alas the rugged purifier can no longer be placed from a blueprint.
---
Who the Fuc?- wha? Who is this? i should kick your fuckin ass.
---
Oh? a wise guy huh? look, we'll see how smart you are will internal security crawling all over your fuckin ass.
---
stumbled on a stash the other day with 54 coins,  that’s the most I’ve found so far in one stash
---
You're fucked
---
I don’t know
---
Shit
---
It's weird that you mention this but I experienced the bug where the whole screen turns black except the UI, menu and map for the first time today after 700 odd hours of gameplay, and it happened twice within a few hours of eachother.
---
How do you tame animals?
---
Explosive is great for shotguns as it turns every pellet explosive. Highly recommended.
---
As for the two points - if you’re worried about defense, 2 points in fireproof with explosive shotguns, 2 points in ironclad if not. 
---
My advice - get good armor, then an explosive shotgun, then put the points in Demolition Expert.
---
Perhaps because I do westek so often, I know where all the enemies are, so no berry mentats needed. I'd likely need them for the burrows, not because I don't know where they spawn, but because it's so dark.
---
Did you take into account the amount of time it takes to jump servers? I don't think I would run either more than a couple of times myself. I'm kind of adhd like that.
---
=)
---
No biggie.
---
I'm talking about the friendly ghoul settlement in The Mire that was endlessly targeted and discriminated against by the local survivors. 
---
There are stories all over the eastern area of the map, some very dark.
---
There are parallels that can be drawn between real world history and how they became discriminated against, and what ended up happening to them
---
It's all pretty sad tho, fair warning
---
My understanding is that you’ll have to move the CAMP device. Also, from what I’ve read, you may have lost the space it’s taken up on your budget, but that I’m not so sure of. Best of luck fixing it.
---
To put it in perspective, that's a gross exaggeration, and normal gameplay doesn't result in "Grind out about 10 levels in 2 hours."
---
I play for 2-3 hours a day and earn 1 level. *THAT* is "no xp buffs other than the group int bonus."
---
You have a specialized build for Int, even if you're afraid to admit it. Mr. "Full Unyielding Set."
---
And I guess I'm playing on the wrong servers or system, because I see maybe one or two Level 500 players a week. 700? I can't even remember.
---
Try to imagine you don't use a broken build that involves Unyielding armor, and you are a normal player that doesn't go out of their way JUST to get exp.
---
EDIT: Just to humor you, I checked every level for all the players on the server I'm currently on. I'm the highest, at 316. Second highest is 275.
---
Very helpful
---
Already rocking my Blood Eagle outfit.
---
This game basically trains its playerbase to have stockholm syndrome for real
---
You mean they're not now? As often as 95% shots missed, I thought...
---
Most players are not level 500+ that’s ridiculous.
---
Serious question. Why not just divide the totals needed by 5? I mean if that's your solution it would be more simplified and manageable with smaller numbers. So just do your solution but in reverse.
---
Damn hit him with the fallout 2 dialogue. Its over lmao.
---
Thanks a lot dude, Will do :D
---
That’s what it’s called. A cap stash. It’s a little box with a stash of caps in it.
---
There was someone who mentioned recently it can be possible that your controller still operates the UI even if you're in your dashboard, so that may be what's happened in your case. Bit of a weird bug, though a refund request should hopefully sort it out.
---
Its the Limb Damage ones that are the magic weapons as i recall
---
Haven't tried it but it might be considered unplacable because it's considered a nearby settlement or whatever prompt it is when you try to place a camp near a building
---
I'm not sure why they're even implementing this, no one has been asking for it. After the game got a significant difficulty nerf last year, it's very easy, especially at early levels. Part of the Fallout experience is wandering too far off the beaten path and getting smacked down by a high level mob. I'm very dubious that it'll be implemented well.
---
Lame, I was really hoping it would be mothman themed due to september being the month point pleasant holds their mothman festival, oh well.
---
Of course in FO1&amp;2, they were the shit.  However, it was already a nonsensical break from the brand of the games when Bethesda set FO4 on the east coast.  Shoe horning the BOS into those games made little sense, and even less in FO76.  Vault-tec/boy was supposed to be the branded characters that tied each game together, so you could have whacky wasteland factions that crop up in each region.  Forcing the BOS into every region really homogenizes the games and pushes the limelight away from the unique factions.  If you didn't have BOS in 4, for example, there could have been a lot more done with the Railroad, Minutemen, or even the Atom Cats.
---
They cant do it in a public team
---
whoever did that you joined a private team or they were on your friends list
---
*We see you are intent on staying. The Enclave congradulates you on your stellar decision, and would like to know your location. For your own safety, of course.*
---
I do like that more, but the Devs have enough trouble with Multiplication, forget DIVISION.
---
So it would be 10 Coins for first upgrade, 20 for the second, and 40 for the Final. Those are pretty nice numbers.
---
EDit: never mind, thinking of the wrong perk!
---
I'll give you $200 for it.
---
Bro,  i vape.
---
Ok, that's a good point, but I would rather imagine other factions, rather than flocking to what essentially is a cargo cult.
---
I think the op means why hasnt any of the npc factions taken up residence there
---
So it does or doesn’t affect PA? Lol your OG answer isn’t there haha
---
Its also a pretty long ways away from water or a vendor. Any spot I've ever placed my camp has always had one or both of those things in order for me to want my camp there.
---
No, a body isn't considered a cap stash, like everyone else mentioned there are random places where you can find small boxes with tape around them that say "CAPS", that's a cap stash. The most notable place i've found them is outside Vault 94 in a small shack.
---
From angry turtles video the 3 are bash damage, 33% vats hit increase, and 25% faster fire rate

[Here’s my build ](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f83389a&amp;d=sd2su2so2sp2sf2p02p10pc2p30eo2c60ce0cd0ib4s12a72as2s72l71lt2lu2l11&amp;m=051c29feb6i) FWIW
---
Your Gatling gun is too slow ... try anything over 200 fire rate she’s pretty much immune to explosive dmg ... a simple non legendary 209 fire rate mini gun or a light machine gun will easily give you enough damage every time  or do Beckett’s quest and get the “final word” it works great
---
They invited me to a team and since one was nearby a place I needed to go I joined
---
50 cal skin? I didnt even see that.
---
A+ comment right there
---
I donate because i like boom balls
---
hrm i always heard the limb damage one is also magic. i know with the 33% vats, it can stay broken and you never use AP at all so its crit after crit
---
You should only play 4 for graphics and mods. The story is absolutely trash
---
I'm just a sucker for taking the easy way out. I hate big numbers because effort.
---
I sell most plans for 25-30c and recipes for 5c.
---
Welp ya live and you learn. thats in your camp forever now unless Beth can somehow delete them all out of  budgets
---
Yes
---
Was the server laggy? FFR magic doesn't work in that condition
---
The item itself. Soup can be made from it in the standard way
---
Yeah, never join private teams you don't know with glitches like this happening.
---
I've never had any problems with it, it forces you to be more creative
---
It's a gray metal box/tin can rectangle in shape and looks like tan tie over it. It will be labeled cash stash. No bodies or other containers are cap stashes. If you have fortune finder perks, it will make a noise when you near by. When you have the perk it will double or guarantee a double cash.
---
I was one shooting anyone that I did a critical in VATS to but I was taking so much damage waiting for a crticial so I just had to be in my fusion coreless Power Armor so I couldn't use VATS.
---
Service connected combat veteran here. What's your IGN I'll hook you up with things to get you ahead. If you're on discord we can text chat there to see what you need. Discord: Vault310#0077 IGN: Vault310
---
i am confused. Is there an employee named beth or does it standfor Bethesda
---
It wasn't ffr, I have bash damage as the buff
---
It was indeed because it was crashing the game at the SBQ event when it tagged too many enemies at once!
---
Here's me still wishing I could put pool balls on my pool table.
---
Yeah I mucked that up good and proper sorry as I mixed it up with Sturdy Frame! White Knight only works for regular armour.
---
Power Armour has its own perk in intelligence called Power Patcher that does the same thing for it as WK does for regular armour. It's also largely worthless having it equipped full time as PA tends to break rather slowly. Better off with something like Power User instead and just swapping when you do eventually need to patch it up.
---
*Eden doesn’t exist yet, and doesn’t take over as President of the Enclave until after the destruction of the Poseidon Oil Rig.  You’re a few decades early.* 😉
---
I mean that's good to know, why I'm here actually, trying to get the right magic weapon to get the queen done in seconds, tired of dumping rounds into her just to get a 1* assassins pickaxe &gt;:(
---
Yet everywhere you look on this /r BoS gets so much hate. People project so heavily, when they think of a militarized faction in post apocalypse. If shit goes down, they'd be happy just to be fed daily and have a bedding.
---
I could'nt test it before and my friends are unable to tell as well. 
---
But sadly. For now it seem the effect don't stack with the number of bullets fired but only the shot like anyother weapon. 
---
But the question is good. I will try to give you informations if i get to know more.
---
I have to admit, I’m somewhat impressed.
---
You don't get a choice in the matter.
---
Yeah that was my bad, should’ve been more specific
---
The tickets appears on random Scorched and Ghouls, OP is talking about the small codes from the Officers to decode the nuke launch codes.
---
If you don't like the game, why are posting on it's reddit?
---
Hey cool! Thanks for spread the word
---
Wait until one wasteland
---
I was a bit disappointed they made fertilizer and not eggs.  I wanted to use the barn set to make a huge chicken egg farm.   Appalachia's Best.
---
ps4, I don't either as much as I used to, but I'm dedicated to get all the mods for it cx
---
I hear ya i use a Junkies GatLaze and GatPlasma one with ffr an other with lmb dmg
---
most SBQ fights are over in 5 mins
---
we like to let her land for the mob xp
---
You should praise this, not trying to remove it. It is like a gift from Jesus.
---
The Silver Rush keeps their products under control. They are not a threat.
---
I just wish he'd just do his job and sell booze to our customers! He only ever wants to sell to his landlord!
---
This whole system sounds like it is designed to make people quit. It's just like the reputation with Wastelanders. Rep grind can be fun but having to grind 3 quests 10,000 times is NOT fun.
---
I just had the same thing happen to me tonight.
---
I've only been playing for like 3 months and I'm level 303 haha did you use the lunchboxes? as far as score being something only hardcore players finish that seems a little silly cause you can easily do the dailies. Theres still ike 3 weeks left lmao.
---
https://youtu.be/kXIP4GTQrV4
---
This video explains it in a short time on how to decode the code, while it's honestly bothering to do so, decoding it feels like you won a trophy. You could always look up the codes if you don't have the time as well.
---
Yes and no. They might have bullied other factions for supplies but they where also raging a losing war against the Scorched while the other factions mostly sat on their butts either fighting/raiding each other or pretending to not let it be their problem and growing farms etc. If this was a real world issue this day in age I can guarantee we would have this happen as well.
---
The mutants, cannibals, and cultists stay as well. (And any combination of the three)
---
I happened to be up at freak show when the queen got nuked a while back. It was a great view of watoga and the nuke going off in the distance. Managed to time it just right and got a few good pics
---
Rip lucky they didn't put it in an area I wanna build in
---
We should do a quest to recruit Sophia or somebody else that fits. Then we help them get everything up and running. Then we hand the reigns over to them so that they can run the organization.
---
I found him at the bottom of the stairs there, lurking almost under them, leaning against the wall.
---
I wish it didn't have that bulky ass tire on it, it makes it so much harder to be creative with my builds!
---
They didn’t really have a choice, they were fighting a losing war to protect everybody and no one actually took them seriously when they told them about the zombie plague over the mountain, they were starving, undermanned and running low on ammo and their former allies stopped trusting them, so they got desperate which just dug their grave faster, they’re flawed but not evil
---
I have yet to find the plans for the mirror ball, when i do im definitely putting this up in my bar
---
Imagine spawning at a camp to see a deathclaw or mega sloth jogging on a big treadmill.
---
Burrows has been absolute trash every time I’ve run it. Zero legendaries. Granted I’ve only tried once every month or two at this point, but yeah.
---
man, thx for the info! , i build myself one here:  [finalized version](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d92755f&amp;d=su2sd2so2sp2a72lt2lv1lr1ic4cu2c72p02pe2pc2eu0lk2ld2l71sf0a01ek0&amp;w=em0ep0a30l10)
---
That's one thing they acted upon out of many that we asked for.
---
They are literally owned by a crime family and Veronica even states flat out they *fucked up bad* when she lays her eyes on the sheer stash.
---
That’s actually never been officially stated, it could very well be America enclave heck even some theories that vault tec did it, of course it’s assumed by everyone China did because they live in the remains of America with all the anti Chinese  propaganda. Of course if Pam is right it might have been them but Pam isn’t exactly straightforward
---
YES!  Thank you Nukacrypt!!!
---
Damn, 13? 
---
I need to roll with your crew.
---
I really hope this includes fixing entering Spruce Knob to kill Rocco
---
They're kinda useless though. Unless you use them to really scope a recon scoped rifle is better. You can track + kill stuff with it
---
I make a leveling alt that I kill and restart at lvl 11 so this is a great event for that toon.  When you were new this was a great way to get some kind of legendary gear.
---
So when the duper’s had the last weapon dupe. I was in watoga and at the vendor there was a junkies magic mini and a junkies gat plasma. I bought them and next day I realized there was a dupe from a YouTube video. So I’m guessing I caught the weapons before they loaded back in or someone didn’t know what they had. But tonight finally I logged into server and a queen fight was going on instead of always joining server and the fight already being over. Well I use my fixer which even with perks but no chems I can hit around 200 for headshots sometimes. But mostly around 100. Wasn’t a lot of ppl fighting so when she landed I pull mini out and it doesn’t destroy her like I’ve seen in videos but I can see it slowly taking her life away. But I also wanna know how to do this. I wanna solo queen I got 20 nuke cards just waiting for right weapon. The purveyor gave me my first bloodied fixer but it’s only 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage.
---
Not sure if I even have the plans... I got lucky, when I finally got my first base built, a team of high level day one players came and decorated it for me. But now I don't want to scrap anything because I don't have most of the plans.
---
I completely agree with this. The funny thing is, there's no real benefit to Bethesda to get us to log in daily. The Atom shop only updates once a week, so if anything, they should just want us to be online only once or twice a week, from a purely financial perspective.
---
For me, I just outright stopped playing the game when Seasons came out because the addictive nature of FOMO became too distracting from the game itself, and I just stopped having fun. It's not a great system.
---
Im ok with the brotherhood featuring in 76.. but then again.. there are so many NEW factions already in 76 like the Responders which bethesda could easily capitalise on (the brotherhood doesn’t have to be in EVERY fallout game is what im trying to say lol)
---
In FO4 I really enjoyed shooting Elder Maxson in the face. Jus' Sayin'.
---
It’s based off your highest level character. Once you hit 300 on your ‘main’, that’s it. For now.
---
Yeah I’m not exactly a fan of someone pointing a gun at me and demanding all my resources and food just so they can fight a losing battle. A battle that a bunch of vault dwellers were able to win, while they a whole heavily armed group of trained soldiers couldn’t.
---
Okay awesome! So I can safely get rid of the 3 points in agility and put them somewhere else?
---
First it was a guitar, then it was the piano, now it's the bass!
---
You may want to get up and replay FO2 (Richardson flat out states China shot first and it's quite clear in the whole dialouge with him that he does not lie), FO3 (terminals you can find note nukes from China first), New Vegas (Gobi Campaign Scout Rifle implies the US was getting quite deep into China itself through the Gobi Desert) and Fallout 4 (Switchboard automated response noted nukes from China first and advised a counterattack).
---
It isn't a theory. Games from both Obsidian/Black Isle and Bethesda multiple times have stated China shot first as a panic due to the US troops breathing down their necks.
---
In heavy weapons you need the faster fire rate and the game running smoothly. It's explained in the video. Bash, limb and 33vats works on weapons that fire multiple rounds at once.
---
I test it myself with an AA25 LMG and an I33 LMG. The AA melts the rocks
---
I like this idea, take my like 👍
---
Doesn’t look too bad. I personally had an issue with gun fu working against me using a pump action. Worked fine with combat shotguns and double barrels. I think it waits to swap targets until the next round is in the chamber, which doesn’t happen until after you pump on a pump action. Good enough for something like westek. But at Encrypted and Scorched Earth I had a hell of a time getting a lock on relevant targets (those being the most imminent threat). It kept moving on to the furthest targets, but only after chambering the next round. Kinda left me as a sitting duck.
---
People get really upset when you fix the missile turret at the Line in the Sand event.
---
I have never once defended a workshop
---
Yeah me 2
---
Be lazy all you want, I don't care, I barely need to expend ammo anyway.
---
Are you gonna try to fix the Ammo converter again. This time for reals please!
---
It's based on framerate. You need to maintain a high framerate (60+) for the entire duration of the damage. Turtle mentioned this in his most recent video about magic weapons.
---
Presumably your damage applied per frame ends up eclipsing the server tick rate, which causes it to report back inaccurate damage values. Or something... I dunno, I'm not entirely sure how only those particular legendary effects apparently work differently to the rest.
---
Anyways, SBQ fights can get quite laggy at times, and frames can suffer as a result, meaning sometimes magic damage is harder to trigger.
---
Me2 and this happened while fighting a deadclaw smh
---
I usually show up to the unpopular events, but don't set them off, just to see if anyone else wants to do anything fun. It usually ends in disappointment but there's the rare occasion that people catch on. I can explain them to any of you who are still confused by them.
---
I feel like LoP is already like that because it's an easy 3 legendaries to knock out dailies/weeklies. Plus the scrip amount is the same regardless of level. I am around level 180 and will do that event every time it pops.
---
The preset prices are often not the actually value of the item. Most of the time, players sell items less than the default value. However, sometimes you get rare items which are worth alot more than the default value.
---
So, it is extra confusing. The best thing to do is look around at player's vendors to get an idea of what everything is worth before you start selling. Keep in mind that vendors will vary and some will be more expensive than others.
---
Edit: Prioritize higher level player's vendors since they will often know what the going rate for items (although this is not always the case).
---
I find the Brotherhood Medical hood clips nicely with the Enclave Scout Mask.
---
YES.  I wish that Bethesda would release a few CAMP item recipes for things like this.  I had a few ideas myself.  One such as yours could be a recipe to craft a money bed that would require something like 200 stacks of pre-war money.  My ideas were things like a [stuffed animal hammock](https://miniowls.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hammock07.jpg) that would require you to have one of every type of Mr. Fuzzy to craft.  Another would be a pie display that would require a couple perfectly preserved pies.  Another could be something like a medical skeleton that you could craft if you found all the bones for it.
---
List coulda easily went 25 for sure
---
I tried cancelling my sub and then purchasing again and it seems to have worked as if renewing it, while not getting duplicated on steam it still appears as one, and in fact I got a "thank you for renewing" email
---
There are people who have been playing Everquest for over 20 years.
---
Similar numbers for FFXI, WoW etc. based on when they started.
---
This system is meant to last, not be auto-completed by people already playing.
---
Why the hell would you make a system that just gives people stuff and has nothing to work towards?
---
And I mean, hell, I just got 2 levels today on my over 300.  1 was in ten minutes at Line in the Sand and 1 was doing a few dailies, Heart of the Swamp and something else in less than half an hour.  And that's without really trying.  Wait until a double or triple weekend comes up and I start cracking all these lunchboxes.  Easy 100 levels.
---
In summary, this system is for the long term and for people that don't suck at the game.
---
AA25 doesn’t have bash/limb/33vats yet still magic?
---
Mine was all over the big heart bed in my Megaton apartment... Along with my gnome collection.
---
thx so much for this, hybrid is sooo tempting
---
And now you can join many more events and get more legendary gear. I fail to see how losing exclusivity on one event while gaining the ability to join and actually participate in Line in the Sand, Heart of the Swamp, every other Horde event, SBQ, Free Range, One Violent Night, Uranium Fever, Monster Mash, and more is a net negative in your mind. At this point, you seem to be complaining just so you can make noise.
---
How does one tame something once you pacify it? I've pacified a few wolves and mongrels, but they go back to attacking me after a few minutes. I'm trying to get a pup for my camp!
---
Nice
---
Are you using VATS? I one shot kill stuff all the time with VATS. Without vats, I will experience rubberbanding. It can suck when I am trying for longball headshots.
---
I get it every time I pick crops
---
The *only* thing fun about trap bases is nuking them.
---
Ok I'll give that a try. Thanks
---
Howd you get him to stand still in photo mode?
---
Neither. It's my mom's name.
---
3/7 would recommend this list to a friend
---
I actually posted something about this a while ago I thought it would be a good idea too but everyone said it would break the game most likely
---
Well played.
---
Hey man, ill add you later when I get home Agent_Sempai
---
I love these ideas. I would spend a week for sure grinding that and would love every moment!
---
That’s what motivates me to use magic too, it’s pointless to waste a ton of ammo on a one star walking cane.
---
Yup, they'll just be more ammo and stim packs for the raiders.
---
You know what, you're right.
---
Bethesda should cater to elitists and snobs like you, and not the 99% of the rest of the fanbase.
---
How dare I "suck at the game." I should just stop playing.
---
So much hate... What can men do against such reckless hate?
---
Part of the crew part of the ship
---
I went with the robot models. The six fit perfect in the Thanksgiving display! So satisfying
---
I must've missed something. Is this a new form if griefing? How does it work?
---
I don't know the amount of XP it gives but I'm pretty sure the constant mass slaughter at Guided Meditation, Line in the Sand, and Radiation Rumble will easily top it.
---
I think, like Fasnacht, this is more about easy mode scrip generation than XP.
---
True endgame...why the fuck am I over encumbered?
---
I already have, twice
---
It would make a good pole for the basketball hoop, if we didn't already have a hoop with a pole. Or maybe you could make an art gallery for people with jet packs to enjoy.
---
I am here to stay as well, as long as  Bethesda smartens up there act, and starts, making  something of this game, and starts listening to there player base, and stops telling half truths. 
---
I have played over 3700+ hours at this point. I May go off the deep end from time to time, because I don't like being toyed with,  or played like a fool by the parent company that is behind this game. And in addition to this I have forked over more money 💰 on this game than most. 
---
So I do feel I have some entitlement from time to time to speak my mind about the current state of Fallout 76, and not everyone may agree,  but I will stand my ground and say my peace,  regardless of the outcome, because I am a man  of my word, and I expect that in return. 
---
 Yes, I can be your best friend, or your darkest enemy it all depends on how the dice are rolled. At the end of the day.  
---
I  love this community ❤ for the most part, and that is the only thing keeping me playing day in, and day out, I enjoy helping others were I can, and being the wasteland vigilante to those who choose to bully others around  the wasteland,  and it's no different in the real world. 
---
I come from a breed people that have had to fight for every thing in their lives inorder to survive, and I only seek the best for all of man kind, my closest friends away from this game are some of scariest individuals you will ever encounter, and that gives me an edge over most, and keeps me grounded. 
---
I appreciate the work that has gone into this game, mind you I feel that the management has lost touch with there player base, and it inferiorates me to no end. I know how to pick my battles, but cross ✝️ me and you won't see it coming. 
---
That being said, If I say I am walking away from this game it for good reason. I have walked away twice now because,  of the reasons above. I am back because I choose to be here, just as much, as I can choose not to be here. 
---
I can't be controlled, and a late I find that this has become more and more of a current feature of this game. Hence the fact I no longer serve my country as a soldier of fortune. 
---
 Some of  us say we are leaving for good reason, sometimes that reason may not make sense to most,  but in our eyes 👀 it to enforce a point. Because without us this game would have come to end long ago. 
---
I apologize for the justification, but I wanted to point out that some of us, only want the best out come for this game, and the community that plays it. 
---
On another note I do truly wish 😌 you, and everyone all the best, including the team at Bethesda. We need to work together to provide a strong foundation for this game 🎮 if not then what is the point even moving forward.
---
Oh shi-- I forgot I'm in a time vortex. Looks like ZAX is only just starting to find things "interesting". Mostly president Lincoln by the logs I'd read in the bunkers.
---
They don't always work
---
I def prefer the legendary run but I hear ya
---
Give my slothy a giant scratching post bethesda!
---
A visionary
---
They could have programmed me to love, to forgive... member.
---
I'd take off critical savvy and better criticals. Four leaf clover and grim reapers sprint are more then enough to have constant action points and crits every couple hits. I'd get ricochet and serendipity instead. Your build Is very similar to my own and I one shot everything. Once you get a good enough gun you can even take off damage perks for quality of life ones like weight reduction. 
---
Personally I hate gun fu. Vats lingers on enemies too long before switching when I can click on the next one faster then it can switch. But that's just my own preference.
---
My only other advice Is to decide if you want to be a full health or a bloodied build. If full health aim for vanguard armor and add the born survivor perk card. If bloodied get unyielding armor and the adrenal reaction mutation but you'll also want starched genes perk. But play whatever way sounds most fun! I do both between different characters.
---
There are some mutations that are always good like marsupial and speed demon. I personally think every shotgun build should have the grounded mutation as well.
---
Edit: I noticed some people suggesting to take off ironclad. For me personally its a must but it can really depend on your specific shotgun. I don't do gauss or explosive but I also modify my armor to help against that kind of damage. There isn't a wrong way to do it you've just got to find what works for you!
---
Walk away before it starts beeping again
---
I would buy for 12K caps
---
Imagine doing a bloodied loadout
---
I'm not leaving. Definitely not anytime soon. But I'll definitely be more active when work will let me go home. I really appreciate this game!
---
I had zero idea that was what those codes were for. The more you know...🌈⭐
---
A fellow Keith I see
---
Had this happen to me.... you have to move your camp and then delete the blueprint for the stored item list in the build menu.
---
I thought I was going crazy till my wife heard it too!
---
Just don't expect to put any words on the front of them. They have a bizarre hit box and anything you place floats a few inches in front of it. They still look pretty cool, but it would be nice if you could label them properly.
---
Right? Deathclaw nest... sloth scratching post ... mirelurk king hell pond ...
---
Looks like legendary run is here to stay. Personally, I never did daily atom challenges. I'd just be playing and then I'd get that notification, and I'd be like, um...ok. but that's it.
---
Thank god for reddit! I am in the same boat and have the same issue. As annoying as it is, I like that I am not the only one
---
I sometimes do but with vats ai can't do that much damage
---
All these people are really ok with their current system. That's whack
---
It was a trick question. Eckhart was President for a few years after the Great War, but from about 2086 up until I think around 2200, we don’t have any specific names in lore. So right now, in 2103, we don’t know canonically.
---
Yeah, like i said. Heavy weapons needs fast fire rate for the magic to happen. It isn't the same magic the shotguns have. I'm using a lot of weapons with various stats (mostly Two Shot as primary and any of those 3 secondary) plus a Blocker piece of armor and I can't explain very clearly how but I'm making it happen with all of them
---
The ghouls can 1-shot you if you're bloodied and also pack radiation which you need to deal with, so is worse until you really have the spawn points down.  The super mutants can't 1-shot you and if you use a vampire shotgun (which still 1-shots everything for me) you are unkillable to the mutants.
---
They should change Nocturnal to be an effect that removes radiation or something.  Far more useful.
---
I didn’t do the gnomes. I did the pre war money, whisky and a godly pile of Chinese assault rifles
---
I found 154 in a stash one time.  You dont see them much
---
We have the same build aha😃
---
No speed boosts stack. The highest you can get is 25% with speed demon and strange in numbers.
---
You probably ate a rad-x instead of your mutations are suppressed
---
I imagine that would be a good seasons event between the two current major factions, with Wren from Crater and Penelope Hornwright from Foundation attempting to use their tech know-how to hack into said robots, which could then trigger hidden robots to attack, leading up to a final boss-type legendary robot (sentry or assaultron).
---
The end of the season could be an update to Pricketts fort showing which faction won, depending on how many players sided with each side.
---
Still an issue on Xb1
---
Nocturnal, Troubleshooter, Zealots etc. shouldn't exist.  They're not legendary, they're trash.
---
Rolling pins, pool cues etc.shouldn't exist as legendary.  They're not, they're trash.
---
I think that got added today
---
Imagine imagining.
---
They are gone for good.
---
I found a tamable sloth on the road that leads to foundation. Fast travel there walk the road back until you get to the intersection. Theres a few things that can spawn so maybe try your luck there
---
I recommend "the lazy shotgunner"
---
https://youtu.be/_m600RZ27Rk
---
Make changes to fit your play style. Personally I recommend class freak/strange in numbers and almost every non-melee mutation except adreanal/healing. Also, herbavore is better but less lazy.
---
Well you got my vote of course!
---
Eh, I’d be quite happy to have it to be honest. Quite frustrating to wander into an area that’s normally pretty tame, but because some high level player had been nearby earlier, I’m having to waste loads of my already fairly low ammo stock just to kill a few feral ghouls. Unless I’m mistaken on how the scaling works.
---
Yes, bug report it, it's been there since it was made.
---
They'll tell you to send them a video because they're worthless trash that just want to avoid doing their damn job and like making life tough for you, but hey, it's really all you can do.
---
Question: does dropping a nuke on these locations change things? IIRC it turns the ghouls in the burrows into glowing ones, which I assume give more XP (and might be easier to spot). And would the gain be big enough to justify the time spent going through the silo if you plan to grind for, say, an hour?
---
we live in a society.
---
They're aware and won't be attempting to fix it.
---
Why not. I want that Collectron
---
gamer tag redzone04. Semper Fi
---
I can't comment much on any of this but I would say the extra sneak capability that the Fixer gives is a factor.
---
How do you tame things?
---
This is great! This way Sophia can shut the hell up about the stupid headaches and nightmares and bitch about that crap in the damn mansion as far away from my C.A.M.P as possible.
---
See that would be really neat, and interesting. I just feel like it’s such a wasted space
---
Holy handmade I would have missed that. Thanks!
---
It hasn’t truly been confirmed yet. There are plenty of signs pointing to other groups.
---
I used to move my camp around a lot. I'd find just the perfect spot and spend a hour walking around the site and just spinning the blueprint till it went green. 
---
Once I found my river spot in the top NW, I havent moved since.
---
Yes, everyone gets the reward as long as enough other people contribute. You claim these rewards by going to the Atom shop. Right now, the barret and the banner should be there free.
---
Yeah they will be in the atomic shop for you
---
To be honest 13 was a new record for us.
---
Shotguns are broken like that.  They are either completely worthless or magic.  You did something to shut your magic off.  Put your "15% damage reduction while blocking" armor back on and use VATS.
---
6 slots in total.
---
Prefer the Run
---
Well i guess i shall not complain cause i was getting them for every event, even dailies up until this week. Haha.
---
There is some trick with shotguns, VATS, and "magic" legendary effects that supposedly makes shotguns very good.
---
I'm not into shotguns, I use different levels of sniper rifle for different ranges. Gauss for extreme/long range, Lever for medium, Fixer for close.
---
I dont know much but im assuming its based around the 3x sneak attack bonus when you max out the one  card.
---
Huh, weird how in 2 timelines china ends up fucking the world
---
Seriously why not just add them as a scrap option to get gunpowder, copper, lead, steel, plastic etc?  No need for a separate machine at all.  Like FNV.
---
Don't want to bother with reloading?  Try using the reload glitch shown in this video:
---
https://youtu.be/xXR2diJEnFA
---
It is amazing when using it with the one-shot VATS shotgun thing...  :)
---
Hell yeah. Also, will never happen.
---
All the ones you listed are already filled with high level players 1 shotting.  LoP was always a safe event for noobs because it was crap rewards for everyone else.
---
The Fixer improves sneak moving speed significantly, synergizes greatly with Perception and has a lot of customization between ammo type / full auto and semi auto...to name a few.
---
Here’s the thing. The BOS you describe doesn’t exist yet. That’s why I don’t really get all the hate from a RP perspective. Right now all the BOS is would be a collection of former army units trying to stabilize the post-war world. 
---
I mean, anyone who has played the other fallout games knows what they will turn into, but if you are holding a grudge based on that, I’d dare say you are being disingenuous to the idea of RP. Hate them for what they are now, not what they will be later.
---
Ok thank your for the info.i would put an emoji here. But NO
---
Thank you for the help.
---
I been chasing ppl with chainsaws again, someone made 2 posts about me, which I am flattered. I'm new to reddit lol anyways I'm here to stay as well. Though my heart will always belong to the Institute.
---
Will not being able to enter Spruce Knob Boat Rental be fixed for From Russia With Lev?
---
Looks naked so probably one of the glitch spawns.
---
My BACK...ugh
---
I don't do stealth because I suck at it, but automatic rifles are super fun. If you just tap the trigger, you only shoot one maybe two bullets, and when needed you can hold the trigger and light shit up.
---
Sometimes mobs will just freeze in the asset mode and won't be killable or interactable. They can only be shot at, and sometimes come decapitated.
---
I was thinking the same
---
I assume for dps on tanky enemies like the PP alphas, sbq, probably Earle Williams.
---
With my bloody stealth commando everything else is done in one shot sometimes two.
---
Ugh maybe one day
---
Dang it carl!! I knew i forgot to lock the coop.
---
No. 4 ash heap
---
Nice, I use a TS bashing mini for magic, I didn’t realize high firing speed alone can do magic, I always thought you need one of those three (limb/bash/33).
---
After the popularity of the hidden silver shroud dialogue options in 4 I was sure that there would be some option to casually drop a mention of the order in her questline somewhere. She even has a short dialogue branch about who you would be in the MM comics.
---
These PSAs are really helpful, thank you. If it's wasn't for these I wouldn't of gotten my thanksgiving shelf, thanks again guys :)
---
Animal friend level 3. Perk card in Charisma. Equip it and walk up to a docile mob in one of the random encounter locations (specifically a scene location) and then you get the option to tame it and send it to your camp. 
---
There’s info all over about how to do it and where to find them.
---
Because of this, I made one of me giving a wet Willy to a scorch and OMG his expression is priceless lol
---
That's the game she plays. 
---
If she actually gave the right guns to the right people, why would they continue to do business with her? The strategy is to entice them with awesome weapons - just not the RIGHT weapons. That way they keep coming back for more.
---
Like a super compact royale? I for one would love a map in the Mire. Full 'nam vibes
---
They weren't wiped out, but severely weakened and driven westward to Flatwoods.  The Responders' training course took them to the ruins of Charleston.  But yeah, the Raiders ruined everything.
---
So you can access your 1st stuff now? I just logged in to find I havent auto renewed and am now unsubbed lol
---
Edit: Canceling and re-subbing worked, thanks!
---
No worries, I'm allergic to emojis
---
Yes. Just go into the atomic shop and claim the banner.
---
I've had that happen before too, I find it pleasant actually lol
---
Honestly? For me, mostly aesthetic and fun.
---
 
---
Shotguns and melee in endgame can be too easy. Sometimes the best way for a good challenge isn't just for the game to change: but also your style/build.
---
It’s bugged and being patched on tuesday
---
id rather they add a food preservation system. something like how me make flux, use a different item (that isnt super easy to get) so that we can reserve any food we want.
---
Well I can shoot from more than 12 feet away, and can shoot  25 rounds that do 1.5k damage each in like 4 seconds. I use a BE15r and B2525 handmade and 556 is easy to craft. I usually have like 20k rounds on me, so I dont feel like I'm wasting rounds
---
I run a bloodied stealth commando with a ffr lvc fixer. I really like the fact that I can stay far away from enemies. With melee you are up close and personal. I rarely die, but with I do it’s being swarmed by ghouls....
---
Maybe in the weeks between runs if we're lucky but otherwise that's a thing of the past. 
---
Most people wanted to have more items and cosmetics they could unlock without spending Atoms, so they changed to the score system as well. 
---
Anyone who thought they were going to give free items and still a ton of free atoms set their expectations way out of reach.
---
They only confirmed work around is joining someone else’s FO1st private server and complete it on there. There are several anecdotal work around a that you can search for on the sub and try out yourself
---
Probably around 15k I'd it's 50 crit damage and not limb.
---
They do love to saw dem PipBoys.
---
I'd assume it's less about one shotting things, and more about dps. Mainly regarding tanky-er enemies, but even then, I feel like it's just splitting hairs at that point.
---
That would be awesome.we should be able to take and utilize anything in the game.same with boarded up houses.as if i wouldn't make a badass compound armed to the teeth fabricating from everything around me.
---
I like to wander around the forest collecting foodstuffs armed with nothing more than a 10mm.  
---
Now I'm going to need to be in PA with all my heavy weapons?
---
Thomas had never seen such bullshit before.
---
The only thing i pray that Bethesda would/could ever fix is the crash error CE-34878-0. If that's wasn't a issue and gone forever I would literally buy everything in the atom shop and creation club.
---
Yeah I found a legendary chicken once it was less than a after the “full” game was released
---
Their engine can't handle having a landscape with multiple instances.  It only works for separately loaded spaces.
---
Not worth the risk to keep.
---
Only surefire way is to move your camp.
---
Yeah I'll stick with nukacrypt
---
I would love to, but there's no synth uniforms...lol
---
To tame it has to be a singular spawn (ie alone) only in one of a few specific spots. The current method is to server hop and hit a set route of spawns and hope for luck.
---
Maybe we will see their plans change when next gen consoles come out. You never know, those next gen consoles are kick ass dude.
---
Guess it’s side quests for me until then. Was looking forward to knocking a lot of main story out this weekend.
---
The fact that they haven't lowered it, like they did with concrete, blows my mind.
---
I absolutely hated how this whole levelling works in ESO, and quite frankly I'm afraid this might kill FO76 for me. Surely, getting something from alpha wolves will make me hate that even less when grinding legendary kills, but i already see how ridiculous events are going to look like with pipe guns inflicting more damage on the SBQ than my gatling and shit, levelling up will feel like a complete waste of time now. Why the fuck did grind so much and get so much stronger if mongrels are going to gut me now?
---
My game keeps randomly crashing so much it was unplayable for 2 days. Which was upsetting. And then a major and I mean major frame rate drop at line in the sand. The sand I understand but it never happened before. The crashing though, it crashed 30x in 9 minutes.
---
Free states would be sweet.
---
Despite Bethesda's garbage support team, they will more than likely give you a refund.
---
Could be that the shop is a bit buggy lately as I lost access to wallpapers I definitely had purchased (as in they just disappeared from my camp wallpaper list) and have gained a few wallpapers I definitely did not purchase.
---
Oh man. Salt. Perfect! You have to find it, you can't make or mine it.
---
I love this idea. I hate having to use a perk card for this, and it doesn't work if it's not physically on you, so the Good With Salt doesn't help the vending problem.
---
But having a special recipe with salt? Hell yes! 
---
Make this it's own thread so maybe Beth can see it?
---
BoS is medieval.  Hating them goes back to the Renaissance.  Knight says common man can't have gun and wants his serfs to feed him and give him goods for the privledge of living.
---
There better be new meat week rewards
---
I wish they'd take time to work on the glitches as a priority but idk if this game could survive such a long period without content, I got the game about 3 weeks ago and I've basically done everything besides grind for all of the gold bullion stuff (wtf is with the prices)
---
yeah honestly. this fallout is so fu*king bad like they should actually be ashamed
---
The hoarding didn't really pick up until at least another 50 years from where we are in game.
---
That answers none of my questions.
---
Also Modus can't launch the nukes, he is still not anywhere near trustworthy to any extent, but; he, the brotherhood, and the overseer confirm that only the nuke can draw out the mind control plague bats.
---
Better rewards and slightly less grinding and need to log in every damn day.
---
it would have to be an all purpose item, im not going to salt my tea lol.
---
Yes. Thankfully.
---
I played it right at launch and quit quickly and came back after Wastelanders. Complete difference. I have tons of fun with the game
---
I am not confirming or denying the above statement...
---
PAIGE NO
---
I am very much enjoying the actually gameplay. Just super buggy even by Bethesda standards.
---
Ah yes, cheating or put multiple hours in the game every day every week. The only two options.
---
I agree with you for the most part. But the way I see it as well while everyone is doing their own thing they are keeping the scorched  at bay (to a degree). At the time they are taking whatever they need to survive and still hang on to the hope of a victory. Doesn't help the Responders get wiped out by the Raiders at Charleston. Scorched breaking through BoS. Vault dwellers only really win because alot of the grunt work was already done by the other factions.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
P.s. I've only gotten to the point where I need to register for the BoS in the Campaign. Played the first month the game dropped then quit shortly after due to all the issues back then. So as I finish the story my opinion my change however.
---
I think the problem is the numbers they can see probably show how much total of each junk item exists in all stash across all players and I'm sure there's enough there but some of the accounts may be inactive or possibly could even be showing numbers including suspended but not yet deleted accounts that may have been exploiting. 
---
So there's probably a lot more cork out there than we might realize but yeah, as far as my own stockpile was concerned I tossed about 500 out of the 1500 or so I had in the box so guess we'll see. 
---
Lots of people end up with it from scrapping pipe weapons or golf balls so at least it is easier to farm.
---
I didn't say most players, I the players I play with.  These recommendations aren't anywhere close to high enough to give hardcore players any type of content.
---
Thanks for the help I just found it as well
---
Salt for meat and vegetables? Sugar for tea and fruit?
---
Thick Chick
---
No level up daily for love of Todd. Just make it a complete a ally daily.
---
Ah, then you haven’t learned enough about what’s happened out there then if you’re only that far in.
---
You need to know how to make the Prime receiver for the Gauss Rifle to make Ultracite 2mm
---
RR has tons of hazmat suits laying around, and if you mean One Violent Night by OVN they could just play the instruments. It's going to look goofy as shit with leather armor, pipe gun peeps coming to kill the SBQ and actually doing it
---
I never said I didn't have an int build.  I said I didn't us the various stacked xp buffs.  Yes I have full unyielding and 15 int.  If you want to level for legendary perks then xp is what you need.  You know what you need to grind it, so you're just trying to get them to do the grind for you by making it easier.  As I said the game will have no content for yet another patch for a huge number of players who spend an immense amount of time playing and advocating for this game.  I'd be willing to bet those long term players are even some of the ones who spend the most on the game.  But you know just leave them all out in the cold and ignore them with a system that will literally be done on day one.
---
Lol it was such an in-depth explanation I thought that was a reddit appropriate response
---
Shitty grinding is not an incentive for long term play, and I say this as person with a 600+ character.
---
I had something similar except in the bethesda store where I ordered a pipboy 2000 model kit and for some reason they sent me 2
---
Having multiple items purchased seems more like some intentional act and not a random bug or accident. 
---
You can try to contact support and they can likely either get you a refund or maybe transaction records.
---
What platform are you on? This seems to occur when someone on the same server had recently don't the quest, if you're on xbox I can invite you to my private server do you can finish the quest
---
Animal friend
---
I wouldn't increase the amount of XP needed as levels go on.
---
Also i wouldn't bundle items like at the end of the board. I'd space them out so you're getting cool rewards more often.
---
As was mine!
---
Oh
---
The BoS are Techno-Nazis.
---
Thank you for typing this up. You make valid points and I enjoyed your read. Seriously thank you. We need more discussions like this.
---
You learn the mods by scrapping tesla rifles.
---
Members needs new habitats - MODUS
---
I'd enjoy a feature like a fridge or preservative for sales since I usually make sorchbeast mixed stew, deathclaw Wellington, and the mutton roast thing.
---
Clucking Legendary.
---
This. I shouldn't have to grind the fuck out of my 360 or bullshit around with a new toon just to gain a level daily
---
I don’t have a problem with the increasing SCORE per rank, I’ve been progressing steadily but if it was removed we wouldn’t need to play daily. 
---
The bundle makes sense though, at least the black captain Cosmos, SCORE Board and 500 atoms. The Stein could have been thrown somewhere past 50
---
No repair kits and scrap kits.
---
The POINT,
---
Is that you shouldn't NEED AN XP BUILD TO GRIND FOR LEGENDARY PERKS.
---
The major problem here is that a Grind exists AT ALL.
---
The Legendary Perk system should be a complimentary experience for playing the rest of the game, not the major focus of a grind.
---
And I'm sorry you feel jilted for having played so much, but once again, they need to make content for the WHOLE fanbase, not the precious few that dedicate themselves to it like you.
---
Yea, we get enough repair kits doing SBQ
---
That definitely sucks
---
Smoothskins hate us non-feral ghouls.
---
Reaponders till we save them all.
---
I had the giant wall thing happen to me last week. It looked like the wall from Game of Thrones. I tried to get a picture but by the time I got my camera out it went away.
---
Edited to add: I was in the Ash Heap.
---
I use marksman rifle (instigating/explsiveblts/-33%vats) for long distances,fixer for medium and the shottie for close
---
It was a single bundle item, but yeah, im gonna reach out for a refund.
---
Yea, the 3 level ups weekly isn’t that bad but the daily gets annoying
---
Like I said in my reply to the other guy. Multiple sources across games from multiple companies state China plainly shot the nukes first as a panic due to US soldiers breathing down their necks.
---
Must've been solid gold. And it had unlimited gold rounds
---
I am on Xbox and that would be amazing. I’ll pm you
---
I mean, i shouldn't have to be more "creative" because mechanics are overly picky or glitchy
---
Using VATS is your problem. It's broken.
---
my GT is P34K3, shoot me a friend request and a message letting me know you're from reddit and I'll even help you as much as I can with the mission :)
---
that’s definitely a fair point. I really enjoy the storyline of the fallout games i just feel like they screwed this one up a little with the online aspect. it’s an interesting idea and i think an online extra mode would’ve been cool instead of implementing it in the story. i just find it having too many negatives for me. and like you said a lot of bugs happening for many players. idk i feel disappointed cause i know they have the ability to have executed it better. good luck tho with trying to analyze those samples, i’ve already reset my game like 7 times...
---
Same
---
They're giving us booze and explosives as thanks for donating. What could *possibly* go wrong with a group of drunk people and a pile of grenades?
---
They also give stimpaks. Sly devils know what they're doing.
---
I scrapped my regular level 50 combat shotgun for what I thought was upgrading to a 3* with vampire. It was my first 3* that I was actually excited about only because of the idea for vampire. It seems like it was applying to my enemies and I.
---
Yeah it's a bug from playing Nuclear Winter and then going into Adventure mode.
---
Just playing the instruments leaves them vulnerable and without getting xp for kills.  The hazmat suits have a minimum level.
---
LoP is the only event that is really made for noobs.
---
Thats what i thought thanks for your help.
---
As a Chef for the Gourmands, I would *love* this. Like L-O-V-E it. Let me sell fresh. *Fresh*
---
Okay, did I miss something in the main storyline? Why is the Enclave responsible for the scorched? This is like the 5th time that people have said that.
---
Sigh, the 200 million red asylum dresses that you asked for are just too difficult to grind for. I am not even sure what you are planning to build with all those dresses.
---
And so, I was unable to donate. Do I still get the free hat and vodka?
---
GOD BLESS THE FREE STATES
---
Honestly, I think Elsie Taylor would be a good pick. She's got this whole characterization of being an ex-Pitt Guard who's the best marksman in Foundation, but she (and her family) just sits there. Have the option to restore the MoM be available only to players who either sided with the Settlers or broke into the vault on the Raiders side and split the gold three ways, since going with them only to betray them at the end would lead to too much animosity from the Settlers to have her as an option, and fully joining the Raiders would do the same thing.
---
I cashed out at 2500, you are stronger than me. :'(
---
Lol. &lt;3.
---
But, imma gonna avoid yer trap camp if I can.
---
Excellent idea!
---
They just need to add back atom rewards to challenges, and I'd be happy with it.
---
Unfortunately it's unlikely.
---
Lol. Hey, 'All American BBQ' gotta come from somewhere, right?
---
As the prophecy foretold!
---
As a heavy weapons build who runs Bear Arms (90% reduces HW weight) and Ordinance Express (90% explosives weight)... 
---
I carry a lot. Like 3 melee weapons, 10-15 heavy weapons, and a ton of all explosives
---
It’s already ingame as a rare spawn at certain locations when nuked.
---
The event is different.
---
Rewards are better for the 100 than the lower tiers though thats not saying much since you only get a random camp plan and some scrap.
---
Get a rando to kill it. Also the attacks don't damage anything but when the death claw does the stomp effect it does a tiny bit of damage to things around it. I think its aggressive to allys, turrets, scare crows and generators so if you remove those its all good. You can tame a normal death claw and it will be fine but scorched creatures go ape shit
---
Congrats!
---
Its an exploit.
---
Ok thank you
---
No. I’m not trying to talk to you bro.
---
I don't think what you are describing is limited to the FO76 community. This is just human beings in general even outside the internet.
---
The Enclave created nearly every problem we have except radiation. 
---
You do this little cat a disservice by including them.
---
That is a pure lie, met that chicken, he told me he blasted you, lol. \*Dead chickens don't squak\*.
---
&gt; You'll need clean cranberries that you'll only find in certain locations in the bog
---
... or Abernathy Farm in the Forest.  
---
I've relied on Cranberry Relish since about level 20.
---
And Teapot thing, Back on the Beat, Campfire Tales, etc. Those that are too low level for these, wont even bother with events because they'll be still figuring out the game, and will be doing Responder training prolly
---
Hey! Quick caveat: feel free to help them through, that's good karma!  Just let them launch the nuke.  Hell, they might invite you to do it just so they don't have to burn a card.
---
I would build ppls camps for caps.
---
If they didn't like it they could nuke mine.
---
Talk about working to death.
---
Then again, I already do a free service and upgrade pols weapons at my camp if they purchase something for my vendors lol.
---
Us sellers have to be creative in selling our products, I currently made mine a walk-in haunted house to get to the vendors. And god it's amazing.
---
Yes, and we got the world that'd been blasted back by a good thousand years or so. Seems only natural for someone like BoS to appear. NCR is much better alternative, but that wouldn't happen in a near hundred game years.
---
It would be cool to be able to blueprint the entire camp first. Right now I can barely fit one room in a blueprint budget...
---
What I had envisioned in this idea was simular to far cry 3 where you could landscape the land, trees rocks that kind of thing. All the buildings and other structures would be using the current buildable items we have now.
---
They created and released the Scorchbeasts in order to artificially raise the DEFCON level so they could control and launch nukes.
---
First 50 levels, cut out all the fluff and give us cool cosmetics n shit. Also make challenges based on your rank on the board, so it’s balanced for new and old players. Also a score leaderboard for past level 100, where based on your score you get rewards. Like people with an insane amount get an exclusive cosmetic plus all other rewards, the tier below get their own unique cosmetic plus all below, etc etc. And when I say cosmetic i don’t mean a weapon skin, I mean something super cool like being able to look like a ghoul or scorched in the higher tiers, and a few cool but not as unique cosmetics like a unique collectron related to the specific event
---
i’m a fan of the Free States because AFAIK, they’re pretty unique and it would be cool to see and actual Military and civilization in the Mire and surrounding areas. The BoS is just sort of... there. They’re organized more like Gunners or Mercenaries in that they just do defense and don’t care for setting up civilian towns
---
I hope they do something with the Enclave and the communists that are still around.
---
Ohhhhhhh. Was that in the terminals? I completely goofed and missed that somehow. Either way, thank you for letting me know.
---
Worth
---
and that's a good thing because...?
---
There *is*, however, multiple sources citing the BoS as little more than a more polite raider gang who wouldn't openly fire upon people, but would go out of their way to strongarm your supplies under the pretense of "protecting Appalachia", especially during the later period of the Scorched Steel War, and there is talk of them hoarding vital tech from the Free States and Enclave, though not as much as other chapters. Whether or not what we learn in the BoS questline would influence our characters enough to see past what the other factions had said depends on the character.
---
“bithisdi” i like that
---
Yeah would have meant more cool rewards along the way to make the progress more fun.
---
I played for so long even after wave after wave of people leaving. The Wastelander grind and multiple duplication exploits and shitty updates by the devs made me realize what a waste of time this game is to me. Good for you though, keep eating shit
---
i don’t know the rules and whatnot of the pts but is gameplay footage allowed to be shared? if so, what’s some of the stuff in the new season
---
Do I have to move my camp again to get this to fix?
---
I would like actual themed cosmetics... chicken coop sure is space theme, Ghillie sure are too, and dont forget the space scrap kits and repair kits ooooo so much space theme
---
I know my gauss is an instigating 3 star. No idea what the other two stars are. Headshots are amazing with it. VATS heatshot crits are insane, but if I'm using VATS with it, I'm probably experiencing a brown pants moment.
---
My lever is a furious 3 star. Again, don't remember what the other two stars are. The furious effect will carry over to other targets, I didn't think it was supposed to work like that. I don't have adrenaline. I've got the mutation that loads real fast, and maybe thats one of the other stars. Point being, I can maintain the furious effect until I exhaust my ammo supply. It tops out at 1.1K per headshot on lvl 68 enemies.
---
This is just a brag... but the Fixer is 3 star too. All I remember is it has reduced weight. I don't remember what the other stars are. 
---
I really should catalog my arsenal.
---
Aw really? How? Xbox if it matters
---
BEEF JERKY ! MUTFRUIT RAISINS ! POTATO CHIPS ! THE POSSIBILITIES ARE LIMITLESS
---
What are the other options?
---
I'm retired so it's Fallout76 and a jug of $3 wine for me.    
---
Living the dream.
---
You don’t have to like them, but they have the training and knowledge to help cleanse the scorched. It’s for the good of Appalachia!
---
Who knows, maybe they’ll have a better plan than to just nuke everything again
---
we will find out in 13 hours. PTS isn't live yet
---
So you take the items that are cheap so lower levels can get them and then resell them at a higher price?
---
ok thank you, it’s just that i can’t play pts bc i’m GamePass for PC
---
Literally just replace your melee perks with shotgun perks, get covert operative and you’re good to go, unyielding does the rest of the work for AP, Stealth, Crits, and Accuracy
---
That would only apply to placing things on the ground, and even then only on flat areas where clipping wouldn't be an issue.  To place something similar on walls would require an entirely different system where rather than placing the splatter/grime/etc as an object you would have to apply the texture itself to the walls in order to evenly apply over the contours of their models rather than just being propped up against them, otherwise when you're talking about uneven walls like brick and contemporary you'd end up with parts that clip and parts that float.
---
No. Youre not going to toxify my post. Begone
---
That's the raider collectron
---
What are you taking about, I asked a simple question to clarify your post
---
Idk but I do admit with the guy above me about the toning it down a little with the amount because it's a lot and almost nobody has cork I'd say the hard one was concrete I hated the concrete
---
Nice, thank u, r they worth it and can u set ammo type?
---
Isn’t that why they have recon rifles tho?
---
I’d actually love to do that. If we don’t get proper settlements let’s make our own with camps.
---
*feature
---
I actually enjoy it
---
Esp. since most repeatedable daily quests can be done at any time, score system is purely on a "Do now or else" basis. Meaning you can't get legendary run rewards later, then you feel pressured  to spend money you don't have to get the items you want since they are not in cash shop. It's not even easy to spend the money in other words there is no alternative.
---
Weekly limit would be in line with what most MMO's do anyways.
---
Alright, thanks. He's doing that stomp rapid fire all the time, so I guess I'll have to find a soul to take him out.
---
check for any character/world/social challenges you can grind out. otherwise, gotta pay for em.
---
Man, apparently I'm that guy tonight.  Crops planted at your CAMP will need a like-for-like replacement before your can "fix all".  As a whiskey farmer, I would need to stock a couple dozen of a depletable resource "just in case".  That means holding on to crops I should be turning into caps.
---
Just a heads up.
---
Lots of lifetime challenges to do. 400 should be no problem.
---
you cannot set the ammo type but if you dump it into the ammo converter from the legendary run it doesnt really matter. whether or not its worth it is up to you.
---
for what its worth the raider collectron can also be set to collect chems.
---
no :-/
---
Fun fact. It shites gold and births golden bars twice a day
---
Correct
---
you dont wanna know how. it takes up your camp budget even after you delete it.
---
Yes, it is necessary.  It's the same reason camp build limits exist, to cut down on the likely number of objects present at a time in order to reduce the strain on the servers and more importantly the strain on peoples systems to render everything.  The closer you're allowed to build camps the more likely you are to have too much needing to be loaded/rendered at once.

---
Right but I don’t care about the people you play with especially if they’re hard-core players because the majority of people have lives and can only fit in an hour or two of gaming at most and are not hard-core.
---
I already do that. That’s why I said I’m an unarmed or shotgun bloodied build. My question was about commando.
---
Logically I think one of the factions should take over a pre-existing town like Morgantown or Watoga I mean they're large empty places with relatively easy to kill enemies, basically the entire forest region could and should be repopulated with humans the Ohio river protects it from the west, the ash heap protects it from the south, the savage divide protects it from the East, and the toxic valley protects it from the north. We should be seeing a fully functioning government instated in Morgantown flatwoods Charleston point pleasant Sutton Helvetia (possibly Monogah too). Personally I'd start with Morgantown as its full of low level ghouls, take the dam and you got power, take the food factory and you got food, then work your way inward taking all the buildings until you got a full fledge pre war city
---
Yeah, was a glitched one
---
plus MODUS killed all the actual enclave. right now there isnt an enclave in appalachia. it's just MODUS and his pre-war assets, that happen to have Enclave branding.
---
I honestly didn’t even think about this lol, good point
---
You can always tell a well run town by the quality of its plumbing! And yours is pure shit.
---
*gives a smug high five to Insult-Bot*
---
Doubt they will

Let us earn more score through Nuclear Winter. I don't like feeling forced to go plant vegetables or hunt for a bobblehead for an hour.
---
I don’t think that’s true... I’ve had 1,000 script and when I earned more I had a message of Max Script. 
---
Also, I have 1st.
---
My camp is always 2x2 and i get this bug, so it's not the size.
---
If they're selling at the suggested prices for product at their vendors (outside of the forest), I'll sit for a few seconds before I leave to make sure their perimeter fence required the full 3 wood to replace.
---
22 caps for Gauss ammo?  Hope you got wood scraps.
---
Reddit was made for trolling even though it's against most rules sub wise, most ppl on here don't want others to succeed at making a valid point or suggestion...these people are addicted to disagreeing and arguing because they don't have real goals or aspirations in life other than enjoying someone else's demise or misery on some level.
---
Still tweaking it, trying to rely less on defense but am experimenting with ironclad vs fireproof and life giver. I like using berry mentats so I use chem fiend a lot too. If I’m sitting on a lot of brain bombs or cranberry relish I may swap out reaper for good with salt.
---
My bloodied gauss shotgun hovers between 900-1000 damage here if I keep my health in in the 10-20% range (bloodied powerfist 800-900). The unyielding maxes out here so that’s plus 15 to each special stat too. I like to do long excursions with lots of looting so I try to start out with 200+ lbs of available carry weight (this keeps me in the 400ish range of total carry capacity but can flex up to mid 500s with food perks while on a team). I forgot to check but my DR and ER is usually 550-650 range with this build in a full set of SS armor.
---
Add cumulative, hardcore challenges.
---
This is the first time I’ve seen someone want more Nuclear Winter challenges instead of less

I’m with the enclave, but I was able to work in in my mind that my character is helping them just to spy on them and see what they’re up to (and what wastelander wouldn’t want the extra supplies you get for helping?)
---
The best part is that it's not one short event, it's usually two. I guess people will be all over the place once One Appalachia hits the servers...
---
lol 15k is what i listed it for originally...yes its 50 crit
---
I dressed Gramps in a plague doctor mask, black prospector's hat and the fashionable raider outfit. He's looking pretty good I think.
---
If you grab all the super mutant prices, toxic goo, and put it in a display case in a radstorm, and shoot it with a Tesla, you spawn a super mutant Frankenstein's monster lol.
---
I just think they should use the new factions they made instead of cramming the BOS in, I’m tired of them after the my being in every game. It would be cool to expand on responders or free states lore.
---
Would be a nice gesture if it was more consensual
---
I haven’t seen a legendary critter since launch
---
Oh, my bad. It’s an unpopular opinion, but for rifles don’t go auto unless you’re ready to constantly grind for ammo. I find a lever action, .50 hunting rifle and an explosive handmade are all you need(all bloodied)They cover you on long range, mid range and short range, as well as being ammo efficient. Using VATS is the best way to do auto rifles though.
---
It’s a glitch. The prime receivers for the Bullion Weapons *should* teach you their ammo types, but they don’t.
---
At least that’s my opinion on it. Bethesda hasn’t said a word.
---
That's actually a fair point I had not considered.
---
However, I hope you'll accept a rebuttal - they're giving us instanced interiors soon, presumably with a seperate budget.  I'd be willing to trade off a smaller exterior budget in order to be allowed to build closer together.
---
A smaller exterior budget would help solve the problem of how much needs to be rendered at once, right?
---
Well how was I supposed to know?
---
Everyone's buying gold anways since you can keep buying from him right now, so not many want to spend caps
---
Did they fix his quests? I got the Raider Punk at the moment.

---
Generic bloodied template. Just add your weapon perks and have fun!
---
I never had the armor, and the 1 time I saw in person (pre nerf) my game crashed.
---
But did the effect also jump from infected entities to the ones around them in a chain effect?
---
Funny enough I’ve never even attempted...on my list for tonight!
---
Yes. That’s why I did a bloodied snipe. Figured easier on the ammo and all.
---
The Legendary Run is already a huge turn off to most players. It became too tedious before we even finished the first season. People are just tired of all the Grind on top of Gring on top of Grind's whole concept!
---
\*Starts re-branding my BoS themed character's camp.\*
---
Those got nerfed. They exist but they got nerfed.
---
Also: Workshops are PvP zones, not farming zones.
---
I don't get why anyone would want less ways to earn score. I don't want to take away adventure mode challenges, I just want more NW challenges.
---
That feel when Legendary Attribute perk cards are better than the actual legendary perks because you can atleast use those 5 points when maxed out for more powerful, and actually useful - normal perks.
---
Chems are by far the best choice. They weigh almost nothing, sell for lots of caps and some of them are very useful. I've amassed a huge stockpile of Berry Mentats because of that collectron.
---
Ad Victoriam. I hope that there's a Cleanse Appalachia daily.
---
I hate the burrows. Always get lost.
---
I know but that's only if the other player decides to take over my workshop. I was there and he decided to roll up and take it over for scrap. And because mount Blair is able to be powered up, it collects ore scrap
---
never accept random team invites. most of the time they're just looking for people to fuck with.
---
And since the gauss shotgun does explosive damage sometimes I take off skeet shooter when clearing hordes or clearing spots quickly because the wider spread can get you multiple kills with a single shot.
---
Sounds like you would much prefer to play a different game than the one you're being given.  Maybe its time to play something else instead of the gameloops that have been provided in this game.  Not all games are designed to be fun to every player.  Sorry you're not finding it fun.
---
I doubt it'll work in 76 but what I used to do in 4 to make settlers wear it is put the frame down near them and wait till your camp is attacked if your in a location where it happens
---
They didn't get nerfed, they just got removed from loot pools aka can't drop anymore (legit). The reason they are OP is just because of that they didn't nerf them. While other explosive weapons did get nerfed from 100% to 20%.
---
Then you need to buy FO1st and stick to private servers if you're going to complain about multiple players being in your MMORPG.
---
I think he's still broken, but I never remembered to do his quest anyway even when it worked. I just like having the guy around.
---
Be thankful of handouts from higher level players, but don't get greedy and start demanding more/better stuff.
---
It probably is a glitch. Shockingly i have every prime ammo plan except that one. I just bought it to prime it for extra damage since I’m sitting on a bunch of gold. iv bought everything i want except maybe the new power armor but i love my x-01 too much to switch.
---
Range. And with a good build, you can often down enemies with 1 bullet as well... but you can dump 25 bullets in 3 seconds if you need to. 
---
I run a bloodied rifleman build but I’m on PC and have all the perks for commando too, I use mods to switch depending on the situation. Generally in solo PvE I run Rifleman, but for bosses I convert to Commando. As a rifleman, I’ve cleared both lanes of Guided Meditation with 5-8 ghoul spawns per side by myself. You literally cannot do that as a shot gunner or a melee. 
---
I could do it as a commando but I’d lose the 1shot capability at the ranges I’d be firing at.
---
I guess my build is full secret service armor with blocker perk.  I have 4 endurance and regularly run with about 10% hp.  It takes prob 3-4 hits and Serendipity has a good chance of kicking in.  The problem with the super mutants is every once in awhile 1 super mutant will have a stronger than normal assault rifle that just tears me apart, usually doesn't kill but almost does sometimes.
---
It's really nice of you, but honestly? Just tell them to "git gud" and let them create a build of their own. It would be boring to see everyone running around with the same build all the time \*looks at bloodied\*. Just my opinion
---
True
---
Turrets
---
No brakes on the grind train! You must play 5 hours every day or you will never be able to complete all our amazing seasonal content! /s
---
Honestly if this was for a responders like organization that requested medical supplies or chems I'd be all over it.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d6533ce&amp;d=su2so2sp2sd2p02pc2ej4ic2a72as2lr2l12lt2lv0l71lu1c62s00a04a30&amp;m=51c9fb&amp;n=Shotgun%20VATS
---
IMO This would work better. Adrenaline works better than gun fu because you can use it outside VATS and ends up with the same effect, but also cam combo with Gun fu for +70% damage once you get the max adrenaline bonus. Also mutations are insanely good because of public teams, because even if you don’t need one for 2 lck you can get a +2 bonus to all special stats
---
Cool then we don't care about you either.  We will continue to push the boundaries of their game in every way possible.  It's fun for me, its fun for literally thousands and thousands of other players, sorry it seems like this fun offends you so much.  You have my sympathy that you aren't able to find enjoyment in a game like this.
---
Yea they said its suppose to be in patch 22 last week lol
---
What do you price your stuff?
---
My Dude, it sounds like YOU'RE not having fun.
---
That happens to me, but my only problem is with the fcking ghouls, im in the air 2 seconds(usually) before they get near me and they still bend time and space to fcking hit me
---
It does suck, so what is implemented is having multiple character slots. What sucks about starting a new toon is having to go through all the beginner stuff and missions again... and again... 
---
I was running one toon for a while. Commando (currently level 360). Decided I wanted to do a shotgun build when Wastelanders dropped because gauss shotgun. Started a new toon for that. Leveled him fairly quickly from the start of Wastelanders to now he’s at level 200. Got a little bored with him, and remembered one of my mules has a ton of bloodied explosive heavy guns.
---
So I waited for the public team system to go live. Leveled up a new toon through all that mess again. From the day public teams went live to now he’s already at 150. Now I’m on the cusp of doing another new toon because leveling is so quick and easy now (thinking grenadier/one handed melee). 
---
Unfortunately they made it really hard to just change your build and play style by only using one character. You’re almost pigeon holed into having to create multiple characters if you want to try something different. Just now with public teams bonuses it’s a lot quicker than it used to be. Even my higher level character can gain one or two levels in under an hour.
---
What is this?
---
Don’t care didn’t ask plus you’re cringe
---
I'm just saying, maybe trade for better gear instead of whining about losing on reddit. They traded for those guns, and let me tell ya, they aren't the worst guns out there. There's lots of hacked weapons that will never get taken out of the Game, so good luck convincing them to take out legitimately found weapons lmao. I don't think he needed your scrap bro, I think he did it just to kill you for luls. might wanna shelf your pipedreams and avoid workshops unless ya wanna become a skid mark on the workshop floor.
---
If i remember right, there are a few main members of The Free States that fits the "if you don't see the body, they aren't dead" trope so i'm really waiting/hoping they do show up again. Say Abbie, pretty sure we never see her body and i just want to give her a hug.
---
But yeah, not supporting the BoS is far more what my character would do after reading about their fall from grace (like forcibly taking thunder mountain power planet from the Free State).
---
That'll be the day I stop playing, if they took weapons from me that I legitimately earned, my main weapons, they wouldn't get another penny from me and not another second of my time.
---
I have 11 lmgs, 3 .50cals, 6 Gatling lasers, 3 gatlings, a Gauss Gatling, about 12 miniguns, 5 Gatling Plasmas, a few flamers, cryolators, various melee weapons, every grenade I can pick up, and scrip.  2 sets of armor and approximately a million rounds.  Not overencumbered.
---
Yeah. :(
---
You killed the golden goose
---
Datamined spreadsheet containing info on how to get every plan in game, and the exact % chances to drop/learn/etc.
---
Commie whackers, plus do the thing kids have to do before soccer games and everyone gets a free whack.
---
I like that's its a perk and that it costs 9 points. It forces those people to forego most of other good agi perks like action boy or marathoner so they can't ruin away as easily.
---
Personally, I opt for goat legs, and usually start the Morgantown map up in the hills on the east side. Being able to simply run and jump off a cliff without fear of dying is a lot better than having to pick and choose your path.
---
Exactly. They won't take NW weapons out of adventure mode. They sure as hell aren't removing legitimate legendaries.
---
Boooo
---
Cool, thank you
---
No
---
"COME ON DOWN TO BIG AL'S DISCOUNT BUNKER BARN!  SURE, YOU CAN HEAR YOUR NEIGHBOR TALK WHEN YOU'RE UNDERGROUND, BUT YOU'RE SAFE FROM WHAT'S UP THERE!"
---
I play one character. I switched to an intelligence build and unyielding , +exp buffs for the legendary run repeatable score challenge . Since doing that I have lvl 80 times . Lvl 310-390.  That’s since it started . I played casually since the game came out. To get to 312 , it’s quite possible to hit the goals required to have a full legendary perk system. If you want to get there then maximize your build for lvling for a little bit. It’s been refreshing playing with a different build .
---
If only Bethesda gave a shit what it’s fans think. 🤭
---
Probably because NW is an unpopular mode. Personally I don’t do those challenges most of the time because I find NW just that unenjoyable.
---
Double score will help
---
It'll be interesting to see how 'One Appalachia' changes this event. At the moment the wolves are level 5 and they drop level 1-5 loot, but after the next big update the wolves will probably be max level (for high level players) and drop level 45-50 legendaries.
---
Most definitely. When I'm far away and I hear gunshots in the direction of my CAMP, I know someone is shooting my Brahmin.
---
It’s so we can flex on players in the future. It’s like the mountain scout uniform.
---
While I get your beef, you wouldn't stand up against a gauss mini gun or shotgun in the pvp zone anyhow. I wouldn't worry about weapons you can't get anymore, as much as I'd worry about every other weapon that can do the same damage as a tse laser  that can be obtained by any player
---
KFC’s new spokesperson.
---
Well there goes the neighborhood with all the Chinese Stealth Suits and liberators running around 🤣🤣
---
Yeah exactly. Striping someone of their gear would be downright wrong. If it was obtained legitimately, then they shouldn't be punished
---
Even beyond the system limits your idea of having camps closer together would cause more headaches than anything.  Sure it's a great idea for small groups of friends who want to build closer to one another in a coordinated manner but what about everyone else?  Not everyone wants to load into the game and find out that their front yard is now someone else's back yard.  
---
And no, cutting build budgets wouldn't work because once they actually start encouraging people to build next to each other it's not just going to be a matter of two camps close together but possibly three or more.  Then even outside of "towns" purposefully built close together there's no telling how many camps you could end up crammed in next to each in popular spots built by players with no relation.  Popular areas like Whitesprings could just end up a block of four or five camps next to each other.
---
Right, this is pretty much core to the issue I’m having, in that I don’t want to have to start from scratch every time I want to pivot my build style and lose all the effort I put into a given toon just to do so...and definitely not want to replay some of the monotonous quests over and over again just to get access to all the end game features for that toon.
---
I just sell them to the vendor robots with hard bargain 3 to help get the daily 1400 caps.
---
yall done downvoted me asking about steeldawn when on stream they said its next patch &gt;:c. They gotta be hiding it
---
The new quack outfit hides your rocket pack but not the backpack.
---
Same thing happened to me.  Just keep trying! It took me two days and several server hops but it finally completed.
---
It's bugged. They're fixing it in the [update](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/72tNixuDqBoHEVDsI3Dc29/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pts-a-colossal-problem-and-meat-week-begin-soon) on Tuesday.
---
Hmm, challenges can be glitchy. I've had no trouble with the daily ones but with character and world challenges,I've seen some problems. Seems when I track them, though,  it resolves the issue.
---
cause it made ESO huge. Plus tbfh people are one shoting everything anyway.
---
Certain outfits will do this already. Like the Responders Fireman outfit, or the Nuka Girl suit.
---
I’m stuck on this too - with two different characters. None of the suggested fixes work. Ugh.
---
Same here
---
And now I understand that random encounter with an NPC running away from a chicken.
---
YOURE willing to trade out a smaller exterior budget. I doubt other people would be willing to do the same, especially people who like having highly decorated camps. They’re not gonna change one thing just because you want it that way
---
Trade money for atoms is quickest.
---
&gt; (Who downvotes this?) 
---
there's a cadre of reddit users who habitually downvote everything because they are perpetually salty at life for not giving them a waifu
---
I’m playing on Xbox. Same exact problem.
---
Been brought up since launch.  Then they gave us what we got.  Still been brought up.
---
The reality is this is the first fallout to have any respec at all.  
---
Making new characters has been what ppl do.
---
It's an exploit that permanently fucks over some of your camp budget.
---
I know! But apparently only your porch can have white paint on the stairs.
---
So how exactly does your own foot taste?  I'm not talking about the idiom referring to someone that says something stupid, I'm assuming you're just the kind of person that gnaws on their own foot when bored, like a dog or something.
---
NO. You can't begin to fathom the unreasonable amount of random, unuseable and trashy perk cards I, and many others, have floating around.
---
Rule 3
---
Again I'm new to the game, I dont know the best areas to farm or anything like that. And I'm always struggling with chaos because I'm trying to buy others things to keep me alive. And it isnt really cool to just roll up on some new low level and insta-kill em. He wanted the scrap that Mount Blair produces during the EarthShaler quest
---
Following because I'm wondering the same thing. I haven't noticed anything coming from the weapons with the medics prefix.
---
Recon is broken, has been since spring last year. They need to fix it first (markers don’t show in normal play field unless you’re like 10 feet away; they used to work out to like 100 feet)
---
Same.
---
It’s not a 1st discount it’s for everyone
---
\*points to Thunder Mountain where they took it by force from The Free States and Taggerdy's "if it ain't already on their land, you can take it even if they are already claiming it" orders for scavenging, among other minor flavor text holotapes\*
---
honestly the deciding fact is if your character believes in the "greater good" argument (which actually holds weight for once with said scorched plague)
---
Still, I wasnt in a pvp zone, it was a workshop I had claimed and was building in, everyone that posts their answer seems to skip over that bit. That he went to go claim the workshop I was already claiming.
---
This either happens when you don’t have any loot dropped or a bug maybe. Sometimes I die and forget I scrapped my junk and search for awhile for it.
---
Hey, I couldn't understand Raider logic, but I still helped them out because it served my goal of getting the heist done and ensuring half of Appalachia's new populace don't become Scorched. I even screwed them over at the end of the main heist by giving half of their half to Foundation, ensuring nobody is truly in power except for the survivors of Vault 76.
---
Nuka rocketsuit only makes it disappear occasionally. Remove then reapply jetpack chest piece, rockets are there
---
Someone may have taken your loot.
---
How do you get this raider collectron?
---
That happens because of the energy weapon glitch. If you kill something with a laser or plasma gun and turn it into an ash or goo pile there's a chance it'll respawn as a naked, unkillable, static enemy.
---
Nah man I had 30+ black titanium and boom it’s all gone
---
Shit thanks. Says like very minimal hours left were they just randomly thrown up for a few hours?
---
How do people benefit from taking away challenges from NW players?
---
The weird thing is that the health bars didn't deplete while they were visible. I would turn away, turn back, and the health would be depleted a smidge. Otherwise, it was just the lack of damage that seemed odd.
---
I won't be able to play again until tomorrow, but I'll definitely test it again then. I was just dumbfounded by this, had to ask.
---
Nobody’s here lol been here for like an hour
---
it’s a common occurrence... the vending machines are even worse.
---
It was in atom shop
---
Welp, there goes me helping out lowbies by tanking high level super mutants for them.
---
If it's the Vox syringer what you are talking about there's no way to get rid if it, except for completing the shoot some animals and protect them quests. After you shoot them all, you replace the syringer in the basement where you turn in the quest. Don't pick it back up again.
---
That actually sucks man sorry. Prob a bug or something
---
Umm No idea then I think the quest is in the misc quests I’m not really sure
---
What the guy said about VATS
---
Yeah that’s what i think too been grinding all day just for one of Bethesda’s bugs to claim my work
---
This should be an instakill ability for SBQ. When she does that lunge attack she should eat someone.
---
no doubt this is very cool, and i would really love it if they have recon lens. but if it means replacing another item, not really
---
I looked and it’s not there so i’m starting to think a bug got it
---
I started with wastlanders. When did that come out?
---
It's pretty cool ngl
---
Yeah that one was in my inventory too. I got rid of it the same way you said. But this ones called roses syringe located by "top of the world" POI. Where this robot is called rose. I think bc of this npc update it got my game all messed up but idk
---
Omg.
---
Workshops. Are. PvP. Zones.
---
It says right before you claim it that it'll open you up to PvP.
---
Long ago... It’s literally the coolest outfit in the game and it was awarded for dealing with the game until it got fixed
---
You're new to the game but you know about TSE weapons.
---
If you have no clue, [fed76.info/pricing](http://fed76.info/pricing) does a good job estimating.
---
But that's if anyone who comes in decides to take it. Once they head up to the workshop and claim it from me while it's under my control
---
"I wasn't in a PvP zone, it was a workshop I had claimed and was building in."
---
Someone needs to make this as a t-shirt slogan for foodbuilds.
---
In FO4 I had a pile of cash on my kitchen table which would sometimes disappear and end up under my house in Sanctuary.
---
Dear Bethesda,  
---
Please nerf paper.  
---
Yours sincerely,  
---
Rock
---
All I know is they are Two Shot Explosive and they are super op. A friend told me so when I went to make some market sales on reddit. Cause I had know idea what any of the terms mean
---
Honestly, I prefer alot more than the daily level up atom challenges. I don't have wear anything, or be well rested. All I gotta do is take a new 7 minute trip to the wayward and craft some stuff at the overseers camp. Boom done.
---
Can confirm. I have maxed out the turrets on my camp (at 10, I think) which basically only leaves me room to slap down a port-a-potty to live in before I’m at capacity with the damn budget.
---
I wonder if all scorched pets are like that. I recently tamed a scorched mirelurk king and all he does is scream at my oil lamp post. Smh 😐
---
Ha ha very funny.
---
I found the quickest fix for stairs that cause that: put a half-floor under them. Seems to magically do the trick.
---
Ass hat
---
Hmm. Well, good luck! Sorry I couldn't be more help.
---
There was a PVP event there when the game first rolled out.  It rewarded Confederate or union uniform hats.  I think.
---
Quite the opposite.  If I land on a team where someone has their mic on I leave it.  Sorry, but having some random person talking out of my TV ruins the game.  Most people don't play with mics unless teamed with actual friends, at least on Xbox.
---
Tell me something I don't know. I'm an evil griefer because I enjoy playing within the parameters Bethesda has given us for PvP.
---
Its fine thank you for trying to help at least
---
LOL I'm having a blast why do you think I'm level 745?  I played at release, quit because I thought the world was empty, now that wastelanders released it was like FO76 part 2 for me.  It's been so much fun.  These seasons are going to be the best thing that happened to the game.  I can't wait to see what One Wasteland brings
---
You have the option to turn off team when entering NW.
---
But yeah, I miss survival mode, ngl.
---
i wouldn’t be that mad, i mean, think of it, it was annoying at first but eventually they doubled the duration and in the end we got more fasnacht
---
That won’t be a problem after perk loadouts. They could also keep the scrap system and have it give different rewards.
---
That makes me feel better as I could never figure out how to make it work. Despite being told it's simple.
---
I'm pretty sure the only mod that's plan only is the napalmer tank.  I could be wrong about that one, but it was the only plan I did not get by scrapping at least so theres that.
---
Wow..... you’re a piece of garbage bud
---
 Try wearing an armor piece that has "15% while blocking".
---
I mean, he's probably not doing the quest. Most high levels have thousands of scrap, they did it to kill you. Like it's not personal, if I see someone at a workshop I hunt them for sport, kill em, store their junk, and continue farming foodbuilds. We call new players foodbuilds because they exist as food for us. Delicious food. Salty food. There are videos on farming runs you can take instead, but assume theres a chance to get griefed at every workshop you take. If you see someone wearing a full marine or secret service set, assume that's me and run.
---
I already do this. One of my characters is a free states guy, the other is BoS.
---
They should really start looking at how ESO does it. They do it much better. Perk cards for a bit then something else takes over like CPs on ESO.
---
I get it but it's not fun just getting instantly killed just because some dude wants the scrap my workshop would soon produce. I was having a hard enough time trying to even get the lead to make the ignition cores, and then he comes in and just blows me away which I wasnt expecting. Like I'm mad, and I get he earned that weapon and all. But still. I'm a nice guy, if someone wants something of mine and I have plenty, I'll give it away. It's just rather bothersome to die by such an op weapon, and I'm standing there in lvl 25 excavator armor like wtf lol
---
I have a bloodied explosive laser rifle and it shreds. Anti armor one too, and a junkies one. Vampires one too for luls. It's not a tse likely, because tse is trash
---
"Assume that's me and run."
---
And he is serious about this. I've got melted by Nekrosias more times than I can count.
---
That's even assuming the game is still alive, right? Friggn' Bethesda!!
---
Hey, at least they didn’t have hacked .50 cals.
---
Plasma grenades annoy me the most because you can't even pick up your loot afterwards.
---
Or maybe they are trying to tank it so people can’t get extra score and be pushed towards spending more atoms/money instead?
---
As someone who hates it when it when there’s limited “good” builds, bloodied is looking very tempting right now.
---
Lmao, I melt myself more than anyone else ever has. I get volunteered for a space program by my own weapons
---
10 Atoms per card :D
---
Ok and that's a bit gruesome that you see us low level/new players as food for whatever devious plans you have. But I was just trying to have fun and play. I forgot to turn on Pacifist mod unless that doesnt so anything.
---
Classic move 🤪
---
Can't expect these foodbuilds to know proper terminology for these weapons.
---
Ah, well whatever is was he killed me instantly, and it wasnt fun
---
Why do you help traitors...member?
---
Excuse me I use a 2 shot fatman thank you very much.
---
Honestly any good end game build can be a real threat, bloodied or junkies and be right there with the energy explosives if played right. You got unlucky that you ran into an unkind player with a highly damaging weapon. I personally have a JE plasma gat, but I don't PVP, I generally use it for clearing trash mobs in events, and switch to a lesser damaging weapon if other players are there when a legendary spawns at one so they can get a hit too. Honestly though if you aren't 50+ with an optimised build, you are probably going to get burnt in any PVP situation, it's the unfortunate side effect of a level based multiplayer game.
---
As far as steps they took against these weapons already, they nerfed the explosive damage from 100% weapon damage to 20% and two shot damage from 100% weapon damage to 25% that the legendary modifiers granted, additionally they nerfed the demolition expert perk card, which at max rank originally granted 100% explosive damage, to 60% at max rank. This was changed in patch 5, quite a long time ago, a lot of this was done because TSE weapons in general were too strong. They also made explosive energy weapons no longer drop from legendary enemies. The ones you are running into are either pre patch or cheated into existence. These weapons were supposed to be returned to the drop tables after being tuned, but this never occured.
---
One thing to keep in mind, while it wouldn't affect my daily game play much, since I don't main one of these energy explosive weapons, but if these weapons were removed entirely from the game this would essentially be a punishment to everyone who legitimately obtained these weapons, and those who don't use them in an asshole manner. It would be unfair to all the players who traded for these weapons or obtained them pre patch 5. This is the reason they will likely never be removed from the game as well.
---
A suggestion for your build, while not fail proof by any means, consider damage mitagation perk cards like serendipity and fireproof. They might not save you, but you might last longer. There are others as well, but I cannot think of them off the top of my head.
---
Edit: removed ricochet, doesn't work in pvp, forgot. Lol
---
Now that is true, given every time we're on a voice call during gameplay, you always start cursing cause you've yeeted yourself into the skybox. Again. I've been witness to many a goomba yeet in my rime.
---
Whats the point of grinding for the armor if skins are available. Don’t get me wrong i would love to see more scout armor skins that just kills incentive to purchase thorn or solar
---
It does turn them all into glowing ones and I do think it's slightly more XP, but the time needed to go through the silo totally wastes the extra xp.  Plus you're better off grinding on public servers, and no guarentee that you'll hop back into the same server unless you're playing with friends.
---
Yeah this is the main reason, aside from the weeks of dailies, that I hate wastelanders. Why not fix the main storyline when we can just tack on a 
---
brand-new one that has nothing to do with the original!
---
Doesn't do anything in workshop zones. And the only plans I have is to harvest salty tears of casuls. I have 3 mule accounts, that's 15 total characters loaded TF down. Endless scrap and supplies. The only thing left to farm is tears and sadness of foodies
---
😂
---
For this event especially glitched one I already prepared a two shot AGL n Missile Launcher, and a Bloodied AGL in case someone spamming 40mm
---
One of us
---
Can I ask, why does anyone want caps over scrip? I’m level 100 have 50k caps even though I spend lavishly, 15k caps more isn’t going to change my experience.
---
The bummer is the scrip limit, but caps aren’t an incentive to carry the extra weight
---
Alienation is a social ill we must strive to fix
---
Thats only for you. Im talking about a version od NW where there are no teams. All 52 plsyers are hostle to each other, every man( or woman) for themselves.
---
Pacifist mode won't prevent workshop PvP. Just saying.
---
95% of my experience with public teams with open mics has been: eating (crunching and slurping noises), talking to their friend sitting on the couch next to them, kids getting reamed out by parents, constant narration of what's happening, or swearing randomly.
---
Nothing quite ruins my engagement in the game like hearing a guy repeatedly yelling, "Suck my dick!" at an unknown entity.
---
I don't think so. I think it is embarrassing, tbh.  
---
Imagine being brand new to the game, a LvL 42, and a LvL 247 rolls up to your workshop. You get **steamrolled**, and are so utterly incapable of accepting the fact that another player is simply better than you that you jump onto social media and make a post saying the particular weapon they used should be nerfed. Imagine being so fragile that you somehow convinced yourself that the difference in playtime, gear, build, and general experience can all be contained within a gun and that it would've made a difference if they had been using a level 1 pipe pistol.. and imagine going to a PVP area and complaining about PVP..
---
Rational arguments should be considered, but butthurt sob-posts are just embarrassing and should be ignored. It's nothing short of pathetic.
---
I have borne witness to the Great Chicken. All hail the Great Chicken.
---
Double agent
---
Exactly, What’s the point of all this backstory and faction lore if none of it comes into play
---
I mean, this is theoretically possible if *everyone* selected "fill team (off)"
---
honestly the spoilage part is so stupid imo. they should make it next to redundant imo and make food spoil in like 6 irl hrs and doesn’t spoil at all in stash boxes. say what you want, *no one* is gonna be desperately holding onto food
---
Pls nerf all guns, no damage only look cool
---
I'm just gonna put it bluntly.  He didnt kill you for your scrap.  He killed you to kill you.  He did it because he thinks pvp is fun, and you claiming a workshop is signaling that you are available to pvp.
---
Or he killed you because he could and he enjoys that it pisses you off.  That he was able to set you back.  This is the part he might enjoy. There is no winning against that person.  Best to pack up and leave.  The longer you stay is the more enjoyment and power you give them.
---
In fo3 I dropped all my pre war money on the bed so when I rested I sleep in it. The frame rate drop was well worth the pile
---
Yeah I get that. It rattles their cages which seems to be helpful. That was the intent but it seems to be doing more harm than good.
---
As for the rest I'd like to see options to side with BoS, Enclave, and the Reponders are just kinda sad. Mostly I just wanna see more faction choice. Even in fo4 it had the option of choosing Ins or BoS.
---
Maybe like on the PTS where nukes periodically hit monongah mine so you don’t actually have to launch nukes to fight the colossus?
---
I assume you checked your junk tab, if you're in an event, you don't drop junk.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
I know! Another thing is what’s the point of having us go through all the trouble of joining all these dead factions if they’re just going to stay dead?
---
This is why is usually just go in with a melee, they can't say I'm op, they are just bad.
---
I do believe the wiki is wrong. Backpacks only reduce by about 60%, unsure about refrigerator but the main problem with those is limited slow and high camp cost.
---
Bank alt and/or good with salt is your best bet.
---
I'll have to look into that. Sounds like a nice piece of lore I've looked over.
---
That mutated creature is not of the water fowl family.
---
Damn... I could not have said it better
---
Bitch I'm the fucking president until further notice.
---
Fite me
---
PS I only just found out. Don't be mad.
---
I use a low damage explosive weapon with grenadier. It saves ammo anyways
---
Cyberpunk got pushed to Nov 19. In Oct I have Crash 4 and Watch Dogs 3. In Nov I have Valhalla and Cyberpunk.
---
They are working on perk load-outs
---
Wait, flamingos take a lot of budget? Huh. Guess I have some redecorating to do.
---
To be fair, there are people that actually like NW and I don't think they should lose their daily.  It's a good way to get people to try out the mode.  I never played NW until the season started, but got all the Halloween and Holiday rewards via some glitch.  Ghillie Suit too.  It was worth it to me to grind those out even though I don't particularly enjoy the mode.  Today's survive for 15 minutes forced me to actually play; and by play I mean hide in a bush and somehow end up in 3rd place after being killed by a Grafton Monster.  Guess I should have looked for a gun or something, but oh well, got my 250 score and more importantly DIDN'T level up in NW in case tomorrow's is level up.
---
Is there a good spawn point to find chickens you can tame? My pet Rabbit, Hopps, got killed by a Mothman.
---
If you're around level 72-76, you're gonna be fine. After double score. Really hope this bug doesn't get you again.

I found a legendary runaway raider the other day while doing the Retirement Plan quest for Rocksy.
---
Ah ok
---
I read that you can complete it in a private world. See if someone will let you join them if you don't have f1st.
---
In a workshop, pacifist does nothing.  You can kill and be killed in a workshop. 
---
In workshops, pvp is always enabled.  They can take it from you or just role up.  Thems the rules and they are layed out from the get go.  Not only that, but workshops aren't worth fighting over.
---
Amazing what a google search could do in terms of finding answers for simple questions...
---
As the team doesn't affect your personal result, it really should be a free for all. Team mode should be team result.
---
No I even wrote him of why he did it. He wanted the scrap that can be dug up at Mount Blair. He didnt say anything else.
---
I just do a quick circle with my explosive .50 cal and grenadier. Paints enough damage to count, but if I somehow actually kill anything I'd be surprised.
---
I’m bloodied so I may kill something. Not sure
---
omg! it takes me about a full minute to make 12 soups.

It's not bad when it's just hitting them but when 2 shots blows the whole mob instantly it's just gggrrrr

I did and i wasn’t in an event I hope I think a bug got to it might’ve not shown up in markers or fell through the map idek at this point
---
I could see it being a bit of a challenge to have the ! Perks actually be active from that slot and possible bugs with having perks in that spot when you stop using the ! legenday perk, but in large it's just adding an extra parameter that should be easy to catch most bugs in base playtesting once the code is finished.
---
Probably wearing the chinese stealth armor. It gives 1000 radiation resistant and has some damage resistant as well
---
Nope. It just got nerfed into oblivion. My electrically charged mutation is more effective at shrugging off attackers than the power-armor
---
I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I tap a workshop, kill them hilariously, hide in the woods and let them have it back, they think they are safe and go back in, then I tap it again to murder them. I've been able to do this up to 5x
---
Holy shit, you think people aren't being negative _enough_???? You think this community is _overly_ positive??? Where the fuck were you when Update 21 dropped? When the Legendary Run started and everyone started complaining that the goals were impossible unless you spent money? When Fasnacht got delayed because of a bug? When displays got shut down for _weeks_ to root out duping glitches?
---
I'm 73, retired and have been playing F76 since the original beta test. I've played it on the XBox One, PS4 and the PC. On XBox I'm at level 149 as of today. Could  be higher except for diluting my playing time across 3 platforms. Sure, there are things I'd like to be different on the game, but on balance I'm still enjoying it. I liked F04. 
---
I am paying for 1St on XBox with no apologies to anyone. The plain fact is that I much prefer playing in the Private World with its bottomless scrap box, the survivor tent and extra Atoms each month. The payment is certainly less than any single cable or streaming feature. 
---
I really don't like PVP games at all. My experience has been too many contacts with griefers and cheaters. The last time I had contact as such with another player in this game it was while trying to help a very low level (&lt;10) Wanted who ended up absorbing what should have been a one-shot kill at his level while running tight circles around me and taking me down as fast as a 200+ player might. I then learned that was some kind of exploit and a trap. Players like that tick me off much worse than anything else about this game.
---
I finished the Legendary Run 1 a couple of weeks back and now I'm just doing some quests I skipped early on. It was a real grind for not much. Now I know. If Season 2 looks similar at all then I'll simply ignore it. NO ONE really cares whether or not I (or you) play any aspect of this or any other game. Same with the BoS stuff. After looking at the steel challenge it just isn't worth my time to mess with it when I still have other things to do. The key point is that there's absolutely no reason that I can see for me to be upset that those things exist in the game. My lack of interest in them has absolutely NO relevance to anyone else's interest in playing through them. If YOU like those things then please just enjoy the experience. If not then move on with aspects of the game you do like. Or not. 
---
There are bugs in the game, sure. The people who harp on the bugs and insult the programmers who have obviously put many many hours into this game just reveal how little they know about programming. After 42 years as a computer programmer I can tell you with certainty that there has never been a bug free program. In the early days of mainframe OS's Big Blue had a 1-instruction program. It had a design flaw and then a fix (patch). Other programmers from that time probably can tell you the name of the program right off the top of their heads too. And there never will be bug free programs. It's the nature of the beast. Games such as this have MASSIVE amounts of code. Believe that people are working on the bugs in this game and others are constantly coming up with new code under crushing deadlines.
---
When I inevitably reach that point in playing F76 where there just isn't enough un-played content that interests me any longer I'll play other games. Rinse and repeat. It's just video games after all.
---
Do you know what exactly you lost?  Also what platform are you on?
---
I can see why you have a raider tag next to your name
---
Checking the misc quests tab for the 'Retrieve Loot' quest and then uncheck, recheck it might work.
---
That would actually be pretty cool but only an extension to colossal problem. Hopefully it’s extended out past monongah.
---
Where in the atom shop is the banner? Maybe I’m just blind but I didn’t see it.
---
Xbox and yeah a metric ton of black titanium, screws, and all that jazz
---
Ngl I hunt excavator armor users for sport, I shoot at their feet with explosive weapons and see how far I can yeet them. "Rocket man..."
---
I was going to give you what I could, but I'm on pc.
---
That’s the thing it’s not there at all for some reason
---
Like I dont want people to lose those guns they earned but just. Dont use em on low levels, just not fair or fun for any of us
---
I got a wedding ring, thinking i could propose her to be my wife and make babies. But her dialogue just stop at 'anything i could do for you' , 'how are you Sofia' , 'tell me about Space Sofia' , 'I think we need to talk' etc.... 😢 Where is 'Let's get marry Sofia and make babies!' I swear im not a Junkie build, Sofiaaaaaaaaa! 😢😑💔☢️
---
I didnt think ricochet worked for pvp.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought it says so right on the perk card.  Unless is bugged or I am thinking of a different card?
---
Thank. You. I was halfway through saying this in other words when I saw you had beat me to it
---
Honestly I'm happy that updating this part of the nuke run has been the furthest thing on Beth's roadmap. Like sure, patch the glitches that let people sidestep the actual challenge of the silos, but please don't make me do actual math once I get in there.
---
Tesla rifle let's you get some, but yeah, the insta kill everything is pretty shitty.
---
Ah it’s okay bro I’m prolly just gonna grind for it again thanks though
---
It's the closest thing we got. It's easier for chickens to mutate to swim than for crabs to mutate into the monstrous size of mirelurk queens. And yet here we are hahahha
---
Junkies might be a nice change of pace, might not do as much damage as bloodied, but it also wouldn't be as much maintenance either.
---
If I were going to do a stealth I believe I'd probably go bloodied or junkies as a second.
---
Personally, I'm to the point that I'm just coming up with my own stupid builds right now, been playing with stealth armor and a minigun for instance, works surprisingly well against the queen. While in stealth, and not even using the 2.5 sneak attack bonus perk card, I hit for around 47 at 209 fire rate. Bloodied Stealth Minigun build for the win. Lol
---
Sorry that happened to you.
---
No your right I misspoke.
---
Yeah me too
---
alright let’s see, the things I miss about gang life...hmm nothing short list
---
Supporting the Responders in rebuilding the land seems like the most logical quest chain to add, maybe it was even planned before all the chaos with bugs, pre-orders, bugs, and a somewhat... frustrated player-base? The BoS addition just feels like a desperate fan-service-thing. I hope there will be something other than fetch quests connected to this.
---
And as for being on the side of all them goody two shoes, that has never been my cup o tea in Fallout. I have always enjoyed RPing outcasts or complete psychos, siding with the Enclave, The Institute, or at times BoS.The only person I did not kill or attempt to kill in Fallout 3 was the old violinist lady... she played those sweet tunes just for me... &lt;3
---
It's a playstyle, you can fight back quite cheaply, 1 star unyielding set, good perception skills, and any legacy laser, but any bloodied weapon will do. Use stealth and sneak up on em. Try to get enough damage on them at once to kill them.
---
You can also get a 1* fancy revolver or 3* fancy shotgun, western outfit (not rare-ish) or western outfit w/ chaps (rare-ish)
---
And alot of crap
---
Mine was in the toxic wastes...
---
Basically same Scenario
---
I really don’t know where these rumours of burning through ammo with commando come from. When you switch a rifle from semi to full auto it does way more damage per shot. I go through less ammo, maybe people are spraying bullets everywhere. All you need to do is tap the trigger, you will shoot 1-3 bullets and most enemies will be dead. I’ve been running commando on all five characters (2 bloodied) and I’m sitting on 250k 5.56 and 100k .45.
---
nah, stay off my lawn!
---
Bugger. Had both situations happen myself over time. Sucks =\
---
42 here and still play StarCraft!!!
---
Definitely does suck
---
lol fucking Beckett
---
Let me take a really wild guess here. Fallout 3 was the first Fallout game you played?
---
Yeah, I don’t mind it, I just couldn’t figure out what was causing it or if it was alerting me of something.
---
What a strange strange bug.
---
Only kill players with a bounty they probably did something to another player so deserve it
---
My stealth melee build has me dealing about 8 or 9k damage to the sbq before I pop nukashine. Might wanna give that a try if you want some stealth damage
---
Yeah, for sure. Demo expert is a must. Can be a pain when ghouls or melee enemies gang up because I often blow myself away. I'm a bloodied commando and with my BE Fixer (a glorified combat rifle, rightfully so) I can do 400+ dmg with adrenaline maxed. Obviously Scorchbeasts have crazy explo resist but everything else gets swiss cheesed.
---
My problem with NW is you either die in no time or spend a majority of the match doing nothing, if I can take my time wasted in there and use it to build up my SCORE and character in Adventure mode I’d be a lot happier. The only thing NW really has going for it is the decent to good rewards
---
Pretty normal by Bethesda standards.
---
I use a twoshot gauss shotgun, no charge, large spread, and explosive shots. Only does like 20-30 damage.
---
If you look at the top right corner, there is a tab called 'Special'. Click on that tab and it will bring up the free stuff. As a side not, any time bethesda releases something free (and you see the 'free' icon next to the Atom shop button on the main menu), you should be able to find it on that tab.
---
Explosives can be affected by lag (try hitting a flying scorchbeast with a tracking missile...) bu more likely your shotgun is affected by “magic” Effect. Dunno about your minigun.
---
If anything, it became more popular.
---
Doesn’t the megasloth spawn with 2 Yao Guai
---
Last week I was on my way to sell a bunch of junk after stock pilling a scav run and fell into a fissure... Poof! All gone.
---
... wouldn't available skins make it more worth it? I'm confused. Is Thorn/Solar a skin or inherent to the armor piece?
---
It's my favorite XP farm.
---
I have no idea. I’m a bloodied rifleman. I just don’t like automatic weapons in Fallout, save for a few heavy weapons.
---
Explosives Expert
---
That was the initial intent: that launching nukes would be an endgame feat only accomplished by a small team of players working together.
---
Personally I was hoping for a mutated chicken that shot explosive eggs.
---
Yes, both junkies and 33% are both magical effects.
---
I mean all you really need is sneak and ninja or whatever the ranged perk card one is. You can roll the stealth boy one as well I guess, but then you’d be relying on those. I was stabbing the SBQ for like 200 last night unbuffed so it’s viable
---
Get well soon, man. My dad got it a few weeks back and we're lucky he recovered.
---
You can stack radshield and it brings the rads to a low enough level to manage with the right armor and occasional radaway
---
I hate to say it, but it's just a part of the game pal. I don't feed off the pvp energy, but there are pleanty that do. Avoid workshops or beef up your character for pvp, that's really the options. Being a day 1 player, and seeing this game change over time, it's way less brutal than it was early on.
---
When the game launched you could get murdered just walking around the wasteland, it might not be an instant kill because of dampened damage, but players would chase you around and chip away at your life till you died or fought back. So honestly, getting taken out once I a while by an OP build, while in a pvp zone, like a workshop, isnt that bad.
---
Also you can find resource nodes around the world as well, look up a map for them. If you place your camp on one of those nodes you can place an extractor down to get the resource just like in a workshop.
---
This needs to be per level and not tied to perk cards.  This solves the problem for people who have respeced their builds and keeps it simple for the devs.
---
Junkies full health non-stealth tank. Strength build. Primarily unarmed, but you can run shotguns (get a magic one) or heavy weapons with just perk swaps. Nice change of pace!
---
It's not really an "exploit" or it wasn't, anyways. It was an item you could blueprint with ease from the ammo factory. When you place it, it places 180 degrees (ish) rotated from where you intended, it can't be deleted or stored, and if you move your camp it becomes ghost budget you can never recover.There's more to lose than could ever be gained, imo.
---
I know, this is honestly the first time I've died while at a workshop by someone like this. A lot of times its lower level players who visit for to explore and see what's going on. And even more times I wont have anyone at my workshops at all.
---
Yeah, I don't like it either, but the rewards were worth it.  I'm at 93 on the board so I'll probably skip the NW that aren't take photos(in the lobby) or place camp.  
---
There is also the issue of bush wookies like me kind of ruining the mode for serious players.  How much fun is it really to search bushes to find someone who doesn't even have a weapon?  That said, I think leaving 1 NW challenge is fine and even adding another, as long as it doesn't replace an adventure mode one, make them 'bonus' challenges of sorts.
---
Which means, if you're trying to tag but not kill so everyone gets the heaps of xp and loot, aim wildly and inaccurately. Explosive splash damage is basically garbage no matter what, so tagging with splashing should be the goal.
---
I miss the days of slap damage.
---
That ski sword has me fucking dying of laughter. Especially when you're slaughtering people with it.
---
Ik how you feel now 😔
---
(Female here🤪) yeah I fell ill pretty rapidly on July 25th, still ill now. Sometimes I feel like I'm getting better then bam, next day I feel like I'm back at square one. The struggle is very real. Thing is, I've been wearing a mask &amp; doing social distancing since March &amp; I still got it. Most likely from infected people touching things at my local store or from delivery drivers not wearing gloves when they handle my things. I'm really glad your Dad got better &amp; thanks 🤗
---
Yeah I wasn’t using a bloodied knife either, just a zealots. It can really be fun, and I love being sneaky, but my build is mainly around melee and bloodied stuff (BE .50cal, BE handmade, etc). I still have never gotten a good bloodied melee though... Mainly looking for a bloodied Grognak’s Axe or knife
---
So there is a use for mininukes.
---
I didn't give them anything simply because I'm a cheap bastard. And I knew I could mooch off of community's contributions since the rewards (as non-impressive as they are) are for everyone.
---
Have you tried talking to her?

After I finished the quest, I had to go back to her to get it out of my inventory.
---
Yeah I got sneak up and a good chest piece I found but I’ll swap it for an unyielding when the time comes. Didn’t know if there was even more I could do to make a swift quiet build for PvE mainly
---
I've tried making SCP-049 it doesn't look the best sadly.
---
Green Hood
---
Hunter Long Coat
---
Plague Doctor Mask
---
Sabre 
---
Yeah that still bugs me the mask doesn't work yet some do.
---
For the shotty, are you either wearing at least 1 piece of armor with reduce damage while blocking or does the shotgun have the increased bash damage perk? Either way will glitch your shotty into a vats killing machine
---
Sometimes these high levels will pop in and help you defend your workshop as well, there are all kinds. Some people are dicks, some people aren't, some people just like playing the psychopathic raider. It is what it is, and what it is just so happens to be a game. In the end, server hop, and try again elsewhere. No point in indulging additional conflict, if they follow you, find their name in recent and block them.
---
I don't think they realize that those sets have inherent effects?
---
I don't know why they would be against them.
---
Even the "Atomic Camo" skin was given out to Fallout 1st members a few months ago, so the colors aren't unique to those sets, only the vines.
---
so its immersion for these npcs to treat us like complete strangers when we have been working diligently daily for them for several months? k
---
You only get one daily quest per day per zone. It rotates through which ones you get each day
---
 And you have to visit the zone to trigger it.
---
The camp ally, raider/settler/overseer dailies, and the pioneer scout dailies, and Bev, are independent of the 1/zone. But you have to visit them too.
---
Hmm explains why theirs were scattered all around and not lined up
---
Not really. Full Uny and harder to detect gear (if you think it’s necessary) and you’ll do just fine. It’s such a fun build to do, and quite easy to obtain and min/max (if that’s your thing).
---
Talking to the robots on your way out explains it somewhat.  They have been very busy keeping things working for however long it is you have been alone in the vault.
---
(and that all the food is gone so please leave)
---
I got ya. I'll be more careful. Not many even know Mount Blair exists. I go there to get it powered on to ride the buckets. That's about it.
---
They should just finish copying elder scrolls online system
---
After lvl50 convert lvls to PC “perk coin” lvls lower the requirement to rank up legendary perk by 90%
---
Public teams work almost all the time unless you get kicked or everyone leaves or something.
---
If you exit to desktop or crash you will come back with "Play With Team" instead of "Play."  Alt-F4 or quitting to menu though will drop you from the team.
---
I have the same problem with my Scorched Mirelurk King, he hates my collection and one particular generator.
---
Hate to say it, but I really don't. Lol
---
I do wish they would bring survival mode back though. Imo, dividing the PvP players and casual/PVE players just made sense to me.
---
ah, that's what I was missing - I have to visit the location. thanks!
---
I thought this was going to be 10 pictures of bushes.
---
Yes im at level 88. Havent bought a single level even missed 9 days because i was playing army in the desert 🤣
---
Same here.  About 1800 hours.   If they did a damage cap, what's the point of even getting the gold bullion and special weapons?
---
Grind XP. it’s repeatable. I usually ding it 3-4 times a day
---
What do you mean by min/max specifically?
---
Those are Claim TICKETS, not TOKENS.
---
The Tokens are from the Lode Bearing Event, the Tickets are random from Ghouls and Scorched.
---
Im at 70 with nothing bought but damn man the brotherhoods coming and i got a ton of atoms lol
---
One last thing, while probably obvious, if you ever decide to get Fo1st, you obviously won't run into resistance in workshops on your private server, unless your friends are dicks. Lol
---
The Enclave wants you!....
---
...to die, because you are impure, subhuman, mutie scum.
---
Got ya
---
Yes, please.
---
Ive been saving atoms just incase i cant get the last few for whatever reason, but i think its totally do-able. Its supposed to be challenging i think most of the people complaining about the grind arent really adjusted to the concept of seasons in games yet.
---
Haha I never ask myself that, because I already know it's my 785 reg and my 315 super stimpacks doing it lol
---
I was having the autocomplete bug for a few days in a row, but I've kind of switched how/when I log off and when I log back on. Given we have double daily challenges coming up, I'd say you still have a good chance. (:
---
What I've started doing is logging out (as in, backing all the way out to the main menu before completely closing the app) about 20 minutes before reset (12pm EST), and I don't log back in for at least thirty minutes. Been doing this for about two weeks now and haven't run in to anymore issues. I don't know for certain if it's a temporary solution, but I figured I'd share anyway. ): Good luck!
---
All the +% damage and strength foods, all the chems, all the right mods for gear and weapons. There’s so much stuff to boost damage in this game it’s ludicrous, but most of the time stuff like that can be a bit overkill.
---
I'm halfway through rank 79. I got there supported only by lunchbox XP buffs, food XP buffs, and Todd Howard's tears.
---
&gt;Nothing holy about it.
---
They were conceptualized in Fallout 1 as a group of isolationist futuristic monks. Their track in the OST is literally called "Metallic Monks". Their bunker was their monastery. Even the map of Lost Hills had a very scroll-like, scripture feeling.
---
I've got about 15 levels left. I've only used the atoms i get from the SCORE levels to buy more levels.
---
Okay that’s what I thought, yes I’m definitely obsessed with that at the moment. I just figured out a couple weeks ago that bloodied literally changes the damage of your guns real time haha, I liked the game so much more at that point. I love how technical it all gets
---
Exactly this. Long term progress on the game allows for a long time life to the game. Something similar to endless dungeons or infinite leveling. Think similar to the Paragon levels and the GRifts on Diablo 3. Essentially end game progress that is long term, just a reward for the constant push you do every day in the game.
---
Are you sure  you're still using the Vampire?  Bug will swap your hotwheel shortcuts with other weapons of the same type from the inventory.
---
Otherwise look up magic shotguns.  You were doing something that you aren't now.  VATS is required, if  you were out of fusion core and can't use VATS, that would be it.
---
Uh.., Serendipity works for all builds.  Nerfing it would only make Bloodied more OP.
---
Barbarian 100%. Uny adds special pts, Barbarian adds 2 DMG resist per point of strength. Make u STRONK. Also since you'll be at low health to utilize the armors stuffs, radicool and nerd rage are great too. Greater rads = more STRONKNESS and below 20% health greater STRONKNESS.
---
Cool.
---
Completed it maybe 2 weeks ago. Exp boosts from herbivore+unyielding armor are op
---
I’m interested, what you got?
---
Not that many, but since my CTD’S prior to the patch were like 1/week (and I dual client, so I’m not nice to the game), it’s much much worse, yeah.
---
Dude it’s a fucking game
---
You'll get to a certain point playing when you have more levels saved up than you know what to do with.   For me it was somewhere around 120. Once you get to that point you'll try stuff out for the hell of it and then home your build some more. I've got about four different builds I swap between depending on my mood.
---
should i invest in serendipity too? Or nah?
---
I'm at like 84 and haven't purchased any. Also missed a set of weeklies due to auto completing.
---
I think it might have been a day or two ago where the NW challenge was "place 3 camps". I ran solo and figured that I'd just stick around and see how it went. Aside from sitting at the bottom of grafton for half the match, I ended hanging on the side of a cliff when the circle was small enough that you could easily see anyone across the circle without a scope. At this point it was just me versus a team of 3. I just looked straight up as I heard them moving about, panic-shot a grenade launcher and missed as a guy peeked over the edge and ran. Funny thing was, since none of them even shot once, I just ran back up and we ended the match with a fist-fight....I lost the first round lol
---
I love RPing as the Enclave :D My entire build even shows that. No legendaries and only Enclave weapons.
---
In power armor I actually carry a jetpack slotted chest piece to switch them out cause I'm not a fan of how the PA armor jetpack looks.
---
I'm at 84 today. I've played every day and I've gotten most but not all challenges. I've skipped most of the NW challenges that weren't able to be done in the first two minutes or less.
---
I've skipped some because I've ran out of time because I had stuff to do IRL or just didn't feel like it.
---
I kinda want to finish on my own but I also kinda want to buy the last ten levels and give it a rest. I'll probably stick it out though.
---
That is where, imo, you are wrong my friend. What other builds RELY on low health? Junkie's? Vanilla Heavy? Berserker's?
---
You're the kind of reseller I always worry about when I try to be nice and sell stuff cheap.
---
Serendipity is good, yeah. It's very satisfying when you take a mini nuke to the face and serendipity negates the dmg. That one is so second nature I forgot to mention it. Serendipity = more STRONK.
---
I havent missed a day, but missed lets’s
---
say a third of the NW challenges, and havent had any autocompletes nor bought levels. at level 91 now.
---
Not from the way they were talking. Different regions  will still be limited by max level, so the forest might be max level 30 so a level 50 player who goes to the forest would get a level 30 wolf. Likewise areas like the bog will have minimum levels so nothing in the bog would be lower than say 30.
---
Found this out a while ago and showed other people. Ive mostly had "what the fuck" or damn that's pretty neat" type reactions.
---
Yes.  Settler version is Division of Wealth where you go rescue Penelope Hornwright.
---
Nice thnx, one last question, what About the playstyle? Should i play it safe? Or go all out?
---
Depends what your fire rate is.
---
Do you have a CLAIM TICKET?
---
Also adrenal reaction mutation is a must. For STRONK purposes.
---
You're forgetting that there are more than 7 perk cards and that it costs coins to swap them in and out.
---
Just kill the traveling trader
---
This. Let people enjoy things man. No need for long winded posts like this.
---
sweet, ill keep my eyes out for green hoods.
---
Between the eyes old yeller style
---
That's bullshit and you know it
---
Yup, it's also one of the reasons I sided with the raiders. At least Meg was originally from Appalachia and fled. The settlers are a bunch of refugees from Philly and The Pitt.
---
That does in fact work
---
I think it's just generically for the damage mitigation, saves you on stims I guess, I can see the appeal to it but I prefer dodgy as I'm not bloodied
---
No, flamingos are a unit of measurement.
---
Does having fireproof help at all?, I've got lvl 1, and I'm tempted to max it out
---
Honestly, if they were intent on nerfing the build, I'd say the best bet is just to make content that's more difficult for everyone, and as a result makes Bloodied's flaws less appealing..  
---
Take my beloved Vault 94 for example.   
---
I never encountered anyone who could viably run a bloodied build in there. Between the constant and sometimes fairly severe rads (that GECK room was a nightmare), and the sheer volume of incoming damage, it was never a matter of ignoring damage 45% of the time, because any damage coming through was basically fatal if were under half your max health.   
---
The risk was simply too great, and the reward fundamentally worthless because killing in there really didn't mean anything.  
---
Great, you hit for thousands of damage, there's about 15 ghouls behind the one you just killed, waiting to put that to the test.  
---
Plus, they aren't the enemy, the clock is, so if you're killing them when you could be gaining time, you're going to lose anyway.  
---
"A Colossal Problem" also does it well; between the swarms of Wendigo who like to sneak up on you, to the loss of control potentially putting you into the turbine or a roof collapse, it makes Bloodied risky as hell, because one mistake is all it's going to take.  
---
Now, while it's a different topic technically, I will say that, if that's the route to take for late game content, the rewards should be worth it.
---
I'm pretty sure this is why I got rid of them altogether. Enemies only spawn if I'm there, and they destroy the turrets faster than the turrets destroy them. And they just aggro everything, so it's just easier to not have them.
---
I'm in the Savage Divide, though, so that may help since enemies are not so relentless.
---
Likely framerate.  It is also still based on the weapon damage somewhat, so make sure to boost it, hitting for 1 will not be as good as hitting for 3+.
---
I especially love it when everything spawns inside your buildings, so you have to play marco-polo with the turret fire until you find where they are
---
I'd like to see different repeatables instead of XP. Have something like complete 20 events or something.
---
Once you know where they are, you see them all the time.  I always grab the one on the roof of the Tattoo parlor for instance when I do Tipsy Taste Test.
---
FYI there’s a fixed spawn location for the pie, so it’s not worth much now...
---
Well you can easily find the pies as a world spawn at west tek
---
Don't forget to put some INT in there for bonus XP.  You'll also probably find Stabilized and Nerd Rage are good eventually.
---
THANK YOU.  This in an awfully long winded post for just trying to schill a YouTube video. I can't stand that. Why do we care if you make a video?
---
Honestly once you've spec'd out the build you'll feel invincible and will do a massive amount of damage, but you can still be a little squishy to your lowest dmg resistance type. You also have to be cautious of rads and posion. I'm a bloodied stealth commando that used bolstering over unyielding (because I'm not using strength -&gt; Barbarian) and the stealth isn't just for the sake of my health. My bloodied explosive + per fixer can do over 400 damage with adrenaline maxed, I one tap basically every normal enemy and most huge creatures too with the stealth bonus. It's kinda crazy. I do find myself managing my rads to have the max health while still activating all my perks.
---
Because Jesus wants you banned.
---
I'm at 95.5 right now. I've got to imagine I'll be done when the next set of weeklies come around. I've completed every daily except for 5, when I got that stupid auto complete bug.
---
They change/nerf/un-nerf things so often it's hard for me to know if I should get rid of them. I'm not in a tough spot random enemy-wise or anything, but I have come back to multiple pets being murdered regardless of whether or not I have turrets, so maybe it's not worth it.
---
Serendipity IS the most OP perk in the game IMO, I just don't see how it really favors Bloodied.  I run a full health Instigating/Furious/Vampires mostly melee Vanguard build.  I dive into mobs of Ghouls or charge straight at Super Mutants with miniguns and that perk has saved my ass 45% of the time.  Because of the perk, I don't HAVE to play Bloodied to be effective.
---
BROTHERHOOD OF STEAL
---
I kinda love this idea. It lets diffrerent builds shine in different scenarios. I think that full HP medics would become more viable when the content is made more difficult.
---
That perk is SO underrated. With fireproof not only does it do... What it says it does, but it makes you 100% invulnerable to scorchbeast blasts. (Not poo spray) There's still a decent chance you blow yourself up, though.
---
The shotgun you can probably get ~5000 caps (give or take) if it's max level, though it might take a while to sell.  Set it for less if you want a quick sale.
---
The pies are overpriced at 100 caps, though you might be able to get that much or a bit more if the buyer doesn't know where to get one every day.  I have 8 or 10 in my stash and occasionally put one up for about that much, and they sit a long time before they sell.
---
There’s legendary perks??
---
My camp is in the savage divide at he bottom of a cliff.  Best part is that the enemies always spawn on thop of the cliff for some reason. 
---
Unless its mole rats or other tunneling enemies, the basically just stand up there unsure of what to do.  Enemies with guns put bullets into the ground as well.
---
I recently planted a BlackBerry patch up there for the plant crops dailies as I can remove and replant to complete, even if they're broken, and now I dont ever have anything actually attack me camp proper.  They just stay up there.
---
I'd rather a more organized UI (through the entire game, actually). :(
---
Ohh gotcha thnx for the tips mate appreciate it :&gt;&gt;
---
The point is we shouldn’t have to grind xp just to fix Bethesda’s mistakes
---
Probably has something to do with retention rates and a perceived correlation level and story progression.  Like, probably the bulk of inactive accounts after free weekends are at the point in levels/story where you cross paths with high level players in the savage divide and Bethesda thinks it makes people quit.
---
and here I sit at level 40 wishing I had something to do with all the cards I'll never use, like cards that I already had a max card of and still received 4 more copies because they couldn't make it so once you have a maxed perk it's impossible to receive it from a pack.
---
Do you even play eso? You can get 4 level just by doing a first dungeon.
---
95 with today's dailies.  It's SLOW at this point, but the next weekly + daily combo should get me within spitting distance.
---
After playing Ark with preserving bins and refrigerators I think it's a huge missed opportunity not to have something similar in this game.
---
It's really not.  Glassed caverns is totally broken, so is tanagra town.  The more people in there the more xp you make.  With 6 people you literally cannot kill the scorched fast enough.  You have a scorchbeast every 30-60 seconds.  It's really not hard.
---
Well, your post/comment history checks out
---
Honestly, Beserker should be outdamaging Bloodied.
---
I completed it a few days ago, legit grinding
---
Lmao
---
I sat in a bush for 17 minutes.  Got 3rd, never saw another player.  Grafton Monster got me.  Super lucky that my bush ended up in the final zone.
---
my cards aren't auto deleted like I have 6 action boy cards... and quite a few other dupes and I'm only level 40
---
Molotovs seem popular in this situation
---
Teslas can cause issues, and they bug out after a while, and are definitely NOT recommended.
---
I found a hunter's explosive combat rifle (I'm commando), and it does enough AoE to tag a lot of the mobs without actually killing anything. (only useful if someone is bugging out the spawns, but when they all drop at the center, I can tag about everything in less than a mag).  If they're spawning normally, I just tag them manually with my regular rifle.
---
Something that takes 1-2 years to level is again bad design.  A) It creates a massive divide for new players, which can completely dampen any incentive to actually go for that B) It will create even more burnout on the game - when the game begins to feel like a job vs. a game, then your game has failed and players will begin to quit C) It's lazy design - It's like when a MMO creates a brutal leveling curve to hide the fact there is nothing to do at max level and they don't want to be bothered to actually create engaging content
---
I didn't play much today, but I did notice my shotgun was weird today. Like you had mentioned, it was taking more hits than usual to kill stuff
---

Nothing wrong with reselling mate it’s part of the economy. Not my fault he didnt take advantage of it.
---
Nerfs are not needed. Buffs are the true fix. Make things favorable. Buff weaker builds. Make them enticing. Bonuses.
---
The 1* ones that don't rank up are deleted. They are cheating us vets out of coins from the get-go, unless they planned to compensate those but I've never read them mention it and I dunno how they'd even track it.
---
...a bloodied explosive double barrel shotgun and two perfectly preserved pies.
---
93 as of tonight. Zero atoms spent.  Did all daily's/weeklys and have to grind a bit to level up.  Next round I'll probably skip the NW stuff as I'll finish a couple weeks early.
---
If you can take a look at the Possum challenges, that can give you a clue as to valuable recipes and plans.  Also investigate "Fallout 76 rare plans" and "Fallout 76 rare outfits" so that you don't accidentally sell something valuable for really cheap.
---
Price ammo no more than 1 c each unless it's ultracite ammo....but it'll be awhile before you're making that.
---
Next to nothing sells in a decent timeframe at the game's listed price unless it's a very special weapon or something like the Halloween costumes.   If you price things at about 10 percent of their suggested price, you're closer to the truth.  The only way to know is research and look at what others are charging, and maybe a couple online sites.  
---
Legendary weapons used to sell well, but from what I've seen, their demand has collapsed with the release of the gold bullion weapons (except the very valuable legendaries, which can be very, very expensive).
---
Holy shit I got this confused with another post I’m sorry hahaha I’m stupid
---
Well, I think One Wasteland might cover this...if they don't f it up
---
Well that's it.   
---
There's no reason to kneecap somebody for enjoying what they have and what they've worked for, but at the same time, no one build should be good at everything (sort of).  
---
I mean, I run a general Heavy Gun build centered around my PA.   
---
I'm not gonna "wow" anyone with my numbers, but I also haven't died in months, barring accidentally auto-running into a fissure, and that's including during PTS testing.  
---
But with 94, once I realized the clock was my enemy, I rebuilt around Pain Train, to the point I now normally run Overdrive Servos and I'm really looking forward to Power Sprinter. I also run my weight ratios really lean which is just a generally good lesson.  
---
We go this route, and people get to experiment with medic builds, maybe because something is doing such general acid or electric damage (flooding with a power source for example) that if you relied on heaps of stimpaks you'd bleed through them before you were done.  
---
Maybe a specific sniper build becomes viable, not because of its damage per se, but because it allows a precise VATS hit on an enemy that would otherwise just soak up damage (maybe a really armored mirelurk or something.)  
---
Maybe a melee build is necessary because the target is shielded at long range.  
---
Just, interesting, difficult content that we have to work around.  
---
It allows people to get experimental with builds without just wrecking existing ones.
---
I mainly do dailies &amp; events,  go into a building events team &amp; use xp boosts; lovers embrace &amp; cranberry relish.  I have herbivore mutation so I get extra.  I always do path to enlightenment when it comes up.  In events like line in the sand,  try not to use your most powerful weapons,  nothing one shot. Try to make sure you &amp; your team mates can tag as many enemies as possible so that everyone earns the XP.   Going after mobs of super mutants is good for xp so go hunting at West tek, huntersville &amp; abandoned bog Town for example.  I usually manage to level up 2-3 times most evenings doing this and am currently at rank 85.
---
Something that actually deals a significant amount of damage instead of being puny, annoying motherfuckers like the mole rats.
---
Since when were Pies valuable? I have 16 of the things, and that was before the fixed location.
---
This. Needs to be over 200. Think an LMG needs the FFR
---
Yeah, I don't have pets. Or anything left to aggro enemies.
---
Pretty much the only thing I find gone is my Brahmin/Fertilizer collector. I have to repair that a lot. They don't seem to touch much else.
---
I mostly get Radstags and they really only seem to spawn after I start using one of the crafting benches. As soon as I'm in that menu and animation, boom! Radstag gangbang.
---
I saw two players vote for "Unknown" in a match a few days ago. Anyone know what that's about?
---
With commando fixer it's easier to stay in stealth when shooting and with the right build, you can just sort of hold down the spacebar and spam crits.  Absent the presence of broken magic weapons it's very effective against high HP enemies like the queen.  At least that's how it's been explained to me.
---
SAMURAI FOOL!!!
---
Not sure if this is related, but since the last patch, some power armor paint jobs are negating the PA's rad resistance. The main paints I am hearing are the new junk paint job and the settlers paint
---
oh. didnt know that. I'm just pissed I cant get hacking 3 or gunsmith til after 50 since I have no more points for intel, kinda the same deal with my melee char and her weapon crafting
---
Yeah I did that part and it was gone but now its just in my inventory there like 🗿 wuz good
---
Teslas don't cause issues other that the ash pile thing.  Better to tag as many as possible than get nothing by running around with my combat knife.  If people didn't insta kill shit the Tesla wouldn't be 'recommended'.
---
edit- Same thing that happens at Uranium Fever, just on steroids at Line in the Sand.
---
Power Patcher is for PA, White Knight is for regular armor.
---
Whether or not it *actually* works that way is another question though.  I don't run it (or use PA very often), so I can't chime in on whether or not it's bugged.
---
Thanx.
---
The main rule of stock: buy for low, sell for high.
---
You mean a bunch of them running around, with tiny beards and explosive vests, stealing planes, crashing them into buildings?
---
I purposely target players who wear it.
---
I'm not forgetting anything, I'm just talking bare MINIMUMS here. 
---
And you can only equip 6 Legendary Perks, not 7. Did they ever finalize the cost to swap Legendary Perks?
---
Just pay attention to where nukes are dropping and, if you have to, server hop before it drops.   It's usually hard to anger someone that badly, but  there are a few out there who are pretty reactionary.
---
I get it bro
---
I certainly hope they rethought how seasons should work then.
---
I’d be happy to actually have it complete for me. 
---
Here’s how it works for me lately: fast travel to event. Kill first leader. Fast travel to second location. Event fails.
---
Kill first leader. Fast travel to second location. Kill second leader. Fast travel to third location. Event fails.
---
I don’t even attempt it anymore on my level appropriate character.
---
Could be related, but I’m having these problems outside of power armor. I also don’t have the junk paint unlocked.
---
I too agree it's underrated, I knew about the scorcebeast deal that's y I'm probably gonna max it out, but u hardly see it used in a lot of builds, I just didn't know if it lowers all explosive damage including your own, with that in mind i heard there is a mod for the Secret Service armor that pretty much acts like Fireproof I think I'll add that when I get it and hopefully it's stacks
---
It would be great fun to be able to do that.
---
Last PTS it was 1. I'm anticipating it to be higher now.
---
Did that one work with Scout and Vault 94 armor? I feel like adding the Gillie suit is redundant on the Vault 94 armor.
---
So that essentially means fucking people that reskilled over 5 times.
---
No, cards should only give a bonus point so you can get rid of the ones you really don't want, but otherwise each level should give increasing legendary perk points. Maybe starting at one or two points per level and increasing by one every 50 levels - you do the math.
---
There is an atoms starter bundle you can buy with real money that’s cheaper than buying atoms but can only buy it once. 800 + 400 free
---
Think you also get some free outfit plans with it as well
---
Oh, forgot to mention that I'm on xbox. Gamertag bl00dymaria.
---
I would love to have radium rifles get a buff. I have a nice 3* medic one I love whipping out from time to time but it's very underwhelming vs my fancy PA and anti armor gauss shotguns.
---
Couple spawn in blackwater mine area, Morgantown train yard, flooded train yard, robco, abandoned bog town?, dryer chemical, etc. Usually on ground or shelving ,behind loose clutter. The most i ever got from one was when the game first came out, one of them had 1500+ caps.
---
Just hit 90 today, have not done any grinding besides getting a level each day really.  I think I’ll be done with Tuesday’s weeklys
---
I think it's all in the Whitespring Bunker terminals, albeit corrupted, but you can piece together what happened and who was responsible. The little Chinese Liberator bots, that was also the Enclave; they kept trying to manufacture different threats until it finally registered DEFCON 1. (And killed everyone in the process.)

Your guess would be wrong. I have also played the original isometric Fallout games.
---
They've talked about removing the negative aspects of not eating in the future.  With any luck they'll also remove (or at least greatly nerf) the spoilage mechanic.
---
The ash pile thing is an issue, breaking *all* ranged weapons damage is an issue.  There's other perceived issues that I don't believe are true, but other people will eventually try to call you out on.
---
I used one for a bit, the 500 caps I spent on the combat rifle was money well spent.
---
That's not intended gameplay. You invalidated your argument.
---
Earn with levels, scrap cards for bonus points.
---
It works on generic Scout, but as far as I know, it doesn't currently work on the Vault 94 gear.
---
It definitely doesn't work on the Vault 94 Mask, I just tested that one a few days ago.
---
Visual bug here too.   It looked like both my enemies and myself were the recipients of cryo attacks.
---
Yeah, your tiny anecdotal bubble doesn't really matter.
---
Yeah, 2 points in fireproof and what I think is the dense mod? On your chestpiece is roughly equivalent to 3pt fireproof. You also shouldn't take damage from shooting at your feet or at close walls, but that all depends on how much damage you're doing. However, for some reason this doesn't work the same way with close enemies, and you'll do a lot of self inflicted damage if enemies get too close.
---
Short version? DPS.
---
There’s two types of bloodied builds, to my knowledge. Raw damage, and DPS. You’re raw damage, you get the one shots. 
---
The DPS dudes don’t care about one shot, they care about shredding as much as they can, as fast as they can. Hence, they use bloodied with fast fire rate guns. Little more effective for tanks.
---
I’m personally not a fan of bloodied.
---
Dayum. That chicken was packing heat. I can just imagine it going all Anton Chigurh all around the wasteland until you put a stop to it.
---
What should happen is buff existing legendaries to be more viable. 
---
Junkie is the only one that’s half decent.
---
The little ship was 1/3 through the run when I bought Fo76 during a steam sale. Now I'm a couple spots ahead of it.
---
your still a nice guy for doing it, i mean,  a resell trader bought it, but there was just as high of a probability that a noob or someone creating another toon could have bought it
---
I mean.
---
I did the math.
---
The thing is the approach I took was just based on the design Bethesda insists on pushing out. At least this way, it takes 50 Levels to Max a Legendary Perk, and not 125.
---
Oof. I don’t even know how to launch them yet so you don’t gotta worry about me
---
Which exploit?
---
Ign: HotMessMandy. I don't talk a lot because I have difficulties getting their terrible audio system to work right. However I am very generous and will give away presents, plans, and much help
---
I was dismayed to see the Fallout 4 app for Android was removed from the play store.
---
The ios version current have sound on my iPhone, so it's inferior.
---
That may be, but the Tesla is my best way to get xp at events like UF, One Violent Night and Line in the Sand if it's glitched.  No one else is trying to cooperate so I'll take what I can get with my Tesla.  It does like 57 damage to everything it hits, so it's not like I'm trying to be a boss, just trying to get the xp.
---
Got it, bloodied commando build = squishy, bloodied commando explosive build = extra squishy haha
---
Nvm camp budget. When you load into a game it loads your toon, your stash and your camp. Everything has a set limit as to keep the server at optimal performance. Which is why they set public world to only 24 rather then 50 or 100.
---
But when you have a guy exceeding his wieght capacity by millions due to over duping, it adds to the overhead. Now imagine 5 or 6 of those guys on the same server.
---
I have noticed when we do the tree at Tanager town, the more meat piles that we make.. it seems to make the game act up. Sound doesn't work, guns fire and keep firing even when they aren't.
---
This is why I assume the game is buggy at all. Way over budgeted players.
---
As for the camp. I'd love to be able to connect to a friends camp. Like a hamster house
---
I always go white springs, huntersville, west tek, national isolated radio for xp and legendaries. I might include burrows in the mix.
---
I’d definitely help if they seem like they need it. Are the nuke bunkers the ones with all the robots and laser turrets or is that something else. I saw it on a livestream and I just kinda assumed it was a nuke bunker
---
Ok. So I shouldn’t repair it then?
---
Thank you, it took more than 400 caps and a lot of fast traveling!
---
SAY ELLO TO MY LIL FRIEND
---
**BRRRRRRRRRRRRRT**
---
Definitely. I’ve had a few give me some stuff here and there. Always made sure to throw up a heart emote. But as a level 5 I didn’t really have anything of interest for a level 100+
---
Yeah, I have been using punk till they fix him. I love gramps 
---
"Hey Kid, pull my finger. Woops, too late!"
---
Holy crap dude! That’s a lot of hard work and caps, here is my poor man medal 🥇
---
Yeh I discounted all mine down to about 10-25 after seeing all these responses
---
Thank you so much! I humbly accept.
---
Yeh I don’t think I’ve had anything rare yet but ya never know. What are these gold bullions you speak of?
---
Shoulda been a wet willy at wavy willard's waterpark.
---
Remember stay safe stay hydrated
---
The stupid stash size limit is contrary to the design of a junk hoarding game. Fallout 4 had no such limit. Whoever decided to limit stash size is probably evil, and has harmed the game overall with that decision.
---
The amount of memory, storage, and server resources that world be required to store 1,000,000 of every item in the game is negligible, so the statements that this was necessary for server stability is bs.
---
I say stop nerfing altogether,  if somebody wants to run at 1/4 Health but do extra damage that's their choice, if somebody wants to be a bullet sponge I say go for it, if what you're complaining about is people one shotting enemies so that you cannot even get a round in to get the loot? there are always going to be guys like that, I personally do get frustrated and when there is one in an event that know their OP and dosnt care, I simply server hop til I find a group I like playing with
---
Yeah, I'd wager that was just to prove the switching works.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being something absurd, like 100 Coins to swap.
---
Thank you, you too!
---
And the Atom shop. They're missing a way to get people while they're offline.
---
Ok. Since posting this I’ve been on for a few hours and made sure to keep an eye on their prices and have somewhat dropped them to be a little more reasonable
---
The rubber banding is awful on anything that 1-shots foes. I have a 1\* instigating combat shotty that can kill almost anything in 1 hit save bigger foes like scorchbeasts, but man does it get annoying. Apparently any legendary arm piece with the perk "15% less melee damage while blocking" solves this somehow, because it just "works".
---
Actually it does.  There are lots and lots of people that are very high level.  Hell we just got done with Godmode stacking that allowed people to do this kind of experience like 100x faster.  But that left them with a lot of lost packs since they didn't apply in god mode so I never did it.   I literally saw someone level like 200 levels in a day, and they're not banned.   Everything you do in this game gives you xp all you gotta do is play it and you level.  The grind is literally nothing.  The problem is people want to have everything handed to them when they login for 5 mins.  If you don't like the grind then don't play the game.  I do it because I love the game and having a great time playing it
---
Heh, colossal problem. still in game but not playable ?   
---
Bethesda is absolutely lost w/o modding community. Kek
---
When you realise the only reason they lasted so long is their tech..they lost to people with wind up laser rifles and cannons made of plumbing parts...  
---
 Tactical genius Maxson was decided to piss off the leader of of the local militia while parking his hydrogen blimp in clear view of their fortress.Did no one in the chain of command go "Hey boss those are artillery pieces they can literally shot anything in all of the commonwealth."
---
Yes.
---
\^ This. You basically deal so much damage in one shot that your enemy died, reincarnated and plopped out of the womb again all healthy.
---
Legen... wait for it... poultry.
---
What do you do with all the legendary items?
---
I think they said there will be minimum levels - not sure how it differs from the current system.
---
So hoard as many crops as possible? Sorry, I’m a tad confused.
---
Who knows maybe they will make it where they 4 and 5th slot are moddable positions?
---
lol all good
---
I’ve made sure to double check where they’re aimed at and so far all I’ve seen is SBQ luckily
---
Meanwhile I'm right behind you challenging every Workshop you take muhahaha
---
Did you even read my comment or did you just look at the title? I don't have a problem with people dealing absurd damage. I have a problem with people dealing absurd damage AND being tanky
---
What do stable fluxes do cause I think I got some from a sbq but I don’t know what they do. Tbh might hav scrapped them.
---
Add me im down to play anytime. Noa Serts End.
---
😆
---
a lot of people don't care for the mmo aspect of this mess. a huge chunk of the playerbase treats Fo76 as Fo4 with friends.
---
case in point, wastelanders, a singleplayer-focused expansion, did more for the health of the game than any other addition thus far. and the subsequent bullion grind after the paltry content was done with drove a lot of returning (and new) players away.
---
You get 10 times 150 atoms during the run , spend it to level up if you get a bit behind.
---
Ok. I don’t plan on going out of my way for pvp but never know. If I see one when I’m a little better equipped I’ll check it out
---
As an Enclave General I have concerns about a rogue military group setting up here.
---
As a player of the franchise I'm happy to see them even though it feels a bit forced and over done, but then I remember what the did to the NCR town of Redding after Fo2 and specifically targeted their gold mines and forced the NCR off their Gold Standard and get a bit worried about our recent discoveries.
---
In short I am hoping to see the BoS roots of "All your tech belongs to us."
---
Wym. Do you break their fences since they hav prices high or does repairing stuff drop the prices? Sorry I’m a tad confused
---
It would make since to release the 4 and 5 stars after 1 wasteland drops. Everything will scale to you.
---
I’m at 63 and sweating because I didn’t think I’d finish but Zorbo has been slackin, I’m on his ass
---
Yes but unlike those events primal cuts is almost always happening
---
It's a currency that you get by completing the Wastelander's settler/raider questline and by getting T-notes from public events (along with daily quests from the settlers and raiders).    Once you complete Wastelanders, you can cash in gold bullion at the Secret Service vault, the raiders or settlers to get really great end-game things.
---
Forgot to say:   you cash in T-notes, 20 at a time, for gold bullion.
---
The free states were not really what I would call military material. One small squad of rangers ran them all out of Thunder Mountain
---
Ok. I’ll have to be on the look out for the quests
---
Ah sorry we only give vodka and hats to slaves
---
Depends on how you play
---
Yes I am using unyielding. Do I have to get rads again?
---
Smokey the Bear disliked that.
---
I have no shame being a food build when I can hit the queen for 20k
---
Here's the buffs if you want to try  
---
Deathclaw wellington + 40%  
---
Glowing meat steak + 25%  
---
Mutant hound chops + 25%  
---
Mutant hound stew + 37%  
---
Mutton chops + 25%  
---
Mutton meat pie + 37%  
---
Yao guai ribs + 25%  
---
Yao guai roast + 37%  
---
Nukashine (unarmed) + 100%  
---
Psychobuff + 40%  
---
Calmex (Sneak) + 15%  
---
Convert Operative will also add 50% to unarmed sneak attacks ;)
---
They don't have to be, but they have been, and they are the only group serving in the Tech Preserver trope capacity.   
---
At this point if they were not there in some capacity I would question if it was even a real fallout title.
---
Face hugger liberators would be fun
---
Okay got it! Thanks!
---
Lol you better get used to stuff like this happening because it will happen again :D
---
If on xbox and its max lvl I'll buy for 6k
---
That’d be nice, though 20 events seems like a lot unless each repeatable has different SCORE values
---
We already did the grind, that's why we are where we are. If they want a 'lifetime' system that rewards us as long as the game exists,  they can always add legendary perks - being level 500 should let you max at least half of the existing cards.
---
I’ve got two characters both over 200 and I hate those fuckers
---
To be honest, Bethesda designed it to be fo4 with friends. It was marketed that way too.
---
Also lights or any light related unit (neon letters, etc.)
---
This reminded me of a lvl 1 Legendary Beaver I found in the early days of 76 in the Cranberry Bog, just west of Watoga. Didn't think much of it an killed it and got a Rolling Pin.
---
But a Legendary Chicken sounds way cooler than a beaver.
---
They shouldn't be this hard to kill, they're not that "meaty" if you know what I mean
---
I could see a whole other vault since there are a few more. I doubt they would over ride quests set in stone and say if you've done it already then too bad
---
Oh yeah, I know what you mean. That damn laserbeam fucks me up.
---
The sad thing is that Lyons is the real outcast with Maxon being a reunification and return to BoS West Coast Ideology. In all truth the BoS should be demanding all out Enegy Weapons with the payment of not being shot at.
---
Nope the bug is still there, replicated 2 days in a row. Had to re-equip Class Freak for it to take effect, just thought I'd let you know
---
What everyone else is saying, only day to buy missing ranks is the final day.
---
Its a major issue legendary robots either blow up sky high and are a pain to find or just fall into the void. 
---
Not sure if you know this but if your looking for legendarys. Go farm charleston capital building and fort defiance. i think it scales to your level but if not. Level 60 ghouls are not all that hard to fight at your level. Once you get decent weapons and armor go hit up west tek 
---
Once you kill everything hop servers and repeat.
---
Me and my friends are looking for something to do as well
---
Wastelanders added nothing to the game that isnt already in every fallout game. Annoying, poorly written stories attached to randomly named near identical npcs that does nothing more than add a fetch quest in some fashion. Who every pays fallout and elder scroll games for the stroy wouldnt know a good story in a game if it blasted them in the face with a mini nuke.
---
Bethesda games have one thread in common, \*\*MASSIVE\*\* open worlds with huge amounts of areas to explore and find easter eggs in. The only difference between the two main franchises is lore, and combat. Both of which have excellent former, bare mnimum latter. Bethesda games have wonderful storied histories set in amazingly detailed universes, and always seems to plop truds of stories in our laps when it comes to main quests or primary faction stories.
---
Chinese Stealth Suit
---
Crappy lol but idk sorry I’m of no use
---
Thank god. I hate these things.
---
Have you never come across the lvl +50 variants? Maybe its because I'm not bloodied and don't 1-tap everything but I definitely have to be careful around a swarm of them, especially when they do the jump attack that stuns you and allows others to close in
---
indeed. they marketed Fo76 as "play however you like" but conveniently forgot to mention the mmo bs would be shoved down your throat whether you liked it or not.
---
I'm sure things would be different if they advertised properly, like they did with ESO. expectations would be different. a huge chunk of the TES playerbase never touched ESO.
---
I’m on ps4, sorry.
---
Doh just my luck. A most excellent find by the way keep it up friend 🤘
---
My collection of magazines and bobbles :(
---
86 with no bought ones.
---
The ones from the TNT bunkers? Not really, unless someones lazy ig. U can server hop for all the different ones.
---
On a completely unrelated note, I LOVE the 'Mystery meat in a can' that you sell at your camp! I have no idea what's in it but you've got some real cooking talent!
---
It is a nice event but clearly unfinished. Having to listen to Melody Larkin *scream* in your ear everytime about the "***Big Alpha***," that after killing the first two just turns out to be a non-legendary default wolf is both annoying and disappointing. Right now its only good as an easy event/legendary challenge farm, which is a shame for any event.
---
Thanks mate
---
Seconded!  I get BoS is part of the core of Fallout but that faction has never appealed to me in any previous edition, in part just because I've never really been a fan of using power armor and BoS has a sort of a bland 'generic space marine' faction feel to it.  I'd love to see a rebuilding of the order of mysteries as I really liked that story line and kinda rp'd my character's personal story arc.  As it stands much of the content of 76 I pretty much ignore like almost everything dealing with power armor. . haven't even really gone into nuke zones because pa is basically required.  So this is just more content I shrug at and wander off to do my own thing.  Wish they'd spend some time fixing the bugs that have been around since beta.
---
I'm in the high 80s but tempted to buy out the rest just so I don't have to worry about doing chores anymore
---
Level 360 something here. 1.2k hours sunk in game. While I do love the endless grind, and really love diablo 3 and the paragon system. The problem with that over here in fo76 is there are no challenges. The reason for the power creep in d3 is the greater rifts.
---
Fo76 has nothing like that, the game is already a cake walk. Also I feel like a solid 70% of players will never reach the 300 mark to get all the legendary slots unlocked and 99% will never hit the level 1.6k or what ever the fuck it is to max their cards. Especially with all your levels having to be on 1 char. D3 let's paragon points travel across chars
---
I truly think letting you have all legendary cards maxed by level 500 would be good. It would allow for a near endless grind, since the vast majority of players won't make it to 500. But still not drive away your die hard players who are in the game cuz they love it
---
I fin8shed 2 weeks ago and I did not buy one level.
---
Ok my friend was just try to convince me they are
---
&gt;Wastelanders added nothing to the game that isnt already in every fallout game.
---
yeah, that's the point. the Fallout playerbase wants, well, Fallout. not 'baby's first light mmo with mobile time gates everywhere to inconvenience players as much as possible, because we can't come up with actual content since all the competent devs are working on TES and Starfield'.
---
whether the story, lore or quests are good is irrelevant and highly subjective. the point is that a lot of people never wanted Fo76 to be a mmo to begin with. all this stupid busywork does not sit well with the Fallout playerbase and it shows.
---
Not only power armor. I was getting out of power armor and used a worldbench. Same effect. So you must completely free to get the full experience
---
bufftats  have the +40 hp bonus which could set the unyilding threshold bit "off" shaving some of the bonus stats off....
---
thanks for the info!
---
I don’t really run any particular build so I pretty much sell anything I find because I know shit like that is in high demand.
---
Yup it has 140 DR/ER
---
The chicken guild is still accepting applications
---
Same as me. Herbivore and unyielding and a intelligence of 60.
---
480 xp for each super mutant made a huge difference and with 4 lunch boxes I was getting 2500ish xp per super mutant max level.
---
I didn't think the grind was that bad now I know it was down to the build.
---
I think the post I linked said it would be at bare minimum level 700 or so, and more than likelt 800 for most players, with excuses to move stats around and alter the build slightly.
---
And the game might be a cake walk for meta build, like the standard Bloodied character, but not everyone plays a build like that, myself included. My build is in no way shape form or fashion an optimal build, and saying the game is a cakewalk excludes everyone not playing bloodied or junkies.
---
Try to get a full set of Uny armor. Even if theyre 1* equip them till you find a better one or one with more stars. 
---
But once your agility hits the 30 mark youre basically invisible. If you happen to get an Uny + harder  to detect while sneaking armor or Uny + Ap faster Ap refresh armor, youve gotten the best ones possible. And I'd recommend you to get either Secret Service armor if you have the gold and the legendary modules or combat armor. Combat armor is one of the best armors out there.
---
Last 5 levels are 3500 xp per level if I remember rightly.
---
It seems to me that it should work like the terminals at Load Baring, why can’t it just see what I have and it be able to say  that I have 153 rounds of 10mm and ask if I want to trade 150 rounds for x points, and so on with each ammo type. I’d use the converter if it worked like that. Even since the update I still find it too much of a pain to use so it sits in my shop as a convenience for people that stop at my camp and the ammo types I don’t use go in the venders.
---
The problem with bloodied builds is how it stacks with all the other low hp effects. Most other builds have only supportive effects.  
---
  
---
The only way to balance all builds is to add soft and hard caps or restructure some things to have diminishing returns.
---
Maybe go play Eve instead?
---
Well... will do. I may eat people, but a guy still gotta make those caps, right?
---
I usually just spam with a bloodied tesla rifle and take of 75% of their health. Sometimes I accidentally kill them but mistakes happen, amirite?
---
A couple of things on this.  If you have the Green Thumb perk, you really need only one crop item of each type you've planted. Repair 1, harvest 2, repair 2, harvest 4, etc. 
---
If planting outside, you can build a scarecrow away from your crops, with turrets nearby. Enemies will target the scarecrow. You can plant inside with farmable dirt tiles from settlers rep quests, or just build something with no foundations in the center.
---
Awesome thanks for all the info it’s gonna help a ton
---
That was if you got 2 coins per card, I believe right now you get 1 card per coin and they got rid of the cards worth 5 coins. The current system also heavily punishes already high level players since we have lost a lot of duplicate perk cards already.
---
As long as you choose the correct combat perks the game is not hard. You can run aa, instigating, furious, or even slayer weapons and still do fine. As long as you have a halfway decent build you can do the vast majority of pve content with no problem
---
My grasp of fallout lore isn’t great but didn’t the Great War take place on October 22? It’ll probably be linked to that, I expect atom shop bundles and probably random nukes, bigger nuke zones (like the tsar bomb visual bug) or better nuke zone rewards although I’m probably waaay off
---
You wouldn’t happen to have picture of your camp especially the area in question would you?Might be able to get some more help if people can see what your talking about. 
---
 I know in the past iv ran into a similar  issue because i had a second floor and had to remove the whole second floor including the stairs before it would let me.  
---
Iv also had issues where i had to remove a whole row of floors.  Even though the floor i wanted to remove was on the end of the row
---
That happened to me too! I had to move my whole camp just to get rid of it. I was only trying to move them just a tiny bit!. It was really annoying.
---
I find that blueprint budgets are too small to be useful outside of a handful of items.  I wanted to pre-fab something together for a friend who's new to the game and place it in the camp already set up, but I could never get the thing to blueprint.
---
That could be an interesting concept. Like it could be 2 extra mod slots on any weapon even prior legendaries and itd use like legendary modules as the mod recipe and it rolls just like rolling gauss weapons, except since its a mod you cud just remove the mod and reroll another if its one u dont want.
---
Ok. I’ll definitely look into starting a farm. So far I’ve been living off of scrounged canned food and looted purified water
---
So you were walking alone, minding your business, when out of an orange-colored sky, you saw an SB attack? Pretty cool!
---
Level 86 I think. No bought levels. Very minimal outside grinding. Just been doing my dailys and weeklies, skipping nw when they suck
---
Yep, rank 93. Done every challenge every day, minus 3 days that autocompleted. Thankfully those autocompletes weren't weeklies, I don't think.
---
Question is : how much time do tou play eveyday...
---
I have 2 200+ chars, another around 150, and doing dailies for the faction + bog + mire, one westek run for caps, and server hôp vendors for scrip, for all 3 characters, its allready more than 3 hours a day, and still not enough to play some events or doing.more XP runs... And a my levels, I barely take 1 level in like 3 days just from quests. 
---
Not to mention right now that I have to add challenges to that équation
---
Prior to games like ESO and FO76, Ive known many TES and FO fans alike who would have killed for either a coop version, or an mmo styled varient of the franchises. Not every person who plays these series are single play, dial up internet, alone in their bedroom kinda people. Given, neither of their multiplayer attempts in either franchise went according to plan, but they are exactly what many fans had been asking for. Fallout/Elder Scrolls that have multiplayer. And the lovely fact of the matter is, for all those solo artists out there, who DONT want multiplayer versions of their beloved single player franchises, you still have access to them. Its not like the release of ESO/FO76 have removed any of the other titles from people systems. They can still buy, install and lay those games until their hearts content.
---
But instead, there are people out their who just want to try and complain loudly enough, and try to ruin the fun of those who DO want multiplayer versions of their favorite games. They want to complain and bitch and moan and whine that they arent getting what they want, while sitting on multiple copies of exactly what they want, while those who finally DID get what they want are getting trashed and attacked for liking the thing they actually wanted.
---
If your flamer is not explosive you don't want to use a different nozzle they are bugged and will turn your rage to 0
---
Well yes it is but some of us stopped carrying rifles for heavy weapons and miss the pearly peepers we accidentally scraped. Every once in a while I would like to see something in the distance and kick myself for not having anything with a scope on it. Then I remind myself that with my build a sniper rifle weighs a minimum of 10 pounds more than my Gatling gun or my Gatling plasma and so on. After all my .44 pistol weights 7 pounds and my heaviest heavy gun weighs under 3.
---
I meant super fucking high for ‘76
---
What are you talking about?
---
Ya, i mean the process of getting the keys is stupid annoying for some but they dont involve crazy rng like asylum outfits, scout masks or jumpsuits
---
I'm wearing Piper's clothes and is staying
---
Drills are a melee weapon in the game. Every single one I've found so far does 1 damage per tick. However, I've seen videos and photos (and the wiki even states) that drills can have 22 base damage or so. I was wondering how people have managed this (before perks or repairs are taken into account)
---
The problem with these being an “Endless grind” is that they aren’t worth it. You’re already overpowered in FO76 with any decently optimized standard build. Now what, if I level into the thousands I can have a few extra perk cards, or I can pick locks automatically? That stuff is great, but it’s not something anyone is going to pour thousands of hours into grinding for. 
---
A system that ensured that by level 500-600 you’d be able to max every legendary perk card would be fine. There’s still 4 more character slots to level up too—they don’t get all the upgrades automatically. 
---
Want it to be an endless grind? Instead of telling us to grind thousands of levels for a slight upgrade to one card, just keep releasing new ones. Add more card slots for additional levels and so on. That’s a much more interesting way to do this and it creates an ever evolving system that can respond to player feedback.
---
I have 455 and only have 5 strength. So I guess 600 is achievable
---
I love the sound of a nuke going off in the distance. Also, valley galleria's ambient music is at the perfect level that j question whether it's coming from my speakers instead of my headphones
---
If you take a look at the "Inside the Vault" they mentioned in the new PTS will have doubled perk coins. I'm not sure if they doubled from the original 1 coin each, or if they are doubling from the mentioned 2 coins each to a total of 4, but they are testing different amounts of coins to see which they like the most.
---
Considering these are all just PTS runs, and have changed drastically each iteration, we might very well see some major changes after this PTS, another pushback, completely rewarked systems, or even the dreaded removal of the system. Or any other number of options.
---
Stable Flux is used to make Prime receivers for weapons. These are higher damage than regular receivers usually with bonus damage to scorched. It changes ammo type to ultracite. These ammos are also crafted with stable flux plus ultracite scrap, plus the normal ingredients, but in higher quantity per craft.
---
It also is used to make and repair the Decontamination Shower. Setting the perk Contractor reduces the flux needed to build by half. Can store and replace or move camp to fix a broken one without flux use.
---
Also, the better mods for power armor require flux to make. Jetpack and Calibrated Shocks off the top of my head.
---
This would make the grind somewhat reasonable, but have you considered what the effect of perk loadouts will be?
---
First they want you to scrap all excess cards and then after several months (six months?) they will give you option to use those same excess cards in different builds (with same [S.P.E.C.I.A.Ls](https://S.P.E.C.I.A.Ls)). How's that for shitty design 🤦
---
We do not need to scrap excess cards as they have no downside in sitting on your perk pack.
---
What we need is a different system for getting legendary perk points. Maybe every 25 levels you would get another legendary perk level to use, I don't know.
---
There is the issue.
---
"Optimized Standard Build"
---
Something like the meta builds of Bloodied or Junkies? Builds that, more or less, negate the challenge of the game? Not everyone runs those builds, and it shows how disconnected people are to the base game difficulty when they say stuff like 'you're already overpowered"
---
AP refresh isn't an attribute on weapons. but handmades can be enemy drops, and fixers are purveyor only. if you want to get it legit, then you'll be looking for most likely a long long long time. I suggest just trading for one.
---
Assasins rolling pin
---
So it’s basically for late game weapons and tools. I’ll have to see if I did scrap it or not. I think I had some but could be wrong
---
Assaultron liberators
---
You need to use Animal Friend.
---
it's not as simple as that. first, yeah. there are a lot of people who genuinely wanted a TES or Fo mmo. but are they the majority? no, far from it actually.
---
and second, like I mentioned to another user, Bethesda is to blame here for misleading people, advertising Fo76 as 'play however you like' and conveniently forgetting to mention that you'll have to deal with the mmo bs regardless.
---
ESO was advertised as a mmo. period. and so the part of the TES playerbase who disliked mmos never touched it, because it was a mmo and nothing else. it was advertised as such. and the people who did like mmos and embraced ESO for what it was, knew what to expect. they knew how to manage their expectations.
---
this is not the case with Fo76. part of the backlash the game got on release is due to the fact people came in expecting Fo4 with friends, but instead got to micromanage their micromanaging. believe it or not, a lot of people despise mmos. and Fo76 is proof of it.
---
You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defence?
---
I am at rank 90, without xp grind, without bought levels, and I skipped most NW challenges, 1 day autocompleted and 4 day holiday break.
---
Great info. Wondering if you join teams and run inspirational as well. Also why running 2 location then server jump is slower compared to 1? It’s just a 2 loading screen difference minus rejoining team time and server hopping time. How much slower would I be?
---
Support builds can be very fulfilling to play during the new events
---
If we could sort by TOTAL WEIGHT, that’s solve like 2/3 of the inventory management issue for me.  
---
I also think stash mods would be an awesome thing to have. Possibly another thing we could spend bullion on. “Reduces the weight of stored weapons by 20%”, “increases your storage capacity by 200”, etc.  
---
I’d also love if they made stashes account-wide. Maybe increase the storage space to 1600 to compensate for the total net loss players who have bank alts would suffer. Wouldn’t even be mad if this was a FO1st feature.  
---
But what do I know. I just play the game.
---
I don't think stable flux can be scrapped. It's fairly heavy, so you could have dropped it. Sells well to other players if you decide you don't need it.
---
If you have the FO1st scrap box, it would have auto stored.
---
I used wasteland whisperer on a deathclaw. The bar when to yellow instead of red and it didn't attack me. It's neutral for a bit and then goes back to red giving me the option to pacify it once more.
---
i don’t know what that is, sorry.
---
Yes, i guess beth downgraded AWS servers to save some money.
---
Well, exploiters gonna exploit. What does it matter if they fucked themselves out of the precious "grind experience". The system is still bullshit and you and your buddies still don't matter in the grand scheme of things.
---
I am level 471. There is absolutely no fucking reason- none- that I should have to level up 1000 more levels to fully rank up my legendary perk cards. 
---
&gt; I am in the same boat. I havent toched this game properly since before wastlanders. 
---
I have played the game consistency since beta with no real breaks.   It has been a long and tedious slog.  It's time for  the big payoff,  not another s long,  excruciating, boring and meaningless grind. 
---
&gt; With nothing left to do, and no further rewards to obtain, there is no further reason to continue to play 
---
Yes there is. 
---
IT'S CALLED NEW CONTENT.  
---
New, more challenging content where the legendary perks give you a much needed edge because the new content is, you know,   challenging. 
---
Using legendary perks as an excuse to   dump players into yet another endless grind is a phony cheap and transparently lazy way to keep players playing the game. 
---
All MMOs do this you say? See previous paragraph. The aforementioned adjectives describe most MMOs and their tactics to keep players running on an endless and empty treadmill that goes nowhere.  So what?
---
Sometimes if you walk away and return the corpses pop back up. You can also sometimes loot the 'nothing' where the corpse should be. Finding bots after Thier explosion can sometimes be difficult though.
---
That just makes them not attack you. To tame you need max animal friend and a creature at a specific spawn area.
---
Go for the legs! They fall over pretty easily.  
---
Still fricking annoying though.
---
I'm pretty sure it's one of the drill mods
---
Your welcome. You can also try generals steak house, robco research center, the whitesprings area including the golf club. Forgot They have  a decent chances to spawn legendary enemies as well.
---
With my instigating pump action, I can usually one shot then when I go for the torso. It’s just getting to them before they go chameleon and get that laserbeam going
---
No it’s just that the explosive effect usually doesn’t work outside of vats. I shoot them and their health goes down but then spikes back up again
---
The minimum we could expect from any MMO introducing that kind of system would be to implement a respec system.... Just to solve the problem of players who used points to respec when the rule was not the same.
---
And to speak about this system by itself, it would be OKish if players didnt need SUPPORT perks... They introduced a Legendary that let you scrap Hackers and picklock skills, which is fine, but we still need to keep an équivalent of 10 legendary perk points to mod a power fist, 6 other to mod a ballistic Heavy Gun and 6 more to mod an Énergy Heavy weapon. And I dont even speak about armour and power armor.
---
Thats a quarter of a legendary perk you cant get if you add everything.
---
Not to mention either People that prefers having 3 150\200 characters with different playstyle, than 1 500 character. Because that Kind of player often dont get the time to level up alot as they allready need alot of playtime to farm gold, scrip and caps.
---
So yeah, once again, this system will penalize build diversity, and weapon viability, and once again, Bethesda leads to the same exact gameplay for everyone.
---
Solutions ? At the bare minimum, free first respec + payed respec after that, for perks AND legendary perks (cause imagine you choose your legendary perks badly cause you cant test, its lost). Legendary perk points shared between all the characters of an account and/or shared stash and/or shared support perks, so that you can level a Smith mule that can do all the modding for all your characters and so on.
---
It's even better when you step out of the armor and just get score after score after score.  Uuuuuuhhhh, HOOK IT TO MY VEINS!
---
Biggest rule out there in the wasteland? Always, ALWAYS take a drink from the punch bowl if someone has one in their camp. Common courtesy, yada yada yada, take a sip of punch. Trust me, its always worth it
---
The most important thing for the over-all health of the game would be not to rely on XP/leveling as a daily and repeatable challenge respectively, because it leads to a lot of toxicity at events between the people who want to farm XP and the people who actually want to complete the events.
---
Less FOMO and pressure to play every day. Communicate clearly and up-front any bonus events you're planning. Balance the whole thing so that there is at least a week of slack included because people do have lives outside the game. More emphasis on weekly as opposed to daily challenges would also be welcome in that context. Take off the effing pressure already because the current state of affairs is not sustainable long-term.
---
Anything else, apart from the bugs like challenges auto-completing, really kinda pales in significance compared to that.
---
What about a salt mine for lvl 75+?
---
It amazes me how many people don’t know this.
---
Shotguns are always a good option heh
---
Are you guys looking for a  sniper right now? That's what my main character does.
---
Umm, what glitch? ...asking for a friend.
---
I run vamps 95% of the time and still breeze threw everything. You just have to have your build down. Using pistols and melee as well as a bunch of qol perks? Yeah you're gunnu feel the pain. But if you have half a clue about making a proper build you can do anything in the game
---
Any FPS I’ve played, I usually try and run shotguns. I just like being up in the face of the enemy turning them into hamburger meat... this game, I’ve actually gotten into sneaking and stealthing around.... that’s the best way to take out the assaultrons if they don’t see you coming
---
I was always a run in, guns a blazing type of player
---
There was also a much easier way. You used to be able to just drop it. Since you were dropping the frame not the pa. They would then crash the servers so both people would have a set.
---
I was recently shocked to find I had accrued 800 Radaway and over 400 Radaway Diluted. I'm making my 1400 caps each day whittling that down.
---
They both have the same definition under the perk. I figured one was for animals (Fox, beaver, etc) and one for creatures (mirelurks, radscorpions, etc)
---
They doubled the perk coin income starting with tomorrows pts.
---
So it's now 750 lvls plus however many lvls you need for your build perks yo max all 6 slots which is a major improvement imo and that post you reference doesn't reflect this. 
---
Getting that first slot maxed around lvl 200 assuming 75 levels for build perks plus crafting and utility doesn't seem horrible to me. 
---
The main thing the system is rough on is players with multiple characters.   Getting a single toon to 850ish is at least feasible with the new xp bonuses from lunchboxes and public teams.  But getting 5 that high is another story.
---
The more I hear about One Wasteland, the more I feel like bracing for the worst. 
---
So if I'm on my level 120 and my friend is on his level 3 and we both start attacking a scorched... my friend will see the scorched as level 10 but I'll see it as level 52.
---
So there I am, with my hard earned 3 star handmade with exploding rounds, and he's beside me with a level 1 pipe pistol. 
---
My gun puts level 50+ down in 2 shots.
---
His gun takes 2 full magazines to put a level 10 down. 
---
So there I am *Still* mopping the floor with everything before he even has a chance to make a dent? Or is he doing the same amount of damage now, thereby making my grind for a 3 star pointless? 
---
Either way, it doesn't sound like a fun experience for either player. 
---
This change just confuses me. Was it a pain running into something way out of your level when you needed to get a mission done? Yes, but that was also part of the experience. Changing gears and doing something else for a bit until you were strong enough to come back. There are so many side missions and branching stories that it actually *helped* to keep me from steamrolling the main story missions, as I'd have to take a break and level up doing events or exploring again first. 
---
Now I can exit the vault and just start trucking without ever stopping, because enemies will always be at an appropriate level. 
---
I can see how this sounds good 'on paper' but I'm unable to see how this will be fun at all.
---
I don't know anyone that has one. More is the pity.
---
I did the same. And while I wouldn't say it was amazing. It was a'ight. Now it's pretty much garbage though haha
---
Thanks, Holistic, for the advice.
---
Pretty much any game I tend to go rifle, pistol, shotty. Shotty comes out when I get angry lol
---
So, how does that work.
---
Let's say I go to Vault 76 and a level 1 steps outside.
---
We both turn right and go over to the low level liberators.
---
(we aren't in a group btw)
---
I see max level he sees min level.
---
How does that work?  My view of the target has a HUGE health pool and the same target for him has a comparatively small health pool.
---
I don't get how that can work?
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
I’ll add you tomorrow
---
I did, too. I asked someone this same question. Lol.
---
But, yeah, AF at max and a specific spawn point.  I just got a sloth at the lookout tower by vault 95...97? Toward the top right corner of the map.
---
Oh I’m not knocking it, I’m just saying most people wouldn’t care to go through all that work for 3min of a fight. I’ve got an AASS DCG and one shot literally everything but SBQ &amp; WC. I’ve been trying to get an unstoppable monster or other bloodied DCG, but no luck
---
You don’t see the events until you are a member.
---
I've been wanting this as well. Make it a skin, "Chameleon". At least that way it'd have more of an in-universe explanation, as opposed to being able to put on some clothes and instantly slim down your huge, bulky armor set.
---
I can recommend a chain saw tbh. With the flame mod and the long bar.  It's a great melee for just having fun. And it's very nice on the queenie, also if your a tank build she's attracted to melee .
---
Oh ok thank you for letting me know
---
They pop up fairly regularly once you've got to the appropriate point in the quest line and thereafter.
---
In the Mire and Cranberry Bog. Hover over any event without the ! Mark and it will say in huge letters Enclave event. If it is one of not it will be a normal event like messenger /distant thunder etc.
---

---
Last year, the honeybees would glitch out and spawn endless amounts of bee swarms. If you threw a grenade would probably get around 2k exp. It's not something you can jusy trigger tho just random.
---
Appreciate it.
---
That's better, but even level 800 is out of reach for 99% of the player base. I have seen like 2 level 800 players in my time. I've spent almost 2 years and a lot of grinding to hit level 360. I doubt I will ever hit level 800
---
People want to grind, but they also want what they're grinding for to be obtainable. Level 800, hell even level 500 is just to far out of reach for most players. And seeing that grind will drive people away. Especially with how little end game content and end game grind farms there are
---
Good on ya! I've had that goal but never taken more than 13 at once. By the time you're approaching 10 the defense and retake start to really kick in, but it is a ton of fun and decent source of non-stop events, water, mats, and XP.
---
Early on in development they planned the scorch beast to be a bird not a bad, this came as far as a model that we have had in the files since release of this beta version of the scorch beast. I'm not talking about lore I'm talking about development history, ask any dataminer, this is all true.
---
Not to scare our new player friend here, I got to say you’ve been very lucky. I have 1800+ hours played and I’ve been attacked in workshops so many times. I don’t contest the workshop I just leave to make it clear that I don’t want PvP and have been chased all the way from Hemlock Holes to Grafton. I got killed at least 3 times that time because you can’t fast travel away when you’re in active PvP. I’ve had people leave my loot lying where it dropped so they could kill me again if I came back for it. But now that I think about it all that was before Wastelanders and Beth really has changed things to help prevent the griefers, so new players shouldn’t have to worry about people like that.
---
If I see someone in my Bush I don't engage. I just hope they are peaceful or they don't see me
---
It's not relevant. So stop.
---
Yup that’s a nuke silo/bunker.
---
And mind you, that's not the OG concept by Bethesda.
---
You can now get Fixers, and other plan only weapons, from event drops as well. Like how the Queen puts a random legendary into your inventory, or how fasnacht did it
---
It can kill the scorched before a player can and you miss out in xp.
---
You don't want to respec, as it will cripple your ability to rank up legendary perks.
---
At level 360 I finally got my first bloodied fixer, it's just a 1* though haha. Thankfully I was able to snag a bloodied ffr 25lvc fixer for cheap during the dupe wave
---
I sell absolutely everything at 10% of face value, I like seeing a level 11 pick up a cheap legendary pipe pistol for a handful of caps, but I also see a lot of level 200s swinging by and clearing me out of low level gear, which I guess must be for reselling.
---
Looking to get banned?
---
I price my plans at 10% of the listed value and that seems to be a good price, if something doesn’t sell you can alway lower the price.
---
They will probably have their own quest line. I can't see them changing the wasetlanders story like that
---
"Born under a bad sign" definitely belongs too
---
Interesting but I mean we don't know what to do like we can't figure out anything to do
---
🙄
---
Well the question is, what do you enjoy from a game?
---
Some people like the ability to one punch everything - it makes them feel godlike.
---
Others like the survival feel of being down to their last few bullets.
---
Some like the challenge of every enemy being a threat.
---
If you dont like the enemies becoming trivially easy to kill, then dont run a build that makes them trivially easy.
---
My favourite build for challenging was power armour fight club - unarmed in power armour, so literally just punching with fists. It made all enemies actually a credible threat
---
Constantly no, but at least once for play session.  
---
I've ironed almost everything out, with two possible culprits: iCue (yeah i know right) and a skin i'm using for TeamSpeak.  
---
Closing the two, or either one of them, solves the problem. Go figure.
---
Fasnacht collectron would like a word.
---
Came across a dude at Faschnat right after the stackables dupe. He was trying to see 3 million 50 Cal for 2 caps a piece. Some people have no shame.
---
Oh yeah, what's the reason of the question tho? My friend did it completely legit and i'm only 10 marks away from completing it.  
---
And mind you i'm a 13h/6days worker, with just a few hours to play each day if i'm lucky.
---
Finished it 3 days ago, no bought levels.
---
I keep seeing people saying that nuking the burrows turns all the ghouls into glowing ghouls but I tried it and it did not did I do something wrong?
---
Raiders sing songs around the Tinkerer's Workbench about this chicken
---
Those who really got on grinding it finished like in 3-4 weeks. I'm at rank 86 by playing normally every day and doing every daily/weekly (except most of the time consuming NW ones).
---
Lost a wendigo for violent night. Tagged it, and it flew into the air when it died. Bunch of folks seemed to be able to loot it when it landed  but there was just nothing there on my screen.
---
All in total, I spent about 1k caps on fast travelling and claiming. The server I was on began shutdown just as I claimed the last one, so nobody really wanted to take one for themselves. Honestly, just being able to say you did it is rewarding enough.
---
They're an odd case. They only spawn in a bunker as far as Im aware. The process of getting the keys to the bunker is slightly long winded, and not too obvious. If you know about it, there are lots of easy to follow guides online. If you dont know about it, you might not stumble upon it.
---
However once you have the keys, you can pretty much get as many as you want (also the T51-b paint).
---
They're uncommon enough to sell for some caps in a vendor, but nowhere near the value of an actual "rare" outfit.
---
Been playing for some time now. Probably close to 500 levels split between 3 characters. 
---
A few tips i wish i had learned. Super duper in the luck tree and ammosmith in the agility are any gun users best friend. Once you hit level 50 and flesh out your build. Max these asap and equip them when crafting ammo. Ammo will double your ammo and super duper gives the random chance to craft double the ammo for the cost of one. Super duper also works for anything you craft except the stuff that uses legendary modules. 
---
Ammo is decent cap maker  in your vending machine 5.56, .45, .308, .50 cal are super in demand and not hard to come by. Fusion cells and plasma cartridges still move just not as well. Any unused ammo dump it in your vending machine.  Only sell them for 1 cap each. Most players won’t buy ammo if its over 1cap. 
---
Definitely research what rare items are in the game. I learned this too late. Starting out i sold things for dirty cheap and only came to realize later how much i messed up.  Some items players will pay huge amount of caps for/ you can trade for things you want. Like certain plans people will easily trade legendary weapons for. So do your research and don’t get screwed. Also helps to avoid overpaying for things people think are rare and shove in their shops.  
---
for quick caps find a nice farming spot. Grafton for low level players. blackwater mine for mid to high level. Kill and loot everything in these areas. Go sell that stuff to a vendor. Do this a few times by changing servers and you can easily get your 1400 daily caps in less then 20 minutes 
---
Also take into account each character has a max cap level of 30,000. So keep an eye on how many caps you have. Each character can only hold 30,000 at a time. When you get close to that remove your vending machines. Don’t hide them behind doors or remove the power. Players can and will get to them. They are still usable without power. When you hit max caps and a player buys something you get no profits from the sale. 
---
you can get weapons plans for cheap at player vendors. May require some effort on your part but It never occurred to me when i was starting out to check them. I figured if the train station vendor was selling a lever action plan for 1500 then players would be as well. some players sell them dirt cheap. Iv seen that same plan for less then 500 while shopping. 
---
Finally Too many YouTube channels and people on social media  love to tell you any build that isn’t a junkies or bloodied build isn’t viable for end game. Thats the complete opposite. Any build is viable with the right weapons. Just enjoy yourself especially if your new to the game. Wanna be a gunslinger? Do it. Wanna carry enough heavy weapons to make megatron jealous? Do it. Wanna play as a big bearded guy in a dress and beat up ghouls with a rolling pin? Do it. Just enjoy yourself.

And while we are at it, I don't need to hear "Yous no flake, I'm impressed" from Rocksy every single time when I've been actively murdering cunts for her since months. Literally months.

Wren, for some weird reason, gives me no issues whatsoever. I go there, get the quest, get her crap, return, turn it in, done.

How the fuck did he store all of that in his stash?? For comparison: 10K 556 ammo equals 10 weight and thats definitely more than he should be able to put in vendors/stash
---
That's relative to the time period. The original Brotherhood of Steel wasn't nearly so conservative, obsessed with technology, or generally cult-ish. They had become more isolationist by FO1, but even so, they were a far cry from the West Coast Brotherhood circa New Vegas.
---
Half the time I log in my jetpack is invisible anyway

it doesn't. separate interiors locations that require loading do not get affected.

Good deal in the shotgun. You got ripped off on the pies though
---
This is probably the best comment and I agree with all of it
---
Nope, I'm allowed to be curious
---
I read from the Taiwanese forum, people have face the same bug in Chinese version too, and this solution works for them, not sure if it is all, but people posted they could get the quest done with this solution.
---
In short:
---
1. Restart the game
---
2. Install the blood (if no more, jump to 3.)
---
3. Use the computer to analyse
---
4. Install the fuse
---
If doesn't work, it could relate to 1., try servers hop, or best to do it in Private server if you have Fallout 1st.
---
Good luck.
---
How much for the pies?
---
Purist: While unmutated weapons get +50% damage and maybe an armor set that gives +1 to all stats.
---
you can get both
---
Thanks for explaining.
---
I think your second paragraph is dead on.
---
Ironically, you're the only elitist snob I've seen so far. Also, what is up with those quotations? Please don't respond, I actually do not wan't to hear your reasoning. I assume it would just be more baseless insults and odd misquotations.
---
"How" dare I have "differences o"f opinion! I shall call you out on Reddit!"
---
Tbh I feel bad for being a bush wookie, only doing NW for the daily challenges. I don't like to interfere with others who like to actually play the mode as intended so I stick to a bush, afk until its time to move closer or suicide if I've done my challanges. I get to top 10 regularly doing this and it does feel scummy. If it wasn't for S.C.O.R.E I wouldn't do it at all, but it's the easiest way to get them done.
---
It’s a visual glitch, happened to me few times.  Friend of mine had over 400 mil fusion cores in his inventory...lol
---
You killed it, you mad lad. Have you never played skyrim?
---
I do it whenever I see it. And I'm usually the only on on the server who goes for it.
---
creating towns by putting camps together was part of the games marketing, and a boomer i play with has the actual prima official fallout 76 guide, which says to build towns by putting camps together
---
if this engine wasnt extremely inefficient due to all the redundant spaghetti coding creating loops of pointless referencing, we could have amazing building projects
---
So, let's see the good things first:
---
* XP Gains now are fine, so are the points as a reward for each daily you do
---
* Rewards to unlock are ok-ish and meh-ish at the same time. It keeps you coming back because at least for me the sense of progression works well
---
What i would change:
---
* Some rewards needs to be exclusive, and/or unlocked after 6 months in the shop
---
* Some rewards needs to be a bit more "worth"; weapon skin, cooler PAs skins, more bullions and atoms, repair kits
---
* Exclusive and worth items for camp (or vanity) is what boosted me do run thru the first 10 levels of the Run because i found them usefull for my daily routines
---
* NW challenges needs to go. Or at least, separate them from standard pve world. In this way you can even put 2, 3 of them in NW for those hardcore players of the mode. Obviously another daily challenge in PVE world should take the spot of the missing NW challenge
---
* Some daily challenges are ok, some not. Same for weeklies. In the end we do them in a very short time (usually in my 2 hours of gaming, including weeklies), but some variety would be cool, with lenghty objectives maybe? Even a replayable story mission, with higher reward. Also the side effect to complete them fast is that all i'm left to do is grinding the usual stuff, and once we got maxed out rep for both factions, things wear out FAST. Why not putting a "Kill the queen" "Kill the Wendigo Colossus (the event)" or "Complete the Raid" each week with a bigger Score points reward? That would incentivate people to nuke and do server wide events that anyone can appreciate and take part imho.

* Enable other vendors/NPC to give you a weekly or daily quest. Such Duchess from Wayward (or Polly? Polly is great! So much unused potential), nothing too complicated, like "go there, kill this, or fetch this". It will promote interaction with NPCs like we do with the hateful Ward or Wren.Another NPC up to the task could be the guy in the Wayward that helps you out building a camp; maybe he can request to build something in a workshop or in your camp? What about Smiley? Besides selling blackmarket Bullions, he could give you a fetch quest with a payout of 20 bullions each week. No? I can go on and on with examples but what i feel is that we need a bit more of interactions with NPCs. Hell even Rose could be useful! She's great.
---
That's what i want to see. Oh, before i forget: raise a bit the cap of Scrips and Caps daily. I see alot of suggestions around, both most of them are too extreme from a business perspective. Give too much to the people, and they will obliterate the content, am i right?So my proposal is this:
---
* Raise the Scrips to 250
---
* Raise the daily caps to 1800 or 2000
---
* Raise the redeemable bullions to 250
---
That would be cool. EDIT: formatting
---
no one can accurately convince you of the magic that is bloodied commando. you have to experience it for yourself.
---
IT JUST WORKS
---
I can forgive Sweetwater because his line about guest attire rules. Ward however is bordering on rage inducing. He's completely broken and I swear that the devs leave him in this brain worm state out of spite.
---
 I do like to see all this hate for the BOS specially from the Enclave  guys, don't you guys have a vault full of people to murder (vault 13) or a entire state to poison with FEV (capital wasteland)? "aH aH ThE bOs ArE  DiCk aNd ThEy FaIlEd tHeIr MiSsIoN hUe HuE" Did the BOS frell up? Oh yes, but every single faction in  FO76 messed up in epic proportion but BOS is the only one to take the hate because bethesda keeps making them shit (well also by the time of fo4 BOS is the only one we know that still exists) . After the BOS got wiped the  Responders got wiped in hours and we can still hear their the cries for help, The Enclave well they wiped themselves out (bravo), The Order Of Mysteries was betrayed because one of the older members as "dancing the horizontal  mambo" with a raider, The Free "paranoid" states honestly I forgot half there story but I remember something about they getting infected but the plague and since there is no bodies in the bunkers they are most likely the scorche I have been killing in that area (oops sorry) and the Raiders.. well take a guess about their fate. so please get of your high horse and stop being a jack ass.
---
You can get both. The real question is do you use heavys or shotguns
---
Did you do private or public server? Thought about doing it myself.
---
You can get both weapons you just need to grind the reputation. I'd suggest you to do all the settler quests and then side with the raiders. If you do so and do it correctly you should get a free Chinese stealth suit which is definitely worth it. In the end you can buy everything with gold-bullions tho. Its just annoying because you first have to get max reputation with both factions to buy the plans for either gauss-minigun or gauss-shotgun. 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong
---
No, you only get nocturnal rolling pins from buying it with scrip.
---
Last week I spent 300 scrip to see if I could get a good melee weapon. I got a hatchet, a golf club and a switchblade. Nothing cool on stats, either. Not bloodied or anti-armor even. It was just sad.
---
Hey I responded, are you upset?
---
I seem to be unable to do the Raider Retirement plan Daily recently.
---
First let us have “cube” building areas instead of “sphere” ones, this would already help.
---
Yeah I already got the Chinese suit and currently think on whom but yeah I’ll take your world and side with raiders. Another question after I side with raiders can I still do daily’s for settlers in still pretty new :/
---
i think the important part is having the pet respawn or be unkillable
---
it is such a chore to get the pet you want, for a strong chance of it running off and dying somewhere or just disappearing
---
I had 2 Fixer during the Fashnart event, maybe you will have some during the meat week.
---
Quick call it and lets find out!
---
Yes you can.
---
Better have enough caps to buy them all
---
Not a meta build. Just a build—heavy gunner, stealth commando etc. You don’t need to be a meta build to breeze through most of the game at high levels—and that’s who is getting legendary perks. By the time someone is level 300+ (required to open all the perk slots) there’s no way they don’t have a decent selection of legendary weapons on top of all that. 
---
I don’t think they’re far away from where they should be for coins/upgrade costs, but they do need to drop the cost in addition to the boost in value. Nobody is going to grind for thousands of levels to have a slightly higher chance to make a corpse explode. 
---
I’m all for an endless progression system, but this alone isn’t it. Releasing new legendary perks and level requirements to unlock additional card slots is the ticket. That’ll keep people engaged and let them feel that progression. Grinding for 300 high levels to be able to have a slightly more effective version of any of these perks isn’t going to feel rewarding.
---
fixers/handmades have a bigger range than shotguns with no damage drop off, and a very small AP cost to shoot in vats so you can spam more sneak crits
---
i play both builds on different characters and the bloody stealth commando, with gun fu is stupid you vats one enemies head and then just keep shooting and it auto aimbots every enemies head in render distance to one shot them all with 95% hit chance  
---
its also nicer for dealing with scorchbeasts because you take them out of the air faster than shotguns which do nerfed damage at that distance
---
I finished the run a few days ago. No atoms spent, just a lot of no lifeing
---
Not all just want to grab a small stock to put in stash haha
---
You can grind for both raider and settler rep after you finish the story. Your not locked out of any of the rewards. Personally I prefer the gauss minigun its a monster but its an ammo hog. The gauss shotgun is just as good and better on ammo. So it really comes down to preference. I personally would side with the settlers for the extra rep you get along the way. Raiders have four daily grind missions. Five if you turn in photos to them. The settlers only have one daily mission plus the photo opportunity. So grinding rep out for them isn’t as long as settlers. 
---
Also incase you didn’t know finish missions for both sides up to the point you raid the vault. Then choose a side. otherwise you miss out on some unique rewards and don’t get the Chinese stealth armor for free. So definitely get the stealth armor for free. Even if you don’t want to use it. Its an insane amount of gold if you decide you want it later on.
---
Its about 4m pounds of ammo. Has to be cheating. The max I could store my ammo above the 800 limit us by 10 pounds. After 10 pounds the game just says no.
---
The whitespring
---
Tried the location near Pleasant Valley Train Station?
---
I got them by scrapping every flamer i came across.
---
If you aren’t just being sarcastic, Eve is commonly regarded as the game for market manipulation and trading.  It’s ostensibly a space ship combat game.
---
It’s not big enough for both of us🙁
---
Yes you can do Vital Equipment every 20 hours. And if you're interested I can show you a small *glitch* to get the settler reputation maxed withing like 2 hours.
---
Nope I genuinely didn’t know lol
---
I’ll cheers to that.
---
Cutting the face off and making it fit is harder.  wait, what?
---
Another option is in the Forest, around Lakebed.
---
So yeah it seems I thought I was getting a great deal but in fact I was getting ripped off 😂
---
I think cube builds and close camps would go hand and hand my 300% built house would look funny with a lil dinky tunnel running off the back to another build maybe just closer not next to
---
I downvote the shit out of that feel-good content. It doesn't add anything to the discussion and certainly doesn't improve the game. That's the kind of stuff that you should keep to yourself, not post for easy karma.
---
Oh is there actually water there??? That would be perfect if so
---
Why does everyone want a nerf for bloodied builds? Also nerfing the perk cards is ridiculous, let us have our fun putting out huge damage and dying easily.
---
Near vault 76 if you go down to that farm. My camps there and its basically flat. There is a tractor but thats not gonna get in your way
---
What? They were working with the Responders about the Scorched until their relationship broke down over disagreements over resources.
---
Only problem with that would be constantly server hopping because someone already has a camp there
---
I remember my first encounter with a legendary one,(lvl 68),when i was lvl 34. The incoming beams gave me ptsd
---
Op got my map knowledge wrong.  That's in Toxic Valley.  But the Toxic Valley in general is mainly flat and does have a lot of water.  Not sure if Water Purifiers will work though.
---
I still get people thinking the Stranger Bloom comes from random server seed or completing Heart of the Swamp at Night while wearing a clown outfit.
---
This is, by far, one of the best replies I've read on here in a long time and it mirrors mine pretty much 1:1
---
Anyone who's defending the insulting design decisions in this game is lying to themselves. None of this engaging or fun. It's just tedious grind.
---
My ‘Digger’ from the final wastelanders quest was legendary. I have no proof, because I didn’t think it was that rare, but you don’t have to believe me. I know I’m right and that’s all that matters
---
Level 95, no bought level. some grinding needed to get the level up everyday.
---
Use diluted versions, as they have near to less  impact on mutations. Also they weight less and you can sell the "normal versions" for caps at the vendors.
---
Do you want to spend a good chunk of your time making or buying ammo? Then get the minigun
---
Do you want to miss an enemy 1 foot in front of you with 95% chance but kill one behind a tree on the other side of the map with 0% chance? Shotgun it is. Do you want to one shot a level 91 deathclaw but then take 3 shots to kill a level 32 ant? SHOTGUN! 
---
Want to someone bow yourself up because why not? SHOTGUNNNNN
---
Basically.. go shotgun
---
That's ridiculous. You make it sound like the Brotherhood were fighting a war unrelated to the Responders or the Free States instead of a common enemy. Do you think it's a coincidence that the other groups got wiped out as soon as the Brotherhood wasn't there as a bulwark?
---
We still haven't wiped out the Scorched, and the progress we made has been by utilizing nuclear weapons that the Brotherhood was forbidden (because of the whole "nuclear holocaust" thing that happened).
---
That's true, however, from the holotapes in FO76, it seems that Roger Maxon's ideals are similar to Lyons, namely recruiting from and working with outsiders and protecting civilization (including people outside the Brotherhood). It was his son and other high-ranking members that turned the BoS into the faction we know from FO1, 2, and 4. 
---
So, it remains to be seen whether the BoS coming to Appalachia will follow Roger Maxon's ideals or those of the now quiet majority.
---
I believe it's through Bethesda launcher
---
I'ts possible to have 4 Star Legendary Weapon : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtjfQOEoZ-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtjfQOEoZ-I)
---
They should also fix a lot of other stuff too
---
Server Not Responding
---
Controls have been temporarily disabled
---
Wait wat even if it’s underground?
---
I played the event several times and can confirm that you will indeed have an incredibly hard time without a meta player or without magic weapons. 
---
Add to that the instanced to 8 players stupidity and you might end up in a group of low level randos who simply lack the firepower to tackle the adds, let alone Earle.
---
I can't wait for it to go live because if this isn't balanced we'll be having a field day on here.
---
If you hide generators, collectrons or turrets. He won't be aggressive to them.  Just keep them away from where he walks.
---
lake eloise 
---
south edge of the map near the picture of the bear on the world map. used to be the meta place for group builds
---
No, One Tamriel killed ESO...One look at their forum will tell you all you need to know about One Tamriel
---
If you go with mutations most people run with starched genes 2 and class freak 3 to get the best out of them. 
---
Marsupial will let you leap like a majestic salmon. Herd mentality gives a boost to all specials when in a party (even if you're by yourself) so you can use something else other than lone wanderer. Empath works the same. You take more damage but you also take less damage. Speed demon lets you reload and move faster. Egg head gives up to +8 INT. 
---
I sell them all for 250 each on xbone if you want to dabble.
---
Flux pickled cranberries. Yes.
---
thank you!
---
yeah i found that out haha
---
lol ironically man, I went sniper with the first character I made like I said completely new,  but I've followed this game since launch waiting for it to get better, then finally a chance presented itself and I got it super cheap. The moment I realized my sniper class would be ok, I was walking around at level 26, sneaking, and see a super mutant, level 65 1 star legendary... I figure holy shit I'm to weak, tried asking a few people to help to no avail...finally I decide to pull the trigger, one shot it...dont know how, don't know why, but I did. It was at that moment I stopped doubting my char.
---
Say no more 
---
I really like your comment good shit
---
I really want to play NW for the power armor skins but it takes way too long to join and start a game. I actually won once by hiding until the very end and then popping out and killing the last person while they were fighting a scorchbeast. Was scummy but amusing.
---
👌 teach me your ways
---
Show me one instance of the the WV Brotherhood wrongfully killing anyone to steal their possessions. 
---
The Brotherhood insisted on receiving supplies because they were using those supplies to fight the Scorched that were trying to - and eventually did - murder everyone. They were dealing with the bulk of Scorched aggression so that the other factions didn't have to. Comparing them to the Raiders is either disingenuous or ignorant.
---
Were they flawed? Of course; all of the factions were. A series of minor betrayals instilled a mistrust of outsiders in the Brotherhood, and they didn't trust the Responders or the Free States as well as they should. But at the end of the day, the Brotherhood were the ones actually fighting the Scorched, and they died trying to give others a chance to live.
---
Imo real question is do you want to farm expensive ass ammo? Y=minigun N= shotgun
---
I'm a heavy gunner and I just use the shotgun lol
---
I have a gauss mini for fun tho
---
Following the Brotherhoods story in 76 taught me that they used nuclear weaponry in a pointless endeavour. They were ordered directly not to deploy the nuclear arsenal against the Scorchbeasts and ignored it. West Virginia was relatively untouched by the war and there at one time a real opportunity to rebuild and grow and yet the Brotherhood made the same decision as Eckhart in his bunker to gain control of the silos and use the nuclear devices. 
---
In fact I would argue that the Brotherhood were just as bad, if not worse, than the Enclave. Yes the Enclave released the Scorchbeasts in the first place just so they could launch on China, but the Brotherhood in West Virginia used nuclear weapons upon their own home despite not knowing if the plan would even work in the first place. I can not stress enough how lasting radiation and toxicity are. 
---
Fallout 3 isn't just tinted green as an aesthetic choice, radiation burns the very air. The meltdown at Chernobyl made the sky light up as if it was day time. It's why the Glow exists in Fallout 4. 
---
The Brotherhood, more than any other faction, spoiled the last opportunity for humanity to get past the War. The Scorchbeasts could have been dealt with another way.
---
And yet one of the most popular games of all time is eityher considered to be WoW or GTA, and I can almost, 100% promise you GTA isnt popular due to its stale and dead single player.
---
There is a lot to gaming communities in general, and generalizing it is a bad idea.
---
As to the 'play however you like' its still true. You can play however you like, within the confines of the game of course. Explore and quest? Sure. Fight and loot? Go for it. Build and design? Why not.
---
Nice build, might go similar once I grinded enough rep for the gauss
---
how do you tame a death claw.....
---
Bethesda, stop making these sock puppet accounts where you pose as real players making excuses for your execrable game design choices.   No one who actually plays the game thinks that this legendary perk system grind is anything other than excruciatingly awful.  You can fix it or release  this horrific mess as is and lose a huge chunk of your player base.  Your move.
---
[meanwhile, in Skyrim...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/91h39h/chickens_are_sacred_animals_in_skyrim/)
---
Why are the pearly peepers so highly valued. I sold mine at a vendor not long after I received them.
---
love that you asked this question and the bethesda rep noped right the fuck out.
---
Thank you so much for this post.
---
It would be nice if more members of the community had the clarity to know what is a bug, what isn't a bug and what is bugged because it is missing *(SS mods)*. They never will because the in-game and official documentation on 'what is in the game' is so barren. *(mods/plans/recipes)*
---
You can nuke the surface and the ghouls in the burrows become glowing ghouls. It used to be legendary heaven but I think they was nerfed. Either way it's still fun. And you don't receive rad damage under it!
---
I used to nuke burrows more than silos just for the hoard feel.
---
Go and install the perk mod and all your dreams will come true.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
I think, my only suggestion, would be if the whole perk system was account wide. That way, every character played would work towards that goal. Kinda like the CP in ESO. It takes a while to earn max CP in that game, but any character that hits max level adds a little bit to the pot every time they are played.
---
"Under the pretense"? What, do you think they weren't really using those supplies to fight the Scorched? They died to a man fighting them.
---
Should the Brotherhood have cooperated better with the other factions? Yes. Should they have shown more trust to outsiders? Sure. But at the end of the day, only one faction was really fighting the Scorched, and they demonstrably needed supplies to do that.
---
It's not a coincidence that the Scorched flooded Appalachia as soon as the Brotherhood was no longer there to contain them.
---
Right, the Load Baring terminals are a decent model, forgot about those.
---
Came here to say exactly this. FT away do an event it two and come back. Most of the time it piles.
---
Some also in Ash Heap and Savage Divide.
---
Well ive never had it be glitchy or seen it as "picky" so i guess im being creative wrong. Best of luck to your imagination!!
---
You got a build loadout for that? Sounds fun
---
Is that what is was for? I played for like the first month then quit. Just came back about a month ago and was wondering where I got that outfit cuz I know I did'nt buy it
---
Maxson was canonized after his death against his wishes, and his quest to preserve technology for the sole purpose of helping others was twisted into hoarding for the sake of hoarding.
---
Even in the original games, it's clear that the Brotherhood became much more isolationist and cult-ish over time.
---
Let's say this is an actual glitch and not just a visual one. Simply said, there is no system to flag this kind of stuff. They've proven that everything they can observe in this game is handled manually if they want to. They had to implement "something something" to track down the glitches with fast traveling and challenges auto completing. That means there are nearly no systems in place to trace this stuff.
---
Honestly you're prolly just better at it then me or figured some good shit out lol
---
The player count and surging popularity after it came out says otherwise. The diehard ESO players that use the forums probably do say otherwise but it still became more popular.
---
I just went ahead and replaced him with a normal deathclaw, thank you tho. If my new boy dies, I'll keep this in mind if I wrangle another scorched one.
---
Installed an artillery cannon on the roof of my place near Grafton Dam so I can wreck Mad Dog Malone and his gang.
---
I'd love different game modes. I hope one day they either allow it open to modder to make their own PvP rules or do something. I'd love a king of the hill it cap the flag thing. The game mode has so much potential. I love how slower pace and strategic it is compared to these other shooter games with tiny maps or fast pace action.
---
They havent added any new challenging content yet. Maybe when Collosses drops, and the daily ops become a thing, but until then, there is no new challenging content. Not yet.
---
And the thing is, legendary perks arent an empty grind. There are real, substantial goals and milestones in the grind. Increases to perks, useful perks, even allowing MORE perks. There is actual progress in the legendary perks.
---
Right now, there is literally nothing to do in the game that isnt already there. As it stands, this game is essntially unchanged since 9+ months ago, aside from SOME bug fixes, and by the look of it, multiple more bugs added.
---
It’s live tmrw (14th US Timezone not Aus/Asia)
---
Good call. Scorched ones are kinda ugly anyways.
---
I think if they were to make the whole legendary perk system account wide, it would be fine.
---
Meta comment
---
Wait til you see what they do when you bring up wanting to see more pvp options
---
That's the key to NW, its playing while not caring. Just have fun with it, no reason to make it unbearable.
---
I dont think 1000s of levels is the current grind goal. It seems like 800+ is more the current goal. The newInto the Vault said the doubled perk coin payouts.
---
Also, Having an extra 30 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points might be well worth a heafty grind to be honest.
---
Lol me too but that’s part of the reason I live it so much. I have all of the spawn points for the ghouls memorized and can loot it and clear it in about 10. Though I rarely do the robot area. Level 50 mr gutsys are the Bain of my existence I can easily one or two shot an assaultron, but those damn gutsy one shot me all the damn time.
---
you act as though your input on test server stuff actually effects its finalization and not just what they fix that's neccesary and broke that they didnt notice. How many things did people say no to that still made it in this damn game, or at the same time how many things did people scream yes for that then never appeared. the idea of a public test server for this games kinda hillarious because it seems like all the servers are actually a test with all the damn bugs discovered, AFTER stuff goes thru Public Test
---
If you're familiar with Magic the Gathering, a "Hangarback Walker" boss-type would be awesome. Essentially a massive support platform walker that launches swarms of the smaller guys out of itself.
---
If you want someone's attention (while they are at a vendor or a stash box or busy on their Pip Boy or crafting), don't melee them, don't shoot at them, don't throw grenades. Just throw an emote or wait.
---
So this is why that settler was freaking out so much 😂
---
Oh, so if it'll be available I can use Install option in the launcher?
---
A mission you are given by them is to literally steal food and resources from nearby farms and settlements. Under Maxson they have a zero tolerance policy for anything other than human. If you want Dense as a companion, he's going to get exiled from the Brotherhood because he is a Synth despite fighting for the Brotherhood even after said exile. 
---
They want to take down the Institute. Not because the Institute are abducting civilians but because they have technology the Brotherhood can not directly control. The solution to that by Maxson is to reactivate Liberty Prime and destroy the Institute. Maxsons Brotherhood are not interested in helping out the Commonwealth. 
---
Hell inform them about Acadia in Far Harbor and they will launch an assault and kill everyone inside. No dialogue, no negotiation. Afterwards they don't speak to the Harbormen and Women, nor do they look for the Church of Atom, they just turn up. Kill a bunch of people. And leave again. 
---
The Brotherhood in Fallout 4 are a fascist military junta.
---
Sure, player count is up, but the amount of people actually playing at any given time drops SIGNIFICANTLY a couple weeks after any given expansion; at least on Xbox anyway. That Player Count is padded to high hell with people who play for 2 weeks, realise that game sucks and then uninstall. 
---
Greymoor JUST came out a few weeks ago, of course the numbers are up at the minute lol. They'll help tanking again soon enough, just like before Greymoor released. The game is also infested with bots that pay for ESO+, so there's that too...
---
Casual Player Count doesn't compare to the die hard players that have played since day 1, that's the issue with these games companies. They cater to the casual "new" player base and leave the experienced endgame players behind.
---
Sock puppet account thats like 6 years old, and has thousands of karma posting on other subs, like r/FORTnITE r/Vermintide and r/HazbinHotel as well as making comments on r/AskReddit r/Funny and r/ForHonor
---
Totally a fake account here.
---
Probably because like me in usually at the limit of Casey weight and scrip.
---
I don't really want another load of scrap containers and repair kits taking up space.
---
The real issue is people accept this level of disrepair. Any other game would not have sold so well. It's completely coasting on the fallout brand. Please stop playing and buying buggy games so we as the customers can form a united front to force Bethesda to make a feature complete game. 
---
Do we miss out on some games? Yes
---
But it does work out of in the long run if we stick to our guns as consumers.
---
I'll say it this way. I think if fallout 76 was the sonic movie. We would still have the original sonic that paramount made and people would praise them for sticking with it. 
---
Your fallout 76 is actively ruining future Bethesda releases. Because this is the level of standards people expect now. Just like how microtransactions are rampant in games.
---
I do wanna say you're not the only ones at fault, but you only have yourselves to blame. Stop playing or at the least stop putting money into this specifically. Expect more quality before you buy anything.
---
They are super rare, especially in 3\* form.  I have two characters over 450 and one in the 300's and I've only gotten three good ones.  B2525, B2515 and B5015.  I traded for one of them, but two were drops.  One from mama murmgph and one from fashnacht.
---
I think you meant reduced VATS, not AP refresh.
---
And less rambleing
---
Since you didn't mention it, there is going to be no weapons balance pass here?  right now there is only 1 build that is viable for pve.  Viable is the wrong word, optimized.  You go bloody or hope you do enough damage to the SBQ to get rewards.
---
Well, did you place it?! The anticipation is killing me!
---
so what happens when I'm doing feed the people at level fifteen and a 300 shows up, will it now scale to his level and my LOW level event is ruined? (just an example but you should get what I mean)
---
Agreed, but boycotting the event does have quantitative impact that they definitely see.
---
They calculated those goals based on data collected about players. If those players don't participate, then the goals won't get met. That's exactly what happened with the Concrete goal.
---
The spin they put on it was "our bad for making it too high, let's lower it" hides the truth. If expected players participated, that goal would have been met relatively quickly. These goals, as well as the stretch goals, are always expected to be safely met, even with a huge margin of error. In this case, we made that margin much bigger.
---
And spend them at the last minute because you'll get more bang for the buck.  Higher levels take much more time to complete.
---
I was playing a match last night, down to the final 10 and I need to move so I start running up the hill to get to the dark shady spot lots of bushes right next to a rock wall basically and that Bush was an unarmed rookie in his blue Vault-tec suit...At this point I had marine armor and an automatic combat rifle and a combat shotgun and I wasn’t gonna mess with the dude, until he started punching me. Took him out, and then two more that ran right in front of my bush only to get killed by the winner. I got second
---
Mind you, when I play solo I bush wookie Until I can’t anymore. Once I get to that spot I have to look for weapons and armor, don’t really feel like a bush wookie in marine armor though
---
Literally just soloed encryptid, some low levels initiated it and bailed;  with just 3 minutes left and 4 nuka quantoms i finished  the event - 1 star mutant  scout chest piece, and a 3 star protectron that blew up inside terrain on death and wasnt lootable - why even bother with these events - wasting thousands of worth in aid and ammo for a 3 point scrip.
---
Every time I take more than 4 the server crashes.
---
ESO uses a scaling system similar to One Wasteland and it works great. However, the health and damage system in that is quite different from 76, so it'll be interesting to see how that works.
---
The CMs browse here to collect bug reports. That's a big part of their job. if you personally don't want to read them, them filter them out.
---
For me it seems to be VATs. I’m a heavy gun build and if I use vats I will do damage enough to bring the health bar down to just the barest sliver of health and the enemy won’t die. I’ll come out of VATs and see the health refill and I’ll have to hip fire or manually aim and then I can kill whatever.
---
Not really, pretty sure they've redone the vault raids and there will be other stuff as well
---
Yes but it's still Better to leave Them to Institute and the best final is where You save all the factions
---
yes, hopefully in the next few hours you will be able to download it

I RP my BoS character as the BoS from fallout 3. They worked with and defended the wastelanders from the Enclave who wanted to poison the Capital Wastland's water with a GECK.
---
The BoS in F76 aren't just black and white either. " Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible. " The BoS are a dynamic faction in fallout, and morally grey decisions has been one of the best parts of fallout for me.
---
If you have a fence or stairs snapped to the floor, you can't remove the floor, as those require a floor they can snap onto to be placed.
---
Also, if you have another floor snapped to your floor that would not have been able to be placed on its own because it's clipped into the ground or floating, you can't remove the initial floor until the snapped floor is removed.
---
It can be frustrating, I know, but you have to work backwards according to snapping rules.
---
I get that 800 is a big number but that's to max out all 6 slots.  you can max out 1 slot by around 200 or so, which I think is something that a lot of players can achieve.  2nd slot around 325 also is not an unrealistic figure.
---
Or alternatively you could get all 6 slots to rank 2 by around 240 or so.  maxing out ALL the slots is something that shouldn't necessarily be a hand out.
---
The main thing the new system does is screw people with multiple characters.  1 level \~800 and change to max out all the slots is something you could shoot for with the new lunchbox xp bonuses and the public team xp bonuses.  but 800+ on 5 slots per account? that's a tall order.
---
What player list?
---
I meant the whole adding time as artificial difficulty and 3 levels of difficulty.
---
I just hope the pts feedback turns it into not such a shit show as the vault raids were.
---
Oh right there's cork also
---
I'm just picturing a level 500 in my head doing a bobble run across forest and spawning in all kinda super high levels, then since they loaded in the cell first little guy fresh out the vault comes along, the cell hasnt despawned yet, and proceeds to get S&amp;M dominated by some of the scariest shit this game has to offer.
---
MAN I'M SO FUCKING MAD THAT LEVELING UP INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF AMS HEADQUARTERS IN WATOGA DIDN'T COUNT FOR LEVELING UP IN WATOGA. BECAUSE AMS HQ HAS THE SAME PARENT LOCATION AS WATOGA, AS IF AMS WAS OUTSIDE OF BUT ADJACENT TO WATOGA
---
CBZ13!!!!!!!!!!
---
I’ve tried but nothing seems to work I’ve seen other people complaining about it I think it’s a glitch that came with the update
---
but I started less then a week ago...
---
Some NPCs in 76 smoke. I've seen a few raiders smoking for their idle animations.
---
It's just out of the water not he shore, you just go to where the deathclaw came out of the ground, the signal gets stronger the closer you get
---
I had that for a while on PS4 when I would fast travel to my camp. I searched all over for that bloody bass player. Haven’t heard it for a while. I guess he’s moved on to you. Now Sophia randomly follows people to scorched earth. Tripped me out the 1st time I heard her yelling at the SBQ and then slipping right back into her lines about how she loves her new life etc.
---
Edit spelling
---
what are loadouts. I'm new to the game.
---
Clueless people who want them as a trophy will probably buy them.
---
You wanna talk PVP? Here's getting baited into a ban for 6 pages by guys with 10k posts on the forums
---
Thx!
---
Because there is no system to flag things.
---
Anything they catch, they have to check manually.
---
That's how so many cheaters slip under the radar. If they don't notice anything at the time they look, they won't do anything.
---
I like my chicken coop. However, I think it was definitely a missed opportunity for something more functional and desirable. Maybe a frog tank that produces eggs for those delicious donuts? Still not space themed, but definitely more unique than a secondary fertilizer producer.
---
Haha yes.
---
*A wild bear appears*
---
Sneak attack x 2.0
---
Sneak attack x 2.0 (shit sweet)
---
Oh fuck.
---
Give me a god damn rock!
---
I’ve had it and I’ve never played NW.
---
The BoS in fallout are a dynamic faction. People have different view points on them. They have been good and bad depending on your point of view. This is one reason they are my favourite faction.
---
its a visual glitch
---
No idea then, but just some audio bug.
---
Too bad it wasn't a rabbit. But tbh that would be too OP.
---
wait are you talking about the thing that flys around with 3 vertibirds or what ever their called .
---
You're forgetting two loading screens to get into the lobby, a 2 minute countdown, another loading screen, another countdown, and another loading screen just to get into the match.
---
It is sad that the game is balanced around 1 effect with everything else being lower 'scrip' tiers.
---
What *is* toxic is when the community rallies around shaming the *evil bloody build*.
---
That needs to be redirected into "why is there only one viable end game effect?"
---
Calm down Dexter
---
Well, there are examples where the devs do listen and there are examples where they don't. If we weren't vocal on what's wrong with legendary perk system, we'd already end up with buggy, useless and tremendously grindy legendary perk system two patches ago. It would be quite disappointing to say the least. After all the feedback we posted here and there on the pts forums they decided to postpone this system's release and after that (surprise, surprise!) even some positive changes had been made to it.
---
This is just one example, but it does show that they might react to the input we make. It's pretty safe to assume that without it they wouldn't have a slightest clue about what's wrong with this system. And it'd end up in yet another shitstorm of community backlash. And I presume that's not exactly what they need atm, so it's good to listen to their playerbase every once in a while for a change.
---
I was just talking about the actual match but yea all this is just more in the “bad mode” category
---
Because the Mr Handys keep finding bodies of civil war soldiers there and won’t let anyone settle there until the get everyone buried.
---
Another poster suggested lake Eloise, but I don't recommend it because they've added many floaters there and you'll get attacked.  Often.  I had my base there but ended up moving it out of frustration with constantly getting my base wrecked even with max rocket turrets.
---
But.
---
If you go a bit further south, just at the southern boundary of the map near the bear, there is another unnamed lake that has nice flat areas on each end and not too many things to get in the way of building.  There are some trees but they can be removed.  IMO a really nice place to build and you won't get attacked much at all.
---
The lake is just west of Johnson's acre.
---
I loved them since I saw them in F3. They are not just disney like good or evil. They are more complex, morally grey. 
---
In F3  they worked with and defended the wastelanders from the Enclave who wanted to poison the Capital Wastland's water with a GECK. 
---
In F4:  They were more like the Enclave, killing almost anything different. 
---
In F76:  They demanded supplies. Also " Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible. "
---
I'm excited since my pc at the time couldn't handle the raid at all. But I have a feeling this is more randomized and not necessarily limited to vaults but also other interiors. I have nothing to base this on other than my interpretation of the article.
---
Ghillie skin for my workbenches :) or better yet, workbench skin that fits into the red-orange theme of the Bog.
---
Honestly thank god for dupers otherwise queen fights would drag on and we'd always fail project paradise because bad lucker is defending with a ghoul slayer crossbow.
---
The bad RNG and bad power creep are what gives that staggering incentive to duping.
---
Should it happen? No. But the game shouldn't be relying on everyone running a 0.05% drop.
---
I'm not for this, especially the jetpack.
---
Firstly it'd look weird either having the jet animation appear out of nowhere or have none and you float around magically.
---
Also if you're going to make jetpacks invisible, what reason would there be to not go all the way and make power armour or weapons or certain camp items like water purifiers invisible. There wouldn't be any.
---
Mine always shows up again after an hour. Not sure what I’m doing to see it again though.
---
Just like Lyons in F3.
---
No doubt that Bethesda's solution to this would be to prevent you getting more vault steel when you server hop.
---
Yea, that’d be nice. We got a CAMP skin that doesn’t work so it’s be nice to get workshop skins that do
---
Once i eventually get the ghouls to spawn they then respawn whenever you leave then rejoin the server. On a good run i can get 4 or 5 circuits of whitespring before the nuke zone goes away
---
I'm sorry but the system won't handle it.. Or by that I mean some systems can't handle it. If they abided by this suggestion they would have to raise the minimum requirements for playing the game. And that wouldn't be fair to the OG ps4, Xbox and gtx 1050 users since they already bought the game thinking they would be able to play it. Imagine the lag we have from tesla at the moment but in people's camps instead.
---
Ore runner here too, I’m having trouble finding enough people to do the event and keep those NPCs alive.
---
Go there and say *"there will never be a Fallout New Vegas 2"* to collect downvotes and salt
---
Ps4
---
For the first time in 400+ hours of playing I had extreme lag last night while trying to build a new camp.
---
I was alone on a private server.
---
Every time I'd try to move the camera it would just lock up and then take a few seconds to start sluggishly moving. Sometimes locking up for a full 2 minutes. 
---
I server hopped, turned pip boy radio off thinking that might be causing it, but nothing kept it from happening every 10 minutes or so.
---
Was the first time I've had to set the controller down and say out loud "This is unplayable".
---
I'm one of those weirdos that isn't bothered by 99.9% of the bugs, including blue screen, as I've RP'd in my head that it's just my character experiencing radiation sickness and blacking out etc. 
---
But that's mainly because I can get right back into the action within 40 seconds. 
---
Really hope this lag issue doesn't stick around.
---
If i leave a private world and then join in again, thats the same world? Didn't know that. And how you get the bloated to spawn. Only normal dead ghouls everywhere when i solo nuked
---
Yes that is so annoying
---
Casuals are moreso the players posting their C- camps, writing fake stories "dear X,", and patting themselves on the back for wasting 1000 rounds on a L50 Scorchbeast .
---
It's still on the development floor. They haven't said whether it will or won't happen yet.
---
Are you referring to this:  " Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible. " ?
---
I think the AFKers were the reason (at least one of the reasons) why people started nuking Fasnacht.
---
It's a bit annoying to get them to spawn the first time.
---
I usually clear out all of whitespring, launch the nuke, fast travel away from the area, wait for it to hit then leave the server. You may need to do this one or two more times but eventually they will all spawn and you're good to go. You get a few minutes after leaving a private server to be able to rejoin the same one. Hope this helps
---
Thank you!
---
My Two Shot Gauss Shotgun gets me ~7 crits at a time if it works properly in VATS.
---
Mmm no I don’t think it counts as double crit, but you can crit while free aiming so maybe you missed some? also, why do you refuse to do it? It’s one of the easiest challenges I think
---
I’ve noticed lately that sometimes the SBQ will not have any loot when I check, but wait a minute or so and check again it’s there. There seems to be some lag in the loot showing up.
---
It absolutely does, I’ve done it many times, and there’s plenty of old videos about it from before the legendary spawn nerf since it was an incredible farm spot. I don’t know if it’s the only interior that can be nuked, I just know that it can be lol
---
Or maybe give everyone a chance to try?
---
Where do I get those plans from?
---
Shotguns are broken outside of VATS. VATS is buggy too.
---
Gunplay is just awful.
---
On the social menu you can filter over to "recent players" and that shows everyone that is/was on the server with you.
---
I didn't mean being in the vault, but the mechanics.The issues this game has and it being timed is not a good combo. 
---
 But you're right I should hold my judgment until more info is released probably by pts players tomorrow.
---
I would've thought the last line made it obvious I was joking.
---
I just don’t do it because I don’t use VATS for the guaranteed Crit so it’s hit or miss usually when it’s the challenge of the week
---
Dont you get it? You will get enclave stuff... next year.... what do you think the DLC after Brotherhood will be?
---
Upvoted for spelling fashnacht similarly to fa*shart*
---
Since the Bandolier perk exists, I can and will stack ammo infinitely.
---
This glitch actually strengthens the economy because I can buy more ammo.
---
That's what, 200 years from now? The BoS is not just a static faction nor are they the same in the locations they operate. They are morally grey, and morally grey decisions has been one of the best parts of fallout for me.
---
I'm now level 80,thanks man.
---
Disconnected: Unknown Error
---
ok. I will try again. Nuking harpers ferry last time did not affect the burrows.
---
I myself love the BoS, mostly because of their military style and i think it would be fun help a faction build up a base from the ground up instead of just coming back to the game and having both factions already built and ready to start their missions
---
Be handmades are just too much fun
---
This isn't possible without completely gutting the system.
---
Maybe try centering it on the entrance? It’s been awhile since I was the one to launch it, but I went into a nuked burrows about 2 months ago and I haven’t seen any patch notes about it since so
---
Yes. It seems most here know the BoS from F4 and what they want to remember from F76. They like to forget " Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible. ".
---
" BoS is actually a very nuanced faction " this is what makes them my favourite faction in fallout.
---
Don’t be afraid to switch perk cards out to improve your build or for crafting and repair in camp. Always use green thumb when harvesting plants, ammosmith and super duper when crafting ammo, super duper when cooking. And most importantly don’t forget to switch your perk cards back when leaving camp. Also get mutations that work with your play style and build. I was over 1000 hours in before I did and don’t know why I waited so long now. And pick up plastic, springs, screws and gears.
---
the whole game could be way more interesting than it is now
---
They do seem a bit sparse
---
They play their game. It’s mandatory for them to play their game for a set time  every day for testing purposes.
---
It’s not like this information is hard to find. You guys complain way too much when this game offers enough content to be enjoyable for a one time purchase.
---
So I am now level 230 and I may have one legendary perk fully upgraded, that is wait for it.... Legen... Daryyyy
---
vs carnivore with 8 int and 25 exp food what does herbivore have we don't?
---
This is just a personal rule for me but if a player dies near you don't take their junk bag. If you have the Halloween witch dress put it on and stand on their bag so it can't be grabbed until they get back.
---
Other may disagree but as someone who doesn't have fallout 1st it sucks to lose a bag.
---
In PvP though it's totally fair.
---
I use a bow and flame arrows to tag
---
They dont create ash piles like teslas
---
If I'm trying to get my 3 nukes in, I want her dead as quick as possible.
---
I cheat the silos hard and it is still a huge time sink. I get very frustrated when the BOS hard hats keep her up in the air with One Gun Army for 25 minutes.
---
&gt;They were working with the Responders about the Scorched
---
Only the plague and dealing with the humanoid scorched, they hid the existence of the Scorchbeasts - even going so far as to call them 'Sierra Bravos' over the radio so The Responders and Free States wouldn't know.
---
&gt;until their relationship broke down over disagreements over resources.
---
Yes, the whole taking food from farmers at gunpoint part.
---
I find they're like waiting for busses. You wait ages for one then 3 come along at once
---
I'm at 80-82 with two accounts that I play about an hour each a night.
---
Hey I love spamming that when the event hits the 20 minute mark. It's great for forcing people off the bunker.
---
Definitely super easy. Even with low AP non vats builds
---
SBQ + Automatic gun = Easy crits
---
There aren’t dense bushes in the open field of the bog. The strategy would be between hiding/fighting in the trenches and building protective structures to not get sniped. There also aren’t hills/mountains everywhere, it’s more of a valley making everywhere a kill zone outside of the small, dilapidated and scattered cabins/forward bases.  Dropping in Watago for protection would be a bad idea unless the player is a “pro” because everyone else will be thinking the same thing and dropping next to them. I think the bog could be a more unique feeling map in comparison to FW/MT.
---
Deciding to hold up and murder farmers for food isn't 'misguided' or 'flawed' it's downright evil.
---
Even Meg is better than that...
---
Higher difficulty events are easier to complete when youre in a server with more endgame players, i highly doubt that the level 12 running in a blank power armor frame with a pipe pistol will be able to do much besides tickle the scorchbeast queen. Im not discouraging new players from joining events, but having more experienced players means theres a higher chance of success
---
I really enjoy the shotgun though I'm sure you can get more DPS with Minigun but shotgun is so fun, love it.
---
&gt; Almost winning NW
---
I have my doubts about this specific statement, so let's analyze...
---
&gt; then died to a full group
---
Yup. This is why I personally believe you potentially weren't anywhere near winning it.
---
Look, I've won a few Nuclear Winters either by joining solo, or having my team die halfway through and doing the last part solo. It *is* definitely doable. However, I believe the best matchup I've personally been able to get a win against has been 1v2.
---
If you're in a 1v3 situation in the end, it's exponentially more difficult than 1v2, and I dare say, if you end up in a 1v4, you'd have to be Shroud to take them all out before the ones that are still up pick up their downed buddies. The team of 4 people will quite often have at least 2-3 people in marine armor and with purple weapons. Sometimes they've got those sweet orange ones. To take out the entire team they'd have to be really, really bad compared to you, or you'd just have to get super lucky with a bunched up group and a well placed grenade, or something like that.
---
That's not to say nobody has *ever* won in a 1v4 situation. I'm sure some people have. But my point is, getting to #5 is quite easy, but the hill you have to climb from #5 to #1 if it's a 1v4 at the end is almost vertical.
---
And all of that is assuming you have no hackers/cheaters in the game, because it'll be the hackers/cheaters you'll be facing in the very end.
---
This is why I personally wish they'd finally get around to implementing a proper solo mode into Nuclear Winter, where *everyone* joins solo, and where there are no groups whatsoever. As an option to the existing one. I mean, I think it's safe to say none of the developers play battle royales actively, because if they did, I'm convinced they'd implement this. Wanting to play solo, and having to join solo into a mode where there are groups of 4 people is just downright asinine.
---
do not fast travel
---
As a high level, I agree with most of the advice you gave.  XP is important, moreso than most people know at the beginning.
---
I'll add, low level weapons and armor are dogshit.  Until you hit level 50 or so, you will struggle to do decent damage and survive.  To counter this, when I level up a character, I like to use the damage multipliers from crouching/headshots to get more damage.  I don't mean sneak around the map hiding in every bush, but when you get within 30 yards or so of an enemy, just crouch down and aim for the head.  You'll get somewhere around 4x damage if you stay out of "Danger" status and hit headshots.  VATS is your friend, so get rank 1 of Concentrated fire ASAP so that VATS can target headshots.
---
You have to do 1000 damage to the queen to get loot from her, so don't run down to scorched earth with your trusty hunting rifle.  You'll fail.  Instead, grab any fast firing auto weapon and a bunch of ammo.  Use sneak and target her head. Even if you are only hitting for 2 damage per shot, 500 rounds will get you loot.  .38 or 10mm is cheap and often free.   A crafted pipe auto is enough.  Don't even bother shooting at her unless she lands.  At low levels though, realistically you shouldn't worry much about getting loot off the queen.. as you noted the XP is the big win there.
---
Not against CHSS, PAs, people hopping aruound... It's actually very situational.
---
Yes a ts weapon will count as two crits for the challenge. Your best bet is to do it with a shotgun though, you'll get like 7 crits per hit since it counts each pellet
---
Can you provide a picture? I'm not sure what you're referring to but I'm definitely curious
---
Brotherhood of Steal
---
I did my first NW today (not counting yesterday's as I dropped in spawned 3 camps and left) and I managed to stealth my way to 6th place. I fought no one. I hid in bushes, creeping up every time the storm got close. Then someone ran past my hiding spot and accidentally sicced a Grafton Monster on me, which knocked me off a cliff, but I landed on a small outcropping halfway down, where it couldn't get me. I glitched my head into the wall to hide my hair and had my scout armor on to help camouflage in. I watched several fire fights go on just beneath my feet while I waited for that last few minutes to tick by. The only way down from the cliff was death by radstorm or death by gravity. Gravity was faster. 
---
Not a wholly unpleasant experience, but it is not a mode I plan on playing truly. I did it for the score...
---
I'm assuming they will Co exist. I can not seem them getting rid of content like that
---
Happy cakeday!
---
This is an intentional feature. This mechanic can be replicated by standing on the same spawn marker. It is to prevent the player from getting ganked by newly spawned enemies. It extends to the tent to prevent them from spawning and getting stuck on top of the tent.
---
At this point stories like these are why Bethesda can’t even fix this issue with a ban. Tons of innocent players have been attacked by others who want to ruin people’s experiences. 
---
Unfortunately from what I’ve read, you can’t get rid of it and your budget is lost, however you won’t get banned because of the situation at hand
---
When/where did you find it????
---
Have a wonderful cake day!
---
Not to mention it was a glorified fetch quest to the end. Playing hide and seek with key cards.
---
Why share this? Now, when you need to kill 3 legendaries even more people come in to steal your kill
---
Sadly that's useless when you serverhop.
---
Well we will find out tonight as I am sure a lot will be streaming it.
---
Same here, I prefer much more straightforward and better lit locations like WT, Huntersville, NIRA, Steakhouse and Whitespring.
---
At this point i still don't understand these posts, or the people giving these posts money
---
It's possible. There are times when I can force something to place when it doesn't want to. It may be that you accidentally placed your floors in a place it normally wouldn't allow, and now none of them can be removed because they're all "illegal".
---
They created that problem to sell you the scrapbox.
---
Shame there isnt a legendary fried chicken recipe to go with that
---
They definitely will, no reason to drop a major story line
---
Stop being such a Hypocrite...this is just sad
---
&gt;Only the plague and dealing with the humanoid scorched, they hid the  existence of the Scorchbeasts - even going so far as to call them  'Sierra Bravos' over the radio so The Responders and Free States  wouldn't know. 
---
They always called them Sierra Bravos, even in written notes around Defiance that would only be read by other Brotherhood members.  Perhaps they initially used the NATO alphabet for confidentiality, but they plainly used it after they were no longer a secret, so I'm unconvinced.
---
&gt; Yes, the whole taking food from farmers at gunpoint part. 
---
Are you referring to a specific instance?
---
The reality is that the Brotherhood of Steel was more involved with directly fighting the Scorched than anyone else, and plainly they needed resources to do that. The simple truth is that when it came to things like medical supplies or ammunition, their need was demonstrably greater than the Responders or even the Free States.
---
Does that make coercing resources from others moral? No; but perhaps the other survivors should have recognized the Brotherhood's apparent need without needing to be coerced.
---
Mmm not really,they look more like dungeons where you blast through some enemies and then fight a boss.
---
From the itv it's not clear if the boss will have raid mechanics,like the imposter sheepsquatch for example, or just special traits like invisibility(said in itv,it would mean no vats like assaultrons).
---
I don't think think the dungeon before the boss will have any raid mechanic,otherwise they would have called them raids. The timer will be there for min maxed builds that can smash through in less time......oh right everyone is bloodied so that will be a breeze.
---
Also some new legendary perks give good damage boosts and protection,like stealth damage and rad protection.
---
Overall I don't really care if they're easy or not. The raid on hard was easy to do for my crew ,yet we still did them everyday and we're still reaping the benefits to this day.  If it's a new group activity I can play with them again, i'm all in  and excited about it.
---
I feel your pain man.  Its always something shitty like Distinguished Guests or Dogwood Die Off.  Then pop events like Radiation Rumble or Project Paradise that few want to bother trying to solo and people rarely show up.
---
I'd love to see them raise the rate of events even a little bit.  25% would be awesome.
---
Theyve been out of whack now for a while. I dont know if participation plays any part in how often they roll up. Seems to me if not many players turn up to them or a few happen without any players showing up they seem to stop but I havent studied it.
---
Game cant handle you having so many weapons. Try going to Line in the Sand or any event and picking up every weapon. After like the 60th one youll have fps problems moving around and browsing you inventory.
---
It's a waste of a nuke  you get more XP from killing Super Mutants in west tek without 20 minutes of nuke setup time. 
---
You can still clear and then log off server then log back in and it will be full again. 
---
It more important to have a very high intelligence than anything else and if you are doing it for legendarys then you are better off at West Tek as well as you can get up to 5 spawn in a run.. you can also get zero in a run but that is not often. 
---
With 60 intelligence I was getting : glowing ghoul = 245 xp Whitesprings
---
Super mutant  west tek = around 400 and above for xp. 
---
Better off doing the Queen just for the repair kits than Nuking Whitesprings.
---
I totally agree, there’s obviously some bugs and problems but overall it’s a really fun game. People just love to complain
---
Yeah I agree with this. I often use 1-2 chems and 3 or so drink/food buffs all on different timers. Not to mention if I ever wanna use a bobblehead or magazine.
---
If the camp is moved, the machine is stored, but it will not be visible in the stored items tab. If you build another one, it will take up more budget, not counting as a stored item that you're building again. Currently, there's no way to clear the missing budget.
---
It does indeed work like that; also makes group pvp basically impossible.
---
Yeah man that’s what I was thinking, love the classic shotgun/zombie runs.. in all honestly though I’m more scared of Charred ghouls than the nuked ones.
---
Mainly I want to farm glowing mass and high rad fluids. Want to collect and maybe sell
---
I don't have a solution, but thought that i'd offer my information. I personally did this quest *after* the recent patch, so it isn't necessarily every time nor is it directly caused by the patch. Have you tried just going to the location to see if you can progress regardless?
---
But.. from memory, i kinda skipped a few of the optional objectives in this chain, seeing as this was an alt and this "content" is lacklustre (at best..)
---
But Thank you for the explanation
---
Yes! I saw one next to the bridge by the overseers camp. Level 1 legendary chicken.
---
I finally scrapped him! He was driving me crazy!! "Nothing new on the radio tonight..." ugh! I wanna do missions dude... give me a story line and something to do dangit!! I'd already completed Beckett... so I started the lady so I at the least had a story to follow... and if I had to listen to the Raider punk ramble on one more I was going to throat punch him....
---
Yeah, but I presume with OP's idea they could still show the player's level but only if they are actively in the world with you.
---
Raider Punk drove me insane....
---
Visit Mama Murphy and toll the dice. That’s how you re-roll them.
---
I started f76 when wastelanders comes out and i'm almost 480lvl. Honestly i dont understand why a lot of old players are low levels.
---
All of these posts, be it the defenders or those who think it's shit, seem to forget or conveniently ignore that the XP curve is not flat, it's linear growth.
---
So, for the first version, the one with 1 perk point per card, you'd need to reach around level 1500.
---
Level 1500 is 179,939,960 XP. \~180 Million XP.
---
Doubling the perk points per card drops the level to 750.
---
Level 750 is 44,969,960 XP. \~45 Million XP.
---
Level 1500 is completely absurd. Even with all the buffs we're getting 180 Million XP is literally a dream for pretty much 99% of the playerbase. Guess Beth agreed and changed it partially because of the insanity behind the XP requirements.
---
Level 750 is achievable but still requires a good amount of grind and I'm willing to bet that a vast majority of the playerbase will not bother with that either because they've quit long before getting close because of the other issues all the game mechanics in this game has, caps and limits on everything, but that's a topic that usually leads to people yelling at those who agree that they're playing the game wrong and should get gud, so let's not go there.
---
Question is, why do we need yet another fucking "currency"? Let us hide cards we don't want to see or use and never speak of them again.
---
For the Legendary Perks, just make them level up with the player. 1 Million flat for each level of a perk card, that's 30 Million XP to get them to max. 30 Million XP is roughly level 614. It's lower then any of the two above mentioned systems but it's still high enough to ensure that only a small percentage will get there "fast" if they chose to grind. 
---
Of course, for existing players already achieved XP would have to be applied retroactively but that's not exactly an unsolvable problem.
---
TL;DR
---
Old system = Ass
---
New system on PTS = Nice but still ass.
---
Hmm more angry fans sounds nice.
---
I'll finish it this coming monday,but I think i'll buy the last level to have it done on sunday and start the week without the thought of challenges.or not I don't,deoends how I'll fell on sunday.
---
&gt;The simple truth is that when it came to things like medical supplies or ammunition, their need was demonstrably greater than the Responders or even the Free States.
---
&gt;Does that make coercing resources from others moral? No; but perhaps the other survivors should have recognized the Brotherhood's apparent need without needing to be coerced.
---
Raider mentality, through and through.
---
I used to have a camp in the cliffs above the monorail elevator. It had a great view of the Cranberry Bog. You could watch the nukes drop and see all the green flashes from there.
---
Much easier craft.
---
With a shotgun you complete that challenge with 4 or 5 enemies
---
I'm sorry you  missed out on looting your 1* legendary meat hook.
---
Please show me :)
---
Nothing. But INT on hervivore is easier to craft because scorchy brians are more rng, fungus aren't.
---
Carnivore has more melee bonuses,herbivore has more crit and vats bonuses.
---
How the fuck are you 480 in 4 months?
---
"Blueprint cannot be placed. Needs support. Object is floating."
---
It will never ever happen, because it would require *fixing* the build system rather than just nerfing it and adding Atom Store "content".
---
That being said.. how are blueprints actually stored? Could they theoretically be shared by exchanging files on PC? I play on PS4 so I have no idea.
---
It doesn't work. You have to each tag each other individually, though after you die, you would need to do it again...
---
Basically group pvp is dead. Le sigh.
---
Bahahahahahhahaaa..... sob... I love my Gauss Shotgun but you absolutely nailed the experience.
---
Im at the Captain cosmos jetpack so lvl 96 I think without buying anything
---
I want to dress it up like a BoS PoS. It was my first thought when I unlocked it, and I checked straight away 😬
---
That's not a dumb question, it's actually a hilarious story twist.
---
The BOS arrives, burns down the Crater and Foundation because they disagree over supplies.
---
Vault 79 gets raided, the secret service force recruited and all the plans get burned because the plebs of Appalachia do not deserve technological advanced weaponry.
---
All players currently not done buying everything will have to live with half finished armor and unmoddable Gauss weapons and move straight on to the BOS grind. New players are shit out of luck and get fuck all because they dared not playing during the Wastelander season.
---
Hmmmm.
---
And on the other side you just need to go a bit away from my camp and it's gone
---
What an idea. Simple too if they treat the corpse like customizing your ally
---
I only ever have 1 mutation, marsupial.
---
I am going to jump ontop of EVERYTHING
---
I find myself constantly laughing over this comment today. I need this shirt in my life 😂
---
Gauss mini is so overpowered I love it, I usually only use it for super tanky targets like sbq and the imposter when I’m trying to kill them a little quicker. What the others mentioned is spot on tho, the ammo gets pretty tedious to craft so I don’t use the mini as much as I would like
---
I think if they made the perk system account wide, it might help for those who have multiple characters to play.
---
And I don't mind having some way to remove perks and utilize them at the same time. Just hiding them doesn't help the game still has to register all the different types and levels of perks you have access to, hidden or not. Removing them helps the servers and game loading, hopefully.
---
Mind you, if they offer more ways to get perk coins other than scrapping perks, that will significantly reduce the time it takes to get max, so remember, they might add perk coins to the season rewards, some sort of daily quest, or additional coins at certain milestones.
---
We know they are continuing to add more to the system with each pts, but I still think the 'endless grind' is a mechanic desperately needed in this game. Without it, there is literally no reason to keep playing.
---
the next place is the tall garrahan mining hq building, and apparently there would be a message on a terminal there if it had updated correctly, so looks like i'm stuck for now.
---
  Is pressing spacebar harder when you're an herbivore?  P
---
Nerf bloodied?... naw just buff dieing...
---
Wtf is ITV ?    It"s tv channel in the UK to my own knowledge.
---
Love it!
---
The lore of BoS Is well explain long the BoS quest while the lore about supermutants Is explain in some enclave terminal at whitespring and at West Tech
---
Hiding jetpack would look really dumb.
---
I tried to go from monthly to annual using PayPal. Monthly expired annual did not kick in. After going back and forth with Bethesda, I contacted the company they use (can't remember their name) and threatened to get a refund. That seemed to do the trick.
---
i get it, but pls don’t do that ever again
---
That sucks.  
---
Looks like you might just have to bite the bullet and buy they plan for The Fixer then. I've seen people say that the Imposter Sheepsquatch Outfit only drops after you finish The Lowe Down, but I can confirm that is not true. Other than that... you're not really missing out on much tbh, even though i'm sure it is still frustrating as hell
---
I just can't believe how people can do the same mistake so many times.
---
It is just statistically improbable that you are hit with this bug mamy times, without doing something to trigger it.
---
Neither me or any of my friends were hit and we all completed it.
---
Are you sure you know what a raider is?
---
They don't loot and pillage because "they need it more"; they certainly aren't fighting an existential threat so that others don't have to. You're completely and deliberately ignoring the obvious, demonstrable service the Brotherhood of Steel provided - a service which clearly benefited every human in Appalachia. Once the Brotherhood was wiped out, the other factions failed quickly and utterly.
---
Being banged at a corner?
---
why does everyone hate the bos? i hate that bitch at the the start who makes u run a million errands the second she first meets u (and yes ik that’s every fallout npc but her quests fucking suck)
---
I did, and u must have gotten bored halfway thru mine, balanced is just a fancy word for nurf, wether u mean a card or a build
---
You obviously  don't have the musical companion at your camp...
---
Pretty sure they said in the quakcon video rhat endgame boss fights  like the SBQ,encryptid  and colossus are going to always spawn max level since they are meant to be difficult and endgame fights.
---
The enclave are the reason we have scorched.  
---
Can you talk more on that if you were being serious?
---
If it wasn’t for stable flux wouldn’t even do scorched earth
---
The fact is the chance of that event popping up in my private server is minimal,and if it happens in a public you basically need to be a dick and one shot the legendary,and be faster than the 3 others dicks who want to do the same thing as you.
---
Have you thought about perk card packs being given to us quite normally in seasons so far. I just passed a level where it gave me two packs.
---
But if you really did read my comment, why did you throw the "hurr hurr u prolly mad that some1 1shots an enemy" at me? Nerfs(and buffs) are vital to keep an online games meta fluent and diverse. Buffing everything and not nerfing anything is NOT vital solution to keep the game running for a long time. I hope that One Wasteland addresses this and makes the meta more fluent.
---
Do you think it will kill power levelling? How can you bring your low level friend to a super mutant nest for exp if he sees them as lvl 15 green babies?
---
Inside the Vault
---
I won't get into why *specifically* why, but suffice it to say that I enjoy hating and opposing them because of how well they are written. It is not at all that I wish they weren't in the game or anything like that! In Fallout 3, NV, 4, and even 76 they are written in a way that whether you love them or hate them there is plenty of history and information to back up your point of view. It's great!
---
I only ever get it when I pick plants and stuff. I used to think it was weird, but now I kinda dig it.
---
He prob plays like me and only have one character with high intelligence boosts. One level is a breeze in a hour, sometimes three levels in less thrn two hours for me and I passed 420 recently.
---
because we have been crying the game and enemies are too easy.
---
seriously. Give us what we been crying for and then people complain it not wanted. If i was a dev I would just tell people to \*\*\*\* off already.
---
It's a shame these suggestions are met by this comment.  You're not wrong though.
---
There used to be a glitch where you repaired a drill or a chainsaw to 200% and it did insane amounts of damage, did you by chance check the date on the video? If its an old video it could be a byproduct of this glitch
---
Nothing on Steel Dawn or Fractured Steel?
---
I agree. In addition, I was hoping for chickens to roam around my camp, much like the Brahim do with the feeder thing - I was a bit disappointed too
---
What happened to slot 7? You only have 6 Legendary Perk Slots.
---
Btw, we get a free brootherhood one at the end of the month...
---
I'm lucky. I always do the come here motion when legendary enemies turn up and lately I've had people doing it back.
---
I think it's annoying when you do an event and put work in, but then someone one shots a legendary.
---
Wow it popular anymore and get ain't an mmo
---
&gt;  If you nuke burrows as well it's all glowing ghouls which is a blast
---
Yeah, it's fun. But those ghouls don't have the stabilizing agents for flux. And they give the same XP as non-glowing ones.
---
This issue started a few weeks ago, my guess is that when they enabled the meat week events on pts they copy pasted some code to the main servers and messed up the events spawn. Meat week events take the place of the regular events we used to get but are disabled from the main servers. There are way less events going on the last couple weeks hopefully at some point one of the Bethesda devs will play the game and see it happening or the community managers will 'look into it' if your post happens to reach them, I don't expect a fix on that until patch 22-23.
---
I've been asking this since one wasteland was announced. Never a single response from Bethesda. Hopefully the PTS will see how it works.
---
That's why I was asking, especially when considering that the "social" tab is more than broken.
---
This would make the Brotherhood Engineer outfit wearable with a backpack! Currently it is clipping nightmare in my opinion.
---
If you use Armorer Rank 3 it is 10 Vault Steel per item. Still should up to limit to 50 or so.
---
If they would set it to 50 it would be the same as the modules. So please do.
---
In the uk?
---
Or let us link to spotify/imusic
---
And who needs more fertilizer anyway?  They totally missed the mark on this one.
---
Did you look at the answers on internet?
---
STRONK
---
i realise this isnt giving you 100 stimpaks but you reliably get stimpaks/radaway from defending workshops. capture 3 or 4 on an inactive server, and do the events every time they pop up, which with 4 or more should be frequently. i do this every so often and have never struggled for healing items
---
I Disagree on most of the things you say. The responders, Free States and all the Comic-Heros bullshit would just be boring for me and i hope they never, ever do this. (There are nothing then wanna-be-good-guys that do more harm then good.) But you are right that they should add more Factions into the Game. And you can actually join them. And not stay forever the middle Man or the one who joined every faction.  
---
I hope i can join the BoS, because thats the Faction i like and the only Faction that does something right for me.  
---
Thats why i hated to work with Modus or doe all this Responder bullshit in the Vanilly Game. Or why i hate that i still get Enclave missions.  
---
The same for the Raiders and Settlers. You choose a side and in the end it dosent matter because you can still get all the rewards etc from the other side and nothing really matters.  
---
Not to mention that after the Game came out they talked about Faction PvP. I wondering what happend to it.
---
Yes, well, we can hope and dream, can’t we? :)
---
If they hit you with their shoopdawhoop, don't run but jump. They have more problems keeping their aim that way.
---
No he means no teams during gameplay.
---
This. Until you have full of whatever it is you are going for use this. I still use it at 210 as a junkie, just a wonderful piece of kit.
---
I mean I try to do them but I have no good weapons lol so I always die and never end up claiming it.
---
Probably because they cant just add a faction back in without a reason and you might dislike dont mean other didn't you don't have to the event it's just a community event
---
I'm still not as speedy as I am with a West Tek run, but slowly getting there with the Burrows. 
---
I tried to do my usual Burrows run yesterday but the manhole said [Inaccessible] Hoping it was just a case of having to reload server or something. Will have to see whether it works today
---
Sorry for not knowing, but are legendary perk cards out for everyone now, or just test server? Because I havent gotten one.
---
No?
---
Instigating is a "magic" effect, meaning it does a bugged amount of ridiculous damage if the weapon it's attached to deals damage fast enough. Shotguns can generally hit this due to multiple hits per shot. However, shotguns also act very buggy when dealing high amounts of damage.
---
The most consistent way to get around it is to just use V.A.T.S. One of my characters is also a sneak shotgunner, and I've never found anything more effective than sneaking around with a suppressed Instigating pump/combat shotgun and blasting things in V.A.T.S. Criminal levels of damage.
---
*Snaptails make sugar. Double amount given by green thumb 
---
*Cranberries (not diseased) grow in every bog forest and on a farm in the forest. Also double amount harvested with GT. 
---
*Boiled water. 
---
That’s all you need for the 25% exp bonus. You can run around the map and have 20+ cranberry relish to stick in your fridge. You don’t have to hunt for anything, the plants are always in the same spot and aren’t affected by other players.
---
I used to get 500, but I think duping ruined prices a bit.
---
A raider tree ??? Did i miss this 🤨
---
Exactly what I did and it doesn't take long to do either
---
The Brotherhood Was Meant To Kill Of The Scorched But Things Failed Thats One Of The Reasons Why Their Coming Back
---
Ok. I’m Xbox but uk. I’ll be on over the weekend. I’ll message when I am and help u out of your around
---
Switch to PS and I got u lol
---
Lvl 50 in The legendary run
---
What times do you play typically?
---
It's obtainable from the legendary run if I'm correct
---
This started on Wastelanders... you lot just started noticing now because now you play them for XP
---
Atlas will end up being nuked every time someone does the Colossal event from what I've seen. Not a good spot to camp as such.
---
Radiation Rumble is super easy you just need 3 people... and it gives toons of XP and legendarys
---
How's your build looking? Your build is more important than your gear 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
That's a helpful sight to figure out a build
---
&gt;All players currently not done buying everything will have to live with half finished armor and unmoddable Gauss weapons
---
Tbh that’s not far from how it could happen. Just ask the squirrel scouts...
---
Thats bad 😅 u can try to log off and log in then try again.
---
👍 ok
---
try the workshops on the left side of the map (tyler county dirt tracks, dump, nuclear plant). they seem to only get attacked by low level scorched, robots, hounds, and supermutants which arent too bad to kill even if you havent got much gear). also get bow recipe, bow and arrows are cheap to make and good until you find a legendary you like
---
I got a feral ghoul sample and put it in along with the t fuse but it won't work and is saying I don't have the correct blood even though I collected it from a ghoul. So Im at a standstill with the quest.
---
Yeah so the Rocksy quote no one got. Replace immersion with "loyalty " ... its whatvshecsays when this happens
---
I think this is how it's meant to be used, actually. Like SDstartingOut said in his point #1 above. I'm not on a PTS (barely have time to play most days anyway), but from what I've heard the system is desined for people to max maybe one card and have a few points toward a few others. I've noticed that the game is balanced for a casual player more than for a hard-core one (Deathclaws still worry me a bit, and I'm 126 or some such), and I suspect the legendary card system will be balanced much the same.
---
If your looking for disappearing bodies use the camera from the bucket list quest line. It will show the name of the enemy then you can loot it. Very helpful if bodies fall into the water.
---
We can't rebuild appalachia we are gonna fail at end no matter how many legacies or B2525 J2525 handmades fixer you got we are  500 people maybe  less than that and not like other npc we don't know much thing about world so yeah we need other people in wasteland to understand new world
---
I play some fallout radio stations on YouTube on my phone when I’m playing, they’ve got more songs and some of them have the DJ’s from the games like Free Dog or Mr New Vegas, and they don’t give your position away to mobs.
---
I screwed up and put a Red Asylum uniform in my vendor for a measly 50 caps when I was in a hurry last week. I only pulled it out of my stash to let Sophia wear it but then absent minded, I assigned it to the vendor instead...
---
Then I rushed off and joined a friend running events and forgot all about it. 
---
A full hour and half later we get back to my camp and he strolls over to check out my stuff. He literally screamed into the headset for me to "get back to camp quick!!" and pull it out. He's my irl best friend thankfully, as anyone else would've grabbed it and ran. 
---
I don't sell often, mainly putting junk in it just so players have a convenient fast travel point for making it up to Top of the World for the first time. (I'm at the base of the ski lift, my vending is up on the turnstyle.)
---
So I dodged it there big time! Had you been cruising around looking for deals...
---
Spend enough time down there and it suddenly all makes more sense.
---
i want to hang the mothman corpse i managed to kill the other day
---
I have both builds. The shotgun works at a range that is barely worth using compared to running up at snacking something. 
---
I still play both but the rifle/ commando kills faster and is more adaptable.
---
No...
---
I think this would be more appropriate for vendors, so I know that when I see 20 weapons it won't be a level 20 selling hunting rifles
---
I can't be mad at Bethesda for the way Fallout 76 has been managed. Hundreds of hours my cousin and I spent Share Playing Fallout 4 on PS4 cause we both wanted a co-op experience within the Fallout Universe. We were both hoping that the Fallout universe would get an ESO experience and we got that with 76, yeah sure many things could be improved and are being improved, but im just happy that we actually have the world to play in. I was there for the ESO launch and it took years for it to be what it is now, Fallout 76 which I see them changing the name in the future to something like Fallout Online. The game gets better with every update, maybe slower than we want it to, but we will get there.
---
Also yeah I don't get the self-important post about im leaving and giving a 3-page book about why? just fucking leave. You know how many reddits or games I've stopped playing/following cause the game got old. Destiny/Destiny 2, Animal Crossing Pocket Camp, Call of Duty just a couple this year.
---
There is also the option that they may give coins as season rewards - you never know.
---
You only see them once you’ve gotten far enough in that questline. They will say “enclave” next to them.
---
I did place it and it is glorious. Now I need you all to hand over your cork for reasons
---
Feel free to add me GT:Isofree. 
---
What times are you normally on?
---
Starched Gene's lvl 2 and healing factor mutation you'll never worry about stims you will be selling them. Also use chemist perk and dilute your stims.

Scorch killer receiver no longer adds a star.

So no it is not possible.

All hail the Legendary Chicken. So it was foretold by our ancestors that a hero would rise and save the world from nuclear war. Nuclear protection, go and cluck-it.

I'm disappointed that I can only build one coop.

Well.... i dont know what exactly could happen, but it would hurt. a lot.
---
First rule of being the ver weight in FO76.. there is no fast travel, only respawn. Blow yourself up and respawn at a teammate at radiation rumble.
---
Pitt accent?
---
They going to raise their kellers?
---
I like this idea. With all the bugs of placing blueprints though, I don't think it would work very well in reality.
---
Thank you. What a terrible system.
---
How do you still have 'place your camp' as an objective at your level? That's a Wasteland Wanderer.
---
It's cool on paper. Less so in game. 
---
I used to play an MMO called City of Heroes. 
---
In that game you leveled up by talking to a specific hero or villian in each zone. They were the franchises version of the Justice League or Avengers.
---
So you'd go to Miss Liberty in Atlas park to level up. She was static, like a statue. Always standing on her podium waiting to level you up but never moving. 
---
The Icons had specific outfits that weren't available to players, so they stood out more.
---
Then one day, the Icons started walking around and talking! It was the most surreal thing ever. Seeing an NPC suddenly come to life and have independence.
---
At first we thought it was new coding, that they were making the Icons active in the zone. 
---
Soon enough it became obvious that it was the Dev's interacting with us via the Icons. 
---
A few days later the Icons started giving out interesting gifts occasionally. A small buff here, a bit of influence (ingame currency) or such. 
---
Sometimes the Dev would initiate a zone wide event upon request. 
---
As word spread of the fact that Dev's walked among us, as easily recognizable toons...
---
Whenever one would be spotted, they'd get instantly swarmed by the entire server. 
---
You'd have literally hundreds of player heroes scrambling for a chance to get close to 'the legend' and perhaps a chance at a gift. 
---
The chat became nonstop announcements of dev sightings and rapid fire requests from them...
---
You'd see them walking with a throng of players surrounding them, feeding frenzy style. 
---
Needless to say, they had to stop as a result. 
---
So while it would be interesting to 'bump' into the Overseer out in the wilds, and actually interact with 'her', it would also be immersion breaking as the whole server surround her in a flash with a cacophony of requests/demands/complaints/praise etc.
---
I wouldn't bet on that. It's not Blood Eagle raiders I see instigating assaults on the Slocum's Joe across the street from my CAMP when it's Settler-held...
---
Huh... 
---
TIL. 
---
Thanks. :-)
---
You can barely see the Chickens, it's little more than a noise box unless you go to great lengths to raise it to eye level. My idea of rejigging my camp to a riverside freehold took a step backwards.
---
Can you imagine? It's just a bug that happened after wastelanders came out. That would be insane though, lol
---
It's been patched now. But that was a huge way they were duping it
---
WHY?! its 2020...companion apps were useless even when gta5 came out...why would you want to use something like that? There are ways to access your stash...and like the name says its a "stash" not a backpack...sometimes the ideas here just make me face palm...jeezzz
---
Can I submit my application to join the chicken guild here?
---
Future atom shop items? - the exact same tree, cage and skeleton with different variation of tatty clothing...each one a new purchase of course.
---
This. Takes me 30 seconds lol
---
Yeah, I couldn’t even move my own camp, so never mind setting someone else’s design down, but still.. in an ideal world..
---
I personally think they have designed this so there is no end. At least for several years to come!
---
The million dollar question will be whether you are still enjoying the journey and not just focusing on the goal and mindlessly grinding not having fun. Once that happens there's no point getting angry just play a different game.
---
High-Level areas with High-Level enemies will still be a high level for the low-level player. This One Wasteland benefits high-level people, when you visit areas like the Forest all i see is level 3, 5, 10 enemies. Now when you travel to said areas you will see enemies with levels the Cranberry has, but low level enemies with still see their current appropriate level.
---
If you take your level 3 friend to Cranberry he will still see level 40/50 plus enemies. One Wasteland benefits high-level players making the entire map balance for you to explore while still earning worthy XP and loot. I love the forest area, but it sucks when i go there everything is such a low level and I get 1xp per kill, now when i explore the area it will be with max level enemies for me. They explained how One Wasteland works in one of the Q&amp;A events they held a while back.
---
True. But the underlying problem persists. I'm only overwheight because I can't sell   
---
 purified water and convert the legendaries. We all understand weight and stash limits, they are fine. But artificial limits on shops and converters are clearly detrimental to the game experience and force you to log off.
---
Booo!! Take my downvote
---
I've placed candle under the foot. Those colds nights sure set in...
---
Sounds to me like you just have a problem managing your inventory and knowing when the resets are.
---
Actually, it sounds like YOUR problem. That you've never learned how to manage YOURSELF.
---
It's amazing how so many others are able to manage themselves, their stash, and everything. 
---
You play a game, knowing there are limitations from the start. It's part of the game design, to fit in with the world. And yet you can't learn how to play the within those limits. 
---
You Problem.
---
Yes.  They won't drop flux ingredients though.
---
I totally get that... making sure you knew the first rule of FO76. 😁
---
Exactly what i was going to say
---
Stay in the forest,toxic valley and ash heap and do quests and events there to gather some legendaries and caps. After you get some,you can either scrip them for a chance of a new one at the purveyor,or try going from camp to camp and see what they offer.
---
Want a battery farm?
---
I like making recipes and I think more people would sell and buy if there was something like this, it'd be great. There are definitely players out there willing to pay a premium for the time and effort it takes for some recipes.
---
I don't think they should remove the spoilage rate though. It prevents food from being a duped stackable. 
---
We should be able to plant all vegetable/plant/flowers that can be found in the world at our camp also. Cranberries anyone?
---
i didn't know this, thanks. i try to turn off the emitter, that sound gives me a headache and sometimes i usually fix the turret as well just cause i like to fix things.
---
IRRC they all are on a timer, a failed event counts as if no one participated and all following events get a 60 mins delay.
---
Might be just a rumor, but from what I see it just might be true.
---
And with those bugged events (Breach &amp; Clear, where the miners don't surface, Messenger, where the part is below the surface or the bot just doesn't move.)...
---
Is there really a market for water? I take water from player purifiers for free and I'm never below 100 bottles. Haven't bought water since I started playing and leave my own open for new players as I'm near V76.
---
Maybe they don't want you as a player.
---
A nice private world 4v4 with each team claiming half workshops. Then duking it out in the middle, gradually claiming the other team’a workshop till a timer runs out to see who has the most workshops claimed at the end.
---
That's personally my favorite thing to do in a corner.
---
I didn’t read all of this but I think I agree with you maybe. 
---
They aren’t supposed to be something high level players can just jump into and unlock all of them. They are supposed to be that thing we can continue to work toward, something not everyone will be able to get.
---
You just sell it to npc vendors. No body actually buys it
---
Ohh I see :)
---
24 hours*. Dailies refresh at 8pm EST. ;)
---
Yeah I had a look at somebodies CAMP yesterday, spotted that it gives fertiliser and thought well that's a bit crap!
---
Add in Raiders that don't want to be beholden to Meg anymore, too!
---
I'm happy they're unkillable though,  I lose my shit when some cruel bastard comes to my camp, and kills my brahmin. Its like, you're level 230 what do you need those two stupid pieces of brahmin meat for?
---
Yeah if it worked properly it would be cool. I imagine certain peoples plans would be highly sought after and other talented folks coming up in the game selling their blueprints for cheap to make a name for themselves.
---
so you claim you got to level 50 without having "the gear" to do so? the game THROWS gear at you. even without any legendary item you can get along. and aid and food just LIES around EVERYWHERE. you just have TO LOOK.
---
I've seen 600% budget camps, no lag at all!
---
Yup! I’d even consider buy official plans from the atom store
---
yeah but look at their vendors first if you need to. i've missed a few good buys by nukaporting away while trying to speed-compare four machines full of legendary effects =]
---
Sounds like you didn't listen to what he said. Sure, it sounds like he has some weight managemant problems but the core of his suggestion was the removal of limits. Please stop defending bs mechanics in a game and do yourself a favor. After all, YOU would profit from it, so why be negative about it?
---
Yes I know! I feel this Haha. I get so upset when my poor baby is killed... 
---
Or when he glitches and sinks into my floor before my eyes :(
---
Yes, you can make 300-500 caps in a 3 hour session selling to NPCs if you have many purifiers.
---
When they can just go to Flatwoods and kill a half dozen...
---
Well jel, spent a good 2 hours server hopping while ago to finally get my one and only pet,sid the sloth. He just randomly stopped appearing in my camp just haven't the heart to try again and it to just disappear again
---
I have been playing the game for awhile, I have never played the game more then 2 times a week sometimes just 1 day. I never said I didn’t have legendarys, I said I didn’t have the Med or resources to build a proper base. I never said anything about gear.
---
“On this week of Diners, Drive Ins, Deathclaws, and Dives with Ghoul Fieri...”
---
They’re still undergoing multiple rounds on the PTS, so no, not out yet. Given that the devs seem to keep tweaking around the edges, but not addressing the core issues players have with them, I’m not especially enthusiastic for their eventual unveiling.
---
Good idea and nice math. I'd do only one change - let's skip the middleman and award perk coins for level-ups. Your math shows that we'd get 45 perk coins for every 5 levels. So why bother with some card scrapping? Let's award players 9 perk coins per level after 50.
---
 Or maybe 10, to round it up and offset the cards earned prior to 50. This way the progression would start slower, but it would end a bit sooner (2700 = 270 levels. 270+50 = level 320 to max out all cards).
---
You can do it with just two if one of you gathers just to the point of 25 ore but holds onto it right until the end.  That person switches to defense after collecting the 25.  The other player needs to be able to kill/cripple ghouls quickly while you're getting that 25 ore.
---
It'a fun, yes. Until you get a stopping bug.
---
Don't know about you, but when I nuke WS and only get empty corpses, it's a failed nuke and no fun. Fasttravel? Sometime it works, but when I need 5 attempts I get the urge to go outside and beat a dog.
---
Selling your inventory too fast to the vendor? Dang bro, it's your fault that stashed items (not in the inventory) are now with the vendor.
---
Camp can not be placed? 5 times in a row? Screw this shit, I might try playing later, or not.
---
Damage done suddenly greatly decreased? Bro, you gotta strip naked and unequip every card, ft and get dressed. That'll fix you right up, it's easy :)
---
Or how about the fun when you have ammunition, yet the system says you don't? Right in the middle of a fight? Fun, right?
---
All that shit aside, I still think fo76 is fun, else I wouldn't play it.
---
I see fo76 as THE wasteland, where even the gamecode has mutated and I just have to deal with it...
---
they go and kill raiders, ferals, ect. and bring order to the wasteland, they recover tech to make protect the wastes and make sure it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. they are sort of authoritarian but it’s like marshall law, 1st apocalypse, then brotherhood comes in and brings order (because what raider is gonna stand a chance against an army of ppl in full power armor), then once chaos dies down the ppl can come together instead of killing each other over a few caps. they don’t even have an interest necessarily in controlling the way people live, their mission is to gather tech and kill hostiles. look at the DC and the work they did there
---
Shotguns always give crit per pellet. It's why they're great for crit challenges and medic's weapons.
---
It’s fucking hilarious troll hammer strikes again
---
I'd love to kill me some overseer!
---
With cat and dog head mounts
---
Woah.  Do you mean if there's an empty event (no one participates), we get a 60-minute delay on all events?   So MANY events are going without participation.   That could explain it.
---
If you’re not worried about treasury notes and just ‘events’ for Score, just claim a couple of workshops. A few mins later an event will pop to defend the workshop.... 👍🏼
---
Speaking of, what's with that medical supplies donation box in the Responders base in Grafton?
---
The scrapbox still doesn't solve the problem. Fallout First players still have to discard weapons and armor they might prefer to keep, and juggle weight management perk cards just like the rest of us.
---
For some reason, they want people to grind instead of play. They want people to spend hours and hours with inventory management. This aspect caused my friends to quit 76, so I'm pretty sure it's a bad idea.
---
Didnt think about that nice exp boost there XD I ber you learnt all the mods for those weapons too at that point
---
I wanted a dozen coops because chickens.
---
My Food and water stay where it is when I last log off.
---
I’d like to re-read it myself, but tbh I haven’t the first idea where to start looking. There have been so many suggestion threads for improving the game that you’d need to search by a very specific filter, and Reddit’s search feature isn’t the best to begin with. :(
---
It's set up like a mobile game. Currency caps, dailies, and time-gating creates the *illusion* of content and encourages logging in every day and for a long period. Lets say theres an average number of Atom Store purchases per login and per hour.. whatever those numbers are, the more hours and more logins result in more purchases (to an extent, and affected by other causes of course). The longer they keep you in their little rat maze, the more chance there is you will buy something. So they will drag it out in order to squeeze every cent out of you that they can.
---
But then you get the fact that a new player will likely spend more in the atom store (multiple bundles) than the average veteran player (a few small purchases here and there of new things or missed items) so player turnover is more profitable than player retention. That means they don't really have a monetary incentive to care if you are bored after a certain point, so the time-gating becomes the better option for them.
---
Hook them in for long enough to buy some bundles and a year of FO1st, then let them fade away. Doesn't matter if they play for that whole year. It just works.
---
I wasn't negative, nor did I defend the bs mechanics. Core issue is, OP didn't know when the reset time was, so you can't pick up a load of purified water to make you overemcumbered and then moan that it's Bethesda's fault - just don't pick up the water until it's reset time! I've genuinely never in hundreds of hours playing this game ever had a problem where I can't do content because I'm too overemcumbered, that's not Bethesda's fault, it's theirs.
---
Oh yes, it's so fun, taking notes on each one of the various resets present in the game. Showing them to the players must be an unachievable programming feat, no doubt.
---
About managing inventory... yes, I have a problem. I'm 150lbs underweight on session start and after 3 hours played the only place I can stash legendaries is... on the ground.
---
According to the Fallout wiki there are actually plans in the game data for a targeting lens, so they could just enable that (though it presumably lacks much zoom function, like the night vision).
---
Here's an intro to it:  
---
https://attackofthefanboy.com/guides/fallout-76-how-to-start-the-new-arrivals-how-to-meet-settlers-and-raiders/
---
Once you can access them, you'll want to do public events (they have a ! on the event indicator).   Save the T notes until you have 20, then start religiously cashing them in every 20 you can get because 20 is the max allowed per day.   The gold bullion that they purchased can be kept until 5000, so there's a lot of lead time on that.   Then once you get raiders/settlers to ally level, you can cash in on all that gb you've been collecting.  :)
---
Samesies
---
Maybe this is a glitch on xbox or something then.. really strange. Its been this way for me since the beginning.
---
I played Line In The Sand last night, was the worst lag experience in 76 I've had yet since launch. Also, I've noticed the fast travelling has had a few issues, takes a few tries to get it to actually do it.
---
I’m on PS4 I don’t know if this is a problem for Xbox though.
---
The game just runs fine. but you do have a hoarding problem here.
---
Ah, yes. She was a sweet old soul, wasn't she...
---
You can mostly do this now by scrolling through the public teams.  If I see two or three building teams with high level players I know I'm probably on a decent sever.
---
Okay, that's actually an angle I haven't though of and you can easily be right.
---
If any Legendary endgame progression system can be easily completed, then it would feel lame. It wouldn't feel legendary. Currently any level beyond 50 is just a number. In fact, gaining levels can be seen like punishment, because it makes the level-up challanges progressively more and more tedious. So some long-term carrot on the stick is needed.
---
IMO level 850 is still too much. That carrot is too far from the players, especially given the fact that we rarely see players that high so we'd naturally consider this level borderline unreachable. Something like 500 would be more reasonable. We occasionally meet some 500s and 400s aren't a rare sight. On the other side of the spectrum I wouldn't go below 300. 200s are quite frequent and with the season challanges we level up fast. Many players would blast through the legendary cards in months... This system should last years for most players.
---
I am on xbox and have never had that happen
---
Oops my bad. Switched it with the reset of the legendary exchange machines
---
Did it monday last week. Excessive grinding thanks to Covid. 
---
Herbivore buffs, no Unyielding.
---
Never doing that again.
---
I know that's disappointing, but   
---
Congrats on the kill!   That's an accomplishment.
---
    They aren't necessarily useless. A lot of people used them for quick access in games such as destiny, even in fallout 4 I felt it was quicker to use the app to switch weapons and armour and use chems. 
---
    And for the stash idea, it would prevent having to hunt down STASH when you're not at camp, and I don't think a STASH should magically teleport to random locations (such as train stations) but they do, just feel it would be a lot less time consuming ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Stop being a baby
---
Radiation rumble is ducking awesome
---
At one point before I switched my build around to do bloodied stealth commando I could get 600 with my base and ribeye steak and death claw steak.
---
👍🏻
---
Legendary perks are meant to be a long-term progression system. Something extra to reward the player for gaining levels. It's not about maxxing out a character, it's about having the levels beyond 50 feel more rewarding. If the legendary cards were done by level 200, then it would lose purpose.
---
They were lightweight binocs with a recon-style marking system. Helped to know where major threats were so you didn't get jumped unexpectedly.
---
Aye haha, so many different times to keep track off! Aaargh. HeHe.
---
Or are you going afk then getting booted from server
---
I bought a dozen donuts
---
No.
---
I love the coop. I figured it wouldn't give eggs, as there's no recipe that calls for chicken eggs. 
---
I did hope the chickens walked around outside the coop. Giving more life to my camp.
---
I second this. I went through an awkward phase where I was always low on everything. I set up camp near Charleston station and would take the power plant, landfill, airport, and lakeside cabins every day and it helped me a ton. 
---
Try to run a lot of the popular public events too.
---
It happens to me too (xbox).
---
&gt; The stupid stash size limit is contrary to the design of a junk hoarding game. 
---
I was referring to just Junk not the other stuff.
---
Well, that just makes sense. Thank you for your detailed and coherent answer.
---
strain on the server? my man have you ever fast traveled to some other players camp or even your own camp and see it isn't present there currently and popping up part by part as the seconds go by
---
That’s awesome. Always wholesome.  I’ve tried dropping gifts at least 10 times this week to people lower than level 10 and they have all ignored me and walked off.  They didn’t even look at the package. Even though I was giving them non stop gift emotes.  So I have my gifts stashed for the next person who is lucky enough to check.
---
Yes :/
---
Are there any prizes worth caring about? Thanks, I was just scratching the surface on the new currency last night when I noticed the exchanger at the Settler camp.
---
It's no THEIR problem, it's YOUR problem.
---
The game gives you 800 stash and 300+ carry weight and it's up to you to manage it. Yes the daily scrip scrap limit should be raised (I favour 400 as its the max you can get from a 1k Murms seesion) but that won't do a blind but of good if you can't manage your hoarding and occasionally make tough decisions like selling legendary items to vendors or even dropping them. God forbid you could even gift them to low level players.
---
I *almost* pulled it off solo - only reason I didn't was I ran out of scrap to repair the turrets with about a minute to go. I mean, granted, three of the scavengers died, but that last one would have lived if I'd been able to repair the turrets one last time.
---
Good to know. I will try to get caught up with the campaign.
---
I haven't seen AWOL Armaments or Irrational Fear pop up in days. Two of my favorites.
---
With current buffs and nerfs, are there any stand out builds at the moment?
---
I have a melee character and a stealth rifle character. If I only pick one to move forward with in the current game for a bit, would one have an advantage?
---
&gt;I mean I try to do them but I have no good weapons lol so I always die and never end up claiming it.
---
So you didnt? Sorry to pin point on this. but even when playing only every now and then, there is no such thing as "no good gear" here in my experience. but thats not the point here. i just wanted to say, that on your way to level 50 you will find so much stuff that you have to start to throw away things at some point, or sell them at the vendor. with every single of my chars i can sell stims, radaway, purified water and chems en masse just by doing events. it depends on your style of play. dont rush the mainquest, do exploring every corner, look in every container. scrap weapons and armor and just everything that can be scrapped, and you wont have trouble with lack of materials. do events. even if you cant participate much, just being there gets you rewards. and about the base, truth be told, all you really need is the crafting stations and your stash box, and with the right place you dont even need all the stations to build.
---
No, I haven't. I play no more than an hour and a half a day the last few weeks and always have at least 2 of the public events start up.
---
I tend to sell what I know sells in my vendor, everything else to the robot vendors.  By doing this I very rarely hit my daily 1400 cap but still hit max caps pretty much every day. 
---
Being overweight and your stash being full is on you.  
---
The scrip limit is another matter entirely and should be increased  but I rarely find that it stops me from playing as my inventory and stash are being managed effectively.  Even then I tend to  transfer excess scrip to one of my mules to use another day when I don't have the time to play for long.
---
Yeah, I think they intentionally set the bar high, by doing so it gives them a buffer before they have to focus on making new legendary cards or adding in a new mechanics to keep us busy.  That means that they could then spend that time doing other things. 
---
Those other things have to be interesting enough to keep people playing and taking their mind off the grind.  Unfortunately, that’s where I feel Wastelanders failed and I worry about the next Update.  IF it’s just a quest line followed by a ton of daily grinding, then everything feels bad.  I’m \*hoping\* they learned from feedback, but I”m keeping my expectations under check.
---
i agree, many of the factions in fallout have been just one offs except for the brotherhood, it’d be cool to see how other factions are operating in different states
---
Finally! Someone with a similar sense of humour to me who isn't ashamed
---
&gt;And yet one of the most popular games of all time is eityher considered to be WoW or GTA
---
ok? I said a lot, not everyone. not even the majority.
---
&gt;As to the 'play however you like' its still true.
---
it is indeed, with the addendum: \*mmo bull\* still applies
---
that's been my point all along. a lot of people don't want the mmo bull\* to apply. you're arguing a losing point here, that the nauseating grind is a good thing, while ignoring the fact that a huge chunk of this particular playerbase despises it.
---
10mm explosive auto pistol or SMG. Tags with the explosion low damage cheap ammo.
---
Exactly.
---
The Crater raiders don't do "murder raids", but when raiding they don't care about killing. In Crater you can see ambient chatter about having to kill people and "it's not my fault they were not willing to give up their stuff".
---
Yeah, just place foundations below your stairs and cover the ground with them , it should detect them
---
Tbh. If you can’t grasp the basics of scavenging you’re not worthy of the Wasteland. There’s a lot of, left leaning, perspectives within the bright and sunny virtual Appalachian community however if you can’t survive you should do humanity a favour and play Minecraft
---
I sell them consistently in the Vendor for 100c.
---
For me the jetpack already doesn't show up on my character half the time so it's really not a big deal
---
I want a backpack skin that's a tool belt, or just a few pouches around the waist so I can wear outfits with logos on the back and actually see them.
---
Pause?
---
The suggested price is usually way too high, a better estimate is to start with the value a vendor will give you for it an work from there. Exceptions are good legendary weapons and certain rare plans and apparel. Unfortunately there is not a way to know by looking at it if something is rare or not. For example the Forest Camo Jumpsuit is valued at 6 caps but is one of the rarest items in the game. Or the fixer plan which is valued at 180 but player vendors sell for ~10000
---
I think water sells to the robots for 5 if you have high charisma, so you can only sell 280 to a robot a day. I have a camp right next to a train station where I sell water for 2 and stims for 7, that way if people need something to sell to the vendor they can just buy all my cheap water and stimpaks and turn around and profit. I sell the robots crap weapons and food and leave the water and stims for players.
---
at 10c plans sell very well in low level areas but not so well in high level areas, so I will often dump plans in suitcases in low level train stations. dont sell workbench plans, pearl handle revolver, moleminer gauntlet, mr handy buzzblade, water filter, these plans are so common they are worthless
---
5.56 and ec and fuel ammo sells quickly for 1, .45 less well, and the other ammos I dont find worth selling (I keep .308 and usually have a few hundred shotgun shells for 0). i generally don't sell nonlegendary weapons or armor.
---
I didn't even think it was positive.. thanks
---
Yes I’m entering the menu and pressing quit game
---
You can't convince me that that comment wasn't supposed to annoy op. It didn't even help with the discussion.
---
Glad im not the only one
---
Nope manually pressing quit most times
---
Using rejuvenated on endurance ?
---
In that case, maybe they can tweak it and work it out for next gen consoles, considering I have no doubt the game will be seeing an update for next gen.
---
Ya that happens to me all the time on my long time bloodied build, even when full on drink and food. Haven't figured it out
---
The trick is to kill them before they kill you
---
You just need to do some dedicated farming time every now and again - that's what higher levels tend to do on any RPG (unless you have masses of Caps burning a hole in your pocket). 
---
Put on perks such as Butcher's Bounty, Pharma farma, Can do and Woodchucker and just roam the Forest North to South. You won't need Combat perks at all here.
---
Gather all the soot flower, Snaptail reed, bloodleaf and firecap you can using Green Thumb. Then use Chemist for x2 and Super Duper to make Healing Salve and Disease Cures. Farm tick blood at Moonshiners shack and lumber Mill with Butcher's Bounty then use same doubling perks to make Stimpacks.
---
Finally pick up everything and scrap everything you come across on your travels making sure you have highlighted those raw materials you need especially in your Pip Boy.
---
believe radscorpion omlette will remove addictions
---
Yes, it's been like this since beta. But starting with patch 19 it got so that I died 3 times.
---
Tickets I placed were closed with "We tell the devs".
---
its a real chicken shit item.
---
Script, sell, trade.  The ones we sell can fund our next batch of recall cards (I bought 4 last night). Scripting gives us a chance to get something we want or need and the same with trading.
---
It happens even w/o that perk.
---
radscorpion egg omelet removes one random addiction, tasty radscorpion egg omelet removes all addictions
---
It happens when certain food buffs wear off
---
End
---
Some other people will, some other people won't.
---
There's no way to make everyone happy.  I've given my suggestion on the matter and how I feel about it.  Considering being able to build close together was basically in the game's marketting, I see it as a fair trade off especially when we get the larger instanced interiors.
---
As far as they're not going to do it... never say never.  They're constantly changing things.
---
Thank you. I will try to add more time to the game as well.
---
AHHHhhhh...Thanks
---
This.
---
First, our characters only know about the local BoS, which were a faction that heroically died trying to stop the Scorched. They were doing the best they could. They were shielding other factions from the plague, which other factions either ignored or underestimated. From what our characters know, the arrival of BoS would be a great news, because they would think "Great, more guys to actually fight the Scorched".
---
Second, tech-hoarding aspect of BoS developed overtime, when locked in isolation and smelling their own farts. In 76 we see that the founding principle of BoS was to be an independent armed force that ensures the survival of humanity and helps with rebuilding. They were gathering technology not for the purpose of taking it from the people, but for the purpose of preserving it for future rebuilding.
---
It was only in the upcomming decades where the policy of BoS became twisted. Instead of not trusting the government, they started mistrusting the wastelanders and taking the technology from them by force to "protect them from themselves".
---
Basically, the young BoS of 2103 are still the good guys.
---
Nah I didn’t eat rad scorp eggs it was just the blend removed the addiction for 60mins which is weird
---
The strange thing to me is I never see anyone head to AWOL Armaments.  I haven't been playing long, but this last week or so in general I see a lot of good events being ignored.
---
For example, when I started Guided Meditation would be packed with people wanting to kill all those ghouls for xp and loot.  The past few days the most I've seen there is two other people, and usually it's just me.
---
I would do a leave world back to main menu the. Quit
---
Hah, glad I'm not the only one that thinks of the TV channel every time an ITV is broadcast!
---
Yeah, if they do any other animal pen type items in the future I hope you get something other than fertilizer. I’m pretty much set on that.
---
I dont know, my highest level isnt even level 100 and I feel like excess cards is annoying. I'm not saying this is the fix, since switching points is now something that really hurts you in the long run. But yeah those extra cards are annoying
---
I'm using bloddied for 450+ levels and only time I had this happen to me was either because of chems boosting end or hp , or when I wasn't well Feed anymore using rejuvenated 乁( •_• )ㄏ
---
Well I'm not going to argue with you about it.
---
If Bethesda wants to figure out a way to do it, I personally would be grateful.  If they don't, they don't.  But there are ways around all the complaints and the playerbase can learn to adapt to any changes.
---
I'll continue to hope it will come with the instanced interiors and/or possibly the next gen update, but we shall see.
---
Doesn't need to be 200+ fire rate, but it helps.
---
It'll be the same. I really hope for a only weekly challenges season..
---
Once saw a legendary frog, he dropped a 35 lvl weapon
---
It's an alcoholic drink (it has bourbon in it: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sweetwater_special_blend)
---
Yeah the music is great, but after hundreds of hours of play it gets worn out. Fallout is great at introducing people to music that they might never have heard. I would love some new old songs.
---
I agree that 850 feels really high and is too much to max out 6 perks, but based on the math the OP provided, you’ll have 2 cards max around level 300.  That’s pretty reasonable.  I have a level 200 character, I could get him to level 300 pretty quickly. If it’s account wide, I’ve already surpassed that.  And if it’s account wide, the sum of all of my characters is over 400 right now and will be 500 by the time this patch hits. 
---
I know I keep going to the legendary stats in many of my posts, but I find them overall the most powerful of the cards since they give you the flexibility to do more. 2 maxed out cards (and still other cards at lower ranks) is still quite a powerboost.  Two stats that are dump stats with me are typically endurance and charisma.  +5 END will let characters that had other priorities slot Ironclad and/or fireproof for extra defense they didn’t have, +5 CHA will let me slot tenderizer on characters that didn’t have it, increasing DPS. On top of that I should still be able to have a rank 1 master infiltrator slotted that gives me the +3 hacking and +3 lockpicking.  
---
In my eyes, that’s a lot of extra “oomph” at level 300, and I’m not sure the daily ops is going to be enough challenge to \*need\* the extra power.  Sure, my bloodied build levels up super quick and has few risks and many things are super easy, but even on my full health sniper, my full health medic shotgun, and my hodgepodge unarmed - I don’t really have any problems except for the odd assaultron or too much damage from mr handy anti-armor attack. I can’t see anyone needing this extra power right now. 
---
So I know I sounded super positive and upbeat there, but to reign myself in, I still see a lot of flaws in the system.  There is a total lack of balance between the cards.  Exploding enemies seems fun but doesn’t come across as anywhere near the level of power as the others, and I’m not sure how many people will waste precious coins to find out.  850 does still seem too high, and clearly many people are upset - they could have done a much better job of rolling it out and perhaps a phased approach would have been better.  The ground work is in place.  But on the other hand, people may have rushed and then been upset that they “wasted“ time/coins if they later had more ranks they could have leveled up.  I hate that swapping cards takes a coin, I think that is a stupid idea, if I ranked up the card, just let me change them.  It’s nice for this system that perk card packs are in the score, but I hate that ranks are wasted by getting perk cards packs. 
---
TL:DR:  850 is unreasonable, but I think they wanted us to be closer to 2 maxed out cards which we hit at level 300.  With the current state of the game, we don’t even need 2 maxed out cards, or any of these cards at all, we are already too powerful.  They could have done a better job of explaining it, rolling it out, and balancing the effect.s
---
Does it affect perishables in your aid inventory too?
---
Oh I see makes sense now, learn something new everyday! Thank you buddy
---
that's great!
---
Yes it does. Also yes I am pausing and actually going all the way down to quit and then it takes me to the main menu.
---
I reached lvl 91 yesterday. Just daily and weekly grind. I log in an hour after reset play for a few hours then log off. A quarter of the day to play not too bad. I'm happiest when I get lucky and I am done in 30 minutes. Those are sweet days. Then I just go play around and farm build.
---
Kinda with you but I wanted to rejoin to enclave and get me that sweet x02.
---
I have no interest in BoS
---
Ever see a post looking for 100 crimson flux? he needs to feed the BEAST that is Gauss Minigun. and it really is a BEAST. 
---
Shotgun is cheap to run and fun learning it's quirks. 
---
in the end you will get both eventually. Shottie 1st if you are not looking for a great heavy weapon immediately. Just please don't be the one shot legendary guy with it.
---
Turrets, Crops can creep up on you too!
---
That would cause the same issue.
---
Yeah, it does look weird seeing the jetpack flames come out of nowhere... Wish my jetpack would stop hiding
---
You know... that's such a horrible idea that Bethesda just might do it.
---
the scary thought is it dropped an ASSASSINS shotgun, thing must have been ready to rip and tear.
---
THE CHICKEN COMETH
---
I seem to recall a similar problem, I think one of the questions has the wrong answer.
---
Also the board goes through the wall if you have wallpaper 👍
---
It’s related to the Well Fed Buff, where your food levels are above 75%.  At 76% or higher, well fed gives you a bonus +25HP, when the you drop to 75% or lower, it acts like damage when you suddenly lose that +25 HP. 
---
This will also happen anytime that you have a food buff that either buffs your hit points directly, or gives you an endurance buff.
---
This does not seem to happen however when you have extra END or HP from chems, I don’t notice the sudden shock from “damage” when Buffout wears off.
---
Yes, this is what’s causing it: either well fed goes away or food buffs (I don’t notice it with chem buffs myself, but may not be paying attention) wear off.
---
Nope only have Radicool
---
I also don't use any drugs and I'm always well fed and hydrated
---
I really hope beth do the Enclave right if there's an Enclave DLC. Then I can have a proper evil character, the raiders are just, bland. They were so disappointing I scraped my evil character and just did the raider quest on my main.
---
We need chicken eggs in the game
---
I would like to put a camp fire beneath the cage
---
Well it's become 10000+ words since I last updated this xD
---
&gt; That won’t be a problem after perk loadouts. They could also keep the scrap system and have it give different rewards.
---
I can confirm.  After to starting to use the perk loadout mod, I have stopped noticing the crazy amounts of random cards.
---
I hope so too. Or at least long enough to entertain me until cyberpunk 2077 finally gets released
---
One time I saw a camp outside the vault that had tons of really common items for insane prices. Like ok, I get that he had the idea to try and scam new players but where did be think a fresh out of the vault lv.2 would get a crap ton of caps? It's like he was hoping a trust fund baby would tumble out of the bay and into his store... Weird. 🤣
---
This has been my story.
---
Combining legendary effects is an interesting idea. They could consolidate Slayers to bonus damage to all humanoids (humans, ghouls, super mutants and Scorched) and Hunters to all bugs, mirelurks, animals, and cyrptids.
---
Combine bloodied and berserkers for a REAL glass cannon.
---
Combine instigating and stalkers for top notch focused damage, but you can't just blast everything in VATS because it'll be spent.
---
Maybe rework mutants to do extra damage when you have higher negative effects (1% extra per mutation while running class freak 3, 2% per for rank 2, 3% per for running rank 1, and 5% extra damage per mutation if not running class freak)
---
Combining furious and executioners seems too op, so I guess leave them alone and I can't think of any others
---
God please yes. It is soul-destroying having to server hop over and over just to be able to craft 1 piece of armour let alone the dozens of pieces you need to craft to get a halfway decent set. There's no reason for the unnecessary limit.
---
Anyway it's not a bug as I don't get it unless the situations I mentioned above , something is giving you either a HP or End buff for sure just check your effects more often and I'm sure you'll notice something giving you more health
---
Could.possinbly add an option in to segregate a character or have it joined perhaps o.O for those who want the experience
---
Yeah, didn’t remove the addiction, just the Debuff. 
---
With Herbivore and Partyboy, you can get +12 Perception from sweetwater tea (for the moment at least)
---
&gt; when I wasn't well Feed anymore
---
I haven't thought of that one, I'll keep an eye on it. Thanks.
---
Exp buffs from herbivore+unyielding armor. When legendary run started i was around 150 lvl. It's simple when you getting around 800+ xp for 1 super mutant. It was fun to get 3-4 levels from single radiation rumble. Right now its not that easy to level up, but i dont see a problem
---
Or maybe a perk card that stops you firing bullets
---
Season 1 is speculated to end of the 15 (Mid September) they said, so the Patch will most likely be on the 29th. Giving two weeks in between.
---
I'm on level 87 with no bought levels and I have never done a nw quest, zorbo is 10-11spaces behind me still, also we have a double score comming up soon I believe too, so the run should be easily complete able
---
Inventory management is a core mechanic in the game. And it's not difficult at all.
---
You can do it. 
---
Sure your stash is full of junk not needed. want to hoard crap...FO1st is for you.
---
I assumed there were, but I'd just never found any Haha.
---
Everyone would love this but Beth will never do it because their prime directive is to get players to log in DAILY.
---
it sounds horrible, but when we think about how we have the 7600 hours challenge, it doesn’t seem unreasonable that’s what they did.
---
I’m just going to approach this that my goal should be 2 maxed cards. That’s what I should expect. Anything beyond would be a bonus
---
I got the minigun first and really liked it. Tri barrel for optimized dps. Bloodied one is a SBQ wrecker.
---
why tho
---
It'll only scale up for him, as I understand it. The enemies will be level 15-20 for you, and 62+ for him at the same time. Not sure how that works though, unless weapons turn from damage points to damage percentage, in which case your level 15 pipe gun will take almost as much hp off the enemy as his level 50 fixer...
---
And it’s working!!! Curse you Beth!! Curse you lol
---
Serendipity isn't op, the reason why people were.dying less before was due to a health regen exploit related to speed demon and any health bonus effect.
---
Still bugged. Felt like a 5 year old in front of the window of a closed candy shop with Ra Ra taking her sweet ass time to open the door to the PA armor. You'd think a half dozen frag grenades at the window might help jolt her to action but sadly not. Can't believe Bethesda would leave a main storyline quest riddled with bugs for so long.
---
Armour type doesn't matter as much as armour effects. But just for base armour heavy combat or scout are the best for a matching set. Though heavy leather legs, heavy metal arms, and a heavy combat chest will give you the best defence for a mixed set of standered armour
---
Though ss will be the best once you get there (I personally recommend solar or thorn with how Dr works in this game)
---
Was hoping for some free range eggs!
---
Now I’m dying to see the 3 star legendary beaver
---
Everything will still be scaled to you, but the level 300 will see enemies scaled to him.
---
Think of it as every enemy is instanced to the player looking at it. So if you're level 15 you see the enemy at an appropriate level, if he's level 300 he sees the enemy at an appropriate level...but you're both hitting the same target.
---
What's really happening is that damage is becoming a percentage behind the scenes (AFAIK). So the enemy does maybe 5% damage plus modifiers...so low level and high level are feeling it the same even though it does more damage to the high level character.
---
So I can halt my "Level up" challenge for the day, before the daily reset, and play a little longer.
---
Players will still get online daily to do the weeklies and all the scrip and rep grind.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I’m planning on reaching this anticlimatic milestone later today!
---
You're definetly right but I find the limits too limiting. I can make around 1500 caps a day just by selling water, food (only meat I get from events and quests, as I don't produce food in my camp) and excess materials. I can't even sell legendaries after a 3 hour session but I would't have a problem selling them if I still can get anything for them.
---
But hey, It's their design decision. u/Plagewiind has explained it perfectly and he's spot on. This is a PC game with mobile game mechanics. Lack  of replayable content (dungeons, raids, etc.) has forced the design team to focus on high-end rewards only obtainable after a very extended period of 1 hour-a-day smallish grinds. And that's it. They don't want you to play any more than that each day. They want you to come and visit often and through a very long span of time so you can see what's in the store.
---
Take a look at ESO. It's quite similar. It has a game store, stash limits, gold limits, many currencies, factions with reputation that you can grind every day... but it doesn't feel limiting at all. You can play all day long and still achieve something. You simply cannot do that here. It's clearly a well thought design decision.
---
The enclave is the reason everybody is dead. Even themselves.
---
This guy Gauss shotguns. Mine makes me feel powerful and powerless from one shot to the next but I just can't quit it.
---
Ah yes, I see what you did there, well played.
---
Ok sweet. One step closer to a wave bses gamemode or event.
---
But you did receive 500 atoms, right
---
All those super high level enemies for the 500 level character will be low level to the level 15 character. The same enemy will show different levels depending on the level of the player.
---
Geez.. n i just got the entire set. No wonder its like worst than me being unarmoured... the acid damage is like non-existance
---
"public event team leaders" are the leaders of public teams focused on doing events, not people currently doing a public event. while on a public team, you get a bonus, like building gives INT, casual gives Luck, etc. For the event teams the bonus is +25% exp gained from any event per person, including yourself, so with a full team you get double xp from events.
---
i would say it's well worth it even in solo play. many will join a public team and continue to do their own thing, just so they get the bonuses.
---
That was supposed to be a question. You get 500 atoms right?
---
Yes, I do believe we all take enough shit from Bethesda.
---
But at level 15 he was against a level 21 DC...so more or less at his level. But because he lacks all the perks he doesn't have much of a chance - ESPECIALLY on his first encounter with it. 
---
With experience when he fights one he would know the tactics and how to use cover etc. but that first time is a killer. Having someone to just lend a hand now and then isn't a bad thing.
---
I got 57 more goddamn rounds in this 4 round magazine.
---
Psycho is a hell of a drug
---
I completed it 3 days ago, bought nothing.
---
😁
---
100 meters or whatever the distance isn't that much to be honest. My cousin and i built our camps next to each other and i can be at his place in 2 seconds.
---
It will be interesting. I'm only level 106 and max level DCs will give me a tough fight if I'm not careful...although oddly sometimes I'll encounter other enemies...SBs, Sheepsquatch etc, and I can take them on with little damage...then I encounter a level 50 albino DC and he kills me in two swipes. 
---
Like you say though, should be an interesting update.
---
oh, i got downvoted, guess its because im not just bitching about wallpaper.
---
Really? I totally missed that then. I'll take a look - thanks!
---
It's actually lighter to just carry another frame!
---
I’m also on PS4 and notice my food and water levels are usually lower than when I last quit the game. They’re not completely depleted like OP, but definitely noticeable and I never understood why.
---
you're imposing what you know about the future BoS onto this group. fallout 4's brothethood sucked, 3's was overall good. who's to say what the new guys this far back in the timeline are like?
---
I second the last point. Get in the habit of not using vats and not charging a shot on legendaries with others around.
---
I use the time to check Twitter or Instagram, sometimes even the Reddit. Like right now, as i type this message lol.
---
I like your idea guys. I bet many builders would contribute. I myself put many hours in a one foundation mobile build that could be placed like a tent and i got it blueprinted part by part. You can check it out in my posts.
---
If you die right after the queen the flux automatically disappears from your bag. I've had my bag guarded by my team and it still vanishes. I always stash mine immediately before even going to loot her body.
---
Something I wasn't aware of at first is during active events you won't drop a bag if you die, so you don't need to worry about your junk getting stolen.
---
you could just play another character
---
-dress skeleton in halloween pirate outfit
---
-make sign that says "Pirates ye be warned"
---
-???
---
-profit
---
I just hang bone chimes from the, branches, and mount a snallygaster lit by candle light opposite so he doesn't get any sleep!
---
Seems like it's a server thing. One session they pop up often other times they never come up.
---
 Ive noticed that it seems like if an event is completed a new one pops up shortly after if its failed no more events pop for a while.
---
need some W.A.P. in the wasteland
---
(Wet Ass Public events)
---
How on earth would you be able to one shot max DC with non-legendary? Even with all the perks your damage isn't going to be that high?
---
And saying that your build is no good really doesn't help let's be honest because you're obviously leaving something out of your statement above.
---
For the level up. Make a new toon. Leave the vault. You’ll be level 2. Trot down to the overseers camp and you’ll level to 3. Job done. For some reason it doesn’t recognise 1-2 as a level
---
This
---
Or better yet, let us sell the whole camp as a whole. Blue printed houses/camps are quite impossible to relocate.
---
I am shocked anyone is having trouble finding matches during the season given the daily challenges. I always am placed immediately. Maybe it’s because I’m on Xbox or the time of day. Either way, never have a problem. I wonder why that is.
---
The advantage of a full solo mode is you are not fighting vs a teams.
---
I want BoS, Enclave, proper raiders (not we are your friends and we welkom everybody bland faction we have now.) Free states (Would be cool if there are some free states still hiding. A bunker complex maybe). Basically I just wan't more content. Unfortunately I can't see the responders returning, they all died. Would be cool if settlers took up the responder mantle though.
---
For the features of the armor? You do know vault armor is more than a cosmetic thing right?
---
And me xbox
---
I cant wait all the other factions are Aussies
---
It all depends on the level and the second 2 effects on the shotgun. I mean whoopty Doo if it's a 1 star and less if it's low level
---
true.  Just relaying a faster method of checking what you may already have.
---
I get my weeklies done in one day so I can spend less time in the week doing shitty boring challenges.
---
That would actually be an amazing solution. Kill 40 Legendary Enemies for 3,000 SCORE, you can either do them in 1 day or scattered them through the week.
---
Level up 10 Times.
---
Claim 20 Workshops.
---
etc...
---
not needed. once you get past 100, for me 115, you will be accumulating more perk points than you spend.
---
so respec, changing build is not an issue.
---
Myself and a lot of other people I'm sure are using low level alts to quickly complete the level up daily challenges.  If someone offered me stuff on one of these alts I would refuse to take it as well considering I will be deleting that character in a day or 2 anyways.
---
Mirv mod?
---
I managed to avoid this
---
Hell, I'm 126 and still have trouble with some enemies. I refuse to go Bloodied because I'm a casual player (who has a 40+hour job and a family), and I can't be arsed to micromanage my health that finely.
---
Hehe your welcome, maybe for you its good; let us know
---
It sounds like you just don’t know how to manage your inventory...
---
Eggs or meat for soup would be amazing, but I fully expected shit. At least it's max is 10 and can't be randomly killed.
---
If it is “mobile” mechanics there would be a way to spend money to bypass the daily limits.
---
Although I have something expensive, it's for people over level 50. For Level 2 newcomers, I put some free items in the vending machine
---
Just adopted the Railway Rifle as a preferred,
---
But then they would have to split their player base between next Gen and OG which is not a smart move in an online multi-player game. Their fallout shelter feature is going to try and fix this in the future by adding a camp that is instanced. But tbh this is all just temporary measures until they officially release mod support. This game has the potential to become truly amazing once the modders get a hold of it, just like they evalated skyrim and fallout 4 to become some of the best games on the market in my opinion, and since most mods are able to be ported forward from fallout 4 to 76 we don't even have to wait for mods being made.
---
It's not the multiple players filbertsnuts is complaining about: I'm sure they're perfectly okay with the ones who wait a bit so everyone interested can tag legendaries. It's the jerks (admittedly, they're in every MMO in one shape or another) who 'port in to kill-steal the legendary and then bounce that they dislike.
---
Except for The Messenger, it seems no matter when I log in to the game, I get The Messenger repeatedly, once in The Ash Heap, then a few minutes later in The Mire, then The Forest, then back in The Ash Heap. I honestly give two shits whether or not that damned 'bot can deliver his lame message.
---
I don’t know how this mechanic would work but I agree it would be nice to at least share blueprints with teammates. This would benefit NW as well and lead to some very interesting matches.
---
Exactly. It already takes about 10-20 seconds for my camp to load when there's another camp or two near me.
---
are you SURE we’d profit from it, have you done a deep look into what the state of the game, the economy, what would keep people playing if all limits were removed.
---
Or do you just think removing all limits would have no impact on the rest of the game, and people would happily just keep playing and nothing would be wrong?
---
Mine goes down some. I'm never fully depleted (xbox)
---
&gt; With 60 intelligence
---
What?!
---
I thought 15 was the max you could have in one perk? What am I missing?
---
I think I love you 😂😂 thanks worked great for me
---
God no, both stories will co-exist. Just like how the vanilla story co-exists with the Wastelanders story.
---
Maybe but it's definitely gotten a lot worse since the last update. It seems like we're lucky to see more than one non-highlighted event at a time. Highlighted events used to happen almost back-to-back as they were intended but stopped all of a sudden.
---
Was this on PC? Cause I was on a dropping plan spree tonight
---
It's not, it's a visual glitch from NW.
---
If you have the Super Duper perk on when you drop a nuke, this happens.
---
Oh I see, thank you :)
---
It’s a visual bug. It happens all the time for me.
---
I obliterated a level 68 Three Star Legendary Feral yesterday (Level 323) only to find that it's inventory was empty, nothing, not even a radaway it then despawned into the ether.
---
level up 10 times is kind of steep for high level players - in the 220s, I'm doing good to achieve the current weekly level up 3x challenge.
---
Ah yes....u r correct...my bad...
---
But the claim tokens rewards r trash
---
Don't know why people don't do Guided anymore. It's super easy xp and the more people who do it, the more ghouls that spawn.
---
So anyway I started blasting
---
uhh. yeah
---
You can't simply throw out the limits and expect the game to play as it does today - yes there's issues but in general even multiplayer battles (usually) run smoothly. 
---
Calls for infinite cap allowances, stash, carry weigh, camp budget etc miss out on the simple fact that it's all data that has to move between player and server, and often other players too...too much data and even a fast connection will stutter as it hits lag limitations when operating in near real time.
---
My current character has 800 stash, 370 carry, and often picks up well above the scrip scrap limit every day. And yet despite often hitting weight limits still manages to continue playing. People hoard, they overvalue legendaries, refuse to swap out damage perks for weight reduction even temporarily, and essentially often cause themselves more problems than the game mechanics by refusing to simply drop stuff.
---
My friend and I call that 'I stubbed my toe' or 'ouch my back'. Thanks for the info as I know now it may be food related
---
Yeah I've noticed it's much worse as well. Seems to be when I'm in the middle of an event too. Can't figure it out as it was running smooth as butter before.
---
I can almost guarantee they were already going to split their player base between next gen and OG so as to take advantage of next gen technology.  They weren't going to handicap themselves by attempting to support cross play between them.
---
The same thing happened with GTA V when it moved from PS3/XB360 to PS4/XB1 and is going to happen again with the move to PS5/XBSX, with the older consoles eventually losing online support altogether.
---
Iirc they mentioned before that every enemy has a minimum and a maximum for scaling.
---
Hm interesting. I have discord set to open on startup, maybe closing that would help somehow?  I never really thought that could hinder performance that bad so I didn't even try closing it lol. I'll give it a try tonight and see how it goes.
---
Nice. Yeah I’ve never been a big fan of power armor in any Fallout games, I prefer using the CSS and most my guns are suppressed. My favorite is my instigating suppressor gauss rifle. I gotta junkie plasma caster(2 days ago) n automatic laser rifle for when I gotta battle when I’m not in stealth mode. I even used a mod in Fallout 4 to use the CSS lol.
---
YouTube
---
one way to get extra stims would be to use the luck perk, pharma farma, all med boxes should have the option to perform a search for another chance at finding something.
---
crafting them isn't that difficult either, pickup every blood pack you find and its imply 2 antiseptic 1 blood pack and 1 steel. if you use super duper (which you should when you're crafting any consumables) you get procs for double crafts. then if things are real tight just dilute the stims. so 1 becomes 2 diluted.
---
Or stop playing and engage in real life.
---
I tried that once, thought I'd done it too, then I realized I'd forgotten that toxic storage place way down on the southern portion of the map ugh.
---
I named mine. I keep them next to raider punk’s cage.
---
I generally use building teams.  Gives an XP bonus, increased after the group is bonded/linked ( for each bond, the bonus goes up)
---
for an ad hoc group, if you can get together in the same location for a couple of minutes, then each one of you uses one of the legendary run lunchboxes, you can get some big bonuses.  (for example, at least one of the lunchboxes gives a 25% XP bonus to everyone in the group for an hour.)
---
Wow, i hope this was an attempt at comedy
---
There's 40, actually!
---
They said we would be able to do this. It was a question about towns/settlements before the game came out. Im sure they did not know the huge lag problems back then playing on locally hosted servers. I would like to see it though.
---
It not a bad thing to lend a helping hand and it will still be possible It will just be challenging for everyone in the group. 
---
I understand what you saying but understand that this update overall would be better for the game and community. It make the game more fun and challenging 
---
Not a bloodie build simulator lol
---
A few depending on if you care about cosmetics. There are also a few scrip/atom rewards.
---
Lunch boxes are also amazing, they give you and anyone nearby +25% for an hour and stack up to 100
---
The fireworks mine is also bugged and dramatically increases your reload speed when equiped.
---
Here's a list of all the prizes.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
To be fair, the Brahmin would get killed constantly. Even if it were inside on a second or third floor, a mole rat or rad scorpion would find a way
---
With One Wasteland, this one is going to be level 250 :D
---
I'm more concerned about your moms meth basement tbh
---
It is! The load out should be under the video details and also discussed in the video.
---
Should have tamed it and brought it back to your camp!
---
Exactly.  I know it will take a lot of optimizing to make happen - but that's no excuse for it to not eventually happen, IMO.
---
With a bloodied build and a set of unyielding armor, I haven’t had any trouble with SPECIAL checks. On my alt though, could barely pass any of them.
---
Same. I hope she has good prices
---
too bad you can't make fuel with it. enjoy while it lasts. someone planted a few of those things in my camp and I'm livid.
---
I don't think Bethesda is gonna take actions against people, not after the last debacle. but I still value my account way too much to risk it. manage to scrap them but my budget is now eternally 1% smaller :(
---
Damn no wonder my bloodied 50 crit damage gauss shotty is so powerful with crits
---
Same reason there no point in lvling pass lvl50 in the current version of the game
---
As in a master liberator that spawns the normal liberators by the bucket load? Could be a story line that ends in an event, as in track down where these liberators are coming from and destroy the source, you get there and a massive liberator rises out of the ground spawning liberators say 20 every minute??? You have to take down the master liberator along side the smaller ones? Master liberator could have some sort of plasma cannon or something? Could end up like an SBQ fight with almost the whole map involved?
---
It’s odd that you call the brotherhood useless for your “hero” role play or whatever, then you say you’d like to support the free states. The brotherhood are coming to help deal with the scorched plague, which is responsible for the destruction or near destruction of every faction in the game. While I love the brotherhood and have eagerly prepared for their arrival, I would do the same for any other faction, whether or not I like them.
---
She doesn't ask for cash, put it that way... ;)
---
If they did this then they’d have to make the old daily challenges more difficult/time consuming. Also if they did this then there’s only be incentive to play a day or two a week to get these done
---
Don’t speak for everybody. There’s downsides to this as well, which I think outweigh the good
---
Yea I’m pretty sure try without using vats and see what the the damage is when you get the bonus damage
---
Yeah, one of my fondest memories of this game is wandering too far and being bodied by a group of level 65 charred feral ghouls.
---
The budget complaint is utter BS. Move the camp once or twice and your budget is back. People spreading that so people stop using em.
---
That would make their scrap kit irrelevant and add game breaking bugs
---
I honestly didn't think about that. I'd guess its to stop people locking themselves out of content. I know this might sound funny today but Morrowind did have a lot of backlash over killing story characters. Plus today people definition of gating content is literally just being a skill point off. I'd imagine Bethesda is just going to play it safe.
---
I moved it a couple times but the 1% is still there. does it actually work? I could try a couple more times, although placing all my stuff back down is a chore.
---
could be some other bug too I guess.
---
If that were the case then why bother at all? They're seemingly putting in a lot of effort into this and also giving us 6! Legendary perk slots and dozens of perk cards to chose from.
---
Personally, I don't feel like any of those are that game breakingly good. (Except the ammo one)
---
The extra special ones effectly just increase the level cap and allow you to select more regular perk cards, but you're still limited to 15 points. If they pushed your special up to 20?  Definitely.
---
I don't know...on one hand yes it will open up more of the map to more levels, on the other hand I actually like the gradual change of levels from the forest to the bog...I don't think it's a bad thing that low level characters maybe shouldn't be exploring the bog until they have the experience. As well as the fact that going back to the forest for something leaves a high level character with that feeling of being high level...you don't have to worry much about the enemies as they're not really a threat anymore, this changes with the new system.
---
It's a tough balancing act...make the map more open and challenging but take away that feeling of having experience and high levels by taking away low level enemies.
---
It'll be interesting to see how it works.
---
I don't run a bloody build...and while I am all for players being able to play whatever way they want it just seems a bit OP when you hear players talking about their 30-45 stats, being able to take lots of hits because of the perks that help at low health and hitting for 11K damage.
---
I don't want those players to lose playing the way they want...on the other hand I wouldn't mind seeing a balance that makes all builds work without being OP. Heaven help us when the devs decide that the next enemy has to be designed against the meta of bloody builds and it takes a non-bloody build an hour to fight them.
---
I'd be happy if I could place my own fkn blueprint after moving camps.
---
maybe they wanted new players in game and wanted to get rid of old players so servers loads can be downsized
---
Ok, let’s take the example of removing all the limits: Caps, Stash, Scrip, etc. 
---
As a player I log in and go do Uranium Fever.  With no limits, I can pick up every single thing that drops and trudge out of there and wattle my way to the train station.  I scrap or sell everything - bulking up scrap I don’t need and stashing anything I want - glowing meat for later food, tons of ammo, and all the scrap I want.  I scrip all the legendaries.  
---
I can do this a few more times.  Now I have all the scrap I could want, I’m overloaded with Caps, and I have lots of scrip. I go to the purveyor and keep chugging along trying to get some good legendaries.  Since I have no restrictions I can try this endlessly all day.
---
Now I return to my camp, stash overflowing with stuff, and I set up my vendor, not that I necessarily need to because I can endlessly earn caps all day and get myself into the millions just with the vendors...but let’s say I think it would be neat to sell some scrap. 
---
But no one comes.  Why? Because with all caps removed, EVERYONE is overflowing with scrap and stuff in their stash.  EVERYONE has already used thousands of scrip to get incredibly good gear.  No one needs to buy chems, cola, or anything else, since you never had to worry about the stash limit and you just shove EVERYTHING in there. We already see this with Scrap as people with 1st never need to buy scrap from other players. 
---
The only things out there on the market are good legendary weapons and armor, and they would be priced at outrageous levels since we could endlessly earn caps.  
---
Hardcore players who can play all day have levels of caps that no casual or new player could ever hope to achieve.  
---
It’s completely destroyed the economy, and we know this would happen by looking at pretty much every other MMO that doesn’t have money limits or money sinks.  
---
Now maybe the limits could be higher.  Maybe they could move the limits to weekly updates so it’s not so bad.  But to say that it would be all sunshine and cuddles if we removed all the limits is flat out wrong, and we have other games to use as evidence of the case.  I mean look at WoW - the price of some items was so high that people wanted to buy (with real money) gold from third party sites just so they could afford it.
---
My Stealth rifleman b25/25 or hunters explosive fixers can do insane damage 3.5x for sneak shots
---
it is. the message doesn't always show. but keep in mind the sneak multiplier doesn't trigger if your target is in combat with something.
---
for example, the SBQ. if there are other players around, or even if she's fighting some random mob in the area, you'll be dealing regular damage.
---
I have seen a bunch in my.... friends build, he moves his camp often and hasn't had issues. Never seen any stuck % from the factories. Id try moving it once or twice. There is also a current build glitch to remove %, if your game is stuck like that.... maybe worth doing to remove the 1%.
---
Honestly the best method would be a "catch up" mechanic that refreshed your dailies till you caught up to their projected adverage.
---
If you are having trouble surviving, then I would speculate:
---
1. you power leveled to 50.  You missed out on lots of quests to earn both weapons and armor.  go back and do things like miner miracles quest, join the Bos, responders, and firebreathers.   
---
2. your perks and weapons are not coordinated.  If you are carrying a machete, but have no STR/melee perks, you are not going to deal much damage to high level critters, and you will die a lot.  Alternately, you are using a low level weapon in a high level area.
---
3. Especially at lower levels, you were traveling into areas you should not be.  For example, a L20 will have a very difficult time surviving long in the mire and bog)
---
4. you need better armor.  Crafting, event rewards
---
Explore and loot the hangars at morgantown airport and/or the medical center in charleston.
---
for mats, loot everything you kill, scrap everything.  you'll have more mats than you know what to do with.
---
I also have noticed lately that there are times when I see no event on the map for 30-45 minutes... We need more frequent events for sure!
---
Bethesda.
---
What is the ash pile issue?
---
I love you a little.
---
I havent taken the run so seriously. But some if the camp items is nice, but the ghillie skin does look a bit off.
---
None
---
Is just a display bug. Even if the multiplier doesn't pop up while in vats, you still deal the extra damage
---
Tru
---
act like you dont have multiple characters lol
---
\
---
That’s never happened for me that I can recall
---
less talking more music
---
Literally no one downvotes this. Everyone’s tired of the Purveyor’s limits.
---
How does the destroy/rebuid thing work?
---
I'm okay with no sweater/dress if I can get a nice head-shrine
---
Yeah, that’s definitely not normal.  The aura is more or less identical to a Tesla coil torso mod from my experience.  It’s not a tremendous amount of damage, but it’s there.  Versus max level ghouls, you can see their health slowly draining.  I’d guess it would take 2-3 minutes to kill a lvl 68 charred ghoul with AoE.
---
I'd also hit the airport on the hill by Charleston Station, that one was the very first workshop I ever claimed, it has only low level Super Mutants and a guaranteed spawn of a suit of T51PA not to mention all the scrap available even a low level pipe pistol should be enough to take that one.
---
Lol honestly the main thing I cared about was the almost unbelievably cute Giant Sheepsquatch Plushie. I grounded for that and after that I kinda lost interest
---
This is a great suggestion. They made this go from a game being played for fun into a second job having to log in every single day. I hated it. 
---
One thing they could do is make dailies with atom rewards again. Just smaller amounts than before maybe. This should make everyone happy with the changes they made to daily and weekly challenges and still accomplish what Bethesda wants.
---
Exactly.  Extremely low chance at lvl 1, but it’s possible.
---
They die last, every battle needs some ambient tunes
---
What? This is not true. As long as you are at caution, it doesn't matter if the enemy is in combat, you still get your sneak damage applied if YOU aren't in combat.
---
Many of the perks are still very good even at rank 1.  Master Infiltrator, at rank 1, will give you +3 lockpicking, +3 hacking, and Auto Unlock anything rank 0.  That’s amazing.  That’s the passive lockpicking/hacking perk people have wanted.  I’m going to have that slotted on all my characters.  
---
The legendary special perks are amazing, even though you’re still capped at 15, that’s 5 points you don’t need to dedicate to that SPECIAL when building your character.  That will open up so many builds and increase the power of existing builds by quite a bit.  For many characters CHA is a dump stat with no more than 4 for lone wanderer, there just wasn’t room in the build. Just adding a +1 CHA to get tenderizer can help with DPS.  
---
I think the reason is the middle of the road.  Our current state is no legendary cards.  The end of the yellow brick road is 6 cards all rank 5.  The sweet spot is somewhere in between, two cards maxed out and 4 other cards at lower ranks is still going to be quite a bit added onto the characters.  I could see myself with Rank 1 master infiltrator, +5 END (since I always dump END) and +5 luck for some of the more utility cards and to boost the rate of my crits (which will in turn, up my DPS)
---
The more I’ve been thinking of it, that doesn’t seem too bad.
---
Had a pretty good run the other day. I got two 3* fixers in a row from madam mumbles. One was reduced weight explosive bloodied and the other was a medics. I also got a 3* bloodied lmg and a 3* TSE lever action in the same trip. Sadly I don't play bloodied but they will be good for trading at some point.
---
I'm sure by level 600 you would know the plan for fixers so you have them in the loot pool? Probably.
---
Just FYI: Stingwing Filet weighs less than Death Claw Steak and gives same bonus. Every bit counts!
---
Xbox? ugh Sorry I can't be of help I have literally hundreds of stimpacks and building materials I could give you, but I'm on PC.
---
Mega Ultra Chicken? No! Shhh... He is legend.
---
I heard that it used to spawn Super mutants. Maybe that's why some people ignore it now.
---
This would also be nice for when I'm deciding if I should try to take over a workshop owned by another player.
---
That happens to me as well.
---
You’re surprised you got shit from this game? 
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Congrats, you're free from the grind !
---
I solo'd Uranium fever today on a public server. Thats never happend for me before. Theres usually heaps turn up for it
---
Spent 1200 scrip in the last two weeks on 3\* melee - 3 shovels, 1 pick, 1 pitchfork, 1 bowie knife, 2 switchblades, 1 lead pipe, 1 pool cue, 2 pipe wrench.
---
Yeah...this character is an unarmed melee and I get construction and plumbing equipment.
---
Should look like this.

Humble brag
---
I'd rather have it like this yeah. Remove atoms from season rewards and put them back into dailies, even if it's smaller ammounts. And keep weeklies for score
---
Once you join the Enclave as part of the main quest they will pop up.   I see them all the time in Harper Ferry’s as my camp is very nearby.
---
I used to avoid it because I hate charred ghouls. I have a better build and equipment now. Its my favourite event. Lots of xp and often legendaries
---
I like the game and really don't have any real complaints. 
---
I couldn't ever make a game, so I mean it's all cool to me Haha. 
---
I was just disappointed for no eggies.
---
Silly question but did you go into each folder and specifically pull out those files and throw those .ba2 files? If so where did you put them?
---
Also, make sure there's no spaces/enter between them. Should be a constant string. (Atleast that worked for me
---
I'm just replying to your topish comment to say:
---
I like it. It looks nice on my little balcony farm.
---
That's not true. I for sure get sneak damage on the sbq while she's attacking. The only time it bugs out is when the hidden/caution doesnt appear, as if I'm not crouching at all. I assume that happens because of lag.
---
this, people are stretching to try to demonize a game mechanic. We can’t pay to refresh the scrip or caps at a vendor.
---
It’s NOT a mobile game mechanic
---
I'm out of the loop, is the ammo factory an in-game item or something more... unofficial.
---
Level 168 here. Been doing the new character level up shortcut for the last 2 weeks. At the amount of time I play, I level up with my main maybe three times a week .
---
Thanks, btw I wandered into that pink tree area in the bottom-right corner of the map and found the colossus. Luckily there was another guy with tons of ammo and we (he) took out the colossus. He kept on spawning wendigos so it was tough to say the least
---
Great, good to know.

I see no reason why that shouldn't also work for Ecological Balance and the Forest instead of Queen of the Hunt and the Mire.
---
Are you playing via gamepass or steam?
---
Where is your ini located?
---
After Wastelanders dropped I just figured that that Chinese base was the source of the never ending waves  of Liberators before that was Mama Dolce's though I'm guessing that there's still another secret Chinese base somewhere in Appalachia, Jen's mom said that her boss sometimes came through on an inspection and that we didn't want to meet him. So that could mean yet another hidden base,
---
Except the rates of grind seem to indicate that we do matter.  That's why the amounts are what they are.  It's because we spend money and play the game.  We support the game and enjoy it.  Not whine like a bitch when it feels hard.
---
Responders paramedic jumpsuit
---
You are right, everything doesn't need to be done fast.  Then everyone is complaining that there is nothing else to do, hence the grind to keep you playing.   I will be level 400 by the time these come out and it will mean little work for me, but lower levels will and that is good
---
It wood be nice to have a food canning/processing system which required the food to be canned and 1 steel. Once it was canned it's non perishable like existing canned food
---
Lol I enjoy the game as well. 
---
Was just making a joke.
---
unless they *just* fixed it, and I'm pretty sure they didn't, it is true.
---
feel free to test it yourself. find a mob that's in combat with something else and note the damage dealt in both cases. the mirelurk queen near watoga station has 2 blood eagle neighbors that always attack her, and there's a couple radstags in the golf house that can be baited to fight the ghouls. or just by WS' main gate I guess, super mutants always attack the robots.
---
If you don't have any going on,I think they are random. Otherwise if you always want the same,you can simply activate and then stop tracking all the others in that area. This way you're guaranteed to have the same each day. I usually keep all the ones I don't like doing at their last stage,in case I need some exp or something.
---
it is not set up like a mobile game, if it was the first thing you see was “want more scrip, spend 150 atoms to refresh the machine”. There are many, many, MANY games that had time gates before mobile phones were more than a big bag with a corded phone to it.
---
I'd rather they give basic binoculars a zoom function before anything else.
---
Lol I enjoy the game as well. Just making a punny joke.
---
I think of it like this; If a couple hours of real world work times saves me dozens upon dozens of grinding hours in game time... I'm just going to complete the rest of the legendary board with atoms. There's no "purist" grind reward challenge, people have to live their lives outside of games.
---
I think they were talking about the instanced “bunker entrance” camp feature that is coming soon. At no cost.
---
You realize Bethesda is a business, right?
---
I use the lucky hole mine for lead, with excavator armor and get more than I know what to do with. Steel is super easy as long as you're missing scrapper and scrapping weapons.
---
Then use the ammo and duper perk cards and it helps a lot.
---
Don't disagree with the general assessment here - my overall question is what is Bethesda going to do to give the 'legendary' players more challenge/reward? The game is really easy as it stands with all events solo-able with a good build. I'd love to see 'legendary servers' where you need to be a certain level/have a certain number of legendary perks to join. All enemies are twice a tough/tanky do more damage and the xp and loot is better as a result. This gives a point to the grind. I am sufficiently powerful for all content now, so why the grind? I want to do, I aim to unlock all 6 legendary perks and max them out - but once done will there be anything left to achieve/do? (note main character currently level 712 with 4 alts between 110 and 300)
---
I want the jet blast to come out of the seat of my pants too
---
Probably to encourage participation in all events; rather than vets faffing off and going afk until the "most efficient" events pop up, leaving newbs to run events alone and get bored and quit
---
like I just said to another user, feel free to check it out. I can attest it happens to me in my own private server even, if I don't clear out the bog before nuking the queen. she's gonna target a mirelurk group and my damage is instantly halved.
---
I also always notice this happening when farming the bog for exp, with the mirelurk queen that spawns in the farm by the station. she attacks the blood eagles and suddenly my damage is also halved.
---
I mean, I don't understand the system in place. But I did Campfire Tales and then I had these masks. /Shrug. This was a few months ago at this point. I don't know all the events offhand so I can't tell you what else it could've been. Lol

Strangler heart is pa. Solar and thorn are normal armours
---
It's an exploit.
---
60 seems long. I did manhunt twice on the same server 15 minutes apart, with two enclave events between. Maybe you're just missing the smaller events because people do them before you notice them. Some servers seem to not pop many events though too, but if that's the case i just server hop and usually the next one is better.
---
The problem is that everyone bitches about having to change perk cards every time they want to hack or pick a lock.  Beth does listen all be it at a low level but this will be a positive step forward.
---
U linked the wrong video then
---
Perhaps a compromise solution where you have an extra 10 weeklies and only 2-3 dailies.
---
Yay castle and moat!
---
Hell; they're incredibly different even in the same region when a different leader takes over.
---
Like in 3 they were focused on building up infrastructure and sustainability, then little McShithead grew up, Cheney'd Lions in a "hunting accident", and turned them into some hilariously dumb poor-mans Imperium
---
It already does. It pops up in the corner whenever you unlock something through scrapping
---
According to the dataminers, they are supposed to be only available from Savage Divide events and from Messenger (any region) so you getting them from Camp Fire seems unlikely, it’s more likely that you noticed you had them after you completed Camp Fire Tales but got them from a previous event.
---
Perfect. Thank you!
---
I'm level 86 or so, haven't bought levels and stopped "trying" to do all the dailies when it became apparent I would make it to the end before the deadline, without having to go out of my way to do challenges (*glares at NW*). I do play a lot though. I have 0 life so ranking up on this is a breeze.
---
95% of the time I use public building teams for the XP boost.
---
FYI I started shooting at the ground where the mole miners were supposed to spawn and he/she rose from the ground and died. Not sure if this works all the time though.
---
Nah, fix the clipping issues by making the backpack magically float 6 inches away from my char's back .... oh, wait.
---
Happened to me and a few others last week. It’ll disappear from your quest list/go back to being “completed” after a while.
---
Mine was a Karen that couldn’t breath in a hazmat suit and didn’t need one anyway, the nukes falling and the radiation was just a Government conspiracy to control people and take away their freedoms. I like to think Karen gets all the fresh air they could want swinging in the breeze in that little metal freedom swing.
---
I think everyone's mileage varies with the allies. A pure silent one would be welcomed.
---
It pops up in the top left after scrapping. If you want to be told what you would get BEFORE scrapping then that's not really possible since mod unlocks are purely RNG based through scrapping.
---
I hope when they do fix it they give shotguns a boost at the same time. Having a magic shotgun feels like how a shotgun should actually work - they'd be fucking useless without the magic effect.
---
I feel like I've said this on a bunch of these posts...   
---
But you don't need every reward, the stuff at the end of the run is for those hardcore players that are able to dedicate more time to the SCORE grind. That's kind of the point of it being a challenge.
---
I hopped on for ~30 minutes for the first time in months a couple days ago. The map was absolutely dead as far as events go. I did a west tek run and hit local player vendors, still nothing.
---
I remembered how unrewarding it felt to play this game and hopped off. I love fallout and want to enjoy this game but the grind is just atrocious. Ironically adding NPCs seems to have made the game feel less alive than before.
---
Unlikely, but I wouldn't pay to much for one just in case

Argh - $30 for a package...too rich for my blood. Hopefully they'll do a similar backpack at some point, or better yet a good police backpack. Need one for my Officer Friendly character.
---
They couldn't do this unless they fix the auto complete bug. Imagine the whole week's worth of challenges auto completing!
---
I feel like a lot of people don't do it for kindness, just to get rid of duplicate plans since they stack up a lot.

If you're on xbox I have hundreds of plans that you can have.

It's a bug XD
---
Beyond anything; the brotherhood are a military; a military with no supply lines left and no specialists or infrastructure for providing non-military essentials.
---
They didn't recruit farmers because they were soldiers and soldiers belong in a warzone, not farmers. That was one of the biggest beefs between them and everyone else, military vs civilian. There was no government to mediate between the military and civilian logistics, so the brotherhood "requisition" supplies in the only way they have, demanding.
---
Sure they could have "bartered for supplies", but that means taking soldiers out of the field to scrounge for scraps, supplies being tied up in negotiations, and dedicated manpower and specialists being spread thin in endeavors no pertinent to the operational goal.
---
Was the way they handled it the best way? Not by a long shot. But it was a military way of handling it.
---
I found a [beautiful location](https://i.imgur.com/U0cSZpA.png) east of Point Pleasant on the top of a hill near a giant billboard.  There's a pond with a dock and canoe. It even came with an outhouse. I purposely sell stuff cheap because I want people to check it out.
---
Literally the reason why I stopped playing.

I use both. Instigating Gauss shotgun for trash enemies and to one shot the glowing ones with VATS in Radiation Rumble. Bloodied Gauss Minigun for when everything nearby absolutely needs to die right now.

From... vault 94 npc's after you finish the wastelanders quest line (raiding vault 94)
---
I wouldn't mind it so much if they actually said more than a couple things.
---
If you’re talking about it only saying “crafting unlocked: “ then that’s just because that’s a glitch. You didn’t actually learn anything. Just like the super duper sound happening when crafting a legendary item and not actually making a duplicate. Anytime you actually unlocked a mod plan from scrapping, it will tell you what you learned in the top left corner, as other people here have said.

I doubt the brotherhood is interested in the treasure. They probably have their own goals.
---
Agreed, +1 strength for each egg consumed.

If I had time to run more than one character, I wouldn't know what to do with myself :)

Why is it unlikely though? This bug is insane. It's like Moonkin from WoW killing new raid bosses in seconds, that wouldn't last more than 1 hour before a hotfix.
---
I prefer magic guns over duped, glitched, legacy ones.
---
This is what I don’t get about the complaints. I’m not going to get all the rewards, I might get 2/3 by the end of the season. And I’m totally fine with that. 
---
For me it means if I just play for an hour or so and don’t finish any quests there’s still smaller activities which will pay off with a little reward.
---
That's good
---
Unfortunately it's one number short, therefore I was unable to make the call.
---
Checking CLAIM TICKET
---
Well duh. They do several times the dps and are even more broken.
---
While you are correct this isn't your typical MORPG.  99.9% of the content is casual and the end-game bosses are a breeze even without magic weapons.
---
On top of that, there are no scoreboards or rankings or anything.  It's not like people are speed-running the latest raid getting to a worlds first using this stuff because we don't even have content like that so they are in no rush to fix it.
---
We should be able to start every public event whenever we want.
---
Public server after about 7 hours online
---
Mostly its for the scrip. Thats why people scavenge camps. Caps are largely meaningless beyond a certain point. Cheap 3\* scrip weapons are always going to be sought after items.
---
I meant people using them.
---
There's your problem. 
---
The ini file goes in drive:\Users/username\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76
---
People don't seem to realize that the atom store isn't free for a reason. When someone purchases something, they're actively paying for the continued development and content drip of the game. It's not meant to be free and the old method of dispensing atoms through challenges was far, far too generous.   
---
I get it, it sucks if you don't have the disposable income to buy atoms, but I'm afraid that's how it works and frankly how it should work. You don't need the junk on the atom store, it's there for the people that can afford to support the game.
---
In ESO there's an item you can unlock for your house that's just a huge pile of treasure, it just sits on the floor and glitters with all the gold and gems etc.  Would definitely be good to get something like that for F76.
---
I use both. The shotgun is way more ammo efficient.
---
sorry but just to confirm, when you say the ini file youre talking about the  fallout76custom?

Consider how long it’s taken them to fix other bugs, not to mention there are a lot of things that have been around since release. They promised explosive energy weapons would get a reimplementation, haven’t heard a peep since they disabled the drops.
---
My girlfriend and I built right across the creek from eachother south of the junkyard workshop. Up on the hill there is a nice little flat spot, and another fairly flat spot right at the bend in the creek. I even built us a nice little bridge so we can easily walk between our bases. It's a perfect spot.
---
More outfits, less skins, definitely.   
---
Though that's a big ask to be honest, you can tell the recurring ghille skins are down to a lack of time and resources devoted to the run.
---
Emphaty for someone taking my money and not giving me chance to see my investiment workout? no thanks. Game-Killing bugs are everywhere but too many parts of this game are broken. That's a AAA game, shouldn't be the way it is.
---
I disagree on 4; if you didnt have the *minutemen*, the other factions could have actually been characters instead of "alternatives if you dont want to be the goodest boi"
---
The minutemen were noblebright and annoying AF, and their existence necessitated the gutting of nuance from every other faction in that game.
---
Why don't you just level up and play a little longer and keep working towards the level up for the next day?
---
I mean the hacking/picking this is nice but mostly just quality of life. Yes extra special/perk cards are nice but again it's just extra pseudo levels that give regular perks. Not really legendary in my opinion but that's not really my point.
---
The main point is that you're realistically expecting 2 maxed perk cards. You're forced to chose between damage or utility.
---
What if it were the same for regular perks? Do you take nerd rage or 3 hacker? Do you have room in your build for chemist? Green thumb? Super super? We shouldn't be forced to chose between essential and utility.
---
Lastly, what if you make a mistake or want to change your build? You're locked into your choices, forever.
---
Like others said, it's just a visual glitch. I was trying to give away items through the trade screen and it said I had over 200,000 super stimpacks. Obviously, I didnt.
---
yes
---
I think you're trying too hard. Hens.
---
What IS a building team? Is it a workshop where you construct defenses?
---
That's definitely something I wanna see!
---
Wow, like a true Wastelander! lol, jk.
---
What platform are you on? I'm only in my early 100s fopr level, but if you catch me on PC, I'll help if I can. Lamorak\_2000
---
I didn't set up any machines or refineries, and the server has five people in it by the time I claimed the last one
---
I don't think this is correct. It was tested months ago and the findings were that it wasn't processing.
---
I didn't read any of the recent patch notes saying it was.
---
I get more quality and one hit kills ADS than I do with a crouched vats lock.
---
But even casual games like GW2 or Anthem hotfix things like this in a day or 2.
---
&gt;I prefer glitched weapons over glitched weapons
---
big brain energy my man
---
I'll never be able to finish the season. With only about 3 hrs / 4or maybe 5 days a week I just dont have enough time.
---
Glitched as in the mini nuke miniguns.
---
That high lvl player feeling get replace by being well equipped.
---
The same thing happened in elder scrolls online and at first people were concern etc etc but now everyone wouldn’t have it any other way
---
I’d just like the unlock text to be more descriptive. Scrapping a leather armor leg might unlock Studded for your chest, I’ve had to keep a spreadsheet just to keep track of what I already have to determine a lot of my shared mods.
---
Quality PSA right there ... have an up vote :)
---
Should be a commie cage.
---
Source? I deal the same damage in vats than aiming down sights, has to be something completely different
---
So no balance patch ? Yikes.
---
[Miguel aggressively playing banjo]
---
Thankfully that one has nothing to kill, and it wasn't out of the way of my route
---
No nobody is alone in fo76 disappointment lol
---
It'd be given to you by a Col. Gutsy named "Sanders".
---
I could easily be wrong but it's probably done with a lot of percentages.
---
Your weapon damage is converted into a percentage of the enemy HP. His attacks don't do 50hp +/- modifiers per swing, they do 10% +/- modifiers per swing. So you take the same percentage of damage as a low level character - easiest way to do simple scaling to level I would think.
---
This sub.
---
This is the 1st thread I read that says it is working.
---
Crossout does this. I stopped playing for a month. All of my weeklies back logged. I could go play the game for the rest of today and finish off the season in it’s entirety just from the weeklies I never did. I love the leniency it gives
---
I was just thinking to myself that I refrain from using bugged tactics because "they're not really intended" and "will eventually be patched", but I came to realize that's not really the case, is it?
---
basic db entries remain broken since the beta. since Fo4, actually. things that modders have fixed years ago, literally. bugs in this game aren't bugs, they're features.
---
unless it's related to the atom store or directly affects their revenue model, you can be sure it's gonna take them months, **years** to fix. if you do make a build around magic weapons, or any other bugged mechanic, by the time they fix it, I'd wager you'll have long grow bored of Fo76 and moved on to another game.
---
Do people have to show up at the location for the event to activate?
---
That’s a problem that has a lot of issues on both the player side and the development side.  Yes, they complain about swapping, but they are only swapping to min/max their damage and their rewards.  Just like players all try to take a legendary so everyone gets a drop, rather than the standard you see in other games where not everyone gets a drop from a creature.  I do it too, I just don’t complain (as much) since I realize I’m probably not playing as expected by the devs.  Of course if we had instances where we couldn’t’ swap cards so freely, people would have to stick to a build.
---
Of course with legendary perks, and eventually Load outs, that ship has long past sailed.
---
If you're playing on PS4, just listen to a Spotify playlist. I have one that's about 300 songs long and it's perfect. I never listen to the radio anymore and the music doesn't stop when I listen to trackers and holotapes.
---
All your character would know about the BOS is that they’re the knight like military order that died out trying to protect Appalachia from the scorchbeasts
---
Impressive!
---
Yeah but don't those games have end-game progression content?  Like difficult dungeons and trials for groups?  This game doesn't even have that.  My whole point is that there isn't any reason for them to rush to remove the magic effects because the content was trivialized long before their existence anyways with how powerful our characters can become without magic stuff and how easy the content itself is.
---
It does show (almost all) the rewards. There are about 4 or 5 blank reward boxes to the right of the black power armor. Then it starts showing the game board, planetarium, etc
---
I guess you could also do this on PC by pulling it up in the back ground. Not sure about Xbox.
---
I like to hit the 3 dailies at Camden park if I’m short on time, and foundation’s daily because I have the glitch where the item Ward wants is always in my inventory. I also try to swing by Huntersville because a legendary or two spawn there a lot of times, it may require some server hops though.
---
The absolute max is 2k (ignoring your actual max) but if you want high capacity I recommend weight reduction perks and weapon weight reduction armor.
---
those are actually hacked. it's a completely different thing.
---
I stand corrected.
---
Could you please list some of those downsides? I'm failing to see them myself.
---
This is why I have not picked a card in the last 50 levels or opened the 10 card packs I have saved.  I will dump all of them when the new system comes out.
---
I actually managed to do that. I don't know how I was able to but it worked. I just fiddled with it for about 10 minutes and got it to place.
---
Its not the same though
---
True I guess I rather them make end game first.
---
That’s the price we pay for drumsticks and nuggets
---
if you can convince others who show up to join in on instruments at the Sons of Dane event, you can get a good killin' beat going
---
I would just rather get my ammo in a finished condition. I know how to get the materials - I am level 400+ - I just don't want to anymore. And it is a lot easier getting lead from silos weight rooms - if you have a tent.
---
Yea it was like Butthead saying ‘did I just score?’
---
Keep in mind this is assuming they can even fix it.  It is totally possible that they tried and the code is so spaghetti that they can't figure it out.   Who knows.
---
Its nice to know I am on par with a lot of others out there in the wastelands as I just hit level 377 with almost 1300 hours.
---
Quite unofficial. Method available on Youtube.
---
Go for the eyes Boo! Go for the eyes!
---
The Burrows has been my new favorite spot for a few weeks now.  It’s kind of an all purpose xp/loot/legendary bonanza.
---
Or, they could just improve some of the other, utterly useless mods like mutants, rather than fucking up one build that people actually enjoy in its current state.
---
Right now the only three good general (non-PA) build options are:
---
1) Low-Life (LL) Bloodied/Unyielding -- for very high damage, high convenience, high xp gain, high fragility, having to constantly manage rad intake. And being sharply restricted on special point distribution and perk layout due to the number of required perks to make the build functional
---
2) LL Junkies/unyielding -- for good damage, high convenience, high xp gain, high fragility, having to constantly manage rad intake. And being sharply restricted on special points distribution and perk layout due to the number of required perks to make the build functional.
---
3) Full life (FL) Junkies/Vanguard -- for good damage, no added convenience, normal xp gain, high durability, not having to care about rad intake or management. Total freedom of special point distribution and perk layouts.
---
Of all the possible legendary mods we get on weapons, only two are any good at all, the rest are trash. 
---
Mutant is probably the next best candidate for fixing. But 10% per mutation is obviously too much as most of us are radded to the gills and running around with 7-15 mutations. But drop the bonus to say 5% per mutation and all the sudden you have a viable alternative to junkies. And it needs some kind of drawback like the others. Maybe making you take more rad dmg per piece or something, for example.
---
You would imagine that they would have put too much work into wastelanders to just throw it away. On the other hand, Bethesda has done some wacky shit in the past.
---
At 75, it takes just under 3k score for the next level.
---
To that end, a double score weekend will likely get you a long way there, especially if you do not complete the weeklys until double score goes into effect.
---
Get on a full build team, use the lunchboxes.
---
I think you'll have to do the 10k xp one a few times, too.  This is easy enough if you can do the WS loop, especially while on a full team (220+ xp per ghoul)
---
That’s where I disagree, from a good game design. You SHOULD be forced.  You should not be able to do everything, especially in a multiplayer game.  Characters should be specializing, so that then players can rely on each other to fill the gaps. If you want to specialize in doing every lick of damage you could, you should not have the ability to make mounds of ammo for your character, you should have to rely on the those who specialized more in crafting and then you can buy the ammo you need off of them.  If you’re dead set on going solo, you should be forced to reach a balance with your character.  Player should be rewarded for playing as a team, even if its a silent public team.  
---
Maybe they can give us a way to reset a card and get a good chunk of the coins back for people who make mistakes, but the overall idea that characters move into specializations and have to decide on damage vs. utility isn’t a bad thing.
---
That is an AMAZING outfit
---
Daylies for Atoms, weekly for SCORE. Yea i can live with that.
---
Level 378...if it wasn’t for the Line in the Sand “exploit”, there’s no way I could level up 3 times a week with the limited amount of time I can play.
---
Correct, I should have said most players. I agree that there are downsides. The overall longevity and future developments would be affected if daily log in numbers dropped.
---
If you want to be tanky, there is a 3* effect that reduces damage while sprinting or standing still. Either of those will make you super tanky.
---
Perks include Nerd Rage, Dodgy, Serendipity, Ricochet, Blocker, Fireproof. Dodgy and Ricochet are good but "non-essential"
---
Additionally I recommend every non-melee mutation minus healing factor with starched genes, class freak, and strange in numbers.
---
Wouldn't happen. Just about every online game has adapted the daily challenges model and there are reasons why.
---
At half an hour per pop, it's not certain you'll be able to find the events you want, but uranium fever is my personal fave because mole miners drop tons of loot and there's always 3 legendaries, so keep an eye out for that one.
---
What’s your GT? I was recently forced to start over, so we can play together.
---
Gotta catchem all! Pro-tect-tron!
---
And then he scrapped it
---
Mmmm...green stuff...
---
Yeah, it's unfortunate. Run has about 10% of the content you could have had with the atoms, and you dont even get to pick what you wan't. it's shitty ghillie skins and space trash thats so far from the general aesthetic of the game i could not possibly care less.
---
Why wouldn’t you use your critical hits?
---
Karen reported someone for a visual bug.
---
Get a faster internet connection/ssd lol
---
unless you are like me and just want to move them, I price building plans at 1c, armor ones at 5 and weapons at 10.
---
I figure most high lvl have them already, so my market is low lvls without much  caps.
---
Generally, if you see my vendors, expect things to be priced to move...ie, very very underpriced.
---
If events are your thing, I'd suggest joining a public team of higher levels, and joining high level events, and just trying to make sure you get a tag on things while higher levels clear. I feel like doing the entire Wastelander story quests would be a good chunk of xp as well.
---
Fastest way to level, is having a lot of Intelligence perks (intelligence boosts xp), unyielding armor for even more boost, and public team to boost even further. Then just run around, killing mobs while you wait for events to spawn.
---
 Can also Claim workshops and do the defend events while you wait for other events to spawn. Gives good xp, good loot, and some plans for camp building if you are a new player.
---
I always carry two sets of power armor plus an extra chest piece. I the perk card to makes it all weigh less so I'm not too bugged about the weight.
---
Lots of higher level players are right around level 300.  I just got to where there isn't much to do but farm gear for my shop and help new players.
---
The double and triple xp weekends don't really mean much when I already have 100 some unused levels.
---
Walk
---
If it comes up, the event guided meditation is a good xp source and you may get some legendaries in the mass of max level ghouls. If you are alone, just hold the bridge meditation hub - the ghouls at the other side usually get stuck and won't attack. If you position yourself more in the center between bridge and side hub, it can get messy fast (ymmv)
---
Another good event to farm xp is Line in the sand, if you are able to tag (or take down) multiple enemies in a short time frame.
---
I play on xbox and I have had no issues with finding events. If anything its hard for me to clear the map of them before a new one comes.
---
I'm proud of you. You did good.
---
if you want you have an example right here
---

---
What is hilarious is that apparently they "fixed" that in patch 21.
---
Oh no, not random creatures, it’s random noobs that constantly kill my poor Brahmin.
---
There are 4 different max capacity values.
---
1. Max before you can no longer fast travel
---
2. max you can walk/run using AP
---
3. max you an carry before walk speed is reduced to a crawl. 
---
4. Max before you cannot pickup anything, and anything you drop is insta-destroyed. 
---
1-3 depends on strength, perks, armor, and temporary adds from food items.  
---
4 is a hard limit imposed by the game.
---
I mean, invisible CAMP objects would be an actual problem, with people bumping into them or you forgetting where you put them. It's not that comparable to allowing additional control over your character's appearance, something completely cosmetic with no effect on gameplay whatsoever.
---
Also, who says there would have to be a jet animation coming out of nowhere? Make that invisible too. Muffle the sound as well. I for one don't care in the least if someone looks like they're hovering like magic. We all know what's actually happening. 
---
Also, look at how armor and clothing works. You get the benefit of wearing the best armor you can find, which is often bulky and unsightly, and just as "magically" hide it under slimming clothing options. Why do they allow this? Because it's always good to give the player more control and choice over what their character looks like, especially in an online game. If I have a backpack and a jetpack, it's going to clip and look really bad depending on the skin. Letting us hide one, the other, or both would be great.
---
And finally, this is a series where cloaking tech exists. There is literally armor that makes you invisible already. So I don't get why there's pushback against something you aren't being forced to use and that is more lore friendly and has a more logical explanation than magic armor that's suddenly skin tight when clothing is worn over it.
---
Those are typical mmos that have a skeleton and a massive player base to up hold. Guilds, clans and other things exist and make up the end game grind in dungeons and guild pvp events with reasons to play. This is nothing like those. We don't even have a cross character bank or a auction house to sell things.
---
That’s correct. That’s the maximum *base* for any SPECIAL. Which can then be affected by things like gear, weapons, food, chems, etc.
---
So jealous! Congrats!
---
“It just works”
---
If you die and you have junk on you, and I’m around you’re going to lose out. You shouldn’t go somewhere you could die and carry junk.
---
or if you are past level 50 make the level up a "get x amount of xp" 
---
I am having to make a new character go to wayward level up and delete every second day
---
And you could be correct as I said I could be way off on this. But just saying...
---
You probably wont be getting one for any ammount of caps, probably will have to barter somehting insane for it.
---
Oh, in that case, yes. You are way off.
---
Isp has nothing to do with loading.
---
When you're on a "lost" server, it gets quite eerie being the only dot on the map.  
---
It takes me 5-10 minutes to realise there aren't any other camp markers, then there aren't any other dots.
---
Lmfao that is amazing!
---
I'am 100% certain they lowered the event spawns because of all the new grindy crap we have to do.  Events are good for two things now, decent xp and t-notes both of which are needed for the grind and since bethesda wants to turn this into a mobile format game they are gonna drag everything out for as long as possible :-(.  I love the fallout franchise and I've stuck with 76 from the start, but it's sadly becoming more of a chore then a game.     Just my 2 cents....
---
That explains why my omelette tasted funny.
---
Check the place better , if I remember well cores to destroy are divided on a few rooms maybe you missed some
---
I wholeheartedly agree with that with one exception added: Beth should keep *one* random daily quest for some who actually might want to log-in daily.
---
Honestly this, I'm going for 100 because I'm a completionist, I like to complete passes and max it out lol D2 got into it 
---
But really, if you want the reward at level 40 then go for it, if you don't want anything then thats fine!! I want the rewards at 100 so lol
---
Yep, I just jump around the map doing any event or helping defend a workshop, I have everything and maxed out all my gold and have 100's of script.  It will come to everyone in time, you just can't have it right now.  new content and grind will help, I am ready for it whenever it comes.
---
did you miss one (or more) of the consoles?
---
My only problem with these recon tools is that the markers disappear when you switch off the weapon. I love my Pearly Peepers though I would be heart broken if I lost mine, my condolences. 😞
---
Lol fellas I'm level 268, and I've run this thing like a hundred times. I'm tellin you, they're all gone. The progress bar just stopped progressing
---
Yeah, and that's kinda fair enough I suppose. I just have to accept the fact that I'm playing in a slightly different way to most people, and get on with it.
---
Kinda shows how little content is in the game that they gotta FORCE players to login instead of wanting to.
---
It's really spooky knowing that you're the only person alive; the only person left. You can do anything and no one would know. Also, it's the closest I'll ever be to being a Fo1st player lmao
---
This was an Epic Tale, but it makes me want to throw a bunch of legendary gear at you too.
---
[The bard has enter the battle]
---
*fighting banjo music intensifies*
---
Backpacks just look weird as hell on my ranger armour currently, especially because they don't have slings and just look super glued on or something lol. It'd be awesome to make them invisible.
---
Do the steel fact. Or in the sbq region. Do the sbq and when everybody is gone go back every 15 mins. When a SB spawns dont kill it but get al the scorched instead. I have over 2500 stable flux now ( fo1st) in my scrapbox.
---
To take from Crazy Rich Asians...
---
Bok-Bok, Bitch.   
---
\*shotgun blast\*
---
West Tek 100%. Fast and productive as far as loot, legendaries and exp. The burrows is ghouls its random loot and legendaries from ghouls 80% of the time is armor. Super mutants drop more legendary weapons and 5.56 ammo.
---
Outstanding work vault dweller. Now go enjoy your brand spanking new set of lvl 50 Ultracite Power Armor.
---
The thing is this game doesn't deserve the amount of grinding it takes. It literally limits grinding so much it can't even be called that and are instead just chores that you get zero reward for. A game that's not even cared about by its own developers should NOT be as grindy as this. The lack of shit the devs give combined with heavily dropping player number shows this.
---
I hit level 81 yesterday in the seasonal challenge without paying attention to dailies or weekly's.  Just play the game and it will come to you.  If you don't make it to the end you won't be the only one.  I am sure the rewards will be for sale at some point.
---
And it would now make sense for her to send us off on a mission to kill a raider that she found out about through radio chatter.
---
It was just what i expected. I think you still have too high expectations.
---
What are the reasons why?
---
Trying to collect vox data?
---
I would have liked to have seen more balance there, too.    In a perfect world, the Minutemen could have occupied the role that the BOS did, while giving the other factions more room to exist.
---
What i don't understand are people who say rewards are only for people who play every day. If someone plays 12 hours over saturday and sunday, how is that less hardcore than someone who plays one hour a day, every day? 
---
Everyone is playing the game to have fun. I don't see why some content should be denied to players who can only get on certain days of the week. I can get on almost every day of the week, but i know people who work weekends and thus miss out on the double score, extra experience and other events. People have complicated lives and different responsibilities.
---
 Not everyone is able to play on a daily schedule, that doesn't mean they should miss out on content they are paying for.
---
Yep
---
I would hope so, but if this "pro mode" is a paid option it will probably be included or inclusive in Fallout 1st memberships. With Bethesda's track record, "Not way off"
---
Angryturtle did a no legendary/no mutation playthrough and was able to solo the SBQ.. So it's doable. Personally I like to walk over FT myself when I'm not just doing a quick log in/logout to get my daily allotments... It definitely adds time to the playthrough, but you save a lot of caps that's for sure. The only thing you'll really be suffering on is missing out on the minor events unless you're close by.
---
*all of the above*, probably. I like to hoard resources and farm exp and do events and if someone shoots a nuke I’ll be there. Lots to do.
---
Looking at Bethesda's track record of how they fix and balance stuff -- high chance the shotties will end up being useless after the fix, at least for a year.
---
The 1st one
---
Zero caps, there's one you can get at the top of West Tek. You can server hop there and get hundreds of pies for free.
---
Isp?
---
That's really kind, but I'm just trying to figure out how to make some better armour. It's not clear yet what sort of plans can be found in which quests or events.
---
Gjallahorn anyone?
---
Thank you. One of my favs at the moment. The other i wear is the Responders paramedic overall. My friend has the bloody butcher apron. We play together as 'You Kill them I grill them '
---
I have had this happen before as well.  It was right after the patch where you could no longer destroy them with an explosive weapon.  I had read about it so the first silo I did after hearing about it I tried my explosive shotgun and nope, couldn't destroy them.  I then proceeded to pull them all manually and it never let the grid drop.  As far a I can figure out shooting them first caused the issue but I'm not entirely sure if it was that or just a random bug.
---
Have never had it happen again but I make sure to not shoot them now.  It's frustrating to waste time and ammo and then not be able to progress.
---
... I beg your pardon?
---
They just wanna keep their player base up.
---
The silo was probably lagging out
---
...and then you don't know which one is the right one to take so you decide out of panic knowing full well where you wanted to go but you didn't want to cross the busy road and end up being taken far away from your destination to find yourself halfway across the nation with nothing but a handful of pennies and a few pistachio nut shells in your pocket to barter your way back to your home ಥ\_ಥ
---
Just hope that when you hop servers you don’t get a yao guai...That thing is hard to get data from do. You can shoot it and try to hop on a bus if you try to tag the one by the cemetery
---
If you play XB1 I wouldn't mind helping you out a little. I was essentially in the same boat till a couple months ago. Made gains since then, but I wouldn't mind throwing some simple gear your way and giving you some pointers on building your character stronger.
---
Fridges exist.  There was a massive uproar when they were released.
---
There's actually quite a bit to discover just walking around the map. Backpacking so to speak.
---
"way off" was your own assessment lol I was simply agreeing with it, but keep downvoting me ya sadsack
---
Internet service provider
---
Most people I know have stopped playing because it became a chore instead of a game. Not sure how it's helping keep the player base up
---
Im sure this just made the top priority on the next patch lol Nice find.
---
very true. how about a weekly challenge of "Play for XX Mins a Day - 0/7"?
---
Here is the proof. Just tested it with a level 15 handmade I just crafted.
---
\- Sneak attack: [https://imgur.com/0Fy8kp6](https://imgur.com/0Fy8kp6)
---
\- Vats sneak attack (note that the sneak attack multiplier message didn't pop up, but I dealt the exact same amount of damage than without vats): [https://imgur.com/ZYqGzCP](https://imgur.com/ZYqGzCP)
---
\- Non sneak attack: [https://imgur.com/FEIpOXF](https://imgur.com/FEIpOXF)
---
Same gun, same enemy, same distance, same everything. If what you said was true, that supermutant should have the same amount of health left in the 2nd and last screenshot.
---
So yeah, I'm still 100% convinced that is just a display bug and you are talking about a completely different bug. I don't care who or how many people said it was broken, only took me 5 minutes to see that vats sneak attacks ARE working.
---
Horde legendary farm, don't kill the alpha, always spawn legendarys
---
Possum, beaver, and fox seem to be the easiest for me. Molerats and radrats We’re pretty simple as well. They will aggro Start attacking you. Just keep healing.
---
A friend of mine was asking about this earlier so I have a quick spreadsheet made so I can sum up XP requires to hit certain levels.  Lets use you as an example.  I am going to assume OP's math is correct for the level requires to max your cards with only 2 coins per card.  
---
To max all your cards, you will need to do your 1-471 trip 2.7 more times over to reach the required Level 782.
---
They are 10 and drop 5-10
---
I'm solo a lot so I tend to stealth through rather than get embroiled in a fight that my poor little melee only might not survive. If you're on xbox I'd gladly buy some of that flux... I'd like a jet pack for my X-01. 🤗
---
Ah! Thanks
---
The dailies take maybe 30 minutes tops most days. Why are people having so much trouble with it? 45 yesterday due to NW daily. Shortest dailies of any MMO I’ve ever played.
---
That definitely looks like a visual bug
---
How, though? If the weekly log in numbers stayed the same, then surely the daily log ins wouldn't matter one bit. Why would they? 
---
Nothing really happens on a daily basis, that would affect the profitability of the game, which in turn is what affects the investment in the game's future. The 1st subscriptions are per month, the Atomic Shop inventory changes every week. The only thing that I can personally think of, that might change per day, are some Atomic Shop discounts, but if those are in any way a significant thing, then surely the discounts could be moved to a weekly basis as well.
---
Daily chores are a very, very efficient way of burning out your playerbase. We will keep doing the chores as long as we can, and then at some point we just can't, because all it will have become is logging in to do the daily challenges so we don't miss out on S.C.O.R.E., and once those are done, we leave the game.
---
For my part, for what it's worth, I'm honestly personally not sure if I can keep doing this for the next season, if nothing changes, which means that while I may pay for Fallout 1st, I'll probably stop spending money to buy those 4000+1000 Atom bundles. Then I'll probably become pretty bitter about the fact that I miss out on all the cosmetics in the season, which will probably then make me want to log in even less, until at some point, while I'll definitely keep logging in every now and then, I'll stop paying for 1st as well.
---
So as far as future development goes, my own personal, anecdotal account of the situation is that "forcing" me to log in every single damn day, because there's the fear I won't have enough S.C.O.R.E. if I keep taking days off since the math isn't absolutely evident and clear, will lead me to stop spending money on the game.
---
That's what World of Warcraft did to me, so I've got over a decade of evidence to back that up, as far as I'm personally concerned. I can't, obviously, speak for anyone else.
---
But yeah, I just can't see why *daily* login numbers would matter, at all. If anything, I'd think they look at monthly numbers.
---
Yesterday, someone started up Encryptid just as a nuke was landing on Fissure Prime. C'mon!
---
That's real kind, but I'm on PC.
---
I feel like it's different for each server, but certainly that couldn't be possible! /s
---
I like that she tells me "You know the drill" when I pick up her quest. No fuss, no bluster, just 'here, go and get the things.'
---
Whenever I get squirrels I just go kill them and make tasty squirrel stew and server hop.
---
Apparently it's fixed (I think?) Sure I read that in a note somewhere in the last week or two. I haven't seen it since whenever I read that. Although I *have* kept up my routine of always logging in to adventure first, always doing the NW challenge last, etc., so maybe I am misrecalling.
---
I've done over 3000 hours &amp; 3 characters between level 130 &amp; 486 keeps me busy
---
I hate myself for it but I can't shake the fact that all I can see when I look at the ghillie suit is Old Gregg.
---
I’m much more a journey than destination gamer. In numerous other games I’ve deleted max level characters (multiple times) just to remake the same style character, so time isn’t an issue.
---
This is incorrect - you don’t drop your fluxes. They totally disappear from your inventory.
---
The hit box on the ash piles isn't correct, it can block regular goo piles from being lootable.  I think the goo piles are worse, but they're both bugged currently.
---
Not an issue if you don't loot the bodies, but there are a lot of people who try to clean up there and pick up ammo, weapons to scrap for steel, pleasant valley claim tickets, etc.
---
I'm wearing the Black Prospector's Hat, the Quack outfit, and the Plague Doctor's mask. All I need is a cane or something to finish the look.
---
Hey if your on PC and want someone to team up with let me know. I've been playing since B.E.T.A. and I'd be happy to show you around and was to get better gear and whatnot.
---
Nothing in particular, really.  I'll run silos and launch nukes, and in between, check player vendors hoping to find the one or two bits of armor I'm missing.  Some days I build a new CAMP.  Other days I might try to grind some Caps if those are low.
---
I'd definitely say that the time is right for another kind of endgame event like A Colossal Problem, though.  There really isn't enough interesting content to test my mettle.
---
Oh. Well at least I know I didn’t scrap it now but I coulda dropped it. I’ll hav to look sometime
---
Yes, and this brings out the griefers because they are bored.
---
&gt; I am extremely disappointed that the best way to level up in the game is running one location over and over and over.
---
hahahah
---
It always felt weird that when it splinters into the Wolf Horde event after, it’s the only horde which doesn’t have a legendary. Like they somehow mixed up which quest was supposed to have the legendary leader in it
---
Quite frankly the only things that get fixed are the ones that keep showing up on the internet showing our ability to be innovative.
---
It's a nice relaxing game to just farm up materials, and legendary items. It's not for everyone, I feel this is a game you either love, or hate, there's no in between.
---
Me and a group of friends just join a server, launch 3 nukes on SBQ, do the Encrypted Event, then move to another server, launch 3 nukes, do Encrypted, move to another, and so on. When dailies reset, we do all those. Then keep nuking. If I'm playing solo, I just run around, killing and looting everything, scrapping everything for materials. 
---
All this in about 2-3 hours per night during the week, but I tend to spend a lot of time on the weekend. I also am constantly editing my camp, I really enjoy the camp building in this game.
---
I used to enjoy trading on the Fo76 Discord (this is how i met most my friends), making spreadsheets and tracking everything, but because of so many cheaters and dupers, everyone has everything. Everyone is trying to trade full sets of Marine Armor with U-Sent-AP Refresh, or B-E-90%RW Legacy weapons, trading is just not fun anymore.
---
I’m gonna have to buckle down in Nuclear Winter so I can unlock the Vault-Tex mini gun paint, about 20 levels out.
---
Wow 1000 IQ here 😆, and you need air to breathe
---
Fast travel: I highly doubt you'd enjoy doing none at all unless it's purelly an rp run. The only free spot is 76 unless you're in a party and you can just party/server hop to suit your needs.
---
. What’s the punch bowl do? Just has drinks in it right or do you get a special effect.
---
This is the only reason I have a high intelligence character
---
I did bru 🤟
---
I just didnt realize anything like 60 was possible. I figured best you'd be able to get would be 20 or so with various +1 armors or food buffs etc. 
---
That's amazing!
---
How much of a hassle is it to do dailies? It takes like 30 minutes at most
---
Ok. That’s what I thought. Might hav to check one out when I’m a little higher level and gear
---
I'm hella impressed you did it on a public server, too! I've always wondered what it would be like to claim them all.
---
Oh. Then ya I wouldn’t repair cause that would b pretty annoying
---
After finishing every daily this season, I'm burned out trying to keep up. Logging in daily just isn't worth the pay-off.
---
I'm honestly surprised you're lvl 268 and still run silo the legit way :D
---
My empire was glorious! Muahahahahahahahaahhahaaa!!!!
---
I’m not necessarily playing when I’m online.  Sometimes I’m just sitting at my camp with “Happy Camper” on hoping people stop buy for my vendor.
---
Yeah that’s about what I dropped them down to
---
Yeah, it works out if you’ve only done one build. But I’ve respecced my level 412 main about 7 times now, and will likely never have all legendary perks maxed out.
---
\[Perks\]
---
Mandatory: Nerd Rage, Serendipity, Starched Genes, Class Freak (pls dont be that guy not using Adrenal Reaction and Marsupial in your bloodied stealth build. Everyone will lol at you.), Stealth\*\*, Covert Operative, Elusive
---
Optional but highly recommended: Flammable ^((consider mandatory for fighting scorchbeasts)), Lead Belly, Ricochet, Luck of the Draw ^((If commando - will significantly prolong weapon use between repairs))
---
^(\*\*Once you have 26-28+ agility from your 5/5 unyielding you can start dropping stealth cards to free up points. Your agi will be so high that your stealth will be incredibly strong even without the perk.)
---
\[Gear\] 
---
Weapon: Bloodied ideally, Junkies is very solid, but not quite as strong
---
Armor: Unyielding set. Period. No alternatives. Bolstering can substitute empty unyielding slots temporarily, but 5/5 unyielding should be your goal asap. Unyileding boosts youe vats efficiency , your xp gain, your ap gen, and most importantly, your stealth. AGI is king and unyielding gives you a lot of it.
---
Underarmor: I use reader underarmor for +int and +per.
---
Outfit: If youre a min maxer you want a tattered dress for +1 perception. But its a tiny tiny increase relative to the mountains of stats youll get from your unyielding set.
---
I get online and the next thing I know, five hours have gone by. Honestly couldn't even account for what I do in that time. Events, a couple dailies, player vendor hopping, fartin around my camp making adjustments here and there...🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Ok. How often do you get the notes from an event or is it garunteed?
---
I am going to add some quick math just to help people put this in perspective depending on their point in the game.  
---
* If you are Level 50, you would need to do that trip **237** more times to get to Level 782. 
---
* If you are Level 100, you would need do that time **59** times. 
---
* If you are Level 150, **26** times. 
---
* Level 200, **14** times.
---
* Level 300, **5.7** times
---
* Level 400, **2.8** times.  
---
* Level 500, **1.4** times.  
---
So find what level you are close to and think how long it took you to get there.  That is how long it would take you to max all your cards.  
---
I took a fairly long break so my numbers may be bad.  My friend took less of one, and he is in the 300's.  By this math, it would take him 5 more years to max his cards.  That is some EA levels of "feelings of satisfaction"
---
The SCORE challenge replaced the daily challenge that gives atoms. Instead, it gives rewards, but you don't get to pick them. The ones near the end are power armor skins, which are some of the most expensive plans, atom-wise. So by not completing it, you miss out on the equivalent value of the end loaded prizes 
---
So while no one NEEDS them, you're losing a lot of value from what you used to be able to get.
---
I have seen a few legendary raider hunters, and crazy legendary wildlife spawns.  Fight a SBQ for 20 minutes and get a * bottle opener.....  kill a legendary frog and get a ***binford 9000 ???
---
How much space do friendly animals take up, in your camp quota?
---
I'm thinking if you can cruise control for a few days without logging in you will miss atom shop freebies or sales and then Bethesda will get angry emails about missed windows. 
---
If I only knew that paint was on sale..........
---
But yeah, they want you logged in everyday to keep you engaged.
---
Save the World in Fortnite does the same thing with dailies. Difference is you can keep grinding even when dailies are done as they always have a plethora of rewards. Even the repeatable quests are better than ours.
---
I’m in the same boat. I would have been happy if it also produced chicken meat every so often, but I‘ll take the fertilizer.
---
You are not the only one, a friend I usually play with has the same problem on PC. Unfortunatley it is his main and only character, a 2nd one he made to test did not have this problem.
---
Same. I built an alt for leveling faster.
---
That's amazing! This would be a great solution.
---
I fast travel, it can take longer than walking across the map.
---
I literally had 7 to 10 people just go to town it was amazing
---
Imagine thinking anything about the "Legendary" run is hardcore.
---
Did you try to fast travel out and run it again to see if it fixed itself?
---
nice, thank you for taking the time, seems my thread was quite successful, will save your build and after 20 more levels i will switch :-).
---
Anyways, i learned alot, especially that you can crit with space bar\^\^, noone ever explained that to me and i thought that critting was chance based and auto applying
---
Ok.
---
Because they are uninspired and BORING.
---
People who log in daily should get some reward on top. But I agree that the focus should be on weekly rewards. Maybe keep the current daily challenges, but double or tripple the amount of weekly ones.
---
I think it depends. Fomo is a real thing and follows the same logic that gets people to enjoy gambling, despite it usually taking mire than it gives. The issue becomes for casual players, that do deal with it, that they have to continue playing or cut it out entirely. There’s not a lot of compromise and it’s a lot more challenging for them than “just don’t worry about it.” That’s bad for BGS and the playerbase, especially when almost every game has a season pass sort of system.
---
If Bethesda was willing to make them all available through atom purchases at least I think it’d be less addicting than if someone misses out and will never see those objects again. But personally I think there is a better approach to this same idea that doesn’t aid addictive behavior or lower Bethesda’s earnings.
---
Reward for that quest is a set of ultracite power armor if I remember correctly. Full set including chassis. Enjoy.
---
True. I’m not an outwardly RPer, but I always have story in my head that I try to stick to. That’s why I’m leaning to free and train stations (I wish they had something in game to justify it like stables or such in other games). I can fit train stations in picturing a hand rail cart or such since no functioning trains since most tracks are intact.
---
It will definitely make those go and fetch quests a lot more annoying.
---
Didn’t say it worked lol
---
Yeah I definitely agree not to take their stuff as that would be pretty annoying for them. I can see why some players would tho
---
I haven't read up on any info that might exist so I could be wrong, but I always thought it would be like Wastelanders to the vanilla story. Set sometime after the vault raid was over and the new folks settled in.
---
It might come with some timeline inconsistencies or locking you out of completing something "in time" (like Reclamation Day) but I don't expect it to replace it.
---
Understandable.
---
Exactly. I can’t remember exactly how you get it, but when the reward pops for ending that quest, I think It goes in your inventory. Check it out.
---
I’m doing quests, events, messing with my camp, looting/collecting materials, taking photos (I love the photography aspect of the game!) and most importantly, chatting with my friends who are also playing! I’ve made a great group of friends through this game who are like a second family to me, and we play together almost daily. So we are usually talking/helping each other out. :)
---
If it's your cup of tea heck yeah, I wasn't too into anything but demo derby. Oh and moonshine but you really won't find any of that unless you have a white trash cousin in the area
---
"Only a fucking coward hides!"
---
I don't think the complaints are "I don't play enough to get all the rewards". 
---
They are "I play the same amount of time as someone else, but because they play every day and I play at the weekend, they get all the rewards and I don't".
---
A more flexible battlepass structure is a good thing.
---
The only levels I bought were the ones that rewarded the 150 Atoms that cost the 150 Atoms, and I'm sitting on the last space right now trying to fill it up and be done with this damn thing.
---
Depends on how you enjoy it playing. If you’re the stealthy type then working through the Settler mission arc to obtain the Chinese stealth suit is a really solid investment: it’s an all-in-one hazmat suit, stealth boy and light armour piece. If you’re looking for better protection then buying the Secret Service armour plans are your best bet since it outclassed every other armour set in every way by quite a degree. 
---
If you’re PS4 I’d be happy to gift you some legendary armour and weapons to make the wasteland a little less...trying.
---
It's certainly doable. Especially the Armor and Weapons. Since you aren't limiting to no legendaries, that part shouldn't pose much of a problem. 
---
The no FT is a bit rough, but if you strategically place your camp, and 1st camp if you have it, this can also be mitigated a small amount. I'd place them close to the raider and/or settlers base camps so that you can FT back to them while doing the main quest. Plus it gives you a central FT point in the Forest with V76 and a northern and southern FT spot.
---
Mutations are not really needed imo, so I don't think you miss out on much there. They are useful, and can provide a lot of damage, but you can easily do without them.
---
After finally being over legendary run I am back having fun in the game. Relocated my 3 alts camps too. Last night was the last camp, spent like 6 hours moving into the very same place due to bugs. Only nukes would make me take a break.
---
Yep. Actually hit the 2k mark after a very productive line in the sand where people didn’t use auto grenade launchers to scatter the loot into the wind. First time I have had to drop just just to get myself up to waddle speed.
---
Why is he being downvoted? He’s not wrong. If everyone turned it off it would deposit everyone as a solo player. The issue is literally almost every player would have to because anyone that didn’t will still be placed with a team into the match. So if literally everyone who played it turned team full to off, the end result would be the same. I get you don’t like that answer, but I doubt Bethesda’s will be any better
---
Oh shit. That'll help!
---
Sounds like a freaking victory to me! That'll show him for sure! I lol'd, thank you!
---
No real build in mind yet. I have a base concept that doesn’t factor in weapon selection until near or  at 50, so I’ll have plenty of things to pick up on the way and still have enough left over to nail down his combat style. Will end up, at least part time, in PA since no Vault-Tex hazmat suits exist.
---
Mine are a few seconds but I am considering buying a ssd just for this game.
---
Sometimes when I am 'online', I am not actively playing. I might be afking in NW while I am doing paperwork or doing chores.
---
That’s smart. Making water and selling it to buy other stuff. Thanks to me being level 15 I’m in a low level area so my plans do sell somewhat. As someone coming along and taking water I can see why you’d like it for water to be unlocked but I can see why owners lock them.
---
Rocket league does something similar where weekly challenges are available for the entire season. New ones come every week, but they carry over until the end. It’s great for the rocket pass. I would like to see Bethesda do something similar!
---
Much appreciated
---
Thanks for the link.
---
I added you.
---
Good point!
---
I’ve never gotten it to 60, but I do have an alt that runs around with a base 15 Int, five Unyielding pieces with +Int (+20) and Mutations that grant another +7, for a total of 42. 
---
I’m sure I could get the other 18 and up to 60 fairly easily. Berry Mentats for another +5, Brain Bombs for another +3/6, Steeped Aster Tea for +2. I’m sure I’m missing something else.
---
Thanks for the clues, that's great help.
---
Really. Stuff doesn’t drop during events? That’s nice. So the fluxes go straight to ur inventory after she’s killed?
---
he was only partially correct, this game and older Elder scrolls+fallout games load cells rather than the whole world so when a player walks into a cell its contents are loaded so loot, buildings, npc's, etc get processed though not all rendered at once due to how direct vision culling works so if you cant SEE something on the otherside of a mountain it would visially render to save processing the extra object (if you'v ever spawned inside a rock or wall you'll likely seen the invisible world once, this is related to that)
---
so if camps were close together anyways those players have already loaded those cells regardless so your actually getting the data for said cells loaded up per client even when you yourself are not there because the cell itself is loaded.
---
thats why servers with most people all in one part of the map lag less than ones with everyone all over the place because less cells are running actively.
---
so tighter camps would actually encourage close proximity building and mean LESS cell loading
---
Because at its core, those are the people this game is designed for. There's no real end-game, there are various kinds of grinds that are *supposed to* last a long time before drying out completely. Dupers have greatly decreased the lifespan of those grinds, but the people who play are still able to make do with what's left. It's a sandboxy game like minecraft but with a fallout theme over it. In a way, you have to make your fun. And there are plenty of people who can spend all day making their own fun with the tools this game provides.
---
If you mean in terms of the demographic, from reading posts and replies here over nearly two years now, it seems many people playing this game are older and more or less set in their lives. More specifically, either retired or able to just come back from work and spend the rest of the day on playing
---
Based off the name ima make a guess as to what it does. Does it make you shine/glow after drinking it?
---
Yeah. Once you pass level 100 it requires alot of effort to completely level up in a day without the use of xp buffs like lunchboxes. I suppose I wouldn't mind if it was once every week but every day is a pain in my ass. Like the other challenges ( besides NW) are easy to get done. Maybe you might have trouble finding a legendary to kill but they tweaked it from 3 kills to 1.
---
Like I love the game but I dont want to have to play it everyday
---
Works great. Just remember to have at least 1 rank in fireproof and the dense chest plate mod. Also have a backup weapon that’s not explosive if you like to do SBQ.
---
Is there a workshop thats easier for lower levek players?
---
Thanks for all the nukes we appreciate it. I also like to play with camp building as well.. my camp is small but I like to fill it with all kinds of "organized clutter" to make it more visually appealing. Hard to do when you dont spend alot on the atom shop
---
Nah I’m on PS4 but thanks for offering
---
On a rainy day it’s fallout and afk for vending and keeping workshops for farming materials.
---
I’m cooking cleaning and taking out the trash and will rush back if someone launches a nuke.
---
Finishing that quest gains you access to the office behind a laser mesh - top floor fort defiance. Use the computer and you’ll learn how to make ultracite power armour. 
---
With a solid build you can get away with most top level basic armour/weapons until you find complimentary legendary or build a good power armour set. (Only just swapped to legendary melee weapon a few days ago on alt @ lvl 105)
---
https://nukesdragons.com/ is a good site to craft builds. But happy to answer any questions mate. You did bloody well
---
Yeah this is discouraging me from server hopping for it. I just make sure to buy some every time I visit a new server. But that means I'm usually at 800-900 scrip
---
No, it's moonshine but with quantum. Makes you run faster and do more damage for a while
---
Also it makes you black out drunk and it spawns you in a random part of the map. You could even get a skyrim easter egg
---
U on PS4? I wouldn’t b able to b on the mic tho. My mics not to great
---
Yeah, probably going limited in mutations. I can justify 3 to real world circumstances and the rest are just to wild to fit. FT not really an issue, I’m FO1st and enjoy walking
---
I use the new teams to see who is on the server.  If there are three or four teams I will launch a nuke or start imposter sheep event but you are right, there should be a better way to see who is on the server.
---
&gt; In what time frame? 
---
I don't know the correct answer for this since I am not big into game developing or the human psyche but I can be certain it isn't in the time that it takes to hit 782.  
---
Players tend not to have an approach of "Meh, I'll get to it when I get to it" unless they have a lot of content to consume in between.  That content in between gives the impression that the goal isn't 'for them' yet and takes away the pressure.  
---
With the position the game is in now where the majority of the player base are probably in 'end game' mode.  So a goal this far away will either be seen as impossible which makes the players unhappy or players will actively TRY for it and begin to burn out.  
---
Once something is in, it doesn't matter what Bethesda 'wanted' us to do with it.  If the majority of the player base treats it as something else, its that something else now.
---
Some of the serums require it.
---
Build a personal terminal at your camp. It will tell you exactly where they are.
---
Not sure. I still see people posting about it happening on here pretty regularly. It hasn't happened to me yet, but for everyone's sake I really hope it's fixed for season two.
---
There’s much fewer events now, so when one pops up people all rush to it. Horde events are great for xps, maybe Bethesda doesn’t want everyone to finish the legendary run too easily.
---
Nice. I know what I’ll b looking for today
---
Build the personal terminal.  If you don't have it then search the atom shop to unlock it for free.  There is an option in the terminal to mark the location on your map.
---
Oh lit, but is the terminal an atomic shop buy or how do I unlock it?
---
There have been many, many exploits to bypass budget/stash limits over time, and a few dupes put things directly into your stash which also bypassed the stash limit
---
Also thankyou so mich!
---
Go to any station and read the party poster. It will start a quest to learn how to make it. Those morgantown students sure knew how to party
---
That alternates between Retirement plan and Importance of communication, only the very first time do you get both.
---
Same. I made a new character just for completing the score system as easily as possible. I haven't had time to do the brotherhood, enclave, or free states questlines and the character is level 160. 
---
Unless the datamined Communist armor is in the next season, I doubt I will be trying to complete it.
---
I like the Poseidon power plant, the enemies are lower level and you can do the powering up Poseidon event to get xp/plans, and then use the power plant itself after powering up to collect fusion cores from the plant itself. You can then sell those in your vendor or use them for energy weapons.
---
Its free on the atomic shop.
---
Hasn’t really worked for me, a tedious and boring grind doing pointless chores with no new content has actually made me stop playing pretty much since week 1 of the season.
---
Paying atoms to get a legendary black cat at the atomic shop!
---
No, Xbox.
---
I didn't realize what I've been personally doing actually had a term for it.
---
The perk coin idea needs to taken out back and put down. 
---
It places a penalty on duplicate perk cards that get burned when opening perk packs as well as moving a SPECIAL point.
---
Unless they add the Nuclear Winter system where a burned one turns into a token automatically AND make it so that moving a SPECIAL point gives you a coin in place of the perk.
---
Even then legacy character will have lost coins who have already had burned cards and moved SPECIALS. 
---
It would be easier if they would decouple perk cards and coins. Every level you get X coins. Simple as that.
---
Also for the love of Todd, I know i have a perk pack and gained a billion levels. STOP blasting me with an intrusive UI EVERY. TIME. I OPEN THE MENU. Make it a visible icon that doesn't force me to click "no" to be able to regain control of the UI and mess with perks.
---
TLDR; Just make perk coins per level and decouple them from perk cards so there is no downside.
---
True, but less bothersome than rl and the ppl I’m forced to deal with at work. Gonna try a few ways to move faster. Wish there was a 10mm Vault-Tec skin, will have grab a laser pistol early and the Gun Runner perk.
---
Exactly. I even remove demo expert to drop the damage. Every mob gets tagged for 15-20 damage.
---
I guess as a side note to that, if they do add loads of content that you want to log in every day, you would be annoyed to spend all your time doing dailies instead of the actual content you wanna do
---
Well I already have an SSD &amp; 70 megabit internet so I don't think this problem is anything to do with client hardware. Plus if it were, it would be consistently slow loading after fast travel I think.
---
Right there with you. The season sounds great but as soon as people realise they can't get the reward they want because they can't play 2-3 hours every single day of the season they'll quit.
---
It is easier to manage inventory than to manage real life issues. Jokes aside, it is my hobby. 
---
It replaced watching films, painting miniatures, etc.
---
It could also be the appearance of the loot drop. I ran into the same problem that you are having alot when I was using the standard paper bag. However, ever since getting the bright blue free (non-canvas) bag, I have had alot more success. I just make sure to drop it in a clear area where it is not covered by plants and is clearly visible. Also, after waving and doing the gift emote, I take my gun and fire a single shot next to the bag then put away my gun so that I do not scare off the low level.
---
That would require Seasons to either have less tiers to compensate for the lack of dailies or grossly overvalue the weeklies to fill up 100 tiers.

I wanna say the same but I think I’ve missed 5 days since the season started and I was away for 2 of them.  I don’t think there’s anything particularly good besides the ammo converter that they screwed up, but I just wanna complete the board. I’m at 80 so once I finish I’m probably taking a break.
---
Shocker! Bethesda is fucking lazy man.
---
So true. You can play Fallout and make dinner, do dishes, etc.
---
I know fallout 4 had loading screen issues when V-sync was turned on, not sure if this could be the same thing.
---
I’ve missed a couple days and I’m still ahead
---
This is a very accurate statement.
---
The other day there were three us fighting the SBQ and one was a level 10.  I think I spent 5 stimpacks bringing this guy back, it was kind of funny because we gave up helping him and of course he respawned in the nuke zone just to die again.  The guy kept coming back and reaped the rewards at the end.
---
I wouldn't worry about it. I missed 2 days last week and I was 7-8 levels behind the UFO. I'm now 1 space behind it.
---
I hope so!  Sounds like a cool outfit.
---
That is true to an extent. However, if it was for that sole purpose, they could simply drop the excess stuff on the ground. The fact that they go out of their way to seek out low levels and go through the effort of trying to get their attention and give the stuff to them - that is where the kindness comes in.
---
That'd be cool.
---
But if you aren't just killing everything at Distant Thunder you're missing out on some XP. Don't let the arty do a job you can do in a shorter amount of time.
---
A company would easily go by daily numbers, we do it at work, we look at daily sales and its compared to that day last year, we *also* look at weekly and monthy sales but dailies take prority to most companies becuase they want to be able to react to situations as fast as possible, if something happens monday they want to capitalise on it tuesday, not wait a week then try for something
---
Quitters never win!
---
Daily challenges are fine. 
---
Just don't make *all* of them disappear if not completed in 24 hours. Have it where you can bank a few days worth. Other battle pass games do this, log in every other day and you can still complete the same amount of challenges, just gaining xp from non-challenge activities - like the 10,000k repeatable - will be less.
---
I think if they made some better challenges, that it wouldn't be so bad. Everyone is weary of buying 3 things from a vendor, and kill 10 super mutants/ghouls/scorched/robots. The bobblehead challenge was a good example of one that was engaging and not just checking a box upon log in.
---
Line in the sand is so much better when somebody uses a lunchbox and shares the EXP boost with everybody.
---
Couple days ago there was a bunch doing it and no one had glitches the mob spawn site.
---
And it was very fun! Everyone seemed to be into doing the event without exploiting, or mob hogging.
---
As a pure human the lack of Mutations won't hurt you in the least, nor will the limits on fast travel as I see it.  
---
The only variable that might be a pain is the Vault-Tec Pain scheme requirement.
---
I feel like it's the best compromise
---
90, played too much during double xp weekend.
---
level 50 is low, even level 200 is easy to level up by the time you are done with challenges
---
When you jam 999 rounds into a radium rifle.
---
And one of a lake
---
Eh, don’t think Bethesda will swap out one player base to dedicate challenges to another player base. Example: People who DO play every day wouldn’t agree with this, while people who DON’T play every day would agree with this. Just doesn’t seem feasible for Bethesda if they’re trying to keep shit under control.
---
Why would anyone accept a group request from a stranger?
---
Missing a day or two is not going to impact you.  With just doing dailies and weeklies (I did not do most of the NW ones unless it was deploy a camp) and my normal play time with farming I completed the run yesterday. 
---
So yous should be fine.
---
I like the idea, but from a business perspective its bad, bethesda wants you to buy the levels you cant earn, and they want you logging in every day, doing this would mean a surge in players in the final week then a drop off again
---
Just finished and I’m taking a long break. If there is a season 2 with the same idea (dailies/weeklies) I’m not participating. 
---
This has burnt me out and I regret doing it
---
Yeah , like some of the rewards are really nice are nice but it is mostly stuff I could live without. 
---
To me the biggest let down is the loss of daily and weekly atoms. it has brought the game backwards to launch where you have to do long tasks just to get 20 atoms. We do get free atoms in the run but these are too small with only 150 for something like every 20 challenges. I watched a video where a guy did the math and considering that you do all the legendary run for the 90 days or do 90 days of atom rewards there is like a drop of 80% in the atoms you get in the Run. 
---
To improve this either do as OP says and make the season a collection of weekly challenges and bring back atom dailies 
---
Make the 150 Run atoms 500 or 800 
---
Or ad a thing where you gain 40 atoms every level you progress in the Run
---
I make sure I play everyday for SCORE challenges (hoping to hit level 70 today, for example). But after that's done, if I'm gonna be playing all day (which only happens on weekends/days off), I do all the daily quests I can and as many events as I can. Mostly just trying to get plans and caps. If I'm not doing events/dailies I'm just collecting anything and everything for scrap. Sometimes I just sit at my camp so people can access my vending machines.
---
&gt; I don't know the correct answer for this since I am not big into game developing or the human psyche but I can be certain it isn't in the time that it takes to hit 782.
---
Again - why do you need to hit level 782?  I mentioned in my response up above - he didn't factor in (for example) the perk packs from seasons.
---
It is very normal for online games to release content that is supposed to be 'consumed' over a 2 year period.  And things often slowly speed up.  For example, I've seen comments about someone saying it took them a year to get to level 200.  Well - I started July 4th.  I'm level 250ish today.  (to be clear, with 0 friends playing/help).  I'm assuming part of that is - they've made it easier.
---
Now - let's say they expect this to get consumed over the next 24 months.  That is - about 10 seasons (at 2.5 months each).  Completing those - with identical rewards to today - would be worth "290 levels".  
---
And again - what's to say they won't add more ways over that same timeframe - to earn more perk cards / perk points ?
---
now I need a huge satire chicken suit to be added to the game.
---
What are you talking about? People who play everyday will get the same rewards as people who bulk play at weekends, but they will advance faster. This only means people who play at weekends will be able to get all rewards aswell.
---
How do you lose anything by allowing others get the rewards. This is just pride bullshit
---
Can you just let yourself starve to death with no repercussions? 
---
I want to be able to afk and let my camp stay up but I don't have happy camper and I'm low level so other perks take priority right now
---
I missed an entire week, and am still well ahead of the brainy doo dad
---
This sounds absolutely horrendous. 
---
Why do I want to try it now?
---
There is a workbench inside the fort, 3rd floor. The elevator and and auto walk make it a breeze.
---
true, but it still feels worse than a month ago
---
Yes, that's how I understood it too. CAMPs would be instanced. You'll probably just drop the entrance itself and then have an interior to do what you will with.
---
To be fair, chicken eggs don’t exist in the game currently.
---
True, ive missed a lot of double xp weekends in the past through being away with work
---
I am enjoying the magic shotgun, you should too.  I have magic heavies but I don’t use them on the queen.
---
Awesome! I will check that out
---
What's great about Encrypted?  Haven't been around in a while
---
For me on a weekday I only can play for 1 and a half hours. i can do it if i am beyond the median going up. i wish they wouldn't make this a challenge we get everyday.
---
But they are better than the " Level up while wearing g string while balancing and killing a wendigo collusus with your bear hands." that we had before.
---
That's a cool idea. I built my camp along the edges of the bridge by Harper's ferry for that same reason. I'm trying to make it into a market strip.
---
Why the heck would anyone want 30 turrets, they're the most useless things.
---
Spoiled meat, spoiled veggies,spoiled fruit  and toilet paper in a brown loot bag on his door step.
---
yah i noticed the same- am chasing the underarmor plans and no one ever does it anymore when i am there
---
The challenge part of challenges seems to be lost on people... it's not the free stuff rewards for b.s.... chew some bubblegum. Woohoo that was hard. Claim a workshop, dang that took all of 2 minutes to fast travel to a workshop and kill 5 ghouls. 
---
The challenges should be harder, way harder. Not every person should make it to rank 100.
---
Lol “pride bullshit”? What are you on about dude? Your assumption game is very strong, bud. 
---
What I’m saying is if you scrap out dailies, then that’s 7 days of lost challenges if you just rely on weeklies. Doesn’t seem feasible.
---
You can still destroy them with explosive weapons. I did a run the other day with my explosive fixer and was able to just shoot them and see dmg numbers on all the cores. However, I think I did manually destroy a handful before realizing I could shoot them.
---
I thin the age of the server seems to factor in. Some events like powering up power plants shouldn’t be happening more than once a serve for instance. I’m guessing the longer the servers been going the fewer events there are that repeat. Have had this happen for any sessions that go past 3-4 hours.
---
I mean. It wasn't obvious to me and I already claimed the prior rewards. I was hoping to help anyone else not make the same mistake.
---
im chasing recipes from specific events that just dont pop
---
Than door bell sound over the mic ,when he comes to investigate,  throw a molotov at it
---
Did you even bother to read the thread? It's not 7 days of lost challenges, it's just making them more flexible.
---
At an event, specifically Scorched Earth, don’t hide on top of a tent or fence.  If the queen aggros on you, she can’t find a path to land.  Also, don’t run right in front of a guy laying into the queen with a minigun or gatling weapon.  I have to get clear of you and let the barrel spin up again.
---
Didn't work for me. I actually stopped playing because of this.
---
They're taking away the negative effects of not eating soon.  
---
I've never done it but from what I've heard you don't actually die if you don't eat, it just reduces your HP to 1.
---
What!? Gah, I wish I knew this earlier. Thanks!
---
There’s been previous player posts why a cube wouldn’t work for build space. Too many variables to interact with vs a sphere that just goes an exact distance from your base point. It would be a lot if dev time for a minor QoL
---
What about mutations that you accidentally acquire? It can happen that you wind up getting some mutations from just playing the game.
---
Yeah I did. Jesus Christ, who hurt you? You’re so  angry over a comment. 
---
Yeah, it seems flexible but Bethesda won’t do it. They’re very set in their ways especially with restrictions. There’s a reason why they have dailies, to keep people coming back to check the atomic shop.
---
5.56 ammo 1 cap a piece  
---
Acid/lead for sale  
---
Mentats of various kinds  
---
Nuka Cola's of all kinds  
---
If you can make it, Formula P
---
I mean it's actually a fairly easy grind. I got suspended for 2 weeks and I've made my way up to just past 60 so far just by spending half hour doing the dailies and casually doing the weeklies. I thought it would be much more of a grind
---
When you ask about level cap, are you referring to weapons/armor? The answer is no to that. 
---
Depending on when you left, quite a bit has been added. Wastelanders is quite a bit by itself. There is a returning guide on this sub that should answer all your questions.
---
I don't like to fast travel, I just walk and dig through junk. I have 1,600 hours in and I still see sometching new everyday. There is so much more detail than just locations with icons.
---
I doubt that, I use a mod to get onscreen notifications when an event starts. But it might be possible, sure.
---
HaH!
---
Sometimes that works, yes. But sadly not all the time.
---
I was in the same server yesterday for about an hour an a half and did not see one single event pop up. They make these stupid challenges like complete X amount of events but that’s impossible when events just don’t seem to be happening as often
---
junkies is magical at 200+ rof on heavies.
---
\+33% vats hit chance is magic on shotguns. but only when using vats. and all your pellets have to hit to trigger the excess dmg.
---
Not every effect applies to every weapon.
---
Hey, we actually ended up doing this, thanks for the good shout :)
---
Got about 25 of each mass and fluid using a bloatfly technique, and we didn't even have time to really clear the whole of it.
---
So yeah, thanks my dude
---
Any decent build could never be placed via blueprints.
---
I always buy .45, 5.56, and fusion cells when they're 1cap each. Personally I have no need to buy water, meds, etc.  I'm sure you could also sell bobbles and magazines for 100 caps each. I also don't think base location matters much, but it seems like you're in a good, central location now so unless you *want* to move, you could/should stay put.
---
If you don't have it yet, that is where the fixer plan drops. Without it mumbles or the new legendary pool won't drop you one.
---
They would have to make the weekly challenges very large if they expected people to have content every day for the week.  I think the casuals need to stop thinking they can do everything in the game.  I'm loving the new daily content.  Most days it literally takes like 5 mins to get more than half the dailies done.  The problem is too many people think that if they get everything they'll miss out.  You don't have to get everything to have a good time.
---
i have had 3 events up at a time on my last play time a few days ago. I am level 30 mind you, but Line in the sand, distinguished guests, power up both power plants,  project paradise, and sime other forest event all came up for me in a less than 2 hour game session.
---
&gt; Also how would 1 do this glitch? Askin for a friend. He said he's tired of all the amazing CAMP glitches happening and not being apart of them.   
---
I will help you with your budget issue, hope you got atoms. So if you own the compact vault tec generator you place it down , you then store it and place back down as a regular shitty looking small gen, then you scrap it. This is a known budget glitch that will probably be fixed sooner than later since Bethesda likes to wreck builders fun.  You can also do it with the bundled VT blue gen but the bundle is 1200 right now whereas the compact is 500.   
---
There are a few other items that shrink budget but the FU return is terrible as you only get between 1/8-1/4 FU return making it a while for you to notice compared to a full FU return on the gen.   
---
As for how the ammo factory is done, go look it up on youtube. I will not help in assisting as I view that as malicious since so damn many assholes keep dropping them in camps of friends or randos they invite.   
---
Pro builder tip: Place 12 of the VT gens on a concrete foundation blueprint it for quick drop and stores, do not blueprint a normal gen set though for some reason the glitch will not work if pulled out that way.
---
Try playing sober.
---
Just kidding that sounds like a terrible idea!
---
Yes I did mean the cap on gear level, thanks!  That's great news I didn't want to spend another hundred hours grinding gear.
---
A weekly thread for wastelands?  Let me look for that
---
Mostly just chilling while listening to the ambient sounds and music.
---
And if that fails, you need google as the steam version might have a different name for the *.ini, just as game pass has.
---
I enjoyed Fallout 76. I have played regularly since Beta, but I'm tired! At present, I've finished the story with two characters, I've been everywhere, done the events a hundred times - I like my weapons and armour, I'm happy with my perks - but it feels like a job to log in every day so I don't miss out on anything. My OCD makes me not want to miss out on any rewards, but it is tiring, and not fun anymore. I'm not going to buy atoms, I'm not going to subscribe to Fallout First - I want to enjoy Fallout again like I did before all of this Seasons grinding.
---
Yes you can die but you will most likely be kicked for inactivity before that.
---
&gt; Formula P
---
Why do people like this chem? It didn't sound that amazing, but I'm probably missing something.
---
Well, since weekly numbers would be the cumulative total of daily logins, the weekly numbers would drop as well. 
---
Daily logins do affect their bottom line. Marketing research in MMO games has shown this. The more often players log in, the more micro transactions the company sees. Your personal spending habits may not agree but Beth is going to go with the model that shows the most sales. 
---
Beth will also use daily numbers to show executives and investors that the game is still viable and therefore deserving of continued support and development.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning is what I was referring to
---
I’ll pick up starched genes when first available. Before then, I’ll stay clean or get clean at first opportunity.
---
Big election coming up, virus scare mandating the whole country wear masks which has also somehow become a political topic. Racial tension is st an all time high and nobody listens to anything anybody else says they just want to force their opinions and president elect down your throat.
---
That annoys me a lot too.
---
Correct ive argued against this myself, but was proven wrong.  What people need to know is even though your sneak damage numbers are appearing on screen, the damage being applied is NOT your sneak damage if the enemy being target is aggrod by anything at all, be it other players or another enemy sneak damage WILL NOT be applied even though the message appears on screen and damage numbers look good.
---
Beth needs to eather fix the visual feed back or make it so sneak damage is applied on an individual basis to avoid the confusion. 
---
Angry turtle did a video on it, will have to fnd it though
---
SS armor is ugly. I cover it up always
---
I agree to that. I love the game. 500 hours and not even finished yet the dlc or main story lol. 
---
But obligation of daily play begins to burden me. A big pool of weeklies would be more consistent with the general gameplay style of most people. I love the idea of the legendary run, but it needs some tweaks.
---
I've found the booze recipes from Biv's daily sell pretty well to high levels, as well as magazines and to a lesser extent bobbleheads. I always have the perks to locate them equipped.
---
When is the double score weekend?
---
Ohhh not a bad idea.
---
I'd like to counter that there is a large difference between MMOs and single player games. I'd agree if this was a single player but almost every mmo had some way to "redo" your character, even in minor ways, for good reason. "Making a new character" isn't a viable option when it takes hundreds/thousands of hours to get to that point.
---
Granted you're also not specializing in everything at the same time so there will always be a gap to fill. I should note with the current state of the game and party system you're more likely to have an entire team with the same gaps and barely even see each other.
---
Either way the main idea is that people make mistakes and change their minds and they shouldn't be punished for that. Additionally, you should realistically be able to max out all 6 perks without reaching level 1500+
---
Ok so I rewatch the video and test mi gear. Both statements are right. Heavy guns too are benefited for those primary and secondary effects, it's just FFR making it more crazy. The most important, I'm wearing a blocker armor, and that means ANY weapon I use will have the damage buff. That explains why AAFFR with blocker armor works better than I33 with blocker armor, it's just because the first is a better weapon overall.
---
I would actually login and not get burnt out
---
.... I'm going to try this brb
---
You can actually put one of those hanging light bulbs in the coop - at night makes it worth having them.
---
Iirc Power Up activates whenever someone gets close to the plant itself. 
---
The rest of them should be special events that only activate one at a time though. Normal events can happen whenever, but ones marked with an exclamation mark are always just one at a time.
---
Several times I've started a new "scavenger" playthrough:
---
Only use what you find in game, only keep what you can carry. 
---
No FT
---
No stashboxes.
---
No vendor bots.
---
No player vending.
---
No crafting.
---
No camps.
---
Fun to play until you start hitting 20+ levels. The curve gets pretty severe after that. I enjoyed it more prior to wastelanders. The prevalence of NOC's in every area of the map now removes some of the appeal for me.
---
I buy .308, .45, and fuel whenever I can find it for 1 cap each. But other than that the goods I'm looking for from low levels is pretty limited to Diamond in the rough plans and outfits.
---
That's fair and it's your game and I can't fault you for playing how you like. I just don't think it's bad enough to use exploits.
---
I suppose you have a good point. I usually go to find people but if I'm busy I tend to drop it in front of my vendor and hope someone finds it
---
The power substation. As long as you don’t mind the local deathclaw.
---
How about getting daily challenge but making them expire in 7days ? That why it give player the choice to ether bang them out daily or for the very few of us that can only play on the weekend or days off
---
it's just a light tho. i woulda prefered a water bottle like they did for regular and cherry nuka colas.
---
It would be great because casual players would still try to progress every day so they don't mound up while also giving them breathing room.
---
Rough until 20+ , limited to hunting rifle and laser til then for weapons, Combat shotty and assault rifles  til minigun (couple for fun weapons in there to: flamer and Farman). Leather, metal and combat armors til I can wear T-45 PA at 25 (no Excavator VT paint, sadly).
---
Oof
---
Ngl you seem more annoyed than the op
---
Np! I also have a magic shotgun build that I'm working on that I'm willing to share. Though the build I linked is easier to play
---
Ive had that too. But the only way its tamable is if it spawns alone. So you would just leave worlds and farm the area until you get it
---
Thanks!
---
Same. I just don't have the motivation to do chores with my free time before getting off to do more work and chores irl.
---
With the new casual groups, earning levels is not that complicated. But if you less than 1 hour to play daily, i can why how it becomes complicated
---
You can take it more than once and the effects stack making even the most god awful spread fire weapons be like a laser beam.  Which is a nice advantage, especially with magic weapons and how they seem to work.
---
I'm always shocked to hear that people actually chose one of the other two names for that drink. It's like doing the DMV quest and not saying your name is George Washington. Unthinkable.
---
Its a vidual bug, it shows sneak damage numbers and a message in the corner of the screen butnonly normal damage is being applied. Angry turtle has a video on it. At work so cant really watch them to find out which one it is. See my comment to the other guy on this thread
---
Achievement unlocked: Land Grabber!
---
You can buy it with scout badges, in scout vending machine
---
Unlike Shotgunners, commandos can happily murder things from extreme range using vats and high perception, as any rifle you pick up basically becomes a fully automatic sniper rifle.
---
In regards to The Fixer is not as op as its made out to be, its just the best overall weapon for stealth rifle/commando builds due to its combination of dmg, rof, mag size, and its built in stealth perks. Handmades and vanilla combat rifles will still perform strongly in the hands of a stealth build.
---
A bit too rough for me... I need my stash/scrap box too much.
---
I’m going pure though, no ‘help’ from my high level characters regardless of how bad I want a plan or legendary they are holding. That’s going to be the hardest part of sticking to this I think.
---
That's pretty cool, I knew there had to be something I wasn't considering!
---
Yes!  Placed my camp there in hopes of seeing an occasional missile launch.  Discovering that I could actually use the artillery to blow up Blood Eagles was a bonus.  There is also a random encounter spot nearby...one encounter consists of a crashed vertibot full of ghouls.
---
What about the firefly lamp? 
---
Talk about getting something SMALLER than expected. 
---
Has Bethesda seen the size of an Appalachia firefly(you would think they would have since they created them)? 
---
What they have in that jar are pre-great war fireflies - really ruins the immersion
---
Ah i see
---
Looks cool. I’ll wait for the first one to be bought and reviewed.  
---
Could go the route of the nuka rum and duffel bag.
---
Fuel and cryo cells @ 1c/ea I instabuy. I also pick up nuke cards, berry mentats, and (if needed) scrip weapons @ 100c/star. I wont pay over 50c/star for armor scrip. If anyone sells stable flourescent flux it's another instabuy.
---
People would still buy levels, they just wouldn't be forced to.
---
Casual players with busy lives would still log in as often as possible so they don't pile up but would also give them breathing room till they had time to sit down and play for a few hours.
---
Alternatively you could cap out all dailies to a week/month and all weeklys to a month. That way people are still "forced" to play semi regularly.
---
Cool, I'm just going to keep trying for secret service then, and put my gold towards the t-65.
---
Turn Pacifist on, problem solved.
---
Ammo is probably gonna be the lion’s share of your income for a while.    I buy nuka cola wherever I see it, I buy most materials.
---
Chems are another safe bet, I buy all the mentats I find.   Lots of people buy gunpowder to save themselves some acid, but that’s pretty heavy to have in a vendor for its value.
---
Another thing you can sell is neat junk, like protection models, clean globes, anything you think someone might want in a display case and don’t see often.
---
I actually really like the dailies. It takes me logging in every day to get the weeklies anyway and I don't make nearly as much progress as I'd like to on the board with the weekly challenges alone. The dailies are an easy 1k score every day, amounting to 7k score a week, versus the weeklies which are only 5k or 6k. Doing both, you rack up a pretty amount of score. Bethesda, if they eliminated the dailies, would not increase the weeklies and we'd never get to the end of the board without buying ranks.
---
The info you find out in the Enclave shows that they unleashed all sorts of stuff to increase the defcon level in order to access the nuke silos. They succeeded, but one of the things they unleashed was the scorchbeasts.
---
Usually in the early afternoon.
---
Level is irrelevant. If you're playing without pacifist mode on you're open to pvp. That's that.
---
WOW!! when did they raise the CAP limit.
---
Curious as to Whitespring Golf Course clears, I havent been there in a while but I remember I could clear the whole place in around a minute if they aggroed properly. Probably not near as good exp per clear but there is no instanced load screen to get to the mobs. There were also 3 possible magazine and bobblehead spawn locations? Also the sulfur fountain right near where you spawn in, so thats a bonus if you do get hit and get rad worms. Plus its also a good place to get salt/spices/sugar for the food buffs and The nuka cola cooler by the pool also seems to have a higher chance for nuka cola quantum than other ones Ive run into.
---
I'm always buying copper or fuel or the resources to make it, junk sells pretty good in general,as does raw ore and bobbleheads/maps/drugs
---
I didn't know that was a thing. Thanks!
---
i like how you're obviously talking about irl but it could refer to the game as well.
---
-the brotherhood of steel coming back with a story called "factured steel" implies there will be a schism and we'll have to choose which side is in charge (a big election)
---
-scorched plague, and how the settlers and raiders dont believe its serious at first (virus scare)
---
-fasnacht happened again, and the atomic shop plus the Legendary Run seasonal rewards means cosmetics as FOMO as ever and some dont like that (masks are a political statement)
---
-okay this one is a stretch but i'm gonna level it at ghouls and how they could go feral at any moment (racial tension)
---
-a good chunk of the fanbase is angry for a variaty of reasons (nobody listens and wants to shove opinions down throats)
---
How is that fair?  I made around 8000 bullets with 1 run of Lucky hole mine, naturally just picking up all weapons from enemies for steel and 1 short run for acid.  It's SO easy to make ammo.
---
Make daily challenges reward atoms and weekly reward score .  A man can dream
---
Before SS armor I never wore an outfit.  I love the look of the armor ( combat, marine, robot, trapper ) but since SS armor is basically far superior to the rest I’ve started using outfits cause SS armor is ugly as fuck.
---
Inventory management. Even with FO1st...
---
This was not a problem until wasteland. I could easy pick up (and I counted a few times) 300-400 weapons with no lag. Now the meat piles cause lag that before I pick them up.
---
Plus stop seeking revenge. If you just respawn you only can get killed once.
---
It's in game options. With it on it will disable pvp anywhere other than workshops.
---
Berry mentats. Make those and sell them idle 50caps each
---
Scorchbeast parts, farm the vissures 4 me? Thnx
---
I always wanted to try it but didn't have a chance until they decided to not support it anymore.
---
IF you have a decent enough weapon, it shouldn't matter.
---
I'll have to agree that managing inventory isn't fun or intuitive.
---
I have fallout 1st and even a second account with bank alts to make transferring easier/safer and even with a whole second account I basically have to drop what I'm doing and go drop off my extra stuff.
---
I should also note that I'm running weight reduction stuff as well but those don't apply to stash.
---
i hope not. my magic quad db shotgun is awesome.
---
but im sure it will be eventually.
---
Ooh, that. I have no badges😂😂 too bad
---
How could you do that to him!? I’m mad just by reading this &gt;:(
---
I have a 275 and a 130 and always have, but that's because I don't know the unlegit way
---
The van is comin. They bringin the spiked ban hammah.
---
Reading this title was a r/nononoyes roller coaster in the NSFW department.
---
To be honest, I prefer any of the other names. When I saw the option to call it "my blood's in it" I thought nobody would be that mad to choose it lol.
---
I only like it because at this point is more of a meme than anything else.
---
It’s just one tadpole badge, super quick to get.
---
I'm glad more people have started doing it. It's a collaborative event, and the more the merrier.
---
Its the little things that so many people overlook, i love finding animals doing animal things. Like the occasional sheepsquatch sleeping in a nest
---
I don’t know how. Do you have the flag? If so can you place one down at my camp? Or two?
---
I think it's because more and more people have completed the score event so no need to grind anymore.
---
Considering that you can also crash servers with them and repeat the score-challenges ad infinitum, you better also take all the workshops available and stick those machines there too.
---
I am sure Beth will fix that shit.
---
I hope he looted Taggedy's access card off her body.
---
Also, you can get some decent Level 50 Combat Armor off her too.
---
What is Bethesdas obsession with Fertilizer
---
Dude, I have a hard enough time killing the 3 legendaries and claiming the 5 workshops. People like to contest all my workshops for PVP and one shot all the legendaries during any event. And they don't spawn often enough in the wild, in my experience.
---
Unless your character has taken the time read the notes and entries in Fallout 76.
---
Here are links to BoS holotapes with Roger Maxson's thoughts on what he thinks the Brotherhood of Steel 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/About_the_Brotherhood
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Preservation_of_technology
---
It was my understanding that even with One Wasteland, enemies would not exceed their zone level caps.  I’ll have to re-read the information on that.
---
I do and if you’re XB1 I think I could, not sure if it’s character locked but it may be since it’s an unlockable plan. Anyway, go in your menu to challenges, all the way down to character, and toward the bottom of that list are the Tadpole/Possum scout challenges to get badges.
---
Considering it's like $20 I have low expectations for this thing's quality.
---
This game needs difficult content. I'm all for taking the easy option eith stuff like building challenges but it's a bit dumb to kill 10 scorched at Morgantown when there's also xp and level up challenges going.
---
Daily atom rewards were already small enough to begin with, or do you not remember the subreddit bitching about it every other day?
---
Minigun.  Despite what people think, it's not hard to keep full of ammo.  You really don't need ultracite, it already does enough damage as it is.  I get 1000+ headshots.  2 mm em cartridges are easy to make, I just made about 8000 in half an hour or so.  Have fun mowing down everything.  Pretty easy to get a magic effect to, magic and bloodied together is great.
---
It tells you when you reach level 5 about pvp
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNARr5Mevxw
---
That's true - but if you don't feel like searching for a powerful crossbow (for example), you can do the challenges currently using any random crossbow you find or craft since there are areas where you can kill lvl 1 scorched. However, once those scorched are boosted in level, it will take multiple shots to kill them instead of just one. So it makes it so that you will need to seek out a more powerful crossbow in order to really complete these challenges.
---
Are you okay? Do you need a hug?
---
but you are not lv 105. no one cares.
---
Dang. I’m on ps4. It’s not player locked cause my buddy before placed one down
---
I travel for work and literally cannot play every day. 
---
Looks like Fo76 isn’t the game for me then. 
---
They removed atoms for dailies &amp; weeklies and put them into a system where I can barely make one or two atom unlocks. There’s no incentive for me to play regularly anymore.
---
Thanks anyway
---
honestly Backpack part should be real easy to do, you just have to make a fake model/texture that literally nothing (so it doesn't end up as the ! of missing model and all) and put it as a backpack skin option like all the others.
---
I have the Quantum one and is pretty neat, and judging by the pictures it looks like is going to be the same product/mats.
---
Anything that adds a bit more challenge and interest, to be honest.
---
Reading that made my back hurt knowing how long you went at it... you really gotta optimize your build farm better legendaries.
---
No problem. For real though, those challenges are super quick, especially just to get one badge just quickly do a simple challenge.
---
Well you have to hit a load screen to fast travel, an it's better to just to hit the same better location over and over.  I like to mix it up and hit other locations, as it gets really tedious doing the same thing over and over.
---
I mean if the photo is anything to go by, it actually just looks cheap as shit. One piece plastic form up and over. Even in comparison to the boxart it looks hilarious.
---
 I get the meme and the desire etc, and honestly the price is lower than I would've expected, which is *kinda* good I guess if you just want it,  but I have no doubt it will be epically rubbish.
---
Dailies made me play the game less I would log in to do the dailies, hate I was doing dailies and log off as soon as my last one finished. No incentive to do big fights at all.
---
If you scrap enough drills, you can get a bladed bit mod that increases dmg/AP. The rest is perks/mutations.
---
Drills will always be lvl 20.
---
Thank you for explaining that eloquently. However, as many have stated it's all just keep daily numbers up so that they have positive reports to their stakeholders. What they don't take into account is if people have fun, but they don't care about that.
---
You can keep farming exp but unless those rewards mean that much or you're leveling up for later, it's not worth it.
---
Some friends and I used to all camp around anchor farm.   Hits all your requirements
---
Junk. Learn how to farm it and price it low. Players routinely clean out my junk machine.
---
You do not die, you take damage per second until you reach 1HP, that's when the damage per second stops and you will remain there, with a full red AP bar ofcourse
---
Edit: spelling
---
Your mods appear to be in the correct data folder.
---
You have to make the custom ini file.
---
I think the reason is that game updates might re-write the "Fallout76.ini" file, so to preserve mods through updates, you copy copy the "Fallout76.ini" and rename it "Fallout76Custom.ini"
---
Then delete any unchanged settings and add your archives.
---
I dunno, but my friend says everytime he uts some in his vendor its the first thing sold every time, usually within minutes
---
perhaps if bethesda, ik it could be too much.. but get the vc to come and record some more of them?
---
Scorched are easy enough to one-shot with a strong enough weapon and their challenges only ask to kill around 76 of them, so that's not the biggest of deals. I cleaned up all those challenges with the Project Clean Appalachia event last year. 
---
The robot challenges will be harder, but unless Mr. Handy bots start scaling up to Mr. Gutsy tier, I don't think too much will change. The best places to progress those challenges are the Fertile Soil event with Mr. Farmhands, and at the Whitesprings which already scales up to max enemy levels.
---
yeah, I always look for berry mentats
---
Right on!
---
Yea it would have to be A LOT of xp
---
its my favourite game atm, i can log on and just idly farm legendaries, rare plans, build new camps (i get a new idea every week or so and put it in place, take some pics, then have another crack)
---
i take time to do my rep quests, SBQ kill or two, lob a nuke at Whitespring and farm fluxes for my serums, etc
---
always seems to be plenty to do. Am starting a new toon this week, keen to give my bloodied 50 cal a whirl on a heavy weapons toon!
---
that describes me lol
---
I completely agree with you about the need for difficult content. I am just trying to get the word out to people about this so that they don't end up regretting not having done the challenges pre-one wastelander. Some people out there don't like the extra challenge.
---
check near train stations for Bots on Parade, or near towns for the Blast ones...weird thing was, when I needed them to become genral I couldn't find them so I went look for huge legendaries to get points, then once I got to be general they were everywhere!
---
I got better shit to do with my tent than use it at the queen fight. Beside someone else always has theirs down so I just jump on theirs
---
Im not saying people wont ever buy levels, but a lot more people will be buying levels in a few weeks just before the event ends and they know they wont make it in time.  
---
Also like I said, they want people logging in every day and seeing the atom shop every day, makes people a lot more likely to buy stuff
---
There really needs to be a better gameplay loop. The entire loop right now is a boring grind of daily/weekly challenges, tedious and repetitive reputation missions and replaying the same handful of events for the millionth time for Gold. There should be like crazy dungeons/raids where you can earn stacks of gold or something like that, you know something other than picking up wood, or saying the same 3 lines to a retired raider. The game just is not engaging, and once you finish Wastelanders story, and the normal story, there is literally nothing to do but the same events over and over, and pick up wood type chores.
---
Eh... if you have trouble killing 10 level 50 scorched when you are level 50 I think you have a problem
---
yeah.. its a huge drag
---
selfish to the core...
---
Why? The Atom Shop is only getting updated once a week so their only interest is having players to log WEEKLY.
---
wasn't this debunked a while ago? I'm hardly qualified to talk about the queen so I wouldn't know.
---
I don’t think there will be a zone level cap, rather a cap for each enemy type.
---
Unless the person she wants to attack is on the ground, she won't land.
---
I just find it funny that because so little concrete was donated (because it a pain to get in large numbers like steel) the quota was lowered to 15 million.  Yet so far over 100 million cork has been donated, its gotta have been duped, because i could be wrong, but one cork per pipe weapon, golf ball and crystal decantor, plus globes and its soul destroying traveling around and collecting so little,  2-3 hundred in a given time.  I could be completly wrong and may have missed a trick for it and will gladly adopt the idea!
---
I find that if there was fun content inside the game I play it more and log in more than logging in daily to chew gum and crit a few times.
---
Edit: OMG! Thanks for the updoots kind strangers of Reddit!
---
Edit 2: OMG GOLD?! You're too kind! Thanks so much!
---
Most likey coexist. Due to their player instance. Whatever happen outside happen outside. However the more "important" people and choices happen inside these instance. They will probably figure a way to connect all instance together so the 2 faction interact with the BOS.
---
I wish I got that one. I got nuka scorched and regret it every day
---
I gotta be honest.... queen fights are over in three minutes or less anyway. I’d like to say my staying on the ground and hitting less hard matters, but mostly I’m just trying to hit her enough so I get credit for the kill before someone just shreds her.
---
Just ignore it.
---
Fact or theory. I'm guessing theory. The majority of scorchbeast queen or normal they just dont land its probably intended. But I know how annoying it is  believe me.
---
I am not talking about difficulty in doing it. I am talking about the convenience of completing challenges. It will be more convenient to do them now rather than wait.
---
I either one shot them without any damage perks, or they survive and whole pack suddenly gets heart attack and they all die at once. Only way is to hop servers, this changes your targets for the quest.
---
Good luck with it. I wouldn't trade Marsupial and Speed Demon at all. You better hold onto a lot of Rad-X and Radaway, because you can get mutations just from walking around with radiation for a long time. My low level 12 character got a mutation yesterday when I was doing the challenges and I only had a small amount of rads showing.
---
This would invalidate my collection of gum lol. At least make the challenges fun and interesting so I dont log in to see how fast I can finish the challenges. 
---
Also take out the NW daily I hate it and I dont like doing it and it takes away time I would spend in the main game.
---
It's people on the fences too, I don't usually mind since the fight never lasts more than 5 minutes if I drag it out either way.
---
I'm like level 70 now, should I farm xp or something like that?
---
I may have to play on the PTS this weekend if I can and have a taste on how the game will feel with this new system.   If every encounter is a slog fest with common mobs becoming bullet sponges when trying to do mundane tasks that might take some of the fun out of using less than optimal weapons for flavor.
---
For example I carry a light weapon normally that uses common ammo on trash mobs.  A side arm so to speak.  Saving my plasma cartridges  for more worthy mobs.  But if I start having to use heavy weapons every time I step out of my camp then that is going to make these side arms rather useless.
---
Also I do wonder how this will affect camp turrets.  I live in the mire where level 60 plus mobs like to throw themselves against my camp defenses.  how is this change going to affect them? If the mob lowers down to the turret level, then would there be a point is going for the higher level turrets?
---
So many questions, the cool thing is I guess I can find out this weekend if Beth does update the PTS as stated.
---
Perfect, thanks. Now to find that head totem lol
---
My vendor machines accept payment in the form of pistachio nut shells...
---
Are there specific tent spots that make a difference? Or tents in general? 
---
The server I was on last night did two SBQ fights back to back. I counted 3 tents. None of them prevented her from landing. Great fights, too. I made sure to give the guy who launched the nukes a heart emoji.
---
I have a mule alt
---
I finished it a few nights ago and u look back at what u got from 1-100 n it’s so disappointing tbh n now I’m trying to find something to do coz we can still do the daily’s but it just seems pointless now
---
Good, finally a challenge.
---
I think you may have confused the BOS with the Enclave...
---
I'd go for SBQ. The one who started Encryptid will learn to not burn a card when a nuke is landing.
---
its going to make material farming in the forest to conserve ammo and save wear and tear on your gear harder too..
---
awesome job fellow dweller. you need a case of nuka cola dark for your efforts, you earned it. not only doing it solo (i did the same quest solo) but with a melee and then just bare fist, now that takes balls.
---
i remember doing the same quest.... belly of the beast i believe it is called. i went in at a slightly higher level than you (70ish) went in with 4 guns (3 rifles and 1 shotgun).... by the time the quest was done only my sniper rifle was left unbroken and it was almost there itself. its one hell of a battle but well worth it. lets not forget the countless scortchbeasts you gotta fight before even getting to the caverns, i remember fighting 6 of them.
---
I finished last night. Kinda feels like the rewards from the Atlas runs they are doing. So let down.
---
When she flies over endlessly cropdusting, that's her aggro on a fence or tent boi- you can actually see it happening. It also happens a lot just at v9 because the fencing stops her getting to people. Unless you run out and let her whack you in their place she will mostly just take off again.
---
There's no doubt that the fight has it's issues and is buggy as all fuck in a lot of ways, but when she's aggroing on people on top of stuff, it makes a huge difference.
---
I do fairly decent damage output with my ultracite gatling laser, and I can pull her aggro fine most of the time and drag her away from there so she actually behaves "normally". If you do it solo ever, she behaves in a massively different way if you're not shooting her in the air using specific perk cards, and you aren't stood on stuff.
---
It's by no means infallible, but there is enough evidence about to show that it's an issue.
---
I'm far more concerned that it follows ESO where you can pretty much destroy anything outside of dungeons without trying. Especially as we don't have dyngeons.
---
This is the likely cause.  It's probably why Line in the Sand, while still always run, has fewer people than a couple weeks ago.
---
Once the legendary run is over, there's less point to getting XP unless people are prepping for legendary perks.
---
i've seen her land and then "scurry" over a tent
---
Im 5 space from being done. I have a job, so i made up for it by spending my atoms from fallout 1st on spaces
---
I’m gonna test that. Thanks for sharing the info!
---
Fair point, I’m definitely not a big fan of grinding like this.
---
I work a pretty busy job atm, trying to squeeze the time in was stressful and there was other games I wanted to play. 
---
Just from the end result, I wouldn’t do it or something similar again
---
Order now, available never.
---
I'm such a weenie, I chose "vaccinated" bc I thought the overseer would be mad if I chose "my bloods in it" (which is the one I really wanted). I thought she'd say it was a bad choice and now no one would be vaccinated and I'd get bad dialog options. ☹️ You bet your ass my second character went with My Blood's In It though!!
---
Dude. I understand your pain. However. It seems that the low level players don't actually look through options and just think that it they hit someone. There won't be consequences. And. I remember in beta, the game actually warned you about turning on pacifist if you don't want PvP. I don't know if it still does that because I'm 352 but I completely understand your pain and am not trying to be rude. This goes to ALL low levels
---
Ah yeah I've seen a couple of those camps, cool but in the middle of nowhere
---
Honestly my husband and mine’s BIGGEST pet peeve right now. We keep running into D-bags one shotting the legendaries during events, ESPECIALLY One Violent Night. We’re all there for the same reason, so why are you being aholes about it??
---
Best experiences we’ve had recently were level 200+’s who will use the “come here” emote when a legendary pops up and then wait for everyone to get a hit (usually punching 😂) before killing the thing. We’ve taken to doing that as well.
---
Sometimes I just treat it as a virtual holiday from work, logging on and just letting my character stroll around, doing whatever pops up
---
Be a real failure of an mmo to have people log in once a week
---
Cue main menu music
---
I do that once in a while when I want to try my solo build. I don’t have fo1st, I call it the commoner’s strategy!
---
Line in the sand is a gold mine if you can tag the scorch beast that drops fast enough.
---
This happens to me after the game has been running for a period of time - I get a connection error and the character menu disappears from the main screen, and I have to restart the game. I’ve just gotten in the habit of closing the game completely every time I finish playing. On Xbox BTW.
---
The ability to play as a Ghoul could be interesting.
---
Super Mutant? I think the code changes required might be more than the system could handle. 
---
But, the idea of having "professions" or "faction-related" characters would add a dimension to the game we don't have currently.
---
Right now, we're all sill 76'ers....
---
Now I'm dreaming of a turn-based RPG with different Fallout classes.
---
Then just buy ranks with atoms 
---
-Bethesda 
---
It being a incredibly demanding grind is the point it drives people to purchase ranks especially since it’s a free battle pass
---
I only get time to play 3-4 days a week, but I do not have problem with daily challenges I only wish they would not be the major contributor to the season.
---
Maybe tone down the number of dailies and give few more weeklies.
---
Convenience items at rock bottom prices. 
---
Lightweight scrip trash like Knuckles or Weightless armors for 30-100 per star, ammo at 1 cap each(.45/5.56/5mm/.50/2mm/cryo/fuel/gamma/arrow/plasma/fusion cell/shell: don't bother with .38/.44/10nm or explosives), chems like Antibiotics/Formula P/Overdrive/RadShield that take a conscious effort to farm, and for good measure maybe stock a few non-legendary Radium Rifles and Ultracite lasers since unlocking their mods is such a colossal pain.
---
I have and still do buy all of these when the prices are agreeable. At Whitespring, you shouldn't have any difficulty selling them. The few times I had a vendor by Whitespring, I was raking in over 10k hourly and running out of stock so fast it became a job on it's own to both keep stocked and stay under 30k. And this is probably on the lower end of Whitespring profits. I have no doubt better vendors pull much better numbers than I do.
---
Its ultracite power armor with acid damage effects, i use it and its awsome
---
Had this happen to me when I was doing the DMV part of the main quest.
---
I think i read somewhere that you need to put your soldier's certificate into your stash and take it back out.
---
It had bugged on me during the DMV, thinking I hadn't gotten the certificate, so had to do that to get it to progress.
---
*laughs in flechette harpoon gun*
---
Yeah, once the event is complete it should list your rewards and you get the flux straight into your inventory. I'm not sure how long it takes to 'fix' into your inventory but I know if you die just after she dies it vanishes
---
My favorite event since i started the game
---
I'm very optimistic about it. The ESO community talks about that when their version of one wasteland was applied, it improved the game a lot.
---
FO76 is following the freemium model. They need the daily log in incentives to push that model.
---
I would argue making events scale better so that all events have decent rewards and making fast travel to them free would be better.
---
So true, did 3 runs yesterday morning and a guy one next to the fence and he and I'm guessing his buddy jumped up on the fence, it took 15mins a fight, and she rarely landed
---
Do all activities reward SCORE or is it JUST challenges? Because the latter is just...terrible game design.
---
I would have liked it to have gone a more rpg route like that with races and classes. They could throw in race changes to an extent. A dunk in the FEV or a wander in the rads could have folks less human. I'd kinda hoped legendary perks would change the build balance a bit but that looks highly unlikely. This game is like playing WoW but everyone rolled a rogue at the moment.
---
I feel like plenty of other games are far more successful without having to worry about tactic like that
---
If it isnt worth it then dont do it.
---
Youd have to stop the main quest when you got to the point where Rose needs you to kill a Yao Guai, as well as various side quests that require crafting. Otherwise this is a really nice idea that I may try to get me back into the grittier side of the game.
---
No doubt players would stay logged in longer if we had more substantial content but I think that is far less important to the company than keeping daily logins high. I speculate that they would prefer you log off sooner than later. This makes space for other players to do their daily logins without Beth having to open more servers.
---
If you're farming xp it's not that bad but it's hard to do, casually. Even then it's not really enough to make up.
---
Stand outside Whitesprings station.
---
Wear something sexy...
---
I think it's more about taking up potential spots she can land, cause I've seen her do the same
---
In the literall sense no, But you know what he means.
---
Put the rarest outfit you have on 'em, just for swag points.
---
After work my fiance takes a bath and i crawl the wastes of Appalachia
---
Check out Fallout - The board game
---
I have chosen one of each, so that I can collect the whole set. I made one at the chemistry bench afterwards and then transferred them to my main account.
---
Freemium model on a paid game. Nice.
---
While it is true all their DLC are free and seasons are free, it still doesn't justify it since the free DLCs are small DLCs. Nothing compared to NV DLCs where each one is a whole new world
---
Yeah that's fair enough. I put in a lot of hours grinding for Legendaries so the run for me seemed fairly relaxed lol
---
Nice😂😂
---
This was something they wanted to do in FNV but didnt have enough time to do it.
---
did you or your server immediately crash?
---
I’m going to start calling these people “24/76ers”
---
"I don't want to do it anymore" Is reasonable. Like you said. I don't feel like it's nessacary or hard to make ammo but I also see how it might take away for others.
---
What, why didin't you take photos, would have loved to see that.
---
You mean the non-PA mods?
---
You can try the typical Raider Vendors - Pleasant Valley, R&amp;G Station, etc.
---
yeah, plus especially once you get towards the end, the daily quests give so little rank anyway
---
It would be a cool feature but what would be the story of the game for a mutie? Each race would have to have their own story/quest. Super mutants in 76 are also a new race so not much to go on there I feel. I think a spin off game would be more suited to this, which would be fun!
---
No it's not.  If you don't want to play the game anymore, stop playing the game.
---
How do you fit a pump shotgun in that little thing? Asking for a friend
---
Yeah, and some builds need that 8000 rounds tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day...... Or even more than once a day depending on what event theyre running
---
They could farm the mats to craft it, or shop for all the mats. Or they just hop around to a few vendors with ammo and clean them out.
---
And since caps become pretty useless for some players, they might as well.
---
Yeah I'm hoping it comes back in the shop in the next couple weeks, they've been promoting raider items and it's long overdue to return.
---

---
A little off topic.. Ive always wondered why they didnt let you pick your SPECIAL at the beginning of the game and then fill in the perks as you level like other FOs..
---
I use a minigun.  I am that build, it's not hard.
---
They’re all part of the same building set. The prefab buildings all belong to the same category on the menu similar to lights
---
Just daily and weekly challenges. Nothing else awards SCORE (except a repeatable XP challenge that awards 100 SCORE each 10.000 XP which is nothing). And you have to complete all of them + the repeatable one 5 times a week to finish the season (they did increase the number of dailies from 7 to 9 mid-season and what I just said is based on 7 daily challenges but still)
---
How many have you stored?
---
When you move, all stuff gets stored and some things blueprinted. Anyways, stored stuff counts towards your budget.
---
It probably would be.
---
But since when has bethesda ever made the better decision?
---
Nocturnal has the most available equipment and perks specifically meant for that build. I doubt that one gets changed.
---
I would like to mention the Nuka Cola machine beverage cooler I bought didn't last a year :-/ so you can add that to the list of sub-par Products bought from Beth's Store.
---
It is fucking ugly. I’m still rockin scout because i can’t stand looking like a cheap halloween Michelin man on jenny craig
---
Yes it was.
---
My RP is the exact opposite. Im all about my big ol BOS bois. I roll around as a bs scribe (i know its lame...) got my toon dressed in bos scribe outfit and ss helmet (only helm that looks good with it really), BOS fortress and a wall of "research" to go with it. Id love to see a big showing of them in game. What i want more that that though is some friggin end game content plzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Chickens secretly hate him...
---
Good for you? 
---
It doesn't change the fact that I, and many other players sell thousands and thousands of hours. 
---
Because some people would rather just buy it than farm the mats for it.
---
You make me mentat variants and there's a 100% chance I buy them. Mainly orange, but I'm a sucker for all of them.
---
maybe they will have less shitty challenges and the extra .1s required to kill each enemy wont matter?
---
Too many rads? You have the chance to turn your character to a Ghoul (which would be funny to see all the Bloodied Builds get ghoulified)....
---
Making good content is "hard." Trying to force us to chew gum every day is easy.
---
I thought it was already proven that the reason why she doesn't land sometimes is because people are shooting her in the air with stagger perks like tank killer and one gun army.
---
Whenever I am at a Queen fight and she is taking forever to land I notice there are many folks shooting her in the air and it looks like she is stuck in a stagger animation loop.
---
Gotcha, I’ll get a blocker armor and see how crazy it gets lol. Does it get crazier if I wear five pieces of blocker armors instead of just one?
---
Yep. Didn't do it. Will continue to not do it, and feel just fine about it. For all of its issues (and there are a lot) Division 2 at least got its battle pass right. Every activity contributes and you don't have to log in every day to hit the cap. Far from it. Even Modern Warfare's battle pass challenges don't expire so you can play catch up if you need to.
---
What is this all about?
---
Rip games that are games to be games you know :(
---
I'd hoped for professions too. The fact of choosing a faction to be part of and sticking to it. Or they could add the ability for players to create their own factions/clans. It might be a way to do impromptu PvP events. Though i hate pvp, I'd be down to start a faction with my buddies and fight others
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
You have to farm for something, if you try to buy it, you have to hop from vendor to vendor and even then you may not find enough.  Caps still require work to get, you have to farm them too, but you can only get 1400 a day.  Getting the materials would honestly be less time consuming than buying bullets out right.
---
You can find a tamable chicken in the world. In fact my chicken lasted longer than any of my other pets.
---
this sounds eerily familiar but it happened a few days ago. 
---
i'm on xbox, but my level is in the 170's. i was playing with a low leveled friend showing him a few events and another player that was following me around was at my camp (its right under the gorge bridge) messaged me saying that some low level character was shooting up my camp. when i got there the person was shooting my turrets and wasn't saying anything so to defend my land i attacked. and this person kept coming back. didn't seem too happy, but i don't like my camp being attacked. as yes said other player attacked this person as well. i don't know if that was you or not. i had pacifist on, but when the attacker kept shooting i got annoyed, took it off and just went to town on them.
---
Want us to call you a wambulance?
---
Yep it’s like telling everyone ‘hey I’m all about food’...
---
Nailed it!
---
No I’m good
---
Then stop jumping on top of my tent.THAT prevents her landing,not my tent. I already have to move it 10 times a minutes to shake off those little caterpillars who would be shredded in 5 seconds on the ground.
---
I would still login and play daily if they were just weeklies.
---
That would be a quite interesting development. I'm not sure how hp management would work but it would be good to be able to go into blast zones with unyielding armor.
---
[Sub_bot21] got wrecked by (Intentional Game Design)!
---
Sorry, bub. Nothing personal.
---
Does the SBQ have the same mechanics as a regular 2* SB? Because there have been times I'm fighting a 1* or 2* alone and I'm on the ground the whole time and she never lands. Other times, same scenario but I'm on my tent and she will land? Neither one are consistent, but seems to not really matter where I am? I can't find any logic to it. Maybe there are places where she couldn't land in the bog (where I was fighting alone) because of all those trenches? Idk.. it's a hotly disputed issue but there doesn't seem to be any consistency in it.
---
You don’t want to know the secret ingredient..
---
Hmmm....immune to radiation, but you lose 50% of your HP.
---
I did them all a year ago anyway.
---
Nope, can’t agree. It’s literally part of the game. I’ve had people take my junk and I just move on.
---
And yes I get that I’m Complaining about a video game but I Lost a lot of fulx and plastic like 6hrs Worth sooo I’m kind of mad
---
Yeah this is what’s needed. I work 12 hours 3-4 days a week.  Logging on during work day to play for a couple hours makes it like work. I could smash weeklies easily.
---
Personally I'd say they should double the amount of dailies (let's say 16) but only make it so you can do 8. The point here is to increase the options for dailies so that you are more likely to accomplish them by playing how you want to and not having to go "oh, what do I need to do now".
---
Having it reward you while playing your way is good, forcing you to do specific things outside of your playstyle is bad.
---
So let's say, out of the 16 dailies: 4 are building related. 4 are quest related. 4 are kill related (kill x amount of x), and 4 are scavenging related.
---
As an example, if the kill dailies are 10 scorched, or 10 super mutants, or 10 ghouls, or 10 animals. The chances that you'd accomplish atleast one if not multiple during your REGULAR play is high.
---
This would make it more of a passive thing. And that's be cool to me. Just a thought.
---
Got it, I I have 3/3 special\* buildings. Tyvm
---
When my group finishes daily quests/ challenges, collects scrip and bullion, and tops off whatever else they have to do, we play games! We make up different things to do every so often. Right now were finding relatively low level characters and running them through a "gauntlet" of sorts. We follow them around and shoot all of their enemies with a karma syringer 😂 and see how they do. Usually they die, but one level 12 did really well yesterday and we invited him to come play with us. Now we're giving him a meta player perspective on the game he wouldn't have gotten otherwise, and he gets to decided how he wants to play a lot earlier than he would have had we not found him.
---
What if you lost 6hrs Worth of flux
---
Same here, and I properly quit.  I come back hungry/thirst, all food and veggies spoiled.  I thought that’s how it was supposed to be like maybe it was a survival mode type of thing
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks again.
---
Pure flux mind you
---
That was my concern, but with nothing stored I thought there might be something buggy going on. Ty
---
Ummm. No?
---
There are plenty of high level players who are almost nearly always maxed out on caps......
---
And it's no problem to quickly buy the ammo you need.  When you see a vendor that has 10,000 ammo listed in their vendor box on the map.... That player is likely only selling bulk popular ammo. 
---
I've been selling ammo since beta. When shotgun shells were easy money on Market. 
---
Just because you will spend the time to farm for mats, or have to take time to earn caps, doesn't mean everyone else does.  For many a high level player coming to my camp and dropping 8k to stock up on ammo for their heavy build isn't a big deal.
---
I wouldn’t bc I would stash immediately
---
I was thinking something along the lines of waking up in westek and starting the game with a limited story. Though im not sure haha
---
Why didn't you stash it? Just curious
---
Nah, it’s from Grenadier of course
---
At this rate of nukings they're never going to get that mailbox fixed.
---
I really don't like most of the music from Inon Zur in any of the Fallout games. I am distracted by it.
---
I wish they could have gotten Mark Morgan from Fallout 1&amp;2.
---
Instead, I run a playlist with a combination of selections from Mark Morgan's Fallout music, Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter, Wendy Carlos, and Brian Eno, with the few Inon Zur tracks I can tolerate.
---
I'm the guy that will try to revive you but also if you die imma take your shit.
---
Sinkin' putts and bustin' rhymes
---
He’s like “This is fine.”
---
I was going to
---
take over the workshops there defense is considered a event - doesn't matter who owns them just so long as you show up to shoot the like 15 enemies
---
Stash it
---
And eating your face!
---
Yeah for me I’m not going to go out of my way and do the challenge dailies with no reward to them. If they switched them to earn atoms once you completed the season I’d be more compelled to play
---
This sent me bruh hahahah 😂
---
Can’t stress this enough. The concurrent players statistic (which most games like to use because some games may be played for an hour and never touched again) relies entirely on a daily login, not how much time was spent playing. That is why they did the gold bullion limit, but it failed because a lot of players found it was too grindy to do it. 
---
Following this, they introduced the daily challenges with the season for the hopes people will at least log in to do a few a day, or even one to get the numbers up.
---
I'm lucky that i put a jetpack on a ultrucite leg before the patch. And the escavator torso and rest x-01. So i have a PA fot all things in one. Ecsvavator torso alone gives the 4x mining
---
If it's SBQ, I'll call for help sometimes. Encryptid, maybe. But usually to be on the safe side I always hit respawn right away and hope no one grabs my stuff.
---
Also, get the Paraptrooper Bag, it's harder to see. Less likely of someone seeing it and grabbing it.
---
Then that’s on you, homie. If you have stuff that you don’t want to lose, stash it immediately.
---
God, what ISN'T broken in this game??? inaccessible quests, non functional perks/stats displaying inproperly... HOW??? Has bethesda never heard of QA?
---
Thank you for the award this is my first one
---
Also to get players to buy the tiers they cant achieve through playing
---
I am so sorry that happened. I wonder if they realize how they made you feel?
---
Pfft, this dood.
---
You should be mad!! At yourself. Like, why are you running around with *any* flux and 6 hrs worth of plastic, whatever that equates to? Store that shit. And no I don't wanna hear you gripe about stash limits and how unfair "p2w" FO1st is. Manage your inventory better.
---
Hahah that's a great scene. Just another day in the wastes.
---
Yeah I don't get a chance to play during the weekdays so I cram all my playtime into the weekends. There's just always stuff to do.
---
I'm not entirely sold on that - given that there are times when it's obvious she isn't going to land (when she just hovers), so it should be perfectly fine to shoot the crap out of her.
---
The last three Queens I've found (and I believe you were there for at least one of them), have been shot right out of the air.
---
HP buffs hurt you when they are no longer active. This includes Well Fed, Buffout, Psychobuff, Herd Mentality, Strange in Numbers(if you have Herd Mentality), Lifegiver, All Rise, and any Endurance buff that doesn't come from armor. Rejuvenated has become infamous for it due to Captainoob, but it only magnifies the effect of Well Fed and doesn't have a direct effect in and of itself.
---
You can easily test this by equipping and unequipping Lifegiver or All Rise, or taking Rad-X then diluted Rad-X or joining and leaving teams if you have Herd Mentality. It's honestly amazing that something so easily tested is still not officially recognized as an issue by Bethesda and that so many don't fully understand when it's just so easy to test and prove.
---
Other games dont have the same reputation as fo76 though and have more end game content to keep people wanting to play everyday, problem with this one is you can do everything, then its months before theres anything new to do again
---
Yeah, few people. I like to solo Project Paradise and Radiation Rumble and complete them, at least to Tier 1 or keeping one animal alive. It's a reasonably fun endgame challenge and I usually get some legendaries out of it.
---
Why on earth did you not stash your flux the instant you got it? Dying will cause it to just disappear into the ether.  Also, stash your junk regularly, nobody should ever be running around with 6 hours worth.
---
I guess you've learnt the hard way.
---
Yup they are .. a trick is to leave the server before you die, you keep your junk if you don't mind leaving .. I do this a lot when a NPC takes me down in a area I don't want to lose my junk like a water logged tunnel.
---
Who the f is wandering around with 6 hours of flux farming in his pocket ?
---
The monorail pillars are used sometimes theres 1 with stairs going to the top
---
Early on in the game's release I was roaming Whitesprings and a team of 4 players in Golf Outfits and wielding Golf Clubs were running the fairways killing ghouls. They saw me looting some lunchboxes or whatever and stopped, then one guy got on his mic and said "Oy mate! Mind if we play through?", I just gave a thumbs up emote, "Cheers!", then they all ran past me looking for more stuff to kill.
---
Agreed - I put more stock on the folks standing on tents...I think fences, on the other hand, are fine.
---
The tents themselves don’t prevent her from landing, it’s rather or not she/the game brain farts in its attempted at pathing to her selected target. If the target is on the fance, bunker or tent, she can suffer from said brain fart.
---
"Sorry bud... i tried thought..."
---
I feel if more players took this attitude they’d have a lot more fun with the game.
---
....you don't drop junk in those events though?
---
Just realized I’m going to have to live with ‘Bash’ due to no VT melee skins. 🤮
---
I’ve just logged in for the first time in 2 weeks of not playing (vacation) to find myself only one step behind the bad guy, on the board. Apparently I built up enough of a lead before I left 2 weeks ago that I’m still in the race now.
---
Yeah this was pc. But I’ll honest I don’t remember
---
A little from column A, a little from column B.
---
I just do my weeklies and dailies and log off, don't have much time to do anything else. If I am really bored or have some extra time might do a quest, still haven't go thru the wastelands DLC as I am too focused on my dailies.
---
Thats not me because i was fighting a sheepsquatch and he ran in front of me.
---
It doesn't look finished, like it's missing some textures. And very chonky!
---
Why the fuck are you carrying 6 hours worth of flux around and not using passive mode? :D
---
I kind of like daily challenges, though I don't feel compelled to do it every day or to do all of them.
---
That I didn't try, but I don't think the magic stacks lol
---
With the buffs and events they've done for it there's already a decent bit of breathing room. I'm personally on track to finish almost a couple of weeks early even with missing/skipping some.  
---
They're planning to buff it again next season as well so if the requirements are the same it'll be even easier.
---
I got bloodied guass mini and its been melting things pretty nicely.  Making it prime isnt bad either in terms of ammo cost.  Not sure about the shotgun, working on getting it for my alt.
---
That’s the spirit!
---
[https://tenor.com/qRq7.gif](https://tenor.com/qRq7.gif)
---
I really enjoy doing the random events. Or fucking around. I also create my own little goals.
---
I was at that Queen last night right before i hopped off for the night.  I spent the vast majority of the fight standing there doing things on my computer because she wasn't landing and it seemed like there were plenty of people shooting her in the air.
---
We don't know for sure.  Im sure people being on tents and the fence doesn't help.  What i don't understand is why people feel the need to go on top of things at the queen fight.  Is your build so bad that you can't endure a couple scorched wacking on you so you need to hide?  It's probably a bit of both
---
Someone grabbed your junk?
---
that's fair.  Probably
---
Ok I get what you all are saying but like I lost a lot of plastic and flux and it just didn’t feel right I was going to my camp to stash it but I’m a bodied build and a scorched hit me and died and I was doing SBQ to get extra flux you can fill in the rest.
---
I can't ever find anyone selling 2 mm for a reasonable price.
---
I want to hang a brother.
---
Pretty much right. I like it because I'm always looking for a couple hours of brain dead entertainment daily. When I have nothing to do, TV gets old, I just want to sit and go numb for awhile. The content right now, while grindy, is something to do, and I kinda look forward to getting on in the evening.
---
I was literally about to stop playing for good, then I forgot to cancel my subscription so now it just feels like a waste not to play.
---
I enjoy doing it “non-glitched” and blasting “We Hold the Line Here” from the original Fallout 76 soundtrack.
---
Maybe...and yeah, I thought you looked a little bored.
---
I'd rather be right in her face, than standing on top of a tent.
---
It was after the SBQ
---
WHAT ALL A GONNA DO WITH THIS LAST BULLLLETT?
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Ok, so levels dont matter and soon hunger wont either? Nice.
---
Yes, and no solution other than rebooting and only running ‘76. But it’s more of a temporary solution...
---
Thank you. Even the under armor is ugly.
---
Tonight question, just kinda gotta catch me when I’m on lol but i mean usually.. around 6-11pm lol
---
How do you make your chicken last longer? Do you stroke it?
---
They mentioned this in yesterday's ITV as well.
---
There is an option. Don't use either
---
It's more of a choke.
---
Go to the gym If you’re needing extra activities. Not a slight, just an idea to add more things. I’ll get off work from the hospital, light a huge grav, then head to the gym for an hour.
---
That makes it so much worse lol there's usually +/- 3 survival tents in the immediate area, absolutely no reason why you couldn't unload your junk. Suck it up buttercup, this one's your fault.
---
Tents have a radius placement.  If you plonk your tent down, I then need to find a spot outside of your radius to place mine.
---
Let's take drop site v9, 1 tent placed near the fence isn't a problem - the Queen has ample space to land and engage.  The moment you get north of 3+ tents in that space, the landing zone for the queen is diminished significantly.
---
That isn't to say she won't then jump or scurry into the tent radius.  But she will land outside of it.  If you then factor into play the other locations within the area that she won't land - trees, crashed vertibird - it creates a significant amount of air time for the Queen.
---
What about bi-weekly challenges. 4 day challenges. Or even 3. Hell even 2 day. Let me take a break.
---
I agree. Or make the daily something simple, or something you have to do for weekly challenges. Though the latter would give those thay can play every day an advantage. 
---
I dont like when I see kill legendary enemies, since I rarely find those.
---
Wow what is your build like?
---
I try to put my tent down at least 100 paces away from V9... it causes a problem when you have four or five tents placed randomly surrounding V9. From my experience she likes to land around V9 outside the fence(where the tents usually are)
---
It has nothing to do with keeping you engaged lol
---
It has everything to do with us Investors who get reports on how many daily logins there are as a metric for how healthy a game is.
---
Well, yeah, my bad. I should've said that the time spent in the game per week should be around the same in total, if there was as much to do then as there is now if you add up all the daily content, and if you were able to do all of that content on any one of the days during that week, instead of having to log in every day.
---
Surely the total time spent in the game actually playing it per week is more important than simply the times people have done the login process. Right?
---
In any case, I personally can't find any way to defend a system that incentivises or "forces" us to log in every day, instead of just allowing us to decide when during that week we'd like - or are able, which is the case for many people - to play. As a player, there's nothing positive, that I can think of, about feeling like I have to log in every day.
---
I do feel like it is a huge negative though, as it's starting to burn me (anecdotal, of course, not speaking for anyone else) out, especially when thinking that this is how it's going to be from now - log in to play Fallout 76 for as long as it takes you to level up (which is the chore that is available every day, gives the most S.C.O.R.E., and aside from getting an Overseer level, takes the most time), *every single day*, for as long as you remain a Fallout 76 player.
---
Maybe I'm just missing something here.
---
Hell yeah, crazy antics are a part of Fallout. I have the plans to craft the Halloween skeleton mask and costume so sometimes I make a bunch and drop them for everyone I see. I had 5 noobies all dressed as skeletons outside the Wayward once, it was glorious.
---
Correction. The best fallout moments is when you're murdering.
---
Ah stash limits, aren't they great?
---
Commando bloodied and unyielding. I just found out a friend of mine can hit 700 max with all the chems food
---
Make an alt problem solved
---
You can tell when it’s because she’s being shot in the air, when she starts her landing animation.... kind of looks like she’s getting ready to swan dive and then she gets shot...she doesn’t land. When she’s hovering I always assumed it was OK to shoot her. I run shotguns and a cryo when she lands so I’m never shooting her in the air anyways. You’ll see me either running crowd control or jumping around like a madman out in the open trying to get her to target me to land
---
I heard that it acts as a vaccine for the coronavirus...
---
I love finding stuff like that. So far, I only have two.

keep dailys but have them give out gold and other items with a weekly challenge to do X number of dailys - this will get people logging in but also give daily players a bit of a boost on characters 
---
double the weekly challenges 
---
add seasonal challenges 
---
this will let us on weeks we have time do lots of things and keep us moving but on weeks we have real life (since you know... most of us are adults....) we can focus on weekly and seasonal challenges
---
It aids stealth players to stay hidden and climb aboard a tent.
---
For others? Minimum risk and effort, maximum reward I suspect.
---
1.i was going to a tent
---
2. Scorched comes out of nowhere
---
I get it and it was my fault but can you see where I’m coming from
---
You know how much of a hassle it is transferring back and forth.  Also, that's not solving the problem, eventually they will get filled up too.
---
Not really I do it all the time
---
Ever since the patch I've been crashing multiple times each player session. Events, fast traveling, nuclear, etc., if you can do it in the game you can crash during it. I lost a bunch of scrip last night because of a server crashing as well which seems to be much more common now as well. Funny how it saves my character dropping items but not picking them up. The trade system is so unreliable that trading between my two accounts also won't work half the time.
---
I actually laughed out loud
---
Fish in a barrel...Line in the Sand will give me so much XP I level up twice (I'm lvl 417) in one event.
---
Never experienced it,as I was late to the game...
---
But it sounds dope.
---
So, I might see **Mark V Liberators** just outside of Vault 76?  
---
Dang.
---
Soon as I finished season 1 I was so happy, happy that I didn't need to keep committing so much time to one game. Haven't touched fo76 since Tuesday. If season 2 is the same I'll just leave it on a backburner until more updates roll on in.
---
What does bloodied and unyielding add to the carry capacity?
---
You have to put stuff in a public container, hope no one looks it, get on with your other character, try to join the same server, and then take it.  Realize you need something 5 minutes later and transfer it back.
---
True, but if I’m at 1 hp I’m more likely to die if a random mole rat attacks me and I don’t have a chance to react (I still pay some attention, just not actively playing) not that dying is a big deal
---
Nothing, you can stay log off.
---
lol thank Todd it doesn’t stack or the queen will refuse to crawl out of the fissures
---
Until One Wasteland comes out, the forest (left) side of the map is easier, right side is harder. Work it in that way, is really the best way i can describe to you.
---
Ah, I see!  Wolves probably won't work unless I can find a solo one somewhere. Thanks for the tip!
---
I play a stealth commando, I know for a fact it works. It doesn't always say sneak damage, but vs the queen, my damage is way lower when im in danger vs caution.
---
This was the place to be and now it’s dead.
---
I've often wished for this as well. I got to Whitesprings to dump caps on PA plans when I get near the cap and scrap stuff often and it's always so empty.
---
Perk cards don’t work on stash.
---
This was a Mistake sorry for complaining and sorry for wasting your time
---
Guaranteed legendary drop, lots of robots, and chance at Fixer Plan, which now a days doesn't go for much more than 5-6k but it's still something.
---
I had the same issue at first. For me, it was the fact I installed the game onto my other hard drive instead of the main one my OS was on. Once I reinstalled the game on my main hard drive, it worked fine. No clue why it does that though.
---
Blocking completion and preventing progression? Phew.. I was worried it was doing something *REALLY* bad like allowing you to buy gold bullion more than once per week or something. At least they have their priorities right when it comes to dropping hotfixes!
---
I mean, they supposedly fixed a lot of things in Patch 21. Instead they broke said things more than fix it.
---
How they haven't hotfixed Ounce of Prevention is beyond me, they make us grind for Gold Bullion as end game, but can't even reach it.. I have missed out on a stupid amount of gold already since the patch.
---
I am fully expecting some Gold Bullion at the end, then again... It is bethesda and it just works as intended.
---
Getting there.  I probably won’t use atoms.  Im about 4-5 spaces ahead of him but in no rush.  Just doing the weekly/dailies no NW
---
You stated that you lost 6 hours worth of flux which is  36 SBQ events, if each one takes 10 mins. You are either full of shit or just plain stupid, or both.
---
Melee on my main for 600+ levels.  I like melee a lot but Queen fights can be a drag.  Don't really want to change my build as I have 4 alts all with builds and identities and I don't want to have 2 heavy gunners or like 2 commandos.  Idk.  Maybe I will switch it up.
---
Idk how rare this is but I got insulted by a 3 star legendary insult bot.  I’ve only seen one in since the beta
---
I tried an instigating LMG and it didn’t work. Worked with my I/FFR mini gun
---
About the same here. Only 2 rolls a day is feasible(I'm sure the math nerds are queuing up to correct me since it's technically 2.0000100035 or something 😆), so I find myself just rolling for 1 weapon and getting both a module and the 5 vault steel daily. It really doesn't seem worth the extra effort.
---
Yeah I used vats and that worked perfectly
---
It's back in my stash now!!! What the heck??? Lol thank God that had me scared haha
---
I'm having a lot more fun on my level 145 now - my 538 has been on the sidelines, just using her to get bullion (still have something like 1100 notes) and for messing around.
---
Yep. Last night. Locked PC so hard, had to reboot.
---
Unyielding gives 3 max strength. And with bloodied I’m required to keep low health
---
Well, at the rate that vault dwellers are dropping nukes, can you really blame them? 
---
I bet their thoughts during that scene were "A nuke this early in the morning? Usually they wait until lunch or early afternoon before the nukes start dropping. I guess there are some early birds today. Anyways, I wonder what Grahm has for sale today..."
---
I been saying this for the longest! Let  us either "salt" our meats or can/jar our fruits and veggies. Its very conceivable that people in the wasteland would find ways to address food spoilage, they already have the mechanics in place to achieve this i mean...why not? Also wouldnt mind "meal packs" that have charges you can eat from a certain amount of times. If i go through the trouble of making a schoarchmeat stew pack i mean....thats alot of food dude lemmee get three meals out of it.
---
Or if Sunny finally has ice cream now that he’s got that new fridge.

Just go ask Sunny, sheesh.
---
Yeesh, relax guy. You dont have to stomp back and forth *not caring* as hard as you can.
---
Any news on the reflections bug on amd cards?
---
Come on, it's not that bad, is it?
---
No fast travel is going to make it really suck IMO. I'd go with Train stations only BUT you have to be at a train station in order to go to another train station (keeping with your handcart theory you mentioned in another comment). That would limit your travel, but give you the train stations as points.
---
Unless you're dead set on VT paint schemes, I would open that up to leather and combat armor, since that's stuff you'd actually be able to find that would be useful. But require that you keep at least one piece of VT scheme gear at all times and/or always have to wear the VT undergarment. That way you show your pride but aren't limiting yourself too much.
---
I think Herbivore and adrenal reaction are solid ideas honestly.
---
I would put some restrictions on your camp, like forcing yourself to use the various tents (which you could "find" from an RP perspective), the basic crafting benches (or at least the cooking pot), a bed, etc and force it to be blueprint-able and you move it with you as you go. No fast traveling back to it. You pack up when you head out, and set up camp again when you're done (unless you set it up outside of a town and go in and come back out as an excursion scenario). Treat it like an actual camp that you carry around.
---
it's two different things. sometimes you get the sneak multiplier even if the message doesn't show.
---
what I'm talking about though, is that the sneak multiplier flat out doesn't work if your target is in combat.
---
I'm also a sneak commando and have had this happen multiple times. I can post video proof if you want but someone else said turtle already covered this.
---
Maybe post what your build is right now and someone can help you tweak it.
---
When I started my character was built on quality if life, crafting, and semi auto rifles. Ended up a really poor build, everything was a bullet sponge for me, especially since my primary weapon was a basic handmade rifle modded for lesser recoil and damage.
---
 If you need a resource to help you plan out what you want to do with your build, https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks, helped me a ton. It let's you set up perk cards, legendary mods on weapons and armor, mutations, and even addictions. If you want to have someone help you with your build, copy the url and share your build.
---
I hope this info can help you out. Still a shame I can't help you out with some gear though. Oh well, maybe they will crossplat this in some way eventually.
---
The one you should get done before One Wasteland is the Kill Robots with no weapons equipped challenge. That requires your fists and I doubt anybody at Bethesda remembers it even exists.
---
Just cook some corn soup and you will be fine ...
---
Haha me too!
---
okay Karen
---
Because its fallout76.. Its enjoyable..
---
"Confirmed?" Only has much as they say they've been working on it, it's hard &amp; they don't know when it will be supported or how.
---
No, everything was running smooth. Probably because there were only a handful of people on the server at the time
---
I'm pretty sure I got most of my mods for Raider Armor Mods, by scrapping raider armor. You can also find mods out in the world (not plan but actual mod). Maybe I bought some plans from vendors, but I'm fairly certain I got most from scrapping. It's been so long now lol.
---
The dailies are pretty easy and can be finished within an hour typically. If you are asking for more difficult/larger pool weekly challenges, chances are they will be something like "complete X amount of events", "claim 20 workshops", "Level up 10 times", etc... This is something I DO NOT want as it requires more time to complete.
---
Where is everyone hanging out now?
---
Ugh, this community is so toxic!
---
oh ok so its all good then. normally i don't attack other players unless they attack my camp or just don't stop attacking me. prefer to use my time and ammo on the sheepy's like you were fighting
---
If it doesn't happen immediately, it is *literally* a slap in the face to the fo76 community!
---
Definitely more crashes since the latest patch - at least once/gaming session.  Also noticed that the "disappearing corpse syndrome" has gotten worse.  Been trying for the past week and a half to get one last Bloatfly Gland for a Syringer update.  Two dozen+ dead Bloatflies  but only one corpse that didn't disappear . . . and that one only had meat.  Last weekend, doing "Thrill of the Grill" quest, shot up a herd of six Radstags . . . only two corpses.  Sucktacular.
---
Mod support as in Bethesda approved mods. Not user made mods.
---
One rumored work around is to not join a team and server hop until the Q is doable :/
---
Wait , are the legendary perk out?
---
step 3 is obviously a tea party with said pirates. The warning is more about death if they bring in their dirty shoes.
---
My Instigating LMG works, but not as good as my Jffr LMG. It's also hard to keep shooting the same body part with LMG's, due to the recoil. Having it around 200 definitely makes it easier/better though.
---
Do any NPC mobs attack it?
---
And there is prolly some from column C and column D we just haven't identified them yet.  But it never hurts to take extra steps to help out(Masks)!  Do you know if there is a way to pick up your tent without placing it elsewhere?
---
Pro tip: You can place neon blue letters on the cage itself. I labeled my skeleton as Ward and put a displace case fill with 3 portable power packs and an osmosis kit below him.
---
I’m nearing level 190. I use an almost complete vanguard set of armor. I’m just now getting into modding power suits. Can’t find anything better than Excavator, in spite having all but the X01 in various incomplete forms.
---
I just discovered the warrens? I think that’s the name.
---
I couldn’t beat it right away. I got through the maze but ran out of supplies before moving on to the next part.
---
Suffice to say, even though I’m done with 90% or more of the content, I still am not the god that you become in Skyrim or FO4.
---
I pretty much ditched armor on my stealth characters for the Stealth Suit. It is just too good no too. Unless you are running a bloodied build with unyielding, it is really hard to give up pretty much permanent sneak and permanent sneak damage multipliers.
---
The only thing I need for my sniper is to replace my AA Lever Action with an Instigating Fixer.
---
F1st is not available in all countries, so ya that could be it.
---
But I have no clue how to check which region your PS4 claims to be in, let alone how to change it.
---
30 points. The final rank goes from +3 to +5. 
---
Otherwise, seems right. What’s the point of the legendary perks system if half the player base has already unlocked max on all 6. I want to feel like I have something to work towards again in my base stats. So what if it takes me a year? Clearly the complaints are coming from non-MMO players, because I remember mindlessly cutting trees for months for a stupid woodcutting cape. Surely playing the fame however you want to earn lvls for these cards isn’t such a struggle...
---
You can romance both, but isn't the Lover's Embrace perk identical to Kindred Spirit?
---
Same here! We already have the brahmin pen for fertilizer, not to mention any food that spoils, so a coop for more fertilizer isn't really necessary! I wanted eggs, or at least the option to have a chicken dinner every now and then!
---
(You start a new toon, run them to flatwoods, and they're good for 2 levelups easy just doing volunteer training. You don't even need to pick up anything getting outta the vault)
---
Yes please.  I need my life back.
---
I'm thinking we're going to see something like this, akin to the Creation Club rather than us being able to mod the shit out of the game like we'd do with 4.
---
Well I’m using singapore as my region since everything is cheaper there. But I’m from uk. And I encounter asians with f1st
---
wow, what a badass you are. reported.
---
Private servers
---
I have absolutely no idea
---
And yet here you are lurking in the subreddit
---
Just need some bailey's and an old shoe....
---
Just looked up that weapon, how does one come about finding an Instigating Fixer? Just RNGesus or can you exchange scrip for it somewhere?
---
I don't understand how you could be burnt out from it either.  I finished over 2 weeks ago and I was just like "gimme that next season now!!!".  It's free stuff for taking a few minutes everyday to complete challenges.  It's amazing.
---
You are right that if folks are in fact being burnt out it is their own fault for not going at the right pace.  We are still going to have double score weekends and a few weeks of challenges.  If people think this battle pass is a grind go do the Call of duty one to 100 and tell me which one takes more play-time.  That is a real grind.
---
I’m on the opposite side, if this was a single player game, then there is less reason (and less leverage) for you NOT specializing. You have no one else to rely on to fill the gaps in your characters.  Here you have hundreds of players. 
---
And sure, games allow you to do some respecilization, but in something like World of Warcraft, you might be able to respec from Shadow Priest to a Holy priest, but you’re still ultimately a priest. You won’t be tanking for any group.  We already have more flexibility than in games such as that. 
---
And we are getting more into other design issues when we talk about the current state of the game. I don’t believe the current state of the game to be in a good place because of the reasons your giving. \*Hopefully\* some of these legendary perks can start encouraging some different play styles.  We have perks encouraging players to “tank” in how they make attackers take more damage, and with the perk that gives you a chem that fills all our bars the support player may be more likely to take perks that let them share their healing and food/drink consumption with the group.  
---
Also, don’t forget that these perks are shared across all characters you have, so getting a +5 INT perk will make leveling your alts faster, and the excess cards they earn can be turned also into more points.  
---
I don’t think this system punishes people for making mistakes, if you have thousands of hours in your character, you should know what you want for your character (not that you even need that extra power).  And I’ll admit, i don’t think people SHOULD be able to just change their minds that easily.  If you built your character as a bloodied stealth commando I DON’T think you should just be able to snap your fingers and suddenly play a Heavy Weapon Power Armor tank. THat’s what the other character slots are for, and people who can switch that easily end up not knowing how to play that character and can end up messing up events.
---
Whaaaaaaat seriously?? I had no idea...that's a huge bummer. But I guess it makes sense since if you removed the cards it would probably make the stash glitch out or something.
---
No no. Can we get a vendor where Mrumururh used to rip people off. I keep forgetting that railway station doesn’t have one!
---
Yeah but there’s a problem if watching X-Files reruns while doing dishes is a more fun activity than playing.
---
Did it work?
---
Let’s get both!!!
---
I leave behind a "you have been insulted" note and one single tato.
---
The message of the note is pretty clear. But the tato will drive them to insanity.
---
What does it mean? Should he eat it? Is it maybe poisoned? Is it a fruit or a vegetable?! Will i appear on his porch one night covered in tato juice taking my final revenge?
---
Who knows? Sleep well my friend...
---
Its possible its near the train yard but it may be far enough away. I never personally set up there.
---
To get legendary fixers you need to get the plan from Encryptid, then they’ll start dropping in the loot pools and from murmur
---
I mean, I can certainly park my tent near Whitesprings. I’ve been keeping it near ATLUS for the time being.
---
I use a combination of these effects on different pieces. Combined with high Agility and Sneaky perks, I can sneak just about anywhere. But my legendary armor pieces also include all sorts of other effects that I would not be getting with the Chinese Stealth set, so that is why I like my approach.
---
I have not tried multiple chameleon effects - I only have it on one piece. My assumption in that choice was that there would be no benefit to multiple chameleon items, but I don’t actually know that is the case.
---
Edit: I should add - I get waterborne disease protection with a marine wetsuit underarmor. The only Chinese stealth benefit I am missing with my setup is the rad protection. I generally switch to PA if I am going into a nuke zone or running Radiation Rumble, etc.
---
No not a problem really, have you tried going to Event locations? Like the Grafton or the airport?
---
It will make Leveling easier though
---
Good point I heard last night - BGS has invested substantial funds into Fallout 76 &amp; the multiplayer technology.
---
They'll continue to use Fallout 76 to test out new tech for future games. I believe it will continue for quite some time.
---
I ran 3 AWOLs back to back last night. Public, private, public. Nothing else was coming up like uranium though and I was on for a few hours.
---
God can you imagine if it was that big? I'd much prefer it 😁
---
It’s not over that quick most times on Xbox. Last night finally joined a server while the fight was happening. As every other night I join and nukes already where there and fight over. Well I get down there and only a couple ppl there mostly level 20s that fight took until the very last minute where she wouldn’t land and I had to use magic mini to finish because I didn’t wanna waste all that ammo to get nothing.
---
Damn. I tried that quest once by myself. Funny enough, my sneak was so high that the Assaultron couldn’t see me. I just couldn’t use the pylons on my own without it killing me, and I couldn’t cause damage fast enough to kill it with the shields up...Ended up failing that quest.
---
What, and jumping 20ft into the air with bird bones and then raining hell down on the earth with an explosive energy weapon doesn’t?
---
Bought the plans last night for 2500, first plan for it I have seen since January (XBox)
---
We don't *need* anything at all from this game.  I didn't *need* to buy all the serum recipes and PA plans.  I don't *need* any of the remaining mods for my SS armour.  I certainly didn't *need* to server-hop until I got all the civil war plans and rare clothing from the responderbot.  I don't even *need* to keep trying to get better armour and weapons, because I'm already capable of doing any encounter in the game and have been for a long, long, *looong* time.
---
But once you've done all the missions and events... those are the things that are left to do.  I can put the game down and walk away, or I can hope that they improve these things.  I have to wonder what the reasoning is for someone who would argue *against* improving things.
---
Personally way I think to do it is do only weeklies / a monthly but leave every weekly up for the duration of the pass, so every week say 5-10 new weeklies come out but the previous ones stay there if you missed them.
---
I’d prefer they made score xp based instead of from daily / weeklies so you can get as much or as little as you want by just playing the game
---
Try changing it to UK?
---
between chameleon and unyielding, the sneakiest is chameleon. with a full set, you're undetectable. the downside being that you can't move, but this can be mitigated, somewhat, with shadowed and muffled mods.
---
but a full unyielding set is no slouch thanks to the +15 agility. it allows you to reposition more safely, too. and thanks to escape artist you'll be back to caution just as easily. the difference is that you can't whack things indefinitely and not get found, unlike chameleon.
---
speaking of mods, shadowed helps your ability to stay hidden by a considerably margin. it works outside during daylight, too. muffled supposedly helps you stay hidden while moving but I don't think anyone can confirm it at this point.
---
the CSS is pretty good but its invisibility is not as good as a full chameleon set. chameleon does stack, by the way. as do shadowed pieces. the HTD legendary (harder to detect while sneaking) doesn't stack. don't know about muffled.
---
76 is a vault tec experiment
---
In my personal experience, lower level, if you are hurting for caps, is run Blackwater Mine, kill all mole miners, loot everything. Doesn't matter that you get over encumbered, as the vendor is just outside. If that didn't hit your 1,400 cap threshold, which is should be quite close, jump servers and go again. Takes about 10 minutes, and you're done for the day.
---
Other than that, play the game, accumulate junk. I have over 1,240 Stimpaks just from playing. I can't sell them fast enough, I get them faster than I can sell for my daily cap.
---
You can try selling ammo. Run lucky hole mines, daily, with Excavator PA, for lots of Lead Ore, smelt it into Lead Scrap, and make LOTS of ammo with Ammo Smith and Super Duper perks. (.45 or 5.55 seem to be the most popular) Some people still buy ammo from vendors for 1cap per bullet. But you can also buy 1bullet for .5caps on Discord servers.
---
When you get higher level, you will find that the trouble is not making caps but having to try and spend caps so you are not constantly sitting at 30k. I find myself going to Vendor Train Stations and buying Bulk Concrete just to spend caps.
---
I have a friend who payed for the premium version of that pass and only played that game for a couple of months. He seemed to enjoy it so I guess it was worth it, but I missed him for that time.
---
Well that’s kinda a weird scenario and not at all representative of the usual turnout so.... while I acknowledge that anomalies happen, I don’t usually include them in my hypotheticals. IF it was me and a much of level 20s I’d get off the roof. Is that what you wanted to hear or...
---
Agreed. They've added a ton of wiggle room since the season launched, too; two extra Dailies per day, double Daily and double XP weekends, plus another double daily and an extra week for the Project ATLAS event. The season is entirely reasonable, at this point they just need to iron out the autocomplete bugs and season 2 will be rock solid. I know FOMO is a powerful force, and live service games like to capitalize on that, but how much someone engages is entirely on them. If you don't want a game to feel like a job, stop putting in 40 hours a week!
---
As for reasons to do challenges after completing the season, IMO a good idea would be to have weekly Atom challenges based on how many Gold Star dailies you complete. That could even just be implemented from the start of the season, and replace the ten 150 Atom rewards on the SCORE board for the same net result.
---
Why do you farm the queen so much? I dont get it... Line in The Sand, Rad Rumble gives much more XP, is it for the legendary? Its an ammo waste!
---
It's hard to quantify. But there are playstyle considerations, since wood allows you to sneak around faster, per piece. Shadowed doesnt stack but it adds so a leather piece is good. Leather legs in particular can be both muffled and shadowed so you might not lose anything from wood if you switch the legs to leather. 
---
Shadowed doesnt seem to work on any other kind of armour. Wood doesnt so mods except for the sneaky one, so if you need or want scoped for arms you might want something else.
---
Weightless stackswith the mutation but chameleon legendary effect doesnt.
---
Edit: you give up on unyielding obviously if you go CSS, which would pump up you agility and perception to help with sneak and range. Even +agi pieces would help. One sneak piece is useful but not more unless you're in the habit of switching them out and need versatility.
---
I ve hit lvl 200 not long ago and im still having fun. Currently trying my hardest to make the best camp possible.
---
&gt;hopefully at some point one of the Bethesda devs will play the game
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!  Love it.
---
I play a few hours everyday after work. Right now I’m working on completing the main quests. Just finished wastelanders last night and picked up on some BoS quest line. 
---
Whenever I get that done, I’ll probably keep doing side/daily/event quests, stock up on junk like a pack rat and make my camp actually decent.
---
Well said!  Have some will-power people
---
Relatedly: I’m glad that 76 doesn’t force an identity on you other than vault dweller human.
---
Winners never guit!
---
On rank 93 I'm ready to finish....
---
I only have it to play with friends.  I never end up finishing the COD pass and end up buying tiers in the sale at the end because I don't have enough time to grind it while playing other games along with real life.
---
Edit: You know what I don't do?  Go to the COD sub and complain about how much of a grind it is lol.
---
I was on ground the whole time. So I don’t know what you’re trying to say. But I never stand on roof I’m a stealth commando so I have no problem being on the ground fighting the mobs. Gotta love reddit
---
It’s a skin for the backpack.
---
Oh sorry I thought you were the person I was responding to before.
---
Cap the score XP at 1500 per level.
---
I've been waiting for One Violent Night for a week or two now. I got bored and finally started doing the Possum quests, and I need that for the Musician one. I've hung around the area at around dusk for an hour or two, and it just never appears.
---
Craft a standard backpack, than mod it to the Demonic skin.
---
They changed the process slightly from the way it used to be, now you just mod the standard vs craft a custom skinned backpack.
---
especially if they use a torch to fix a wood post.
---
You aren't the boss of me.  I can complain about anything I want.  It's reddit.
---
;)
---
I haven't done a regular mission in weeks 😭
---
With a group of really well geared players, and not standing on a tent or in a tree, she lands almost immediately, and we kill her very quickly. Lots of XP just from the Queen, bunch of Flux, Improved Repair Kits, XP and loot from all the mobs that spawn during that event, and at the same time, it helps lower level players who may not be able to run a silo, solo and quickly.
---
The amount of Ammo I spend is not a lot lol. What else am I going to use ammo for? Out in the world, I use a slow Firing Gatling Gun, that hits like a truck, so ammo is a non-issue. And you can easily get 700-1000 of whatever rounds you want, if you do Lucky Hole Mines every day, with your Excavator Power Armor.
---
I think it's another "imponderable" like how long a disease will last, how long a Bobblehead effect will last, etc.  I find that even with "Good With Salt" installed, the same type of item changes time 'til spoilage from gaming session to gaming session.  Almost makes me think the "timer" for these features doesn't run at a consistent rate.
---
In the Whitesprings you can find all faction's vendors
---
There are VT paint for leather, metal and combat armors, so I should be good to go til PA opens another option. Train station fast travel will be station to station... thinking about it, I may have that as my only FT option since the logic makes sense. No FT to camps or tents (maybe).
---
CAMPs : built around pre-existing structures or pre-fabs (if location appropriate, train car near track, red rocket near road, seedy shack or log cabin fairly open to location, but off the beaten path). Tents always a CAMP option as well. Survival tent is good to go.
---
As a fixed to not being able to place blueprints. Perhaps it’s just an overlay, but you still have to build each piece individually? That way you can put it together as the resources become available. 
---
Plus, as a builder, I hate having to use a mule just to try out building ideas. I put way too much work into the camps I create to tear them down unless I know my next idea works. It would be nice if I could keep them saved better so that I can replace an old design that I liked more
---
I don't think there is one absolute number, even for that. With at least a dozen variables that effect the bottom line, you'll have to experiment to learn/find the cutoff for your normal loadout.  
---
  The dozen variables mentioned are: strength, whether armor and/or mutations provide for more strength, whether your armor is pocketed or deep pocketed, and if you have a backpack or a high capacity backpack.....
---
Changing to PA lowers carry weight (as you lose you pockets, the backpack, and +specials armor may provide)
---
  Then you have food and chems for temporary boosts.  
---
Found out last weekend teammates sharing certain perks also affects carry weight - I went at least 30# over one of my known cutoffs, but wasn't affected.  When I commented on it, one of my teammates said he was shared a perk that boosted my carry weight by a good margin  (He told me which perk, but I forget)
---
Nothing gets in the way of my coffee.... NOTHING.
---
Dang, you got me there.
---
I would love that. I stopped playing altogether for nor because the daily challenges felt like a drag.
---
Mod support was confirmed when it was in BETA. They just let us know they are still working on it. And the mods will not be like Fo4 or Skyrim. It will have to be approved like Creation Club, (Wouldn't surprise me if they charge for them too)
---
Been dealing with it more often since the update. Hopefully it gets fixed.
---
It's kind of sad that the nukes don't actually destroy anything, though it makes sense. It's mostly just a rad bomb.
---
Same. My time is limited. If it were possible for me to at least catch up during my off time I’d put more effort in, but with the system the way it is I know I won’t be able to complete the grind so I don’t even bother.
---
You mean fallout76’s community is better than the community of those games right? Surely the quality of the game has nothing to do with how good or bad the community is.
---
Creation Club 2.0
---
*what have you done*
---
So would it be worth getting the chameleon mutation with the Chinese stealth suit if chameleon actually stacks?
---
Yes! Someone finally gets what a live-service games means! They're SUPPOSED to keep adding to the game. Perks, weapon types, etc, these things are NOT supposed to be static! The fact that this game has been out for almost 2 years now and we've only had 1 change in the meta very earlier on is very saddening.
---
I plipt the the table and Liv in my  sons basement playing video games all day
---
There are actually 2 stealth related legendary perks, chameleon and the 3rd star perk that states "become harder to detect while sneaking. I don't think there is any benefit to 2 prices with chameleon, but I could be wrong.
---
My suggestion would be, if you are running a bloodied low health build, get either 5 peices of unyielding with become harder to detect while sneaking, or 4 of those pieces and a chameleon with harder to detect while sneaking, the prices might be steep, but that would be a very good option. The reason I mention unyielding is because you get +3 agility per piece you have equipped while at low health, and agility decreases how easily you are detected.
---
If you are running a full life build, weightless might be an option, with the same 3rd star perk and the chameleon mutation. You could also get the mod for power armor chest pieces that gives you limited invisibility, stealth boy I thinking is.
---
In the case of any of these, the fixer with a silencer is a definite pro, since it is literally made for this type of build.
---
I will say the stealth suit is a good poor mans option, I've been running it a lot of my bloodied build, it does a great job really, but there are better long term options IMO.
---
“gas industry”
---
Ive gotten chem recipes from mirrors and in the white springs bunker. For farming i put on pharma pharm 3 and hit morgan town air port and the asylum.
---
I mean it's a label on a old lamp design. Not a lot of cost there
---
Also get a bunch from the event at sons of dane compound
---
Yeah, but it would suck if you were trying to complete a quest and had to wait for Foundation to return to normal.
---
I'll check out the video, when I was referring to the SBQ, you said when other players are around you don't get the stealth damage, I just fought her after your post and it worked fine for me, a dozen other players and I was definitely getting the stealth multi. (I know because if I stand up and shoot her my damage drops off significantly) Is this something that could be related to other factors? First I've heard of it. But interested to know more.
---
\*EDIT\* You said its happened multiple times, does this mean it doesn't always happen and some other factor is affecting it, which is why I perhaps haven't had it happen? Is it just a VATS thing? Does it happen with manual aim too?
---
Why do we have to discard Perk cards to get the coins, that is so stupid. Just give us some points for levels and use them toward these legendary perks. Ever little aspect of this game doesn't have to be a mini game. I love this game but almost everything they do is so god damn annoying.
---
Aug 20-24, I think, but I can't get to bethesdas site right now to verify.
---
Enclave bunker medical wing or 1 of the travelling merchants sells the plans. Some events also reward them but not common. Farming i cant help you on.
---
https://youtu.be/txLSunojrOY - pretty much sums it all up.
---
I have some decency, I punched them to mortality
---
&gt;Agreed. They've added a ton of wiggle room since the season launched, too
---
I think this is an important fact to acknowledge, though.  If you were going by the original numbers, the truth was that you did need to hit that Repeatable XP goal something like 150 times, on top of completing every single Daily and Weekly.
---
By the time Bethesda had added more Dailies, and at least one more of these bonus SCORE events (possibly two if we meet the Atlas goals), I was already somewhere around Rank 60.
---
So yeah, it's easy to look back and sneer at those who grinded the event faster, but you have the benefit of knowing what we know now.
---
Order of the Clucks.
---
 "But I love chickens, Eddy!"
---
It really seems to be server-dependent. Sometimes I log in and go for an hour with scarcely an event, then other times it back to back to back with public events.
---
If all else fails, join another server.
---
Raider Collectron brings Chems home for ya! Also threatens to burn down your Camp, but hey ho! HeHe.
---
Run! I hear banjo music!
---
The strangler heart PA allows you to apply ultracite skins and still keep the acid buff. Being able to do a similar thing to the solar/thorn armor would be nice for people who like the health/stealth buffs but don't necissarily like the look of the armor...
---
go for it
---
Thx

I managed to get past it by hopping servers and immediately using the terminal to fire up the centrifuge. Don't put the fuse in until the centrifuge works.
---
I was hoping for a refreshable supply of chicken meat myself. As it is, at least it's extra background chatter for my CAMP, to break up the monotony of my vendorbots' singing.
---
Occasionally there is a "pharmacist" ghoul, they drop a suprising amount. And the raider collection, you get a lot of booze and junk also, but its automated, you just empty it once in awhile.
---
I'd say it's been up quite a bit since the last major patch.  I fully expect it to crash every couple hours or so.  Doesn't seem to be any real pattern to it.  It could happen during a loading screen, or it could happen as I'm just walking down the road.
---
Yes, it was much more fun fighting super muties in that area.
---
Honestly i don’t feel like it’s much of a ‘grind’ like many have complained. It’s a virtual theme park that I enjoy spending time in. I haven’t even done all the events yet (dogwood die off?) If people hate to play it, why would they want the god roll legendaries then? So they can stop playing for good after acquiring them? I’m not sure what the logic is.
---
oh please share! :-)
---
I understand why you're against it and I personally disagree with his choice but what I'm saying is I understand why he made it.
---
You can love a game but hate a certain aspect.
---
You do if the events ends when you're downed.
---
Keep an eye out for good Adventure Mode servers, where people are running Scorched Earth and whatnot. If you have enough high level players on the server running those events, Encryptid is more likely to be successful. Fixer plans are not a common drop though - I got them after something like 15 successful Encryptid events.
---
Xbox, some days have been rough. Some are location specific, like trying to enter the Whitespring bunker. Server disconnects too, happened twice when I was trying to do the NW challenge yesterday.
---
Also my 50 Hornwright key cards that can't be removed.
---
I agree but adding cheap tricks to keep people coming is only making that situation worse.
---
I'm not saying there is an easy fix for everything as a hole. I just offered a reasonable compromise.
---
I respectfully disagree
---
Farming materials to make bullets 
---
Or treasury notes 
---
Or legendary stuff to sell
---
Those daily challenges are what ruined this game for me. I did not buy a board game I brought fallout but my free time I have to play this game is spent grinding a board game because they now have everything locked behind it
---
Ah ok.  And do you have full strength points plus all the weight perk cards and deep pocketed?  Just trying to get the most out of mine but I recently had to take a lot if points out of strength to work on my build and put it in agility and luck :(
---
Also lightsabers everywhere.
---
It's like whoever is in charge of designing armor now has a real infatuation with chunky designs.
---
And it doesn't complement anything.  You know, you can sort of mix-and-match Metal Armor, Leather Armor, Combat Armor, and Scout Armor, and as long as you keep it symmetrical, it doesn't look too bad.  But nothing goes with Secret Service armor, least of all the gray color they use for it.
---
I'm still on the first length of rewards and don't even really care. I just play to have fun and I'll take what I can get.
---
Could do like apex. U have like 4 dailies a day and if u do like 5 you automatically get a battle pass level and then u get another after like 10. Then you get a set xp for them. As well as weekly challenges. Where like 3 give u levels but there grindy af then the rest give u xp.
---
Another post complaining about people complaining...
---
The majority of my chems come from Ghouls.  You will occasionally kill one and find things like: 2 buffout, 2 psycho, 2 calmex, typically a total of 6 chems.  
---
Golf Course, Fort Defiance, and the Burrows are 3 great sources of ghouls.
---
Just throw them at random enemies when you need the space 
---
aka overkill

Because I just like it. Ez.

I am a GW2 player that just bought F76. I do not recommend. GW2 is a waaay superior game. Story, graphics, pvp, events, voice acting, NPC's, trading, coop, interface, stability - everything is better in GW2.
---
My instabuys: cryo cells at 1c, fusion cores at 1c/charge point or less, raw rubber/plastic/leather at 1c or bulk amounts of these at a discount from listed price (I've bought 3k of each at a time before), grape mentats at reasonable price.
---
I just use them. The AoE is bigger than the actual visual effect would imply, and they are actually kind of interesting.  At least I can do something with them... unlike the camera
---
I haven’t even seen a normal chicken yet
---
There is no event to do. Go to activate riding shotgun. Just in that moment, start radiation rumble.. ok
---
Even now when I see that I have to kill ten Scorched, I go to the fissures near Prime and add in the Scorchbeast xp while I’m at it.  One Wasteland will be a net gain for me.  
---
I cannot understand why a high level player would opt to crush some low level tomato cans when they should be able to easily fight max level enemies.
---
Well, one COULD activate Poseiden and run the workshop power boxes connected to it and put 5 in each connected workshop. But I am getting plenty of ammo the way I am doing it. As for the server crashing to steal score levels, no I may be bad, but I'm not a total douchebag.
---
I can't give this enough upvotes
---
Ammo and junk is what will move the best. Once you find out what plans are rare you can sell those for a bunch.
---
Sometimes I do the job myself, sometimes I just like watching fireworks and the air time the scorched get during bombardment.
---
I want to answer all your questions but I'll get straight to the point and say fallout 76 can be enjoyed casually as a solo player for free until you feel like you have the option to commit to the community and  play with others but if you decide to keep your own pace then you can explore the vastness of Appalachia and not have to worry about anyone but yourself. 
---
Just a heads up:
---
- Game has multitude of bugs both good and bad
---
- Inventory Management is tight as a non-sub
---
- FO1st Sub is slightly more expensive then most MMOs but does offer a few goodies (check it out) 
---
- The community is great and friendly (best I have experienced so far) 
---
I shelved most of my other gaming habits to play more Fallout 76. 
---
Hope this helps abit. 
---
From a fellow GW2 player.
---
Yeah, I mentioned that, but it's not appearing as an event for me as of yet.  Was hoping there ware other reliable areas.
---
I finally had it pop up an hour ago! But for 3 days I hadn't seen either. It feels empty lately.
---
Its feels like they never come around anymore but before patch 21 it felt like they were every 5 minutes
---
I'd be really surprised if they cycled atoms back in for those that finished early.  Something a bit more likely would be a stretch goal.  Like after you're done, every 5k score or so, you get another lunchbox/scrip or bullion pack. That would keep more people interested, at least.
---
For perspective, I started a month late and I'm level 68.... By my calculations, if I do all my dailies/weeklies, get an average of 30,000 xp per day (which is like 1.8 level ups for me at player lvl 130), **AND** if we manage to get the double daily reward and/or extra challenges reward from the Fortifying Atlas event--- then I will make it. Without the reward I will end up at around 94.   
---
I think my math is right: After score level 70 you need an average of 30 of the repeatable xp rewards to get ***1 level*** (you need 2700-3450 score per level after lvl70. 10,000xp =100 score, 300,000 xp = 3000 score). This means you need on average 300,000xp for 1 score level. If you can get loads of xp per day it definitely *helps*, and if you can get about 45,000 xp per day that's 1 score level per week. But with only 3 weeks left that's only 3 levels, and it's a grind. Pray for the double daily or bonus challenge rewards, or make sure you save your atoms to spend on levels if you really want the final rewards.
---
At some point, they fixed this.
---
Improved my silo times quite a bit, and make that section somewhat cathartic to run again.
---
You all are so weird, the 15min load screens are my favorite map🙂 and the one song over and over and over again!
---
Remove most of the way the game works and add some harder dungeons and content raids
---
What is the point of that, when the Atom shop is updated weekly? I genuinely don't understand why they would want players on every day. It has the effect of causing burnout, since it feels less like leisure and more like work.
---
If you are interested in trading that BE handmade, I have a 3* Bloodied Grognak Axe for you.
---
It was nice. 2-3 players in the workbench room almost all the time. Vender bot had probably 10-30 legendaries that people had dumped. More legendaries in the cash reg. Nukes fairly often with lot of bloaters. It all died when Beth changes the nuke spawn rates and drops in white springs.
---
Not how I do it but sure
---
If you're on mobile, head to the subreddit page and tap the three dots in the top right corner and select change user flair.
---
Can't wait for them big titty mods!!
---
Sometimes it just happens.
---
Just like how sometimes, launch prep gets stuck and never ends.
---
Maybe there's a way around it, but it's not worth it.  By the time you sit there and figure it out, you could have gone to a different silo or a different server.
---
It sucks, but I accept it as a sign that it's a bad server to launch a nuke on in the first place.
---
I both love and hate dailies...
---
On the one hand, I got from level 25, to level 60.
---
On the other hand, I barely did any story quests this whole time.
---
Okay. I think I understand you a bit more now, Its probably harder to tell on SBQ because of her overall HP, this is a bug clearly, where it SHOWS you doing stealth damage, but clearly (going by the enemies HP) the damage is not actually being applied. I'm really sorry, I have run into this bug and its a VATS only thing afaik. I just got a bit confused (blame it on lack of sleep) and thought you were referring to damage numbers. My bad. It doesn't always seem to happen, but I just went and tested the mirelurk thing you mentioned, I had them attack some mirelurks, first mirelurk I attacked (that was in combat) stealth damage was applied normally. However, when I attacked the king that was in combat, VATS damage was showing large numbers, but it took ages to get him down. I dragged another king over and had this one fight the blood eagle and was able to use VATS to melt him. Definitely an odd bug.
---
Honestly, my gauss miniguns and my gauss shotgun just sit in the stash. The minigun works great but 2mm EC weighs too much for me to haul thousands of rounds without ammo weight legendary effects or more levels of Batteries Included than I want to use. Bloody thing chews through 600 rounds in seconds. 
---
The shotgun is just a mess, but great when it works properly. Random damage, random hit chances especially in VATS, randomly dying if you're caught in the blast when taking enemy damage, and random freezing up requiring you to either bash or holster the shotgun to unfreeze it. 
---
Basically, minigun is great if you want everything dead but have weight for 50 lbs of ammo. And the shotgun makes you as dangerous to yourself as you are to enemies.
---
Foreal the game does feel like a chore right now. I wish they'd add raids and dungeons with special named loots and gears like vault 94 just more solo and group shit to do.
---
&gt;a few minutes
---
Please share with the class how you manage to do all the dailies in "a few minutes"
---
Where'd the ball come from? Only ones I find are deflated
---
Until you get frog legs, the bushes are the fastest way to level... Level + frog legs = win 😄
---
So fully ranking 5 cards can give you 79 perk cards to wear at all times, with a minimum of 5 points per SPECIAL stat. Even 10 more perk cards and the lockpick card is nuts.
---
I'm hoping that the rest of the non SPECIAL boosts are good/unique enough that it forces some design decisions as opposed to just going balls out for more points. 
---
I selfishly wish we had a pts for the x box so I could play around with it. 
---
I can't wait.
---
You're intelligence special must be so low D:

Todd Howard as the Overseer.
---
Not sure what things GW2 is going though, I had stopped playing after the first living season thing started, a bit after Lion's Arch got wrecked.
---
Never played ESO, so also not sure how that game is, to make comparisons.
---
To start answering some of your questions,
---
I pretty much played solo the entire game and only started teaming up when the public teams came out.
---
2-4 hours a day, is fine, there are daily quests that are available that give some rewards, exp, and caps. You can completely ignore them if you want and just do your own thing.
---
My first character, I did no builds, and just wandered and explored. This, I found to be very good. Wasn't doing any quests, was just exploring. I actually didn't start doing many of the quests till level 40 cause of all the exploring I was doing. 
---
You absolutely can solo the story, but you may have to grind a little to have good weapons and armor in order to complete it. Many seem to rush the story and as a result, they have sub-par gear and armor. Now this isn't always a bad thing, as it can give tougher fights, which can be memorable.
---
Public teams allow you to just jump into a team, if that's what you want.
---
There is competition for drops in that you have to tag enemies by dealing some damage to it before it dies in order to loot the body. Some people one-shot things, preventing others from tagging. But there are also people who will call others over using emotes to let others know there is a legendary nearby.
---
Loot is instanced, but you do have to tag in order to loot.
---
Trading is complicated, too complicated.
---
Convenience is not in the vocabulary for this game.
---
Some quests/events you get automatically in the area, some you have to talk to NPCs, normally there is a marker on the HUD that shows you which NPC or object to interact with.
---
I don't have FO-1st subscription, I would say to not do the sub first, and if you like the game then consider it. Not having it means you have to manage your inventory more, but it's not impossible.
---
You can earn atoms in game, less so now than in the past. There are some P2W in the cash shop, but most are cosmetic.
---
Why does everyone have to put a tent anyway. I don't because I can just use one of the 15 already there.
---
Take an upvote.
---
So far nothing has come back in for 1st
---
Under the "create post" button there is a dropdown called "community options" click that and you should see an option for "user flair"
---
I don't play nearly as much as many other players but not being married or having kids at 33 has its perks. I work, come home to play video games to wash away the sour taste of spending 8 hours of my day mindlessly working on cars and then sleep. If I wanted to, I could easily put 50+ hours a week into this game but instead I'm somewhere in the 10-20 hour a week range. But I do have other games I like playing and I live with friends so I gotta spend time with them too lol
---
Ammo is so damn easy to get anyone that runs a gatling gun power armour build should pretty much always have 20k+ ammo same with the .50 cal but with slightly more effort
---
Searching for that ever elusive legendary item that's just over the horizon.
---
thanks
---
Yeah, at the current pace it might as well never happen. They'll most likely kill the game earlier than it'll come to full mod support implementation.

reinstalling on drive with OS should work

I don’t want to spoil it, but if you've made it to the Whitesprings VIP Bunker you should do a scan through all the terminals in there. You'll find out why the liberators are everywhere.
---
You gotta dial 9 first
---
Pretty sure there's always one in the agricultural center
---
here is another comment complaining about another post complaining about people complaining...
---
I found a guy yesterday that had 45000 ammo in his vending machine so I went to check it out and he two walls of punji boards lining the hallway.  I didn't have any junk so I tried to run to the end of the hall but got speared.  It was probably all .38 ammo.
---
Thank you for finally saying it. I’ve actually enjoyed most of the run honestly, it doesn’t take too long to complete the dailies. None of the rewards are so dire that I feel the need to grind the event, but I’m sitting pretty at rank 82 so I’ll definitely finish. If you want to buy all the ranks then go ahead, but the grinders who complete the repeatable 2000 times need to knock it off.
---
Have you tried putting up some temp stairs and taking out the stairs that have the mesh upper floor and beams?  Then putting your walls in and then putting the stairs back?
---
You have perks enabled that allow crafted weapons to have extra durability. That white bar inside is that extra durability.
---
you have to put the walls in before the stairs.
---
Indeed - all so pointless isn't it...
---
I meant a few minutes per challenge.  Less than 30 minutes for all for sure.  Any single one of them with the exception of a few outliers are brain-dead simple.  Chew gum, kill 10 scorched, build this or that, claim a workshop, mod a weapon,  if you're spending more than 90 seconds on any of these you are doing it wrong.  
---
Now that I have been completed on the pass for awhile and I don't look at the challenges, most days after just playing and doing my normal routine for a couple hours I will look at the challenges and see I have them all done except for NW.  Just by playing the game I did them without even knowing what they are.  It would be difficult to actually make them any easier.
---
Like I mentioned, there are some outliers such as find a bobblehead that may take longer.  But this is where you do the smart choice and say "what will take me more time?  get 30,000 xp or find a bobblehead?"  Do a few west-tek runs hit up a line in the sand and you are already back in the green if you don't want to look for a bobblehead or survive in NW.
---
If you nuke foundation, they'll want rad-ex. If you give them some rad-ex, they'll want radsuits. 
---
If you give them radsuits they'll want more. 
---
If you give them more, they'll develop a taste for human blood. 
---
If they develop a taste for human blood, they'll become ghouls.
---
If they become ghouls, they'll have to make more.
---
Now, if they make more ghouls they'll need to feed.
---
If they feed too much, the BoS will come out.
---
If the BoS come out, they'll take all our cork and will become fodder for the ghouls.
---
The the BoS fail, then MODUS will call in a nuclear strike.
---
If a nuke is dropped, hundreds of people will die. Apalachia will become a nuclear wasteland and the 76ers will fall apart.
---
With nobody to stop the ghouls everyone else everywhere will launch nukes to stop the ghouls.
---
Eventually the world will be totally destroyed.
---
...and that's why I had to kill daddy...he kept nuking foundation...goodnight.
---
Are you shooting enemies? IIRC durability only drops upon hitting an enemy.
---
EDIT: also bashing with the weapon i think drops durability faster.
---
I'm pretty sure its the upper floors touching where the walls are going to go that are messing with it... take the upper floors down, place your walls, then put the upper floors back where they were. hope that helps!
---
Besides the scrap box and private servers, Fallout 1st has been ass...but I'll keep giving them my money because the scrap box is worth it lol
---
At this point I would just be happy if the score meter stopped showing up all the time after I finished. I get excited and then remember it's over, and it bums me out.
---
That’s a double bar, try beating the snot out of low level scorched with it.  Bonus:  that also counts for killing for a challenge.
---
Yeah, I am disappointed no eggs. But what kind of eggs? There are no chicken eggs in game, so no recipes that would use them.  Radtoad eggs, mothman eggs, but nothing that would use chicken eggs.
---
Of course you do
---
Are you actually shooting mobs with it? Just firing it into the air won't make it lose durability. You have to actually cause damage with it .
---
That just tells them via wallet-votes that this is OK dev behavior
---
I'll have to punch 1100 robots to death in a hurry
---
Soooooo......I have my PS4 in my basement gym.....And FO76 and work out at the same time......got you covered....
---
...but what is a huge grav.....???
---
(I am old)...
---
Okay. Guessing you’re crafting them and you have high INT, or if finding them in the wild you have high Luck. 
---
That xbow is “overcrafted” ie has over 100% CND
---
Bash a few lvl 1 Libby’s or Scorch and it will come down.
---
Oh good I'm at 80 and for some reason thought I only had a week or so left. Probably cause the posts that people are buying their way to 100 already.
---
Didnt know that happened. That sound like a bummer.
---
Sweetwater's Special Blend is alcoholic, so no.
---
I'll give it a try, thank you!
---
How is that possible, how much crap do you hoard
---
I had 150 pounds of pure flux in my stash box that I gave to a friend with FO1st to look after and all my crap fits in my storage again.
---
I left the game for 2 months (I've +200 level) came back,  played for 20 minutes and shut it off. This game is soooooooo boring. Screw grinds. There's no need.  The game is easy too easy already.
---
Didn't know that. Noob mistake here, thank you.
---
I think the value of “total time logged in” is a misconception many players have. If this were true, there would be no AFK timer. Repeated daily logins are what drive the game. 
---
On a related note, I believe that the value of veteran players to the company is another big misconception. I feel Beth would rather have longtime 76 vets move on to other titles and make room for new players with new money and plenty of camp budget. This is the concept behind free-to-play, to keep that fresh money rolling in.
---
Chicken coop provides chicken poop.  It's as simple as that.
---
EXACTLY no-one told you to grind out west tek 200s a day.
---
I was thinking that as well. It takes at least a few minutes to log onto NW (if he has been collecting SCORE from that event).
---
Warframe has a catch-up mechanic for their weeklies (I think it's something like once you've done 80% of the current weeklies it'll start bringing up tasks from the previous week you missed). It also has daily log-in bonuses (which are mostly garbage but sometimes include XP/resource/credit boosters, and you're guaranteed something tasty every 50 days you log in).  
---
Whales and impatient people are still gonna buy ranks.
---
Yeah, the problem must be the upper floor. Thank you!
---
The main issue is having to do with with weapons that you don't have legendaries and perks for. Lets use crossbows for example. If you have a build that does not invest heavily into agility, you won't be able to equip perk cards that increase damage to crossbows. Also, you will have to spend time/caps/scrips to find powerful crossbows in order to complete the challenges. Using a basic crossbow without perks to try to kill high level scorched will be tedious. 
---
I am not arguing against challenges and I am looking forward to one wasteland for that reason. I am just saying that you can save yourself some headache and do some of these more annoying challenges now.
---
I'm playing sometime tonight with maybe two of my friends M0J1T04951 Lv 69 ;)
---
And boy do chickens poop
---
I am a newish player and dont have a ton of caps.  Plus uts seems like a waste to scrip this
---
Ok. I’ll add that to my to-do
---
Go to the Fairgrounds / Dirt track and bash the scortched and ghouls.  That should do it for you.  That is what I did and it worked for me.
---
Dang. There’s not cross play is there?
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
&gt;Talk about getting something SMALLER than expected.
---
Me: "I mean, it's a typical jar.  I don't understand what the complaint is."  
---
&gt;Has Bethesda seen the size of an Appalachia firefly
---
Me: "Oh.  You have a point, there."
---
....this keeps happening to me too.....I log on for an hour to kill some time and lose 4 hours somewhere.....
---
&gt;Whats causing it?
---
I think that’s the issue, I think it hasn’t been fixed yet because they don’t know whats actually causing it.  Some people never seem to get hit by it.  Some people seem to get it all the time. It’s incredibly hard to fix a bug when you can’t consistently recreate it.  
---
I do hope they fix it soon for everyone though.
---
Now it definitely needs the addition of a mangina to the Ghillie Suit...
---
Did you not buy yourself cake and booze?
---
But in wow it's pretty easy to swap your stuff around and depending on your class you can easily swap between roles, provided you have some gear to suit it. Some are even universal.
---
I also don't really feel like the game has roles at the moment. Sure some people are tanky but they're hardly tanks. If we're using WoW it's like saying a ret paladin can tank. Plus there's no real aggro system as far as I'm aware.
---
If anything support builds are nice but hardly what I would call a specialist.
---
It's basically all DPS with splashs of everything in between.
---
It's more like a single player game with friends than a real online game. Treating it like one, till it becomes one, just takes away from the gameplay.
---
The fact that you can share your perks is nice but there are plenty of discouraging factors in playing more than one character.
---
The system was never designed with legendary perks in mind or they would of never let you spend points to move specials. I have a freak that's 448 and he's got barely any points left because before all this, he's tried a lot of builds which required a lot of special swapping. If everything was scrap perk cards only he would be vastly behind, not considering that any level past 1k takes ten times as much exp!
---
You're not just snapping your fingers, there could be a cost (caps, bullions, scrip, etc) plus you also need the gear and perk cards for the new build, so that's a minimum of 9 perk coins for 3 full damage perks. Not to mention the others you needs.
---
Lastly, there are a limited amount of character slots. One basically has to be a bank so that's 4. Not to mention the slog of grinding rep/gold and non-tradeable weapons.
---
What I'm saying is it shouldn't be "snap of the fingers" easy or free but it shouldn't punish higher level players that "should of known" when they had no clue something like this was coming.
---
I feel like perk coins per level is a reasonable compromise that makes no one feel "cheated" and that everyone progresses the same.
---
Besides that i still personally believe that the level needed to cap out just 6 of the dozens of perk cards is far too high.
---
Nobody cares (exactly what people say to leaving posts).
---
Coops should also give eggs.  And salmonella.
---
How could you not choose to use a lunchbox. I hoard them and only use them at line or radiation tumble. Only smart way to get that score for new lvl each day when your lvl 200+.
---
I mean if they want to do it then they should go ahead. But then complaining about it is annoying.
---
If that reply came off as me being a dick I didnt mean for it too
---
No one bitched about dailies before the SCORE system... now all of a sudden it's a pain in the ass? Less than an hour a day. And yes, you can skip days. I've skipped quite a few and I'm rank 81. 
---
Oh, that's right. We don't want to buy atoms. 
---
Play or don't ... but please stop asking to make this game easier.
---
There's a nice little shack with some random cheeks that spawn occasionally with a plan at the corporate estate near Wavy Willard's, it has floaters to farm for acid and fuel as well. The shack is to your left from the fast travel spawn location
---
I made a post about this very thing last night. Since the last patch I've been crashing so hard that I started to wonder if it was my PC lol. It sucks but I'm glad to know I'm not alone here. I played for about 5 hours the other day and crashed 6 times. It's annoying but I'm hoping that they fix it with the next big patch. I crash all the time and there's no pattern to it. Game stutters, freezes, crashes. Guess we'll have to live with it until then lol. Good luck out there!
---
Most of the time the NW challenge was something like place your camp which took 4 seconds or use 3 stimpacks which took 4 minutes.
---
SS armor makes you look like an amateur stormtrooper cosplayer.
---
Oh, they'll co-exist.  There's no way Bethesda is throwing out the work they did for Wastelanders.  But I wouldn't be surprised if Fractured Steel moved up the game's timetable a bit.
---
Do you actually think the pass is too difficult?  Honest question.  Trying to understand.

^this

Because we enjoy it.

Daily’s, scrip limit and then NW because I want L100.
---
As I recall - it used to show as a power armour frame with '0' weight. It has no weight until you open it up then it goes to 10 lb. It should be the one with full ultracite armour.
---
Thank you everybody! Bashing it worked, I've just been shooting this whole time lol.
---
I wish they could check just how much I play every day and award me score and what not. Becauss I play about 6-7+ every day with my friend who's new to the game. I'll do my dalies and help her with hers, and then I'll go through with her helping her with what she needs and doing events, but they said they cant/won't. And it keeps happening so its gunna end up forcing me to buy like $40 of atoms and just buy the levels just before its over because of much i seem to be missing.
---
Make sure you bash enemies with it, loses durability faster than shooting with it.
---
That's fair but I meant more like literally anything else. There's no real damage at all beside rads and a dark screen.
---
This would be great. I hate not leveling up for the day and missing 500 score.
---
You don’t even need the perks. Just INT can do it.
---
Ohhhh! Thank you!
---
You should be fine my friend
---
Bet I'm Da Waffle H8ter. Add me
---
I can't believe someone saw how thick the legs are and said yeah this is it!
---
You're right! This worked, thank you!
---
I mind grinding... It sucks
---
Many things to go with here. But the best i ever had between all those sets i tested was a unyielding wood set. Made it possible to make a sneak char with double barrles.
---
Aight bro
---
The option to play golf at Whitesprings would be great. Bethesda needs to add this onto '76. Reminds me of Dawn of the Dead where the survivors play golf and hit the zombies with their golf balls.
---
Ok will do. What ab standing near or in that shed that is there. Does that mess up the queen
---
Nope, once again people are moaning in advance.
---
Juicehead thinks they may be hiding it but its very odd how its suppose to be patch 22 thing. Maybe some datamines today will reveal something.
---
Also stop throwing grenades. She flys away. Yell it on the mic if people do it.
---
If you cripple does it not spawn more?
---
added u
---
Hmmmm if you thought before writing nonesense you would've realised that dailies before season 1 were optional. You didn't need to do all of them so you don't miss out. I did all my dailies and weeklies and i'm at 79 so you either play 12hrs a day (what most of us can't do) to grind the repeatable or you are lying about rank/not doing all challenges
---
How do you do it then?
---

---
Includes mutations and desired gear.
---
Though, I do want to test out a 2shot with 4 leaf clover.
---
Anyway. Feel free to ask any questions.
---
I also understand why people rob people.  Doesn't mean it's okay.
---
They couldn't even be ass'd to paint the bottle cap.
---
Damn lol. Thanks for the heads up!
---
That's perfectly ok.
---
That could be a daily for a Season. Kill Whitesprings ghouls while wearing a golf outfit with a golf club
---
the chameleon mutation only works if you're not wearing armor. the CSS counts as armor.
---
having said that, yes. for some reason the chameleon mutation benefits your sneak to a small degree even if you're wearing armor. but the invisibility (from the mutation) won't trigger. so it's not like you can stack them.
---
i havve a BE 10mm smg that i jave never repaired
---
Or just use an improved repair kit on it....works for tadpole challenge
---
They love their Tesla gun obviously.
---
There's this whole pandemic thing going on so a lot of people are just stuck at home unemployed.
---
Run dailies, farm events for ultra rare drops that arent actually great to be a plan completionist, getting double drops from events because I run a 2nd account on a 2nd xbox which i tend to level characters passively to 50 thanks to unyielding armor, being a part of a rp/clan and do "missions", ughhhh...yeah.
---
I had the same thought too.
---
Guessing this hasn't been patched?  Playing on Xbox and got to the same room and Ra-Ra is just stood there and won't open the door to the PA room. 
---
C'mon Bethesda.. Spent an age stocking up on ammo to do this quest and now I'll have to restart it and lose the ammo (as well as Stimpacks and food/water) that I've used..
---
Gotcha. Yeah it would be interesting to see how that could be implemented. 
---
Maybe some buildings get destroyed and you get some rare resources or such.
---
I tried. I can get it close, but directly under it pops it inside the bottom of the cage as red.
---
i used to see fireflies randomly at twin lakes, but nothing reliable
---
Moaning? So pointing out a flaw in the system is moaning?
---
Exactly, I feel like people are defending Beth's bad business practices a little too agressively. If people are paying now, they'll still be paying.
---
So how is season1?  I havnt played the game at all since that dropped cuz i hate how it was forcing me to do challenges to get a score.really wish there was a better way of handling it.
---
And you have my bow
---
There are "frogs" in the cave where you find Lou.
---
Yes it litterally is, just because they hired someone independent doesnt mean it isnt their concept art, I cant belive how dense you are, the bird IS an early scorch beast design.
---
Yeah I just subbed this past weekend and I’ve gone from avoiding junk entirely to grabbing everything. Wish there was more than a rug and valentine’s themed bed this month though lol.
---
chameleon stacks. HTD doesn't. and the chameleon mutation jerks when you shoot, making you visible for a bit.
---
If you can get to level 90 and use Atoms for the final ten levels, it comes out as a "wash" (Atoms earned during event). It's not ideal if you really want the atoms you earned for the event, but you also don't "lose" any. I got tired of the grind and that's what I did.
---
I respect if you dont enjoy the game and decide not to do the Legendary Run.
---
Did anyone get this resolved for them? Did they send atoms to make up the lost progress or anything?
---
Maybe make certain locations destroyable. Would be a lot of fun but sounds like a lot of work on Beth's end.
---
&gt; Perk coins per level is a reasonable compromise that makes no one feel "cheated" and that everyone progresses the same.
---
And here’s where I disagree. I don’t think it’s a reasonable compromise.  I want to scrap my cards for the points.  I want to get rid of the duplicate cards. It’s not my fault that your friend (or anyone else) decided to keep spending points on one character rather than trying out builds on different characters.  I should not be penalized or cheated because I decided to actually USE my other 4 character slots. I’ve done the grind for rep and bullion on other characters.  I don’t think everyone should progress the same like that.
---
You on console or pc?
---
I prefer MachoMan
---
&gt; Yeah. Once you pass level 100 it requires alot of effort to completely level up in a day 
---
I think this is heavily dependent on play style.  In the mid 200s, I get a level in about 2-3 hours of "miscellaneous" playing.  (not focused on leveling, but the things I enjoy doing).
---
if I'm focused on leveling, it's 30-40 minutes.
---
Yeah, that's a server glitch. When that happens you'll need to hop servers to a different one. I run in to that problem at least once every 5 runs.
---
my suspicion is that anything new they add is intended to be very easily skinned for atx
---
Supposedly sometime today.
---
You never know though.  Might end up being delayed.
---
Is there any point in accumulating fertilizer?  I don't know of any item I want to craft that uses it.  Ridiculous "reward" -- I scrapped mine as soon as I realized it was just a budget hogging decorative item.
---
Nothing in this game is climatic. You finish the main story line and nothing happens lol you just don’t get another quest.
---
HAHAHAHA yesss
---
Im 14 but dont worry I aint a fortnite screecher. Hope you dont have a problem with that
---
Stealing from people in game is totally acceptable and there's a whole system around it. He's not stealing from anyone and Beth's known about the bug for a while and even when they do fix it, I doubt they're going to punish anyone.
---
If it was that game breaking I feel like they would of done something much sooner.
---
That's by design.  Make you want an upgrade.  Something's got to make them gears turn.
---
What time were you guys planning to farm the event. My friend and I have wanted to farm the event (both of us have 1500 hours+) but it's just super annoying to do with less than 3 people. Unfortunately I have limited availability this weekend, but I could join for at least a few events depending on the time. Also, my friend and I both have the friendly fire perk + SS shishkebabs to heal the friendlies.
---
i am on level 75ish, haven’t taken it too seriously. no NW. not sure any of it is worth more grind
---
Absolutely not! It’s a good thing we don’t have crossplay too... If PC were to infect our (somewhat) cheat free lobbies with their dirty hacked weapons and armor, it’d make it even more unbearable than it already is.
---
Depends on what the other stars are.
---
PC. I imagine these are illicit items, should I drop them?
---
Starting to look like a music festival with all your hippy tents all over the place.
---
I'm a casual player, so I'm interesting in doing new stuff each time I login, not repeating shit that I've already done over and and over. Dailies have no interest for me once I've done them once, and honestly they often feel like a waste of time the first time.
---
Thanks, I will try that then, too. Maybe I am lucky. Normally I go home immediately. Frustrated. ;)
---
Acid, ammo, blood (human or otherwise) variants of nuka.
---
A now you're moaning because you've been called out on it. Quite relentless really.
---
I haven't spent any atoms on it yet aswell. Just been forcing myself through it. I figured I would be just about done half way through next week if I was getting all of my dailies plus both set of weeklies, but knowing my luck it will mess up again and I'll get nothing. I would probably be almost finished this week if I hadn't missed any challenges. The only ones I havent done were the nuclear winter ones. Other than that, I've completed every single daily and weeklie, minus the ones where it decided I wasn't allowed to. And I really don't want to have to spend any atoms on the pass. How many more weeks is it?
---
Upvote just for the post title. HAH
---
the shrouded mod for wood doesn't work. the speed bonus does, allegedly. but speed demon already caps your movement speed at max, crouching or otherwise.
---
shadowed stacks. they also fixed it so shadowed now works for every armor type that has the mod available.
---
the shrouded mod also does not have the muffled effect. and most armor types can be shadowed *and* muffled, in fact, robot and scout are the only armor types with muffled arms.
---
chameleon stacks.
---
Spawn in at the gazebo by Bolton Greens, loot the chest there and then head due south into the open field. I almost always find stuff there and no other players seem to go there. You can sometimes find ghouls at Bolton Greens itself but it's usually crawling with other players, too.
---
if you ask me, no. It’s not like these items are wildly overpowered. it might be like the gilded minigun
---
Completely agree with you here, all the challenges are mega easy and I either do them within 20 minutes of starting the game up or I passively do them while I'm doing other stuff. I've never had to put any effort into anything since it's started.
---
I meant irl.  It's not so much that it's game breaking as I have to do the work and he doesn't I have to deal with it so should he
---
Dang. Well I guess I know not to die right after. Thanks!
---
Play bush Wookiee until the end of the 2nd storm circle. Creatures appear much more frequently after that.
---
Thanks a lot, guys, now I feel like an asshole.
---
Yeah that seems to by my experience as well.  The only actual effort I put in myself was grinding XP for the repeatable because I wanted to.
---
True. If the pc players were with us they would bring their hacks too
---
I’ve heard that if you play around the time the dailies reset (12PM EST) it causes them to autocomplete
---
That's pretty neat.
---
And everyone is bloodied...
---
I'm sure some just want to get it over as quickly as possible.
---
I am currently rank 90 or 91 and I've been playing every day and have done most of the challenges (about 1/3 of the nuclear winter challenges, and I've missed the 2 bobbleheads). Each day takes approximately 45 minutes - an hour and a half to complete everything on public servers. 
---
I know that once I hit the end I'll wish that I was still getting something for completion. Unfortunately, there are enough people out there that were able to somehow earn enough xp at the beginning and cheat their way through it, that having a repeatable would lead to a means to generate an arbitrarily large numbers of free atoms once the board was completed and Bethesda will (probably?) never let themselves open to an exploit that directly affects their revenue stream.
---
*an addition - Strangely, half of the fun of this has been just seeing how far I am progressing on the board. Only 3 or 4 of the rewards really interested me (beyond the scrip/caps etc.) so just staying a few squares ahead of Morbo has been my primary motivator. All the other stuff is just frosting on the cake that is knowing my bitchin camaro of a rocket ship is leaving his punk ass crab claw looking hoopty in the dust.
---
SUCK SPACE DUST NERD
---
And yet you might finish the run
---
They are indeed. I probably would but in sure how they handle that type of stuff on console
---
I'll take them. I started a few days ago and I think it was yesterday I learned that you can make fertilizer from them. Ive been just tossing them on the ground before hand.
---
Beware with Poseidon, enemies for the defend the workshop will spawn behind the blast doors on tye south end. Vats to find them and explosives generally work, but its tedious.
---
Most of the time im on around half an hour after reset. Today I was on about ten minutes after. On the weekly reset this week I wasn't on for about and an hour to an hour and a half after reset.
---
We are fairly flexible. We are looking at any time after 12 est.
---
Gt: crimson angel7
---
They are to all effects pretty useless, but they sure are a strange choice of items to hack or however are they created.
---
Why not have both? Scrapping cards would just get you there a tiny bit faster but not be required to strip every "non-essential" perk.
---
You're right that it's not your fault but...it's not his either. The system was literally designed for that or you wouldn't be able to do it at all.
---
How would you be penalized? Literally nothing would be taken from you, if anything you'd better off.
---
It's fine that the grind wasn't that bad for you but you also understand how much effort and time it is to do all that. This game has far more casual players than hardcore.
---
On that note, not everyone starts the game knowing exactly what they want to build, so points are going to be wasted.
---
Hm, what to say, what to say. Something fitting, witty, and yet a solid rebuttal. Ah, I've got it!
---
No u.
---
Jump servers.
---
All paddle ball mods are unavailable atm. They exist in the files only because they were carried over from FO4, but they can't be obtained ingame. That didn't stop people to get them anyway.
---
No idea about the recipe, sorry. Never heard of it.
---
And don't worry about them, nothing is going to happen to you for knowing them. I don't know anybody who has been banned for knowing dev room plans.
---
It was not in the games marketing
---
Often people confuse requests to fix annoying bugs as complaining. Nothing wrong with wanting something to be better since many of use have spent a lot of hours playing.
---
Maybe ask the community for feedback on bug fix priority.  I’d much rather have the fast travel bug fixed before well....anything.
---
Ah, very well, Sir. So, as Commander-in-Chief, and therefore responsible for all actions and activities of the US Government, which includes the Enclave...
---
What are your orders?
---
*Remember, with great power comes great accountability and culpability.*
---
Well, goodbye to my caps I guess. Why in earth would anyone chose these two items, that only a completionist type of person would buy anyways, is beyond me though.
---
They were stolen from the dev room, and dupes did the rest.
---
I want eggs.
---
&gt;  Its like, you're level 230 what do you need those two stupid pieces of brahmin meat for?
---
Carryweight boost!
---
The worst thing about dropping them is that you have to be really careful not to drop some valuable gear in the process, since they throw the exact same warning.
---
Thank you for the explanation, I was really puzzled about it.
---
Yeah, it actually was.  Believe whatever you want though.
---
Can't work due to Covid, can't play anything else that I like (Forza) due to a recent surgery on my hand. 76 is easy to play because I can just walk around and explore without straining my injury.
---
I put mine on the free slocum joe sign, frames it pretty well too.
---
Link to the video/article from bethesda?
---
They take like half n hour sometimes less depends on bobblehead finding daily
---
&gt;Does this thing happen often?
---
every single day.
---
I already have somewhere around 20-30 modules taking up space in my stash so I'm buying exclusively steel. Especially since my current project is strangler PA, which will just eat up a ton of steel. I already have a full set of thorn armor I'm satisfied with and very good rolls for all the wastelander weapons. I don't even know what I'll use the modules I already have on tbh
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
The Dailies are not too bad. But they do need some tweaking. Like when it was the Bobblehead one the other day. I server hopped, did circuit after circuit after circuit. Even tried private worlds every few hours or so. Could not find one at all. So I missed out on those. They need to up the spawn rate.
---
Making it so that it’s impossible to finish the board unless you play SEVERAL hours everyday to earn the repeatable xp goal is obviously just a money grab to motivate people to buy atoms. It’s so underhanded
---
I wouldn't worry much about it bud as they are gonna completely remove those mechanics soon.....
---
Which is a valid concern, but one that has still existed for the entirety of this game. LOP the was never immune from that issue, but they're acting like the level adjustments will suddenly make all events unplayable for low levels. That simply isn't the case. If anything, the level adjustments means that they can take part in events with harder fights (SBQ, PP, FR, HotS), more spawns, and a greater chance at gear. If they really want to voice a concern, a better one would be to demand that Bethesda ties legendary rewards to event participation rather than tagging the legendary creature. Right now, they are just complaining to complain.
---
Oh I get it you’re trolling. Carry on. I thought the if then statement had confused you. My bad.
---
On PS4 at the Lucky Mart i sell 15 c per scrip.  1 star weapons are @75, 2 star @225 and 3 star @600.  They go pretty quickly.  Armors are also at 15c per scrip.
---
There has been no exact date stated but they said mid-Sept. If they stay true to form and end on a Tues, it seems logical that it would be the 15th. If that is the case  you have 4 weeks and 3-ish days from today. Also, if enough cork is delivered by tomorrow, next weekend is a double score daily (and even if the cork goal isn't reached, i don't think they will not do the double weekend anyway). If you continue the grind, like you have, you will almost certainly finish in time.
---
Which issue do you mean? Do you mean build-lockin because everything non-essential gets scrapped?
---
I'd like a system where you're not forced to scrap perk cards because the majority of points comes from levels. You may be inclined to get rid of trash cards you definitely don't need but should not be encouraged to scrap anything you might need.
---
Think 2, 3, 4 etc. points from levels, and scrapping always gives only one point so it has diminshing returns anyway.
---
Wait you mean I wasn't meant to solo farm scorch beasts for 3 days from level 35 to level 80 to get the full set of plans for ultracite power armour 😅😅😅 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Still haven't finished the main quest and I'm at level 150+ now
---
You both have the choice to cheat it not to cheat. You chose not to so you have to work.
---
They updated the system for the PTS. One card = 2 coins. Long time plates lost perk cards to a glitch and to moving special points instead of picking a new perk card.
---
Absolutely! It's obvious this is a learning process for them, and I'm happy to he a part of it.
---
Less than a minute to watoga.
---
Two of my first three NW matches my team won, then I started trying and have not made it past 8 yet.
---
Make the dailys worth less, and the weeklys worth more to compensate. 
---
The dailys are nice to give you something to do, but not everyone can play every day.
---
Are you a bloodied build?
---
This. 1000%
---
And get banned?  Plus don't they not make 2 mm?  Yeah, I can't cheat even if I wanted to
---
"Does this thing happen often?"
---
All the time, to many players.
---
Former rigger , dozen egg omelette for dinner coming off night shifts were common for me. I miss making great money and having a buff body just for working.
---
Well a simple fix could be removing the repeatable once you complete the board. Cuz even without exploits, xp is easy to get, you could farm atoms like crazy and that too would affect their revenue stream.
---
I believe you meant, Thomas The Dank Engine
---
There has been a recent bug of interiors being inaccessible so its possible.
---
lol no need to. I play NW only to get score and unlock skins, I felt that many fellow bush wookies are in the same boat, no need to end their efforts prematurely after the long wait in the lobby.
---
Dailies are still optional.
---
When the dailies awarded only atoms and nothing else people were grinding those out without a word. (other than that the atom shop was overpriced and they couldn't do enough dailies to buy what they wanted)
---
Not happy unless everyone gets everything with minimal effort which makes getting rewards mean nothing.
---
We already have both options. Daily for when we can do them (typically in less than an hour save for the level up one)... and weekly to catch up for missing some dailies.
---
I do not play all day every day as I have a full time job. That being said, I didn't expect to be able to get to rank 100 and if I didn't, that would be ok with me because I understand that sometimes not everyone gets the big prizes without some effort. 
---
But because we want to keep bitching about not being able to get everything because it's not fair to the casual players... please... this can't get any easier.
---
If it comes up you just have to change servers, it’s a bug
---
I've never understood why people feel so pressured to complete it, to the point of ruining the game for themselves. Almost everything is purely cosmetic or can be earned other ways in game; only the clean sink and the ammo converter have any unique utility, and they're right at the beginning. 
---
I've just been playing the game normally. I'm not going to do anything that reduces my enjoyment of it. I see the SCORE rewards as an occasional bonus rather than a mandatory grind. I'm only rank 45 or so, and I definitely won't complete it, but that's okay. FOMO doesn't really apply if you prioritize enjoyment.
---
I never saw this event showing up... Is it not as common as the Mothman or Mirelurk Queen event? To me it seems there are some events that are happening very regularly and some only once in a while.
---
:0
---
Happened to me today, too.
---
All of them except for the nuclear winter ones.  Which are 3/5 completed for some reason.  bizzare.
---
Good for you!
---
Server hop
---
The people who hate on the game do so just to have someone hear them complain. I call 76 shit all the time but I never take my bitching to anyone else's feet. Granted, it's usually because I accidentally choose the wrong consumable in my hotwheel or I blow myself up while fighting ghouls or melee enemies... Still, some people just like to shine light on the bad times they have and sometimes those get brought up more often than the good times everyone else has.
---
Toss em in the air and shoot them for entertainment
---
First it should be raw fertilizer and TP.
---
Second only foodbuilds would be triggered because regular players dont give two sh*ts about their camp.
---
Since there re almost no regular players left... maybe ur right!
---
Watch some how to YouTube videos
---
Wonder if they will add a crazy golf course as a mini game at the gold resort? 
---
Or use the existing course as a usable golf course as an event? Sink 3/4 holes in 20 mins??
---
if only you could leave the team or ask someone not to share a perk but alas you cannot
---
Yee
---
The game's not hard, it's tedious. That's the whole problem. If you can really enjoy grinding the same few non-changing things every day for several hours for months, then fine for you. But the majority of players wants diversity, content and wants to play the game rather than grind it.
---
The fact that every effort Bethesda puts out seems to culminate in a boring grind is not because you few matter, it's because Bethesda sucks at game design for MMOs and of course, management. All of us players don't really matter in the end, the graphs and shareholders do.
---
I certainly do not have time to go through all of their videos over their lunch break.  I'll try to remember to get back to you.
---
But they ABSOLUTELY initially said we'd be able to build settlements with each other - others on this very post mention it if you don't want to take my word.  If you get tired of waiting, well, Google works just as well for you as for me.
---
Remind me! 7 hours provide source
---
Lord forgive me for mentioning this game
---
Back whenever I used to play fortnite before they ruined it, I’m pretty sure there was 1 daily challenge and it gave you either 1/2 a tier or a whole tier, I don’t remember.
---
Here we are with Bethesda’s NINE daily challenges plus SEVEN weekly for, towards the end of the season, a measly 3 tiers
---
It’s honestly bullshit and way too much grinding for too little rewards. If I wasn’t already invested all the way to tier 70, I wouldn’t be doing it at all. Next season I won’t do shit
---
Possibly they patched it then, I have never tried again since it was first messed up.  At the time it would show damage numbers and the faceplate would fall off of the core but it would still need to be removed.  This was months back so I would hope it's been patched at least.
---
Damn autocorrect.
---
RemindMe! 7 hours provide source
---
It's easy to ignore the meta and still find life in the game, which is good. You're lucky to have played to 190 and still have more to achieve! That play style is admirable.
---
Awesome, that will likely work. My GT is megalornn, my friend's GT is Oliver Klohzof.
---
I do too. Might pick this up also...
---
100% agree! Best fights i had happened there... good old times!
---
Essentially, dick around
---
I finished my forever home on my main a few weeks back, and it's beautiful! Granted, I have many many hours building and testing tricks so it's unique in that way as well as general design. It's actually going to be the first camp of the week for the gentleman that's taking over the series for Decoy's Dungeon, if you're familiar with the building side of 76 youtube videos.
---
hahaha
---
Can we go back to getting Atoms for the daily?
---
Different bug.  Wild Appalachia locations have a history of doing this going back as long as they have been in the game.  Just need to change servers to get it to load correctly.
---
They had a Secret Service backpack at one point, grey exterior, sort of tactical, that might be what you're looking for as it was only 500 atoms if I remember right.
---
Who is wearing Crocs!
---
It’s not a “fellow 76er,” it’s just wearing a basic outfit
---
I've got 14 toons.
---
A different bug? In a bethesda game? That's crazy talk!
---
You can leave a team.
---
Edit:  adding a screen grab to show how to leave a team.

-Get a Foodbuild first subscription (one month)

-pick up fights against every high level player u come across as long as ur under lvl 50
---
-loot loot loot
---
-stash stash stash
---
rinse and repeat if ur scrapbox gets empty.
---
Hard to believe isn't it??  Lol.
---
Lol, that's crazy.  :-)
---
Personally, I wouldn't have bothered trying to tame it.  Some asshat (or noob) will just kill it anyway, especially since it is a legendary.  
---
I stopped taming animals/creatures for this reason.  Would always find them dead with a day or two.  Much sooner than that, often.
---
final boss of the game. also I'm pretty sure we've had this same thread yesterday.
---
Scortchbeast queen, it’s a boss fight
---
When you nuke that area it activates an end game boss battle
---
Nice, sounds like you have some diversity going on in terms of builds. I just ask because I’ve seen a lot of folks complaining about wanting more difficult content but they play the OP meta.
---
End game world boss the scorch beast queen :)
---
*probably* will end up being delayed
---
In fairness, the "President" had to execute most of the East Coast Enclave because they thought his plan to continue the war against China was batshit crazy. And when the Enclave soldiers found out he planned to unleash Scorchbeasts on American citizens, they got super pissed off and killed him. Modus ended up killing everyone in the chaos since he was half insane from damage. 
---
Not everyone in the Enclave were monsters. Same goes for the BoS. And neither are the settlers all good people; like that stupid cowardly bastard running Anchor farm. They are all just... people. With all the good and bad that comes with being human in a difficult environment.
---
Wouldn't you rather crawl in the bath with your fiance?
---
Yeah. I'm AFK a lot. I'll end up with no rads (sun kissed), like just a few hp, no ap, completely starving and completely dehydrated, and all my food and drinks spoiled.
---
I'll be in Chinese Stealth Armor crouched in a corner. Nothing sees me, so I never die.
---
You'll never die from starvation or dehydration, you'll just be weak.
---
Eat some dog food, slam some purified water, and be on your way. With Good Doggy, I end up all healed up, no rads, and totally satiated.
---
Not bloodied, obviously. 😀
---
Oh also, forgot to add, Instead of having new cool variants of animals and robots, they just make the stronger variants look the exact same as the level 5 variant but tack on a version. Such as a stronger liberator just being the liberator v2, because the devs have no creativity.
---
Love the idea of starting as a super mutant, but this game doesn't need a sequel
---
I have fast traveled to bots on parade and loaded inside the closed up bot stop pod before.
---
That, and it would be neat if the chickens could come out of the coop and wander around around your camp like Brahmin.
---
Nope. Sorry.
---
i thought the exact same thing today while browsing yt. perhaps he took some time off?
---
Sounds good. I'll message you around prior to the event and send out party invites once my friend is online too!
---
Hey I'm the fool that keeps playing so I have no room to complain lol
---
Maybe he took a break or has no new video ideas? I don’t know, but I’d like to know the real reason too. With the current state of the game I don’t know how any content creator would be motivated to create content on it
---
I've seen that suggestion, also. My main HD is too small to have this game on it. I use that ssd for Windows &amp; Office stuff only.
---
I have 76 installed on my d drive, which is a separate ssd I use just for gaming. This fix of copying the .ini file worked even though it's on a different drive.
---
It's always good to have alternatives, though.
---
Yep! I pick up anything and everything since scrap taking up my stash is no longer a worry.
---
The lack of updates to the F1st shop is annoying and frustrating. They really have us by the balls and sure are taking their good old time giving us anything besides a new outfit here and there.
---
The story's and game's current "end boss" is located there, but can only be battled if a nuke is dropped on her fissure site! Soon there will be a new nuke boss, and you'll notice them being dropped on Monongah Mine. A special event begins when this is done at either spot, and it starts a big ol boss battle the whole server can participate in!
---
That's a shame :( im trying to build an air ship and that would be the perfect joystick for the controls
---
I would like to have the skeleton with 76 vault-suit, or a enclave outfit or just different factions in general, who cares if you came from vault 76, the vaults dead and the people who are out their with you aren't vault dwellers anymore
---
They should just move Wallace over there. It's weird how he just stands in the middle of Harper's Fairy for whatever reason.
---
You’ll know as you progress in the main questline
---
Create your own team, boot people if necessary.
---
Awesome!
---
But he always did! That's the crazy thing here, he always produced something.
---
Annoyed about people complaining on Reddit, makes yet another post complaining about people complaining
---
And yet thousands of people keep playing every day.  Maybe just figure out that this game may not be for you.  They've sold over a million copies, the internet is just a megaphone for bad ideas.
---
Some people just don't seem to understand that. I've left my team many times because of people sharing this perk or the ones that heal rads. Making a thread to complain about it seems like such an entitled thing to do. Some people may share those perks to try and be a troll but you know what, there's also people who don't play a bloody build and actually like them. No reason they shouldn't be allowed to share the perks.
---
Yes its bugged don’t use it yet, you wont see your camp on the map, you won’t be able to fast travel there, you won’t sell anything in your vendor cause no one can see its there unless they randomly bump into your camp and your companion might go missing. Best to wait if they ever fix it but they definitely know about it cause my partner already asked bethesda.
---
I've noticed that a lot of Fo76 creators slowed down. captainoob just got back to his normal schedule, kinda.
---
Nope it has to be just like Eso Zenimax says so
---
The targeting computer pulls right and low.
---
That’s strange then, I like his channel and occasionally watch his videos but I don’t keep up to date with his videos. He’s a good content creator tho
---
😂👍
---
Same thing happened to me.  When the rollover happened, I was still sitting at 8/9.  I quit and logged back in, and it was 2/9, with everything but the NW challenge completed.  Now it's back to 8/9.  I tried doing a couple tasks, but that didn't do anything.
---
you forgot step 5, we raid the fuck out of your camp and steal every last drop of everything before nuking your camp for having a cringe pirate sign when we're no where near a an ocean
---
It wouldnt be that much of a grind in the first place if dailies and weeklies didnt auto complete. I've lost 4-6k score a week for the past 3 weeks because bethesda cant be bothered to fix problems like this. And another 2k today since they decided I didnt want to do my dailies. Some people arent burnt out because of the Legendary Run, some are burnt out and tired of watching the developers worry about things like double sided walls and the gold bullion bug, while the auto complete bug continues to to be a problem. I've had hardly any options to get through the run asides from grinding the ever living shit out of mobs and events.
---
take some time before you go there. nuking the fissure site prime down there triggers the scorched earth event which is the final quest.  
---
also, scorchbeast queen is a quaranteed 3* legendary and with the legendary you get nowadays for completing an event, its a 2 quaranteed legendary items drop plus nice xp and lots of other mobs spawning around it.
---
Happened to me for the first time today, gonna log on later and hope they change 😂
---
To be fair it’s not really clear in-game how to leave a team.  I missed it for a long time.
---
Add me up dude, I like the sound of this plan: Harryy ii uk, also have a friend who would be interested.
---
Not really, just 10 strength and the armours are deep pocketed
---
I agree 1000%. I don't run PA, because I want the STR for carry weight and INT for XP, from Unyielding. But I will be going back to PA soon, as I love to role play as a BoS soldier.
---
Lol. She always targets me.
---
I run away from crown and shoot her in the face only rifle conc fire (no tank killer). The newbie i playedcwith was asking if i hacked. No dear boy, just pissed off the queen. Fight was 5 min. Fun had by all. Imma launch two queen fights tonight. Anyone wanna see my theory in action? Ps4
---
No. LadyDevann replied to me on the official forums, but I haven't seen any follow-up.
---
How does a mule work?  Can you transfer caps to alts?
---
Well, I can tell you tomorrow afternoon. I am on the road atm... I just remember that the 3rd star is RW, which is nice because this axe is just one FU 👍😁
---
For both fireflies and frogs try the lake at the top right corner of the map with the crashed vertibird in it, I've been trying to get a deathclaw to spawn there for days do that I can tame it but 1/3 of the time all there i get are fireflies and frogs, if they're not there just server hop
---
Then you just let the bugs sit in the background and never do anything about them and just let the game still have issues. 
---
Bethesda only fixes things that benefits players quickly and fix the other things never while investing time and money into the ATOM shop. 
---
Is fixing the fast travel bug or disappearing meat piles or auto completing daily/weekly challenges low impact high investment, probably in your book. 
---
Look at other games that have a strong company that fixes every bug that comes around or has hardly any. Maybe Bethesda needs to train their people like theirs.
---
Appears to be shared credit for the creatures as well.  Played a match: killed a ghoul and injured a rad scorpion.  Another player, not on my team, killed the scorpion (bush wookie here).  Got credit for 2 creature kills when the match finished.  Didn't kill anything else the entire match other than another bush wookie who took my bush.
---
Thank you.
---
I've run West Tek during the day with a nocturnal rifle; the game really needs some more challenging content.  I do have a coulple of bloodied builds but it's either to fit character or because I wanted to grind out score asap. I have so many to try different stuff and flesh out characters rather than just being about special cards. Right now I'm running around in sailing gear shooting stuff with harpoons.
---
SS armor had a problem where the shoulders dont scale to the player model or body type.
---
Well there was computer simulations so why not do that for those kinda dlcs
---
On the flip side, what if a person can only play a day or two , but cant play enough to finish the weekly challenges.  Should they be assed out of anything?  You need to look at it both ways and not just the way that caters to your playstyle.
---
Thats a good idea, to remove the repeatable if it converted to atoms after the SCORE board is done.
---
If I remember correctly (and how could I not, being a 40+year old pothead with a history of head trauma) the pre season atom payouts were like 25 or 50 atoms per daily, so if each event paid out 10% of its score cost in atoms it would line up. 
---
Dailies would award 25 - 50 atoms, weeklies 100. 
---
In addition to making the repeatables not count for atoms, for balance reasons it would probably make sense to time gate the weeklies to the same time frame when it becomes possible to "buy" your way through the ranks. 
---
That helps reduce the number of people xp farming their way through the ranks through whatever means in the first week and then being able to generate a few thousand free atoms every week at least and being rewarded for nothing, without punishing the more casual players. 
---
With atoms themselves being gameboard rewards I'm sure that my quick theoretical is missing some wildly important balance issues.
---
Maybe vacation? *shrugs*
---
You’ve lost that much and are still the same level as me, who’s never lost a daily or weekly and completed every one and plays enough to get the xp repeat. U must live online
---
Don't really like this idea, I rather have more outfits or the return of the wattzrifle
---
99% of the time I am running g around in excavator PA cause carry weight is god when you don't have FO1st
---
That threat is scary, I just hope he doesn’t know where I sleep at night
---
Take my Upvote. And an award. You are absolutely correct fellow Wastelander.
---
This sub is going to be such a shitshow when the expeditions are released.
---
Is there a reason that you absolutely must finish the board?  Is there something you simply cannot do without or your character will be ruined?
---
They give you FREE rewards for simply playing the game.  There has always been a divide in those that play more over others that dont.  This will never change.
---
That sounds like a lot of fun! Role-playing is a great way to spice things up.
---
I didnt know I wanted this
---
10 carry weight for the deep pockets?  Do you have a high capacity backpack, or what kind of mod do you have?  Before I was switching up my build I was able to carry about 490 with high capacity backpack, full points in strength, pack rat, thru hiker, strong back, traveling pharmacy (all maxed) deep pocked armor, oh and marsupial.  That was the max I achieved lol
---
I have both. I’ve barely used the gauss shotgun but the damage is nice. The gauss minigun has awesome damage, but for me the ultracite 2mm ammo is just simply unsustainable... not only do you need lots of flux to make around 1k, one time I calculated how much the 1500 or so in my inventory weighed and it came out to 70lbs... which was the deal breaker for me :/
---
I don't really want to start a whole new thread to mention this, but a thought occurred to me, so I thought I'd just post it in this thread, and hopefully people can see it and give their opinion.
---
So... What if, instead of the current daily challenge system, we still got new daily challenges each day just like we do now, but instead of the unfinished challenges from the previous day being removed at the daily reset, they'd remain doable for the entire week? Then, once the week would be up, the system would just reset both the daily and weekly challenges.
---
This way the challenges would come available at the same pace as they do now, so anyone who's logging in every day to do them would get new challenges to do every day, but those who can't, or don't want to do the challenges every single day could skip some days, and could still do their "backlog" of challenges without losing them that week.
---
That would be a kind of a hybrid compromise between the current system, and just having weekly challenges.
---
Thoughts?
---
I did the private world, hopped right to deathclaw island and got the bobblehead on top of the hut.  Simple.  There are 3-4 easily obtained bobbleheads unless you farm them all the time then there is an item pickup limit in place that you have to meet before they can spawn again.
---
Just had it happen to me too, sent in a report. I want to know if i should even expect an email back with a solution
---
For the commenters saying he may be taking a break: I totally get it, the legendary run has been a grind and I've taken a few days to myself. 
---
I would just assume with him going more to Twitch that he'd still live stream there rather than YouTube because it's easier and it's live content rather than produced and edited content.  His YouTube has 10s of thousands of subscribers so I assume his twitch has just as many?
---
If you're seeing people playing FO76 all day every day, it's probably because you're playing all day every day.
---
I dropped 6 nukes yesterday I always park my tent in the middle of the field next to the building so she lands behind it  
---
Z__Rev__z
---
But you do read this sub, right?
---
They already confirmed the people leading the devs don't care for what people have to say in regards of changes for the future. There's also the fact 90% of this reddit is posts with actual criticisms and ideas on how to change the game for good, not to mention, you are exaggerating saying it's the community's fault when i would say 30% or less of the fallout 76 players are on this sub. To put it clearly, No, it's bethesda's fault for releasing the game in that state.
---
No, I mean I have 10 strength in my special build and yes I do have a high cap bp and nerd rage which gives a 5 strength when under 20% health
---
Her usually announced that stuff though.
---
Dailies are optional.  Seasons are optional.  There is nothing in the seasonable board you NEED.  They put the ammo converter early on.  Other than that, there is nothing that gives power or an advantage.  Its all cosmetics.  
---
Dailies are still optional.  Control your addictive personality.
---
....there is a literal lighthouse in the mountains a hop and skip away from vault 76. you really wanna use the "nowhere near an ocean" argument?
---
Fake post
---
I haven’t seen one violent night in like 2 weeks
---
Gotcha.  What kind of weapons are you perked up for?
---
so you can post "Bethesda I finished all weeklies in day one because they are so fucking easy and fast to do now I got nothing to do REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GAME IS DEAD YOU MF" nah it is fine now If you are lvl 50+ and got decent stuff you can do dailies in less than 30 min if you are new player you won't care about this and more about finishing story line this system is good If you can't open the game and kill 10 scorched it is your problem
---
I have no idea. I’m not on the dev team and don’t know what is involved in addressing those specific bugs. Do you?
---
And no game fixes every bug. There is always a backlog with live service products.
---
He just stands next to your bed, watching. Waiting.
---
Only all DLCs are free.
---
So nope. Not paying for something we’re already getting for free.
---
I literally did exactly the same as you the other night... battled through to the part right before you launch the nuke but had no ammo or stimpaks left and it got boring dying over and over so gave up.
---
I watched some videos last night and the hacker perk makes it so much easier so I’m working on getting that and some better guns, stock up on ammo, grenades and stims before I go again.
---
Will do! Is that your gamer tag?
---
It's not that other players don't know, it's that they unfortunately don't care. I try and tell people on my mic but I usually either get a confused emote or a thumbs down
---
&gt;o not play all day every day as I have a full time job. That being said, I didn't expect to be able to get to rank 100 and if I didn't, that would be ok with me because I understand that sometimes not everyone gets the big prizes without some effort.  
---
&gt;But because we want to keep bitching about not being able to get everything because it's not fair to the casual players... please... this can't get any easier.
---
Please.  Tell me what everything entails.  Are their perks locked behind the season?  Certain weapons or armor (not skins but actual craftable gear)?  There is absolutely NOTHING you NEED.  Do dailies and play the game like normal.  You will earn stuff.  If you dont get to the end, big whoop.  You probably wont use 99% of the shit thats on the board anyway.
---
So how many people log in on average?
---
Everyone remember we're in a global health pandemic. Personal time need not be questioned, there's likely a good reason.
---
I have bear arms for heavies, bandolier for weapons, the chems and food/water perk forgot what it is. I don’t bring a PA to get rid of the weight
---
yeah those guys just finished the race weeks (if not months) before the actually ending, and now they complain about the awful grind (which was entirely their choice), and of course they also complain because they have nothing less to do...
---
It's like when you give a bag of candy to a child, and he cry because he ate everything in one day. ;)
---
Well somehow, they can complainhere, for sure ;)
---
stop deflecting... it makes you sound stupid.
---
What's this about balls?
---
its the final part of the original main quest
---
surprisingly enough you won’t find many people that care about “okay dev behavior” here. I’ve said many of the same kinda things on here about what general ethics and shit and the amount of bootlickers that attacked me on those posts, like i just don’t say shit anymore. Speak with money, stop paying bethesda for a job done poorly.
---
There will more than likely be another S.C.O.R.E weekend too.
---
it just has drinks in it but one of those drinks (vintage nukashine) has a special effect that teleports you to a random location two minutes after you drink it
---
I've managed it solo, but it's a bit draining to do.
---
It's roughly - sprinting (and killing what you can as you go) to get the 25 ore ASAP.  (and repairing the turrets).
---
And then .. defending the rest of the time.
---
I agree that two would make it simple;  both take one side.  (and of course gather the ore)
---
I agree with you EXCEPT for the Gain a Level. If I log out at the wrong place in my level up (ie right after I level), I end up completely screwing myself over on leveling the next day, and then have to either give up on it or server hop until I find one of the two or three events that will actually give enough XP to make it happen. And even that is dependent on other people at those events not being one-shotting douchebags.
---
I see it pretty consistently. It doesn’t pop up as a notification but I keep an eye out for events in the bog
---
I use the Plasma Caster, it's only ever used cartridges for me... Weird!
---
2 minutes burns you out?  Just quit.
---
You fail to comprehend the entire point of the daily challenges. It's not about giving away free shit. When you get people to log in every day you're reinforcing and rewarding a behavior. People that log in daily are less likely to suddenly wander off and play something else. It's all about player retention.
---
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa now. Excavator can have a jet pack??? I never knew that coz I've never seen plans for it! And actually, the only times I ever wear a PA is to mine for lead or drop from heights that would otherwise kill me. It can have a jet pack? Now I need stuff more than ever 🤩
---
I think I tried that, but going to give it a shot anyway! Thanks
---
Ok cool.  Thanks for the help!
---
Its already a passive thing and piss easy.
---
Chew bubblegum (uh what lol?)  
---
Buy 3 items from a player  
---
Join a group
---
Most of the stuff can be done laughable easy with no thought behind them at all.  There isnt one daily that is hard to complete.  Most of them you can do in conjunction with each other.  Join group, level up, kill legendary, kill x mob can all be done at the exact same time.
---
Man people complain just to complain.
---
I got to the exact same point.  I would have got there in the end if I had enough ammo and stims.  This mission is a bit of a step up from anything else in the game when you’re solo/lower level
---
Respawns are based on a pick list of like 180 items. Ya gotta loot for things to show up again. When ya loot, it knocks it off the list and ya can pick it up again. It is not time locked.
---
I have a magic Junkies Explosive Plasma Gatling (with splitter). I'm well aware of how ludicrous magic weapon (and a legacy one at that) is.
---
It's just so boring. It feels like i'm cheating, and I've had it since launch month. I have really had no reason to log in, I've been in end game god-mode since launch lol. 
---
It just feels icky. Like I'm playing an unfinished Alpha game. No legitimate online game like this has a bug as insane as this for so long.
---
Nice. I think I hav a nukashine so I might try it out
---
Well i do that too
---
i think he means the animation uses cores
---
Just play the game and stop asking these questions and waisting of my life. I’ll never get back that 1 minute reading this crap
---
I'm just glad I got chickens
---
Ah, that makes sense. I guess they used the same sort of animation as the Gatling plasma on that case.
---
Have to have a freemium model.  Box price will simply NEVER keep an online , constantly updated game funded.  Period.  The end.
---
So do you want the box priced w/ paid expansions, boxed prices with what we have now, or just box price, no updates, and call it a day, move on to the next game?
---
question: are you killing creatures actually called "frogs", or are you killing radtoads?
---
for frogs, i usually find some in the pool near the whitspring
---
I have yet to find 1 tameable pet. Looked at the mappalachia random encounters map, never anything lol. Have had animal friend 3 for like 2 months
---
Nope, only roosters in that coop.
---
The point of the season is to play the game and quite obviously the end goal is to complete the board. I’m not saying that they owe us free stuff, (although a lot of people would argue it’s their responsibility to make the game fun and engaging with events and content, but who am I to say)
---
My point is, even if you did complete every single daily and weekly challenge, you still wouldn’t be able to complete the board without using atoms, and THAT is shitty design.
---
Same with the job. Gonna get to last day decide of i buy or nah. Nbd
---
If they did this, then people would cry that they cant commit the time to finish the weeklies.  Its mind boggling that people are seriously advocating for LESS OPTIONS.
---
I did not know that. Must be it then. Thank you so much for prompt reply!
---
Not being an asshole to a new player and just not typing anything is free, friend. And doesn’t take any time either.
---
Right now on a team, though herd ment description says otherwise, it doesn’t currently fall off at a distance.
---
As long as you’re standing or crouching on the ground, the queen will land.  Standing on top of a structure causes pathing issues.
---
same effect, different duration.
---
well rested - 1 hour
---
kindred spirit - 2 hours
---
lover's embrace - 3 hours
---
Dailies make sense because they want people to play daily. Making it so people don't have to play Daily is just not gonna be a thing if that's what they want. They could lessen it by adding maybe a bigger monthly challenge or an additional weekly repeatable like gain/spend x caps.
---
Or they could do like a rolling week of challenges. Every day they add a new set and you have a week to finish it before it expires. Then people who play daily can do them daily and people who play weekly can try to do all of them on one or something. Only bad thing about that is they would need to have like 63 unique challenges(if 9 a day still) or else you get repeats and you would clear multiples at the same time making it better for the weekly players overall.
---
I remember reading that somewhere.   I always end up just killing them tho.
---
You realize it's not claiming five workshops at once... Right? You claim a workshop. server hop. Claim it again. Server hop. Claim it again. Server hop. Claim it again...
---
And there are easily spawned events like Riding Shotgun with guaranteed legendary spawns that you can almost always have to yourself and take like ten minutes to complete and can then be started all over again after a server hop.
---
Apparently it's NOT incentive for long-term play since YOU'VE ALREADY BEAT IT.  You're pretty much at the point where you'll max out the system.
---
So your argument is completely nonsensical.  Good job completely undermining your own argument.  Thanks for the support.
---
Sad!
---
Herd Mentality only requires you be in a team. Your actual proximity to teammates doesn't matter.     
---
The Lone Wanderer perk does not work if you are on a team, again, regardless of proximity.
---
As long as it has an "!" and you finish the event succesfully, the notes are guaranteed.
---
I enjoy logging in daily. Most of the time the dailies can be completed in 45 minutes or less.
---
I have no problem with an extra option for those who don't log in every day but not sure how that would be implemented.
---
Cool. My first time going I was like level 9 and I more or less hid in the shed and took easy shots at the queen with a hunting rifle. I didn’t know if/when she Agros to me that would mess it up.
---
I think they are medical so: huge grav= a long graveyard shift. *I believe* im oof at heart and working on the rest so it took me a moment to grasp as well.
---
No, it's not preventing her from landing.   Bethesda took away the ability to force her to land by crippling her.   This has been a problem since Wastelanders, Bethesda has acknowledged it but they won't bother to fix it.
---
Certainly. I just hope he's okay. It's not complainy, but rather concern.
---
Nice. I’ll hav to grind some today then
---
Sounds like good times man,back when the legendaries flowed like wine,&amp; the monsters always had a place to spawn!
---
Wish I coulda been there...
---
It would be dope if we could get some sort of that happenin again.
---
So if I understand this correctly, you actually WANT COD players in fallout? The entire reason F76 is fun to me is that most players who play it actually like the fallout universe, instead of shouting "FOKKA UUU NUUUBBBB" to eachother...
---
Me and my brothers literally spent an hour last night finding low level players while wearing civil war dresses and Fasnacht Man masks.  We would star smacking each other with The Tenderizer, 2-shot MIRV each other and do the robot dance all in sync around them.  This game is what you make of it.
---
Some of us enjoy the grind of doing events and dailies but I understand those players who don't these dailies are for the people whom play this game religiously every day just because you don't doesn't mean that everyone is like yourself and don't just log in thinking everything should be available instantly so they can go log into another game , good things take time and effort to achieve but I also believe there should be monthly challenges to then everyone has something to work towards
---
Is it though? I’ve been told the acid dmg has been nerfed into the ground
---
Tents are irrelevant.   Since Wastelanders, it is impossible to force the queen to land by crippling her.   To post a thread complaining about the queen not landing and ignoring the real problem.
---
Having something in between (such as gain 1 coin per level up, scrap cards for 1 coin) would probably be satisfactory, but I’m sure there would still be people who feel that they missed out from all the swapping they did, not taking into consideration things like the bonus perk card packs we are getting from the SCORE.  I truly feel these extra packs are BECAUSE the plan is to scrap cards to get coins.  Getting the score reward that gives you 3 packs is basically giving you 15 extra points.  
---
The system was designed because people wanted ways to tweak their characters, I don’t think it was designed to full on change what your character is, that’s why a single Special point swap rather than a full on respec of your character. 
---
And what I mean by penalized is, if we were able to just easily change our character around and not have any costs (and really, 1 point from a level isn’t that that big a cost) then I would be penalized by playing other characters.  I should have just played a single character and done all the respects on them and saved my time grinding.  We’ve known about the legendary perks for a while. We’ve known that the intention is to use cards to get coins, similar to NW.  I’ve intentionally been building up other characters to build up a collection of cards on multiple characters.  If the ability to scrap cards is taken away and it was only based on level (which your 2 points per level comment, and comments made by others has alluded too), I still have the issue of having a glut of unnecessary cards on my character.  
---
We also still have to consider the pace that they want us to get. Yes, there is the whole “log in every day to grind” aspect, but beyond that they don’t want us to max out too quickly, its a system intended to last a while.  Many people are going to come into this with a couple of perks maxed out or close to maxed out and we’ll be in a good place for a while.  More SCORE seasons will come out, with more perk card packs, and we’ll keep grinding out those dailies of “level up” and people hopefully will max out a 3rd card by the end of season 2.  
---
I know a lot of players want the grind faster, but not everything we want is necessarily a good thing.  
---
And you’re right, not everyone starts the game knowing what they want, but really the first 50 levels aren’t that bad, and level 50 is when you start unlocking legendary perks.  You hopefully have some clue, and fixing them isn’t that bad if your’ still new.  It will take quite a few coins before you can even rank up that 1st card. You’ll continue to learn.  
---
And I understand the whole casual vs. hardcore thing, the hard core will ALWAYS be ahead and that’s fine.
---
They should raise the weeklies score rewards so you can get it all in a day if you want or do it over the week as your time allows and then use the dailies to supplement it. Like if you want to play every day and do the dailies they’re there for you... but the main progress would be the weekly quests.
---
Everyone has different time allotments and ability to play... forcing me to log in every day is not fun. I stopped playing Destiny for the same reason. I already have a job I have to be at every day.
---
Yeah i agree, just saying i dont see it as likely since businesses never see past the money
---
No. 
---
I’ve already paid thousands of atoms, they’re supposed to be using that money to fund the DLC. I’m not paying again.
---
The odds of her aggroing on you are very slim unless you’re putting out some serious DPS.  It’s just good practice not to be a precious baby hiding on a tent.
---
What HE said.
---
You just can't aim that thing.  I always try to nuke vault 76 to keep new players away from the game, but never seem to be able to hit it.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Also, Herd Mentality will work on a one-person Public Team.
---
You sure? Apparently it was from a table near spruce knob but it was glitched so you couldn’t pick it up
---
I quite liked that one he did as a concept when he and his friends sought out camps with ridiculously priced items and nuked them. He always offered the folks a way out but they all took the nuke.
---
There's another guy I came across recently, Lonevaultwanderer, he picks a topic and talks about it, gives his opinion and whatnot. I like him as he seems to steer clear of the whole politics of 76 and just focuses on the game itself.
---
That, I did not know. Kudos to that.
---
Very nice! I a risky saw a queen fight today from afar because so was over encumbered, but it was a great show to watch with the sonic booms and lasers being shot in the sky. Looking back I should’ve taken a picture.
---
I think each rank of the season should be tied to number of days logged in. Rank 1 = 1day logged in, rank 20 = 20 days logged in.
---
I think this would literally please everyone and allow players to play how they want. I currently don't really enjoy being forced into tasks I'd rather not do, especially when I have to play nuclear winter.
---
Oh so she agros based on dps? Cause if it is I def don’t hav to worry ab her agroing to me
---
Yeah just walking and saw the green effects of its sonic booms by the prime site area even though I was near the East tunnel
---
Either way it goes somebody's going to be moist.
---
"you know how hard it is to FIND coffee, much less BREW it?"
---
I don’t think those offline kind of mods are going to happen..
---
Think wow addon type
---
Some of them. The Powering Up events for the power plants don't spawn until someone runs by the plant, and a couple at Grafton seem to be that way too.
---
Yet here you are, complaining about me complaining about people complaining. Isnt Reddit a wonderful place?
---
I have had so many die or vanish Steven King has me on speed dial. I gave up looking for replacements after wastelanders added a bunch of stuff to the same event pool. It's almost impossible, unless you take a friend to look for a pet. Then they will find it on the first try.
---
I feel like it's 50/50.  (not sure the actual break down).
---
50% of the time - events spawn fast.  Basically - as soon as one Treasury Note event finishes (explanation point), another one is popping up.  So as I'm finishing Uranian Fever, a Lode Barring is popping.  Etc.
---
And then.. 50% of the time, it's slow.  
---
I logged on private server.  UF had just popped - 2 minutes.  First thing - I run, do that.
---
I then proceed to playf or about 25 minutes.  No treasury note event.  As I was logging out - a Free Range spawned.
---
so it does seem inconsistent
---
His last video was pretty negative on Patch 21 - he said he was going to take a little break and wait for fixes / real new content.
---
Yup, it’s the new popular serum to sell.  +2 to all stats?  What’s not to love?
---
Nah, I'll go check out what legendaries the LV14 mule has for sale for his LV 350 primary.
---
While i agree with this, i would still like dailies to do... Some people like logging in and having direction. Ive been playing since beta so sometimes i log in and go, "what the hell am i going to do today", and the dailies really help with planning that out. BUT idk if there is a good way to differentiate dailies you NEED to do every day compared to ones you have the option of doing. Perhaps dailies not giving score and just resources/aid/ammo/legendaries? I miss the challenges for survival mode that gave us some of those awesome weapons. RIP to my alt who is now my main and can never obtain any of them :(
---
I'll be done today or tomorrow.
---
Zero grinding.
---
People calling the challenges grinding shouldn't be playing the game.  It's literally 2 minutes of doing stuff you might not otherwise like split a purchase into 3 or craft some floor mats, and then doing what you would normally do, join a team, do an event, gain a level.
---
ZERO grinding.
---
Saying the 2 minutes of joining a team, taking a photo and making a vendor purchase "burns you out" makes you the most pathetic excuse for a human I could possibly imagine.   I'm sorry your mommy can't click the "join team" button for you since she's busy changing your diaper, but we all have our personal challenges to overcome.
---
As I said, I have no idea about the recipe or where does it come from.
---
Was talking about the paddle ball mods, those are frome the dev room.
---
Part of me says this is a good thing.  She's harder to melt when she's airborne.  Keeps the people with the hacked weapons from deleting her so fast.
---
mmmm spoiled veggies, I have the herbivore mutation and primarily survive off spoiled veggies
---
I just dick around with other players, mostly low levels, but I’ll do events, my dailies, farm materials, etc. as well
---
I've got, like, 40 of them. Time to sell, sell, sell!
---
The repair 76 weapons challenges will also become harder if enemies stop dropping low level weapons that are easier to repair
---
Scout bröther
---
Likely someone you were in a public/private team with, completed a silo while you were in the team, this can complete the quest for you.
---
You get the achievement from being the one to actually launch the nuke.
---
Yes, but like every sub on reddit everyone in them thinks they are part of this massive global majority, when really there at most a few hundred active and maybe a few thousand lurkers at the very most.  Just be cause you post here and people agree with you does not mean everyone agrees with you.
---
Yes, that one is a huge issue. After the lastest fix they implemented the issue was resolved for most of us. But I have heard of people whos problem has persisted. I feel ya, that one must be upseting
---
I 100% agree this would make it much more fun
---
Wow was popular and still has millions of players 
---
And this is about as much an mmo as gta is.
---
Idk man, I've had the queen land on top of a tent before. But also, I don't use the ground anymore, I have a camp in the sky that she lands on more than she ever did on the ground. Best camp idea I've had yet
---
Just out of curiosity, what do you consider the core issue?
---
Were you part of a team/public team at all? If someone within your team runs and completes it, you will get the credit for it even if you aren't there. I know my game completed it for me (minus the launch a nuke trophy) when I was part of a team pre Wastelanders. Was pretty bummed that I got the glory without even seeing the inside of a silo. I have since gone through a silo run and launched my own solo nuke so I guess I experienced in the end.
---
Yeah ran into a guy doing a similar thing but he had a hole in his floor which trapped you with punji boards
---
Chitlins is in the game at Spruce Knob Lake but its bugged and you cant pick it up. There is Mods that changes Plans and recipe from the paper object to a bundle of balloons or other 3d objects and if you use those you can get the recipe. So its kinda a Grey area.
---
At some point you were in a public group with someone who completed the quest (or was farming the queen, etc), which marks the quest as completed for anyone in the same group. It happens often, search the sub and you'll see tons of posts with the some story.
---
It does suck, amd it does drain the motivation to do it yourself, but you can still complete the whole quest on your end by looking up a guide on where to go and what to do, you just won't get the objectives guiding you through it.
---
 Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved  
---
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
---
They love that quad tesla to much
---
I like to toss them through the windows at Whitesprings Golf Club as a way to soften up the ghouls that eventually come streaming out
---
Yeah..... Some would call that engagement....
---
Youd have to check the scenario in wich someone buys their way through the entire pass and then does all the challenges if they end up with positive, negative or neutral atoms. 
---
I would say you should end up neutral, meaning you earn as many atoms as you spent in the first place.
---
The exploration is just amazing in this game. It's what I do with most of my time. I'm still doing the legendary run, so I do a bit of that, wander a bit of the map, bounce around to check out other players' camps, and loot all the random stuff I can carry.
---
The grind is the only reason to keep playing.
---
I mean, some of the fo4 creation club stuff isn't too far off thomas the tank engine...
---
I was so excited when the board dropped and it gave me something to log on for again after taking a bit of a break after Fasnacht grind (for pretty much zero reward I might add).
---
I'm at about level 80 on the board now and I'm so ready for another break already but I refuse to give up without finishing as I'm this close. But I totally agree, it feels like a CHORE to do the weeklies and dailies. Especially the level up every single day, the NW challenges every single day.
---
I've been grinding to finish the board so I can spend some time on Red Dead as I totally neglected it for FO. Working towards that fireplace door! But for sure, when it's over, I'm taking a break!
---
It's to start the quest to get the ProSnap camera. You need to find a dead tourist somewhere. You used to have to find it at one of a set of locations on the server, but now you can just get the current location at the personal terminal at the camp, as pointed out by others.
---
Finally, the market becomes more accessible!
---
Thank you so much! You are very kind.
---
It's only a visual bug, speed demon is not affected by class freak fyi.
---
Like 99% of them are duped so if you want one you are gonna have to be okay with it not being legitimate
---
I received the Achievement and quest completion from my (private) teammate launching the nuke. I assisted in in the quest, but I did not launch the actual nuke, and I received the trophy for it.
---
I'll live, though scarred nonetheless.
---
76 and quite a lot North and South are'shielded' from nukes so not too ruin it for new players.
---
Hahahaha fun analogy
---
Not really tbh. Unarmed and melee are some of the most powerful weapons in the game. I use a quad combat shotgun without any damage perks and it still kills high level scorched in a few shots. The robots in watoga are passive to you until you hit them enough times so they're basically free. The crossbow is the closest you can really come to a difficult weapon to kill high level enemies with, but it's still not hard if you get a decent perk loadout for it. Maybe pistols might struggle, but if you get a gauss pistol you should be able to one-shot sneak critical any of those enemies, even without damage perks
---
I don't know why this happens but I prefer burrows, which is more likely to spawn additional enemies (is this random?).
---
I have an armor piece that has the Chameleon effect and Sneak maxed. Stealthing is essential to playstyle. Make sure your Pipboy light is off or they'll see you regardless. IDK if effects stack or what but I've had enemies look straight at me and do nothing as I casually shoot them to death.
---
&gt; The record i heard was a single guy ate 15 boiled eggs for breakfast! 1 guy!!!
---
LOL that's nothing. When I was a lad, I ate four dozen eggs every morning to help me get large.
---
I know.  I was being sarcastic.  It's too bad, really.
---
I’m not somebody’s who plays exclusively this all day, but I guess it’s kind of like Minecraft in a way. There’s a bit of content, but the real goal is to make your own
---
How did I never know trump had a brother and how did I never know he had a job at Zenimax?
---
I don't believe PvP'ers know what they want - because they hated survival (and no one played), they hate Nuclear Winter, even though its the closest thing to what you describe, and their recommendations are all over the place.
---
I continue to recommend that they find some other game to play if they are so dissatisfied with the current state of Fallout 76. There are plenty of PvP / FPS games out there with survival elements now.
---
There is zero chance for atoms.  Even if they didn't want to hand them out because they want money, if they gave atoms they would open themselves up to legitimate complaints about being forced to grind.  Its why no other game with a similar system would do stuff like that, it's just stupid.
---
That makes sense, I've been joining a lot of public teams for the Legendary Run Dailies and have been joining SBQ events to get legendaries.  Thanks for letting me know about the achievement being tied to the launch, that helps explain the discrepancy and keeps me from trying to rush a side character to it.
---
So it's none of the public events with that exclamation mark where you can travel to without spending caps? I will keep an eye open, maybe I just missed it because it was not prominent enough.
---
This has nothing to do with fallout 76
---
Exaggerate much?  I don't recall ever seeing more than 3.
---
It probably would be affected if it didn't already reach the max speed cap, hope they up the limit to that one day
---
I wanna become the fast
---
🤣
---
Gravity bong. They just said they got off a shift.
---
Easy doesn't mean it's fun. The grind is easy and honestly that's part of the problem. There's no challenge. It's just a gnawing monotony every day. If there was a weekly to kill a Scorched Beast Queen or to kill the Wendigo Collosus then that would be pretty neat for the first few weeks but even that would get boring fast.
---
What they need is new content. The crux of a game like this is that there's new things to do. Paid cosmetics and such are supposed to support the game so that it can create new content. New cosmetic are NOT new content. This season has added no new content to the game. Just monotonous tasks.
---
that's highly subjective. case in point, personally, it largely detracts from the game and I'm playing half as much since the season grind started.
---
and as I've already established, I'm not alone in this.
---
I would be game for it. I personally have no interest in PVP but no reason an area should not be created for those that do as long as non PVP players are not constantly incouraged by daily challenges to go there 😀
---
May sound silly but does the team have to have members or can I be on a team on my own? If that makes sense? Lol
---
I get them on load screens sometimes if I immediately alt-tab out to do something else.
---
I haven't crashed while playing in a while though.  I suspect it's because I'm using different weapons, setup or something because it was happening on my alt a lot but now that it's leveled and uses different gear it's not happening.
---
Maybe you just need to be part of the silo quest to get the achievement.
---
I thought I had to redo the silo quest to get it, but that was also over a year ago, so I might be a little fuzzy.
---
Im not arguing, but I’m not so sure mate. It also has been affecting my carry weight and all the stats show it’s not working -4 until I switch perk card on/off, then it drops to -1. 
---
I hope your right honestly, but to me it feels like it’s not working.
---
Didnt even think about that. I actually thought they were just a fun cosmetic and was surprised it had a use.
---
Ah, when I made an initial search I hadn't seen anything recent so thought maybe it was new but the public team thing explains it.  The lack of objectives sucks but knowing I havent missed anything integral that can only be gotten through the quest helps.  Thanks for the advice.
---
Never heard of this or read about it. 
---
I’m thinking new maybe. 
---
But then again I don’t use the racks to put weapons on. I use them above workstations to look like tool racks lol
---
It would be 13 levels.  2000/150 = 13 with 50 atoms left over.
---
Ah. Hence Angry Turtles “Is Herd Mentality OP” video.
---
The trophy is supposed to be tied to quest completion, if I'm not mistaken. It sounds like OP got screwed out of it.
---
All this, 100%
---
Level 1 or level 50, both die in one shot, one just gives a lot more XP.  Bring it on.
---
Fair enough
---
I'm like not leaving, but not staying. Pretty much I'm just going wait awhile until more stuff is added and fixed like I did last year. It was worth the wait imo. I got a good few months of entertainment and starting a week ago, I'm going to kick back until they get everything together. Might wait until Halloween to log on for a week. That way I can catch anything cosmetic that looks spooky.
---
Anyways best of luck to you. Glad you enjoy this game. It's great in ways.
---
Implement a dark zone like area from division 1/2 and watch the salt accumulate.
---
I don't know... "brewed in the fire of a nuclear storm"
---
Or least it in a coffee pot at ground zero.
---
And not so classy either.
---
If you have nothing to play for, then you have literally no reason to keep playing. A slow grind allows a steady reward to be obtained while you continue to play other things.
---
It rewards your play, even if you don't get the rng rewards you desire. And once you finally have those rmg rewards, it gives you something more to work towards.
---
Correct.  Check watoga high school in the cranberry bog. Keep in mind this is technically a PVP event so even if you have pacifist on you can be killed.
---
Careful when doing atom challenges you may only be rewarded 1/2 of what it says you will earn.
---
Uh you can complete it.  I havent spent one atom and I am on 87.  I just do the repeatable and its easy easy to do if you know the exp route that you can google.
---
It goes back to it being optional and those with more playtime will always be able to do more than those without.  Its the way its always been and always will be.
---
How else would BGS encourage that area to be used?
---
Anything they had to the game is going to be predicated on making money - it would need to bring in new players &amp; general atom shop sales to justify the expense.
---
They aren't going to do it out of the goodness of their heart.
---
At QuakeCon, they did say they are working on something PvP-related. It could be a new game mode or even public PvP teams. We don't know quite yet what it will be, but I imagine it will be a low-effort, low-cost way to try to appease the small number of players (proportionally) who want to PvP.
---
Wait seriously?    Ive hit charleston for lead and stayed in the same aerver for hours always wondered why there was never a loot reset every hour or so. Guess this is why
---
I mean no disrespect at all. They are called rewards for a reason. It takes dedication (to the game at least) to log in every day and you are “rewarded” with the highest tier items for your dedication. If you logged in once a week and completed the weekly challenges, you would still receive some rewards. Obviously you wouldn’t receive the highest tier of reward but why would you expect to receive the same rewards as someone who was willing to spend more of their time or more of their money via buying atoms? I thank the people that play every day and I thank the people who spend their hard earned money supporting the game because I can’t play every day and I refuse to spend money on atoms. They would have shut this game down a long time ago without either of those two groups of people. I think those players have earned the right to have a few skins or wallpapers that I can’t have. Just my two cents.
---
I want legendary chicks too!!!!
---
Ok, thanks I couldn't find it.
---
Ward's shack on its site, and Ward still sitting in his seat, that's attached to the floor (now wall)?
---
It was a patch 21 bug - you can't put displays on walls right now.
---
I like the natural feel it has, good work!
---
TL;DR - just have friends to play together.
---
Sounds like a Developer problem, not a Player problem. How the fuck is some rando supposed to know the item they pay monthly to use specifically for the convenience of doing that exact thing creates a glitch that prevents the main boss from landing? Seems like something they should put in their schedule and get an engineer to look into.
---
It’s a metal rod stuck into a tire, under Floor Decor. It’s nothing special.
---
rad explosion mutation proc-ed
---
I have existing displays on walls that I can put other weapons on like fixer, handmade, Gatling lasers etc just not the assault rifles
---
Don’t use the crosshairs with the bow, imagine it’s real , the crosshairs are only good for centering after that aim the bow accordingly based on distance, the arrows arch once I figured out everything I never miss with it and I always one shot everything, just not the big monsters those need something with more umph
---
Probably a Patch 21 bug still.
---
Just figured I'd ask a question in a sub where other people like the game like me. Sorry for wasting your precious time.
---
Ya it took me 12 steel drops to never do that EVER again and I’ve been having the best time playing SINCE. 
---
Im 100% Not mad and im also NOT trying to get mad at Bethesda screwing all US players over. 
---
Hey thanks for getting me my free stuff KEEP DONATING PLEASE
---
Had someone nuke Morgantown today. God only knows why?
---
From my understanding and limited testing...
---
Herd mentality works if your in a one person team.
---
Stranger in Numbers and Empath both need a target for them to work, so they dont work in a solo team.
---
Lone wanderer drops as soon as you enter a team from my understanding.
---
Edit:for OP herd mentality doesnt have a range, lone wanderer only checks if in a group.
---
Well, it's the biggest forum where we can get a broad overview about the community's hivemind. Do you have any better evidence on what the community thinks? Anything? Or are you just talking out of your ass?
---
I'd prefer the challenges go away entirely and get replaced with new randomized daily repeatable quests (similar to ally quests) that award score tickets that work like treasury notes but with a weekly turn in cap instead of a daily turn in cap. Maybe also have all the existing events and dailies also award the tickets.
---
Then just put a machine at the train stations where we can turn the tickets in for score or for stuff like the vault tec supply crates instead, so if we've finished the season ranks we can still earn something for our efforts.
---
To be fair it took them ages to figure out that bobby pins weight pretty much nothing.
---
It's to activate the Scorch Beast Queen, and event Scorched Earth. However, you can drop a nuke just about anywhere. Honourable mention to nuke areas like White Springs to farm materials for Ultracite ammo.
---
Dude I want daily and I haven't had a chance in a week to get on. Im exhausted. Its gunna be harder when I'm back at work
---
I agree. I barely have time to do all the dailys and this is with more time on my hands. 
---
The dailys are a drag and not everyone can get on everyday. Sometimes I skip a day and do it in the morning before it refreshes. More weeklys instead would give people a lot more time to fit it in now with their own schedule
---
*in your opinion*. you're still arguing a losing point. it's become crystal clear that the mmo/mobile model does not sit well with a huge chunk of the Fo76 playerbase. whether you like it is irrelevant.
---
and it's just as baffling to me that you'd log in daily just to grind. it's insane. just as I'm sure you can't comprehend that I have reasons to log back in other than inane busywork.
---
The right handed bow is an animation and model consideration. It's the same reason loading actions are also on the "wrong" side for some weapons.
---
should've made the chicken's killable for chicken meat which is currently way too rare. Just like how you can use the brahmin pen to get brahmin meat and then repair it.
---
I noticed I started crashing as soon as I added the flaming bird statue or whatever it is, and people who came near my camp crashes or left and rejoined the party multiple times. I wonder if it's one of the new assets.
---
Just like the modern day shopping mall of the 80s and 90s that are now dead the Whitespring is no different. people have moved on to bigger and better things. As much as I would love to Make The Whitesprings Great Again, I don't think it will achieve the level of popularity as it once did in its heyday.
---
Everybody liked that.
---
I don’t know why you’re sucking Bethesda’s dick on this, but in my opinion you should be able to complete it just by doing the dailies and weeklies instead of having to grind out hundreds of thousands of xp points weekly. Grinding isn’t fun or enjoyable for everyone.

Yeah if a ghoul is on top of you the arrow phases right through them an that's just harsh.

3. The sights alone need an actual use beyond accuracy and the like.

THIS
---
With bullets and plasma - that's how I intend to "vaccinate" them.
---
Actually not sure why you are getting downvoted for this...
---
I mean, I get the OP's point, but if we just stop doing it, they will actually listen.
---
If they haven't given a shit about weekly vs daily by now, I doubt they will until either the player base just dwindles or no one is doing their grind.
---
Just remove the  "Level up" requirement, it's stupid and feels wasteful to ignore it
---
The board shockingly has nothing to do with gaming or entertainment at all. Idk if that's ok being a "parent holding company" or not but that's what it is.
---
Yeah I meant the animation, that's why that bothered me :D
---
Team alone works
---
I do play a lot yes. I'm sure you probably didn't mean for that to come off as an insult so I won't take it as one. But my friend who plays about as much as I do, and hasn't missed a single one, is about ten levels ahead of me. I just don't want to sit around forever being forced to grind out XP to be able to finish instead of playing the game with and enjoying the game with my friend who i bought the game for. 
---
But regardless, 76 is one of the few games I play alot, and playing it with my friend helps with my anxiety alot.
---
Farm Berry Mentats.  Everyone wants them and they are really not hard at all to make.  Use Green thumb/super duper/chemist, profit.  Of course you'll have to buy the recipes from MODUS in the medical wing of the whitesprings bunker if you don't have them.

Starlight Berries: Black mountain ordance and down the road to Point Pleasant, The Deep, Charleston DMV, Slocum's joe area both sides of river and east to beyond the tracks.  
---
To craft the Mentats: You need more Brain Fungus plus Firecaps and Carrot Flower.  Carrot flower is everywhere in the bog and also in the same areas mentioned with firecracker berries above.  There is a lot of carrot flower at the whitespring also.  
---
Firecaps:  Same areas as starlight berries, plus more at the Monorail Elevator and tons of them in the area west/northwest/southwest of vault 76.  I go as far north as the tyler county fairground and south to the Gillman Lumber Mill.
---
I've made 850 Berry Mentats in half a day and at 40-50 caps each they sell out as fast as I can make them.
---
it kinda sucks in my opinion. I loved doing leader of the pack so I could arm new characters with unyielding and bloodied gear.
---
The entire underground cave network beneath the road from Watoga to the abandoned town workshop.
---
Yep, I bet they will do something about fortifying ATLAS Bravo because people arent engaging much on Alpha
---
But oh well, Im not gonna delete the comment, I will leave it there see if I keep getting downvoted
---
This would be much better. Stop making gaming such a chore. If I wanted to do chores I'd clean my house.

It had a piece of cloth back in Fo1 and 2, I don't know why some 3D artist at BGS Austin decided not to include it.
---
I can't comprehend logging in if you have nothing to do. Why bother?
---
That is actually hilarious. Thanks for clarifying, appreciate it.
---
I dont know why you're such a whiny cunt thinking that everyone should get the same thing even though varying levels of effort are done.  Seasons in a majority of games , especially looter shooters / ARPGs like PoE, Diablo, etc are always play time reward based.
---
And youre crying about grinding, yet FO76 is a game literally based on grinding for fucks sake.
---
It's functionally an 8th SPECIAL, "!" that can use any perk cards up to a maximum of the rank of the Legendary Perk. This in no way affect the number of legenday perk slots you get. The intent here is a similar one to the +5 SPECIAL Legendary Perks that raise the stat up to 15, but instead of actually boosting a stat it gives you an 8th that can use nearly any perk cards for the builds that currently can use all the cards they should by design want to because of the current 15 point limit.
---
It seems like they did the same thing for the Gold Handmade skin as well. I think I’ve been waiting 5 months or so for that to get fixed?
---
I hope they sneak a fix for them into an update soonish.
---
YES PLS
---
Not at all. You’re ahead of where I should be and  it sounds like u don’t need the daily’s tbh
---
Hey I’m down to play, I’m a mere
---
Level 6 tho.
---
If you took regular RadX then that supresses all mutations
---
Otherwise idk, thats weird
---
Hahahahahahah im stoned and didnt understand the reference. Jeeeezus
---
10/10 would make the season way more enjoyable
---
i have found a legendary one before but it was just a random spawn
---
No limits, if you run out of bots just server hop and try again on a different server. Thats the quickest way
---
What if they're Anti-Vaxxers?
---
Syringer sniping?
---
New Daily quest, vaccinate 3 BOS
---
Of course not, the sealed environment created by power armor protects you from disease. Oh wait...
---
Exactly! If I could’ve got ahead that first week and not been gated by dailies I might have gave it a shot if I could put in a chunk and then take break, come back do another chunk etc. it’s still boring but I could probably have scraped together the motivation to try it at least if that was the case. I am not going to carve out an hour of every day of my life to do ridiculously boring and tedious challenges, and they said “it’s things you’ll do anyways while playing” well besides the challenges there is nothing else for me to do.
---
I have things to do. things that don't involve inane busywork. the inane busywork gets in the way of things I actually want to do, in fact. I'm playing half as much because I hate having to waste an hour doing my stupid chores like a child.
---
people play Fo4 and Skyrim religiously to this day. without mods, even. remember what I said? about a lot of people despising grinding/mmos? yeah.
---
Several people have. Thanks to the repeatable.
---
Quit browsing new dummy
---
Oh so it random encounters
---
"DID YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THAT CHICKEN?!?!?"
---
\-Cowboy, high on peyote
---
The problem isn’t that it’s “hard” it’s that it’s boring, unengaging and not worth it.
---
Tons of future updates that will be Delayed and still release with game breaking bugs*
---
Just a question what would you charge for ballistic fiber I'm getting ready to make a post about selling a bunch but dont know what I could ask with out asking to much
---
0_0 seems legit
---
At least you still have internet access on your journey back...
---
Best of luck to you.
---
The BOS hate circlejerk is strong
---
See, that's the issue, you view it as a chore. If you see challenges as a chore, maybe this game isn't for you. Challenges have been a thing since day 1, and complaining about them shows you don't want them, so you don't want to play this game. Maybe consider going back to FO4
---
Nope, that's what Nuclear Winter is for.
---
They need to beef that mode up, not saddle down Adventure with poorly matched features.
---
I'm level 98 and as soon as I hit 100 I won't feel the need  to log in every day which will be nice...
---
Sure I could grind some more gold but might as well wait for season 2 but now I know how many days I can miss I won't be rushing back.
---
I agree! It was fun to just craft away and see random people stop by. You would have people drop off gifts for other players, wave, it was a fun time.
---
I like to think in another universe where Wild Wasteland is a perk in 76 this is actually real.
---
Having the same problems , never was a problem before but I am running a high int character now.
---
As an aside there are some much quicker tadpole challenges  ..the ines where you photograph creatures can be done really quick... campfire tales will get most of the insects
---
It's a past time fueled by my desire to be tribalistic.
---
Not the best idea in MY opinion, but I see your point.
---
Crafting a level one crossbow would have been another way to go about it. Far less durability. Good luck with the badge grind
---
Nothing like a little radiation to make my coffee taste new and refreshing!
---
... I think.  It LOOKS like it tastes new and refreshing at least!
---
I don’t give a shit if my character doesn’t know who they are, that’s why he hates them
---
I see you're a cup half empty kinda fellow. Yeah, I assume you've already run out of fun. Shame.
---
Looks great! Always love players that create fun and interesting designs for their camp. How long did it take you? :)
---
Because they didn't played the original games...
---
Except for they suck in west Virginia too.  Techno Raiders are all they are.
---
Macho Man Randy Scorchbeast!
---
CACAW, mother fuckers!
---
Maybe fo76 should be using more creative/engaging gameplay loops then, because judging from the myriad of posts recently, a lot of people are fucking tired of the endless grinding. What is even the point of playing a game if not for *fun*? And more casual players probably aren’t completing every single daily and weekly, so finishing the board would still be a reward for players who dedicate more time, but as it is, grinding out xp for a frankly abysmal amount of score is neither fun nor engaging and from where I’m standing, is a cheap move to motivate people to buy atoms.
---
I’m subbed and it shows up on my feed, I love fallout, and WANT this game to be good. I agree with OP but wanted to add that that alone wouldn’t be enough the game needs new content plain and simple, and not 6 months+ apart. Don’t act like an idiot.
---
Yet they've modeled an exact replica based on it, minus the cloth.
---
&gt; All the good devs are working on Elder Scrolls 6.
---
oh so nobody is working on ES6?
---
you've been arguing the same point for over 12 hours now. and now it seems we're going in circles. I can literally just quote my first reply in response to that:
---
&gt;yeah, that's the point. the Fallout playerbase wants, well, Fallout. not 'baby's first light mmo with mobile time gates everywhere to inconvenience players as much as possible, because we can't come up with actual content since all the competent devs are working on TES and Starfield'.
---
&gt;whether the story, lore or quests are good is irrelevant and highly subjective. the point is that a lot of people never wanted Fo76 to be a mmo to begin with. all this stupid busywork does not sit well with the Fallout playerbase and it shows.
---
That's a good point actually! Haven't come across a mule account like that so haven't thought of it
---
It is easy to make too.  Ash rose is on the rooftops of Lewisburg, Kaleidopore is in Arktos and bloodleaf in every river especially flatwoods.
---
I ran out of fun the second people ruined the game by duping. You’re r/Hailcorporate material
---
I've never visited a profile page with negative karma. You're a first for me my friend.
---
My character already hates them simply because of Fort Defiance. They lived in there and didn't clean it up at all. Junk everywhere... They didn't even throw out those old red dresses. For being former military their cleanliness left much to be desired.
---
AD VICTORIAM o7
---
No I understand, just giving a potential explanation for the slowing down of any content creator, really. Concern is good, it's human nature.

Yesterday I went to farm xp, in an hour and a half with 100% bonus xp I was able to get about 700 score, which is about two and half actual character levels for me. The weeklies would have been about 4, maybe 5 levels, and dailies would be a help aswell, because I don't get the same consistent xp every day because it depends on what we do everyday when we play. Some days I struggle to get level up and have to get on when I first wake up and grind out the level up before reset before I get started with what I have to take of in real life. 
---
In order for me to get it just from the XP I would have to spend just about all of my time doing an XP farm, which is a big drain on my resources from a significantly higher than usual amount of ammo being spent, and a drain on my will to play, because just farming mobs constantly is the most boring thing to do, especially when in an hour with 100% xp bonus got me about half a of a level.
---
My only thought is maybe once the Brotherhood actually arrives, they’ll add a legit banner? If not, this is just another waste of space at my camp.
---
Pfffft.
---
I’d be okay if this was actually the quest.
---
I would love to have that kind of humor in this game.
---
Would make a new char just for this if they ever implemented it.
---
Someone just nuked atlas observatory in my lobby
---
Shotgun, totally. Multiple projectiles, devastating power, surprisingly not shitty range, decent reload speed, and only one 2mm EC per shot (frugal on ammo)
---
I named my Instigating GS "Boomstick"
---
I, like my character, have no idea who the BoS is or why they're so hated lol
---
Zip to do with '4th wall" crap. 
---
My characters hatred of all things PoS BoS is simple - he's listened to the decoded message...
---
"We come in peace, and if you don't like it we will kill you'
---
Bethesda has got a communist present for our fellow comrades next season. Just wait and see lol
---
That... that is an option, I suppose. If you’re going that route, I suggest you set up some artillery.
---
Class freak has been work fine for me.
---
Man I thought I was the only left who thinks like this. Great write up.
---
If only... if only.
---
RadRoach didn't want you moving in on his turf.
---
I have no clue how much damage or rads that mutation does
---
So  a lot of value for a lot of effort? That is fair. But i disagree. A paintjob will make you happier for a few minutes, it is simply not worth it.
---
fo76's building system is very annoying, I think your issue is there is no base for that wall or floor above it. You could try adding a floor above it but it probably won't look how you want. The whole "inaccessible" feature is annoying, what does it really stop? Someone with a bounty chilling in a hard to reach place?
---
GT is stoicpanda1419, would love to run this a few times tomorrow morning, say 8:30AM EST
---
I think you can only have one or the other
---
I had one spawn under the bridge after the hotel in flatwoods, was about a year or so ago.
---
Around 5 days and completely reworked it once
---
You can't have both. Whichever you have first will block the other.
---
I started encryptid when no other events were happening and no one showed up I was very disappointed
---
If only your comment included a /s then perhaps it would be more clear that you indeed did know how to leave a team.  But it didn’t so one would naturally assume that you didn’t know.
---
&gt;Less than 30 minutes for all for sure.
---
X DOUBT
---
LOL the ole bulk concrete run.  It is like a rite of passage when you reach that point where you realize there is nothing left to buy.  I used to go to player vendors looking for a cool weapon, but usually only lead pipes and nocturnal commie whackers were found.  Now when I get close to the caps limit, I'll go purchase 20K worth of stuff from any low level who happens to be in his/her camp and then drop the stuff on the ground at their feet.  Often I can clear out the entire vendor for 20K.
---
that type of wall attaches to the top of walls, not bottom
---
Just the few holotapes we hear about them in the game gives me more caution than I have about the enclave.
---
Remember the ecological balance daily.  She (forget her name) died trying to keep that air/water/soil data from the BoS.  
---
They ran Free States out of thunder mountain under threat of violence.
---
Every faction had a reason to dislike them.  Everyone one of my characters, soft-RPer that I am, has an active reason to dislike everything they’ve seen about the BoS.  They are not a likable faction which is what makes them a great part of the FO universe.
---
Happens to a lot of people and has been since beta and recently one of the most daily reported bugs on this sub. For those who find this post I'll reiterate some techniques to fixing it:
---
Log out 15 mins prior to 12pm est and log back in 15 mins after. (1145 out. 1215 in).
---
When logging out prior to challenge resent never leave the game from NW. Always leave from adventure.
---
Do not check anything until loading into adventure after reset. No atom store. No legendary board. No social menu. Do not log into NW first after reset.
---
Do all of your dailies prior to doing the NW daily (if at all).
---
Rub your head pat your stomach and hop on one leg. Do not skip this step.
---
I finished the board game a few weeks ago and hadn't had one challenge bug using these techniques. It may be all a myth doing what I did but losing that many challenges wasn't an option. Good luck!
---
Wouldn't surprise me they've delayed it
---
I already tried with a floor. This is idiotic, i cant stand how frustrating the building is in this game
---
They'll tell us about it on the f76 forums  on their website.  Usually posted by valseek
---
If you move your camp a few times, the budget comes back.
---
Huh? It cant attach to the top of walls
---
So maybe just go then?
---
The only way my audio works is with headphones plugged in. None of the tips and tricks to fix it have worked. Bethesda ruined the game
---
That's not there either :-)
---
Well yeah!?! Who doesn't want to drink Nuka "my blood is in it" Cola?
---
The best part of waking up
---
Is fallout in your cup!
---
76 was the first MMO I have played since it started.    
---
WoW was the other one but "The Lich King" was the newest expansion when my cousins got me into that back in 2008. Just b/c a company has one successful MMO in a different genre doesn't mean Fallout will 'fit' as one right away.    
---
I still have issues with it but I enjoy it enough to keep playing. IMO, after you have a level 100 char, you should be able to create other characters at level 50. That eliminates the grind and doing the SAME quests or relying on other people and their schedules to level another character.
---
If a lot of people are unhappy with something, they should post it. You don't have to read these posts.  
---
Maybe something will get adjusted for the next run
---
Happened to me yesterday for the first time as well. Lost 4 dailies (one worth 500)
---
Hey, I have jumped into NW for the daily, hopefully catch you another time?
---
I seriously hate daily quests. They seem like they arent worth the reward half the time
---
This would ACTUALLY motivate and excite us. Even like 10 atoms lol. Or like 3 challenges for 5 each? What would a fair hypothetical exchange be?
---
Wait, does the radio affect stealth?
---
Biggest disappointment was the lack of a wandering chicken tbh
---
I've had two within two days and always when fast traveling. No freezes thank goodness.
---
LoneVaultWanderer is a community manager for Bethesda, I could see why he would steer clear of politics. I watched him a lot before he became a community manager and he took a long break from making videos to focus on that.  I always enjoyed his content.
---
Personally not a fan of chameleon because of that temporary visibility, that is the biggest advantage of the stealth armor.
---
I had always thought harder to detect stacked, would actually make more sense by the description to stack than chameleon since chameleon is blending in with the environment rather than specifically harder to detect. Though Fo76's descriptions have a tendency to not be accurate at face value.
---
As long as they have cheat mods so I can just spawn in a bunch of scorched and just kill them all, I don't fucking care lol
---
I love this reference.
---
This is baileys....
---
This is Bailey's a bit closer
---
\+1
---
Also NW challenges are poo poo and unfun to complete...
---
lol,  had this happen the other day except he was playing the mouth harp thing.  loved it!
---
i thought by me saying you couldn't message someone may have been a hint but alas it wasn't
---
What do you expect from a survival looter shooter?  These games are designed to be grindfests from the start.  That is literally the game.
---
Grind dailies
---
Grind weeklies
---
Grind events
---
Grind nukes areas
---
Grind legendary mobs
---
Grind scrap
---
etc
---
Its in essence what FO76 is.
---
Thomas the SBQ any%
---
Paladin Taggerty specifically ordered them to take supplies from the Responders "and don't take no for an answer"
---
They are the origin of the shoulder pads of the 80's.    
---
Don't knock it until you try it.
---
Because they give people what they want.
---
Yeah. They do..
---
A simple sampling of some of the holo recordings left behind by the First Responders give me enough reason not trust them.  
---
I will await Modus's orders or suggestions before acting against them openly.  But they already have a tarnished track record in my book.  
---
As a General and member of the Enclave, the notion of former military personnel using stolen military hardware to do with as they please with no oversight is a dangerous situation that will only hinder the rebuilding of America.  I am sure Modus will see this presented danger and have us act accordingly to remove this and other roadblocks towards the peace and prosperity that a reborn America can bring to us all.
---
Sincerely,
---
From the Commander of Enclave Outpost Lamda

How did they ruin the game? Tons of people are continuing to have fun and new players are hopping on every day. I'm not advertising the game, I'm explaining why little shitheads like you are wrong. You're mission here is clearly not to have or encourage fun, so why are you here? You're part of the whiny group who bring all of their complaints to other people and try to shift their opinion or taint a first impression instead of being proactive and submitting a ticket to someone who actually has the power to do something. They patched the dupes, loads of dupers got banned or had characters wiped, sure it took a little longer than we may have wanted, but it was stopped. Sure, it may happen again, but it will be stopped. Those dupers don't MAKE you use their duped items, and no one is stopping you from playing legit and having fun but yourself.
---
On behalf of the Church of Mr. Pebbles, I welcome the Legendary Clucker to the wasteland.  Long may she reign over her coop.
---
"They are not a likable faction which is what makes them a great part of the FO universe."
---
Absolutely!  They are more interesting that way.
---
i put here, if maybe you want to farm them.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1U9tCksrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1U9tCksrM)
---
edit: and if you can't start the quest you have to change server.
---
Because it's the only Fallout game we're getting for another 5 years?
---
It was the last trophy I needed to Platinum, so I was happy to reach it. But as far as gameplay and endgame, it was business as usual.
---
Food that provides stats and bonuses that people need.    
---
You can find a list on the wiki of what foods provide bonuses. Your profit margin can't be too low or too high.
---
Yes of course. Feedback is always important. But as I said, the season is weeks away from ending. If you bourned out finishing the run then the devs cant do much about that now can they? 
---
If you want to complain about individual challenges like the bobbleheads one then yeah, that helps, they might do something about that. But I think the amount of SCORE needed is fine given how much we get from challenges.
---
better yet, remove the bloody battle pass!!
---
We already have artillery on high....it’s called the KOVAC.
---
I love the look of the armor, seems to be an unpopular opinion though. It reminds me of the old style of Power Armor, before it became far too gigantic.
---
I did mention that option in the post you replied to.  I chose the other option though, for now.
---
[I understood that reference](https://youtu.be/yNaTZV8qS1I)
---
&gt;	but alas you cannot
---
That statement in your first comment kind of indicated that you really didn’t know.
---
What's above it?
---
Came on here to post the exact same thing!
---
Done with my weekly and now I can't do my daily...this is horseshit.
---
I received a reply from support that they "couldn't" add SCORE and to submit it as feedback, which doesn't get a follow-up.
---
And I have specifically stated elsewhere that alot of people do want fallout mmo. And continued on with the fact that people like you are doing nothing more than trying to take away a game many of us have been waiting for for years.
---
Again, this game isn't for you, go back to FO4 and enjoy that, while I and my friends enjoy this. Don't ruin this for us because it doesn't fit your narrow gaming style.
---
Well I'm down, but we are planning on starting 12am est. My friend won't be up, but I'll message you and invite if youre still good to go when we start up
---
It's not fixed sadly. The most recent update actually caused my first autocomplete since week one when doing everything correct to be safe still.
---
IMO it should provide both.
---
You are so right with the shoulder pads!  I am an 80’s kid, I went through the football player looking sweaters.  Lol
---
You need to place a floor next to it and then a small angled wall under it. Then you can place that wall. Once in place you need to support it with a roof or floor on top before you can delete the small angle and floor below it.
---
A half wall, ive tried a full wall as well
---
Isn’t a cornivor  and herbivore same thing. Both eat corn.  Lol.   Carnivore is meat.   Sorry had to do it.
---
/thread
---
Supposedly the fix is to get to a server where the quest hasn't been turned in recently or something.
---
For the record, I had this issue last night. I fixed it by relaunching the game, leaving my group, hopping in, making my way to the centrifuge, selecting every menu option on the terminal other than the centrifuge, installing the fuse, then starting up the centrifuge.
---
YMMV
---
Umm how do you place ramps in a "stair step pattern? How does that look?
---
Is that even fun though? I disagree that the main aspect of the game is meant to be grinding.
---
Tbf you still all have the same amount of time being invisible and also immune to damage, and that only begins counting down once you have access to your character
---
So if other have spawned in before you just gtfo, it's hard to keep track of a cloaked enemy, so they shouldn't chase you for too long
---
Look for places to drop down, changing your elevation is a good way to escape
---
I just want to tag onto encryptid.
---
Did it as part of the storyline but never got a fixer plan 😕
---
...and to that I'll just quote my second reply, because we're literally going in circles now.
---
&gt;it's not as simple as that. first, yeah. there are a lot of people who genuinely wanted a TES or Fo mmo. but are they the majority? no, far from it actually.
---
&gt;and second, like I mentioned to another user, Bethesda is to blame here for misleading people, advertising Fo76 as 'play however you like' and conveniently forgetting to mention that you'll have to deal with the mmo bs regardless.
---
&gt;ESO was advertised as a mmo. period. and so the part of the TES playerbase who disliked mmos never touched it, because it was a mmo and nothing else. it was advertised as such. and the people who did like mmos and embraced ESO for what it was, knew what to expect. they knew how to manage their expectations.
---
&gt;this is not the case with Fo76. part of the backlash the game got on release is due to the fact people came in expecting Fo4 with friends, but instead got to micromanage their micromanaging. believe it or not, a lot of people despise mmos. and Fo76 is proof of it.
---
c'mon man, we've been over this. if you're not going to add anything new to the discussion, why bother replying in the first place?
---
Who downvote this? The PTS forum isn't there
---
I'd still pay 76 atoms for a interface mod that makes the super cramped UI closer to something like [SkyUI](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/3863-3-1436880046.jpg). But I figure a store chuck full of paid community-made weapon skins is closer to what we can expect.
---
Theoretically yes... But depending on how it all works you can still end up with under leveled legendaries as mole miners max level is 40, and mutant hounds max out at level 20something. There's always level 40something mutants among max level mutants as well.
---
I think it is what we make it.  I find the game fun but i dont do a ton of grinding, but I dont have secret service armor, or a bloodied fixer because im not grinding script / notes 24/7.
---
The main core gameplay loop and mechanics is grinding though.  Thats what this game is.  There really is no debating that.  Division 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile.  They are all cut from the same cloth.
---
I leveled all of my characters mostly solo and with ease. Two of them long before public teams. The right consumables and perks can go a long way, and just playing the quests, which you'd end up doing anyways, does most of it for you. The grind is part of the adventure, and it never feels any less rewarding to finish off a build and begin turning your character into the ebony warrior of Appalachia.
---
I also want to point that you can neither display assaultron heads since last patch. You can, but they are just invisible
---
Il do you one better shouldn’t Bethesda update the plasma cores model so it doesn’t look like a fusion core
---
try removing it altogether, placing the slanted wall, then putting the wall above it back.
---
Have you tried placing a roof that has the same angle?
---
Try adding an extra floor tile, add a half wall to the tip of that, then add the angled roof, and then try and add that wall on top of that 
---
And then delete everything it lets you
---
That’s not the point, people spawn in before you, sometimes you spawn in and a crate that’s in front of you has already been looted
---
It was not
---
"Disappointing but somewhat useful"
---
I've found my new Tinder bio
---
Again, it might help the next one. Just like complaining about double walls got them to at least acknowledge. 
---
Complaining about the game and complaining about complaining is all complaining
---
It still uses your stash weight limit tho
---
They have earlier access to weapons is the issue, I'm assuming.
---
The assault rifles show in the list as being on the wall rack but they are also invisible
---
Again, stop trying to ruin this game for me, and go back to your own game. If you don't like this game, go play ones you do like.
---
There are so many crates around, ans there are so many options to hide it's not as big an issue as people think imo
---
I asked this on the itv thread yesterday and one of the community managers replied saying that events like leader of the pack will scale. I wasn't too hot on one wasteland originally, but the more I think about it it will probably breath new life into events hardly anyone ever does.
---
that's not an argument.
---
Ill try that
---
I assume you are already done meanwhile?
---
They thought they did too... turns out they forgot.
---
Yeah so go find another crate, there are sooo many in this battle royale compared to others 
---
It really isn't as much of a setback as it feels like at first
---
I didn't feel like i had to add /s to what was obviously a sarcastic reply.
---
I would understand if i hadn't mentioned the message part because i'm pretty sure everyone knows you can message someone.
---
Yup which is why raider-lite and settlers are so boring.  Not so bad guys and good guys.  Zzzzzz.  If they set up BOS to be antagonistic to both they’ll regain some storytelling respect from me with this next story update.
---
Raiders frankly don’t make any sense.  They’re nice killers that farm?  The whole point of the Diehards, which is who they are in essence, was that raider line of thought doesn’t go as far when everyone is desperate.  Wish they’d explored that more.
---
Settlers would be more interesting if they had more of an equipment/what we’re doing here is more important than the individual mindset.  Like if you break a portable power pack because you’re stupid, you get exiled.  However that doesn’t fly with Ward’s daily...
---
Jerks
---
Jeez that’s not the point, everyone should have a fair shot by starting first, if you spawn in an area and it’s already cleaned out how is that fair? 
---
Plus the people that are in first get access to the better loot and you get left with a pipe pistol 
---
Everyone should be static until the entire lobby is ready to go
---
If you’re on Xbox, use the Xbox looking for group feature. A lot of people doing queen events together, or just looking for friends to play with.
---
after f..king long day with two electrical outages (lasted for 2+ hours and for 20 min), and other stuff, I so wanted to get a look at PTS... Only to find out that Forum category is not there, and it's not available in Bethesda Launcher. Hell :(
---
That works as well, though a barrage of five artillery would do just as well for less.
---
No idea, he or she is downvoting all the comments in this thread lol. Todd, is it you?
---
Anyway, I suppose the forums will open when the PTS is out. So the real question is, when is the PST coming out?
---
For being former military myself, the thought that militaries are supposedly always clean is funny to me. Especially in a warzone place like Fort Defiance was.
---
It works, it's just a visual glitch that doesn't show the correct numbers in stats. Its working fine though. Swap it out and in if you want the peace of mind that it's working I guess.
---
Ah, but when you care to send the very best, accept no substitute.
---
You obviously don't like the game and the direction it's going in.
---
I obviously do like the game and the direction it's going in.
---
If you change the game to be more like what you want and less like what I want, I won't play it and I have nothing else like it to play.
---
If the game continues to change in a way you don't like, you won't play it but have many other options to play that are what you like.
---
Stop trying to ruin this game for me, just because it doesn't fit into your narrow gaming style.
---
And then there’s the issue of stimpacks, if everyone’s already looted the area, there’s no meds, again leaving you at a disadvantage, it’s about fairness
---
I might be able to get in earlier so just msg me.
---
Someone needs proof lol

---
Thx alot!, will check out after the weekend and report back
---
Next Tuesday.
---
So you read the Patch notes but not the Inside the Vault? Or this subreddit? Curious choice.
---
Cobalt flux and plenty of ghouls to farm for mats.
---
I'd be up for it, maybe it should be an island where you have to cross bridges/tunnels to get to it. As you are crossing a warning comes up but there is a stash box and scrap box at that point so you can dump stuff before you enter and off you go or turn back. Could be a good place to really test your build.
---
Does next Tuesday finally include Colos prob?
---
You think that witty comeback makes you look *more* mature than me?
---
The Enclave / MODUS is well aware of the BOS. Remember, they mutinied before the bombs dropped.
---
Personally, I really hope we get the opportunity to kill each and every one of them who dare set foot in Appalachia.
---
Been wondering this also, couldn't see him getting burnt out because he always seemed so positive and excited about the game. Remember how hyped he was about the legendary run.
---
Remember when people complained about scrap kits being pay to win? Those were the days.
---
1230 hours in .. 3 level 200+ characters, 1 level 160 and a new level 60 that hasn’t done the main quest line yet... so much to do and experiment with in this Game
---
I read subreddit a lot.
---
Must have missed my gaze.
---
Lvl 505 with 2100 hours in the game. I've seen that more than a few times. From the front of Drop Site 9 all the way to the tree line behind the field back of Drop Site 9.
---
There’s a raider camp in the northeast corner of the map. North west of the lumber mill. Fast travel to the raider camp (can’t remember the name, sorry). From the spawn point run due west and you’ll find a little tree stand that’s well lit with some really cool glass jars. There’s usually 10 fireflies there.
---
Framerate or ping problems? If it's framerate, then likely PC, if it's ping, then either your internet or serverside problems
---
That's what she said, sorry I had to
---
He complains about ‘stupid questions’ but posted his own incorrect and ‘stupid’ comment about Class Freak, lol.
---
Fair enough. Thanks for the info.
---
They added her limb damage immunity to the code with Wastelanders. They’ve since said it was “unintentional” and that it’s “hard to fix” and they’ll try to have it ready by patch 22, but somebody had to physically add the code to begin with
---

Does it keep the food fresh longer?
---
Bet add me and we can play when I get on tonight
---
Epic gamer moment. Living proof that all the people who bitch and whine are just lacking creativity.
---
No you do a fine job of that all on your own
---
I don't think they are pay to win. It's providing no extra benefit to armor or damage.
---
Count me in!  GT: Psilenser
---
I'm on the west coast, so -3:00 hrs from EST.   Earliest available is 8:00 AM PST (11:00 EST) but afternoon / evening also works.
---
Ah lovely.
---
Been waiting on it for that triple head stand furniture I saw in build mode
---
Yeah. I don't plan on having a huge CAMP with every item I have access to build.
---
I use them at radiation rumble and line in the sand to guarantee I get a hit on enemies when I can’t tag them all.
---
But when you've finished all content over the 3(?) Years the game has been out, this is literally it to do.
---
Just updating you, got refunded my atoms today.
---
Literally all the evidence they provided was a "trust me bro, it's bad." So yeah, for all the other factions knew, they weren't, hence "pretense." Especially since the supplies being demanded weren't just excess things or even tech, but the last bits of food in a larder or the ammo and weapons they needed to fight the very present - and currently only confirmed - threat of the Raiders.
---
Also, I wouldn't say the Brotherhood was the only faction fighting the Scorched. That devalues The Firebreathers and the vaccine the Responders created as well as the Free States' tech wizardry to actually contain them. Both of those factions were far closer to beating the Scorched than the Brotherhood and they didn't even have a warning.
---
The Brotherhood's last attempt to beat the Scorched was going to be what we tried - a nuke on the Prime Site - and that clearly didn't work. Meanwhile if the Responders had literally a couple more days the main threat of the Scorched - their disease - would be eradicated, which would allow the Firebreathers to continue their fight - which was just as effective as the Brotherhood's. And the same goes for the Free States - a little more time and they'd have been able to set up the pylons that would act as Scorched magnets, which would've prevented them from spreading, and then they could've finished their deterrents, which from the sound of it would've made Scorchbeasts nearly harmless when combined with the attractors.
---
Of course, if you meant "at the time", then that's even more laughable because that was their own choice. It's not like they bothered to actually tell anyone about it; bit hard to fight against the Scorched when literally the only thing you know about them is that the Brotherhood are robbing you to fight "something bad".
---
The Brotherhood were valiant warriors and fought bravely to protect everyone, but they also didn't tell anyone about what they were fighting and demanded people just do what they say because they knew what was best. Being right doesn't wash away the fact that their pride and hubris was what caused Appalachia to get flooded with Scorched in the first place.
---
I'm on PS4 and for me public servers have become really laggy, private works just fine.
---
For me, grinding is NOT an adventure. A lot of time spent for a TINY amount of progress is not worth it. Doing the same thing over and over and another thing over and over is boring.
---
You know what I would love.  For Bethesda to hire one of the modders. They would bring the fix it mod community to the game. 
---
Sure you have to pay them, but that one person would bring the whole mod group with them. “Look at me I work at Bethesda guys, now we can get stuff done!” 
---
No training, no this is the code, just let them bring it all together. One salary to someone who can bring it all together
---
We know this game makes money. I love playing it so I can chat to my mates and have something to do. But.... bringing a modder on board could make this game fantastic. It is so near and yet so far. I don’t understand why they don’t let them run riot and make it fantastic, based upon the intricate knowledge of how complex this game is
---
I work in IT. I know it isn’t as simple as put this here. But the mod world over all platforms, for the salary of one fantastic modder could really save this game
---
If it doesn’t work, fine sack them. But a good well known modder would have the whole community behind them.
---
Edit: and it’s one hell of a community, something that no other game has. Fine you can work on your space sim and doom and whatever, but, here is the fan base. I play doom, the evil within, but I buy because of the brand. Oblivion was such an exiting time and now it seems to have burnt out
---
I created a INT focused alt for this exact reason. Took 120 levels for it to start slowing down to the point that I created another new character to do that challenge with.
---
I wholeheartedly approve of this. I mean, what is going to happen once the major holidays roll around? You'll have more people missing dailies than you did this summer when we have all been stuck inside. Even with covid around many people will still be traveling to see family and unable to login. More so, I'm just tired of the same old routine everyday that has just burnt me out even worse than the currencies cap would have. There is almost zero variety in quests besides killing different creature types or horrible designed ones such as what feels like a neverending quest for the long lost bobblehead. I am really debating skipping season 2 but I know if I do I'll likely just be done with F76 for a long time.  
---
Seeing season 2 being talked about rolled out soon was like a shot in the gut. Yes I'll finish this season but damn give me a REAL break before the next one so I can go back to enjoying the game that I loved playing in the first place for at least a little while.. Giving us weekly quests only would let me finish those and on other days that I feel like playing go back to just enjoying the game without having to wait for the season to end to do so. Please consider this or some other positive change Bethesda so you don't keep burning out your player base..
---
I'm in! How do I find what server you are on?
---
You should take your own advice, pal. 
---
“Just play the game and stop asking these questions and waisting of my life. I’ll never get back that 1 minute reading this crap”
---
They also said PTS today, that's not there either
---
I’m burned out too.  I feel like I won’t be as dedicated to season 2.  Can only grind Westek so much
---
you're taking this way too personally. I couldn't care less about your particular taste in videogames.
---
the fact of the matter is that I'm not the only one who dislikes the direction the game is going. I'd wager that a majority of the playerbase dislikes the mmo aspects of Fo76, actually. case in point, wastelanders was wildly more successful than the legendary run. did it retain players? no, because of the gold bullion grind. and the legendary run actually drove players away because of, you guessed it, the score grind.
---
at this point it's safe to say that by pandering to what their playerbase actually wants, the game would be more successful. *had they advertised it properly on release*, like they did with ESO, we wouldn't be having this conversation. but they didn't. they wanted to cater to everyone. and a lot of people don't feel catered to, being manipulated into doing their daily chores like children.
---
and I do like the game, just not the mmo bs that comes with it.
---
I was playing on my private server when score challenges began to update. So I had my character play the piano while I waited. After a few minutes, I checked to find everyone of them was completed. Guess I will rebuild my camp today.
---
I think when it was the place to nuke was when it was the most lively
---
Thanks for the update, still waiting on mine sadly :/ glad you got yours
---
And the BOS Fanboys are out in force.
---
First add me: egroegy.
---
Then at 5 pm (5h 36 min) ill accept and well go to a server w/o nukes. Fun had by all.
---
Edit; from your social menu you can join friends in their server and vice versus. Looking forward to showing you proof!
---
You probably got down voted because there's already hundreds of posts about this.
---
Like 80% of your chances to win a NW match are finding good gear in the first 5 minutes.
---
Waste all that time hiding because somebody spawned 30 seconds faster and looted all the area ain't cool, and will be most likely your death sentence.
---
All you need to do is kite her away and she lands , if you are doing damage to her start to back away from the tents she usually follow you 
---
Earlier today there were loads of people on the fences and on top of tents .. she was dead in 10 minutes and landed 3 times using this method
---
It's not fps that i know it seems like ping like the good old mw2 days lol. Thanks will be looking into my side.
---
Sure, buddy.  I only post a meme pointing out that I doubt your assertion, and immediately you start insulting me.
---
But yeah, you are the mature one.  Jog on, you great imbecile.
---
If they pander to that part of the player base, who has other options of games to play, it will ruin the game for people who have no other options of games.
---
Why are you so intent on ruining a game for others who do enjoy the direction the game is going in?
---
I mean it’s a typical social place, yeh. People say stuff and other people moan about it.
---
Weird
---
You should check if other people are having the same issues, maybe Bethesda's servers are just fucked
---
That's what prompted this is my friends reporting the same thing.
---
I know the game ebbs and flows, but I gauge interest in how many lfg posts there are on Xbox. When Wastelanders dropped it was easily in the 900s and posts moved off the posting board quickly. Fast forward to now, and 300 plus is a good day. It's usually in the mid 200s. That says interest in the game is waning. With Brotherhood of Steel DLC not arriving until 2021, I am worried the game will not survive. Once something new and comparable arrives, the daily user count may tank. I don't see how Bethesda would limp a game along if it is not drawing in more players. I may be wrong, but I worry the game is on a downward trend.
---
On PC you load in much faster when using SSD
---
Deflecting what? It’s my first comment you lunatic
---
Let me know, cuz I am trying to build more creatively too haha
---
My character has the power to see into the future. 
---
I am Balrog, and I have many powers.
---
As much of a shit show as Red Dead Online is at the moment, The Outlaw Pass is the best battle pass in gaming right now. You can do pretty much anything you want and rank up.
---
Its a great sight.
---
Yea i really wish they would bring in the guns and just lock down to fix this game and improve the tools for future development .
---
What I see is the 'everybody wins' generation getting old enough to face moderately difficult challenge, and not liking the fact that a 'win' takes  a little bit of effort.
---
Reality:  Not everybody is supposed to win everything.  Challenges are supposed to be a challenge.
---
I have not finished yet, but I am 91/100.  I predict I will finish with more than two weeks to spare.  I rarely do the NW challenge, I have missed about 10 days completely, I have spend 0 atoms to advance.  This challenge was too easy and I hope they make the next one a lot harder.
---
I want to text this to a random phone number lol
---
I've had reports all week but haven't suffered i think it's the new flaming vulture.
---
How can they fix this? Everyone’s rig and internet connections are different. This happens in many games I play. My group of four will enter a loading screen at the exact same time but the respawn times will be vastly different on the other side.
---
Lmao not true at all, I've won plenty of games where I didn't have loot til the final circle
---
I won a few games without looting at all, just being creative with building 
---
NW is much more gimmicky than other battle royales, it rewards map memorization and creativity 
---
It's also so easy to lose enemies once they have their sight on you, and again the loot crates are fucking abundant, they really should dial them down a bit
---
If you think you need to find a weapon in the first few minutes to win, you're playing way too aggressively
---
They absolutely should do this. Don't change anything just designate a section of the map as pvp enabled zone. Probably put this somewhere that doesn't get much attention now so that Bethesda doesn't have to spend much money. Maybe they could award xp for kills in this zone and for time survived. It would be a lot of fun. Take players off the map for this zone only. Maybe higher cap rewards for kills in this zone. And simply adding public pvp teams would be so fun. 
---
Please Bethesda. Start listening to the pvp players and throw us a bone. This game is so stale and something like this would change that.
---
Even customizable UI i s exciting
---
Didnt work :/
---
not sure why you are getting downvoted

I've gone in twice in div 2 solo. Got absolutely destroyed both days I tried.
---
you can successfully complete the defend from outside the zone.  Most workshops have 1 or 2 positions where you can sit with a sniper rifle and take out the NPCs.
---
If someone wants to contest it, And it happens during your defend they have to take out the NPCs before they can take the workshop.
---
As long as you are in the area, you will get credit for completing the defend event.
---
Well, I can currently do the weeklys in a day or two.
---
I wasn't suggesting making the weekly challenges harder, just worth more points than they are.
---
Waiting till everyone can load? Most online games do this
---
I will happily do my dailies until you're off.
---
Dont work too hard. Looking forward to science :)
---
When you try to save everyones ass, being a bad neighbour is the last thing you concerned about. That's why BoS is the best faction, they don't pick a fight with every possible danger for their own good. They do it for everyones good. But regardless, Taggerdy's fan-service chapter in Appalachia is hardly the same as the original west coast BoS.
---
Yes, already got the platinum. Need help with it?
---
lol are you serious? damn son, I'm surprised Jangles backpack isn't dangling off your butt instead of your back
---
Me too. I would keep my old console just to play this. They don’t understand that we finally have the fallout we all wanted but they broke it. Bring in the modders, the coders, the lovers of this game
---
How tf do you not have stimpacks? There are petrified scorched all over the place lol, I've never seen them all looted
---
Try doing the leader of the pack event in the forest region. It drops low to mid level legendary armor and weapons. Should help you get some good starting weapons
---
If you want to pick fights in the first minute of the game sure it's not fair 
---
But it's fair if you do literally other strategy 
---
Again you're invisible and invincible for later in the game than everyone else, the game is allowing you to escape this first encounter and try and find loot elseware 
---
Everybody else does not have this option to escape this first encounter if they spawned before you 
---
If you choose not to use this opportunity to escape, then that's your choice, the game offered you a way to escape and even the odds by looting elsewhere while being invisible so you can't be chased, and you chose not to use the opportunity

I'm getting so burnt out on this season (around rank 90) that I'm not sure I can sustain it again unless they really knock it out of the park with the rewards in season 2 (and they actually work). The only reason I'm logging in at this point is to do enough to roughly get a rank each day, ignoring anything too time consuming. This was after going hard on all of the dailies and some XP grinding for most of the season. 
---
If what is being reported about season 2 being military focused is accurate, then I personally might not care about it at all. There are some cool CAMP items a military themed season could have (more turrets, turret skins, defenses, bunker items for instanced CAMPS, ETC). But it'll probably be a bunch of broken skins and half implemented CAMP stuff again. They have to get Season 2 right, or it'll go in the bin of largely ignored content like Atlas.
---
No not your camp limit, your inventory stash
---
i stay for the bj's
---
A friend did this on my private server last week, and I swear within seconds we got a server shutdown notification. LOL. I'd never seen this notification before on a private server.
---
Thank you. That's all they could have done instead of downvote.
---
See, this is community.  And wow that's a lot of posts.
---
Same. It took more than 7 weeks, but first time ever the auto-complete bug hit me as well.
---
We are waiting. Shopping selling server hopping grinding for the perfect armor/weapon.. building trying to find the perfect campsight refine your build but most of all waiting for tuesday I'd say ..again. also I have a gym in my garage?
---
You're not recognizing the fun side of starting fresh with new knowledge. New ways to approach things, new options (although, yes, we're very limited as far as options) and just having fun while doing it. If you think of it as work, you'll never have fun.
---
maybe I do, Maybe I don't. Still would nuke the place for having it there
---
Haha...i work in a lab so I'm looking forward to no more science. Just Fallout and beer!
---
I rebuild my camp in a new location every month or so. That can take all day. The rest of the time I do dailies, scavenge for materials, take over workshops, go shopping, inventory management, and occasionally pick away at my giant unfinished quest list. 
---
I run a stealth sniper build and I like clearing out areas without being seen. It takes some patience.
---
What do you mean?
---
I haven't taken Starched off in at least 1000 hours lol. Bloody Mess comes off because it's not the end of the world if I forget, plus the card is one of the first ones on the list so I don't have to scroll to re equip it.
---
whoosh
---
This isn't Google
---
Did you notice the skeletons foot moves by itself?
---
Varying internet connection speeds and whether or not the game is loaded on a SSD drive be it Internal/External will always the determining factor.
---
No sh*t there’s no mention on google but I see them in people’s camps
---
Would love to have a white paint job for this armor
---
I work with computers: just dont make me hack a terminal. And as homer put it.... Mmmmmmmmmm beeeeeeer.
---
Anyway Smut, looking forward to the weekend to. See you in Appalachia buddy
---
-Egg
---
Since I unlocked starched genes, I've never taken it off. I leave super duper on as well cuz I'm a noob and don't know any better
---
Crazy twist: When it finally shows up, it's going to be wrapped in canvas.
---
I have been running herbivore for months, the though of eating spoiled veggies never crossed my mind.. thank you kind stranger!
---
I haven't yet, but I am terrified of doing so. As a precaution I am slowly building up an emergency stock of my "must have" mutation serums.
---
I'm guessing it has something to do with servers,proba ly cross platform too. Even on the PS4 side of things there where a few "shutting down for maintenance" notifications on a server a few nights ago. Fast travel is still slow, but some of the random freezes went away. At least on my install.
---
On the PC side yeah, fast traveling has become more of a intermission lol. I always sing "Let's go out to the Lobby and get ourselves a snack". Sometimes I wish it was a thing, like a mod. Just for some comic relief.
---
They did say they were bringing back the "private test server" I don;'t know why they would tease us with those details if they decided to make it private again.
---
so you're saying it's a bad business move to pander to a majority of your playerbase? that it's better to cater to the minority?
---
big brain move my man.
---
regardless, neither you nor I have any saying on the matter. ultimately it's up to Bethesda, and I'm sure they'll keep shoving mobile-esque bs down people's throats.
---
but the fact is that the majority of the playerbase, I'd wager, plays the game in spite of the mmo bs, not because of it. you're a minority here. I don't know what's so hard to understand about that. I don't go to the ESO sub and complain that there aren't enough singleplayer options, because that's not what the playerbase wants, nor what the game is.
---
this is not the case with Fo76. you're arguing that an endless legendary grind is a good thing. but the playerbase does not reflect that.
---
Yes, but my experiment with the Nuka-Cola cooler shows things still spoil pretty fast. Good with Salt perk or refrigerated backpack are still vastly superior.
---
I see new players flowing out of 76 every day, and I do my best to see that they stay. A big part of the LFG issue is that the people who are most active on there tend to be the people who are playing to the meta, and are usually keeping an eye out for new exploits, or waiting for a juicy deal to trade off 100k flux. The low numbers are discouraging, but I'm happy to see that the posts have meaning. I see trades for items I haven't been asked for in over a year, and new players asking questions! 76 is entering a new phase, and I'm gonna continue trying to make it a good one.
---
yea I tried the fire thing, I defaulted to hanging it over the creek I'M camped at.
---
Ya like Bailey’s?
---
Happens with consoles too, here and there.
---
I've somehow taken a Addictall at least 3 different times since I've became a junkies build. It's a pain in the ass getting the meds to reset them all.
---
I won't shoot settlers even if they have stars; it just doesn't feel sporting. Kind of like shooting a kitten, or fish in a barrel. 
---
Raiders though, are fair game since they think of themselves as predators and everyone else as prey; and that the strong should take what they want from the weak. Unfortunately, they often discover too late that a vault dweller with power armor and a gauss minigun is an indisputable argument this principle can apply to them as well.
---
Wait, I was told those dupers were good for the game?? Such a joke man. Now every camp is full of the same 250 stupid taxidermy plans and not much else. Camp hopping used to be so much fun before the dupers ruined the economy.
---
Oh yeah, Ive you have finished all of the content then you will be bored out of your mind. In that case maybe look for another game.
---
And its been out for +1 year
---
Ive had mild lag issues since the last patch. Notably during hoard events.
---
Same over on ps4. The random stuttering has gone down, but now its major audio desync and fast travel lockups.
---
For sure! I feel like all the lag has been causing some ffr weapons to do no damage.
---
What items?
---
Happened to me the first time ever as well today. Everything completed except ofcourse the NW one.
---
No, they said public
---
Actually did it like a week ago for the 1st time going through a Rad shower. Guess I removed Starched Genes the previous time I played for some dumb@$$ reason and forgot to place it back. Thankfully I had the caps and was able get all them replaced after 2 or 3 server hops. Funny thing I noticed though. When you don't need them I can find them for 250-300 caps. But, when I needed them I was finding them for any where between 600 - 1k caps. Last server I was on had them for 500 a pop. Went for it. I ended up shutting down their vendors and maxing them out I guess.lol It's crazy how much you miss Marsupial when you don't have it.
---
It’s a bug. It’ll go away.
---
The items you pick up during the event
---
My Plasma Caster does 850 base damage 😎 (if i use VATS crit. O do more tha 2500 per shot😂🤣) i can kill a necrotic sheepsquatch with 2-3 shots 😂🤣😂and a lvl 70 deathclaw with only one shot🤣😂🤣😎😎
---
Those keycards drive me crazy every damn day. Three screens of the same key to scroll through. Drive me nuts.
---
I mean, of course! You kill them and eat them to gain their power!
---
Same as everyone else, really.
---
It's still today
---
This is something Bethesda absolutely needs to take account for before next gen launches and gives people an advantage even on console.
---
100% yes. the pvp in this game is atrocious, but yes, I think the people that enjoy pvp deserve a "contested" zone. You could even put valuable resources and such in there that people would actually be fighting over. What a crazy concept.
---
Depends where you are :-)
---
They should definitely make this a possibility! You can golf in GTA5! Why not Fallout?
---
Can do
---
Maybe he got suspended and doesn’t want to tell anyone?
---
Same here. I run my medics at low health with unyielding armor. Use to be able to stand in front of the queen and tank her damage, now I can barely make it through the mobs without dying. Its sad because it was one of my favorite team builds, its been benched since the last patch.
---
ITV yesterday says it is coming on this coming Tuesday. Keep up.
---
That makes sense. What about the one player stuck in an infinite load screen? They just get timed out?
---
Would be nice if they made this an option, beats making a second character and only learning certain plans
---
If you throw in a few pieces of paper they'll hook you up with a copy of President Eden's book The Joy of Semantics.
---
Can this bug appear in the excavator power armor quest? I broke it and now I can't make the power armor on my main lol
---
If this means I'd never get another nocturnal pool cue or a bashing damage rolling pin, I'm all ears.
---
HAHA I went for Concrete for 2 reasons, 1 for the concrete dump for BoS and 2, every time i camp build, I use A LOT of concrete lol
---
Coo clucks clan?
---
I'm on PS4 and get a few crashes a day now, but the biggest issue is how long it takes for the game to load up my CAMP and any other CAMP I fast travel too.  It's crazy slow.
---
Ofc I'm aggressive lol. When you stumble upon a full geared team with marine armor, handmades and gauss shotguns doesn't matter how creative your building is or how good you are at hiding, you better be well geared or you won't have any chance against them.
---
Props to you for being able to win doing that, but I don't find it a reliable way to win tho.
---
You can’t
---
It would be nice to have other stuff like this but for other animals.
---
Something like a large cage enclosure where you can store tamed pets and they periodically generate whatever's in their loot pool into a collection bin. Make it so whatever pet is in the cage is protected as long as the cage isn't destroyed. Would be awesome to have a caged deathclaw at your camp and get deathclaw eggs from it.
---
I'm perfectly ok with dailies and weeklies but I just want them to be different and more difficult. Or just weird shit like kill 5 super mutants while drunk on nukashine! Or kill 10 robots with a pool cue lol
---
Did it drop Recipe: 11 secret herbs and spices?
---
Yes? That rarely ever happens but yes, they get kicked out of the match
---
Omg this is not the point, everyone should have a fair shot of gaining that loot, and you don’t stay invisible for very long so you escape and go to another place, there’s another person there that does have a weapon and you have nothing to defend yourself?
---
Yeah but mayby its goal for years to a acomplish not to do in a week? Hell i dont Play a lot of fo76 had 2 big breaks and im still level 200. Its not like you have to earn all of them at once. Its meant to be op. Not to mention i have seen over 20 or more people with level 800+...
---
I have a fun idea for a throwaway new character. Just need some time to level him up a bit.
---
It is insanely grindy. I have actually given up on progressing the main Wastelanders missions, to concentrate on dailies, weeklies, etc.  I am so bored of endlessly capping and defending the same workshop and covering it in 20 lights, 20 blackberry bushes, 5 doors, etc. etc. Although, it is quite funny when you arrive at a workshop and see it in this state, with numerous people's random builds all over the place... and a bunch of feral ghouls hacking away at all those lamps... 😀
---
most of the high levels are buying things to be nice, not because they need them. that's what i've found to be the case, and as such leave "token" items in my vend that are slightly inflated in price like stimpaks or grenades.. that might seem sneaky, but nice players who think you need the caps will buy them regardless. kind of like a "donation" box if they have a positive interaction with me or something.
---
so yeah, 5/30 randomly higher priced items that high level santa mans can pay for, and the rest of my vend is plans at about 75% off (which are intended for anybody).
---
How about you don't tell me what to do?
---
Same here. During Line in the Sand, Encrypted, Scorched Earth, or Radiation Rumble I have had lag on my PS4 since this last update.
---
They don’t always drop stims and they aren’t everywhere, I don’t have a problem because I run Pharma farma but plenty of other people don’t, the point here is FAIRNESS, I don’t understand what you don’t get about that, and clearly other people agree because you’re being downvoted
---
Is that the only place to buy PA plans? Or does it drop somewhere else?
---
Yeah for sure. I recently made a new character and the only plan I've learned on purpose is the fixer 😅
---
The only one I found yesterday was 3000 like dude no
---
Very nice! Love it! :D
---
Seems like a pretty sterile and hygienic solution
---
A quest! Involving some Science! Machine to wipe memory...
---
Edit: Like a repeatable one based on some object spawn.  Maybe some *portable power pack* and some *hypnotic token* 
---
Fight the way to the *Forgetatron*  defeat the mad robobrain use the portable pack and the token.  
---
If you want another plan removed, rinse and repeat.  Find another pack and token. 
---
The pack and the token are tradeable and can be sold on the vendor machine at camp.
---
Back in the good old days I had this Discord that was really active, there were people making mazes in the whitespring golf club with prizes such as serums in them, good times.
---
Might do...might just get the responder backpack or save the atoms for the future (I think someone mined a West Virginia state trooper helmet and power armour...that would be right up my alley).
---
That SS backpack (that just sounds such a bad short form really) might work though.
---
Which items have you seen? I've never seen any of them, id love a pet rock lol
---
Ya. Nah. Not paying that. But it again. You only find thw low prices when you already have it. lol Murphys Law
---
Maybe two wrongs don't make a right, but sometimes two bugs cancel each other out?  The Scorchbeast Queen has had (bugged) immunity for months now, so I have no qualms using an OP weapon to bring her down.  If the SBQ AI was fixed, and the immunity to crippling was fixed, I would think twice about melting her, but as is...
---
All of them put I don’t know if it is only possible on pc
---
My main issue with them is s they should match 3* good with salt. I still find them handy for builds that can't spare 3 luck points, which is most these days.
---
What did it drop
---
SSD's do help, but if your motherboard supports it, go with a M.2 drive instead. On a older computer, I recently replaced the SSD game drive with a 1TB M.2 drive on a PCI card because the MB is too old. Noticeable improvement. But it's still not as fast as the M.2 installed on MB on main gaming PC.
---
Yep, I guess I'll pick them up every time I see them under 500 now lol, or bite the bullet and buy the plan and start making them myself
---
doesn't work like that. 
---
i made an alt to text the theory myself (despite people saying it didn't work like that). the only weapon plans i learned were fixer and handmade. It doesn't stop you getting wrenches and missile launchers and rolling pins
---
That is my guess that's its some sort of mod
---
Possibly I have no clue
---
You realize you don't need to learn the plans for the base game weapons right? Just the stuff that's been added
---
lol they get so mad and accuse me of using quantums and teslas
---
Weapon levels are stupid as hell. If your going to give me a gun for a reward then let me use the damn gun
---
I don’t think that includes the basic plans of the game, just that if you know the special ones you can get those drops
---
u/Ladydevann could there be a possible fix for this issue and compensation for the potential loss of Score points?
---
All answer I got from the Bethesda support is they are "working" on this issue
---
and "Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to edit/grant S.C.O.R.E."
---
saying they cannot grant score points to the users affected by this bug.
---
Sorry I wasn't clearer.  I am suggesting they iplement some mechanism to remove rolling pins, and wrenches for example, from the drop pools
---
Well even normal and ADS with bow just seems to miss a lot. Earlier today I was ADS with bow aiming at a ghoul who was standing completely still and my crosshair was centered on it. My first 3 shots missed, the whole time ghoul and crosshair didn't move, than the 4th shot hit, same ghoul and crosshair position. My position didn't change either with all 4 shots.
---
I did YouTube really hard for 2 years. 500+ videos, went from nothing to 18000 subs. usually put in 40+ hours per week on my channel while also working 40 hours per week at my full time job.
---
It's exhausting man. It's so draining. You get on this content creation treadmill and you feel like the second you step off of it, all of your fans will go somewhere else (and they usually do). The algorithm is absolutely brutal. Upload every day. Oversell. Overhype. Sensationalize more on every video to get those views. I got to the point where a game came out that I really wanted to play, but I knew that my viewers wouldn't be interested, and I just kind of dropped my channel for a year. Wouldn't be surprised if Rifle gaming is going through something like that, though hopefully not for as long. Playing something other than FO76 and he knows his fans won't be all that interested, or maybe he got into an alpha or something that he can't make content for yet. And as far as making content for games goes, FO76 is a poor bet to base your channel on.
---
That’s where we were but there’s a random event on the best building spot so it takes up a huge amount of your budget so that’s why we moved
---
It's fine if there's loot that not everyone has equal opportunity to get if there are enough other opportunities out there to still even the odds, which do exist in this game
---
If you're consistently getting caught even while invisible maybe you should try and start learning a different location to drop, because like I said it's typically easy to escape encounters in the game, unless like you're invisible in the middle of an open field 
---
Learning the map and getting better about finding the loot spawns, how to evade enemy players, and what spawns work for your playstyle are all part of the skill curve in the game 
---
You can either get mad about it, which does nothing because realistically Bethesda updates this game mode like once a year lol, or you can learn how to make the game more fair for yourself 
---
Once you do so it's quite fun
---
I know if everyone leaves a public match, all the events start rolling out. 3 different hoards, guided meditation, radiation rumble, the works.
---
Those are base game weapons so they are always in the pool no matter what you learn.
---
must be a hack.
---
Simply put, no. The only way they would is if we assume that Mark V enemies aren’t considered by the game a different enemy and are simply a higher level version of the Mark 0, otherwise no. It will still be the normal Mark 0s, just maxed to their level cap. 
---
Wherever you find a glowing ghoul, it will scale to each persons level, but it’s still a glowing ghoul. Certain enemies will still cap off low like mole miners at Level 40 or eyebots at 1.
---
Well i see players over 600-700 more and more often. I have seen over 20 800 level and even few 1000 (and i dont play a lot). Meaning in a year seeing 600-700 will be normal. I think this system should make years. Its not like having 6 perks maxed will make you twice stronger than having 4. Not to mention that there is no real need to make you stronger after you reach level 150? At this time you probably have op gear etc. and can one shot most enemies.
---
it's always today, wherever I am.
---
Start farming those nuke zones in Whitesprings and Morgantown.lol
---
So many people don't know that it amazes me
---
Sort of wish they'd at least troll us a bit with a credits screen that asks if you want to start a new game. Make people panic a bit.
---
Edited the post to make it clearer.  It is some of the crappy base weapons I'm talking about unlearning.
---
Based game weapons will always be in the pool, otherwise you could just unlearn to one specific weapon and get just that.
---
Yes but it doest work like that. You don't need plans for the base game weapons. Only the stuff that's been added
---
Super annoying
---
I found singing Yankee doodle doodle while the head pat was occuring really helped.
---
Fair would be like it was before this shitty season system, around 3 daillies with 10, 2 with 20, one be 30-40 atom, i liked way better when it was like that, atleat you could feel you're progressing it to buy an desired pack.
---
How did you get that sign "The Camp You Can Trust"? Is that an atomic shop item, or something else?
---
Yay! Totally this!
---
I work 10 hour days. I get on at 8 and play until 10.on those days. There are times I get bored when events like radiation rumble and project paradise come on and the people on are to big of pos to do them because they are to hard. I live for those two events and scorched earth.  The dailies are just there to give me something  to do until a event shows up. I finished the season weeks ago. People will never be happy  with anything this game  does . I wish they would just quit .Nobody will miss you . I enjoy playing it . Just wish people would join the harder events more often.
---
Not how it works though.....
---
He was playing fallout 76 last night, I added him to my Xbox friends list. Maybe he's just working on a new video?
---
With all the cork we gave them they will make cork armour and our syringers won’t be able to get past their defences
---
You shouldn’t be able to normally obtain these items as they disappear from your inventory once it’s done like all the other event specific items.
---
I did that when repairing a collectron at someone elses base.
---
Even expecting as much as the Creation Club is a stretch.  Having a large selection of mods, even if they're just ones approved by Bethesda, would get messy really fast.  Just think of some of the "mods" people would expect compared to previous games.
---
People want to mods in new weapons or gear?  Well that isn't happening with characters you can bring over to the public servers where those items don't exist.
---
People want to mod in new assets for their camp?  Well again, none of those would be able to carry over to the public game.
---
Plus you have to consider that anything you mod your world with that requires client side assets will also be required by anyone visiting your server, and you would need to have the assets required to visit anyone elses world.
---
For all the reasons above it's more likely that rather than what we traditionally consider "mods" for Fallout games won't be happening, but we'll instead have "mods" that let someone change things about the game server side.  Changing enemy spawns/difficulty, full world open pvp and stuff like that.
---
It’s a smoking device to calm my brain after my shift lol.  It’s been rough these past few months. Honestly, this game and the gym have really helped me relax from work and school! So thank you FO76! Just listen to your community now!
---
But you living the next gen. Working out while falling out!
---
I was able to get it from a third party app store called aptoide when I was just getting into fo4
---
I don't mind being downvoted, and sure maybe you have valid points 
---
But I still think if instead of getting upset about the perceived unfairness of the game, and instead learning to use its mechanics to your advantage, you guys would be having more fun
---
And yeah there are some locations that don't have many petrified scorched, and there are others that are abundant, if you're consistently low on stimpacks it sounds like you should switch up your usual spawn location
---
also remove the stupid vault steel. we already have to get the rep the modules and the gold. shouldnt take 3 months to get some armor.
---
Yeah I know but I kinda wanteed to get it through a glitch that I think exists
---
It would give me something to do everyday at least
---
What are you talking about
---
Where did you find a tameable one?
---
Not for the person you are talking to, could be your tomorrow for them...
---
I would keep my Santatron going, just to hear his line "Oh no, no, why would you do that? WHY?!?!?"
---
I love my Santatron lol
---
That’s all YOU could of done buddy.
---
Um I didn't even know you had to do that for reskin! Now I'm definitely not buying any that come out. Maybe if enough people get this out there they'll fix it to avoid hurting the bottom line (especially now that our free atoms are reduced)
---
As a throwable item, tatos too.
---
Yeah, I didn't actually even think of that until someone mentioned it here Haha.
---
Against a team like that, aggressive playstyle would be suicide in my opinion lol
---
I would wait for an opportune moment where one of the endgame monsters comes in to wreck their shit, and try and pick them off one by one while they're preoccupied 
---
The game does not reward guns blazing at all, it's a mix of survival and also battle royale 
---
The ai enemies become bigger threats as the circle closes, which you can use to your advantage
---
I didn't know that either until I bought the Raider vendor skin yesterday XD
---
What day does the season end?
---
Yes PLEASE. All it would take is a “Replace” option like there is for walls to switch styles.
---
When I first started wandering Appalachia, a Scorchbeast spawned by Belching Betty and chased me anywhere I went.  I spent 45 minutes using up all my chems and ammo just to take her down.  Died multiple times.  
---
These days, I can take them down without working up a sweat, but I know exactly how you feel  lol
---
I couldn't even afford the space to place my chicken coops down. Deleted some 5 small items and it still wasn't  enough.
---
My disappoint was as immeasurable as that chicken coops budget cost.
---
He wants the option to base weapons removed from the pool. He's using the word "unlearn", admittedly incorrectly, but the point is that he wants shitty weapons out of the pool. Plans are irrelevant to the point.
---
Nope, wasn’t very good. You were spot on, it was very anticlimatic. At least the poster displayed correctly on my brick walls. I think it’s time to take a little break now...
---
I am pretty sure that every single weapon is in the pool except for the rep stuff, fixers and bear arms.
---
They're different sizes unfortunately, so we have to replace them as seperate objects.
---
“But how do you know I’m legendary? Have mercy friend!” 
---
“I want that sweet rolling pin, I gotta do what I gotta do.”
---
You keep claiming majority doesn't want this, but offer nothing to back it up.
---
I honestly don't think a company would make a change the majority of players don't want, considering how rocky the games standing already is.
---
I would say it's the opposite, and that your in the minority here, wanting to change the game to a more single player experience that you already have access to, while a majority of players want a multiplayer game since there isn't another one to enjoy currently
---
There aren't a lot of them but you can plant them at your camp, so really you could have as many as you want?
---
I'm sure you could knock down a wall, shrink a room's footprint, or trade out that 8th water purifier for some gourds.  ;)
---
It’s atom shop
---
I’m not saying I have a problem personally, I don’t, I have a plan a b and c for where I spawn, but not everyone has this, especially new players and players that are coming on to do the dailies 
---
If you don’t tell a company there’s a problem they don’t know there’s a problem and nothing gets changed, it’s not complaining and whining it’s constructive advice on how to make the game better and fairer 
---
To my knowledge there isn’t another battle royal that has this problem
---
I think it's more a case of me just assuming what would happen Haha. I just saw chicken and my brain immediately said "cool, we will get eggs" without any additional thought process.
---
Bye
---
np.. be careful about eating spoiled fruit though.. I did some how catch a disease from that  
---
but I munch on spoiled veggies all day long with no issue. I've recently found inert flux to be a good water source too which is pretty cool.. it weighs much less than water I think
---
I'll vaccinate them with Nuka Cola My Blood's In It delivered at high velocity with a lead chaser.
---
Again this is not my problem, it’s a problem for many players, again I run pharma farma, I have a plan a b and c and I’m always good, I know the area of the map that I spawn in like the back of my hand, it’s not a personal problem, it’s community wide
---
Indeed, this definitely is the main issue, but maybe if you squeezed a vendor in a spot and the skin wont fit for the replace, it just doesn't let you.
---
While correct, it has nothing to do with where I am. And it's always today where I am.
---
Ok so that way nobody could get them at all. It’s cool but could b annoying
---
I wish Handmade skins completely remade the suppressor, something that isn’t as bulky and more along the lines of a Fixer appearance.
---
Unfortunately, it is not fixed. For the first time (for me) I lost some weeklies this week. You'd think they'd figure this out by now...
---
Power Smith is the one for crafting PA and Contractor for camp/workshop
---
Nahhhhh dude leave my boy Wallace right there he runs that bih. When the game first came out I used to do a lap of Harpers for weapons to scrap for mods and to sell to all the dif factions lol I’d be sad if he got moved now.
---
Workshop defenses have been the main ones I've seen lately.
---
I have fast internet and fast gaming PC, and I still have longish load screens going from inside locations to outside locations, and from outside to interior event locations like mines (Ex: Lode Baring). But I can FT outside to outside very quickly.
---
Not rare for some players. So the developers need to draw a line at some point in time. I’m just saying that if you’re consistently spawning in that far behind the other players, you may find yourself on the wrong side of that line, and getting timed out yourself.
---
I don't know how much I can trust that town. 
---
I mean, it just doesn't have enough decapitated heads on pikes and only has one corpse hanging from the trees...
---
Well then they need to learn how the game works and they will be less frustrated 
---
Still some frustration definately, but also less haha
---
My camp budget is tight what little room I have left I’m saving for a cat. Only two purifiers, could go down to one. I have an even mix of all the veggies planted cuz I run herbivore. Also I’m off the ground so if I grow more I need more planter tiles and gourds suck to place on those
---
I think he's handy where he is, I hit him up after clearing the lower area before continuing up to the church. Then visit him again after I'm done. I'd hate to lose him.
---
I thought he'd moved to Twitch at first, as he tweeted saying he was now partnered with them. But see he's not posted there for a while either.  Hope all is well with him, I enjoy his videos.
---
Totally. Been waiting for Uranium Fever for days, for the legendary kills. Haven't seen it since maybe Tues/Wed.
---
Was just thinking yesterday that there seem to be a lot fewer events than usual.
---
Moar gunz for my armory!
---
It feels like they made that sign specifically for trap camps.
---
Yeah I took grafton steel (I think it was grafton) and had a level 130 attack me. Killed me once and I knew I didn’t really stand a chance. I just went back to my camp and let him hav it.
---
I spawn like 5-10 seconds later, why not just extend every players' loading screen a bit yk
---
My theme is a town that was taken over by raiders
---
Yes I would love to see the game mode changed, but I also know it may not happen or take a long time to occur
---
So instead of contributing to the complaints and angry users, I try to explain some ways to play that causeless frustration and make the game more fair then what it's initially perceived as
---
Naw it'll be fine.
---
I wish those stealth players would learn it's a lot easier to stay stealthed simply by keeping away from other players and keeping moving. Then the aggro enemies they're attracting don't detect you by contact or line of sight or by investigating where your shot came from.
---
When I was on top of tents the enemies would hit me while trying to attack other players, and it seemed like once they hit me they would end up detecting me.
---
A few times enemies would even spawn up on the tent with us, which sort of defeated the whole point of being up there. After that lost me some flux I stopped placing my tent at SBQ till after the fight. I do the entire fight in the grass field outside the V9 fence now and almost never die.
---
I run with AGL of 34 and no stealth perk card or armor and these are just my observations after almost 2000 hours, maybe other people have observed differently.
---
The game is sorely missing social hubs. Whitesprings is an obvious choice, as well as the two faction HQs. The Overseer's house at Sutton is another example. Hell even the extrance to Big Bend where Blue Ridge is set up. Scrap boxes and scrip machines in all those locations please.
---
Well I can assure you that you might not be enslaved and or killed in the island!
---
I know it doesn't fix it, but I log a ticket each time it happens.
---
This just further makes me want to build a camp like a little old western town...
---
Compared to a Junkie Explosive Gatling Plasma it's nothing though and it's super ammo inefficient. Plus I'm never going to use VATS cus I prefer manual aiming.
---
That’s not how the legendary loot pool works. 
---
Legendary loot pool is made up of every basic weapon. These are the weapons that naturally spa n as non legendaries in the world. On top of that their are some weapons like the fixer that don’t spawn naturally. These weapons have a plan and the weapon doesn’t show up in the legendary loot pool til you learn the plan. So even if you unlearned rolling pins right now, you would still get legendary versions. 
---
What you are actually asking for is for the legendary loot pool to be based solely off of whatever weapon you can personally craft.
---
The Brotherhood vendor in Watago has a bunch of PA mod plans. I think Responder vendors have Excavator plans and Raider vendors have Raider PA mod plans
---
You need to server hop and then go back to modus to restart.   Currently I have like 15 cards but after awhile it gets boring and the ammo for killing a cargo so many times adds up
---
COLLECTING FUN IS WHAT I DOO.
---
Exactly, so when talking in a global community you can never say today or give a day as a release, Beth need to state the estimated time, time zone and date, you've nicely made my.point...
---
Since when do people make suggestions for existing game mechanics?  The whole point for a suggestion is that you are proposing a change to something.  SMH
---
Wish we had Power Armor Scorched.
---
i dont think the arrows move as quickly as bullets do, and enemies in 76 do try to dodge incoming fire to an extent.
---
i sometimes have a solid chain of bow kills, but if i'm not focusing on aiming, i miss a lot more than i would with a firearm. you do have to pay attention to be consistent with the bow.
---
vats with the bow.. don't even bother
---
You were clear. People are just telling you that unlearning the plan wouldn’t do what you want.
---
This isn’t the issue...
---
Make dailies give scrip or something after completing the board! I’m getting useless score
---
It is my impression Collasal Problem will be much more difficult.
---
Exactly.  Thank you!
---
I love the santatron!! I don't have him but I love hearing his dialog at other people's camps! I giggle every time
---
&gt;You keep claiming majority doesn't want this, but offer nothing to back it up.
---
but I did.
---
'wastelanders was wildly more successful than the legendary run. did it retain players? no, because of the gold bullion grind. and the legendary run actually drove players away because of, you guessed it, the score grind.'
---
there I go, repeating myself, again. is this udeniable proof that the majority of the playerbase dislikes mobile-esque mechanics? no, but it paints a picture.
---
&gt;I honestly don't think a company would make a change the majority of players don't want, considering how rocky the games standing already is.
---
like I said, a lot of people brave through the mmo aspects of the game because we just enjoy the other aspects that much. every other hour you get people cursing the legendary run but those same people diligently grind their daily score. unfortunately mobile tactics *are* profitable regardless of whether the playerbase enjoys getting ripped off. or do you think people actually want to go bankrupt rolling characters in gachas?
---
&gt;I would say it's the opposite
---
and do you have anything to back that claim? because the track record so far implies the opposite.
---
Can I borrow some of that luck? I'm still dissatisfied witg everything I have other tban my gauss shotgun.
---
*"Maybe I will deal with it. Hmm? Maybe I'll deal with it the way I dealt with Curly Jefferson!"*
---
Added to Inventory: Mounted Curly Jefferson.
---
I was about to post this as a PSA: I tagged a Grafton Monster as I was running by, found a hiding spot, and later when the circle moved and killed it, I got credit as one of the five needed.
---
Hold up is there a pirate outfit in game that I’ve just never come across?
---
I never hesitate killing those weakling settlers. A legendary 3* even better, even though most likely I'll just get a lame 1* drop from him.
---
Exactly what I do.
---
Other places sell PA plans but every type is consolidated inside Whitesprings other than Excavator plans. For those you need to visit Camden Park.
---
I'm just looking to 100% all Fallout titles. Already did Fallout Shelter before 76, so you know I'm accustomed to CBT.
---
The goal for Beth is to create a system in which the perception is they want us to play daily, but the real goal is increasing in game purchases. So they created a new system where you have to grind every day or you won't achieve the end items and will have to purchase atoms to get them. Money, money, money.
---
Removing the worse weapons makes the whole rng system not a grind which they don’t want
---
Yep. Same happened to me a few days ago. Only time tho, level 330
---
A couple of people on my public team fought it the other day. I could tell because the "go crazy" icons appeared by their names. I had never seen the WC in person before, so I immediately went to go help.
---
Took us 20 minutes to beat that bastard. The lvl 80 Scorchbeast that showed up didn't help.
---
I've had this happen to me but it updated after 10 mins of doing nothing.
---
The colour variations of the base vendor is still the same model, no? Should be easy to add a "Replace" option for that, even if only for that Vendor model.
---
Take my upvote damnit 😂
---
I agree with this. Events like swarm if suitors will be way more fun with max level enemies
---
White knight in agility reduces the cost of repairing armor.
---
I would definitely share the wealth if they allowed us to trade this stuff. I scrapped so many unyielding thorn pieces because I don't play a bloodied build
---
Hehe, yeah. I need those killer achievements and leveling up to 100.
---
Pretty funny when they're just sat there saying shit like "Fucking coward!" or "You're dead!", but they're just sat there playing tunes while you beat them down.
---
This mutation has killed me more than any single enemy type to date I think.
---
Maybe they could add some differences; drop the dailies down somewhat, add 1-2 more weekly goals, and add some season-long goals for somewhat higher rewards; I'm thinking of something like the Possum badges, in terms of scope, for much higher rewards.  If you REALLY want to grind them out, you can jump a big chunk forward, but then you're out of stuff to do except dailies/weeklies.  But if not, you can plug away and complete like 80% of them just in passive play, only having to focus on the objectives for the last few bits here and there.
---
Also, I really think there'd be value in adding a daily quest that was basically "clear X location", where the location list was any big location with a red/green chest at the "boss", quest completed when you loot the box for the widget it contains.  Would help drive people to locations they might not otherwise go to, at least.  Randomize this by player if not login, of course, because otherwise everyone's spamming the same location which sucks.
---
I'll look that up thank you.
---
only the tops of the smaller slanted walls. I just tested it.
---
Dude can u just work for Beth so these become real
---
Found the person who won't like BoS! Welcome to the Free States! 😂
---
Yeah, having it open the day after announcing it did seem too good to be true! 
---
I guess their working day hasn't finished yet though so there's still time.
---
Placing a survival tent in the road in front of Fort Defiance, then starting Line In The Sand...it makes a ton of max level scorched all spawn directly in the middle of the event instead of waves of just a few scorched.
---
I do that, and use my quad Tesla to get hits on everything, and can walk away with almost an entire level of xp from a single event.
---
Wait, there’s a new fridge that’s different than the one we’ve had for the past year or so?
---
This would be a great idea.  Up vote this post
---
I don't sweat it at all.  One day I didn't ever finish the "hack a terminal" daily.  Why?  I didn't feel like it.  That's all.  I didn't want to do it (that would have felt like a grind).
---
Another day - I never killed 10 scorched.  I realized it the next day.  I hadn't run into many - and forgot.  Meant to get to it later.  No biggy.
---
.... and I'm still level 83 on it, with plenty of time to finish it.  
---
About the only thing I "force" myself to do - is log into a public server to go buy 3 items.  (I guess I could technically do this on a private server, but that feels cheap).  However - I often end up getting to join in on an SBQ, or find some interesting bases.  So I thank Bethesda for that;  at least once each day - I see a new base.
---
There is a black paint in the files so hopefully that gets added soon
---
I have noticed this si ce the update there doesnt seem to be as many events popping up
---
Looks like it's up now.
---
There was nothing wrong with the old atom rewards system. I did the daily challenges on occasion and would do the weekly challenges. I was able to get all the items from the atom store I wanted and I am currently sitting on 3550 atoms and never had to pay a penny.
---
This is what they are trying to eliminate.
---
I haven't played in 3 weeks because of the dailies. I've been playing New Vegas again.
---
I love seeing players do things like that. My son and I like to visit camps in matching outfits and beat each other with the commie whackers. 
---
Stuff like that makes it fun.
---
I feel like that may be slightly inaccurate. 
---
I’m a bloodied who is annoyed by the food mechanic in general yet before BGS ruined building I’d rebuild my camp weekly if not more.
---
Sad, I know.
---
If you are on PC...

Thank you . I was wondering why that happened sometimes.
---
Armourer reduces cost for armour crafting.
---
Another player in your comments has said: "When you try to save everyones ass, being a bad neighbour is the last thing you concerned about." This is a good explanation as to why some Dwellers don't like the Brotherhood; a few Responders had recorded their thoughts on the poor relations with the Appalachian Brotherhood chapter, as an example
---
Wallace and a eyebot named Gromit. Gromit takes shelter in harper ferrys train station and Wallace stays in the middle of harpers ferry.
---
It's part of a random pool of events. They are all over the map. You probably have seen a lot of them. It's the same locations as the Insult Bot, Mr. Messenger, and now all the f*king settler and raider people that need water or ammo. 
---
It will be lone animal around level 20ish. The only exception being a scorched death claw, they appear level 90 but revert to level 20 at your camp.
---
A lot of us finish events almost as soon as they pop up. My team will do 3 Queens and an Encrypted if the server does well on the first Queen. The servers are definitely slowing down in terms of players though from what I can see. I see a lot of the same names now days. It will get busy again with new content though. Always does. Next week is the new Colossus event, so people will log in and begin doing things again then.
---
PTS just went live.
---
Yeah definitely!
---
Yeah I don't like leaving my tent there anyway. Only leave it inside the nuke zone so I can fast travel inside.
---
I did that. I have him hanging over my firepit, so everyone can sit around while he slow roasts.
---
That would be handy yeah!
---
Was hoping for a cool animation or something... but nah. lol. Was also hoping for *SOMETHING* to happen when I passed Zorbo, but alas. lol.
---
Welp
---
You just reminded me that I forgot to do my dailies today
---
That's another thing, for people with mental health issues it's a big feckin struggle to keep up with daily tasks
---
Yes, near the closed fissure site west of watoga and south of foundation
---
I sell quite a lot to high end players.
---
I've got three vendors. Apart from a few exceptions, everything is sold at half the suggested price when you add it to the machine.
---
Chems and ammo in one.
---
5.56, 5mm, .50 and .45 ammo is the ammo that sells the quickest.
---
As for chems, any of the performance drugs like Psycho, Fury, Overdrive, Grape Mentats etc. tend to sell fairly quickly.  Dont bother trying to sell Rad-X, RadAway, Stimpacks or Super Stimpacks. Stimpacks especially will just collect dust. Only had one player buy any, it's simply not worth having two hundred pounds of Stimpacks taking up space.
---
Another vendor sells plans alone. High level players tends to buy the Jetpack plans and the odd Ultracite/Prime plan.
---
Third vendor is just bulk goods, probably my best earning machine. Just stock it with bulk material you've gathered and crafted, and you'll make bank from selling stuff. Naturally things like wood and glass wont sell quick, but now and then you'll get some whale taking your entire inventory, for some reason.
---
it's always some low level event too, so you get low XP from the mobs and the event itself and end up waiting another hour for something to roll around. Even worse when it's something Radiation Rumble or Arktos but nobody goes to it, so all you can do is farm mobs with a low chance of getting that completion XP.
---
That and some events are busted or buggy. 
---
* it's a trap has a high chance of not spawning a beast to fight.
---
* feed the people sometimes doesn't spawn all canisters, so you can't fill the machine and have to bail.
---
* Swarm of Suiters will sometimes just spawn the horde on the objective, so you fail immediately
---
* The Messenger can get stuck on a simple rock or log that you can basically walk over, but his path finding forces him to just sit there
---
And so on, which sucks because when you need XP for the repeatable and the daily+weekly level up, it can be hard to accomplish when you have to run the same path back to back to farm xp and hope somebody hasn't already cleaned them out while you were on the way or at another spot.
---
A feature that would save a set of cards and allow faster switching between them, instead of switching multiple cards one at a time.  Should have been there from the start, but according to them, it's still 'a long way off'.
---
If you can could you give me the location of it
---
I made a short video showing the path I take, maybe it can be helpful for you and others:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvYosA44TWE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvYosA44TWE&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
wendigo colossus will have more health and also there will be a timer to kill him before de cavern collapse, like the main event where you have to defend some protectrons in one mine
---
Appreciate the sentiment. I'm just venting so thanks for listening to me complaining.
---
I like there being dailies, you just shouldn’t need to do all of them to complete your season.  I do wish they were all completable in one mode and that they were less repetitive and maybe a mix of score and atoms but we can dream eh.  I didn’t see people complaining about dailies existing when they were for atoms.

Yesterday I ate my 200+ sugar bombs I’ve been saving for a while and I regret losing that collection immensely.

Damned if I know I usually log in and out well past the rollover as it is very early in the morning in my time zone.
---
Always down. Mr Drum Dad
---
you'd probably be better off just getting an acid resource and farming lead. It's slow using an extractor. grabbing the various weights from around the map gets you a lot of lead.

or vice versa
---
YOU KILLED HIM, DUDE!
---
My suggestion would be this.. (inspired by DAoC housing/similiar feature).
---
Create a new NPC/computer - that would let you search/view the vendor inventory of all players currently on the server.  You wouldn't be able to buy from them - but search for items.
---
Put that in one place in the world - along with other amenities - and I think you got your natural hub.
---
Not to mention is is only 100 points which is a tiny compared to an entire day's worth of dailies.
---
seen at least one post in the last 5 months mentioning the same thing.
---
This is what we've been told, yes. The PTS just went live and people are downloading it now, so we'll know exactly how it works before the end of the day.
---
Thank you, thank you
---
y tho
---
That's interesting. I bet it is a worse grind than catching up on the Legendary Run. I am hopeful it's any of those options and not health related.
---
theres a halloween costume pirate outfit. it was exclusive to the Mischif Night event, if i recall. should be back next halloween.
---
Easy solution is to dedicate more time and resources to the next run since it’s something everyone takes part in
---
It's just weird to not see any updates. Hoping he's okay.
---
Tank Killer: Pistols now benefit from the Tank Killer Perk Card.  Nice, unforeseen addition.
---
So, adding to this from what I said yesterday: the Daily Ops are up on the PTS and one of the Mutations (a feature in Daily Ops that applies to every mob in there) is "Resilient." It's effect is: "Enemies can only be killed by a melee attack."  
---
So it would seem someone in Development is agreeing with the idea of "Don't nerf builds, just make difficult content."  
---
I look forward to trying this and am glad I still have my All Rise.
---
I just wanna know how you got this picture, or how long it took to get
---
Ahhhh I was taking a break last year around that time thanks for the info man!
---
...have you tried actually shooting the thing? the tooltip damage does *not* reflect its performance.
---
Don’t forget that it’s an explosive energy gun so it’s damage numbers don’t accurately shown in the pipboy. If you have the beam splitter on as well the dps is actually way better then the gat gun
---
[or DON’T kill it, fuckin’ eggs come out their asses!](https://youtu.be/_pDTiFkXgEE)
---
Cheers! They've talked about the multiplayer side of it, but not solo players oddly enough. When does it become public?
---
Don't even know what the Legendary Run is at this point. Kinda gave up on 76 after 1500+ hours and level 430 because they just didn't add anything that was interesting to me with the new content coming out this year. It's all just a checklist and meaningless grind that you can buy with points if you want instead. Hope he's doing OK as well. But yeah, take it from me... he's probably just taking a well earned break.
---
I cant play on weekends.
---
If you are good about plopping down camps, you deny everyone else the chance to build there, it's a really good oppurtunity to grab a massive advantage that people just don't for some reason
---
[Building can also lead to hilarious teamwhipes](https://streamable.com/eou107)
---
I bet you In the Pines isn't cheap ever since Nirvana covered it. Just sayin.
---
immersion ? Realism ? inability to choose a weapon and stick to it ? All of the above ?
---
You need to mod it with beam splitter to make it shine. 
---
Please note legacies always look bad on paper, they deal more damage in real world usage than the pip boy would lead you to believe.
---
Sometimes the ghouls at Whitesprings will glitch when you kill them and be frozen in spot. So I always try and take fun posed pictures with them. 
---
Once there was one frozen on fire and that was a fun pic.
---
Even as a FO1st member, in a Private server, I get a fuck ton of lag.
---
This is the exact wording taken from the PTS post that just went up.  
---
* Creature levels throughout Appalachia will now adjust up or down on the fly to more closely match the character level of each player they encounter.
---
   * This means that the creature’s level, stats, damage, loot, and XP now all simultaneously adjust to each player that comes across them.
---
   * For example, imagine you are level 300 and your friend is level 20 while fighting the legendary Fasnacht Megasloth. 
---
      * The Sloth, having a minimum level of 20 and a maximum level of 100 will appear to be level 20 to your friend and level 100 to you.
---
      * The damage you deal to, and damage you take from Sloth will be as if the creature was level 100. Likewise, your friend will deal and take damage as if it was level 20.
---
      * On death, the Sloth will also drop max-level loot and award more XP to you. Your friend will also receive loot and XP appropriate to their level.
---
* These changes will open up many more opportunities to adventure anywhere in Appalachia together with your friends, regardless of any level gaps between you.
---
* Additionally, they will make events like Encryptid, Scorched Earth, etc., accessible to many more players, who can now have a more meaningful impact on the outcome of the event without jeopardizing the difficulty.
---
* One Wasteland also gives higher-level players more reasons to revisit previously lower-level areas, since creature XP and loot will scale up to better match their character level.
---
* Finally, One Wasteland helps smooth out some of the sudden difficulty jumps when newer characters venture away from the Forest into other regions.
---
Honestly just imagine what's it going to be like for them.
---
you just crossed the US to find Your chosen base of operations full decked out for you, a Fan boy recruit who did it, an old lady rocking a leather jacket saying you need to drink Nuka-Cola My Blood's In It to avoid the plague (who's also technically the senior member of the Appalachia brotherhood chapter now), and just a bunch of Vault dwellers who either are cosplaying as BoS members or just completely hates your guts.
---
The pip boy doesn’t show accurate damage. The explosive effect causes way more damage then is shown
---
Yeah someday i just want to do anything than grinding daily challenges, especially when they are exactly the same.
---
Yes but where was that particular random event?
---
I've farmed quite a few and have yet to find a tameable Chicken.
---
I like to turn my tv on full sound and let them fuckers chant their evil summons.
---
Well, we do know that they bailed during a major time of need for the community they were trying to protect. They also coerced said community for supplies, all documented on terminals and tapes. So it isn't to hard to develop an impression of them at this point.
---
It sounds great "on paper"... but I'm not sure that 76 is ready for the amount of "grief control" that would be needed for some thing like that yet. I like the idea though, for sure!
---
Hey us carnivores love spoiled meat
---
This is exactly what I hoped for!
---
I kinda hope WE don't have to, ya know? Like maybe just say that the Overseer or something gave them the vaccination. Would be tiring if we have to help the locals not get themselves infected. I am not their boot lick..
---
Currently flagged for Patch 22, so early September barring any setbacks or changes.
---
No exact date given, but some time next month.
---
I was only doing 22 dam per shot on the SBQ last night
---
I'm really excited for those Mutations, and just pleased to be able to go back to Vault 94.
---
2 hours per day is what Bethesda stated they was aiming for on the legendary run this is 10 hours per week not including the weekends and this is only for the legendary run 
---
Then there is the weekly
---
I'm sorry but even a die hard fan has there limits and this is a joke it's not a mobile game so why did they start modeling on one
---
I'm not going to get caught up in this cash grab urgency they have created when normal games let you reach the goals in your own time even if it takes longer
---
These are just greedy practices set up just to hide the lack of end game content that they are unwilling to provide as long as they have there die hard few defending them
---
I was once one of the defenders of this game but there laziness is getting beyond a joke
---
I paid for this game I brought lots of atoms I got my yearly subscription and for what so they can now remove my valuable time from my real life
---
Please dont accuse me about bitching as this game is becoming a ridiculous drain on everybody's time and dont presume you know anything about me or my gameplay but I can probably assure you my main character is probably higher than yours and I do have most of everything I want from the game but what I dont want is to allow this developer to think it is ok to make you spend 2 hours per day just to keep up with the game
---
What are the unique rewards?
---
and those thread links don't work.
---
It is nice to know that they are turning other locations into semi-dungeons too!
---
Well we know from tapes and letters that were demanding and completely refused to make good with the Responders (demanding ammunition and supplies from people) to the point where they eventually got wiped out rather than work with anyone.
---
I'm pretty happy with not trusting their thieving ways...They can demand all they want from me when they come, I think I'll let my artillery answer.
---
They spawn all over the place, honestly I’m surprised you haven’t noticed them before. One spot I can think of off the top of my head is the top of the monorail, sometimes the green one with the star spawns there.
---
It worked for me, and I could use the distraction.
---
I'd love to have a permanent private server I could pay for - to do significantly more building.  Let me build my own towns.  And then setup some way that I could let people come visit perhaps.  Ideally it would allow for more than 8 players;  perhaps a compromise of 16.
---
I'm just not sure there is enough of a market to justify the investment
---
I think I'm seeing a pattern here :P
---
Feels like all your chances to win a fight is that something "extraordinary" will occur (not trying to offend you by any means). Or a Scorchbeast will spawn and kill everyone for you, or someone else will kill them while you are hiding... but you can't rely on your "luck" all the time. Maybe nothing of that happens, maybe someone starts a fight that you didn't want to start or you couldn't afford because you weren't looting during all match... and then is when you will need a better gear. And also everything else you said. Is a mix of everything: luck, creativity...  but most importantly having good gear. There's too much difference between somebody who have been all match flying around taking all the orange crates and somebody who just got a few blue crates.
---
I always have in mind those bush campers. I don't get it. Yeah, you can hide all match and get to the final zone basically doing nothing, but you can't play that game forever. At some point somebody will find you, and believe me, when they actually find you you'll be dead before you even realize you are getting shot. You could have had a chance if you did anything else than just camping in a bush. Yeah, maybe Gods are on your side that day and something "extraordinary" happens, but as I said "luck only" ain't a reliable way to win.
---
Maybe for that people making it to the top 10 is a win, idk, but if I play I play to win (I have to admit that sounded better in my head). I suppose we just have different playstyles.
---
It certainly sounds pretty positive, as far as balancing goes.
---
Now during the stream, they did say something to the effect of "Some enemies'll have a lower limit, and some won't change at all." Specifically mentioning the Queen as someone whose level is fixed.
---
So if you're fresh from the Vault, the Cranberry Bog should still be a little too much, but you're not going to get pulverized for walking by Black Water Mine anymore.
---
I have farmed 50 plus pets and just 1 chicken. It's just RNG. Not one spot is different from the other.
---
What no
---
Reading those Daily Ops mutations as a melee player:
---
&gt;Resilient: Enemies can only be killed by a melee attack
---
😀
---
&gt;Freezing Touch: Enemies will freeze players while attacking in close proximity
---
😦
---
rip to stealth players with that Piercing Gaze mutation though lol. I wonder how powerful it'll be.
---
That’s where I live 😢
---
It sounds like they are BOS themed missions so I'd think some new and old BOS rewards?
---
Thank you for posting this. It actually answered a few questions I still had about it.
---
Scrapper is your friend.
---
oooooooooooooh
---
Jet will make you jittery
---
How tf is caring 1k lbs worth of crap even remotely immersive or realistic? 
---
If you were going for realism you'd at most be lugging around 50 or 60 lbs/20-30 kg.  That's the load soldiers carry into battle, any more would tire even an extremely fit human out.
---
But hey so long as you are having fun, you do you.
---
absolute mad lad
---
SBQ is essentially immune to explosive weapons. and this goes double for legacy ones.
---
put a splitter on it if you haven't already and try it on literally any other enemy. a BE GP is one of the strongest weapons in the game.
---
I think Musk Ape would be better for Appalachia. Bigfoot is more up north.
---
The sheep SQUACH" is a Bigfoot. A cloven hooved Bigfoot.
---
No problem. It seemed like the best way to be thorough, get the word out, and probably calm a few nerves.
---
Might help if you tell which system you use
---
That mutation either doesn't deal any damage or heals me wth
---
They were nerfed well over a year ago :-)
---
Nerfed to fuck as well :-)
---
Yeah, the links don't work on the official site yet either?
---
Salisbury Steak is a much more valuable collection, anyways. Start fresh! 😂
---
Ha!! That's perfect!
---
I usually see it drop quickly but never to 0 the first few openings. Doesn't seem to matter how much damage I do.
---
I can kill her within 5 minutes using an ultracite Gatling plasma while not sneaking.
---
These magic weapons are for people who clearly don’t know how to play. I don’t see the appeal of these weapons.
---
I hate seeing SBQ dying in seconds from this crap in public.
---
Yeah, it feels like a chore playing now
---
But guys! 3 days ago someone called me a liar for saying they didn't fix em! It has to be fixed!
---
Ok thanks. Yeah I know explosives don’t really effect the queen. My Gat Gun does high 700s-800 per shot but only really deals 193 to the queen.
---
I read it was going to work like one Tamriel over on ESO, so my hopes where kinda high. As long as they get it working right I think I’ll be more then happy with this update.
---
I like some of the choices. I mean, Burrows makes sense, and this is a nice way to bring back Vault 94, but the Burning Mine? I'm pleasantly surprised by that as it's a cool map and it'll be nice to see it used again.
---
Easiest way is move your camp even if you place it in the same spot
---
Perspective; 5 or 6k is still a lot of caps. And I’m maxed out.
---
I've gotta say I don't mind the dailies as they're a good way to get my season pass up. Although I imagine they'll get old in the near future
---
I started after the nerf and am still havin a good time with my 2 shot explosive lever rifle, also carry an explosive .50 hunting rifle as my backup.
---
... and then you got a server disconnect.
---
How it this stoping her when people build camps there and she lands on the building
---
Nerf or not, I still like using them. They're fun and go poppoppoppop
---
Sounds like despite to me.
---
carrying that  much is absolutely not. But more the walking. I enjoy the journeys across the map. Th planning it has to take, to get everything I want done.
---
Instead of vanilla meta soul crush no imagination grinding...you could try doing something novel.... I've been finding all the dopest swag cause I'm not some derp "wha....???? The DMs aren't rewarding me for my overplayed, 1.million youtube guides play style?"

Even with the explosive defense on the queen, a BE plasma gat with beam splitter tears her a new asshole.
---
Not until the sever was taken down for maintenance
---
I’d rather see some other creature added. Also Bigfoot is more NW area of America
---
You're a savior! 
---
it honestly wasn’t that bad, only time i went down a bunch was the room with the rads, because i don’t use PA and had to get rid of my armor for a hazmat suit. other than glitching and only having three sections chiefs actually do their job and having to server hop and restart i enjoyed it, ended up killing the sbq as well, had help from one there guy but bloodied is really op
---
So stealth is out the window...and melee might be needed...so everyone get on the bloody melee bandwagon?
---
Be good to see hear how these all work in practice - hopefully it still allows lots of different builds.
---
The answer is don't swap out starched genes. I have 14 luck, so I may have more swapping options than you, but I just drop crit savvy for super duper when I need it

The listing of mod support on pc gamepass is about user created mods, you can read it [here](https://twitter.com/zerofoxfk/status/1290978956389253121?s=21) 
---
“only install from developers you trust” is not about official bethesda mods, that’s about third party (i.e. user created) mods
---
“Xbox live features might not work in modded games”
---
“Mod content is not rated”
---
Those are all warnings you see about third party/user created mods, not official creation club/bethesda created mods
---
Most Interesting is the Xbox live features not working, makes me think they’re expecting the inevitable single player offline mod
---
Leave me some spoiled meat and I just turn it into fertilizer to use for my crops. Thanks!!
---
As someone who has played with both an HDD and an SSD i can say it makes a HUGE difference. When spawning in a crowded area being the 1st to the orange stashes is the difference between life and death
---
WHITE POWERRR
---
I've faced it three times, defeated twice. The first time I defeated it was with a second player. That time it took about 45 minutes, we were helped by luring it out toward the firebase and a scorched joined in to help us.  The second time there were 3 of us and it went much more quickly. Regardless of firepower I think a couple extra players helps to distract the colossus and to clean up any wendigo spawn.
---
Also the second time we only got the scream thing once which was odd...
---
Oof. I've had things glitch like that when I'm moving things around and if it just goes invisible, hopping servers fixes it, but if it's actually underground like you're saying, you'll probably have to rebuild. I'd try switching servers though, in case it like squeezes it out somehow.
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
So is it a private test server again?
---
Also I will say this again, daily ops sound awesome
---
Is my dream jobs...write quest for Rpg...
---
Thanks for the info! Hopefully they scale the finale Wastelanders mission that I am currently struggling with at a lvl53 character, siding with the Raiders. 
---
Main issue seems to be the damn turrets and OP Assaultrons!
---
Alright, that's cool xD Now I need to try that. But that will never be better than a grenade + vats. That's the ultimate team wiper ;)
---
Vouch. 100 minimum on me at all times
---
Lol yeah they are still fun. Might have to get rid of that shotgun though because it is terrible
---
Awesome build!
---
hope this helps  
---
http://imgur.com/a/6UB5etS
---
yeah, huge bummer, I wanted to share some nukashine from the stash, guess not at least for some time
---
You would absolutely love Death Stranding.
---
Can we see the individual Score season 2 rewards from the board even if we can’t claim them? Might influence whether or not I’ll download 75 gb again.
---
Edit: Season datamined https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9t3zv/update_22_pts_atx_and_score/
---
Then you have a reason to buy low lvl pipe guns from vendors, see they are just fixing things
---
I been playing since wastelander dlc  and there is so much to do in this game especially when you play with other and a set group of friends 
---
I used to play FFXIV , eso and classic wow before I jump on wastelander  ofcourse this game doesn’t compare to an mmorpg but it still an active grind
---
Disagree.
---
I think they goofed.  The welcome page states this:  
---
Hi everyone,
---
Thank you very much for joining us and welcome to in the Fallout 76 Public Test Server (PTS)! 
---
Use this forum to share your feedback and bug reports with us about your experiences while you play test new content in the PTS. We greatly appreciate your help in play testing all of our upcoming content so that we can address issues and make necessary tweaks before we release our next patch.
---
My guess is the Resilient mutation just means we can shoot everything down to 1HP and then gun bash them to finish them off. But we'll see soon enough.
---
On Xbox? 🤓 I'd take it off ya hands
---
Yeah let's see the Season 2 Board, boys.
---
They did the same thing inside the vault
---
Sadly Bethesda isn’t trailblazing here, they are followers, as this seems to be more of a standard practice.  Cosmetics = content, to some.
---
How come in what way
---
I think I have a pic of the dude working on it while there was another dude right in front of him and he was hammering the other dudes ass.  it was awkward....
---
I was wondering this as well, can you see the rewards?
---
I'm pretty sure at least some pet types are based on the region their spawn point falls under. 
---
I havent, for instance, ever seen tamable mirelurk kings spawn in the mountains where I once found a rad rat pup spawn. And have yet to find a tameable deathclaw north east of the map, where a tabable rabbit once spawned for me.
---
Same goes with some of the random encounters themselves,  where some never seem to spawn in certain regions.
---
I've seen lost super mutants spawn several times in the north east, but never in the mountains.
---
So knowing what region you happened to spot a particular creature would help to shave off hours if not days worth of farming.
---
I've actually never had vats grenades work for me haha, vats misses nonstop or the grenade doesn't go where it said it'd go
---
I've had more success by surprising enemies with my blueprint that spawns a platform covered in portable toilets with me hiding inside one lmao
---
I leveled really quickly by doing events while in a team,  radiation rumble, transcendental meditation and line in the sand would get me several levels , just focus on tagging , most high levels will know what you are doing and let you get a few shots in.
---
(Some are complete dicks and won’t.. just move to another vantage point!)
---
☹️ no good deed goes unpunished, and all that.
---
I get the battle pass/premium thing but they kinda hyped it ina way that new content was being delivers like  missions or whatever
---
The legendary run is a great feature that is added content. You don’t have to do it. 
---
I know it’s surprising you could play the game completely ignoring it.
---
in every way
---
Thanks for actually answering instead of downvoting me for as asking a legit question. Cuz i was in the same boat but way early on. Didnt like how grindy it was. I dont mind a good grind i love OSRS but mu god was this just not fun
---
I don't pay any attention to the complaining of min/maxers who go around running an op bloodied meta build that play 12 hours a day server hopping grinding a level 300 character they made last week, and then say they're bored.
---
All set.
---
Upvoted for fat beat
---
But they prioritised it ahead of actual gameplay
---
It's the evil chicken from OSRS. He'll kill us all!
---
Right....thanks for that intellectual discussion
---
I've got a lot of time in this game my friend. I've been in endgame guilds, DM'd campaigns for an RP group, ranked up in a unique discord group that rewarded certain game-play elements, built dozens of lore-based camps, PvP'd, developed specific builds for specific endgame events, learned from the best queen killers and aided the noob-iest of noobs.
---
I wasn't asking for spoods420's opinion on my gameplay, I was asking if there had been a noticeable change in spawns and event timing in the past few months.
---
Does progress from the PTA carry over? So if i level up and stuff?
---
Ok that makes a lot more sense
---
you can disagree it's pathetic I suppose. but everything else is spot on.
---
Some don’t have pictures yet but you can read what’s supposed to be there. Maybe a certain building wall set people have been asking for since beta.
---
My only issue is I still want to be able to get the level up daily challenge, so may need to take my time with this character. 
---
... or I’ll just convert one of my other characters. I’ll play on here once I do what I want to do, but I think it will be fun.
---
It's not about luck it's about using every advantage the game gives you, as it presents it to you 
---
You also have more advantage by spawning a camp build that's like a huge fort or something 
---
9 times out of ten SOMEONE will shoot at it which gives away their position 
---
Leading to other squads targeting them 
---
Allowing you to pick off the distracted squads yourself, that's how I've won tons of solo queue games
---
Gear really isn't that much of an advantage in this game, it really doesn't change the time to kill at all
---
You can still get oneshot by stuff like a gauss shotgun or literally any rifle single shot sniper  build
---
People are downvoting this for no real reason. I don't know what causes quest items to not be removed but it's certainly a real bug that happens. I've never seen anyone able to explain what makes it happen, but I own a few quest items like that which I've bought from player vendors. My favorite is all 3 of the blood samples, 2 of which are now legacy since they were removed from the quest.
---
And for everyone saying it's a hack or a mod you're wrong, it's just a bug with the game that causes items to lose their quest item flag. It's exactly the same as how you can get Ward's quest items and not have them removed after turning in the quest.
---
The people who do cosmetic is completely separate form the people working on gameplay. Ofc they could move them over but as it is right now is a good mix between cosmetic and gameplay.
---
Money doesn’t fall from trees and running servers is expensive as hell.
---
I'm definitely  one of these people I grind more than 100 events a day if possible. I'm trying to get the rare outfits but having no luck with it.
---
But there’s no new gameplay how is that a healthy mix
---
Explosive is still one of the most desirable secondary legendary effects (the other being +25% faster fire rate). Two-shot is not longer that great, and is even worse on a shotgun (it adds 1 projectile, so you go from 8 to 9 pellets). Shotguns in general were also nerfed.
---
Maybe not Bigfoot but I am all for having more Cyptids in the game. I love the mystery.
---
Question: how do you have so many bobbleheads?
---
"I see you have our missing property."
---
\*Nuke comes flying in\*
---
Well one: it's not a battle pass. You don't pay extra money to play it, it's just there for you to do or not.
---
Two: please provide a source which states that the Seasons feature would ever be more than what it is now.
---
You may be confusing it with stuff like Daily Ops or expeditions, I've never seen it advertised as anything more than revamped daily/weekly challenges for new rewards
---
Lol sure my gt is same as my reddit name
---
Wouldn't it be nice if they offered something cool in addition to the weekly challenges rewards to make you want to log in daily instead of being forced to?  What are your thoughts?
---
Then you are blind to what gameplay is.
---
The other day, I started my Retirement plan daily and noticed the raider was directly at Fissure site prime, in a nuke zone! I also noticed 3 people chasing the raider. It was a 3\* legendary raider and when I got there the 3 people were just running with the guy, and then we all tagged him and killed him.
---
I don't know why they didn't just kill him ASAP, but I thank them for not bugging out my daily by killing him!
---
So two shots were nerfed? What if it's only 2 shot and not explosive also
---
Is that the Norman Reedus game ? With the baby ?
---
By level 25 I was the god of the Commonwealth. I could get anywhere, kill anything. Anyone. Mirelurks were little cunts, even at level 100+!
---
Damn chill out coming here like a lawyer I’m just think it’s a load of bollocks there these challenges as subsitutes for gameplay
---
you say that as if the only reason why we don't have dedicated, local servers is that Bethesda's entire revenue model is reliant on the very fact we're tethered to their horrible services.
---
My list

* Green Thumb (?) crafting more food (P)
---
If you knew then why were you wondering why it was dealing so little damage?
---
Also there's no "maybe" with the scorchbeast 
---
It spawns every game i think around the 5th to last circle, it also does much more damage than scorchbeasts typically do
---
🤣 in what way did my response come off as being not chill? Because I disagreed with you? Haha
---
If you're on ps4 let me help you kind vault dweller.
---
Seeing as how the exact same Wiki contradicts itself with the entry for Fredrick Rivers (supporting my point), I'm disinclined to accept the version in your source.  Especially as none of the references they list support what is written, also it reads like somebody's bad fanfiction.  Here's my source: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Frederick\_Rivers](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Frederick_Rivers)
---
As an aside, I didn't downvote you.  It doesn't show up on my screen like that at all.  Just because we disagree doesn't mean I'm trying to be a dick.
---
&gt; "But you don't need every reward, the stuff at the end of the run is for those hardcore players that are able to dedicate more time to the SCORE grind. That's kind of the point of it being a challenge" - /u/IIHawkerII
---
and 
---
&gt; "What i don't understand are people who say rewards are only for people who play every day. If someone plays 12 hours over saturday and sunday, how is that less hardcore than someone who plays one hour a day, every day? "
---
The problem is agree with both of you. What's a real solution for both answers?
---
troubleshooters effect is your friend..
---
also aiming for the leg...
---
Do u not see your text
---
Junk walls to add to our junk fences?  I can only hope.  :)
---
Ooooo professional gamer analyst here
---
Apologies, I had no idea intellectual discussion is what you were after.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa](https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa)
---
I don't see any numbers attached to those "guesstimates" you said.
---
Again, I'm going to say the opposite. More people like the game and it's direction than you think. A majority in fact.
---
Since when is chewing bubblegum for 1000 caps to buy more bubblegum gameplay
---
Generally agree with you;  though I'm a new player - I see this having a lot of longevity.
---
But - they need to change these daily limits;  either removing the cap, increasing it, or moving it to weekly.  Ideally a combination of both.
---
Change scrip to a 5,000/week limit (up from 150 day, or 1050/week).  As it stands right now - I have 3000lbs or so of legendaries on mules just waiting to script.  It may also make sense to lower some of the values - or the cost to buy higher.
---
Similiar to bullion;  change it to say - a 5k/week limit.  (today being 1400/week, or 200 a day).
---
Both got substantially nerfed (see https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2J2ong0O2B6GAI1AeIdGcp/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-29-2019), but explosive was so good to start with that even after the nerf it's still really good.
---
Little tip for the gain a level daily. Make a new toon. Leave the vault. Wander down to the overseers camp and that should be enough for kevel 3. 1-2 doesnt award the the level up. Then delete the toon and repeat the next day if your nowhere near a level on your main
---
Yep, you could theoretically have 5 skills at 15, with 11 points to spare. From what the devs said, this is supposed to be the solution to needing more alternative build accounts basically. Already planned my buffs out so I can run a bloodied fixer and unarmed wep and not see any major dmg drop switching in combat.
---
I'll be on in about an hour, I'll look for you 😄
---
Oof man, you're sensitive...sharing your opinion and get all uppity if someone disagrees with you.
---
"Thanks for that intellectual discussion"
---
He’s just trying to stay positive 😂
---
all those facts tho
---
Sweep the legs!
---
Good point - that would work. My sniper really isn't built for up close...more very very long range :)
---
Pretty sure during a stream it happened to a dev and the look on their face musta been priceless
---
Despite? Is that the right word you were looking for?
---
Pretty sure the data mine would have to exist for them to do that. As of rn there is nothing solidly stated as part of the "armor ace" Season.
---
I was able to do it like 3 days ago with an explosive fixer. Not sure what other conditions were just right that Beth may have overlooked but they fell off and counted toward the progress bar.
---
Nope
---
pray to the gorillas, maybe they can help
---
...I said so myself it wasn't absolute proof. are you even reading my posts?
---
however, everything so far points to me being right. what evidence do *you* have of the opposite?
---
Well fucks sake
---
Whoa, changes to the way damage bonuses are calculated ?! Angry Turtle you know what you need to do.
---
What if it has the whole thing from fallout 4s survival mode where if you don't stimpack them in time when they're knocked down they perma die tho 
---
;_;
---
It happened to LadyDevon the community manager
---
I thought it was a developer.... but still
---
Pm'd you my username
---
I'd like just a flat color skin for the combat and scout armors myself
---
Yeah you're right...facts are so lame. Why can't we all just accept our opinions as fact and disregard any other viewpoint? It's be a much better world 🥴
---
I use Steam if you mean that
---
Tame place other animals? 🙂
---
It is?
---
They fell off for me and counted toward the progress bar in real time, but not sure what other conditions were just right that Beth may have overlooked. I only did it once, tho.
---
isn't the PTS stuff allowed to be publicly discussed?
---
Hot damn, is that a power armor display!?
---
I would too
---
Thank you very much. Wait just looked through season 2 I can’t imagine all that stuff is solely for the season
---
Total guess, yes. Would tie in with existing assets and provide a variety of choices for different play styles.
---
It’s a public test build. Not private anymore.
---
Interesting, thank you for the info. I hope they include what mods are working before we join a p-server.
---
Yeah it's a bit silly tbh.  Do it or don't, but please don't complain about the hardships you endured after the fact ESPECIALLY if you already identified early on that it "isn't worth it" for you, as many people keep stating.
---
I doubt it cuz crater and foundation dont have a scrip exchange but if new gold bullion items are added for them there will probably be one
---
He's not, OP's version of intellectual discussion is "agree with me or you're wrong"
---
You work fast, gears. You and your internet - I'm barely 5GB into the download.
---
Edit: ayyy greenhouse structures and commie armor skins are in the SCORE gallery, that means I don't have to pay for em =D i'll spend those Atoms on the new display items instead!
---
TY
---
Also disappointed here, but not much because it gave me fertilizer, but why a small thing like a chicken pen took so much of my budget space. Yet another asset that I will have to scrap.
---
Sounds like a lot of issues a dedicated server would fix
---
Yes! Also that fucking windmill and the fusiongenerator pls
---
Dont think they would have any, story wise with wastelanders atleast
---
Totally agree with you. This season has almost fully taken the joy out of 76. So much so, that I have cxled my 1st membership and seriously dont know if I would attempt the season 2. 
---
Give us dailies for atoms and weekly's for season.
---
That’s not going to help change anything
---
I'm a new player and can't progress on the story line because of this... So now what am I suppose to do? I tried the solution of logging out and back in, getting the sample and fuse.. But still nothing. 
---
Really annoying and frustrating.
---
Sounds like a nerf for XP to bold and daring low level players?
---
If you're talking about crouch spamming that's just how we say hello or express hype
---
Wow. Some of those prizes are fantastic. Legit hype.
---
That's their way of artificially expanding the life of the current bullion items and making sure the weapon market isn't oversaturated with god tier weapons. (Which is why dupes are big no no) It makes sense, but can be frustrating when you've got the means to progress but can't due to a barrier like that. It's like a speed limit. You can go faster, but you'll only enjoy going that fast until something goes wrong. It's just too easy to get notes and legendaries to trade for those currencies, and I can only imagine they have future plans for the bullion system since it was such a big deal that currency was introduced. Also, they never intended for one character to have ALL of those items. Either way, I get where you're coming from but they do have a reason for those limits.
---
They can't be combat pets. They would just follow you around like in ESO. Having them in combat would be an unfair advantage.
---
Or having my favorite, hardly-to-show-up event come up at the same time that another player calls in a nuke.
---
Not being effected but spiteful he dont have one
---
I think you are confusing the season with the other stuff on the roadmap. Daily ops will probably provide more of what you are looking for, same with the upcoming colossal problem and meat week events.
---
You keeping an eye on your compass fello survivor?
---
Accidentally did this with a turret in a tree.
---
Hilarious :)
---
For me, it was getting totally wiped. I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who hasn’t been permanently banned or left unscathed. I duped for the little people who expressed their frustration at not being able to get good or even mediocre stuff despite the mass duping event. So B2525 fixers went for 2000 caps, explosive laser rifles for 500, and explosive gatling plasmas for 3500. Sentinel assassin combat armor sets were 6000 caps apiece. If they had the caps, then they paid up. If they didn’t, I have them a free B2525 fixer. Everyone who came to see me walked away with good gear, happy, and able to defend themselves against the workshop PvPers. The odds of getting a B2525 fixer from the purveyor is roughly 1/55000. It is *ridiculously* hard to get anything good. Half of them didn’t even have a complete set of the armor type they wanted for crying out loud! About 1/3 didn’t have a legendary gun worth keeping. Only one had a rare outfit, and he wanted me to take that instead of caps. I met him halfway, and duped it. I gave him the original back. Mutual exchange, I called it. Poor bastard didn’t think it was fair, that I gave him all that stuff and he couldn’t pay me back.
---
You are not a Pro owner by any chance ?
---
Buying from people vendors
---
You might try leader of the pack. You are guaranteed 3 legendaries that drop lower level gear that you can use for script.
---
Wow someone just posted a short bit ago about wanting a hammock and here it is lol
---
I don't know if you meant to say "so much" or "not much" but I can confirm that adding some personality to your session can make all the difference. Just make sure you surround yourself with creative people who enjoy the game for what it is AND what it could be.
---
Yeah, but its spawn is random. Maybe it spawns next to you and starts screaming at you as soon as it spawns, or maybe it spawns next to the other remaining player giving away his position.
---
No, I meant PC/XBox/PS, but I guess Steam tells us it is PC :-)
---
I do this occasionally to people. They proceed to greet me back in the appropriate manner.
---
Oki thank.
---
It'll probably be a combination of the limited ps4 mods and creation club mods, wouldn't expect anything that changes scripts or adds anything new, will probably work with existing assets.
---
I like the dailies and the weeklies. I can't play every day, but when I do get a chance I usually complete the dailies and weeklies in one sitting.
---
That took balls.
---
Which is why I come back to - at a minimum - at least turn it into a weekly limit.
---
That way - I can "play" for real for 2-3 days.  And then go play another game or something.  Rather than logging in a little bit at a time.
---
I just really hate the micromanagement of the legendaries.  Heck - a good uranium fever, you are over 50% of your scrip quota for the day.
---
Is there a clip ? i need to see this
---
cool ty :\].
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
I'm pretty sure this gonna be mostly available for private server, especially if we can have mods that change scripts, add function, news gears and more.
---
It's actually possible to have mods that change actual skin/meshes from something but the owner of the mods is the only one to see change.
---
I hope when they gonna add a full mods support peoples gonna post more stuff on nexus or whatever (in game section could be cool too especially if Bethesda want to do some moderation but if they try to get money from it, they can burn).
---
Yeee
---
If all goes well, you'll hopefully be alright.
---
I sided with the Settlers and was the low 300s when I first did that, so don't remember it being any form of difficult, otherwise I'd gladly offer specific suggestions.
---
There is some cool stuff in there! Disappointed it seems they are doubling down on the armor/power armor like they did this season (though I like the armor a lot better this time around)
---
Todd's light will shine on thee
---
It's a nonverbal hello basically. Just a player being friendly.
---
Too bad it cant be obtainable anymore. Thank for the info.
---
The fact that the game is shifting away from what you want and closer to what I want.
---
Yea but these armor paints are 100% better in my opinion and that BoS bunker prefab is amazing
---
Server hopping helped, found the bowl in the "stored" category, now the shrine is complete!
---
I wish
---
So how will we be able to obtain these displays?
---
It must be rare to see 15 tents though because I don't think I've ever seen 15 players at SBQ.
---
one: the game has always been like that.
---
two: that's evidence that Bethesda is using mobile tactics to generate more revenue, not that the playerbase enjoys that direction.
---
the playerbase is in fact very vocal about *not* enjoying the grind.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
---
In all seriousness, They can’t even fix the issues with the friends list synching correctly. I doubt there will be any enhancements. Likely issues but not enhancements.
---
Didn’t know that, thank you!
---
Interesting, looks like I'll be dropping WesTek from my nightly run to level for SCORE.
---
No that’s just you. Probably a robot that is linked to you.
---
I thought I was in the VALORANT sub. Same issue, different game.
---
What if BOS only came to Appalachia when they heard that vault dwellers found a lot of gold?
---
This way it could be integrated in the story
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I disagree. Me and my friends play this on Saturday, and only Saturday for 3-4 hours. So while we might not have the opportunity to complete many weekly challenges we can at least get a single daily set completed for the week and maybe an easy weekly challenge or two. Just because you and some others aren’t able to profit on every daily, doesn’t mean they hold no value to anyone else.
---
Yeah I use PC :D
---
I saw comparisons to that, but I always took that to be more a familiar point of reference than a certainty.
---
I'm intrigued to see how the rewards'll actually scale beyond the obvious stuff like legendaries being max/near max level.
---
Will the Super Mutants at the Dam, for example, have a better chance of spawning with a minigun, or at least 5 mm now?
---
Will Mole Miners in Uranium Fever have far more slugs on them?
---
How will this effect the more menial rewards in comparison to the "added work" to kill them?
---
Y'all think that's like an Enclave jetpack or supposed to be more of an alien looking one? I could see it going either way 
---
Looks kinda like the fo4 crashed alien ship in terms of shapes at least
---
That's a good point, older content was not integrated in newer ones
---
I couldn't get it to work :p people might have had area chat turned off
---
Greenhouse wallllllls!
---
Yeah, I find some lack of consistency there. Sometimes I'm able to explode it with my first shot, and other times I could empty a full mag with 70-80% chance and never make it explode.
---
For me the best tactic is downing an enemy from the distance without finishing him. Wait until a teammate comes to revive him and then throw it. 2 for the price of 1 hehe. I feel so dirty when I do it xD
---
No, they don't know how to make an UI..... And no one gonna buy it when you can just download the .ba2 file from nexus that do the same, event better. But i agree, a fully customisable UI is what i want and peoples want.
---
There are only so many types of posts on r/76:
---
1. Does anyone else think that [insert super common opinion here]
---
2. Bethdaddy plz!
---
3. I'm quitting this stupid game and need you to know
---
4. Wow the SCORE grind sure did suck and wasn't worth it at all, i'm so happy I did it
---
The only enhancement I could see from them porting it over is faster load times. 
---
They could make the visuals better as well but that’s entirely up to them.
---
Definitely looks like it. I'm curious what paint is on the power armor, it actually looks new and shiny.
---
Brooo I haven't seen a single one. I've gone to the final minutes of the game and still nothing.
---
It will to some, and it won't to there 
---
Some people want the game to change, some are asking how they can be better
---
Some looks like Brotherhood is Steel
---
Bah armor displays as atom shop, figured as much.
---
I just hope they dont add another currency
---
Hum I dont know what you are walking about.
---
The quality is perfectly fine?
---
Looks like a much more rewarding season imo! :O
---
Ah good to know, still its a pretty awful effect currently
---
No. They said they aren't going to be looking at any enhancements.
---
Correct, and SBQ crippling removed from the event. There is some evidence that without any players in the grass to aggravate her she won't land and stay in the air since she sees the players as in the air and engages in a similar fashion. If a couple of players are in the grass by a tent she will land and walk right up to it seeing it is a ground battle. The fence mechanics are the same.
---
Lets gooo on the 51! The building thing is actually funny.
---
Vocal minority. Plenty of people don't post about the game while they enjoy it. It's a very common misconception that a majority of the players post about the game.
---
Second, they aren't using mobile tactics. They aren't putting up paywalls to progress. They don't time out the amount of levels you can gain. They don't push ads in your face to buy atoms for boosts.
---
Holy fuck i love this
---
So I zoomed in and I already knew about vault 94 being I read patch notes and watched YouTube videos. But the nw I could care less about. But still nice to see new content
---
No news (though they have announced that Doom Eternal and ESO are getting enhancements). We haven't heard much from BGS this summer, so there's a remote chance they might announce it as part of gamescom, but for now I'd presume they aren't doing anything beyond backwards compatibility, at least at the time the consoles launch.
---
It is a little blurry when ya zoom in but it was readable.  Theres always one....
---
Most of the challenges can either be done in minutes, or completed doing other things.
---
Good question. If something is convenient, I'll pay a vastly inflated price. Nuke keycards: they go for 500 caps and I'm sure if I needed one in a hurry I'd pay 1,000.
---
5.56 and .45 ammo as I'm sure you know are the best-sellers. Fusion cores priced correctly should sell solidly (no more than 1 cap per percent of charge though).
---
Really good lower level gear for alts I always need, personally. UNY armour or bloodied or AAE weapons at low levels I am always tempted by as I have lots of alt characters I'm always building up.
---
Serums you probably can't make yet but when you can they will sell for 300-500 caps each. You don't even need players to buy them as you can sell 2 or 3 for all if not a big chunk of the vendor's 1,400 daily limit. Even if you buy just one serum recipes from another player (Marsupial, Speed Demon, Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones being the most used) you can make that money back quickly. Some players sell these for much less than the 18,800 caps or so will pay out at least once you've unlocked the place where you can get them.
---
Learn what plans are in need: none of the holiday gifts rubbish - we just glaze over when we see vending machines full of those. Generally the nominal value of a plan can be an indicator of whether it is worth selling. The few I still need I'd pay a few K caps for each.
---
That's off the top of my head, good luck.
---
Yeah it's a gamble whether you decide to fight it, or play it cool with some meds 
---
Building a little shack has worked for me before, seems like he targets you less if you're inside something, but then obviously a building sticks out like a sore thumb
---
I try to have multiple blueprints from adventure mode saved for different situations like that, being able to spawn a two story house with a secret room is really handy
---
Oh I swear they better not add something new and make it even more of a grind. Add new weapons and shit but not a triple grind. I wanna have fun
---
Wait wait wait... you call them pathetic, and make claims without providing any source, and now you just want to backpedal because someone calls you out on it?
---
marked as atom shop item, may not be possible unless bethesda missed some coding
---
Alright alright, you win xD I'll just admit I'm too anxious and I'd probably get more wins if I'd actually use my brain (even that most of my matches are top 1-3. Flexing? Me? Nah xD).
---
We are flooding this thread with our discussion. I can't even follow it anymore xD
---
u/ChristinaMagder
---
Me too! I was like... WOMP WOMP
---
Omg it’s finally here! Vehicles 🚗 broom broom
---
Dummies and frames?!  
---
Oooh, this is gonna be a good day when it goes live.  
---
Also, I don't actually recognize the PA that jet pack is on. Those arms are totally unfamiliar. Do they ring a bell to anyone else?
---
Thank you
---
🤧☠️🙎🏿‍♂️
---
I too wish they don't add a new currency, but judging from past experiences... they will
---
I’m destroyed 😬😤
---
I wondered if I was hearing it because I'm in Philly, where "jawn" is supposed to be common slang. I've never heard it in the real world, though.
---
Literally no one is going to help you with exploits. Thats what youtube is for.
---
Yall need to chill out
---
BOS doesn't want gold, they want technology. They'll have a toaster vendor.
---
Honestly, I've been able to complete every challenge beside Level Up and the NW stuff like "kill # creatures" and "survive # minutes" in about 30 minutes. They said they would change the challenges to be stuff you would conceivably do every day anyway, and they were right about that. The dailies aren't that hard or time consuming to do, and I find it difficult to understand that someone doesn't have a half hour a day.  
---
That's not to say the current system is perfect, however, as they definitely need more opportunities to gain SCORE for people like that and maybe some rewards for SCORE received after hitting 100.
---
What?  Make it good?
---
No.  You get shit events with bad drops, _or you get nothing!_
---
YES. Totally ruins my "look"... cuz I need to look cool.
---
But seriously, I'd be happy to be able to turn it off. Backpack as well. Some of us like a clean look.
---
Nice!! Glad it worked out for ya!
---
Same here . I'm going out of my way to hunt them down. I've tried good old BUSH tactics and everything .
---
Yes finally someone gets it thanks
---
It was the fact that they nerfed the legendary drop rates and stopped the ghouls respawning under nukes that killed the fun.
---
I don't do dailies anymore, I don't care about the rewards, doing dailies makes me feel obligated. I enjoy my game much more without it, I can't keep up with gold bulion and challenges grinding. Weekly quests would be lovely, but I know it's utopy.
---
So looks bad ass but looks like the commie paint is replacing the ghille skins for this season and also the power armor gets the new paint. So there’s another two rewards we get multiply times. But side not which is good, is the skins actually are nice looking unlike the stupid ghille skins
---
I have a TSE Handmade. The accuracy isn't great for a rifleman build, but great for a commando. It's fun to spray bullets.
---
Everyone wants gold, you can buy anything with it, they can exchange it for old technology
---
Sounds like the kind of joke Gramps would tell. No wonder I like it.
---
I just go to there to steal their telephones
---
Ohhh a greenhouse building set.  Look like anyway
---
Excited! Something that has been massively missing from fallout 76
---
Alot to get excited about. Things looking great for season 2 👌🏼
---
I've seen a lot of people with really useful buildings. I'm a completely noob when it comes to NW building. I never use it. Reminds me of Fortnite xD
---
Same thing i said in the one post with the rewards. There’s nice rewards but they’re doing it again with the same paint for armor. But it’s so so so so much better then the dumb ghille skins
---
Hahaha I'm sorry man, I just really like NW 
---
It's so silly of a Battle royale and I love how weird it is, I try not to shut down ppls opinion but I legit play the game mode to relax because it's almost like a party game in terms of how it's set up
---
It's just alot of the silliness isn't evident to everyone, or they don't see the ways that they can spin it to their advantage, they only see the weirdness set up to hinder and frustrate them 
---
And I always worry that eventually cuz of that, Bethesda will get rid of it like they got rid of survival mode
---
So I can get more crusadey with my NW defences than i intend to haha
---
I have really bad, crippling even, anxiety as well so I understand how it is
---
If I see you in the wasteland, you're always welcome to hide in one of my toilets o7
---
It’s always were I drop my grenades first
---
Ohhh... Thank you for the new method to troll bloodied build players.  I would have never thought of this.
---
christ, applied that shit long ago, but never moved camp, started to rebuild camp, christ that suck ass... after several bug-rebuilds,  noticed no camp icon. what a BS...
---
It was nerfed to oblivion, not much can be done unless Bethesda have some plan for the area on their roadmap.
---
Nerfed to stop farming in a materials farming game... go figure? 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh my GOD that Fallout 1 BoS bunker I NEED it
---
I fear no man, but that thing...
---
Then get good
---
All for the arcade idea and treasure hunt. It would be nice if there was some sort of billboard that showed a spot on the whitespring grounds that if you found it, you get the treasure. Just like the regional treasure maps, but instead of an inventory item, make is displayed in game.
---
Once the treasure is found, remove the display. Have it cycle, and do not make it easy by any means.
---
I left shortly after finishing the board checking out the new things and realizing that my atoms are now score ....forever so I thought about ticket but instead uninstalled the game and am going back to YouTube while writing books and helping a friend make our own video game
---
at the quakecon, davs said we will have armors and power armors display yes!
---
Im still curious about a few points. Like you I wonder if mole miners will scale up beyond 40. I’d like the legendary’s from uranium fever to have loot that could be better then what I’m carrying. I’ve gotten to many great weapons that turned out to be worse just because they were level 35 or 40.
---
Yeah, everyone always says "drop a nuke at White springs, it's the best place to nuke." I did, and it was the same as the normal handful of ghouls that are there. I don't think I've EVER seen a legendary in a nuke zone and I have 220 hours.
---
It is kinda like fortnite! Only you can spawn blueprints so you don't have to be on fucking cocain to keep up with the kids building Insta mansions  these days lmao
---
Most of those are atom shop items
---
That Communist armor looks insane, unfortunately it looks like it will be close to the final reward...
---
Totally agree with this post. They could also add fast travel mats for player camps (like in fallout 4) I have lost track of the amount of times I have spawned inside other players walls  or half way down a cliff etc
---
Could you give them to players ?
---
I always thought it was foreplay to tea bagging so would shoot them.
---
And at the moment (as I'm still patching) I'm running on the assumption the legendaries'll scale.
---
Hopefully once it's loaded I'll luck into Fever and we'll have our answer.
---
No, what platform are you on?
---
Can't wait to unlock 40 more skins for each different set that they all look the same. Yay!
---
PA display, new PA paint, foosball table, shooting gallery game, bunker, new building set...
---
Season 2 looks like a significant step up!
---
Xbox sadly 😔✨
---
&gt; Y'all think that's like an Enclave jetpack or supposed to be more of an alien looking one?
---
Let's not forget that the Enclave had an alien blaster inside the mobile base crawler at Adams Air Force Base. What if it's some reverse engineering and they're one and the same...
---
If u were on PS4 I could give you one of the asylum ones
---
The queen has 70 or 75%flat dmg reduction. So use chems. Gat gun shows more damage because it's a slow fire rate. On the cards I've got my je gatplas up to 400dmg and over 170 a shot to the queen
---
If you can’t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
---
I’d love to know when you get that answer.
---
Do you know anyone that plays Xbox that might give me one?
---
My first mutation was Marsupial and I thought I had Starched Genes selected, but I didn't and lost Marsupial.  Since then I never ever remove Starched Genes, especially now that I have many more mutations.
---
I feel like we'll get slapped for suggesting a vaccine in soda form. That being said I could also see an Intellect (Easier to mass produce utilizing the factory) or Charisma (Easier to get someone to take it) check to explain why we did it.
---
Literally, this battle pass has caused me to play the least amount of fallout 76 than I have since release since I have no reason to play after completing dailies
---
I saw a raider attack dog that was a legendary, I didn't kill him 😔 he was too cute
---
I want to turn mannequins into target dummies.
---
Strange that they used a completely different model from the current in game mannequin models.
---
Would have been fine with just those, does that mean that these can be posed, or some such?
---
Looks like the hands were designed for gripping items. 
---
Cant wait to integrate them into my Silent Hill camp.
---
I just hope that these new internal spaces can be integrated into our existing camps in some way. And not that their in a bulky space that wont snap or sync with anything else.
---
Either way happy to finally see these making their arrival. I just hope they dont cost so much that I have to delete half my house to fit even 1 in.
---
Already miffed that I couldn't make space for my chicken coop.
---
What I would really love now too thinking about it, is an item that hides your face in the same way, so you can hide among mannequins to scare visitors.  XD
---
I had to do a quick google image search to make sure that mannequin wasn't wearing Preston Garvey's outfit. It's close, but not quite the same. I was worried Appalachia would have settlements that needed our attention...
---
This one keeps food from degrading and slower at 50% I dn't know if the other one does that or not.  
---
Regardless it only holds 15 items and IMO, meh.
---
My son is playing Fallout: New Vegas. There are missions he won't do because it involves killing guard dogs.
---
win 10
---
Start farming for junk.  Then one will pop up and as soon as you finish one a next one will pop up the very next second. They are constantly going off when you have other stuff to do lol.
---
PC
---
Nice!
---
The chinese, Green house set, and Brotherhood stuff is definitely mislabeled to throw us off but it still looks like some really cool things.
---
Damn those BoS bunkers are fire
---
FO76 always uses the sound output you select in Windows before you start the game, so make sure it is the correct one: click on the speaker symbol in your taskbar if it is Win10, if you have multiple options there will be a \^ symbol that opens a dropdown menu. 
---
Another (quite old) sound bug involved switching voice chat from area to team or the other way to get sound at all, but that was fixed long ago if I remember right.
---
I guess you already checked if all volume sliders in the audio setting menu are set to max.
---
Find a private server friend. Was gonna offer if we had compatibility.
---
tried both didnt help in my case
---
Man, back in December 18 nuking WS was intense. Glowing Ones gave like 4x more exp and you could go from like level 50-70 in a few hours, the ghouls were like 1/4 legendary. This was before murmurgh and people would just litter the floor with legendaries. And every time somebody simply left and rejoined off their party they would *all* respawn. Good times...
---
I don't think I've seen a single person *praising* the grinding, craving more. I've seen plenty of people quitting the game over the legendary run, but never any players that bought the game because of it. I understand the concept of minority, but zero?
---
it also baffles me, the idea that anyone would play Fo76 over countless other more competent mmos. it's the same with NW, nobody goes 'oh boy, I want to play a BR. which should I pick, Fortnite, PUBG or Fo76's NW?"
---
whatever. you say that grinding is good. this sub and Bethesda's forums say otherwise. countless people quit over the legendary run and the backlash on release was in part due to the mmo-esque nature of the game (remember the limited stash space debacle, hm?). you can hold onto the delusion that it's just a 'vocal minority' but evidence points otherwise. **they're even *increasing* the number of perk coins you get, not decreasing them**. but I'm clearly not going to convince someone so emotionally invested in a game, in Fo76 of all games.
---
&gt;Second, they aren't using mobile tactics. They aren't putting up paywalls to progress. They don't time out the amount of levels you can gain. They don't push ads in your face to buy atoms for boosts.
---
they literally do all of those things. the legendary run is the way it is because they know a lot of players would rather just pay up front instead of being inconvenienced daily, not because busywork = content. otherwise the option to buy levels wouldn't be there in the first place.
---
the dailies are also the very definition of time gating. it's in their \*ing name. on top of gold bullion, scrip, caps. and let's not forget the ad that pops up for new players, telling them to go buy an icon in the atom shop. or the cut atom shop cutouts in train stations.
---
HOLY FUCK I WANT THAT BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL BUNKER 
---
It's ripped STRAIGHT from the OG fallout 1 and 2 games
---
That actually screams passion and care to me, now I'm actually hype as fuck for BOS content and I may have to defect from my beloved responders  lmao
---
Why the hell did they just completely remove this? I feel like nuking literally had no purpose...
---
It was top NE, in that gated in area with two ticks. NE of any markers.
---
I read that Bethesda said that you should be able to level up on SCORE just playing the game. So I'm here to tell you that I have completely ignored the challenge screens and have just been playing the game, doing quests, events, looting, crafting, etc .. and I've almost completed the entire first half of the legendary run in about three week's time. Not such a grind. Oh, and I haven't played every day.
---
Yea, now I can finally build a game room! This is awesome!
---
I am and I value my time more than wasting it in starting at level 1 again.  
---
I can learn just as much at level 50 from a new build.  
---
For this you would start off with a small amount of caps and it would be more difficult to gear yourself with legendaries after starting this new one. So what if you could? We are the players/customers.  
---
I've found a melee character SUCKS sweaty Satan's balls and anal seepage until level 30.
---
It's a post-apocalyptic jet pack...sounds like it's working just fine.
---
Your local supermarket.
---
Wait really? I didn't notice vehicles :O
---
I'm not sure, the "Armor Ace" theme looks like it's trying to imitate a GI Joe show, with communists as the villains. And besides, this season had a bunch of off-theme rewards too so that in itself doesn't indicate anything.
---
I'm not one with all the math skills to evaluate every food item, it's degrading time, and perks vs backpack mod vs a fridge.
---
Never had this issue.   Most fights have an average of 4 tents and I've yet to see it prevent a landing.
---
I hope murder isn’t one of his hobbies
---
Sounds like real life to me. Some people break their ankle 1 inch off the floor.
---
That would be nice, but I expect a new currency, again.
---
I played for a couple months a long time ago was slow to understand that they were dailies, and I'd just hop over to do the quest because it seemed important. I remember thinking to myself "This game feels like chores every time I get on" and just kinda lost interest in playing soon after that. Never hated the game like the rest of the internet... just lost interest.
---
If there was an auction house or trading hub, that would make White Springs worth visiting.
---
Goat Legs Perk. Had to reenable it.😂
---
Yeah I was actually just thinking I really wanted some red colored combat or scout armor, and now here's a possibility to earn them without atoms 
---
Pretty good deal for me
---
This is why a jet pack only belongs on power armor. Normal armor has much more useful mods for the torso anyway.
---
So all of you have done it to completion?
---
Seasons just need to be removed all together. I logged in for the first few days it came out, didn't get the correct points for the challenges I was doing, went on Reddit and saw the math of what it would take to get rank 100 and quit.
---
I love this game, but at the same time, I can't help but feel like I have no freedom when I log in anymore. The game is a *job.* I miss being able to choose what daily and weekly challenges I complete, without having to worry about missing out. The individuality is not there anymore. My entire group of friends has quit since *the legendary run* came out...I will miss 76 and the memories I have shared on it.
---
Hot Damn, the SEASON stuff looks awesome!
---
Is that Gnarly Spiked-Lamp looking thing a Super Sledge skin?
---
Looks like a possible display as a season reward too
---
So much sorry
---
Yeah. Never played Fortnite, mostly because I'm not really into the Battle Royale genre (but for whatever reason I really like NW, when it's probably the "worst" Battle Royale out there), but also because the building and how core it is. I get headaches by only watching it on Youtube lol
---
At least here isn't that important.
---
It may not have originated from the family, but I'd imagine it would be adopted
---
This has happened to me a few times too.
---
Maybe this is how they fix the game
---
Yeah I take it back, the red star paints for the armors are the new gillie paints. Not bad.
---
Vault 51 deserves its own DLC because we've already been told to "Kill ZAX."
---
A building team just gives +1 INT per teammate, including yourself. Each INT points boosts XP gain by about 2%. Don’t worry too much about the name; people in public teams can’t build in your camp. These teams are used for solo play with group benefits.
---
I can't bring myself to do it. They're so Innocent
---
Me too
---
Noone said cheat.
---
And the helmet looks fit for a Rottweiler
---
Is the Musk Ape the same as Skunk Ape? Shorter and smelly than sasquatch.
---
Everyone just hates that section of the map, it’s really annoying
---
If you spawn by Morgantown train yard, go behind it and then head north then go north of the airport. They spawn in large distances between each other.
---
Been like that for me for about a week or so.
---
You can place all the survival rewards from NW
---
Platform?
---
Now if only we could build the walls to make our own quonset buildings. If they did I could combine it with the Ranger Watchtower which hasn't been released yet, and the barb-wire fencing. Hell, if the Instanced interiors allow us to make some elaborate interiors (hammer space), especially when against a cliff side, i'd likely have the tower and fencing as a guard post for the perimeter, then have the quonset/barracks against the cliff face. The instanced interior could give the illusion of it being built as a tunnel into the mountain. Inside I could make it look like an old ammo depot that's been converted into my workshop, store, and personal bunker.
---
I will admit I have found some quirky behavior with the SS Jet pack.   But what I hate is when I rubber band back and don't get my AP back and then I crash.  That goes for the Power Armor Jet Pack as well :-/
---
I'm barely 3 level ahead of the time line.  Definitely been a grind especially the Daily LVL up for a measly 250 score points is way to much effort for 25% of a score level.  If you level you character up you should as least get to level up the equivalent of one score lvl of XP
---
Vault 94 raid V.2? Wonder if it'll go down the same as that update.
---
I'd prefer chicken eggs to frog eggs for cooking. Even more so if we could make bread, which was listed as craftable according to one of the old weekly challenges. We got flour after all.
---
Unfortunately, I have tried all that already...
---
But thanks anyway
---
&gt; It's a nice relaxing game to just farm up materials, and legendary items. It's not for everyone, I feel this is a game you either love, or hate, there's no in between.
---
Pretty much. It's odd, I sometimes spend like 20-25 minutes just preparing and crafting things before going out. Even so I have some kind of weird fun even doing that.
---
It wasn't released as a replacement for new gameplay content, it was intended to be released alongside new content 
---
They just had delays :/
---
Hopefully after the release of the new boss event, the Brotherhood of steel new content and questline stays on schedule
---
I need help too il pay u a good amount of caps
---
Oh sorry :o Im on PC :P.
---
Or Swamp Ape? Something like that. I know there is a Bigfoot for the swamps. I'm not 100% on the name.
---
At some point people will simply burn out and not care enough to do them anymore, might take a bit more time into season 2 but I bet less people will complete it this time (or resort to xp cheats to grind instead if any are found).
---
have you tried making a new character and using a bench?
---
Prime you weapons you'll have to launch some nukes then.
---
No. You go up one level and also to the same amount of XP. You do lose a bit of progress b/c each level goes up 25 points I think. IMO, shoot for the rewards you really want and try to use less Atoms to get there.
---
If I'm gonna spend the 25-40 caps to claim a workshop, I'm going to get resources. I'm not gonna waste 250+ caps and spend an hour server hopping.
---
Also, it still doesn't solve the problem of people PVPing when you try to claim a workshop.
---
is that a fixer skin?
---
I think we can all concede to the fact that the SS helmet looks dope as hell tho
---
You can head to the whitespring resort. They have a few clothing shops and you can get the red sequin dress there.
---
I literally shouted "Dang it" because I was hoping the rewards for Season 2 would such. I wanted a big break, but I love making greenhouse style camps. All my settlements in FO4 were so pretty and fragile.
---
Yes, it's the Enclave PA skin jetpack.
---
I check Cranberry glade and its where I found a deathclaw last week that I have now. Otherwise I put my survival tent at the unmarked vertibird crash in the north east of the map [here](https://imgur.com/a/0zhnpcy) and server hop between the two. Usually takes a couple of hours to find anything but I always eventually succeed there.
---
That would be neat,  now if it only had better range or no fuel consumption, yes I am looking at you SS Jet pack.
---
Sorry for the all caps rage but BETHESDA TRAPPER ARMOR FUCKING EXISTS WHAT THE FUCK
---
We must be in the same demographic of people that don't like battle royales but like NW for some reason haha
---
I want to like the game mode  in other games, because my friends do, but I get so annoyed by other ones
---
Pubg is sooooo slowwww, like 30 minutes of walking to randomly get headshot from nowhere
---
Apex is too sweaty and try hardy, plus I really preferred titanfall 2's miltiplayer so I'm salty that Apex has hurt chances of a titanfall 3 from happening 
---
I actually like playing fortnite with my wife every once in a while, but I know ill never be good at it because there's so much of a skill curve 
---
NW is just a comfy Battle royale, i dunno man haha
---
Ow boy my camp is just going to be a full legion of those puppies.
---
LOL!   
---
excellent
---
I'll give it a try! Is it a fix or is it just to test to see if it happens without anything in the inventory?
---
Nowadays I just go there into the ball room alone, playing piano on the mic hoping for the tiniest chance someone will come and chill.
---
Everyone talks about this fast travel bug but I play 4 hours a day and have yet to have any issues fast traveling.
---
Tank Killer: Pistols now benefit from the Tank Killer Perk Card. 
---
OMG PISTOLS MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT VIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111111111111111111111
---
I have the red dress already :(
---
GLASS WALLS MOTHERFUCKERS!!
---
3 rounds?  Damn - wish I had that kind of luck today.  I have been at it 2 hours straight now, making top 20 every time and have seen 7 creatures so far.  1 of which killed me (assaultron), 4 of which I killed, 1 Grafton Monster someone else killed and 1 my team mate killed (because of course kills don't register team wide if you all do damage, only the killing blow...)  
---
They need to make this just a single creature, as the RNG on finding creatures in the first place is high, then getting the killing blow on top of that :/
---
I fly
---
I had this happen too me once. Hasnt happened since though
---
I was looking at all the released skins and it doesn't quite look like any of them?
---
I assume it's going to be a new design to accompany the Jetpack's release.
---
Given the style of the Jetpack, I almost wonder if it's a Zetan themed PA?
---
He's being down voted because he doesn't make any sense, every NW game i ever been has a team that it puts you in even when you go in solo, if there ever was a chance it could all be solo then it will never happen due to the way the system is designed.
---
...So what happened to the idea that daily ops were going to be taking place in areas outside appalachia?
---
Give each player on the server a Vendor Bot and have them stationed in the big open area on the second floor. Turn it into a player market. That would turn it back into a hub of players.
---
Bethesda could sell vendor bot skins, win for everyone.
---
Yep - this is why I'd like to see it changed.  Pacify an animal? Change to learn the camp item!
---
eesh...I still have over 20 levels to go.
---
Ok thanks. That’s the old one and unfortunately outside of aesthetics it’s not as good as Good With Salt.
---
Like realy how hard can it be to fix it? Will it get fixed even in this month... its already been 9 days. It blocks any progress in the game had to do the brotherhood quest at lvl 21(with a lvl 50 power armor set as a reward gj)because i cant do any other quest because two of the 3 main questlines are block by such a stupid little bug... I love the fallout  games and really respect their work but this is a big letdown.
---
Bet your chicken lasted longer than my level 40 diseased megasloth
---
Went there today and not a single legendary spawned
---
Exactly. Sometimes if its close to the end of a match ill spectate till the end and every time ive done this is always a team that has won. Ive wondered what if there where no teams. Last Man Standing.
---
Your wishes have been answered. like omg. check the latest pts datamine.
---
Auction house wow style
---
I don’t understand what you mean unless you’re unaware of the ability to run without a team. There is physically no way for you to see whether other players are running solo or in a team. Choosing solo doesn’t match you against other solo players, it throws you in randomly. He is saying if literally every player who ever played it selected solo, then by default everyone would be on their own, because there wouldn’t be a single team to fight against
---
I'll probably have one Frankenstein with 5 different paint jobs and that Father Winter helmet. Finally, that thing will have a purpose other than taking up 10 pounds of storage space.
---
Warcraft uses a 20 min buffer where gates are locked for the first 2 minutes. When they opens, everyone should be loaded. They could make some sort of paralysis where you can't move until 60 seconds has passed or something
---
NO WAY!!!
---
Where can I see that?!
---
I believe on one of the QuakeCon discussion presentations they mentioned any DLC that would leave the general play area is still a ways off.  I would have to rematch the Youtube video.
---
Can't be changed, only solution would be to create a new account with the correct region *and* pay PS Plus for that new account to be able to play online.
---
I see red star items for my red star character.

---
look at the ATX link
---
Hahahahahaha
---
NO SHORTCUTS BOY
---
I'm thinking game HOUSE!
---
Or just like other games do.  Let the dailies build up to a certain amount.  For example on MtG Arena.  You can stack up 3 days worth of daily quests. After that once you clear a days the next day you can get more.
---
Amazing, I think I love the next season even more
---
And miss out on a chance to get a 1-star Nocturnal Pipe Wrench from the SBQ?!
---
im hyped for the displays
---
Those mannequins are just asset ports from the fo4 wasteland workshop DLC iirc, you can’t pose them but you can put any outfit on them, but they can’t hold items.
---
Just do it
---
There isn’t vehicles?
---
I hope that’s the case. I’ll be a bit mad if I have to completely respec to a melee build lmao
---
What level are you and how much work have you put into your build?
---
What's the difference with the in game ones tho?
---
I wonder why they didn't just add the in game ones.
---
The merge glitch would probably work. Final render did a video on youtube not too long ago on it
---
Vault 51 in adventure mode hopefully???
---
My boyfriend has perfected a goomba yeet with his jetpack that doesn't kill him, much less damage his limbs. Borderline terrifying, tbh.
---
Well, quick google search brought up this fix for someone with a similar problem: open the win10 sound control panel, open device properties -&gt; additional device properties, advanced and change the standard format. For me it is 24Bit, 48000Hz (studio quality), but for this 2 guys it was something [different](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gj82u4/no_sound_ingame_pc_steam/)
---
nerfed or one wasteland'd
---
These actually look cool though, I don’t mind
---
Looks like the guy who posted about hammocks in 76 is gonna get his wish in the form of a Atom shop item.
---
There are two other spots around that lake in a 30 second walk. Totalling 3 all with in a minute hike. By far my favorite spot.
---
I got bad memories after seeing the outfit lol
---
I didn't see it in the PTS notes. what damage are you seeing in the pipboy? assuming that's a non explosive bloodied handmade with the powerful auto receiver.
---
Plant tatoes, soldier.
---
Didn’t somebody post a thread suggesting that Tank Killer should include pistols this week? What are the odds!?
---
The in game ones don’t have the code to wear different outfits, these were made in fo4 to specifically wear every outfit you put on them. Much easier than writing new code for static ones
---
Oooo! Maybe I should reload my pts to have a look at all of this
---
For somebody who doesn't know how much damage this Bloodied should be doing, can you enlighten me?
---
Oh shit oh fuck
---
Did anyone have a problem with their daily challenges today automatically completed and no score awarded
---
This happens to me when I'm on the wrong perk card load out.
---
No it can't but the ultracite could have the mod on any of the parts before they patched it. So my ultracite leg has one. (Still shows on the torso. The other leg is x01 with calibrated shocks. 2 x01 arms and esc torso for the 4x mining  yield
---
Lol yeah I read that in her voice.
---
Has it been nerfed or is that because of lvl scaling due to one Appalachia ?
---
What exactly was changed. Is it from the way bonuses are calculated bc if so thats not a bloodied nerf so much as an everything nerf. Also has bloodied melee been tested? I still think bloodied commando should not kill as quick as bloodied melee anyway. Theres less risk involved.
---
People won’t like that... how nerfed I can’t tell
---
Weird. Was not expecting downvotes but whatever. Bloodied is very popular. It just is?
---
Wait a minute. 
---
Is that a ATX item for an ATX item? (Referring to the camo Screaming Eagle skin)
---
Damn shame
---
I’d like to complain about your comment
---
what pisses me off is I can't make 2mm electromagnetic rounds with the armco machine or ammo factory. I can make everything else, but not that? WHY?
---
just a test. if it works you know it must be something to do with your character
---
 Bonus Damage: We’ve made adjustments to the way damage bonuses are calculated to make the resulting damage from multiple buffs more predictable and allow future improvements.           
---
This may result in some changes in damage output for some combinations of buffs.
---
Jesus, that's NERFED?
---
Nerfed by about half
---
RNGesus was not blessing you
---
I didn't realize that they made you pay atoms after a few levels.
---
I didn't realize they made you pay cash to gain more legendary equipment after a daily cap.
---
I have yet to see an ad pushing me to buy atoms or fallout first.
---
I don't think you know how insanely bad mobile tactics are.
---
And yet again, your guesstimates are just that. Guesses.
---
I denounce your "majority" of players claim here and now. As it stands, a small portion of the gamers post in the forums or subs. And among those, some, not all, claim they don't like grinding.
---
It's a commonly known fact that only a small portion of people who play the game post. Playercount says there are over 30k people playing 76. This sub has only 5k currently logged in. Since when is 5k a majority of 30k?
---
god why are you guys still playing this buggy mess of a game, it’s been three years just give up
---
You alcoholic
---
I didn't mind the ghillie skins neither (except all the bugs they had lol), but unlocking 15 different ghillie skins or related stuff I think it was a bit too much. Specially if you think that from 100 rewards only 47 were cosmetics.
---
Or when I assist the raider thief in killing a bunch of blood gangs, and then turn and kill him while the other raiders just stand by
---
I am on ps4 what's your add ?
---
I think they come to Appalachia to investigate taggertys disappearance, not because some Wastelanders found shiny metal
---
I hear Bigfoot stories from all over America. Idk what yall talking about
---
It’ll be fixed next Tuesday they said.
---
they need to nerf it even more then
---
K
---
Idk what you're talking about. Ive heard stories from every part of us.
---
Why are you here and also browsing new lmao
---
Random often includes streaks of similar results.
---
I got a jetpack built I'm working on because my jetpack is all sorts of fucked, like I can hit the stratosphere depending on the lag. I've learned two things: if you're currently using it when you hit the ground it negates fall damage, and goat legs combined with any other fall damage armor = space man strats
---
I'll be on later to do today's daily challenges, I'm AJSpecifically.
---
assuming that's a bloodied, non explosive handmade with the powerful automatic receiver and you have all 3 level 3 rifleman perks, bloody mess, nerd rage, adrenal reaction and 19% health, what damage are you seeing in the pipboy?
---
285?
---
Das me, the space man
---
YES. Mine often brought useful stuff, but had to be removed as their repetitive sound bytes were driving me insane. 
---
Plus, it’ll be a useful tool to tell which owners of the fasnacht collectron are just innocent victims and which are gleeful deviants.
---
I needed a workbench nearby the other day and went to the “mall”....immediately realized I hadn’t been there in MONTHS!
---
dude this is sick, but they need to increase camp budget. i mean, what’s the point of all this if i can’t even place them down
---
Mmmmm...steak
---
I mean it can happen...30% isn’t very much my dude. 10-15 times isn’t really much anyways, I craft ammo at the hundreds and I probably only hit like 45 times.
---
Good point I forgot about the fire rate guess it would add up.
---
The salty tears must flow...

Also. Screw you, I get the Bigfoot Newsletter in the mail and have do for the last 7 years.
---
That's why I thought an unmarked random encounter would be cool.
---
I’ve never found an alone megasloth in my 5 hours of server hopping :/
---
SS jetpack physics is all kinds of crazy.  Walking down a normal road and jump and go up 20 feet.  In the middle of Hold The Line event, jump and find yourself entering the upper atmosphere.  Small visual quirky bugs are fine (sometimes even funny), but these insane in the middle of battle bugs are just the worst.
---
That said - still LOVE the jet pack.
---
Moneys to tight for steak
---
Try too
---
Haha. Everything in this game could be explained with an "idk". By farest is the game I've dedicated the most time in the last 2 years, and I still don't know why xD
---
Is it the best looter-shooter out there? Not even close. Survival? I wouldn't even tag 76 as a survival game lol. Battle Royale? Ha. And I still prefer it above any other game that does the same things and 1000 times better.
---
Idk, is a weird feeling. It's definitely a weird game. Or maybe we are the weird ones.
---
Saw a legendary beaver once...oh the laughs.
---
You do you king people who look down on others for buying their way to the top are just poor

I use it to point out my loot bag when giving gifts.

There’s actually some real good dialogue choices when role playing as a vault tec shill. Most of them when talking to the overseer.
---
Just power armor horde events....
---
Once I get in myself, I'll test bloodied melee but pretty much everyone who has fully installed and logged in is reporting about 1\\2 as much damage now for their bloodied 
---
Not sure about Junkies
---
Not tryna flex was just wondering because I wanna try using heavy weapons. All this is new to me.
---
Bloody explosive is the best build hands down, junkies close second. Usually explosive bloody heavy guns are the most OP if you are looking to be a beast.
---
Bloody increases damage the lower your health, you can also have unyielding armor that increases your stats the lower your health.
---
So what you do is you have 1 or 2 unyielding pieces with maybe good resistances to radiation as a bonus to shore up your weakness to radiation builds, and have a bunch of defensive legendary armor and serendipity that makes you dodge 45% of all attacks when your health is low.
---
Also nerd rage which boosts dmg and other stuff when health is low.
---
Also adrenol mutation that stacks with bloody effect on your weapon.
---
Also have various healing perks and mutations like healing mutation, then class freak to eliminate most of negative effects from mutations.
---
Then spam stealth boys,nuka cola quantum, stack multiple stim packs(they do stack), and multiple food items, and tea and what have you while your health is below 20% with high radiation, which will synergize radiation perks that increase your stats further like radicool +5 strength.
---
Then you just heal at a insane rate as you take very little damage and sometimes no damage at all through seredipty while having a ton of armor and mutations and perks and items that all combine together to create a god like character that sits at low max health with high radiation.
---
You can only do a max of 250 damage per hit towards other players. So a missile launcher  will have a long bullet travel time and shoot/reload process. Therefore any bloody explosive weapon that's AUTOMATIC can hit multiple times for max damage in a INSTANT where actual explosive weapons can go fuck themselves basically making them USELESS with very slow and heavy attack that only hits once.
---
IF you want to be a overpowerd god with too much synergy for the build, bloody explosive is the way to go. Yes it's broken...and yes players will whine if bethesda ever touches it, perpetually ruining the balance of all future itemization in the process of adding new item effects.
---
Fuck yes I have that piece of shit
---
Also. Calm down bro. Not my fault you dedicate yourself to a mythical creature that hard.
---
Power armor display, an interior camp it looks like, a greenhouse, and that slick looking power armor skin. I'm down for season 2

Thanks for posting. Similar situation here. I look forward to seeing some answers.

Lol clearly your missing the humor. And embarrassed that you don’t know how to read. Which begs the question how do you manage to write?
---
Just why?
---
Yeah, I know it's not the biggest sample size. I'm well aware of the many, many unfair aspects of probability. I would chalk it up to variance but you never know with this game. It could always be a bug. Just wondering if it was a widespread issue.

---
I'd prefer challenging challenges that last of whole season. Similar to other battle passes.
---
What?
---
Me too, brother.
---
So you continue? Just because I misread one thing doesn't mean you can turn around and pretend to be a bigger and better person. I write fine. I mistype sometimes. BTW: *how
---
Not really. Possibly 40 and stop. You stop getting Special points at 50, I believe. After that it’s just perk cards and a very slow and inefficient respec process.
---
Did the chicken coop just come out?
---
Weekly achievements are more engaging too. I never bothered with dailies *on purpose* before the season, but I would often hunt the weekly challenges. 
---
I don’t know how many players who aren’t those of us engaging on reddit like daily challenges.  I’d probably end up enjoying the game more overall if I could go take a break with one or two other games without feeling like 76 was my job I needed to go get ready for.
---
Ok, I’m digging that annoyed commie icon

The way people complain about delays I doubt it.

Why not just do both though?

Talkin bout the legendary run
---
I have been playing for about 14 months.  I can say I have had about 3 conversations in that time.  One was a guy yelling at me for my camp location (Before I knew it was messing up the spawn of a rare vendor), one was a kid asking for help and another was an older gentleman who just seemed to be narrating the Line in the Sand even.
---
Most people just don't talk on PC.
---
Besides the ammo converter whis is nice but needs some work from Bethesda the other items are cosmetic. Only items Worth are fireworks due to the reload bug and maybe lunchboxes. All of the above are quite low in the race so you could easily get them. Nothing worth paying imho. :)
---
Apparently your prayers have been answered.  There’s a atx hammock datamine for next patch!  Not sure how to link on mobile just search this sub for atx
---
Do us a solid and ask for some mistress of mystery stuff!
---
I use it to get on buildings and rain hell
---
Is it me or am I the only one getting GI joe vibes especially from the Chinese commander outfit I’m assuming it’s called the one with the metal face mask gives me cobra commander vibes.  Might actually have to put effort in with this one ffs
---
They changed some of the math for bonus damages which should in theory affect all weapons but of our group, about 12 people have successfully downloaded and installed the PTS and all report their bloodied weapons are doing about 1\\2 as much damage now
---
Looks like a lot of good stuff in the season. The paints are okay, mostly looking forward to that BoS bunker and the commie shooting arcade game. The PA displays look cool, seems like there will be a PA display case from the season but a PA mannequin from the atom shop? Along with the regular armor ones too. And some new weapon displays, honestly pretty excited about this
---
Gotcha
---
Whoever the artist was really outdid themselves, the new model looks fantastic
---
Don’t take workshops and never worry about the pvp
---
I was able to grind it out.  I dont personally feel like the rewards are worth spending atoms on, but if you do then go get em.  You buying your levels has zero impact on me or anyone else.
---
I did this pretty much all but 10 levels this season as I wanted some of the higher rewards but didn’t think I could dedicate the time to grind them out.
---
If I remember correctly, it was 150 atoms a level, so 15k atoms from start to finish.
---
So match that to what Beth offers dollars (or whatever your currency) to atoms and you’ll have an idea of cost.
---
Hi Hades!
---
Thanks for the invite! I really appreciate it. We still play mostly by ourselves but will definitely hop on to the public server from time to time now to sell things and join the tougher events, so I'll have to look into joining you (discord is completely unfamiliar to me). Thank you again!
---
I vote upgrading workshops. They're worth nothing right now. Barely useful getting fusion cores. 
---
If they made some kinda pvp related reward to a workshop area they'd invite more people to pvp. 
---
I'd argue we should disable legendary effects on guns &amp; armor inside these zones for "fair" pvp. Your perks count though so your build still actually matters. Force a delay on quamtum spamming and stims in PA. Just some base stuff to make the fight more fair between teams. There needs to be a huge reward to make the fight worth it though. Just a PVP area with junk and caps is useless.
---
Anything using a legendary module may proc super duper and make the sound but it won’t actually dupe the item. The proc sound and notice is a bug.
---
I don’t think the Leadbelly version is still copyrighted. He died over 70 years ago and i think a copyright expires 70 years after the owner dies. But I’m not sure I’m not a lawyer.
---
Yea i dont imagine i have much time left
---
Any word on how junkies is looking?
---
That depends 100% on which episodes of the X-Files.
---
I don't see how it's possible.
---
You are put in a team when you play the game even if you don't play together or see each other there is always a team on the left bottom no matter what.
---
The OP means a complete free for all where everyone doesn't have a team on the left bottom during gameplay. All 52 player free for all, where as NOW you are always put inside a 4 man team even if you don't play together.

---
Shouting “Yeah!” every time it shoots a sonic blast.
---
they don't do it directly, in your face. they place limitations everywhere so you feel compelled to pay, just so you can remove the annoyances. the icon example illustrates this perfectly, anyone would rather pay 50 cents so they don't have Todd shoving an ad on their face whenever they open up the map.
---
it's a classic mobile scheme. sure it's not as bad as Korean gachas, but it doesn't make it any less disingenuous. this is all pretty basic so I'm hoping you're just pretending to be naive for the sake of winning internet points, and don't actually condone such bs. oh well.
---
&gt;And yet again, your guesstimates are just that. Guesses.
---
and yours is what, exactly?
---
I mean, even if I were to concede. mine is still an educated guess based on the response from a sizeable sample of the playerbase. this sub, the official forums, youtube.
---
but what evidence do you have, exactly, to back the idea that people actually want to grind? because you have none of what I just listed to back my guess. there's no evidence, anywhere, that a considerable amount of players enjoy grinding. I mean, assuming you're right, and these people are a minority, even pvpers make themselves heard. but I've *never* seen anyone asking for more daily inconveniences, I mean chores, I mean challenges.
---
a minority is not zero.
---
Lighten up DildoBuggerit
---
Someone want to translate this for me
---
That would satisfy daily login pushes, and would seem more like a perk to be done faster than a requirement.
---
The two games now beg for the addition of other games and the really nice arcade cabinets from creation club.  One can only hope!
---
Jokes my guy
---
You will unlikely reach 100, but just play and see how far you make it as a test. My goal is 78 as I want the chicken coop, outside of that I am curious to see how far I get, I don't bother with level ups and do most of my dailies and weeklies .. I am track to get to 78, so I think I will be ok .. I don't really play outside of my dailies.
---
I was just thinking the same thing.  Must be a good day to be that guy.
---
I mean it depends on what you want, there are some neat things for your C.A.M.P, the free Atoms, Skins etc. But if you do not care then don't bother, but no reason not to do your daily and weekly challenges.
---
Because of this i never use energy guns
---
Thats completely fine, i just wanted to, you know, give you an invite so you can create more of those stories yourself. I personally joined that discord like 3 weeks ago and had a blast until now, people there are friendly and really help me out (though, out of my own personal experience, i can say that about PC only, but i assume its the same on the other 2 platforms). Hope you will enjoy exploring this new world, vault dweller :)
---
Do you find your Tesla eventually stops doing damage? Allegedly it only affects the automatic barrel but I've had it on the standard barrel too.  Eventually enemies will take hits but just regen back to full no matter how many times you fire, needing a relog to fix.
---
IIRC the camp leaders does show up, but is buggy as hell. Didn't show up for me until I refreshed the cache on my Xbox.
---
Not to mention it took me quite a while to realise the Tadpole badge tasks are under the World section of the Challenges page.
---
&gt; You're pretty much at the point where you'll max out the system.
---
No, I'm not. Not even close. 
---
&gt;So your argument is completely nonsensical. Good job completely undermining your own argument.
---
In case you haven't noticed, Legendary Perks aren't out yet and had  nothing to do with why I decided to spend so many hours on this game.
---
&gt;Thanks for the support.
---
You're delusional.
---
250+ caps and an hour of server hoping?  What the fuck are you even talking about?  The hardest workshop challenge is for five workshops, you get 20 caps for clearing out the enemies and an empty workshop only costs 25 caps costing you a MASSIVE 25 caps for completing the entire challenge.  If any of that takes you an hour then you're doing something horribly wrong.
---
Know the last time I got pvp'd while claiming a workshop?  Never.  You're complaining a bout a problem that fort he vast majority of players isn't even an issue.
---
Yea, that’s the team fill option at the menu. You turn that off. Then the game doesn’t put you in a team. When you’re on the main menu and selecting which game mode, Adventure, Private, and NW, look at the screen on NW after selecting it. There will be a button prompt to turn team fill off and play solo. This is what he’s referring to
---
I think this guy is suffering from a case of Radworms, he is making no sense.
---
I finally change to bloodied two weeks ago after all this years playing
---
F in the chat for me boys
---
Same here when ever I find a serum at decent prices I buy it, can always sell them later if I don’t need them
---
Oh no. My poor camp budget...
---
Edit: oh sheet. Greenhouses. Armour and power armour displays. New bunker type building. New weapon displays. Wtf?? This is great!!
---
Is it maybe the X-02 power armor skin that was found in the ATX datamines back when Wastelanders came out? At that point people only found the model, but not any Atom Shop thumbnails, so maybe they're getting close to releasing it and this is a matching jetpack skin for it
---
Wait, are those mannequins for sale?
---
wow. time to quit the game.
---
I have the exact same gun and it lists 285 with all the perks I mentioned.
---
That’s not very fascist of you, Sir.
---
Cool, thank you so much! Once I figure out what discord is &amp; how it works we'll probably check it out! Glad to hear you've had great experiences with it. Happy gaming!
---
The rewards are all lame, why would you ? I laugh when I see people paying for their level ups and then claiming they have done it .. it's hilarious .. like someone where paid $150 just so he can have the secret door at level 99 and then trying to say he had no regrets, I mean who pays $150 for a secret door, hilarious at best ..
---
if the rewards were cool and they not, it would be worth it, but there isn't a single cool item. I mean the atoms are ok, the rest don't do much for me .. I don't think I have used a single item. Only item I am mildly interested in is the chicken coop, none of the rest excite me at all.
---
playing solo, dont really have any friends who are interested in fallout
---
I'd prefer a little bit from column A and B here personally speaking.
---
Budget goes brrrr
---
Who doesn’t love a good.....how you say.....uh, scam...fest, shit...bank?
---
Did I say that right?
---
Had the same question on my mind. Only rank fifty-one myself, but I assume it's now too late to try and go for rank hundred.
---
If you buy the levels no one's gonna care, if anything you're supporting the game. After the ammo converter nothing is really new. Just reskins of stuff.  
---
Idk if you've seen the new season 2 rewards that was data mined a few posts ago but it might be better for you to just see and look at that stuff first.
---
Yeah I'm aware of that. This was flux and ammo.
---
maybe I’m an idiot, but I think that a game that’s fun to play, gets played more often.  There was a similar legendary loot pool mechanism in destiny and destiny two, without rolling pins
---
I've gotten to the point where I really prefer games that give unique experiences more than anything else haha, even if that experience is flawed
---
I also love games with base building and fashion lmao and my lord this game excels at that
---
If there is another multiplayer game with this amount of ways to build and decorate both yourself and your base, I wanna know about it lmao 
---
If you wanna play another game that gives me the "this game is weird good" vibes, I reccomend Kenshi
---
Kenshi is one of my favorite games ever, I play that for my singleplayer fix and Fallout 76 when I want to play online usually haha
---
Be friendly on a public server, look for someone who looks like they are grabbing everything ( good chance they have fo1st) go to privateb finish quest. Best i got for you, sorry to say.
---
Ask someone nicely to craft one for you if you give them the materials 🙂. I didn't have Shielded Raider leathers I wanted, so I posted on here and offered caps and materials for the service, they refused the caps and were glad to help me out.
---
Or smart and the people buying their way are idiots .. come on the rewards are not worth paying real money, give me a break .. I can see if we get to the end of the season and people are out of time, go for it, but to buy levels this early on, it's silly.
---
Noo, I'm hoping it's not actually that bad, but it seems from the notes they didn't learn anything from why the vault raids failed so badly in the first place. They're locking things behind timers again...they better not have you waiting through a dozen doors and terminals that can fail your challenge if the server isn't feeling particularly responsive. Also, "Resilient: Enemies can only be killed by a melee attack"...so literally reintroducing the infamous damage bug, except this time as a feature.
---
At least the season rewards look pretty good
---
That encounter seems much more uncommon than just about everything else that shares the same spawn with it. Then on top of that you have to hope you get the right trick or treater and that it has the plan you're after. I had the witch spawn with both plans before, but there's also the vampire who has no plans at all. My go to spot for this one was always by the Miners Monument by Whitespring.
---
I tried to get the skeleton costume plans for so long I eventually just gave up and found someone selling them on discord. 500 caps well spent.
---
You win Tybber42. You've insulted me like that and I have nothing left to say. You've REKT me. LOL.
---
Haha were you camped at charleston station?
---
Unless he just spent all his atoms before he saw this lmao
---
Wat does the chicken coop do?
---
How many do we have to kill today, I don't think most of us will bother who don't usually play NW
---
I don’t think it’s been nerfed since it’s not in the notes but I think the new leveling of enemies will impact all builds
---
I think you did say it right,I’m not the type of person for that kinda thing...
---
But man do I love pissing upstream.
---
Way better then spitting into the wind.
---
Edit:oooop,I meant streem...I accidentally spelt it correctly,my bad yo
---
I remember when I was a low level, I'd go to the burning mine as a little challenge dungeon. That was before whitesprings was even established as the grinding hotspot. I liked just going in there for a chance at a legendary ghoul or wendigo though
---
Must. Grind. Score. 
---
Must. Spread. Propaganda.
---
Are you sure you go them all, including all three tapes from each silo?
---
Oh I think the skins are dope but why not make it where when you unlock it for one armor you unlock it for all and have other stuff on the board
---
I don't mind, I grinded so hard for this season that the burnout went full circle and now I'm having fun again lol
---
Yep! Got to get my chores done before noon! 
---
Before I would log in and do whenever I felt like losing myself for hours now I have a daily dead line and its a relief when it's complete and I just want to play another game.
---
It didn't crash when I used the new character, so it must be something with my main character. It seems like with my main character, if it doesn't crash immediately when using the workstation and I don't scroll through the weapons too fast, it doesn't crash sometimes. But that's a horrible workaround, because it still crashes randomly sometimes even when I do that.
---
Now that legendary agility is going to be a thing, pistols also won't be bottlenecked by all the stealth and pistol damage perks being under agility!
---
Naw I’m going block you now.
---
Yeah well you should’ve done this before wastelanders. You could never finish quest no matter what. But when it came out I finally could. Just make sure you have all of them and once you see her you give her all of them
---
It's been a recurring suggestion since before Wastelanders. Not sure it's enough to bring pistols to the same level as rifles but it's a good step forward.
---
Holy shit they really stepped up their game
---
It’s pure RNG unfortunately. Flat 5% drop chance from Queen of the Hunt. If you’re on PS4 I can help you out with the actual Shielded Underarmor.
---
You left out "Pissing up streem" and it's quite important, it seems.
---
Yep, all 18
---
Has chickens and gives you fertilizer .. kind of like our pet brahmins ..
---
No, there's just no sneak attack bonus on it by the look of it.
---
I did the board on two accounts.  The first one I used the atoms gained during the run to buy the last 12 levels.  On the second, I bought the last 25 using a combination of atoms gained and one 20 buck pack. $20 well spent because I was beat from grinding.
---
You're thinking of Expeditions, which are on the Winter portion of the roadmap.
---
I almost always complete the dailies by just playing. Every now and then I get one I have to set out to accomplish but not often. For me it's usually anything to do with building, I made my camp 2 years ago and have only moved twice and added to it zero times, unless I had to to do a daily.
---
You keep calling the challenges a chore. I mean, if you view them as chores, then that's not my problem. I logged in a few times over a few days and just played the game, and managed to get all daily and weekly challenges, or at least a majority of them, done without even trying.
---
It takes literally no effort as most of the challenges are done while not ally playing. Perhaps the building ones aren't, but gaining a level, claiming workshops, scrapping things, buying and selling stuff, doing events, killing legendary monsters, all things that are completed by simply playing the game.
---
If you can't complete challenges that are completed by simply playing the game, then you aren't playing the game.
---
And again, https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/ shows there are over 30k players online.
---
This sub shows there are only 5k logged in.
---
Who the hell considers 5k a majority of 30k?
---
I don't have an answer to that lol
---
Still looking forward to being a redboi tho lol
---
I really, really hope they just did the same thing as the ghost people in fallout new vegas, and accidentally set their perception to 0 which actually makes it 255
---
As a new player it’s a relief as well. The community is great to help out when I show up to an “easy” public event for like level 25 and all the enemies are 62 for me because a high level person is there. It’s the opposite issue for most people here but it does suck regardless. With that said, I do like the extra xp I get but I rather be productive then finding a place to hide while the others do the fighting haha
---
I remember the days when the dailies were something insane like "Get a picture with a Mirelurk Queen, King and Hatchlings in one shot during a radstorm" so meh I'm fine with where they are now. 
---
I think the problem is that it feels like missing dailies is pretty unforgiving with the legendary run, where it's impossible to complete if you miss a few days.  In their math on giving out SCORE they should have done more double point days to give the people who can only log in a few times a week a chance.
---
Fucked on both counts without meds/alcohol...
---
That’s the only thing I wanted honestly was that dang raider mask,&amp; possibly the onslaught paint job for all the PA’s...I got a few em,but not for the T-65,which I also wanted,but I don’t have the armor anyhow.
---
S’pose there’s a possibility it may show up In the atom shop at some point,maybe,hopefully.
---
I can farm chickens??? I could make all the dank chicky nuggies ive ever wanted o_o
---
I got back Into the game after wastelanders dropped and I heard some good things about it, I have all 18
---
you can put more if you use blueprints
---
I've just logged into the PTS and from my side it looks like both Bloodied and Adrenal Reaction are not working  
---
My Bloodied Flamer shows in the Pipboy as 75 Damage at both 20% HP and 100% HP  
---
If i put on Nerd Rage the Flamers Damage increases to 89 while at 20% HP
---
Edit: also the Heavy Guns Perks arn't increasing damage on my Flamer or Gatling Laser
---
Edit 2: Adrenal reaction seems to be increasing the damage of my \*NON\* Bloodied guns
---
And if the SBQ focus you, move from the tent top, fence or bunker and help her to land.
---
I can get 2 gourd each foundation easy if I don't put a fence around first but yes gourd footprint is ridiculously large.
---
It's even worse because I got back into the game only recently since launch, so I have to do my rep dailies along with score dailies
---
White spring doesn’t offer much anyways. 
---
I travel to the golf court. Kill all the ghouls there. Then all the ghouls by the houses. All the ghouls by that parking lot. And that’s it. All the enemies are dead. I’ll hit a few player stores that might be there, or spend a good 5-10 minutes browsing the vendors inside the whitespring resort. But there really isn’t anything to do besides that. 
---
Now the stuff you’re asking for sounds nice on paper. But that’s way too much for you to expect for Bethesda to do. 
---
The script machine and the scrap box is very simple and I agree it can very easily be done. The treasure hunting for extra junk, they can probably put down a machine like the one they have for the miner’s treasure map machine you see in Welch (and other places I don’t know fork the top of my head)
---
A store that offers discount? Honestly with hard bargain 3 or a grape mentat, it sounds cool but honestly unless you’re getting 50% off on whatever junk items or things that vendor is selling, I don’t see it being useful.
---
Buying/crafting suits to go back to vault 76? I know it’s not a very lore friendly game. And it’s a video game obviously, but it wouldn’t make sense for any of us to go back inside for any reason at all. Besides to just loot the useless junk inside. 
---
Holotape games, I have no say in this because I don’t bother playing them. But if it’s anything like fallout 4, unless we will get arcade machines to put down in our camp where we can play games, I don’t see this becoming a thing. And if it does, you can get it will be something you need to buy in the atom shop. 
---
The custom perk load outs, will most likely be something you can just do on your pip boy. And I think it’s easier and better than having to go to whitespring just to do that. 
---
I agree whitespring feels empty. I remember heading there and always being crowded. Constantly getting nuked.
---
ive seen a trick, where you plce down two crops on the ground, you than make a blueprint of those two and when using the blueprint, you can place one of these two blueprinted crops very close to others
---
you just have to delete the one you dont need atmfterwards, it sounds a bit complicated but is actually very easy and efficient 👍🏼
---
True, pissing down STREEM is for plebes.
---
Yaaa ☺️
---
There are some work arounds check YouTube .. I think you can get 18 corn on a tile with some trickery
---
Sign me up, GT  : Kinng Killer
---
I am on from like 10am MTm to 2 or 3...
---
Played since release and run FF just for project, know the quercus stuff too if you do that.
---
I hope it does better, but it upsets me to see that they still lock stuff behind timers. They should know from the vault raids that this game is too buggy and too laggy for timer-based challenges
---
well it's the hassle of having a camp ALLLLL the way down there.
---
The whole point of the thread is that you cannot have a 52 man free for all since most people with the current system just have that feature on, so it's a statistic impossibility you will have a FFA. Most players are not even aware that feature exists, so the guy just doesn't make sense when he points out it exists since it's statistically impossible to have a complete FFA.
---
Therefore, unless somehow it was highly organized outside the game, there are no 52 man FFA's like the op wanted.
---
So it's moreso his response to OP that doesn't make any sense. His response to OP is not a solution nor is it an alternative you can actually ever achieve. 99% games are going to have teams even if one or 2 players go in by themselves.
---
Same!  They looked beautiful lit up from inside at night!
---
Is the asterisk there because the only game breaking bug I’ve ever heard of so far is the Ounce of Prevention one, and even that one isn’t 100% game breaking as there is a work around?
---
Yup. With the exception of level up 3 times or the critical shots, I clear them in one day. 
---
Once a week leaving behind a workshop with 10 water pumps, 20 of whatever power connector utilizes the least amount of materials, 10 welcome mats, a structure with five walls/doors and ten stalks of corn.
---
As much as I agree that the Appalachian Brotherhood was a terrible group, they did try to combat the scorched the best they could. They got desperate at the end it seems and started to do whatever was necessary to end the scorched. 
---
They could of done it in a better way, definitely. However the way I see it, all of them had troubles with scorch encounters, had the Brotherhood played nicely with all the factions, they could have had a better chance at taking them out.
---
Maybe the next Unit to come to Appalachia will be a bit nicer towards the people such as the settlers. It seems that the brotherhood has mixed visions on what they should be doing, especially the higher ups. Maxson seemed to want to play nice with everyone and worried about everyone. Where as Taggerdy just had 1 target in mind, the scorched, didn't bother her how it got done.
---
I dislike the unit that got wiped, but we'll have to wait and see how the unit coming to Appalachia acts. So it's well within reason to hate the Appalachian Brotherhood.
---
Some of those skins look excellent, but it’s a shame so many of them are for the handmade. Again.
---
My buddy just retired from playing, so I'm looking for some new running mates. I'm a level 172 but I'm a pretty casual player. Mostly into building and just doing random events. My GT is Free Gabe if you're interested!
---
What's bad about the southern part of the map?
---
Lol https://imgur.com/a/CZRKd70
---
Let us test it more before you push that button
---
Would be nice If you cold make those mannequins do Photomode poses
---
That's not from bethesda but from microsoft.  
---
Look at the wording below the enable button.
---
I'm at work right now, hopped up on sugar and driving my coworkers nuts.  I laughed so hard at this comment right here, that someone screamed at me.  You sir/madam/colonel, did a wonderful thing.  Bless you.
---
I thought it was gonna be the banner or banners basically in FALLOUT 4.
---
Gourds and melons take up a lot of ground space anywhere. You can fit 4 mutfruit or 8-9 tatos on a tile though.
---
It looks great, not what I had in mind but still love it
---
That was the entire point! It was a technicality. He wasn’t trying to give a full on solution. He gave the only technical solution available but people took it literally! Hence the emphasis on “*everyone*”
---
I've heard a lot of good things about Kenshi. I will have to give it a try, whenever my addiction to 76 let's me haha.
---
Maybe ESO? I think it has building as well, but on a smaller scale. I think you can only work in some pre-built houses. Make them your home, decorate them and all that, but probably I'm wrong.
---
No chickens and no eggs, supposedly they roosters .. but it's called a chicken coop, go figure and why the damn no eggs.
---
Greetings, General.
---
the whole point is that I'm not the only one who sees them that way. I mean, even Bethesda sees them as something bad. otherwise there wouldn't be an option to buy levels. it's there because they know a lot of people don't want to be inconvenienced daily for months.
---
I also said, originally, that I'd **wager** a majority of the playerbase dislikes grinding, and that the evidence I have to back this up is the track record so far.
---
which is more than you have, as I pointed out in my previous post, in which I said 'sizeable' rather than 'majority'. as 5k out of 30k is indeed sizeable. assuming those numbers are even accurate to begin with.
---
Holy shit!  This stuff is amazing!  
---
Did you see the mannequins OMG
---
It's not preventing her from landing at all. Just limits her land zone so she just dive bombs 100 times. It's worse when people are on top of the tents too
---
Shouldn't have to use trickery or need YT videos to see how to plant crops in FO76.
---
If you do then something is wrong with the mechanic and they need to fix.
---
It's reward 70 something of the legendary run. So newish depending on how quickly you moved through the levels.
---
Yes I just saw!
---
It'll never happen because this discomfort we're all feeling is by design. That's why they allow you to buy ranks.
---
That aside though, totally agree. I burned out 2 weeks ago &amp; haven't touched the game since solely due to the run.
---
It says "around its exterior" which, I take, implies an adventure mode no-camp zone.
---
Honestly even after what you said,I was expecting a clearer video. It is just a bloody mess and most important of all you don't show what gun it is and the perks you're using.
---
Also wtf are my magic heavies not working?
---
He still absolutely destroys that legendary sheepsquatch. How is that so bad?
---
less likely to get vendor traffic as some people wont want to pay the caps. 
---
scorchbeasts attacks. limited to build area due to where it is. not very aesthetic =0
---
SS Armor is ugly as the back of a fridge
---
Assassin's pump action
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure this gonna be mostly available for private server, especially if we can have mods that change scripts, add function, news gears and more.
---
Seriously doubt any of that is going to be available.
---
There's a trick to it
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h7vz2g/quick\_tip\_you\_can\_use\_blueprints\_to\_plant\_crops/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h7vz2g/quick_tip_you_can_use_blueprints_to_plant_crops/)
---
Do not worry what others think. See for yourself: if rewards that can be grabbed from the run are somehow important to you, or you just like it, who is to judge you for paying for it? 
---
People spend money as they please on things that make them happy. Be it some concert ticket, new shoes, donation or subscribing to a streamer, some unique skin in some online game, or chicken coop in F76. It's not for others to judge, and only judge should be yourself. 
---
If I liked any of the rewards, would not give a second thought and buy it right away if it's too far for me to grind for.
---
&gt; If you are burnt out then its your own doing, nobody forced you. And if you think the rewards arent worth the grind, then why did you engage? We had all of the rewards listed even before the season started.
---
This can sum it all up. Really annoying to constantly see people complaining about this or being ""forced"" to play NW when trying to look for meaningful posts. There's enough to complain about in this game without people pretending that self-inflicted issues are bethesda's fault
---
You did the right thing. That kind of power cannot exist.
---
might be a fix related to the duping people were doinb
---
Meant 150, my bad. It's been a long fucking day irl and I'm running on fumes. 
---
Also, it takes me ten minutes to load into a single map. I'm glad your internet allows you to do that in less time, but not everyone has that luxury. 
---
Also, I'm glad you don't have PVP happen to you while doing workshops. Again, not everyone has that luxury. Your experience alone does not account for a majority. 
---
Essentially what I'm saying, in case you missed it, is that upping the numbers would be prohibitive for some players who have a difficult enough time with a game they still play because they enjoy it. Again, I'm glad that your experience has made server hopping and workshop claiming and legendary farming not-too-difficult. But, again, *that is not a luxury afforded to everyone.*
---
Then they have to think of 12 other items to get to 100.
---
I still hang out at the Whitespring.  You can find my house on the driving range.  We can totally hang out.
---
PS I have a scrapbox &lt;3
---
I would love it if thay just put it back as it was before lol
---
Gotta love them edibles
---
Even though I hate lore breaking, I find that idea pretty good, I would love to see a full suit of plate power armor and regular knight outfit, very themed based around BOS.
---
I complain a lot that they hire too many artists and not enough devs for this game, but whoever was behind that bunker can stay
---
Just in time for a bloodied nerf lmao
---
I have nothing left to do so this gives me a reason to log in and do some events. I wish there was more variety though. A larger pool of weekly events would be good so I could save playing for weekends.
---
Fight the power!
---
I don't think it'd be those kinds of mods. It'd be like CC ie paid amateur DLC.
---
That read very clearly as a nerf when I saw that text too. My guess is that the nerf applies to everything, but bloodied is most obvious since it is so damn powerful. They probably apply the Bloodied damage increase based on the base weapon damage now, instead of taking base damage plus weapon perks and then bloodied on the final calculation or some crap. Either that or they put a flat maximum cap on the amount base damage can be increased by.
---
So THIS Is when they're planning to release that enclave PA that's been sitting in the gamefiles since before Wastelanders...
---
Great, I got some hefty paintjob mods for that bad boy ready for almost 5 months now.
---
It didn't add to the discussion. That's why it got downvoted. It wasn't reasonable to say such a thing that statistically never happens.
---
"OH you want WHOLE apple? How about a small slice of an orange? They are both tech. fruit!"
---
Guy wanted 52 man FFA option for all 52 players. Some person said you can just go in by yourself and fight against other teams. It's just a dumb response.
---
It was rather exploitable.  Keeping it in as well detracted from the rest of the game.
---
So sad the game ended like this...
---
"My chicken whatever gives me sh*t instead of eggs"... ridiculous!
---
Ah ok....thank you
---
Ok. I hope your faith proves rewarding, and that the update brings new synergies to your playstyle
---
Advice, not do it for me
---
monkey pog champ
---
I assume people were buying as you leave so it duplicates
---
My theory is that any form of competition they look at as a bad thing because they never did any of that growing up. If they did, they would likely receive participation trophies etc. Simply put, if they lose, they rage and then make a post about how bad the game mode is.
---
Yeah this is why at first i wanted a local private server... Like many other player, or event hosted by Bethesda but with different characters and be able to customize everything in your server.
---
"Armor Ace and the Power Patrol" is going to be a GI Joe-esque thing the SCORE board is based on; not a lot to do with armors in general. And unfortunately I think it's a little too late for them to model a suit of medieval knight armor and squeeze it into the next season.
---
I agree with the spirit of this suggestion, though. My character is a Wasteland Don Quixote roleplay and I'd literally *always* wear medieval armor if they came out with one. Maybe a future season will be based on Grognak the Barbarian?
---
ap refresh. it tells you on the armour
---
I don’t think they nerfed bloodied per say, I think they need the combination damage of nerd rage, adrenal reaction and bloodied
---
I don't mind the dailies really. It gives me something to do besides roaming randomly. Also, most of the stuff for daily actually is what I normally do.
---
It is grindy and repetitive some days though.
---
Other people covered the 1k DMG requirement for SBQ, but also keep in mind the game won't register hits correctly in several situations.
---
If you just fast traveled in, your hits might not count
---
If the creature is "already dead" server side, your hits won't count
---
If the creatures life bar is rubberbanding, your hits might not counting (but sometimes they do).
---
For short fights these can all be an issue, long fight, I'm not sure. 
---
Grab a flamer, imo, lots of damage in a short amount of time. Get your 1k damage in, then go back to Gatling.
---
From the looks of the gameboard and the design of the Armor Ace logo its more likely GI Joe inspired. The “bad guy” even looks like a commie knockoff Cobra. I think the BoS themed season devs were talking about it still to come, probably season 3 with the rest of the BoS.
---
It’s kind of random when it’s called “powered,” since any piece can have AP refresh
---
Shouldn’t be that hard. But hey I’m just a lumber yard supervisor not a video game maker. Still excited for it tho
---
I've played 3-4 games the last few nights and there were no hackers on PC. But you do find them, especially on double XP or free to play weekends etc. You can usually just join another game though.
---
You should get the option to give then to her to complete the quest. If it’s not appearing i’m not sure why, but my game gas been jacked up on lag recently so I definitely would keep that possibility in mind. If that’s the case maybe a new server could fix it...no promises it doesn’t just get worse
---
And a nice smiling Vaultboy sign letting the next person to come along that they can have it!
---
 Another Handmade Skin and Pump Shotgun Skin.  Greeeaaaatt.
---
You know I was also thinking of checking it out for its home building because I saw on Twitter [someone actually built what looks like a vault from fallout as their player home](https://twitter.com/TESOnline/status/1293545546028908545?s=19)
---
So there must be some stuff that lets you express creativity, I've heard the ESO building community is actually pretty huge 
---
I just don't know if I can make it through the combat haha, I hateee mmo combat, and even tho ESO tries to present its combat as more action base, it's still really just mmo hotbar combat 
---
Maybe it's better now tho, I do wanna check it out eventually
---
Same, I expected either that retextured flag from F4 or maybe a reskin of the Pioneer Scout banners you can get, but NOPE! Piece of rebar jammed into a tire with some scrap metal art stuck on the top seems logical.
---
I’ve killed hundreds of queens and 99.9% of all of her drops have been scrip-only?
---
I think we're just talking about the public events that give T-notes.
---
I couldn't have said it better. And I tried.
---
I gotta love the Chinese commie skins for the armors.
---
But still no Chinese Jumpsuit or the Commando hat.
---
Also the Battle-pass has no Communist themed weapon skins. There should be atleast one, maybe for the MG42?
---
Ahh oh well, and yeah they'll probably do something with Grognak in the future with him racing against the wizard guy
---
and you shouldn't
---
it's not hard to make caps in the game. certainly not worth risking a ban for.
---
Ah the big ones like tea time or uranium fever? I see plenty of those around aswel all the time
---
It's an issue, but... quick workaround: always check if someone is at your camp before login off or changing server.
---
It's better for everyone ;)
---
I’m a new player and I need caps and nobody will help me get caps I die everytime I see a 1 level scorched
---
They might do more costumes for halloween like the gladiator, samurai, pirate outfits. So medieval suit of armor could definitely fit into that
---
Like I said, this was months back.  They would fall off and show damage numbers but if you went up to them they could still be pulled manually, lots of people were reporting the same thing on this sub.  I'm guessing they have probably fixed it since the five or more months since I ran into it.  I just got into the habit of pulling them manually after it happened to me.
---
Would the dresses be ok?
---
You shouldn't trust it.
---
Same to you, at this point we can only wait and see how Bethesda handles the BoS.
---
How do you deposit them into your stash?
---
Morgantown airport there are usually a few radscorpion spawns at match start.
---
I don't mind doing that when I'm playing normally, but when I'm server hopping, kinda annoying
---
Vamp exp 90 weight 50 cal is my best from her.
---
Exactly what I thought, 100% reminds me of cobra commander
---
Ah, I figured it was going to be bos considering the name. You're most likely right.
---
How else am I gonna do enough damage to kill it?
---
Would the asylum dress one get me banned?
---
are you sure it's not a level 30 item? ;)
---
Been confirmed for forever.
---
What kinda crap is that?? I was gonna make some bitchin sunny side up eggs
---
Heck I'm just enjoying having something to grind for period! I've been going pretty quick with it because I want to make sure I finish before it ends. Turns out I've gone pretty fast but I don't care. I did the same with Destiny 2 season ranks and honestly once the grind is done you can now focus on other stuff like dailies and all that.
---
The game could be near perfect in terms of no bugs, everything functioning properly and people would still find something to complain about. I'll just be here enjoying myself.
---
man, I remember the crowd first being at flatwoods in the beta (I queued five minutes to use the weapon bench once), then at the Whitesprings, occasionally in biv’s room, but now there never seems to be a group or crowd anywhere. A little sad :(
---
Ehh just go for it, it's really not that much if you play everyday. If you can make anything from playing it's worth it!! Lol
---
Stop complaining about complaining about other people complaining about things. You're just as bad as they are yet lack the self awareness to realise it.
---
Same. I’ve only been playing for about three weeks but I’ve ran out of junk to do that isn’t time locked by dailies. What’s the point of unlocking more gear when there’s no end game to use better gear?
---
Glad I’m not the only one
---
I don’t see how they would ban you? Like not making a negative comment genuinely curious since some people put up toilet paper for 30k in vendors. If it’s the fact you suddenly go from 100 caps to 30k what if for some far off reason someone bought your toilet paper for 30k (would almost certainly never happen) but that’d be a “legit” jump.
---
If I see someone with grenade launcher or gauss shotguns, I don't think damn, this is unfair, I think good, this guy is a noob and I can easily take him out after I plan my movement strat to nail them.
---
Reskins for days!
---
Yay ok :)
---
Lol, whoa...a real badass over here, fellas! You heard it here first! Anybody with disposable income, check what this guy thinks so you can not be an “idiot” for spending your money, however you may choose.
---
In all seriousness tho, the rewards are pretty lacking whether you spend time or money. They clearly did not match the player investment worth, regardless.
---
I would venture there is a reason why you have not done it....
---
...and a healthy dose of skepticism is not a bad thing.
---
That said, you can succeed in this game without whatever it is you found there.
---
I really wish bethesda would stop cramming masks and hats together into single pieces of headwear and would allow us to wear all hats and masks together already.  The metal mask portion of that supervillain headwear could be combined with so many other hats to look awesome... but as it is I'd never wear the ushanka it's going to be glued to.
---
Well you see he emptied out an entire magazine to kill it. When before it probably took 5 shots.
---
Should I buy the caps?
---
Atom shop. Like one of the very early items.
---
It's not worth the risk. What asylum dress are you after?
---
Just get rid of the stupid level up ones.
---
I'd also be happy if they either got rid of SCORE for good and brought back the old system (I want atoms, not a bunch of garbage skins I'll never use), or make it so the rewards are better (aka more atoms and not skins...seriously fuck the skins).
---
The green glowing one was available in the atomic shop for a while
---
Yeah! And fire axes!
---
I dont know why you are so unhappy. I've been a massive supporter of this since release.. even when other people have been slamming it for bugs etc.
---
I'm not unhappy by any stretch lol.
---
Red pink yellow blue or green I’m a new player and I found one and someone shot me before I could get it:(
---
Please Bethesda dumb this game down for me so I can get the rewards for not doing it.
---
Yeah I think this is probably the reaction most non diehards get.
---
It depends on the day for me. Sometimes I'll be really into it and spend hours farming junk, ammo, XP, etc. Other days I spend about an hour maybe two just doing some dailies and then I'm done.
---
ANNNNND YOU!  win my upvote for the day!
---
This is fucking brilliant.
---
I dont like this, I think it effects mid range players the most too. You hit 50 now everything is super tough, you cant go back to an easy area and you dont have any good weapons.
---
Gunna have to feel it out once it drops i guess. That really sucks if the dps is garbage. Whats the point of having almost zero hp then
---
Fire Axes actually got a set of three skins a while back
---
Man i had hopes for atleast one Commie themed weapon skin, but there is not a single one in that battle-pass.
---
We could have had a "Chinese" MG42 skin. Basically light-olive green coloring with few propaganda slogans, same as the Handmades Communist style skin.
---
Are you planning to jump on top of a Foosball table and make car noises or something?
---
That is an incredibly stupid reason to downvote someone. He didn’t want 52 man FFA. He just threw in the last two cents he had on the situation. He gave a solution which will never happen because it’s something you could think about and it lends itself to discussion. It still pertains to the subject at hand, it just didn’t go in the direction everyone else wanted it to. 
---
Let me give you another example. Let’s talk about Atom Joe who is on a thread discussing the amount of daily challenges in the Seasons. The thread is talking about how long it would take if you do everything everyday. Atom Joe chimes in and says he just wishes that Bethesda would add atoms after the season is done to give an incentive to still log in after completing the season. By that logic he should be downvoted because it is both statistically improbable and doesn’t lend itself directly to the subject at hand, rather than simply having a formal discussion about how each person thinks things could or should be handled
---
They did?!!? Rats!! Missed them!
---
You die to weak scorched but your priority is a dress?
---
No. You could be banned or scammed out of your money, and it's not hard to make caps.
---
Say what you want about the game, the community is always fantastic haha
---
Seriously don't. I more or less view that as cheating and all you're going to do it ruin the enjoyment of making your own caps for the first time.
---
You're new and still learning, do what the rest of us did and slowly work your way up, I promise you'll do okay :)
---
First  video ever rendered on ps4 pro not sure how to make quality better willing to learn.
---
Don't crap your pants yet. They can only have one mutation x run. And if it's the anti stealth one,go in with a tank friend.
---
Where is it in our inventory? Wall Decor?
---
Yeah kinda so I can sell it for caps so I can get a better weapon than a ten mm pistol
---
15% isnt a significant amount. If we were to let 15% of the games players decide what we do with the games it would 100% kill the game off. But I digress, as 15% does deserve to be heard, just not given the majority of the vote 
---
And my proof, as was pointed out earlier, is the fa t that they added a grind for the legendary run. They added a grind for gold bullion in wastelanders. They are adding a grind with the new legendary perks. If a "majority" of players disliked it, I would imagine they would stop adding them in, since it would drive more and more players away.
---
Thank you so much! I’m on PS4, and would be happy to give you caps and or whatever you need to make it! 🙂
---
I don't believe that's cannibalism technically 
---
I do understand what you're saying though, it's weird we can devour only humanoids on the spot and not animals and stuff haha
---
Wouldn’t be a cannibal if you eat other species. Likely a different perk that allows you to much on newly dead animal corpses instead of cooking the meat first.  Most other species already have parts you can pick up to eat. Getting a random chance to get a cool mutation from animals would be fascinating
---
&gt; I die everytime I see a 1 level scorched 
---
Then this may not be the game for you and consider something where you can adjust the difficulty. It gets really hard when you get to level 30 and the main plot starts sending you into areas with level 68 super mutants. Caps aren't going to make it easier.
---
Lol idk how to make it better plz help
---
I know. Because it involves a load screen, nobody seems to want to go inside Whitesprings anymore unless they need to spend caps quickly.
---
They havent been in the shop for a long while. This is one of them (apologies for the long link, it's a google image) https://www.google.com/search?q=fo76+fire+axe+skin+set&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9xZqh1JvrAhWL0YUKHTY8DyMQ2-cCegQIABAB&amp;oq=fo76+fire+axe+skin+set&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzoCCCk6BAgeEApQ61VYgVtgql1oAHAAeACAAZsBiAG0A5IBAzQuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=vgQ3X73uKYujlwS2-LyYAg&amp;bih=586&amp;biw=360&amp;client=ms-android-samsung-gn-rev1&amp;prmd=sniv&amp;safe=strict#imgrc=epGuEeLeZX1SIM
---
Which discord by chance?
---
In seasons 2 pics. I see captain cosmos and zorbo. So does this mean if we grind out seasons 2. We might get the fishbowl helmet of cosmos? Or was that included. I'm level 92 almost there.
---
Instabil does not have to be a hack, I am a sniper build and with a good scopes lever action headshot they sometimes don’t even get downed
---
We all started at the beginning. You will level up and get better and caps will flow. You have to be patient about it.
---
But I might be able to help you out with some dresses. I'll have to check what I have.
---
Unfortunately some are atomic shop purchase only.
---
How you love handmade so much bethsda lol    Poor fixer
---
If you want the caps and have $5 to spend, go for it.
---
They will probably use the PTS system where you create a copy of your character for other worlds, and maybe the re balance changes will apply when transferring over for certain effects and weapons. You don't get to save your new progress on modded servers that can be transferred back, but you can transfer your vanilla progress over to private worlds.
---
I wouldn’t.
---
Hey, where did you see it? I can’t seem to find game board and logo pictures anywhere
---
Everyone says I’ll get banned 😔
---
Hmmm wouldn’t be much different. Same thing different style. But nice.
---
Anyone have the most recent version or most recent translator file? I accidently deleted it and only have the mar 26th version.
---
I get what you’re saying. I’m saying that I was able to do it on a silo run three days ago...albeit, I only did one run so not sure about it’s consistency anymore.
---
I imagine they use a few accounts to farm and make caps. And then maybe transfer caps to other accounts once maxed. All it takes is for bethesda to catch one of them doing dodgy shit and then tracing who they bought stuff off/traded with (i imagine there is some kind of transaction record).
---
Or maybe they cannot. Still not worth the risk IMO
---
If I got banned could I make another character? Or new account?
---
Hey that looks pretty cool actually haha
---
I know it's probably a hassle to build, but it may lool cool if you move it over to be floating over the big satellite dish that's facing straight upwards that's right by the entrance to West Tek
---
oh, btw, i added ya as a friend, in case you ever need anything, feel free to stop by my camp, and if i can help, i'd gladly do it (Name's \_Hades. )
---
Still waiting on a skin for my double barrel..
---
This is **JUST** what I was thinking about this OP and I am seriously questioning going back playing because I think its busted and just not worth my time because I suspect the gameplay loop just doesn't work.
---
Not enough permancy for me and just too much shoot up things for  dead survivors (My BIGGEST peeve)
---
they did it because it's profitable, not because it's what the playerbase wants. again, I really hope you're just pretending for internet points.
---
you also conveniently glossed over every point I made in my last 2 posts.
---
OCD when it comes to completing certain things in games such as seasons passes even if I dislike the game I'm playing
---
The longshoreman outfit never shows backpacks at least.
---
Did you just pick up the tapes, or did you listen to them?
---
oh that BoS bunker, i'm a free state gal but the classic fallout demand i have that pretty.
---
Someone might have shot you but they can't actually kill you unless you shoot them back. 
---
Nevertheless I may have a pink asylum outfit you can have - Xbox
---
Ah true. I imagine if one two accounts went from 110 to 30k then they met someone and they went from 200 to 30k and the seller did it multiple times a day
---
*CAMP budget crying intensifies*
---
https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa
---
It seems to me Bethesda just messed some things up not intentionally "nerf" Bloodied. Plus, this is day one of this new update on PTS, changes will occur.
---
It would be nice if you could complete the legendary run by just doing challenges period
---
Toot toot
---
That's a terrible reason to buy caps. 
---
How about you just like... play the game and learn and earn stuff.
---
Awesome, see you around Appalachia!
---
I wasn't wondering.
---
Yup. Must have it.  I'll scrap and redesign my entire CAMP one I have that.
---
But now you have this information. Buried deep within your mind. Forever.
---
The Whitespring needs to be a true MMORPG style hub. I think the Top of the World mezzanine level would be good for this as well.
---
Great thanks so much
---
YOU'RE GIVING ALL US BROTHERHOOD FOLKS A BAD NAME, COME HOME.
---
There's something to be said about that though, the fact I also tried this the other day lol. You get the prompt to pick the items up but nothing happens.
---
The fashnacht event literally got delayed because wastelanders destroyed critter spawns.
---
I am guessing these hacks are mostly on PC?
---
https://discord.gg/pK8RnZ
---
I think Bethesda likes camo and ghillie more than we do.
---
One of my friends has managed to put it in mid air somehow
---
What did you have in mind?
---
She had weapons and technology she simply did not need.
---
And?
---
Yeah, the last two times for me.  Started two? weeks ago.
---
Which is still good, the damage that is. Before it was just broken
---
Sometimes I wish there were moments like this but the canonical explanation would be that they are on chems. Like I think there would be a lot more charm and humanity to raiders if you found one on a bench on day tripper being like "Nah man, just take a seat with me, I left my gun over there. Kinda here to relax and you're seriously harshing my vibe."
---
This is the way. Ad Victoriam o7
---
I would actually be really into seasons if I didn't have to log in every day to have a chance to complete the track.    
---
I wouldn't even mind if the tasks were harder or more involved.
---
Unfortunately SPECIAL is still capped to 15 each.
---
Damn. Hopefully it comes back, I'll have to keep an eye out for that.
---
Everyone except me.
---
Not nearly as serious as the Ounce of Prevention bug.
---
The event ended up still taking place.
---
The long-term turning off of player vending would rate higher in my opinion on biggest, most awful bugs.
---
ikr, how cool would it be if it gave us eggs.
---
oh boy more handmade skins
---
And I wanted to share that information with you.
---
Really? Are you on xbox?
---
You’re welcome.
---
Yeah sounds like the end of power levelling alts.
---
The mannequins. Holy my brahmin! Yes! Yes!
---
Thank you very much! I hope we will get to see black painting for the scout armor. With these theme it would be appropriate to include black paint for scout as some sort of clandestine ops paint, take snake eyes for example
---
Would you do it?
---
Id say buy first and it won't get you, but ive been hit 4 times so far.
---
Duuuuude, i coulda made a damn cake
---
It’s “anticlimactic”
---
I would have thought that would have been obvious.
---
Having reading here and given some though I have to agree with the long term progression. It gives something to work towards on, and I really don't think that a level 300, or even a level 500 should be able to max all legendary perks. Remember that the maxed out perks are very OP, 30 additional special points for example. You could just start by ranking up all, or most important cards to level 2 or 3 for example. And imagine if they originally ONLY had 3 ranks and then say, level 400 would max it out, everyone would be happy? Only 18 specials or whatever you'd be losing on the 4th rank on the other perks. But atleast we could have it level 400, ugh.. I'll atleast take the 4th rank even it will need some work.. Finally, I don't think **everyone** will **need** to max out these in the first place. I believe a level 1000 should, and "earns" to be more "legendary" than a level 300.
---
Are you on PC or console? You may need to run down to Bestbuy or Walmart and get a gaming mouse that can have DPI sensitivity settings. There are many videos on how to improve aim on youtube and they are for other games but do apply to NW too. AimLab is a free aim trainer on Steam and it might help you. I was just like you, never played pvp shooting and never did non-vats shooting. So at first I had no idea on what to do. I just kept playing because I enjoyed it. Now I can regularly get 10-20 kills a game playing solo. My fps aiming experience is only 1 year or however long ago NW came out. I am not the best aim though, most of my success comes to position and movement and sneaking up on a group of people. You may find that a 22 inch high refresh rate monitor helps too. I was on an old 32 in tv, smaller screen made it easier to scan for enemies. Look up Shroud Nuclear Winter and watch his play style when the mode first came out.
---
When you build your critical meter switch to a shotgun for the crit, all pellets should hit and count as separate critical hits. Should make that one a lot quicker.
---
So is there a unique item similar to the ammo machine from the current season?
---
Mininukes aren't in NW I don't think, could you be getting hit by someone with a ton of nuka grenades you think?
---
I don’t like this idea, keep daily’s, just make all challenges give your more points to rank. Stop ruining the game, making it easier and more boring to appease those who only play 2 hours a week.
---
Guess they don't learn or might have chosen to not change since it was a blueprint of future events back when vault 94 raids were released.
---
Sounds good. I'll send you a inv tomorrow. Not sure what you mean on the latter half tho lol
---
Absolutely man, no need for caps though! Please let me know if you’d prefer Flannel Shirt &amp; Jeans or Undershirt &amp; Jeans. Dm me your PSN and I’ll sort that out for you in about 15 mins.
---
If you're on PC I have quite of bit of acid and maybe some lead too, I won't ask much for a trade
---
Well it's cross-platform
---
holy crap you mean they are trying to make money with this game?!??!  I had no idea,  WHO WOULD DO THAT?!?!?!
---
No it clear as day, he shot like 20 of them in a row without any delay.  
---
Edit: Also they make the distinctive whirling sound that mini nukes do when airbone
---
I want a rolling pin in destiny 2
---
You can buy the serum recipie from a player vendor or the MODUS terminal. Players are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. You can also get 1 mutation from rad exposure per server.
---
That hurts my soul just thinking about it.
---
Who knows, usually they have some kind of assault rifle and kill with just 1 shot to the body, happens to me all the time even when I have the marine or power armor
---
Seems reasonable. I mean they have been gone forever and if they come back they should be as to prevent the plague from spreading. As I am sorry, but “technology” will not keep you safe.
---
*SLUUUUURP* just another day in the wasteland
---
The art direction in this game is amazing. It’s a great merging of old style with new style. I’m in love with the look of this game, and that BoS bunker definitely deserves it.
---
Sure. When?
---
Did he at least tell you why crossed the road before you killed him?  Or did you kill him before he crossed the road?
---
Right now I got him spawned
---
Friendly fire perk to heal, and you dont shutoff ARIC computer on your run? The coded door to the left of the main computer, in there the shut off code? Sometimes its worth it.
---
Yeah because this game is **Barely** Fallout (and only because of the Wastelanders Expansion)  besides that its just a Comedy show.
---
Serums are the best way to get them
---
So that's not the vertibird PA, that seems to be a variant based off the T-60, so that probably swings it back to being an ATX item at some point.
---
There's some nice looking stuff in there. I'd have to chop the entire 1st floor off my current camp to use any of it mind you, as I'm currently at max budget.
---
I believe it's close to 225.
---
The arcade shooter game seems pretty unique. If you mean unique like has a functionality for gameplay like the ammo convertor idk, but id say the PA display fits that since theres currently no way to do that in the game.
---
Same, today was my first. I usually log out before the challenges update. Today I didn’t. I was also in a quest when the switch happened. I’m way ahead on the legendary run so it was disappointing, but I’m not too upset about it
---
Bethesda doesn't care, stop posting this shit, lol
---
Me too, but im finished now.
---
I can invite you to the game what’s you Gt?
---
Do they seem more resilient than the lvl40 Glowing Mole Miners in the current patch? Also, is every Mole Miner in Uranium Fever still a glowing variant? My download speed for the PTS is so slowww
---
The eagle mug should be available in real life.
---
fuck, you're good.
---
Lol no one really gives a shit enough to not buy stuff especially this community
---
My house rules: 
---
Only fast travel back to camp after adventuring on foot and usually if i have a tent I do not do that.
---
Do not cheese the game.
---
Trade with other players without exploiting them, cheap and fair prices. Sometimes they even let me buy huge piles of crappy junk or ammo in bulk although they always act paranoid like I am going to steal their 2000 38 rounds. So surpised when i offer 500 caps for it all. Prices less than one do exist even if the game does not allow for it.
---
Roleplay my character, do not worry about min maxing events, do not join the rat race.
---
that'll be the one Appalachia update. nice
---
Could you please tell us if every enemy is lv 100 now? Like what level are the scorched at Morgan Town Airport or the deathclaw in deathclaw Island.
---
It might be that now days. I've always been told by dataminers that it is 180 for worlds spawns and 160 for containers, but I don't keep up with it for each patch.
---
Scam fest shit bank💪
---
The early levels are relatively easy to work though with just the dailys and weeklys.  Double score weekend will help you a lot.
---
I’m in the mid-upper 70’s RN - The levels are about 2900 score per, which takes a lot longer to get through.    
---
Soome people have suggested creating a 2nd char to do the level up challenge - much easier and faster to level up a new char than a char over L200 :)
---
If you are intent on completing it one way or another, Try and find the 30-45 min to do all the dailys  to play though the lower levels and save the atoms for buying the higher levels
---
should eliminate the "one-shot" complaints.
---
Hang on, not logged in yet.  Stuck on the Bethesda screen.
---
What I dont like about the season pass models is that EVERY OTHER GAMING COMPANY IN THE DAMN WORLD IS USING THEM, and you kinda feel a bit shit when you miss a couple of the rewards at the end because you've been trying to complete another season pass in another game.
---
Companies should either start:
---
A) Allowing people who havent completed the season pass to still earn the rewards after the season but only if they reach the rank they missed out on last time (so that it's still there but they still have to grind for it) or
---
B) make season passes a little bit less of a grind so that they can be completed earlier, but the time left can be put towards additional rewards further on in the pass (things like currency every 5 or so levels(for example every 5 extra levels rewards gold bullion, caps or scrip)) so that there is still something to do. Destiny 2 has this implemented and it's good to know that you can still rank up and gain rewards even when you have completed the season pass and obtained all the items.
---
There are some non glowing but those are the lvl 100 ones I noticed. 
---
They die about the same speed as before. They do give more xp as well.
---
[DID SOMEONE SAY MEDIEVEAL FASHION](https://imgur.com/a/67VijGs)
---
Ya fr I would love some more chivalrous things to wear, a knight power armor suit would be boss
---
I never said to make it easier. If i play 12 hours during the weekend and you play 12 hours across the week, we both still play 12 hours.
---
Nice! Looks like I'll be redoing all my camps now!
---
is this the same problem that people post about multiple times a day, or a different bug? it's hard to keep up.
---
Might be a dumb question, but will the season 1 stuff be gone forever if we don’t unlock it in time?
---
K I’m ready when you are
---
When I think of a hammock it is white and between two medium trees. Though thinking about it the trees would make it hard to place and color is whatever
---
Thanks, didnt know
---
I'm playing the game and interacting with the players who are playing the game.  Most of the people I talk don't mind the grind and are enjoying the game.  The Bethesda forums and here have plenty of posts of people finding new and exciting things happening all the time.  It's really not complaints all the time.  I see positive posts all the time.  CAMP builds, new game discoveries, new achievements...same as any other game people are enjoying.  I also work in IT Support so I know what its like to feel like all you do is hear the bad.  When people are having fun they don't necessarily post it all over the place.  Some do, but most don't especially console players, which FO76 playerbase is for the most part.
---
Weird, haven't seen that one lol
---
How often do you see hackers? I only seem to get them at really late hours, usually go 2-3 weeks without seeing any, and then one night I'll have a hacker every game lol it's weird
---
Not every enemy. It varies between 50 75 and 100. There was a mirelurk Queen at lvl 100 I saw. She’s pretty Tanky.
---
25 was the lowest I saw. It was a rad roach.
---
F
---
Defend from outside the zone (use a sniper rifle).
---
Little slower, but prevents what happened to you.
---
IF they want the same shop, they have to kill the NPCs first.  And you get credit for the defend.
---
That is absolutely my plan.
---
Very easy mistake to make
---
This is looking good
---
It’s the door to the circus train car prefab that was from the Treasure Hunter event.
---
Indeed so.  Experience with the Ops should help develop those.
---
Who the hell responds to a 3 month old post on Reddit? Lol
---
Looks like circus trailer doors. I don't have it to verify, unfortunately.
---
I think its staying the same except more xp per challenge.
---
I agree. I enjoyed it. 
---
People complain that they have to get on every day. That Bethesda tries getting people to play everyday. Like every other living game, BRs included. 
---
Just because there are daily challenges doesn't mean you have to do it. In 2 weeks, I cleared the first third without even trying to. And I definitely didn't play every day. 
---
I think, as always, people complain too much. In short, I agree with you. I like it.
---
If you think its profitable to run players off, then you don't really understand what is profitable.
---
And to your point of mobile game tactics, the legendary run doesn't require purchase. Nor does atoms. Both can be completed by simply playing the game consistently. It's your choice to be lazy, not play the game and buy spaces on the run, and it's not forced. Mobile games will usually lock that kind of shit behind money, grind or not.
---
And If your only argument is the **ability** to purchase levels in the games battlepass, not a **requirement**, then I will repeat, mobile games have far more insidious methods for scamming money, including daily limits that can be paid to remove, limiting actual play time that can be paid to remove, and ads after every level. None of which appear in this game.
---
People might disagree but. I'm glad it's nerfed. It was just too powerful imo.
---
 Hopefully it'll have a positive change and updates to make it not too OP but not nerfed to oblivion and maybe even bring another build into the meta. 
---
Because rn it's just junkies and bloodied. Perhaps see more viability in berserkers or mutants.

This. One for each armor type. I can get on board with a new paint for all armors each season
---
if you're on xbone i can hook you up
---
Agreed, S S armor makes the previous ones look very detailed. Justfinished mine and it was so lame looking I went straight to shop and got a camo skin. It's better I just don't like how the chest plate is 20 ft from your neck.

Plan: Circus cage trailer ( https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Circus_cage_trailer )
---
Was a reward from this limited time event: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_Hunter
---
It doesn't have to be lore breaking. 
---
Maybe the Brotherhood looted a private collection while they were trekking across the country and modified some platemail to include BoS insignias for some special force.
---
A less lore intensive way could be to take a destroyed building in Charleston and put a door on it that leads to a museum that hasn't been looted, and the Player could just apply BoS stuff to it, or other faction insignias
---
I actually don't drink alcohol in the game anymore since I learned that it slows experience points afaik.
---
As long as they leave in the Xp repeatable, I'm fine with whatever they do.
---
Sorry to be impatient but you loaded in?
---
Yeah the commie commander shit looks awesome!
---
Yes, actually I have seen the same thing. That some games give you "infinite rewards" after level 100. The most popular petition so far are atoms. 
---
If you could get 1 atom every 10 SCORE or something like that EVERYONE would be so happy. Of course this would mean the repeatable is deactivated after you finish the pass.
---
Thanks for wanting to help by trading with me, though I was no wing base and wanted a good base and I thought I ask this subreddit for help and there’s a good location with both acid and lead though the problem I’m having is that I can’t seem to place the camp we’re I can’t get both nodes
---
I see them too often tbh, must be because of my lower rank in NW, or it could be the fact that Bethesda charges the full value for the game in South America but doesn't use any of the Amazon server clusters available here, so who knows which servers I'm being placed at.
---
XBox - Alehldean
---
I have a habit of leaving my system on so if I don't answer you I'm AFK, not ignoring you.
---
Floor decor
---
Your right OP and don't let anyone else tell you different because they're just Fuding.
---
I have come to the same conclusion after over 100+ hours and I if they don't make a SERIOUS change with the upcoming Brotherhood of Steel expansion....I'm OUT!
---
&gt; The building thing is actually funny.
---
So they finally noticed, ha ha.
---
Thanks for the replies, now I am bummed out that I missed it.
---
Nope.  Tried to restart the game.  About to restart the system.
---
That's what I thought. Insanely disappointed because the one that's out rn had been out 3 or 4 times in the past month.
---
Had me at thicc
---
Work smarter not harder.
---
Everything is the same. Your inventory is the same, shared and will be updated on both regardless on playing on the private or public server.
---
Private servers are the same size worlds as the public servers and as far as I know there is no limit on loot.
---
K cool just reply to the comment once your in
---
Seeing as my game doesn’t load fully in anymore, I completely agree. Every new piece of content seems to be one step closer to an actually unfixable game
---
So then give us a daily login bonus. Warframe has a nice system like that. Bigger/more weekly challenges would make things a lot more manageable for people that can't play the game 40+ hours a week.
---
So much better with the rewards but at last I se myself rebuilding my camp yet again. LoL. I have been where I am for almost two months now and really like it. Oh well.
---
I’m excited about the camp stuff - greenhouse, foosball table, planter, bunker, etc. I do wish there was less weapon and armor skin, but I think I will be happy.
---
Kinda, some things like power armor and bobbleheads have a chance to spawn when someone enters the area. If you are the only one, they just have 1 chance to spawn.
---
Id love a mutation requiring power armour or gas masks in the burning mine, would be pretty great in a full squad
---
We are still missing storefront images for the Enclave PA.
---
It's all good. I don't really bother with this stuff anyways when I want to do a nuke anymore, which is why I haven't tried to see if it still happens.  I just clip through the walls and doors now to get it over with quickly.
---
I have 8 levels to do how I wish so I might max that one. Getting the mod for the Cooler mod takes 8 stinking badges.
---
Yes you can transfer, no there isn’t less loot, yes they can play with you
---
Hmmmmmm
---
hrhr, I highly doubt that.
---
The Investors - the most brutal, ruthless, and soul-free organization in the Fallout universe. Blood Eagles and the Enclave alike tremble before them. Wastelanders have been exiled, tortured, and beaten to death for nothing more than daring to suggest that they can be reasoned with. Even mindless Feral Ghouls will freeze and then run the other way upon hearing the Name of They Who Must Not Be Named...
---
I did it to a L7 the other day (before the sorry emote)
---
Didn’t see the L7 on the roof sniping - while I was one hitting the stuff from the ground.  
---
Oops.   Sorry for taking your kills - didn’t see ya.
---
Yeah, you can bounce back and forth as you please - your camp and possessions will all be there!
---
There shouldn’t be smaller loot, but I would think the enemies will better scale to your level, since a level 300 won’t come by and buff them up.
---
Your friends will not be able to use it unless you’re online.
---
So note, if you build a camp on your main character, when you go on the private server, that same camp will be there. It’s not like you can build a whole new, and bigger camp.
---
Eh, with all the insane builds and legacy weapons still floating around, I honestly doubt it. But I'm skeptical.
---
Did u like that 1
---
Well good luck to you, I know how that struggle can be
---
Actually, I like this change a lot.  Bosses/Legendaries should be a challenge to kill.  In events, maybe they should be even stronger than out in the world.
---
If your a girl leave behind a golf ball and microscope for the male players who are donkeys during events, they usually get the message. LoL.
---
It just came back for two weeks like a month ago, you probably won’t see it again for a while.
---
Nothing will stop me, except the glass on my rad suit helmet...
---
Agreed, but nonetheless the PA is made of special alloyed steel as far as I know, And no medieval plate armor can come close to that, so that wouldn’t be logical, just my opinion though.
---
What's the 'rest of the game'? 😅
---
On the official forum it's said to first install the fuse and then use the analyzer.
---
Tse double barrel shotguns are still pretty good against single mobs. Two shots is still enough to kill a glowing one if you have demo expert 5 and shotgunner perks
---
In the daily op the final boss has quite a bit of hp. It’s somewhat similar to the alphas in pharma.
---
God damn that's one buff ass roach lol
---
Seeing this now after a few months feels different. They are really trying to make the game better and I apreciate it.
---
Yep. Also fond of pissing up streem.
---
Remember when people lost their characters from doing the vault raid? Lol not even the worst one lmao, this game has an atrocious history of bugs
---
Same, I missed two days, so I stopped playing. If I can't get the end rewards anyway, why bother. I doubt I'll come back for next season either since I had to find other games.
---
I meant it looks fine to me on 1080 setting in youtube on 3 different devices
---
Do it!
---
When I see the boot lamp: "It's a major award!"
---
Thank you. I can now be exited for this.
---
Probably. The chicken coop and ammo converter can be bought with gold bullion next season if you miss those though. The coop is 750 and the converter was well over a thousand.
---
As long as they still die at a reasonable rate. I don't want to discover overnight that getting to really high level was the worst mistake I could have made in the game.
---
Agree. Having to log in everyday made me not to want to log in at all.
---
I would rather it be weekly myself. I'm trying to complete the season, but logging in and playing EVERY day (or nearly so), is starting to feel more like a chore than fun... which is probably going to lead to me not playing at all before too long.
---
Man, I don't know if I'm going to be able to help.  This sucks.
---
everything is the same, events or whatever.  its acutally better in some respects.  Like weights to turn in for lead will always be there. My advice loot as much as you can because you will be able to keep your scrap box after you cancel your membership.  you just wont be able to add any more scrap to it.  pretty much pick up everything you see.
---
You can buy plans. They're just kinda rare because it was used in a camp budget exploit.
---
Nice! thanks.
---
Same on consoles. My PS4 has an SSD, and I load in before others, but they still kill me every time. An SSD upgrade is not pay-to-win, at least nor for me.
---
It specifically states piercing gaze is always a mutation enimes have
---
No, I don’t remember that one. I never got to do a vault raid though, so I wasn’t running in the right circles to hear it. 
---
Obviously that would be terrible, and more so if it wasn’t addressed.
---
K that does suck but it’s not your fault I’ll see if I can get anyone else to help
---
the same people complaining about the legendary run are also diligently doing their daily chores for score, as I've mentioned before. if the track record tells us anything, it's that Fo76 players are loyal to the game. I mean, what franchise could F up this bad and still retain *paying* players?
---
not to mention the legendary run is just yet another grind in a long list of time gates and artificial limitations put in place by Bethesda. if the limited stash, caps, scrip and gold bullion didn't drive the remaining 30k players away, the score grind won't, either. not all of them, at least.
---
doesn't mean it sits well with those 30k. and speaking of numbers, let's make another thought exercise. let's assume you're right, that there's a sizeable/silent chunk of players who enjoy grinding and the mmo aspect of Fo76.
---
mmo players are usually more vocal by definition. they're familiar with reddit, forums, youtube, etc. they're not 'silent'. so if you were right, those 15% would include a lot of request for more grind.
---
except they don't. these posts are few and far in between. I honestly see more noise from pvpers than mmo fiends like you. and I find that odd considering the sort of person who'd crave more grinding is the sort of hardcore player who's active in online communities.
---
the 'silent' 85% are casual players who, again, by definition, dislike grinding and just play the game, well, casually.
---
but I guess this is just yet another point you'll just conveniently gloss over.
---
in regards to your mobile monetization scheme remarks, I'll just repeat myself: sure it's not as bad as Korean gachas, but it's still disingenuous. and I **really** hope you're just pretending and can actually understand that people don't want to be inconvenienced daily for months, thus Bethesda allows you to buy levels, because they themselves know that inconveniencing players is profitable.
---
Interesting they have a Storefront image for the Enclave Jetpack but we still dont have images for the armor.
---
Like the S2 PA Paint, not really feeling the new PA Model.
---
With One Wasteland helping smooth things out for mixed level groups, they need to remove item levels. Minimum required levels make sense, but things that have multiple level variants should just sync to the appropriate tier based on the player's level like the enemies are now doing.
---
Aslo server hoping works.  It took my friend 20 minutes of server hoping but he was able to complete it. It seems like if someone completed the quest recently on the server it will glitch.
---
It’s been so long since I explored that area but if it’s the cave I’m thinking of you can gain access to it. You will need to hug the cliff side to find a hidden entrance
---
I think it’s covered in foliage and is some ways apart from the point your picture is at
---
could put daily challenges back to earning atoms and increase weekly challenges
---
Go in with a friend is not a plan suitable for a large portion of the Fallout base.
---
I will have to check it out more. I only looked above for an entrance.
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted...
---
I don't know about you, but I can still see the vote buttons on mobile. 
---
As far as PA goes, I'd think they'd have to be like, external modifications, like welded on. Other then that I could see a museum using a knight power armor skin to advertise (like nuka cola and vim).
---
thanks for the quick responses and info
---
Having gotten to do todays op: the current mutation is still a little dodgy.
---
It's Camo Super Mutants. Sometimes they're invisible even when shooting, sometimes they're not invisible at all, and sometimes my Targeting HUD tracks them through their invisibility, though that third point is an issue with Assaultrons too.
---
Flaws aside, Mutations seem like they're going to create some interesting long-term opportunities for weird gameplay, and I really enjoy that.
---
So yeah, something requiring PA or at least a breather? I'd be game to give it a shot.
---
Shotgun
---
Edit: sorry I need to clarify: get the gauss shotgun, especially if you’re a shotgun build. It’s ridiculous. And I love mine. It’s so op I barely use it.  And you can snipe with it and it’s really ammo friendly. I usually only carry about 200 rounds, even for scorched earth. You simply cannot go wrong with the gauss shotgun.
---
The gauss mini is an ammo hog. It’s heavy (unless you get one that 90% reduced weight. The ammo is heavy (although the same as the shotgun). To keep this thing fed you need to carry a lot of cartridges. Like 2,000 ish. I’m sure others will say different. I used mine for about a month before I scripped it. And it was bloody faster fire reduced weight. It is really powerful and a lot of fun, but the retaining ammo for it is a grind in and of itself. Best way to deal with the gauss mini as far as ammo goes is make it prime as you craft a ton more ultracite cartridges than normal. In my opinion: it’s a really really really good gimmick. 
---
Haven’t messed with a plasma caster. Angry turtle did a video on it and it appears to be really powerful, but a little slow. I may be mistaken on that front though. 
---
For anyone else, these are just my opinions.
---
I stand corrected. :)
---
Yeah, I need to start doing that...that shit became monotonous way too quickly to run it as intended.
---
It sounds like you have a large window to simply complete and if you can do it faster you get better rewards- but I agree, it should be something more controllable like 0 deaths is max level, 1 death is 2nd, 3 for 3rd and you fail if you die 4 times
---
Edited, all good about buttons)
---
I'd love to see any new weapons skins for anything that isnt a hunting rifle, handmade, sledgehammer or pump shotgun.  It's like they only know how to make skins for the same weapons over and over.  I don't even use pipe weapons but I hope you get your skins.
---
Pretty sure I stopped by your camp the other day, the GT looks super familiar lol
---
Jeah, I know what you mean. Usually if i get killed in a way that's pretty much impossible I wait until the kill cam goes to this guy.  at the time the hacker has about 14/15 kill and you can see him killing more in unusual ways. That's when I block the hacker. This doesn't mean that you won't be paired with him but about a minute before a match starts I always check all the people that are in the lobby and if the blocked guy is in there I simply quit and re-enter... Maybe that's a longer wait time but better than having a good start or something like that and then get killed by flying fists across the map or guys who can shot a haunting rifle like a assault rifle WITH auto aim :D
---
Its a glitch from the last update.  You either need to server hop to find a server that someone hasnt completed the quest recently on or do it on a private server somehow.  They changed it from 3 to one sample.  Dont worry if you dont get the sample back.
---
Yeah, I went to like 8 known bobblehead locations in game and in private and never did find a bobblehead for yesterdays challenge...  Today, within 15 minutes of playing... bleh.
---
I mean, we’ve already done that with both Meg and Paige.
---
Because there is nothing that add dmg on the secondary slot except +10% aiming but that nothing and FFR is much more enjoyable for most weapons.
---
Entrance is west of your picture, hug the cliff face and you should find it.
---
I'm so happy I didn't actively participate in this first season so I'm not burned out enough to avoid the second! Power Armor Display here I come!
---
How did you guess =)
---
It is a nice central spot when you are new and trying to save money on fast travel =)
---
shotgun. unless you wanna spend a lot of time looking for ammo for the minigun. 
---
it may be a wacky gun which does what it wants a lot of the time but i wouldn't swap it for anything else
---
It's not a chore to simply play the game. If you feel that way, go play something else.
---
Small point, but the stash limit is a server issue, not an artificial one.
---
And finally, you ASSUME the silent majority don't like the grind.
---
I ASSUME the silent majority do. Again, the people don't post often if they like something, only if they don't.
---
Only if it makes the same sound when I pull it out and put it away
---
This was the GLORY DAYS of fo76. With all the bugs back then, whitesprings was the best. No one even dropped on fissure prime back then.
---
I LOLOL'ed  XD
---
Guass minigun chews through ammo and compared to other heavy weapons is not much of a difference from what I can tell. I have every single heavy weapon and their bloodied. 
---
Plasma caster damage wise is great but it’s slow. Better off with Gatling gun. 
---
Gatling plasma is about the same as guass minigun and it’s much easier to get ammo for.
---
The shotgun however is on a different playing field compared to the other shotguns.
---
why don't you just post your GT and let people join and then someone may be more inclined to help you. maybe you could take turns. 
---
just sayin'
---
A whaat
---
The plasma caster is pretty weak imo.  Not really worth the bullion.   My vote is minigun
---
You are correct just found my way in. Thanks. 1600 hours in and I still see new stuff. I love it.
---
It stacks from base damage.  A new reciever will increase the base damage.  5 percent damage increase up to 9 times so 45 percent increase.  you can miss your target but if you hit another target it will reset furious effect.
---
More food for me! Haha!
---
You misunderstand, I want to do the challenges. Its just that I can't put time into a game daily and if I am id rather not have it feel like I'm missing out on challenges. Just give me more weeklys so I can play on my time.
---

---
Was actually just sending this to someone else
---
Well if you or someone else wants to do that then I’ll be more than happy to
---
Mate it's not about the quality. It's your "script". You want to showcase a weapon and don't include the perks,your build and buffs. Half the video is you looking through the pipboy looking for "something". You get it now?
---
If you’re on PS4 I can hook you up
---
I must have it!
---
Could be a grenade launcher. Not the auto grenade. Seen hackers using that weapon to send out a stream of grenades. Super fast fire rate and no reload.
---
Hype
---
Yeah there are some camp items and of course the free atoms that I really want but since I joined fallout 76 late last month I feel forced to play every day  as I do want the rank 100 stuff 
---
Ps.im at rank 41 now is it at all possible for me to get to rank 100 I get like 2 rank ups a day on average
---
Please don’t exit yourself
---
That's a really cool mask, and I'm picky about what I wear.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever seen any legendary enemies at Whitesprings no matter how much I go there. And I started playing this game after the nerf
---
Im pretty whiped from spending the $120 someone get me a double shot of blonde espresso and a bottle of perrier
---
Hope so
---
Yeah they could've a hacked grenade launcher too, who knows
---
Wow, I like it.
---
And the allies
---
Isn't there a handmade skin that looks just like that?
---
Is filling yourself with pipe dreams really working smarter? They're not handing out level 50 characters, it won't happen! I'm sorry, but you've hot to face the facts before you lose yourself in the fiction! C'mon man, get ahold of yourself! 😕😂
---
Gauss shotgun and Plasma caster miss most of the time in vats, the shotguns great when it hits and the plasma caster is okay but a worse version of the gatling gun. Haven't tried the Minigun since it's too ammo costly to bother. You'd do better buying a cheap magic gatling laser for SBQ since it's super cheap to prime.
---
'One Wasteland' sounds great in theory, but it won't accomplish much for high-level players unless most weapons &amp; perks get rebalanced. Right now, even the highest-level variants of ghouls, robots, scorched etc. pose literally no threat to players with complete builds.
---
I know what the magic shotgun is and have two that i use on everything but the SBQ but, what makes a magic gun like the LMG in the video?  I have a Prime Furious, ffr LMG and it does only normal dmg.
---
Bullion?  Unlikely because it would allow people to already start buying out the best stuff as soon as the update drops.  If they do have a similar shop it would make more sense for them to have a unique currency linked to their own daily quests or possibly any new BoS themed events.
---
Well..I do have some stuff I gotta do....give gt and I'll join game
---
Not sure what you’re talking about, is that what typical COD players say to each other? I’ve been playing COD for ages yet have rarely encountered this (PS4). Players do tend to broadcast their favorite ‘music’, but 76 players do the same. I could selectively mute players in COD but I haven’t figured out how to do that in FO yet. So i simply leave the team or fast travel away. 
---
The pvp component in FO76 is a gigantic missed opportunity from a business standpoint, they could have attracted many players of other games but they failed to do so miserably.
---
Libertyprime886
---
were you using a melee weapon with 40% power attack?
---
thanks for advices anyway!
---
Woah...the word with really changed that sentence.  Made me do a double take =)
---
Yeah true. Still they suggest 1 friend for the the top timer.Doesn't seem to be an alarming advice.
---
When they launched raid 94 they stated hard mode was for a team and that turned out to be true.
---
i have a lot of respect for the guys and girls playing instruments when their best friends are turning to ash an gore piles by 40mm grenades and 2mm electromagnetic cartridges
---
I remember this location vividly, simply because I too saw the safe. But i then spent a hour looking for the way in... somehow missing the cave entrance repeatedly xD
---
But I got my pipe revolver and pre-war currency so it was all worth :-)
---
Like I said, I hope it's implemented better, but right now there seems to still be the possibility that there might be unique rewards that can only be obtained from the faster times. If it's just more exp/caps/whatever, I'm fine with that
---
Brother, I think you just thought up a way to make S.o.D even better by having raiders join in with drinking, shooting, trying to survive the hordes.   
---
Maybe the amount of raiders showing up would be linked to your affinity with the raider faction!
---
Just a quick reminder about how TS work now, each bullet do 62.5% of base dmg (125% both) so you gain 25% dmg if you hit your enemy with two bullets but with the lack of accuracy, you gonna miss a lot of bullets so doing less dmg then a non legendary weapon (VATS help a lot for ts weapon, because you always gonna hit with each bullet, same for shotgun or any weapon that spread bullets, laser, plasma etc...).
---
I’m 286.  It’s not very high but not low either. I don’t care if you are alrex and level 2300 or whatever. You don’t need anything in the season.  
---
If you’re tired of logging in just don’t log in. I don’t know whats so hard about it.
---
Serums are the best way.
---
Otherwise, collect and chug dirty water till you get a mutation or die. Then server hop and do it again. You'll end up with 1 random mutation each time.
---
You just don’t get it do you
---
No more using non-bonused off weapons for casual supply runs through the Forest. 
---
I know some people like making the whole map high level enemies for high level players, but I hate it.
---
As in the problem Bethesda addressed in the latest ITV? Most likely.
---
I'm excited for those season 2 camp rewards. I've got a US army themed bar/inn camp that would work perfectly with some of those rewards.
---
I've been playing since it came to game pass. I take my time and root through everything in detail. I try not to miss any detail. It's really amazing what you can find.
---
Ok I get you one sec
---
Yeah I really like that idea and as they said have the daily as a score multiply so 1 whoud be 1.5x 2=2 3=2.5
---
About time we got the Greenhouse/Glass Window walls
---
What's with all the Spade symbols? Does it mean something?
---
Interesting anti-commie "arcade shooter" makes me really want a whole Arcade bundle
---
Does it not add extra perk slots?
---
I don’t get why no one thought arms race meant the arms race of America and Russia like what could it mean
---
***\*Liberty Prime Didn't Like That\****
---
We are? Damn, that's definitely not good. Still, we have to wait and see, maybe they'll add something by the patch release.
---
Lucky hole mine, there’s something awful hidden down there
---
Holy shit.. the rest of this year for fo76 is going to be amazing
---
it is when you have a literal checklist of daily chores instead of just doing whatever you want.
---
maybe you really are that naive, if you actually believe that the stash 'issue' is caused by server limitations. **it's not**.
---
and I see you indeed glossed over my thought exercise. there is no silent majority/minority of people who enjoy grinding because the sort of hardcore mmo fiend who enjoys this type of thing isn't silent by definition. they're active in online communities.
---
there's nothing to assume here. if these people existed, then they'd show in the (sizeable) 5k sample we have here on reddit, in the official forums and youtube. but they don't. the pvp community makes more noise than this fabled 'silent majority' that never once asked for more grind. they don't even reply to posts criticizing the grind, in fact.
---
it's almost as if... they don't exist.
---
Very good chance it will be at the rate Beth's shop is churning out stuff.
---
Still gets monotonous because you need to do launch prep no matter what, but at least it cuts all the other crap before that.  I commend anyone who enjoys running silos, but damn it's the last thing I want to do with my time in the game.

---
Are you in my game and can you message me so I can friend you so I can join the game once I leave
---
I do understand what you're saying, doesn't change anything for me lol  
---
Similar to how you probably feel about what I've been saying
---
I hate it when they Nerf anything! It is like playing Monopoly and someone changes the rules in the middle of the game. It is forbidden for us to cheat but Bethesda Cheats all the time.
---
What do you mean by lucky hole mines? I’ve only been playing for a month and while running out of ammo doesn’t really happen for me I do have to craft some daily. I do have the excavator power armor for the record. I also loot any and everything but I still don’t have crazy stockpiles of ammo like some other people have when I look at their vending machines.
---
It's definitely going in the front window.
---
I’d be down for more points. I think people would still complain and you know it to be true. 
---
- make it so you have to do 90% of dailies and weeklies : complain it takes too long
---
- stack weeklies w/ more score and no dailies : Complain that they can’t finish them. 
---
- make it only require 25% dailies / weeklies : too easy to do , now nothing to play for. 
---
- make it harder : hardcore have the advantage. 
---
I could go on and on. It would never end.
---
I read that wrong
---
Just invite me to your next one guess I got some tricks to show you.
---
i bought the last rank just because. but the grinding wasn‘t hard with the right XP buffs and having 4 lunchboxes active.
---
Some people may still have the cage plans, but you'll likely have to pay a pretty penny to get one.
---
Ok you just except sub par gaming then 👌🏻
---
Which is a shame, as that event was nice as a high level (400+) player to get low level / new players legendary items.
---
Guess that won't be happening any more
---
Cool beans will do
---
Except for raider armor for some reason.
---
Now would be a reeeeaaaally good time to update us on the status of those Fallout 1st benefits they seemingly forgot about. Cause that’s a lot of stuff that most builders don’t currently have room for.
---
Hey can you message me so I can friend you to get back in the game?
---
So why exactly don't we have more people on the reddit then? Maybe they are actually playing and enjoying the game and not whining about it like you? Again, silent majority who aren't complaining. If they were complaining, you'd probably see more than 15% of the people in the forums and reddit.
---
And again, if you can't do the daily of killing a legendary, completing an event or leveling up, then you aren't playing the game. I will restate this.
---
**Playing the game isn't a chore. If you feel simply playing the game at all is a chore, then stop playing, stop complaining and go back to something that you don't feel is a chore**
---
They Ctrl f'd "vend" and plopped whatever they could find in the weekly list. Just further proof they don't actually play, otherwise they'd have known the nuka cola machine doesn't fit at all in a week of player vendor items.
---
I hope we don't so they back off again
---
I dont understand all this people justifying bugshithesda because it’s a business or investor thing. Mother f we not talking about it being a that we are talking about the way the company handle it’s and as a player base you people who play the game there should be a standard of what we should and shouldn’t accept. Not make justification for them. If you think it’s something you should do and you’re not getting paid by bugshithesda then you’re part of the problem. We all know what you’re saying is true because it’s the business for most game companies. But just like other game companies some that aren’t even Triple A companies like this have and are doing it better. The scum that are currently running this game are nothing but trash that doesn’t even play their own game on all its platforms and it’s obvious just by how they do everything and hide shit or even disguise shit.
---
So constantly?
---
Having a blast in NW while I don't enjoy pubg, apex, or fortnite   
---
It's just fun lol, I don't care if it's "subpar" or whatever, if it's fun then it's worth playing and getting good at in my opinion  
---
Feel free to disagree man, I hope you don't think I was trying to argue or anything, I was just trying to help everyone in this topic find less frustrating ways to play the game mode, because there is fun to be had in it
---
It seems like the big BOS doors are for the instanced camps
---
It caps at 15. We can put more point into other special like End Int or Str depend on your build
---
my job takes up a lot of time.  I like this game but can't always play.  
---
When it comes down to it, if I decide to buy the Atoms for all the ranks, then who should care.  I value my time in what I make.  I won't say what I make, but time in Seasons vs. Money spent vs. What I make, I could spend the atoms.  Should it be this way?  Another subject.  But it is, and people shouldn't care.  Spend money how you want if it doesn't hurt you.  If it does, then don't.   That is when it is a problem.  People can only tell you how to have fun when you got a problem (drugs, booze, gambling,  etc...).  You feel confident spending to rank up is a good use of money?  Then do it.  If you are questioning it, then don't.   If it will set you back,  then don't.   Otherwise, your money.
---
I think every station should have one too.
---
Personally I don't want my CAMP attacked by high level creatures.
---
One if the benefits of living in the forest area at level 452 was I didn't have my CAMP trashed all the time by high level mobs- especially given how useless turrets are.
---
for anyone curious about the broken links,  the PTS feedback posts do exist but someone just f'd up the urls somehow.  If you follow the links just replace the 311 in the url with 312.
---
A random low level killed mine and tried to loot it. 🙄
---
I would always use the glass bottles that kinda looked like they were filled with glowing pee, but somehow were really pretty. I was super excited for the firefly jar for the same reason.
---
Nope. Only once you’ve entered one of the 3 bunkers again.
---
share the wealth with some lower levels
---
Updated my post hope it helps
---
Level means nothing. I have done SBQ fights with players less then level 50 playing on an alt that kick butt at the Queen. 
---
Being lower level is not indicative of what a person can do in battle or what they are selling in a vendor, plain and simple
---
And badly nerfed our ability to earn Atoms
---
Guessing that roach consumed a bunch of steroids 🤣
---
I have been buying Serums at WS bunker
---
They should put a global auction house in the whitesprings. It's already a main hub for all the vendors, might as well have a new way to make caps for players.
---
Not beyond the 15 point cap, no.
---
That isn't a bug.  That under armor isn't actual SS under armor, its classified as casual under armor on purpose and uses casual under armor linings.  Otherwise they'd be selling something that can only be bought with bullion.
---
you're not making any sense. this sub isn't just for complaining. it gets post complimenting Bethesda and the game all the time. you're still ignoring the fact that the sort of player who enjoys grinding makes itself known, they're not silent by definition.
---
yet pvpers make more noise than your ilk. what do you think that implies, exactly? vocal players such as mmo-ers would surely be part of the 15% sample found here on reddit, on the official forums or even youtube. because that's how hardcore players are.
---
but they're not. they don't even show up to defend their skinner box addiction like you're doing right now, when people criticize the legendary run or just grinding in general.
---
you're not making any sense. I also never said 'playing the game' is a chore. what I said is that doing my daily chores like a good boy, is a chore. a common complaint is that a lot of people don't play NW, for example.
---
Add

Dr teeth 69r md

And

Doc teeth jr
---
Clearly they also cursed you with an incurable case of salt
---
Even facists need a good baked tato... For morale. I guess.
---
And obviously, how stoned you are
---
It was the place where people would just drop ammo and Legendary Items right in the middle of the floor for anyone to pick up.
---
I don’t think they mind not having the ability to pleasure others ;)
---
They're not changing shit no matter how many upvotes those kinds of threads get.  The whole point of the system is to get people logging in every day to maintain player retention.
---
Quick workaround too is blueprint your vendors and if someone is shopping and you leave they will stay in.
---
Yup i always forget the actual name of their species, but theres a wide variety of them around the world
---
Not sure if you’re specifically looking for something in the middle of the map, or just referencing the lake bed in the somewhat middle area. But the cliffs East/Northeast of Foundation, overlooking Cranberry Bog, have many sizable flat areas, and include a fantastic view. These are actually going to be some of the flattest buildable locations across the whole map. Also, you can check the areas at the bottom of many of the power line towers, as many of them have pretty flat terrain to build on.
---
Picture of a lvl 100 roach:  https://imgur.com/k5ZQZkQ
---
This game is not called "tag all legendaries". No offense but if some legendary is chasing my ass I won't be running around begging people to tag it while it's killing me.
---
If you wait just a few more days there will be pictures o' plenty.
---
Well it’s all fake so like, let’s pump the breaks here.
---
Hi guise what's going on in this here thread?
---
So with the One Wasteland feature what is the  min-max lvl of say , the SBQ or Imposter SheepSquatch? Or the enemies in Project Paradise and the Daily ops? Cuz they say low level characters can join in those events and do relative damage to a high lvl character. What’s the point of giving level recommendations or have “end game” events if at lvl 20 I can do the same damage as a lvl 100? Maybe they said it but I didn’t understand. Just wondering how that would work.
---
Take a hammer and beat on it. My dad used to say it fixes everything.
---
I will say though, i have 12 corn, 8 tato, 6 carrot, 6 gourd, 8 mutfruit, 6 blackberry, and 4 razorgrain planted using 9 of the full sized farmable tiles at my camp. With green thumb equipped i harvest enough that I have more than I need to upkeep my brewer, herbivore, fertilizer, and adhesive.  You can get a lot more out of the tiles than you think originally without using any exploits. Ive also found that if you put mutiple tiles together, you can squeeze more crops in by playing tetris.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Get a lot of charisma and start buying serum plans. They are like 15k+
---
First quest: Deliver some Nuka Cola My Blood's In It to Elder BOSman.
---
Yes that is the Handmades "Communist Style" skin.
---
The MG42 definitely looks like a gun that the Chinese commies would have used against the US. I mean the Chinese used a copy of the Mauser C96 pistol, that they called the Chinese pistol.
---
So i don't think that it would be a big reach for me to say this but, MG42 = Chinese Light Machine gun!
---
Tried that and it didn't work for me
---
I don't agree with making just one daily challenge,  but make it something all your player base can do.  Thats what all successful mobile games do.  Either that or base it on level so longterm players still get a challenge and so do low levels.  Well Mobile games kind of do that.  "Hit X number of raids", well i have a higher raid than a lvl 1.  So it is challenging.
---
No it’s a bug, because it doesn’t use the causal under armor mods, it uses the ss one but doesn’t consume the materials and doesn’t actually upgrade it
---
and yet still more powerful than everything else
---
The only way I could make a pistol viable (and a laser pistol at that) was add a tuned splitter to it to up the fire rate, with an refined automatic beta-wave tuner, a recon scope (because aiming somehow focuses the spread across that whole distance) and to do the ammo glitch when swapping between it and a high-capacity heavy weapon while reloading the pistol after draining it's mag. 
---
Turned it into a face melter I reserve just for griefers (and...maybe panicked moments with Yao guais...) Melts anything in front of it in an instant! Though it breaks fast, about 250 shots in, My own pocket-sized gatling pistol! And now, I can add staggering effects to it? Woooot! Assholes won't even be able to shoot back with so many stagger proc chances being spat out at them.
---
Elaborate?
---
I see a lot of people camped out there too when I’m trying to find the vendor bot ;)
---
the TSE nerf drove a bunch of people away. I really like this game but it gets harder and harder to find reasons to log back in every day.
---
I wish it was a plan and not just part of a costume. I have already go through like billion items to get the item I want.
---
If you're honestly worried about dying to a mole miner then you clearly need the legendary kills... and should be mad as well when people one hit them and you don't get a hit. Also, have fun with the curse.
---
Don’t think bloodied got nerfed, it’s either a bug or they did something with how adrenal reaction, need rage and bloodied interact now
---
Huh, not an armor I noticed was missing
---
Why not?   I was picturing one of the nihilist Germans from the Big Lebowski.    Upset over someone jokingly upset over a video game.
---
Most weapons got damage nerfed it’s not just bloodied. It’s the weapon themselves and or how buffs affect each other.
---
There’s a guy doing a pts video running junkies and his damage is reduced about 30% overall with a handmade.
---
Would be great if they just started by fixing the magic weapon bug. Bloodied build is a high risk/high reward situation. Would be a shame if they ruined that.
---
I should've included "pleasuring themselves" in the post, dammit.
---
I’m just referring to what I don’t want because I’ve been there
---
I assume the One Wasteland feature is the same as in ESO, where the zones lvl with you, so you can never out lvl them and stomp around.
---
Which is fine, I personally would enjoy more the system SWTOR has, where zones have lvl caps, but players are scaled down to max zone lvl and their stats are adjusted to that.
---
It's going to be interesting with scaling.
---
Ol Power Armor Pajamas from FO3..
---
Agree to disagree?
---
If this is true I'm definitely done with 76, all my characters are bloodied builds and purely PVE, my strong yet weak play style doesn't affect anyone else. Is this because of NW?
---
Bethesda better be prepared to haemorrhage players.
---
I have a full set of bolstering wwr SS armor and an arsenal of bloodied weapons. I'm not complaining for myself, just warning the douchebags that their junk won't work anymore and everyone will leave them.
---
Yeah, it’s missing from season 1 and looks like it’s missing from season 2 also. Maybe they forgot Raider armor even exists.
---
Ave, True to Modus.
---
It is the same as another public server - except - you are there alone (or your friends, or group you invite). So, all the progress is yours to keep, however, if you capture workshop and leave for more than like 5 minutes they will be gone and you will have to capture stuff again.  
---
So if you want to build a camp on private, do it, it will be the same as on public when you switch.
---
&gt; I couldn't be more excited for the update to come now! 
---
Why?
---
Their needs to be more builds viable, BRING ON THE NERF HAMMER.
---
That's sick!
---
Fellow stealth sniper/commando build here; can confirm. Patience is the name of the game. I also tend to just hoof it and walk more often than I do fast travel so a huge chunk of my time is spent is spent just walking around the map getting to where I'm going. Especially if I decide to billy goat my way over a mountain range instead of going around.
---
Alright, I definitely suggest checking out the locations I mentioned then, if being near the middle of the map is not something you’re worried about.
---
Or just Scorched wearing different sets of armors.
---
Some wearing combat armors and some wearing Metal armors.
---
I assume the dmg is added additively rather then multiplicative now.
---
I think that was me. I went on a delivery spree last night. First up was the Rusty Pick. Lvl 40 out the front. I had to multi drop bags as the game was being a bit laggy. I find plans. I deliver them to new players along with my own found stuff and bits and pieces like ammo and aid. If this was me then I am glad they found a good home. I just like doing it to make others happy. People did it to me when I started playing. Pass it on when you get higher up. Happy playing.
---
still pretty stupid they're nerfing bloodied builds but is there any news on magic weapons
---
Wonder if this is going to be a nerf to bloooooooodied buildsss
---
I'm excited but also worried about the weight of displayed armor versus just 10 pounds on a frame.
---
Probably.. but I want all the notes you own
---
Yeah I just wondered around there and I saw a pretty flat space thanks for your help
---
Because Bloodied is such a dominant meta that it's a meme.
---
It needs to come down to the level of other gear, and then EVERYTHING needs to be cranked up.
---
Please Bethesda, I don't even play your game, please give me everything without playing because I must have it even though I'll never use it because I don't play.  Also just make me level 1000.
---
More than anything, the damage calculations are probably necessary for the One Wasteland changes, I imagine.
---
Wow i thought i didn't have enough time but I have an entire month man ill be able to finish this easy.
---
Hit rank 80 last night. Pushing to 90 and using the gifted atoms for thr last 10 levels. Cant (and wont) do it again if its daily. Its just taken over what spare time i have. Please let us have a weeks worth of daily score tired to week long objectives so we can play every other day or weekends only?
---
Why not.
---
I'd like a shower too, yeah. but on the other hand, i'm fortunate enough to live on some water, so i can just jump in and rinse off.
---
Was gonna say the same thing, I dont like the bos but their bunkers were stylish
---
Maybe a choice between getting 1 - 3 legendary modules vs. scrip?
---
I’ve been trying for a bloodied gauss and I’ve done it like 30 times already
---
Oh, I always confuse that place with radiation rumble. :'D Nevertheless, not saving any legendaries. If it moves it's dead, especially with my tesla :(.  
---
I give you one advice, join public team. If anyone of the 4 ppl tag the enemy, you all can pick up the loot. Cool huh?
---
But we'll no longer get under leveled legendary loot from the events we run lime radiation rumble or uranium fever. I'm looking forward to it.
---
Oh no.....(does the sarcasm come through?)
---
I kinda need them now tho
---
Well the greenhouse makes me regret getting the greenhouse dome.
---
I fully expect many/most camps to turn into giant power armor display warehouses.
---
Recall cards....did 13 straight Encryptid on Wednesday.
---
They could just make all weapons skinned variants of the Commie Whacker and then give everyone a trophy.
---
I want a *safe space* in Flatwoods with boxes of free stuff.
---
My camp budget is crying
---
That’s a pretty clever way of doing that. Now if they could just fix the ammo converter :)
---
Glass Cavern....enjoy the scenery.
---
Wow i'm not going to lie, but next season for the legendary run already looks better with those rewards
---
When you say a conduit, do you mean the through wall wired type or the regular mounted power connectors?
---
If doing through wall, all power still has to be distributed meaning generator to connector to distribution to connector  to powered device
---
This article was about fo4 but the connector system works the same for conduits in 76
---
https://www.shacknews.com/article/95488/fallout-4-how-to-use-power-conduits-to-power-your-settlement
---
Probably fixing those "magic" weapons
---
Here are some side by sides:

---
Bloodied still isn’t the issue, unyielding is. I don’t even use a bloodied weapon on my bloodied build, i just stealth all over the place and 1-2 shot things with my mutants handmade
---
True story! I have been playing fallout since 1998 and it feels like with Fallout 76 Beth is being very lazy and minimalist. Compared with other Fallout games it like butter scraped over too much bread.
---
Oh... Oh no. Oh no. That bloodied fixer is ruined. No, it is on sale!
---
that's a stupid take on the matter, really. there's no need to ruin a build just so you can buff the rest anyway.
---
I'll also never understand that reasoning. you want a build that outputs high damage? then just play bloodied.
---
Happened to me the other day!
---
HOLY MOTHER THAT OG BOS BUNKER 😍
---
*Cher volume increases*
---
Yeah  37 out of last 53 rolls have been with the Mutant prefix on them....I am not pleased
---
You sir, wins one whole Internetz...
---
in your stash?
---
I crafted over 50 pieces last night. 
---
Zero unyielding.
---
Do it first if you have a problem with it.
---
It'd be nice if the skins worked for every kind of weapon. Like rifle skins could be applied to all the rifles
---
Something that I’m kinda worried about is this power armor display 
---
From the looks of it the frame is the camp item and you place the armor piece on it, and if it’s like a normal display case you’re gonna have all 6 piece just chillin in your stash and they’re heavy
---
It's okay if you're upset that you invested a lot of time getting that gear. I get it.
---
But EVERY weapon in this game should be viable, not 1% of them.
---
That’s nice.
---
My hard drive also crapped out on ps4 pro. Thinking about switching to PC.
---
I know it's literally all rng but make 3 each time pause, check out what you made, and if you didn't get the primary legendary, switch servers. It couldn't hurt to try it.
---
If they don't fix health rubber banding first a lot of their players will quit.
---
Me too.
---
That actually looks pretty snazzy! Definitely a neat reward.
---
Find someone with a "You've been insulted!" note for 30,000 caps and buy it.
---
I hope
---
 you can just go to the final cavern and skip all the waypoints
---
Just a placeable power conduit on a roof. I also directly powered a small size water purifier with a large generator, meaning it had more than enough power, yet it says it isn't powered.
---
I thought there was a time limit before starting another one?
---
I snagged a tech document, haven't seen one out of the Enclave bunker in a while.
---
Ya for some reason Posioners comes up waaay to often on the chests. Ive rolled maybe 10-12 Uny chests and at least 6-7 were uny/poisoner and most just 2*. Feel like too much of a coincidence to not be some bug like the old 50% limb dmg on every melee one.
---
This is an excellent idea...so Bethesda probably won't do it...they want players to farm and grind so they have a greater exposure to their atomic shop.
---
Kinda wonky that one of the hardest shielded plans to get is the on that goes on atom shop items.
---
Not if you hop servers.
---
Where was this?
---
Of course not.  I have accidentally left Super Duper on and had a bunch of food rot.
---
Get good.
---
a lot of weapons are viable, like vampire's. they just don't output high damage, like bloodied.
---
so I'll repeat myself: if you want high damage output, just play bloodied. it's not rocket science.
---
what, you want them to nerf bloodied and buff medic's so they output the same damage? just so you can say you're not playing bloodied? makes no sense.
---
Is that from the PTS? 
---
So i assume this means we won't have Steel Dawn until maybe a week or 2 after Patch 22?
---
That's so obvious, no wonder I didn't think of it.
---
Looks like someone on the development team has been watching Doctor Who.  &gt;!Cybermen!&lt; anyone?
---
From the Colossal Problem event, a new event in the PTS which you start by &gt;!nuking Monogah Mine to fight a new boss.!&lt;
---
There's a mod for that on nexus mods for fallout 4.
---
Have a secondary character for the level up challenges of you are of a high level. Cheers
---
What dialogue options do you have
---
That’s the issue though, some of us can’t weather it be because level or our builds aren’t maximized or like me you are built for something else. Also if you are just farming legendaries why not let more drop and try trading with people to see if they got the drop you want? The more people you let get hits in the higher the chance you’ll get to getting your dream gun.
---
Lol i have a magic minigun so I only really need the lead from my front yard.
---
That set was my favourite building set from FO4 so Im happy as hell to see that back. And free. Lots of creativity to be had with those
---
Because that's the only time my vendors can sell.  I'm often not doing anything even.  Just on so maybe you'll buy something.  I start my own team so you can travel for free and hang out at my base sometimes.  Shrug.
---
Dang that sucks. I just use my husband's character as a mule when I need to swap stuff between characters.
---
I don't know of a dunce hat, but the clown hat and costume in Freddie's House of Fears might do.
---
Fill up your health bar, i swear all i get is unyielding as a full health build.
---
On the cliff above Toxic Larry’s there is a lead deposite and at TL there are 3 snallygasters who drop acid. Won’t be as steady as a ressource nod, but worked for me. Plus great view!
---
Oh really? Do you have a link?
---
Okay but what I'm trying to say is does the same power conduit on the roof that connects to the generator also connect to the item you want powered.
---
Also just check your CAMP device make sure nothing nsays it needs to be repaired
---
Everyone was also duping those days
---
They said they were trying to adjust how the numbers are calculated so they probably broke something
---
In line in the sand I like jumping to reach the same height as the scorch beast before shooting it :) sometimes I can get close enough to rifle bash her
---
Still a lot of skins by the looks but yeah. Seems to have a lot more quality items in between. Hopefully a good step up from the last one
---
Does the head lamp work like the mining helmet?
---
Ouch! Not looking foreword to this grind 😢
---
Getting serious G.I. Joe/ Cobra vibes
---
A power conduit powers everything around it, it doesn't connect to anything. It's an area of electricity. As for the repairs, everything in my camp is fine.
---
Even if you don't get distracted, don't do everything at once.  Servers can crash, system can crash and suddenly need to do an update.....  So many things can possibly go wrong.  Biggest mistake was trying to do everything in one go.
---
Definitely sucks though.
---
I haven’t had that problem, or at least, haven’t noticed having that problem
---
You'd have to tell me to bugger off I see sbq all the time so I'd choose imposter every time
---
Good point, I crafted one at a time and looked with trepidation, but didn't switch servers, I'll try that 👍
---
Not for anything that is meant to be direct wired. Again go review the link I posted it will explain in depth.
---
Never had that happen.  Get bird bones.
---
Good Comparison. Medic's. Haha, funny guy!
---
How about Bloodied, Two Shot, Anti-Armor, Berserker's, Furious, Junkie's, and Mutant's all having the same DPS so long as you spec specifically for a build?
---
How would that kind of balance hurt you? How could it ruin your day?
---
It's possible! I was at an abandoned cabin near Bolton Greens, and recently moved to New Gad.
---
Sure does. Pretty easy for that mutant to spot you when his favorite song is playing from behind a mysterious bush ;).
---
Don't forget to mine the Ultracite!
---
Wow, I'm bloodied, is this game code rng so weighted and obvious? Will try this next time I've enough mats... 
---
I hit 100 the other day legitimately. I think it came out on 6/30, so you can def do it if you try. Took me about 40 days. I was maxing it out with unyielding and buffs running at 40+ intelligence and using cranberry relish with herbivore the whole time. I play about 18-20 hrs a week. If you want to do it you can, but you'll need to focus on it.
---
I tried all the options,I have all the stuff so it’s not super annoying. I was just excited at the 100scrip for the completion because I’ve been using it all on ss gear
---
Yup. That was part of my mistake, "oh, what about that?".
---
Definitely have learned from this.
---
Picked them up
---
Just because you can't play a shitload doesn't mean the people who do should have less content to occupy themselves. 👎
---
and a new thing is sometimes it spawns an entirely new world when you swap chars
---
i lost a LOT of ammo and aid and scrap legendaries. FFS! 
---
just give us an account bank, man
---
So how much do you think you should pay? $130 at the game launch and then another $100 a year for a private World? The point is the system was changed to disadvantage us for the sake of greed.
---
I tried all the dialogue
---
Id prefer better repeatables
---
Clown hat is a good idea, I'll see if one of my characters has one in storage...
---
what's the point of playing with 19% health if two shot, anti armor, berserker's, furious, junkie's and mutant's all have the same dps as bloodied?
---
also if you want to have the same dps as bloodied, then why not play bloodied?
---
This is without a doubt it. Someone on the PTS forum posted saying that a bloody tesla rifle did exactly the same damage as a normal one. That's not a nerf, it's something being completely wrong. Just another thing that's gotten screwed up, but at least it's not on the live servers.
---
S
---
Same here, am curious.
---
Yeah, I was thinking the exact same thing.
---
 I've got too much empty space in mine rn anyway but I'm too much of a coward to change it.
---
Omg please please tell me these are confirmed coming soon and not just in the files 😍 my little heart cant take it if I seen all of that and it'll never be mine 😭
---
The damage buffs are added additively rather then multiplicative now. Bloodied build were the most hit with this. Junkies saw about a 30 to 40 decrease.
---
Edit : please note melee is hit worst of all. Before each str increase was multiplicative now it’s not. Same way with int.
---
Glad to hear you choosed right my bro
---
Ooh that's disappointing
---
Glad to help, and happy building!
---
No it's on the live version. I was just minding my business walking around wotaga and I lost both of the brotherhood stations and then it came back so a gave it a listen and  I noticed that it had less static and you can actually understand half of it. [am on PS4 BTW]
---
I've done everything in the guide. As I said, it worked previously. I changed nothing. I log in today, nothing is working anymore.
---
Aw, man. That sucks. 
---
A bank or separate account wide storage box would be amazing. Wouldn't have to be large, just enough to transfer a few legendaries. Would be fantastic for people without FO1st.
---
I don't. I'm one of those players. The only reason I don't play is due to the lack of grinding. As are many of my friends. We are anticipating the release of the legendary perks cards, but are not active on the game itself. Some are, but most aren't. We're waiting. And we're all subbed to this reddit. I haven't posted anything on this sub other than asking for legendary perks release dates until this post.
---
You keep saying players hop on to compliment, and honestly, that's not my experience with forums and subs. From uneventful and unsuccessful games like anthem, fortnite and vermintide, to highly popular and wildly lucrative games, like RDR2, Overwatch and Warframe, most posts tend to be suggestions to change or improve something, fan art/videos/screen grabs/memes, or conplaints about some aspect of the game. Not a lot of people show up just to post how much they like the game, or compliment some aspect of the systems in place. They do appear on occasion, but it's not often.
---
I just bought another account, cheaper than 1st in the long run since I only care about the scrap box and it's a total of 16200 ish extra storage since I only play one character.
---
Gonna upvote this so people see it. Info I didn’t have. Thanks!
---
The only real complaint I have is the amount of xp needed. Once the world reopens in the After Days, most of us will be back at work and not have time to make it more than halfway realistically.
---
The "play every day/nw" requirements are the cost of doing business.
---
Now factor in the auto completed challenges and it's more frustrating.
---
No no no no. I just got into being a bloodied stealth commando after two years of playing. Don’t nerf the shit. I mean it’s one thing in a pvp environment but not pve
---
Sometimes a tin foil hat that looks like a Hershey's kiss pops in Fort Defiance in one of the shower rooms. That might do too, but it doesn't have the same vibe lol.
---
Its okay, 2 nights ago I was cleaning out my scrap box and I had set 68 stable violet flux and 47 stable cobalt flux on my floor (in a public server) and then I got the "lost connection to server" box and just lost all of my stable flux... ffs thanks a lot internet
---
It could be, but right now people are reporting that Bloodied builds may just be straight up bugged. I'd wait till after the dust settles and we know what's going on before forming an opinion.
---
I'm level 118 and my build is shotgunner/rifleman. I'm casual and have put work into the build, but my gear sucks. I've been unlucky with legendary weapons. I feel like I get a lot of Nocturnals.
---
Did you verify nothing needs to be repaired by hovering over CAMP?
---
B2525 gauss minigun last night was nice but I already had a B2590. Got to test it to see how well 425 ap points work with it.
---
Hate to be the bearer of bad news... Upvote this so people can see and hear. Then they’ll be an uproar if people agree.
---
I run a bloodied build so take this with a grain of salt, I don’t think they should nerf bloodied. But instead start to make perks and stuff around the other prefixes. Causing them to not be as bad and making them more viable
---
Oh. Huh. I can't help, but I wish you the best.
---
 why would there be less?  It can be the same amount total for the week.
---
If it was good, could roll legendaries and such like the fixer
---
Chill the fuck down, Satan
---
Yeah, that occurred to me when they first announced it.   Ask me how glad I am that I've already killed 15K robots (or whatever it was).
---
I just do whatever I feel like man
---
So that’s what does it...... I’ve been wondering what triggers it
---
This sucks. Guess I should get what I can out of it before patch then
---
sigh
---
You're full of it with the "I only have 19% Health" garbage. Give me a break.
---
Like playing an Unyielding Bloodied build doesn't make you near invincible.
---
Yeah, you're in danger if you get attacked by a horde of Feral Ghouls and can't get away, but when you can stand and take attacks from a Deathclaw like it's tickling you, you're not at risk in any way.
---
AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT THEY NEED TO FLESH OUT THOSE EFFECTS SO THEY"RE ON EQUAL FOOTING, BOTH NEGATIVELY AND POSITIVELY.
---
Jesus Christ.  Keep this shit to the official PTS forum.
---
Unless something is in the PTS patch notes treat it as a fucking bug.  They aren't going to just nerf one of the most popular legendary effects in the game without as much as a footnote.  
---
All signs on the PTS right now point to this being a BUG and not an intended interaction and until bethesda confirms it either way you should NOT be rushing here to start a panic about it.
---
Ouch, i crafted 10 pieces yesterday, got two 3* and one 1* unyielding - i'm not even a bloodied build.
---
I wanted Vanguard 😢
---
I didn’t think there was an NDA anymore?
---
You can also hide a mirror ball under the little roof and have disco chickens.
---
Oh I don't need them. This is for the new players who can't one tap everything and actually need the legendaries to make progress. Have fun with the curse, homie.
---
Did you pay your bill?
---
delete this
---
I’ve actually been there recently. Love it! Would make for a great event area or part of a Daily Ops mission
---
Hit up Fort Defiance. That used to be the mental asylum, and now the Brotherhood of Steel took it over. Then they were driven out of Appalachia because they weren’t able to get the resources they needed from the Responders, who couldn’t get their resources from the Free States because of Raiders.
---
love post about people complaining about people complaining.
---
You're the real mvp
---
Pretty sure the board game is supposed to be GI Joe themed
---
💯 percent agreed
---
Incorrect, if I understood this glitch I would happily assist him in doing it.
---
You sacrifice so much for bloodied, it should always be the highest dmg output as all the other can be played at full health, I can see beserkers being right under bloodied if you have like no armor.
---
Me neither, but need to be accepted to continue ;(
---
Oh man, it’s better than season 1.. red shift stuff!
---
They should still show up, but like everything, they don’t always
---
Using diluted radx and radaway doesn't surpress your mutations
---
It's fairly common knowledge now, but I didn't know til recently
---
You can also use normal radx and radaway and then override them with one diluted version to get your mutations back
---
Im a month new to the game and the only place I see groups of players (5+) is at sbq or the more popular events, just got my first assaultron recall card for Encryptid and scared to use it. Should I wait until a server that just finished Scorched Earth and then pop it?
---
When in a terminal and you wish to exit quick....Hold O (on PS4) or what ever the equivalent is and it will exit instead of having to keep backing out through the menus you’ve gone through.
---
Someone has to do the shitty work
---
There's a very large spot just east of site Charlie I think on the cliff over looking the toxic valley. It's south of the Palace of the winding path. Just above the spot is one of the many random spawns when you drink Nuka shine.
---
To be fair, bethesda isnt great at dealing with bugs to begin with. So people being alarmed by this is fair id say.
---
Some people have more free time than money.
---
Some people have more money than free time...
---
They're usually free inside the suitcase at Watoga Station.
---
I typically sell mine for around 100 caps for the armor pieces, then 250ish for the jet pack
---
*that*'s your sample? you and your group of friends? wow. and you said my guesstimates were bad. because clearly your half a dozen sample is reliable enough.
---
no, that doesn't change anything I said. hardcore players are often active in online communities dedicated to their games and there's simply not enough mmo fiends here, on the official forums or youtube to use as evidence to back your claim.
---
&gt;most posts tend to be suggestions to change or improve something, fan art/videos/screen grabs/memes, or conplaints about some aspect of the game.
---
that also doesn't change anything I said. the point is that mmo-ers would make themselves heard if they existed. except they don't.
---
even pvpers do. but not mmo-ers. I wonder what that means.
---
Sure, I just stick them in blue suitcases but 15 caps is plenty fair.
---
I'd go to a private server if I wanted to completely avoid PVP. It's never forced upon you though so I can live with it. 90-95% of the time I don't get challenged for a workshop. I always leave my extractors unlocked, so there's not much in it for anyone to contest--they're getting something just for stopping by.
---
Ppl like you that don't understand why bloodied is the strongest will ruin the game, if that happens good luck at iss and queens.
---
If that’s the case people sure seem to be disclosing a lot today
---
Don't follow or try to fight the Queen in the blast zone as she heals and it makes it a lot harder. Back away into the outer area and motion others to follow. Try to stay on the ground, instead of on a fence or tent, as much as you can too so she is more likely to land.
---
Got mine within 5 tries ,3 star also :) got absolutely nothing decent with the legs though
---
I’m glad this is happening. I’d love some diversity in the builds and not just pure bloodied. It seems like this should match up with the other legendaries now.
---
Odd how you lost both of the Brotherhood stations. 
---
Huh, I'll take a listen once i get on Fallout in awhile. [Xbox One]
---
I've seen her land right beside a tent multiple times too, I think the stagger throws off the landing but there's times I'm hammering her with a 50 cal while running backwards from everyone else and she's locked onto me and lands pretty quick
---
I submitted a ticket due to the fact that friends would get kicked from my private server when entering as a group. 
---
Beth said they are looking into issues of friends not showing properly. Doesn't mean much tbh.
---
Oh I didn't know that one about getting mutations back! Thanks for the tip!
---
There is too many skin for handmade... And even more that coming but we don't have any skin for every weapons, that sick.
---
mine was downloaded from nexus on may 21st. i dont know exactly if there is a newer version.
---
Can confirm. I hopped on an alt, that was stuck on the quest, and went to my private server and was able to complete it.
---
I have a vast array of weapons across various builds, and it's true, it seems TSE does the most damage again.
---
Comrade Commander; Fallout's budget Red Communist Cobra Commander clone.
---
I love it! Shame that the icon looks epic but the actual ingame model leaves a bit to desire. Wish the head gear was more matching to the player icon portrait. Less pronounced ear flaps and the missing red ascents kind of ruin the look.
---
South and west side of the power plant you can usually find bloatflies.
---
Well I mean people have been clamoring for it to be nerfed for so damn long , instead of buffing the other prefixes it finally happened now everyone is crying out in ragequit.   
---
It's not live and maybe if enough pressure is put on the forums they may revert?
---
I sell that for 30 caps or just give it a way
---
Glad to please!
---
Does score earned on the PTS carry over to the live one?
---
I'll keep trying.
---
Yeah I'm hoping to have a very brotherhood CAMP over the next year or so.
---
I thought the Reclamation Day hat was the dunce cap?
---
The first time you run with liberty prime and he talks shit about commies in the fo3 DLC. I remember being like “fuck yeah let’s do this!!”
---
Does he have some port to drink through like Dark Helmet?
---
God no ...what’s the point in builds now do Bethesda just hate us now this feels like a personal attack on my build.
---
I sell any of the jet packs for 100 and they go in bursts, so at 15 they should find their way out the door pretty easily
---
Getting a bunch of level 5s to help me raid a workshop someone was using to abuse the old broken container glitch
---
No, sadly not. I just went a-testin' and we're still only a little above Instigating Rolling Pin tier.
---

---
Shots/testing done with maxed out Stealth Pistoleer build and a AA/Aiming Gauss Pistol. Took 4-5 fully charged shots from stealth to kill a West-Tek mutant.
---
Lower than 15? Lol
---
I’ve been playing this forever and don’t recall ever seeing a miss nanny at the Whitespring. 
---
That said.  One of my best moments was just fast-traveling to Camden Park as I normally do for the tokens. Then this unexpected thing happened. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/hkG1JKh.jpg
---
that's not true at all. I see you're not a bloodied player. a lot of people complaining about bloodied (for whatever reason) never actually played bloodied. and when they do, they realize they have to pick between surviveability through PA or unyielding, because they die so fast to even a group of liberators.
---
but that doesn't really change anything I said. if all those prefixes are just as powerful, then what's the point of bloodied? if I can output the same damage with two shot, then I'll just play at 100% health.
---
I have a recently built machine with m2 nvme ssd, solid gigabit Ethernet to the router, 300/300 fiber internet and friends load in 5s before me. I can only assume it’s also geographical?
---
Amen to that, sick of the freaking dailies. But speaking of big fights, the quick team thing is pretty cool. Hopped on a random team last night and one of the guys messaged me: "wend collus". Of course I knew what he meant, quickly found his location and we took down that big ugly. Most fun I've had in a while; thanks random team guys!
---
It seems like it goes in streaks. If I have to spend more than 5 minutes waiting for something to pop up I just server hop or fire up encrypted if it's available.
---
Same here. Full HP build and 6/10 are unneeded unyielding. 
---
Same at Purveyor. Commando stealth build gets 5/10 heavy weapons, 4/10 melee and 1 other. I think RNG is not so random...
---
I play in 3rd person, and I enjoyed when my head wouldn't load just my body in the red dress and my sunglasses but no head.
---
My least favorite bug is when in PA and my hud loads but my view is black and logging up is the only way to fix.
---
Oh the other day while exiting my pa I could see the inside of my vault girl power armor helmet, that was silly
---
I’ll host a private server on PS4 for anyone who needs to progress.
---
Psn: boredomshaman
---
Are you at max caps? That would make you receive no caps
---
The Season is Called "Armor ACE"
---
Ace can be in reference to Playing Cards, where the Spade is the Primary Suit.
---
weird, I don't know about rad-x, but when I use rad-away diluted it suppresses my mutations, but when I use normal rad-away it doesn't. is this a bug or does what kind of mutations you have matter? asking for a friend.
---
Go to a low level player's camp and buy everything and then drop it all back so they gain the caps and dont loose stick
---
I feel ya-sorry I couldn’t be more help
---
I actually had Ward pull a gun on me.
---
I was talking to him and he said "I see you have our missing property" then pulled a gun on me.
---
After patch 21, there's random enemies that wander into Foundation. Scorced Officer, Cultists, RadStags, etc.
---
When they come in, Ward pulls out a combat rifle.
---
Haha well just so I'm clear, if you lost your mutations then they're gone forever til you use a serum or get lucky from radiation 
---
When I said "get your mutations back" I probably should have said "stop your mutations from being suppressed" haha
---
Players can and have always had the option of playing however they want. Just cause a style is popular doesn't mean there's no diversity.
---
Yea bit odd. Though the brotherhood signal still gives me the chills when  I listen to it.
---
Can't wait until I find something bloodied! Ha!
---
“You know the rules and so do I”
---
Oh yeah that Brotherhood Bunker!
---
Where did they mention that?
---
I usually sell mine for 1 cap to help others and myself with the buy/sell challenges.
---
I mean, I don't HATE them.  It's just, nobody really LIKES canned food.
---
Lately I've noticed radaway stopped surpressing my mutations too actually, but I swear that it did used to surpress them like less than a month ago
---
So I'm not sure it it's a change from a patch or a bug, but yeah at the moment radaway doesn't surpress mutations and radx does
---
I've never noticed diluted radaway surpressing anything tho
---
You on PC?
---
For PC it's pressing Esc instead of tab
---
Wooden blocks have lead, abraxos has acid.   Stock up.
---
The area around The General's Steakhouse is somewhat flat, but there is a higher rate of random visitors in that area too
---
Same health level, mutations, food, chem, etc for both photos?
---
I just finished today . I looked at the last 5 lvls and decided to spend my free 500 atoms to get it over with finally.
---
100% of traffic entered and exited via the Point Pleasant bridge until it collapsed.
---
To my knowledge. This photo was posted in the data mining server.
---
There's a lot i like, the new commie stuff in season 2, mannequins for armor/clothes, and that BoS pre made bunker, but I'm still waiting for the pre made bunker (and wired fences) leaked from update 21 atom shop items to show up...
---
are you by chance a teenager
---
I am using mutations for 2 months I think. And it always surprised me that there are no tips about what suppresses what.
---
Oh no, everything will die in 1 shot instead of... well, it's just still going to die in 1 shot.
---
Maybe their goal isn't just to have people log in daily. Maybe they know that a lot of players have done most everything in the game, and since making new content takes time to complete, they gave us bonus stuff that you'll acquire by just playing a little bit each day. It only feels like a grind if you feel compelled to unlock everything from the pass. The Ally rep grind on the other hand is way too grindy for in-game content.
---
Nope I’m only at 3483c but thanks
---
Ah, got it. Good info regardless, thanks for posting 👍
---
The top comment on this post sums up the change. This didn’t just affect bloody, it affected junkies and others too.
---
We just can leave Nuka-Cola in there before they get there, they'll drink it!... Probably depending on the label you decided on! ;)
---
Shhhhhh...... some really nice pieces in it... i fear i have to grind this season too.... damn you bethesda for knowing how to get us.... :P ;)
---
I won’t disagree, but when 70% of players I see on public teams are all bloodied, I feel as though there’s an issue. And I won’t say there was no diversity, but it seemed as though a large swath of the player base was bloodied in one form or another.
---
I'm not saying this is an accurate review of how many people act like us, I'm simply saying we are an example of the complete opposite you claim everyone is. Only a portion of the gamers who play games actually post online about it in the various forums, subs and social medias. Some games might have higher portions, but still only a portion.
---
This game, if the numbers are to be true, shows that only 15% of the gamers play this AND post here. Roughly.
---
Why would people play games they don't enjoy? That doesn't make ANY sense. I say they do enjoy the game, and appreciate the direction it's going in and just don't feel the need to post about how much they enjoy it due to the fact that they are busy playing it
---
If they fix magic weapons but not rubber banding I'd quit.
---
Holy shit yes. I started playing 76 daily for the legendary run, but I don’t like playing any game daily. I want to have room to play whatever I want
---
If you're traveling to someone's camp that's in savage divide area in the mountains better equip a power armor (even chassis will do), because you might spawn mid air and die, but that doesn't necessarily mean the owner is a griefer, but sometimes it does.
---
It's holding tab for me, escape doesn't do it
---
Why? I hope bloodied builds are nerfed into the ground.
---
Bloodied is nerfed, Valseek is still figuring out if it's intentional or not but my  bloodied fixer only does about 25% more damage compared to when i'm full health, which sucks because now it takes more ammo to kill stuff.
---
Yeah I knew what you meant but always best to clarify 😁
---
That's weird, it does to me and my friends.
---
ALSO as former military and someone who lived in a building in a combat zone that looked just like ft defiance I agree. Always clean wasn't always a thing 🤢
---
The clown hat looks pretty dunce-y especially when wore with normal clothes lol
---
It does block diseases in harsh environments like in the ash heap at least lol
---
Are you appearing offline on Xbox?
---
&gt; I won’t disagree, but when 70% of players I see on public teams are all bloodied, I feel as though there’s an issue. And I won’t say there was no diversity, but it seemed as though a large swath of the player base was bloodied in one form or another.
---
Honest question.  Does this have have as much do with unyielding and the Exp boost?
---
In other words, even if bloodied damage is nerfed;  does not much change?  People are still going to want the 30% exp boost from unyielding gear?  (I had read 2% per level of int)
---
Maximum rare
---
&gt;it’s things you’ll do anyways while playing
---
Ha ha!! Going to a random camp and buying a single bullet three times individually is not something I'd be doing regularly, but sadly, I'm doing it now. I regularly check out vendors anyway, no point in *not* completing that daily but definitely not something I'd do otherwise.
---
are you a virgin
---
You're telling me that some sort of adjustment to the game code couldn't be implemented to fix this?
---
you're arguing that hardcore players, the more active ones in online communities, would have nothing to say about a game they're actively playing because... it's just that good? in a 5k sample out of 30k? which doesn't account for other subs, the official forums, youtube, etc.? no complaints, compliments, jokes, observations, requests, nada? when even pvpers, a micro community within the game have lots to say?
---
wow. are you familiar with the term 'mental gymnastics'? or even occam's razor.
---
That's fair, it does way too much damage currently, even without perks or legendary effects
---
And being abundantly clear on this topic, I do not want to play Caravan.
---
I think if they go through with this idea I will just ignore legendary perks along with all the others :/ I just hope swapping what you already have (without lvling) will remain free. otherwise i call BS.
---
Also if you see a pressure plate outside an entrance, don't assume it's just a quirky entry. Stand on it, wait for the doors to open and inspect the inside before walking in. It took it to happen to me just once and lose all my junk to a griefer to never risk it again. If I spot one myself at a camp I'll try warn people but it's also pretty entertaining to watch those who don't listen get ravaged once the doors close.

Well a face mask won’t protect you from swamp itch, that’s for sure.

NICE
---
Make another character just for the leveling challenge.  
---
Easy breezy.
---
I’ve done that purely by accident in uranium fever.  I spent the rest of the event tagging ads while standing in a corner, occasionally getting  getting shot by this one player. 
---
I now rarely go after legendary enemies in public events if there are a lot of players around.
---
Are you fucking kidding me on the wooden blocks right now?
---
Lol, what happened? I once got lost in someone's camp who built it as a jumping walking puzzle. it's cool but I just wanted to see the shop xD
---
yo got anymore of dem der camp glitches gonna need 'em.   
---
Seriously they need to double the budget post haste with those mannequins and all the other goodies finally my BoS character can display every BoS PA frame (if the budget is there)
---
These moments always remind me of [this](https://youtu.be/tamelQwAKN0) somehow
---
How strange, I use radx diluted because I'm bloodied and it doesn't suppress any of mine. Does the class freak perk impact that I wonder.
---
Don’t have energy to reply more.
---
Nope.   Played for like 9 months before I realized that
---
I agree, some builds are just ridiculously op. Glad it was nerfed!
---
Yes it happened to one of my characters after I applied and then removed the ghillie skin on the chest piece
---
People are suspecting that Bloodied might just be bugged in the test server rn. Don't get outraged just yet
---
I see nothing broken, but how do I check anyways.
---
Low levels:
---
If I do a "give gift" emote, wait a for a god damn minute while I'm in my PipBoy, putting together a care package for you.
---
I got a shit ton of shit and it takes me a minute to go through said shit.
---
Don't run away from me!
---
I walked in, doors closed and fell into a pit of spikes with no exit 😁 bye bye all my junk! I also store it into a stash box as soon as I get the chance just incase.
---
What about Melee? Any info on melee builds? 
---
I’m straight melee cuz making bullets and feeding my guns with bullets make me cringe, it’s too much of a cost.
---
I can't agree enough! I'm there daily using the vendors for various things. What else are caps good for huh? But it's always so dead. I wish I could see another playing crafting ammo or working on power armor and give em a wave. Long gone are those days.
---
Sometimes we are not near the legendary and I can't see or shot through walls
---
There's a really pretty area near the southern border of the map, close to the exact middle, maybe a little to the east 
---
Once you start coming across lakes you're there 
---
Other than some random encounter spawns, I haven't seen any enemies to worry about spawning there, despite it being close to the high level areas like cranberry bog
---
Really nice place to build 
---
If you build too close to the mountains to the north  you may have some enemy spawns tho
---
Either way. I have zero issues with how people want to play. If bloodied is popular so be it. Still takes a good set of armor and the right perks and weapons to be viable. Doesn't affect my gameplay in the slightest.

Not like I am any smarter lol.  "Eh, bloodied fixer...I'll just jam this in that suitcase"

I've never had it go wrong for me but any time I've done it I know I may never see it again.  Sucks if it messes up but life goes on and all that jazz.
---
Ooh, the Giger jetpack
---
Yes, although when I chose to appear online it did not fix it. Also my friend who appears offline has never had this issue and can be seen by everyone he has added. I appear online for friends. He doesn't even do that and has no issues.
---
Your familiar with a vocal minority? You realize, like I said, that not everyone posts about the game all day every day. Until this post, I've lurked this sub for months. Literally just looked at posts, and comments, but never any input. Do you know how many people do that?
---
(Pikachu face)
---
And all the kids toys too
---
Oh yeah this for sure. I was trying to give weapons and ammo to new players and by the time I'd got my inventory loaded and down to the weapon, they had strolled off 😂
---
Thats every grind, once you finish it you have nothing to aim towards. So you've lost your incentive to play. Getting the thing you want in a game sucks compared to chasing after it because you get an item to use on what youve already done 1000 times.
---
If you wear it on your face, sure. You've gotta be creative in the wasteland.
---
Playing a bloodied build is not only about dmg btw.
---
Dude are you seriously complaining about not having 400 plus damage? Jeez...
---
🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ they drop a ton from the scorchbeast queen too, one of her most useless drops imo. You’ll often find them left in the blue suitcase at train station after her fights or free in most vendors. Hell I can give a full set to anyone that needs them on PS4. But you know we all do the hard way first as the information isn’t readily available in game 🥴 hopefully you got a few prime plans in your scorchbeast farm
---
Omg! I feel you. Well as long as there is no flux in it, it's just junk xD
---
mine go on the floor at drop site v9.
---
If you can deal with the ammo usage, the gauss minigun is bad ass. The best thing to do is to switch to a prime receiver as you craft WAY more ammo for the same amount of materials - aside from also needing flux. Make sure and use ammosmith+super duper of course.  You also will want to have 3x batteries included perk card, because otherwise the ammo weighs a ton. As a side benefit your fusion cores and plasma cores weigh 90% less as well.
---
As we level past 50 it's a good idea to keep a Scorched Killer Receiver-equipped weapon around for tagging legendaries without worrying about one-shotting them: they have a low damage output, some give a much higher rate of fire, and the receiver is lighter than anything but a Prime.
---
Hey, I know this might be a lot to ask, but could you fully buff up a tesla rifle and show the loss of damage?
---
Apparently thats been nerfed into the ground aswell,  but its best to just wait and see if its purely just a bug of if bethesda is full blown watering bloodied down.
---
Isn't there a bridge at harpers ferry too?
---
There is only 1 damage perk for unarmed weapons.
---
What kind of logic is that?  
---
People who do this are assholes.  
---
Why should he be an asshole because other people are? 
---
FFS
---
you do realize that you're the exception, not the rule, correct? mmoers, like any hardcore player, are usually active in online communities. except they're nowhere to be seen here, the one place you'd be able to find them. in a sizeable, 15% sample at that.
---
I sure as hell hope not. That would be fucking obnoxious as a melee build.
---
Actually I'm not saying anything other then what I'm come to learn from asking multiple different sources, I'm sure they can remedy it and I'd prefer if they did.
---
I think the mountains where those nodes are look really nice.  I don't bother with vendors.  Scorchbeasts... we'll see.
---
On the PTS my bloodied Fixer does 124 base damage, and on regular servers 275
---
I was talking about rad-away, I don't use rad-x much, but I think if works as you described.
---
Anyone else kill Raider hunters when you see them? Not talking about if its your quest, just out and about running at a target you cant see. I always gun them down in hopes im doing someone a solid in their daily grind for rep haha
---
Nope I have checked and nothing but thanks
---
Well they wouldn't be powerful perks if it was easy to max out all of them......
---
Yes! So aggravating!
---
I don’t run bloodied, makes the game far too easy and boring to one shot everything. 
---
I run instigating, anti armor and executioner melee weapons with vanguard and bolstering armor sets. Just curious if they nerfed any of that.
---
P.S Yes I know it sounds strange for a melee build to not run bloodied at all but I have Carnivore and I farm all melee buff meats to stack melee damage and it does fine. 700-800 damage per reg strikes and 900-1000 on heavy strikes.
---
Oh I wish more people did this. The amount of selfish people in events who man entrances and don't give anybody else the chance to get a legendary is so irritating. I know it's probably an accident majority of the time but surely people know the capability of their weapons before they enter an event. Especially bloodied players.
---
There was a footnote.
---
&gt;Additional Changes
---
Combat
---
&gt;Bonus Damage: We’ve made adjustments to the way damage bonuses are calculated to make the resulting damage from multiple buffs more predictable and allow future improvements.
---
I'm in exactly the same boot - fingers crossed its a bug.
---
I actually jump onto a random roof where I'm sure no one will be likely to find them and drop all my ultracite and jetpack plans. There are way to many of those things in vendors. They're almost as much of a cancer as mounted heads.
---
Related question. Is the only thing I can do with them is drop them if I'm not going to use them? Am I missing a way to scrap them?
---
Whoops I meant rada way! But yeah that is strange.
---
It is pretty frustrating to see, the reason I use a bloodied build is because combat is tedious without it. I recently started using a bloodied build and ever since then I have been enjoying combat a lot more, being a glass cannon is exciting.
---
I die in one hit but that is the price to pay for not having to craft ammo and farm lead constantly.
---
&gt; will always the determining factor   
---
   
---
I guess I misunderstood this then.  
---
Because it wouldn't always be if they fixed their code.
---
I started a new character. My main is a low health stealth commando, while my alt is a high health unarmed tank. I used my main to get all the best gear for the alt when they hit level 50, and now im worried when i do hit level 50 it'll all be over. I have at least left the majority of the main story quests untouched.
---
What’s the point of using Bloodied over Junkies now?
---
It didn't work for me either.
---
blessed are the cheesemakers
---
To be fair, it's really not that high risk at all if you stack your build correctly.
---
But the bears :(
---
Some Explosives require.
---
Hmm. I haven't dropped that yet, maybe I'll just wear that permanently.
---
Scrip, ammo, and keepsakes to spread out across 4 other characters. And also to scrip out all 5 characters for the day.
---
Oh joy another service rifle skin as opposed to actually adding to the game
---
Thx that's better. 
---
I have some magic heavies but none of them work like that on the queen,it's frustrating. One is a minigun,with two shots,limb damage and 200+ fire rate.If that doesn't shoot enough bullets x seconds to crash the system ,i have no clue what else I should do. The only difference is that I use heavy perks 2/2/1 instead of 3/3/3.
---
I absolutely agree but alas in its current state that's the factor in play.
---
don't generalize. the grind for the thing I want is what demoralizes me the most.
---
actually playing with said thing is what I actually enjoy about this game. except the legendary run sucked the life out of me.
---
I am so sorry. That hurt to read.
---
They probably tweaked enemy health and armor too, it's most likely not just to nerf everything but to balance EVERYTHING out
---
Oh right, also robot mini statues :p
---
Because maybe they are playing the game?
---
Someone who enjoys the game has two choices.
---
1. Talk about the game they enjoy.
---
2. Play the game they enjoy.
---
What fucking option so you think they are going to choose?
---
I always hated loading in after friends were already looting.
---
Hey a handmade or fixer and out a powerful automatic receiver on it. I use an explosive handmade with demo expert all commando perks maxed as well as bloody mess and it's list damage is 120 something
---
Legendary effects enhanced by chems, mutations or other damage boosts
---
My bloodied auto handmade will show 500+ damage in the pip boy at times
---
You also need certain mutations you need certain agility perk cards and luck perk cards. I played at beta and just now started to change my way and get bigger then that
---
I've lost so many of them by accidentally scrapping 😭 I managed to get them and they now live in a display case safely tucked away 😌
---
I for one, bow to our new chicken overlords.
---
Sell Radshield, rad ant lager and pepperoni rolls at a reasonable price.   Same for ultracite ammo and stabilized flux.  Ammo at 1 cap each unless it's ultracite.   I'll clean you out.
---
Whitesprings is a fine location.  No need to move.
---
I'm like a mule carrying 50+ rad-aways and 100+ super stimpaks xD if I could turn them all in diluted and sell the rest.. I'd be rich xD
---
Holy Fuck is that a Power Armor display?!?
---
So I had the full 60% boost and a bobble head is another 20%
---
Like what mutations?
---
Yeah, I'll accumulate the scrap again, and might find better legendaries, the plans are still available too, just sucks in the moment.  
---
Sorry about your Fixer though.
---
yes, unless they changed it, you can start a mule character and just scrap all your cards if thats what you want.
---
water is flat. Build on a large pond. There is a big one on the south border about south of the southern watchtower.
---
I just spent about three weeks respeccing my level 200+ pistol user into an unarmed melee badass. It was grueling and frustrating, but finally satisfying to achieve a powerful build, something I have wanted badly since beta. Pistols have really, really sucked the entire game and made me want to quit so many times.
---
It's been a really fun few days--guess I'll go back to being a useless garbage player just in time for everything to be leveled to scale (except probably my turrets and pet) so I can watch my camp get leveled by the AI when someone hangs out at my camp too long.
---
Just a quick side note about repair kits - don’t buy them, no need. Join in on the scorchbeast queen fights when someone activates her. You need to do minor damage to her to gain access to rewards but honestly even if you feel you can’t do much damage - join a public team, get a few hits on her and help with the trash mobs that come to annoy the heavy hitters. All active help no matter how small is hugely welcome, it’s the leaches that we ~~hate~~ dislike. And from that you’ll get free repair kits that are better then the store bought basic ones
---
same! that's why I just go to stash box, gently place precious junk and then scrap the rest xD
---
you're really reaching now. people who enjoy games talk about said games. especially if they're hardcore players, such as mmoers. but that's not the case here, is it. there no mmo fiends around. to complain, to compliment, to joke, nada.
---
you're literally arguing against basic logic at this point.
---
Legendary effects and mutations can have a effect on the damage. They also have probably a prime receiver on their weapons.
---
Its not that there is no diversity, its that there is significantly less when you look at players once they get to the level where they can have a build type of any consequence.  Of course people can play other builds but most won't because its human nature to want to the easy route.  When one build becomes overly dominant its time look at rebalancing them to some degree and that may include reducing the power of the dominant build somewhat.  It should not be a big deal as bloodied will still be better than anything else.
---
Yeah but only a server that has the queen dead quick other wise it will most likely fail
---
I’ll prob spell them wrong but what type build are you? Are you bloodied? That already gives you more damage with the mutation adrenal reaction and other stuff. Look up a video on YouTube angry turtle has really good ones
---
Bloodied is getting nerfed hard. It's still the best overall in damage but yeah, it's getting nerfed.
---
Damn this next season is looking extra noice.
---
THEY BOUGHT IN THE ORIGINAL BUNKER FROM FALLOUT 1! BY GOD I AM HYPED TO BYE THAT
---
Why would someone throw away used toilet paper? I don't know.
---
Site bravo, charlie is the far south one
---
I think it's a train bridge that goes into the mountains
---
It's really not if you don't run meta weapons. Pistols? Laughable before (without a god roll and a skin-of-your-teeth build) but hitting half as hard would be too masochistic even for me to bother continue running them.
---
One wasteland will probably take it down too when every enemy is scaled to your level.
---
I agree, people always say "I love the glass cannon feeling" but when the servers dont work health just shoots back up. Plus I've met so many bloodied builds that just exploit healing salves and it basically makes them invincible. Fucking stupid...
---
Awww but I don’t want to go hunting for lead again
---
Oh no that's a bad idea! Building and crafting takes from your stash, I lost all my bears in one of the fixes because the display cases dropped the items into my stash and I didn't know :(
---
To save items now that I don't wanna display, I have a hidden vendor in my camp and just put them in there for max Caps. That's where my jumbo fuzzies live until they decide we can display them! 😁
---
It is mentioned often, and it's sad there hasn't been a fix yet.
---
PSN Nukapack
---
It’s probably Assassin’s. 
---
Certain second star effects will “override” certain primary effects in the name. I mostly notice it with AP refresh And Poison Resist overriding Assassin’s
---
There's a flat area just to the East of Fissure Site Omega that can easily fit a 7x7 square of foundations. The neighbours are a bit noisy, though
---
You can put multiple fridge
---
Your own camp! Just throw down some water purifiers, add Hard Bargain....profit.
---
What a childish comment.
---
to each their own.
---
You. Are. Scrap. That means. I. Like. You.
---
Bersekers hit at all?
---
Ty
---
Because they are **PLAYING THE GAME**.
---
Again, two choices.
---
1. Talk about game.
---
2. Play game
---
Why do you insist on the idea that people aren't going to play the game they enjoy so they can talk about it instead?
---
My vending machine got reset and everything went to my stash so you should check it
---
Those season pass outfits look clean af
---
And the new power armor is basically the Iron Patriot. Stoked.
---
And last but certainly not least, finally the Marine and Robot armor get actual paint skins (since the Ghille 'paint' doesn't actually paint the armor itself for those 2 types, looking more like taped-on leaves than anything else).
---
They need buffs. Not nerfs. Even mild ones to balance high health builds. Bloodied is popular because the payoff of low health is high damage. High damage means less bullets and wear on weapons. Less wear and ammo spent is less time farming. Which means more time to run around and just play. I ran high health and instigating until I started to farm high level areas and events. So I've seen both sides.
---
The filler might as well be just Lunchboxes...would be happy with that instead.
---
When your power armor becomes one with your body and you just cannot unequip it no matter what.
---
I also really like the special checks in dialogues. Well it's not good old Fallout, but having an option to threaten to beat someone with the bag of their own potatoes demanding all the soup they got is priceless xD
---
We usually just stop everybody at the border and make them carry the car over to the WV side, set it back down and drive on.  If they are desperate enough to drive our roads, we make them earn it  ;-P.
---
Its a PSA, how I feel about it is kinda unrelated. 
---
It doesn't really change melee too much it just hard nerfs ***unarmed*** melee weapons specifically. One handed melee like swords, hatchets, and two hand melee, pole arms, hammers actually remained the same from my understanding. 
---
So melee builds might lean towards power armor now? Talons is also a useless mutation? 
---
Overall not much will be changed unarmed players will switch to 1h, 2h, shotgun, or heavy guns (which most of them swap between already). They still have a lot of options available to them half of which isn't even switching off melee. 
---
Its a bit of an extreme tweek tho which will making things like the bear claw, and any other future unarmed weapon basically unusable but thats it. Mostly I'm giving people a heads up to sell their unarmed stuff now
---
Sell all Ultracite plans for 1 cap each.
---
Bloodied will still be the top damage build.
---
It's been like this for awhile now.
---
You really can't have good rewards every other step.
---
It doesn’t.
---
That would look good with the SS  armor set.
---
Ive only started having this consistently since the last update. I get it every time i open a vendor now
---
There's lots of reports from testers that they're doing 50% less damage now on the pts. The perk card multipliers aren't stacking any more and mutations barely change anything. Lots of mobs have become Bullet sponges cause they're at max level now (100) with tons of hp.
---
Lol. Well I usually display them asap or put on sale before crafting anything. Think they take a lot of space tho. Wish I had the space for all the teddy bears and Mr. fuzzies xD
---
A day doesn't pass in like an hour in real life either.  Time is sped up in-game.
---
I like the adding of light and ultra light to SS armor but I'd really like Headlamps for Combat and Marine Helmets and the Bright headlamps for all regular helmets lights and Excavator, Ultracite and T-65.
---
They would have to put more than a scrap box.  
---
What they need is a system to check out a room, that is an instance allowing players to trade items between characters on the same account.
---
Been a high health build since BETA....you find ways to deal with it.
---
Meta’s change. It’s just a fact of life.
---
Wierd. I haven't been able to inspect anything in a vendor for awhile, not sure how long. I'm on xb1 if that makes a difference.
---
Yeah I think I have all the prime plans now, maybe missing 1 or 2. I got a stack of 500ish ultracite scrap from them too
---
In WoW, my level 70 hunter allowed me to create a DK at 55. Gear was bland of course but learning how to play it for roughly 20 levels was more than enough.  
---
If something a fan suggest is good enough where they listen it's not 'stupid'.
---
That’s so weird. It just randomly showed up for me one day, I don’t even own any of the different skins for any of the armor pieces.
---
because you're arguing that in almost 2 whole years, against all odds, not a single hardcore mmo player, the ones you most commonly find in online communities, showed up to talk about the game in any capacity.
---
I guess they're just **that** invested in Fo76, playing 24/7. the obvious explanation is that they don't exist, but no. let's go with yours, that defy all logic.
---
What location is this? I’ve played since launch and surprised I can’t recognize it
---
From what I know tho,your damage should be irrelevant. In fact I can one shot almost anything with my gauss shotgun without any shotty perk.
---
What a dumb argument. If you don’t like it don’t play it. How some of us choose to play doesn’t affect you in the slightest unless there is PvP involved. And other builds are perfectly capable of one-shorting things and doing good damage as well.
---
FIRST, thanks for sharing the knowledge, KNOWING is half the battle! ;)
---
Secondly.... ...... so... adding a little balance is fine, and i admit that this change is big enough to ruffle some delicate feathers so prepare for the bitchening!  
---
For me personally thought, I play bloodied right now, and for me this is fine.  I will still slay solo, and I already self nerf when i go in a pack because otherwise I'm the cunt who one shots all the enemies!.... so this helps my co-op play... (sorry im an optimist i cant help it...)
---
I do think that in addition to this some of the neglected builds still need a buff... this nerf doesn't quite cut it to make another more viable to me to use primarily.  
---
if you disagree downvote me, argue that im not just a cunt but a stupid one, go cry in a corner somewhere, w/e.
---
there's my 2 cents
---
Athena pretty much always destroys at least one thing in my camp... During her attacking she charges her laser but by the time it's ready the wall goes down and she walks away... I think she could melt my camp with the laZor :D
---
Back to your post:
---
Maybe it's another Athena from another player? I don't know how this works with her.
---
Those were the days!!
---
Nah you did good, you cannot do anything more than what you did
---
Pretty standard for battle pass systems, especially free ones. Actually considering it’s free, it’s a whole lot better than most passes.
---
i get that. i wasn‘t as mad at the caps rewards for example, even tho i really don‘t need caps anymore. but radaways and radx take the cake. everyone tosses these.
---
Those sound useless but still better than repair kits and scrap kits. At least I can sell the chems to a vendor.
---
Just look for leader of the pack, you can get 3 legendaries then do wolf hoard for another legendary and lately it seams collision course has been spawning a legendary in the final wave do you hen get 5 legendaries level 10 or lower in the forest very easily so just find a different way to get your daily and weekly chanlenges completed if your having issues
---
yes, lunchboxes or even ammo would be better. why make a warfare themed season and not reward ammo? it‘s so weird.
---
Magic weapons shall be the new Meta, Rise Heavy gunner comrades.
---
It was odd for sure, and mid conversation she disappeared, with the commander saying "yes, we know what trade is"
---
So I'm just chalking it up to too much Daddy-O and a touch of radiation.
---
People defending one-shotting the lego 
---
Y'all some whole ass Trogs
---
Because Bethesda sucks
---
Thats just being facetious now. I've seen plenty of posts complimenting the game. Just because you ignore them doesn't mean they don't exist.
---
Greenhouse! Finally!
---
Yeah and i HATE that. 
---
Surely there has to be some research to show this is what burns people out no?
---
Its insane, I get such wild burnout from this game because of the need I have to constantly log on EVERYDAY.
---
But that’s the thing. There *is* no alternative to Fallout. Anything else that’s similar feels hollow, fake. I just wish anyone but Bethesda, EA or Rockstar got hold of this and developed it.
---
Nice work! You’ll never have to hunt those mutated bin chickens ever again 🤪
---
My wife is gonna be so happy, she's been trying to make her pistol build work for months
---
SBQ has not been kind to her, bless her heart lmao
---
don't forget to curse a bit, never underestimate the power of swearing
---
Yeah it was a bad night, but I'm already back up to 8 violet, lol the wasteland soldiers on
---
You do realize that there are new people starting the game and are happy to receive free items even if you can find them everywhere? Geez. And it could be placeholders for the PTS. don't expect rewards for lv 300 guys...
---
God I'm so excited to see Bloodied go.
---
Unfortunately this is witch-hunting and will probably be removed.  Report to Bethesda and hope for the best.
---
What if they increase the caps cap? I'd take that over the casino tbh
---
&gt; doing a little less damage won't kill you.
---
actually it might..
---
Fuck! I was hoping season 2 would suck, hopefully it isn't as tedious challenge wise
---
Those rewards are too good to pass up
---
Well I would definetly scrip them instead of dropping them, so at least you get half your scrip back to buy more modules
---
Then have xp. Xp will become the most wanted thing when legendary perks drop. I'd rather have lunch boxes as the other guy suggested or straight up 15k xp,which would still be less than 20% I need to lvl up lol.
---
Good. And I say that as Junkies player who just saw 30% of their effective damage disappear. Looks like the top performers are being reigned in a bit, hopefully we’ll start to see more Instigating and TS being used.
---
are they from mmo players, though? complimenting the grind? or from mmo players, complaining that there isn't enough grinding? what about posts from mmo players requesting more grind? and who can forget the classic posts by mmo players memeing about the grind.
---
except those don't exist. that's my point.
---
I hope they do too, there is no real risk for the reward you get with Bloodied and unyielding
---
you can come to your camp module and if you see an option to press space saying repair all then something is broken, but you might not have materials to repair it tho.
---
Other than duping, it can only be acquired by farming technical documents. It took me a couple of months to get it. And once you learn it, it never drops for you again.
---
And some crops. Slap on green thumb and you can get the 1400 daily caps with ease.
---
I once saw a youtube vid that showed, if you nuke the town of Monongha, you could get ghoul spawn almost as good as White Springs.  Is that still possible? If it is, I'm sitting on 6 nuke key cards and I'm ready to start dropping!
---
Where is it going?
---
[Getting creative is how I got swamp itch.](https://i.imgur.com/0Q9flNn.png)
---
I'd be happy if they just end season 1 right now and start this
---
If she needs pointers i can help. I got 750+ hours as a pistol main.
---
screw the BoS.
---
What if I cry...from joy? Lol
---
We've got about 3 to 4 weeks left so to save some money just grind it passivly till there's like a day left
---
A good point. I hit 200 of each way too much. I don't even think low level players need these items either. Caps would be at least more useful
---
I agree (or at least update the loading screen that states - every train station has a minimum of 1 stashbox and vendor - lies!🥴🥴🤣)
---
Not a bad shout actually. Maybe a future addition!
---
If it wasn't for this subreddit, I'd never know that standing on tents/fences makes her stay in the sky. And then when you think about it, not everyone that plays is on this subreddit. I'm sure majority of the people that play casually or *are actually* on the tents are completely unaware of it
---
To the same level as other gear.
---
I just got a quick question if I decide to get the munitions plant in my camp will I get in trouble if so I won’t
---
I hope that power armor display is a low level reward. Thats what the community has wanted a long time. 
---
Anyway, looove the fusbal table and the other arcade type machine, they look awesome.
---
I sell all my plans except actual rare ones for 1c, however most people sell at cost or half cost.
---
*Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River...*
---
If they loved the glass canon feeling they would play berserker. Its about doing god like damage with little downside.
---
Yeah makes sense hopefully it won't be bad when it releases.
---
Explain to me how you tell an mmo players from another player.
---
Can I vaccinate them with bullets? I'd like to vaccinate the heck out of them with bullets.
---
Why all the hate for bloodied?  It’s just another play style.  That’s the beauty of Fallout - pave your own path and have fun with it.
---
I did that, the whole lot went to the machine, that at least was useful.
---
So its still the lead build for damage then.
---
yes, i do realize that bethesda lately exclusively caters to new players (except legendary perks), that‘s no secret anymore. doesn‘t mean i like it. just stating my opinion.
---
Worked fine for me yesterday. 1 blood sample, t fuse, done deal
---
I think they just changed the quest to no longer need 3 samples and moved the t fuse closer. Old guides that don't reflect the change are wrong.
---
Green thumb is for harvesting more plants, not crafting food.  Super helpful when farming flux.
---
I like to just shoot them in the foot or something so as not to melt them.
---
Think you have it backards it was addictive, now its multiplitive just like armor m pen and % damage reduction.  Additive gives you nuch more.
---
I normally wouldn't care but it's so erroneously unbalanced and most I bump into one shot everything at events.
---
I had a fight yesterday with a camp like that and thought it was an absolutely brilliant idea. I kept walking backwards off of it, but that was entirely on me. 
---
It could've even been your camp
---
Lol, I just did the same post
---
I... I just bought the greenhouse :(
---
Hopefully they expand the camp budget
---
The rewards look great, but the filler is worse. Didn't think they could make the filler worse but they did. 
---
Health kit bundle
---
Rad kit bundle
---
Nukashine
---
Nuclear keycards.
---
/sigh
---
i use a 3 \* Handmande  with 25% faster Fire, Quad Ammo (70 clip),  +25% Scorched (great for Queen). PLus Commando+++, Plus Mutey Abilities, Plus msv crit luck perks, Then the Strange in Numbers, and other shred perks, oh, then I primed it :) ... pretty much shreds anything .
---
Moral of the story and the answer to your question... Yup, auto-rifles can do a lot of damage :)  I personally prefer them over heavies, due to the faster reaction times (no spin)... and yup, I do it drug free
---
Yeah.  Rule 9.
---
Finally! Power armour displays! YES!!!
---
So Bethesda, what about the players that have spent hours and dozens of levels to actually be a bloodied build. They are now shafted are they? Great thanks. Good incentive to keep playing your game.
---
when you'v been playing a high health build that hits pretty hard but not brokenly hard as bloodied or junkies and see a huge nerf to how damage amplifiers stacking has been nerfed.
---

bloodied build lets you melt any enemy before they get the chance to get close to you but it also means you’ll die quickly
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Ok cool, thanks. I’ll let them take it down and then go from there
---
That makes me happy. I avoid due to overload of scrip, this will make me go more
---
they talk about how they enjoy the mmo aspect of the game, such as the grind? they also defend their skinner box, just like you're doing, whenever someone criticizes things like time gates and the legendary run.
---
except that doesn't happen. to be completely honest, it does. every now and then we get someone who actually plays Fo76 for the mmo aspect. but they're far and few in between, even less than pvpers which are already a tiny microcosmos of the community.

PS4

Ugh god I would kill to have a scrap box there, I love going and getting scrap there but it’s such a pain in the butt to walk the golf course looking for a spot to place my tent. Then when I finally do usually a scorchbeast shows up to annoy me trying to put things away.
---
I really enjoyed the post that someone made about how they had been "trained" and "mentally conditioned" to log in every day and do their dailies.
---
Like, its a fucking game, mate. This is a personal issue, not a Bethesda one.
---
That is some discriminatory shit right there.
---
Can't wait to see that large greenhouse outfitted with vending machines, neon lights and shit-loads of banners like a shopping mall.
---
This will come right back on their forehead if they overdo it.
---
What is even the point,if the only melee recently added is unarmed(gauntlet).
---
Yeah, I have this issue and I just got the same email earlier today. I was in excavator armor when I went in there to turn in the blood and the fuse. So I did both successfully, analyzed successfully, but then when I needed to get into the machine to scan me I couldn't because I was in power armor. And then I had the great you cannot exit your power armor here bug. So I fast travel away, still couldn't exit power armor, fast travel to an event, still couldn't exit my power armor. Logged off and back in which did allow me to get out of power armor but apparently the game checkpoints you putting the blood into be analysed but doesn't checkpoint actually analyzing the sample. 
---
So now I have no blood sample but the only option is to analyze the blood sample. And when I try it says there's no blood sample to analyze. Nice catch 22.
---
I hope my 20 strength isn’t hurt that much... Cause that would really, really suck. I’m not even bloodied FFS.
---
Understandable, Im kinda in the same point
---
After seeing this I logged off, have no desire to play anymore. Been building my stash boxes for two characters for 100’s of hours towards junkies and bloodied, never complained on reddit about this game before but my will to continue playing is gone
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
You should be able to get about 90-100 without legendary versions of the handmade and fixer. Powerful automatic receiver or primed automatic receiver, all 3 commando cards at 3 star, bloody mess at 3 star. To go beyond that, you can get the adrenal reaction mutation which increases damage as your health decreases and the nerd rage perk which boosts damage and damage resist below 20% health. People stack these with bloodied legendary weapons to get really high damage output.
---
Wrong. Here’s an example. You have 3 perks all giving 20% increase in damage. 
---
If it was multiplicative it would be 100% to 120% to 144% to 172.8%
---
Addictive would be 120% 140% then 160%. Big difference.
---
If you mean like all the steps of the quest itself then no. If you mean a mini-quest that starts inside the silo, then yes. It's been a while for me, but last few times I did it it always showed up.
---
Man thanks for sharing and sorry that happened.🍺
---
&gt; a wacky gun which does what it wants a lot of the time
---
Could you elaborate on this please?  Are there some quirks that I should be aware of?
---
Bloodied is still going to be really strong with all of the synergies, if all buffs are now additive instead of multiplicative it's gonna be a damage nerf across the board for everyone.
---
Huh? What’s that? It’s time to rebuild my camp again because Bethesda added more things I desperately wanted? Well, I mean I guess.
---
I cross posted this to facebook to share and now I'm getting hate messages
---
My finger is hovering over the uninstall button till we see what actually happens with the Bloodied Nerf then.
---
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch, young one.
---
But now instead of multiplying the percentage increases, it will add them. So 100 damage with a 20% buff and a 30% buff goes from 156 to 150. Not a big difference. But, for example, when you have 8 different things that buffs damage (20%, 20%, 20%, 15% from perk cards, 50% from junkies or furious, 20% 20% from food, 25% drugs. Base 100 damage would go from (536 damage-multiplying the percentages, to 290 adding the percentages). It makes a big difference when you have many things that stack.
---
I try my best not to one shot  but if there is assholes jumping in front of me with my heavy expo weapons then I clear it all no fucks given.
---
Literally posted last comment and went back to console to see an encryptid event, failed cause only 5 people showed up
---
I supposed logic can be discriminatory, yes. there are virtually no mmo players here, period. if you were right, there definitely would be more and they'd make themselves heard. because that's the nature of hardcore players.
---
is this still obtainable?  I need a new purpose :)  I finish the season this weekend. I would love to hunt/grind for that.  I just looked it up.  I LIKE it :)
---
They can't kill you if they can't see you
---
Mostly
---
Swap servers...
---
So they’ve not nerfed bloodied. They’ve nerfed high damage across all builds?
---
Current metas are basically stealth and/or bloodied.  Csnt be killed if you cant be seen and cant be killed if everything else is dead first.
---
Yup. So far now that I’ve got a full set of 3-star unyielding I rarely if ever use power armor. 
---
I use it occasionally went fighting the Queen, but that’s rare.  I use excavator when mining, of course.
---
Unbalanced is incorrect, thats implying that there are a number of viable builds, which in reality there is not.
---
I laughed hard
---
Suuuuucks, haha
---
I appreciate it, thanks!🤙🏻
---
I wish they'd move every month and fix something new.  Maybe rotate a bit?  Meh, devs won't care.
---
Its not bloodied, its adrenal reaction that might be bugged, at least from what I've read, or maybe nerd rage. These typically get associated with bloodied but I assume you use them with your build since you had low health/high rads.
---
Here here! Take my upvote good sir!!
---
I still one shot things without bloodied lol
---
Well that’s just shitty then. Why are they robbing the fun out of this game? That was my last straw, melee build. If it can’t be functional then it’s not fun anymore to me.
---
So garbage builds for everyone? That sounds like a great idea.
---
2x acrobats armor. Live it, love it
---
Next time try throwing up a post on the Xbox LFG (looking for group). You can find it at the bottom of the 'People' section. I've joined a few Colossus battles that way.
---
Ohhhhh boy actual rewards that aren’t plans?!
---
I'm fresh out of cork due to me dropping it any time I get any.
---
I used to run real low on caps because I was constantly buying ammo. Eventually I started using melee weapons more, this saved my caps used for ammo purchases which is 99% of my cap spending. Eventually I started hoarding ammo and sold them at my camp. Ammo sells quick, event at 1 cap per round, you end up making thousands.
---
never have i ever wanted to be a commie so bad
---
3 builds people use bloodied junkie berserker that’s it
---
Same here I did two events where that happened and I was so confused.
