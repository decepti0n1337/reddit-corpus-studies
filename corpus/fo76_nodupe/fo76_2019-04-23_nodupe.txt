'Reward' : you lose all xp farmed on said ghouls &gt;:3

I've not been able to get into West Tek on my own all week. Every time I go there, some yahoo with a bloodied one shot melee build hops in and start one-shotting the legendaries. Dude or Dudette in question, I am totally cool with letting you get your smack in, just don't stand between me and it long enough for one minigun round to make it through if you arrive and I am already there.
---
You \*could\* go that route if you really wanted and make 90% of your 76 experience swapping cards around, but anyone with even the slightest taste for convenience realizes specializing isn't a bad thing. I have that same crafting spec build and you're right, any other player could technically match most of my ability level just by swapping Intelligence cards every time he's at a crafting bench, but I have yet to come across someone that actually does that.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Virtually every player I've met can either craft their own shit or is content to survive on pickups and gifts. I've heard many a low level player bitch about wanting better armor, but most of them will either suck it up or craft it themselves. If they choose the latter, they'll become a crafting spec like us, craft so-so gear without fully utilizing perks like Weapon Artisan  to maximize their gains, or that one dude will be the crazy guy that gets his SPECIALs up just enough that he can keep the perks on at the same time to accomplish that maximized effect. That would take what, 5 Int for maxed Gunsmith, but come to think of it, I guess you don't need Gunsmith and any Science perk concurrently do you? I swear in Fallout 4 that was a thing. I guess you were right about that hyopthetical crazy person pulling it off with only 5 Int.
---
The brotherhood are pansies and enclave is extinct. Gotta love it.
---
Unless they had repaired it by the time you reached their camp. Any camps within the blast zone are subject to be leveled.
---
I've got plenty, 150 caps a piece if you're cool with that.
---
Psn: Alluminati1ftw
---
Sadly I've having some problems even accessing the main menu successfully. It's working on my administrator account but not my main one, my father is attempting to fix the problem.
---
I thought about that. Maybe next time.
---
My advice is to not start any quests or visit Mire/Cranberry Bog until level 50 or until you can clear Grafton Dam, Steel Yard, and Penitentiary only using melee (no ammo). 
---
For my second character, until I reached level 50, I avoided all quests, Mire and Cranberry Bog. It was a grind to reach 50 and got a little boring (hence the challenge to kill shit without using ammo), but now I am having a blast, completing the main and side quests (with appropriate weapons, armor, perks, mutations,etc). I only use my PA to fast travel when over encumbered or to jump off a cliff. I've gotten a few legendary weapons but sell any that do not fit my current build. No 3 stars yet, no TSE.
---
My character is a commando mix of 1h melee and auto rifle. I use a serrated combat knife and Blade of Bastet (with eye of ra, 100% armor penetration).
---
I have a level 50 perfect storm, level 30 fixer and a level 50 assault rifle (all mods for damage, armor pen, etc). I rotate between the three depending upon ammo and condition situation. I have plans for the handmade rifle and currently visit Berkeley Springs for the handmade spawn, which I scrap to learn mods.
---
I am level 67, still without an All Rise, excavator/x01/ultracite PA. I am saving that for later, perhaps combined with a character respec (unarmed melee &amp; heavy gun). Just about to start the Enclave quests, after I fully explore the Mire.
---
By the time I respec my character, I will have a good mix of perk cards to swap around. Lot easier at level 120 than 50.
---
Don't PvP much (my record us 4-1) but saving lots of stealth boys, chems, magazines.
---
I took this approach after rushing my first character and decided to thoroughly explore the game.
---
Yeah sometimes it looks like snow and I get excited! Like are they testing something for the Nuclear Winter DLC or is shit just f’ed up
---
It’s also way more professional and organized. Must post what platform you are on, for one.
---
I wish it popped up for 2/3 stars only. No one cares about a 1* after like lvl 25
---
Check the chat volume in sound options. The game has a habit of resetting it to 0.
---
Try using the social menu to mute them and then un-mute them.
---
Yes, it doesn't stack as well as it used to, but it's still a noticible buff, if you are using melee weapons you'll also want Twisted Muscles, and Talons if unarmed melee! But Adrenal reaction does effect every weapon you own!
---
Could either have been someone who joined the server after the nuke hit or someone who had a friend on the server, left before the impact, and then used their friend to rejoin after the impact. 
---
Your camp only gets destroyed if its in the initial blast.
---
Be happy you got a drill... She used to disappear completly and you'd get nada damn thing.
---
Probably doesn't even have 5K caps.
---
Better go Roadhouse on them

---
I see.
---
Tried that to no avail unfortunately. Never once saw it move anyhow.
---
Indeed!
---
Yeah, something like boxing ammo. It could be a good way to use cloth, too (in the same way that plastic is used to bulk resources).
---
Gotcha
---
Stupid chat volume probably reset itself to 0 like it loves to do.  Sigh.
---
It was probably nuked hours ago before you even joined the server. Sometimes the leftovers from a Nuke carry on for hours and hours.
---
He about the marine armor helmet too
---
I just met different people on reddit and met more people through them.
---
Agreed
---
Check your crafting menu under headgear.
---
The reduction of hp is unnoticeable if you're making the most of this mutation by having low hp most of the time anyway!
---
Walkthrough please? I only found 1/3.   Forgot what it was though. Been searching everywhere for over 30 minutes
---
Thanks for that info
---
I guess thats true... Looks like Ill give it a shot tonigt.
---
Same, your supposed to get some kinda head, I have all 6 and got nothing
---
Pansies? To be fair if the free states hadn’t of literally waited for the BOS to die and help control the scorched in the mire instead of bunkering down, and the BOS could have been more accepting towards the fire breathers and responders, the scorched would not be half the issue they are.
---
All good here, thanks for the caps!
---
He's got 6 stars
---
a datamining friend confirmed it on discord that the serum recipes are no longer on her lootlist since P8. The question is if it was intentional or unintentional.   
---
there has been a recurring issue with patches in the game where unintended changes somehow slip in, like the adrenal reaction "bug", radworms, bobbypins, a few bugs being un-fixed (Heart of the swarm starting to have the same bug that was fixed in P3/P4 if i recall it right) just to name a few.
---
*shrugs* I guess I'm a hypothetical crazy person. That said, my build is entirely spec'ed around agility, perception, and luck, for sweet, sweet DPS...
---
Unlocks under headwear in armor workbench. Easter Bunny Mascot.
---
Dude it’s fallout shit has always been weird, there’s been a bloke with make believe weapons, aliens, crazy hillbilly swamp people, guns with brains and talking death claws. The weirdness is fine and adds a nice parody to the wasteland
---
It depends. What region are they
---
You good dude?
---
Gettin all worked up over a game.
---
At worst you become a bit of a glass cannon, but as long as you fire/swing/stab/punch first, you win! It works well with stealth perks so you can guarantee you get the first hit in!
---
I’m not surprised, you’re terrible at what you call “testing” and since you don’t even have any multiplicative damage boosts, how can you even test the difference lmao.
---
Multiplicative means each additive bonus will provide whatever % the multiplicative bonus is, on top of what it already adds. So if you have slugger 1 you get 10% damage, if you have bloody mess, slugger 1 gives you 11.5% dmg, plus you get 15% more base damage from bloody mess.
---
So let’s recap:
---
Slugger 1 only, damage boost = 10%
---
Bloody mess rank 3 only, damage boost = 15%
---
Slugger 1 + bloody mess 3, damage boost=26.5%
---
See how that works? It’s really not that hard to understand man, basic, basic, math.
---
Go to the desktop site (old.reddit.com/r/fo76 is easiest) and scroll through the right-hand panel until you find the options to find and edit the flair, Brotherhood will be under there somewhere.
---
I share your frustration in how stupid the system for changing your SPECIAL layout is, but I can't say I'm as cynical about the ordeal as a whole. I swear  more than half this sub is constantly lampooning microtransaction tropes and catastrophizing about how pay-to-win is right around the corner.
---
To clarify, I'm not mad at you or anything like that. I'm just kinda bewildered at what it must be like to be part of that "faction." It must be emotionally exhausting to be so pessimistic so often. I don't get it; I don't think I could live that way. Don't get me wrong, I've got my own problems but trying to find the silver lining in everything and seeing a future beyond setbacks is how I'm still alive.
---
A lot of times this happens because a high level recently visited the are, so the Cell scaled enemies to max level.  Then you came along.  I agree, this was a constant frustration for me @ mid level too, the rewards were NOT worth the resource expenditure.  This is a big flaw in FO76 game design, but I dunno how to fix it outside of level segregated servers.
---
Your best options are server hopping, or I would put that quest 'on hold' and do a different side quest for awhile.  Come back the next day, or see if the Cell had reset by the time I finished.
---
Good luck!
---
Soda Fountain at Whitesprings will always have at least one Nuka Dark for sale.
---
I would pay 5 human real life dollars for an ACOG or red dot.
---
Absolutely
---
Finally! I am running out of space to store mods!
---
Ugh… they have to realize that’s not the target market.
---
Lmao how am I supposed to know that
---
I was just shootin an offer my dude.
---
It's almost entirely unusable if you're using chameleon, which sucks because it's the most stealthy and fun weapon to use.
---
Jaysus, I'm glad I'm not that cynical.
---
Like mine did.
---
Where is this legendary soda fountain.
---
No but they turn into meat piles almost instantly. Just proves that Bethesda screwed with the internal clock, and it's the reason why food is spoiling super fast.
---
It’s never been there when I’ve gone. Maybe I’m just unlucky
---
Could try deleting the preference files, but not sure it'd do anything.
---
Weird, wonder if it’s a server glitch or something.  I don’t think this person could see me at all.  I followed him through Whitespring which was cleared out and kept checking my map to see if he showed and nothing.
---
A note on this, this would allow things like the repair kits to be in the Atomic shop with out being "pay to win" how they could work is the standard kits can be bought for caps at at lets say 1,000 each or their equivalent in Atoms.   
---
With the emphasis on doing the challenges it would be an easier pill to swallow, and with the ability to use an amount of caps it makes it something that you can choose how you get, do you use your hard earned atoms on the kit, or grind up 1,000 caps for the same thing.
---
Right wing of the main floor, past the bar. It's manned by a Ms. Nanny.
---
Robots in Watoga do it pretty often, sometimes they just all drop as soon as I see them, kinda annoying now that theirs no legendaries there and all I want is there sweet delicious aluminium anyway
---
Did you do the 6 unmarked sheepsquantch quests to get the mountable owlet, wendigo, yua guai (sp), and the mystery meat pie? Or the Nuka Quantum paint? Those can take a bit of time
---
I just want any sight aperture at all, so that I can use it while in chameleon.
---
I’ve been to whitesprings a hundred times and I’ve only killed 7 of those golfers for some reason.
---
Not sure what I’ve been doing, but i always get two. It’s always shortly after I killed the initial deathclaw  and properly looting the decaying bodies,  another one pops up as long as I stay within the radius of their spawn point. So if you linger, another one will spawn.
---
Rubberduckie91, did you &amp; i meet again in the uranium fever event a couple of nights ago?
---
i'm confused about my game name, i thought it was GhostRider but my account name is dewoley.
---
[removed]
---
Upper… yes, I look badass.  
---
Lower… yeah, I’m not trying to wear spandex.
---
The comment that you linked made it very clear that Slugger is multiplicative...
---
Yeah, that math is correct, what does that have to do with what I said? Stop changing the subject, fucking pathetic loser.
---
You claimed that multiplicatively, +50% and +15% make +57.5%, which isn't true. ItbExplain how you got that then.
---
Therefore, multiplicative damage boosts are better than additive. Since we establish that Slugger, Iron Fist, and Talons are all multiplicative, +20% • 3 is better than +20% • +25%.
---
The proper way is to set aside a character whom doesn't join the Brotherhood of Steel, but does join the Enclave, then use them for espionage in the military wing to farm for technical data, passing it on to a friend whom is in the Brotherhood!
---
Same here friend. Tried of insane prices too. Hope legendary vendor isn't a huge disappointment.
---
Where is it?
---
Yes. And once when using my scope found a ghoul, squatting and pinching a loaf.
---
Ive never been able to hear other players voicechat too.. Ive tried all of the things people suggest whenever this thread comes up.. all to no avail.. Ive just given up on hever hearing voice chat at this point..
---
I've *always* seen one for sale. I even bought one there just a minute ago.
---
Yessss
---
Dude same, even with mods it's not the same since her dialogue is so little. I need more of her sass
---
Did you try shooting him?
---
Ok sorry im just seeing if your offer is worth it
---
No one knows until we get official info from Bethesda.
---
I wish the Fatman was more like it was in 3. Incredibly powerful but obscenely hard to come by
---
I think pacify effects it.
---
My bad I was thinking about the bar on the upper floor, not the soda fountain. Gonna check that out later tonight
---
Thanks, I expected some sort of event
---
if it does that's pretty dumb then
---
All I know is it's a token system, but you probably already know that too
---
I wanted to make sure it wasn't just my internet cause I live in a town that only has 500 people and crappy internet I mean like there are often days I wont be able to play 76 I still think it could have something to do with lagg cause it happens very often to me
---
For lead, make your Excavator PA and go to the Lucky Hole mine. Grab up the lead ore. Then you can farm industrial/commercial areas for antifreeze and other acid items to smelt it, or make a camp on an acid hole for extraction (or take the one golf-course workshop north west of Grafton for a bit). Same applies to most metals. For steel, I run the Big Bend Tunnel and scrap all the weapons I get from the scorched inside, or kill super muties somewhere for the same (although that takes more ammo).
---
I’m in the same boat.. and the prices fluctuate so much and the market still hasn’t recovered since everything got duped to oblivion a while back lol
---
Agreed! This could really hurt the market, but that market doesn’t really have anything to do with the game itself. Let’s see what happens! Might farm legendaries again to gain these legendary ‘tokens’ for a re-roll. Oh so many ideas for what this new vendor can do.
---
Assuming you're not going for the Bloodied meta, this is what I learned on my second character.
---
Make sure you have Bloody Mess, Tenderizer, and Adrenaline. If you don't have the points to spare, even just 1 rank of Tenderizer and Adrenaline work wonders.
---
Accuracy or Volume, choose according to your play style and circumstance. I have a Big Guns character, and I generally use a Gatling Gun for anything humanoid sized because I can aim it well enough to hit every shot. Anything larger, or when facing a line of targets (like a pile of ghouls running at me), I pop out the minigun. For large groups (like the swarms of bots from Encryptid), I have a pre-patch scatter barrel explosive plasma gatling that turns from here |---------| to here into a zone of death. Before that, I had a sniper character that did well with a lever action for sniping and a handmade for when the target is close enough for repeated headshots.
---
Unfortunately, the weapon makes a difference as well. I have Furious on my Gat and Mini, mostly because I didn't see huge gains using AA on the Mini and have yet to find an AA Gat. If you're on PC, let me know what you use for weapons, and I can check what I have in my "Eventually going to the Legendary Vendor" pile.
---
Yeah happens in the silos all the time where random turrets just explode.  I've had it happen in white spring nuke zone too.
---
Fast traveled to the point, climbed up the rocks, and there was nothing there expect broken Fasnacht balloons. I could still hear a person running around, though.
---
Can you use ultracite ammo with a regular receiver or do you need a prime receiver?
---
I didn't even know you could sort it by spoil. Actually fucking forgot you could sort it at all.
---
I decided early on I would only use weapons/armor I found in game. I'm not optimized in any shape or fashion, but it's slot more challenging.
---
Bloodied melee builds are very good at dropping it's health!
---
Yeah, it’s out of control. The duping has made everything go nuts. Hope this vendor helps!!
---
Apply updates = Patch (server or client, who knows?)
---
Nvm, codes changed on me
---
I use the barbed harpoons
---
Truth hurts sometimes bud
---
Happens to me as well. Annoying when i line up the perfect headshot througg my scope and they die right before i pull the trigger. Makes matters worse since no loot
---
Has anyone else found a wedding ring? It seems really weird that they add in these pieces for no real reason, that can barely or not at all be seen.
---
I did not. I just did the fight itself. I'll check those out, but again that's one and done I'm assuming?
---
That’s an awesome perspective! I still wouldn’t have killed a SBQ with the only weapons I found. Best was a two shot rapid fire Gatling run...but I’m a rifle build...lol
---
Imagine a massive Honeybeast Raid boss that shits out Cazadores
---
Been rocking the enclave officer uniform with the skull Halloween mask for a while. Depending on if I walk or hop around, I can belong to both
---
How bout no?
---
I just want some good looking paint for my X-01 power armor &gt;\_&gt;
---
I haven't been motivated to make an alt yet besides i finally got x01 calibrated shocks a couple of weeks ago so anything seems possible now.lol
---
server hop. they appear regularly
---
Scrub 5, standing by
---
Those photos are great. They both have a good feel to them even though very different. 
---
When I'd first started playing I made my camp at Whitesprings... A friend and I were standing in my CAMP, and he'd just gone AFK to get some water or something. The alert went off about the drop..and I was like..well..might wanna hurry back? I started backing away and finally just went outside the blast radius and watched my house and friend get destroyed through my scope. xD
---
Switch, maybe, but it's not a wild west of skill builds if you're talking immediate changes. I could use the points I've got into Perception to change from automatic to semi-automatic rifles, which in terms of specialization are essentially sister builds. Or I could swap most or all of my strength points from carry weight into melee perks, which would be a fairly dramatic shift, but melee builds often require a healthy amount of Endurance speccing, which I've done jackshit for. Since the game favors power armor-melee builds, I've got plenty of perks for smithing my power armor but no plans and no perks for actually using it. So I'd be running around stabbing people with my little combat knife and chugging chems and stimpacks to stay alive. The only kind of build change that is is a half-assed one guaranteed to make the game less fun.
---
TL:DR you \*can\* change builds, but only between builds that share the same SPECIAL anchors, e.g. melee to shotguns, or semi-auto to full auto rifles. Which I feel is fair. It's not pigeonholing us into hyper-specialized builds but not allowing complete reworks at the drop of a hat either.
---
huh. i guess i could deal with losing 23 bullets for THAT amount of xp.
---
Oh my weapons straight up suck compared to every one else's, but it feels more realistic to cobble together crap over time until finally you're only slightly/mostly behind everyone else.
---
I didn’t even think about it honestly.  Not really into pvp  I guess.  I just didn’t know if it was some new setting or something.  Wish I had screenshot it as well.
---
I'm lv 73 and still havent beat her
---
Watoga has some legendarys. A nuke onto the burrows is super good
---
i was treking my way up a mountain and saw 4 radstags fall from the air and die, then some super mutants that must have been chasing them doing the same thing, and surviving, barely.. easy pickings, and i was low on food at the time
---
Nooo!!
---
They all had a heart attack
---
Yup, made it all the way to launch only to realize it's Monday lol
---
Not just exit game to dashboard but completely close down the game ("close application" on PS4)? If so then idk, might be a glitch.
---
Two part entryway stairs added. Can only be attached to roof.
---
Hey shit lips check my most popular post and read up
---
I know the holo's tell stories.  There are a bunch of them, too.  I feel like I need a detective's storyboard with pictures and a spiderweb of yarn to make them all connect.  If I could make the connections, then I'd like them much more.  As they are, there are so many, and since I find them out of order, they just seem like a mishmash of one-shot episodes that I cant buy into.  Maybe on the next runthrough I'll go old school and pull out the ol Pen n Paper. ;)
---
Nice!! I was beginning to think they didn't spawn at the Enclave anymore.
---
I know I'm excited to tell these people asking for 100k in trades for a set of armor to shove it. I like the market but cant stand looking for something and finding it only to see "trades only." I get it it's rare but damn, want to take my whole inventory of weapons. I'm also worried Bethesda will screw it up too. Like only being able to roll all stars on a weapon instead of specific effects.
---
hey it's a bunny mask you can craft it from your armour bench dude
---
Why do so many people on reddit forget how to use google???
---
You mean the restaurant area?
---
It’s a bunny mascot head. It’s in the build menu on the armor workbench.
---
I have a lvl 45 explosive Executioner but the dmg is so low I've never used it
---
I've seen my fair share of level 250+ players, and either they pissed their levels away changing SPECIALs or I swear they've got damn near every level of every perk that's worth any attention. Probably some ignored ones here and there, but all levels of damage perks like Gunslinger and Rifleman would have to have been unlocked by that point.
---
I think it's like 60 dmg with the crystalize barrel
---
Handmade, combat, assault, laser, Tesla, and radium cam all be made auto. Commando cards work with it.
---
Well youtube says a bug about the pacify robot perk and animal friend works on boss type units as well.
---

---
9mm and then release the Maria skin for it in the Atomic shop. I would be very happy.
---
5 characters holding caps and probably 700 hours in game
---
:(
---
I am a bit miffed. I played every single day, and collected my egg.  
---
Then log on today and there is no final "sixth" egg.  
---
Yes, I have logged out and back in, and checked the shop. There is no mention of it anymore, and the shop shows that I only have 5 of the 6.  
---
Am a bit miffed at the moment, since I put in the little effort or play and make sure to check the shop for the newest one.  
---
And we all know the support people aren't going to do anything to help. /sigh
---
Put on an automatic reciever if you have. You'd use Commando perks to increase its damage. Rifleman perks won't affect its damage anymore if you make it automatic.
---
Well I kinda need the decontamination shower plans
---
Ah, no idea then, sorry. I've had a similar issue but every time I've checked and sure enough the chat volume's reset.
---
LOVE remote play! I get kicked off the 70" TV in the evening and simply move to my desk and complete my runs while watching TV with the family.
---
It's perfect for a game like this.
---
You missed the egg by 30mins literally. That was the cut off. Up for 24hrs until 8PM EDT. That sucks. Sorry you missed it :(
---
Super awesome perspective! I think that is what the new PvP seasons are going to be like. So much more realistic
---
I had someone similar but their level and everything was visible I tried to trade didn't even aknowledge my existence
---
I guess your right. It's just tiresome. I am not really sure Bethesda cares.
---
If it wasn't for the jaggy shadow, that pic would be incredibly photorealistic.
---
You need prime
---
I come across him like slender 8 pages.
---
I have had the cursor jump around on me as well when scrapping it's really important to pay attention to where that thing goes sometimes it jumps way up sometimes it goes way down not sure what's happening but it does make scrapping a little bit tedious.
---
They talked about the possibilities of seasons at the last conference they had, so we'll see how that works out. Factions are definitely a huge thing that should be added to Survival. Its pretty much the reason I made a Brotherhood guy and a raider guy who only uses raider/trapper armor. 
---
I'm all for starting over with a new character and disabling legendaries, but it'd probably have to be done in some hardcore survival mode. So people could still have the option to use legendaries in the base mode. 
---
The weapon balancing is the biggest change I'd like for the mode right now. Even with non legendaries, I've seen level 15 players 1-2 shot level 100s with automatic rifles in sneak mode. I've even gotten 1 shot by a level 2 player using a level 1 pipe revolver while I was level 15. Its ridiculous at all levels, even without legendaries. 
---
2nd thing would be PvP based events in the world. Mostly this would give people a place to fight while giving them a free nearby spawn after dying (in different spots of course). This could easily be done with hunter hunted. Just make hunter hunted an event in some town like Harpers Ferry or Huntersville. People join it, last man standing wins. You leave the event area, and you're kicked out of the event. Stuff like that would motivate me to play Survival more than just getting the legendary and waiting for the next week.
---
Deletes stash.
---
Bad comparison, but I noticed that if you buy the clone trooper skin packs in SWBF2 it says you get a refund for each skin in the pack you already have, the amount equal to the actual cost of the skin itself. I guess the connection I'm seeing is that either getting duplicates of perks you already have (exluding lower levels of perks like OP is talking about) being impossible, like dupes of lockpicking ranks, or that you'd get some kind of rebate for said dupes. What that payout would be, I have no clue what would be fair. Caps or atoms would cause overlap in normally isolated loops of the game's economy, which wouldn't make sense.
---
Yeah, but seeing as they have 40+ mountables I bet they keep stealth adding more.
---
Thanks I’ll try them out
---
What actually is planned for the patch tomorrow?
---
Like, not sarcastically speaking.
---
Yeah hate the trade only offers. I’m like...WOW, that’s the weapon I want!...oh only trading for assassin sentinel ap refresh heavy combat left leg. Oh yeah, let me just take that out of my stash and trade it.LOL...
---
I’m also worried that Bethesda will screw it up just like you said. I do understand that it can’t be THAT easy or everyone will have almost the same armor, but I’m getting tired of grinding and reading trade posts. I just want to enjoy this game
---
And the item was freakin cool as. Love the missing ear personally. I've always preferred things to have 'character' ❤️
---
How do you farm it if robots are neutral?
---
3 nukes while I played on X-BOX today in 3 different servers on a 4 hour period,
---
You're right about Player interaction.  If I want to play with someone I have to server hop until I see people at an event and go there.  Tip: Don't do that for the Asylum because 100% of the time they're actually inside NOT doing the event.
---
All they have to do is have the events is give a good reward.  It's a very very simple fix and people would do them all the time.  It's why half the server at least did Fasnacht when it was up and Sheepsquatch, those had good rewards.  Eventually a way to group up other than randomly inviting people on your server, such as player made quests/events people can join or faction based quests that put all people of a certain faction in a group with or without pvp involved.
---
Eventually there should be a token system implimented and a way to actually purchase the exact weapon/armor you want if this Legendary Vendor doesn't allow you to do that.  Theres no reason why dupers and a minority of lucky players/good traders can go around with god tier everything while regular players are stuck with a 30% increased diarrhea while overencumbered.

This goes even deeper into weapon imbalance in general.  at least 30% if not 60% of affixes are useless.  It's already bad when it's 1 star, and it's hard enough to get a 2 or 3 star, there should at least be ample "good" weapons so even if you get something you may not use it's still good for someone.  
---
I'd say roughtly 85% of my drops are trash, 10% are good for someone else, 5% are good for me.
---
tl;dr Player interaction is easily solved by better Event rewards like Sheepsquatch and Fasnacht
---
Don’t sleep on the BOS officer uniform with BoS combat armor on top
---
Fk!
---
Not skins for the atom shop, like unique skins only for that weapon
---
Yeah I would spend so much on the mask oh my god
---
Deletes tokens/vendor to free up space...
---
however you can use regular ammo in an ultracite weapon that hasnt been modded prime.
---
Same. But outfits make it cool too!
---
I’m guessing it’s coming tomorrow with the Camera patch.
---
Hey totally welcome. Sorry for late response. Reddit never showed me your comment -_-
---
He spawns near the overseers camp quite frequently. Just try getting the civil war reenactor and he's a gaurenteed spawn because you're not looking for him.
---
Also check out New Gad he spawns near to the FT point you can see him from it. Though it's a popular camp area.
---
I always thought it was just my character's killer looks.
---
Yeah I'm sad to say I've spend the better part of a night looking for trades and trading, while not even getting to run and kill stuff. Sad but true. Got a whole month longer to wait and see what Bethesda has come up with though. May 23, marked my calendar already. Just waiting for the delayed release date now. Lmao.
---
So, what you're basically saying is "i dont like the way the story is being told."
---
I mean, okay. I disagree, but i wont argue. I like the way it's being told and respect you're different opinion.
---
But i do have to mention that complaining about the "gross" holotapes is weird to me, considering we have seen and even done worse in Fallout games, both 76 and past ones.
---
Leads to your armor table haha
---
West Tek
---
Camera added and mods not attaching fix is all I'm sure on.
---
my dude, i'm ps4 so i cant help, but you could literally 1 shot everything with adrenal and sneak with just a plain instigating lever. i'm looking for a bloodied lever bc my bloodied handmade cant even come close to that instigating lever.
---
Yes and no I mean how many death claws can stay on that island
---
I'm assuming he's beibg sarcastic, knowing full well that your reply is the bottomline.
---
There’s a way to glitch through Seneca Rocks and build your camp under the mountain and therefore only be accessible via fast travel. It means he’s a cheating coward lol.
---
Bro, just asking but do you get anything precious from digging up treasures? I never felt so lucky about it.
---
Thanks I’ll also be checking out west tek soon
---
Jesus took their souls.
---
Ahh it's the same guy I encounter the other day they have have stealth boys for days and just stay invisible the whole time with a death claw fist weapon.
---
I've got a rough two story tavern and dining area set up at the moment, if you're on xbox I'll shoot you an invite to check it out tommorow
---
Yeah this guy had zero info displayed and never appeared on the map.  Strange.
---
I've had a 4 story camp, but I built down instead of up, over the edge of a cliff!
---
I mean mascot heads 25 years after an apocalypse probably wont be in the best condition.
---
Honestly, not holding my breath on any "fixes" given the past record of Bugthesda.
---
Honestly i just want an aknowledgement.
---
"Yeah, we screwed up and didnt remove the camera related challenges despite pushing the camera back. We are sorry." That's all. Just say you're aware of it, and that it was a mistake. I dont need any "apology atoms" or whatever. I just want to know that THEY know what's up.
---
But I havent seen anything from bethesda adressing it.
---
It costs a few cloth to make but the "plam" is there
---
I've seen lvl 9 and 22 quite a bit lately. Along with nothing but level 1 eyebots. And today I got a spawn of level 38 and 50 protectrons during a fading rad zone.
---
If you server hop enough *trying* to level there, you will get crap spawns that are worthless for xp.
---
I havent really. Ive just heard of people getting gatling lasers and stuff.
---
You dont need to build the eggs, just get them from the atom shop.
---
I got all 6 but havent placed them cuz i have no concrete. Still unlocked the mask
---
Go on....
---
I ignore people a lot, people like to follow or harass me for my gamer tag
---
Maybe they don't. But eventually, they will.
---
I will pay 10k to anyone that gets me into their game for the day
---
I have over 10k shotgun shells
---
Idk what you expect from raiders ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
i could have sworn they nerfed watoga robot legendary spawns.
---
Shutters
---
Kill them?
---
use gun. shooting them makes them hostile, but only the one you hit
---
As someone who frequently is at work by 8AM and still at work at 8PM, I missed two eggs :( 
---
I really wish Bethesda would consider a midnight cutoff.
---
Idk. Havent gone there for a while
---
Dont forget the raider boss wearing a beard mascot head because he went crazy (from rabies o think) and thought it was a real beast so he wears it like a trophy
---
To be honest going forward I think they oughta start blending the two. Slapping more traditional Fallout-y bits onto goofier outfits. Imagine a Raider gang only wearing beat up mascot outfits with like metal armor bits stuck to it. Like The Pack but furrier.
---
Yup and Halloween has costumes.
---
This is super cool - thanks for sharing. (I’m kinda tempted to build in a nuke zone just for the experience now!)
---
Yep. Especially once we max any card perk out, we should be able to choose how many stars at any given time to select. Whether that one, two, three, four or five.
---
If I farmed up something super awesome, why wouldn't I want to only trade it for something AS super awesome ? Also the drops lately have been INSANE.  I've gotten 3 sent armors , and two exp guns in the last 2 days.
---
Looks pretty heavy to me
---
Yeah one month...let’s just say 2 so we don’t get our hopes up ;)
---
Can’t place your power armor anymore, only drop it. Also if it’s dropped, you can’t get in it anymore. 
---
Bulked items will now get totally deleted when you scrap all, not just broken down. 
---
Purified water no longer does anything. 
---
Can’t launch nukes. 
---
Mods work again, but can’t be put in your stash. 
---
Rad away now weighs 10lbs each
---
Decon showers don’t work anymore
---
Can only form teams of two. If a third joins, the game freezes.
---
I have a lemonade and hard lemonade recipe for 500 each. GT Dookieinyourhat. Will be on in about 2 hours
---
😆👍
---
I do agree, the drops have been a LOT better
---
I really like that vintage football mask and the skull mask. The football one kinda looks like a raw meat helmet
---
This gave me a good chuckle. Thank you.
---
Put the legendaries in the ground, add fertilizer, water them occasionally...
---
damn, I keep hearing this is happening. Now I'm afraid to even launch the game, would really suck to lose some of my favorite legendary weapons or armors.
---
When I discovered it early on, that was my exact reaction.
---
If you are on xbone I'll give those shells a good home
---
I think a free filter or emote would be in good fun. Because while giving atoms might be a stretch, a free new emote/filter could serve as a “I messed up” and be useful in the camera update. Of course nothing will probably be done but I can hope.
---
You don’t listen at all so I don’t know why I keep trying to explain it, but here goes again.
---
The comment I linked made it very clear that general damage bonus effects such as adrenal reaction and bloody mess and talons are all multiplicative damage boosts, they only stack additively together, they are multiplicative with all of the additive damage bonus effects such as the slugger card or iron fist.
---
Again your math is wrong because you are adding the whole twice, why would you include the base damage twice? Full stacked adrenal being multiplicatively added with bloody mess would look like (.50*15)+1.5=1.575, a 57.5% increase and the 100% being the base damage of the weapon. But currently since they are both multiplicative bonuses they are factored together additively, which is simply .5+.15=.65, a 65% dmg increase.
---
I THINK, but am not sure, that this happens when another player has recently been through an area, spawned enemies outside your leveled range (too low or high), left the loaded area, the game says "Nope, that isn't right." and auto-kills them. It's so you don't run into lvl 68 super mutants at lvl 1 in most places, and no lvl 1 enemies at over 100 in higher-level-range areas. Rather annoying sometimes, and immersion-breaking, but it can keep you from getting fucked by too-tough enemies at lower levels and wasting bullets on trash at higher levels.

No worries, I still enjoy playing and helping folks when I can.
---
Just an observation, I think this game is a great bellwether test for folks personalities.
---
If you’re a kind and considerate person IRL, you probably will be in game as well.
---
Should be like 3 where you could stumble upon them or select it as a rare quest reward. I remember getting them and being crazy excited.
---
Been avoiding camp quest for awhile.

They broke mods last patch. Tomorrow's is SUPPOSED to fix it...

I have screen captured about an hours worth of video of me fighting and killing invisible enemies a boatload of times. Usually at WS.

Going to eventually edit it all together in a very much overdone “Funny Moments in Fallout 76” video. Because I’m original.

[The more the better](https://imgur.com/VpaRlM7)

They aren’t as hard as you may think. Totally doable if you’re a smart solo-er. Might be like some events that scale crazy in terms of spawns when you get a few more folks.
---
Thanks but I’m pc.. no worries the grind continues..
---
Haha wish that was a hidden option
---
On pc sorry..
---
I see. ty for your reply!
---
I just realised it’s now like impossible for there to be legendaries in watoga
---
It's when you post. People at that time viciously down vote seemingly without reason.
---
Glad to see this is getting some traction. Absolutely agree with you.
---
I attempted to launch my first nuke from Silo Charlie yesterday, but when I got to the Nuke Prep part the server crashed and I raged quit when I realized I had to go through all that B.S again.
---
Last few I’ve done I’ve either been on my cryolator character (and alternated between freezing her and putting prime gatling rounds into her) or my melee (and waiting for her to land then pound on here while someone else froze her).
---
She’s a pile of HP. As long as she sticks to script, she’s not the problem - it’s the wild adds like Mirelurk Queens, etc. that come in and can wreck you if (a) you aren’t paying attention and (b) no one else is either ;-)
---
I think it worked.
---
My GT is in the Post
---
Just google them dude
---
But you're not to old to make a post saying you are leaving.  :D
---
PS4, but that sounds cool 👍
---
That sounds weirdly plausible.
---
The pacify part, I mean.
---
That's not mulitplicatively applying. You're multiplying the 2 boosts together then for some reason applying it to the boost of Adrenal Reaction. So why do that? Why not do (.5•.15)+1.15? What you're trying to claim relies on one effect being the one applied to for some reason. 
---
You called them multiplicative then said there applied additively... in the same sentence. 😂 what
---
No boost in the game works like that. Every single boost is multiplicative, otherwise damage reduction armor would make you invincible with a few pieces of Assassin's Sentinel's/Cavalier's, because if additive, a full set would give -150% damage taken.
---
Multiplicative would mean 172.5% of damage, because that's what multiplicative means. Adrenal reaction multiplies base damage by 1.5, then Bloody Mess multiplies that by 1.15.
---
Additive would mean 165% damage, which is like you said.
---
This is probably true, but I would encourage solo players to give it a go!
---
Yes, your first 2 or 3 times will be fairly slow as you learn the layout, where to go, poke around the place, and things like that. You will only get faster at it. There is some decent scrap to be had there. The most frustrating part, if I were to guess, would be finding 15 cores while enemies regularly spawn in. BUT! You will come out with 15 broken cores that have no weight and can be repaired at your own workbench for use next time if you want to skip the searching part.
---
Ammo is always a concern, and you can use up a lot of it in the silo. I would suggest having a melee weapon, even if you're not spec'd into it. You will have an opportunity close to the end to repair your gear and create ammo (at the search for cores part). Also, you don't have to kill everything, only whatever gets in your way.
---
Having said that, my bloodied stealth melee build can sneak through the entire place in 25 minutes. Add a couple of minutes if the turrets don't all explode. For a first timer, solo, it will take about an hour, then tack on 30 minutes for the SBQ. Time commitment? Yes, but as I mentioned, you will only get faster at it.
---
At some point, new/solo players will have to step up and run the silos or else there will be no more nukes.
---
Thanks guys!
---
Look up nukacrypt
---
Bloody molerats would wreck them if the state of my crops are anything to go by.
---
I’ve played over 100 hours and I’ve only seen radscorpions spawned by the SBQ 🤨
---
I haven't been able to find them yet either.  They just reset 2hrs ago
---
They should have at least three, two high levels and a lower level to indicate an offspring. Something more than one.
---
Seems legit. But you forget the parts that bullets break weapons in 5 shots and can't be repaired, plus sneak attacks can't happen because enemies always see you even in chameleon.
---
I like to theorize that they’ll add back in some of the lamer legendary effects that were removed from fallout 4. (Ex.+25rad Damage) and these will be purchased with tokens gotten by scrapping legendary stars.
---
Does blocking have that effect.
---
I never liked putting an outfit covering over underarmor and armor pieces. So I took some time to gather paired legendary armor pieces to make my character look decent. Heavy armors look too bulky, I mostly prefer sturdy ones.
---
I mean do legendaries still spawn if they are in neutral mode?
---
Is this just for Grognaks axe or all melee? I haven't noticed it and I have 3 one handed weapons that are all over 100% but I haven't had to repair my weapons for a while, at least since just around the first Sheepsquatch release
---
If they aren’t on nukacrypt they haven’t been cracked yet. I’ve seen it take up to 4 days for the 3rd code to be cracked. I’d expect latest tomorrow for the first code
---
Don't defame six year olds like that.
---
To make some corn dough (tortillas) Lyme is added to water to cook the corn in an alkaline solution , I’m assuming this is close to that lol
---
I’ve played hundreds of hours of crossout, have an epic with hovers - never spent a dime. I spent $60 x2 on fallout76.
---
Free2Play =\= Fee2Play. And even then 1 thing being worst does not actually make another thing better. 
---
And crossout is at least a fully functional, well balanced game that isn’t full of bugs.
---
Not just me that has this ongoing molerat infestation then aha
---
Does the cryogenic effect reduce defenses?
---
I’ve been playing fallout for like, almost 25 years.  It’s hard to break habits like “pick up all the ammo”
---
I would agree with this, but then it would be way to easy to grind for three star weapons! I do think they should at least increase the rate at which 3* drop three star weapons
---
sledge hammers can have the concrete rocket mod but not super sledges and a sledgehammer with a rocket is not a super sledge thanks bethesda
---
I completely agree with that truth. But I’d rather go to the legendary vendor instead of a duping trader.
---
I wore this outfit for a while! Def recommend
---
When did this bug happen? I got the breach and clear trophy Jan 21. Dont have heart of the enemy yet but I'm not sure if I've done it yet
---
Now I need to learn how to use photo mode
---
The same person who would filter water with coal.
---
The moment the name appeared after discovering the location, I yeeted the fuck out of there
---
That's a thing? I thought it's the other way around. Unless it's those gutsy robots screw their Op. True damage bullets.
---
I would literally kill for the NCR Ranger outfit.
---
It’s actually decent XP and scrap. And despite what you may hear, I don’t find it totally weapon-destroying. As long as you aren’t over burdened, you can run the silo and then when done FT to your base to dump scrap, do a quick repair and then FT to the zone / SBQ. 
---
My very first time solo and learning it took quite a while. 
---
The enemies spawning while you’re looking for cores isn’t that bad.
---
You on ps4? I can just sell you one.
---
I've been trying since launch, I just can't get either one to trigger the PSN trophy, tried with three characters so far!
---
One of those characters had been active since thr beta.... So that might be why, but shouldn't explain why my other two can't trigger the trophy.
---
so their mercenaries
---
I made a deal for a tse shotgun. Thanks though
---
Doesn't make sense. Leave console in rest mode and game will automatically updated without doing anything or using PS4 remote play.
---
I love stories like this!
---
I got a drill against 5000 Halloween treats at the Watoga Highschool terminal. I was close to psychosis atm. Never used that terminal again.
---
Not in the current patch, they are all currently normal spawns
---
That’s how the multiplicative bonuses in the game are figured when two multiplicative effects are factored together, and that’s why sentinel assassin doesn’t put you over 100% damage mitigation. When multiple multiplicative effects are multiplied together you receive diminishing returns from each additional effect.
---
True
---
Easter bunny mascot mask, craftable and atom shop tagged
---
It also always has nuka grape which heals rads but not mutations.
---
I was recently holding the Charleston bot and invited every person on the server figuring they would notice my location and not one person accepted. Oh well.
---
Someone said no
---
I just did and got a one star garbage armor value at 16 caps, and a plan for ashtray. People wonder why very few people still do SBQ these days. Poor loot killed the beast.
---
Yup.
---
2-3 hour dungeon? Isnt htat a raid?
---
This guy’s the real cryptid. We oughta be hunting him instead of Sheepsquatch.
---
That's not a multiplicative bonus. That's not what multiplicative means, dude.
---
But okay, I'll go along with it.
---
How was it decided that that (.5•.15) is multiplied by 1.5 and not 1.15?
---
I'm guessing we have to trade a outrageous amount of caps for them now.
---
You have to craft it I think. Check your bench.
---
I believe there is a hidden damage mitigation value for PA. Someone else should be able to elaborate.
---
Yeah I’d read about a couple and some funny experiences when I started playing. But, this was amazing and really changed my outlook on this game.
---
How do you think they make bread that's gluten-free?
---
Same, lol, but I am taking care of a newborn
---
Do you think there is a pile of eggs near a cross under a colapsed bridge somewhere?
---
Cant be traded,has the atom shop icon
---
Same here, unfortunately.
---
I can do 125 if you're still waiting.
---
Wait there's an island in fallout 76? I have not seen one yet
---
Lol (char)coal it’s used on water filter to remove something
---
I don't even wanna say how many Atoms I'd buy a skin for literally just the 10mm of That Gun (it's over 1000)
---
Not a small tunnel with few mobs and a quick liner path. 
---
Raids is usually defined by a dungeon with 3+ boss fights. It’s just a bit bigger. In addition most dungeon have multiple paths or routes to take.
---
So how do I farm legendaries from there if they don't spawn. I miss the war zone where I spend all my bullets taking revenge on them for griefing all players.
---
good point, but still, people can change.
---
The cement is more than likely used to grind the razorgrain into flour
---
Which would have made more sense for filters to be made with wood, instead of actual coal.
---
Oh shit. Yeah I’ve met you a couple times. I asked about your exploding gun. I’ll send you a friend request
---
This could easily tie into the Responders too, tbh
---
That's weird. I got b&amp;c with my character that I've been playing since the beta. I did have to do the early story quests again with a new character though, so I actually got the get to lvl 50 trophy before I got the leave the vault trophy. I'm not sure what would cause yours not to trigger. I'll try doing heart of the enemy tonight and see if it works for me
---
That's dumb why can't we use caps for it caps is currency. Secondly if a item costs weight it should be tradable.
---
I know it's an old post but thanks for the info! BTW, while looking for your post I came cross this [article](https://gamestoday.info/pc/fallout/why-converted-munitions-factory-is-the-best-public-workshop-in-76/), it's a copy paste from this. Just thought it'd be good to inform you, in case you weren't aware of it.
---
Mmm Rock Buns!
---
Ballistic damage , energy damage ? 
---
Then again what’s shooting at you ? Seems like robots with heavy bullets use anti armor which in sense cuts the effect of your armor.
---
Power armor is not in armor rank so it might not be affected by such ammo type from npcs?
---
Lobster Trap Helmets and Coastal armor
---
Keep on changing your story. It so adds to your legitimacy.
---
Where? I've never had more than two spawn at a time :(
---
Nice, that’s gonna be me in 3 months ;)
---
Or cloth how paper cups turn into cloth ?
---
I think the autocorrect monster got you, but if not, it's lime.
---
How I judge if I got my money’s worth is a hour of gameplay is worth ten dollars
---
For whatever reason it didn’t come up. Try sending me one when you get on.
---
Yeah I regret it a lot. Untilllll I finally make that agreement for a trade (which sometimes falls through)
---
Yeah, and they could add a dungeon under the prison where the responders went to retrieve the armor, but never made it out.
---
I launched 3 nukes over the weekend. Each time i did so on empty servers at like 3 am. My buddy and I will switch off in shifts holding the same workshops till the server has like no pop then we launch. This way we get all the xp  this is on ps4. I see nukes launched every night usually.
---
It was an atom store item , I wouldn’t make sense that anybody that did not dedicate the whole “ egg hunt” would be able to get them.
---
Kinda like a , yup I got them all eggs
---
Oh you wanted the right LEG unyielding sentinel ap refresh heavy combat armor and not the right ARM? Snap, trade off...lol
---
Yeah, but the problem with the BOS is they are so self centric that had they been more open with non BOS and people without a military background, they and the people they attempted to protect and use for supplies would maybe have survived. Instead, they decided that if you weren't a member of the brotherhood, then you were basically not worth their time, unless the brotherhood needed something. Their self centric policies is why I say they were pansies. Besides, what grown man or woman wants to be a squire? Trying to recreate the medieval neo-political ranks that makes people fall into a caste system as well as a rank system. They were the reason for their downfall. 
---
But it is a game and I was only being /S in my last post.
---
? Could you explain a little more?
---
Just pick locks, bring cores, you fly through everything. The only bs part
---
Is waiting on the slow bots walking. It takes like 15 min.

I just posted a bunch of stuff on the filthy flea market. Lower level legendary stuff.

I too ran into this unplayable problem, ruined my whole experience of the main game of Grognak &amp; The Ruby Ruins. Also the side game of fallout 76 is a good break from the main game.

Add them for free , make them an annoying robot quest reward giver , idk a mr gutsy greaser that has a leather jacket it’s in love with rose ( or in lust ) loves his oil and paints and turpentines.
---
Plot twist hi has a sniffing sensor that gives him the exact shade wanted lol
---
I recon you can trade legendary for tokens. Higher star more tokens. Then maybe you’ll be able to buy legendary for high amounts of caps. But hey, that’s just a theory
---
But the exact same cups in a pack turn into plastic!
---
my guy, doin' the real work
---
Dude I’m rocking this with the ritual mask... it’s awesome. I’ll post a pic in a while. By far the best outfit I’ve ever seen in FO. I usually just rock armor because I think it looks great and functional, and I usually avoid “outfits.”
---
I made 2 cross platform trades that netted me 15.5k in a single day, and then I bounced between max caps to 20k for several days after making trades, and then I blew it all filling out my last two pieces of armor. I've been an addict since.
---
Sentinel/Assassin pieces are almost always trade only. You'll be hard pressed to find anyone willing to part with them for caps.
---
High ground was my trick to survive the quarry. Came in from the Khan camp, ran along the ridge and jumped across the gap to one of the pieces of machinery, then rained hell down on them with my grenade launcher and my anti-mat.
---
Fix this shit already.
---
How in the hell is all this happening.
---
The only thing I’ve experienced on this list is the can’t attach mods one.
---
And I’m using attach in the wording as if you have the plans and the material get rid of the mod and build it.
---
Is the last (Onyx) Egg out of the shop already? It's not coming up for me. I've logged out, closed the launcher (in task manager) and reloaded and restarted my computer, all the steps, but it's not in the atomic shop.
---
Go to the floor tab and use the upper floors. They snap into any stair and can float anywhere. That’s how floating bases are made.
---
Er, I don’t think you have a very good understanding of the game then. Most people who know what they’re doing swap cards around, because it’s efficient. Obviously low level players who can’t swap cards (because they don’t have them) don’t. You can’t really take them into account when assessing the balance of the system...
---
Are you saying you always walk around with Super Duper equipped? Because there’s a lot of good perks you can swap to, and it doesn’t take “90%” of your time to do so... literally half a second. 
---
More importantly, it doesn’t matter what people are doing in general, because people can be wrong. What matters is that the system is imbalanced. Intelligence is a worse stat than strength by far, for example. There’s no reason to go 15 Int except very very slight convenience or a very very specific build. There is every reason to go 15 strength. More carry weight, exceptional melee damage even without melee perks, and many great perks that are universally useful to all builds etc. 
---
Simply put, a build with 15 strength and 5 Int can do everything a build with 5 strength and 15 Int can, but better. The only downside being... you have to scrap a few more guns to get the mods you want? And you can’t use all the power armor perks together at once? Shucks.

It works for me, because all I do is make free low level gear for low level players. So that meant I needed to scrap a billion guns to get all the mods for every weapon, and Int helped with that. And the weapons I craft automatically start at 150-200% durability, which is actually useful when you’re giving them away. But... that’s a very niche build. My build would be far more powerful if I prioritized myself and set my stats accordingly.
---
Yeah been gone for 1.5 hours (the end of 24hrs). You've missed it sadly :(
---
Nice! You got the jackpot for sure ;)
---
And people try to argue climate change isn’t real
---
Oof.
---
When she flys in place, it's someone with cripple (like one gun army or +50 limb damage). It's kind of annoying having someone who doesn't know to let her land. They cripple her in the air and keep firing because they don't know any better. I don't think it has anything to do with charisma perks.
---
What gets it done fast is firing a few shots at her head as she comes in, she gets annoyed and lands. Keeping her grounded lets the melee do their thing too. She goes down pretty quick with the right set ups, doesn't matter who's there.
---
You're in for a long haul, huh
---
I did the overseers camp one after 3 hops he was there few click towards flatwoods before the doges and the molelpests on the right hand you should be able to spot a tent right before the river he should spawn right in front of the tent under the tall tree super easy to spot as before that I got a crash satellite , some scorched and the. Finally the juice man
---
This is more of a prediction of what will go wrong after tomorrow’s update
---
And for my sanity put in a rejoin last server. My game froze twice last week once directly after I nuked prime and then fast traveled to watoga, and another halfway through the queen fight I died and was greeted with the black screen of infinite loading. That’s two key cards , couple thousand rounds of 50 ammo , and almost my controller all lost for nothing. 6 months in end game still bugged.
---
Love the Mr. Gutsy greaser idea, just hope Bethesda sees this; been begging for a while.
---
Adding that to main point!
---
like in the basement of whitesprings or something with all the other vendors ?
---
Same thing for me on the xbox. Happens all the time.
---
Not sure if a terminal will do it.. but it’s a thought.
---
I always try to make my CAMPs look like they belong in a wasteland. I don’t like any of the clean stuff, it looks so out of place. The brick especially, but even the barn is a little too fresh for my immersion.
---
All of it together 100k
---
Who needs that much caps? Damn
---
Scrub 6 standing by
---
Yea you can’t put mods on some things right now.
---
\&gt;bump
---
 Dungeon definition depends on the game. In ffxiv a dungeon is a 4 player, 3 boss and some task, maybe a puzzle, with guaranteed loot.  A raid is stupid hard and consists of 24 players and 4 or 5 bosses. Plus trash. and guaranteed loot. Neither of them take longer than 30 minutes to an hour. Unless you die a lot.
---
In wow raids and dungeons mean something different. I haven't played it but I am aware that a raid often includes a very large party and needs a few hours. 
---
In guild wars dungeons and raids are different again. 
---
So... that was a dungeon... just not an MMO dungeon. If you want mmo dungeons you're playing the wrong game.
---
Boiled and purified water now have a condition and turn into drills upon rotting.
---
I was hoping that with the addition of the Sheepsquatch and cryptid hunters  that they would have added some new factions for both worshipping/protecting cryptids, one cult(faction) for all or or one for each of the cryptids, and than one for hunting down and eliminating cryptids, which could be the agency (can't remember the name of it) that Wolf was communicating with. 
---
They could have some good events that would work for both sides. Using OP's example if you're with the cryptids you try and protect the eggs so they can hatch and if your with the agency you're trying to destroy them with the robots.
---
IKR, each time there’s only like 2-3
---
Nobody liked trading with Trashcan “kiss my grits” Carla.
---
Not sure,  I’ve never given anyone a reason to block me.  I had one pvp encounter early in game because I fired back at someone but that’s it.  Generally mind my own and avoid everyone lol
---
I would like to have something like Maxson's battlecoat from fo4
---
This stuff is awesome and cheap! Best to wash it down with some water ...
---
Anyone know why this quest keeps coming back for me? I've done it three times and it just pops back up again
---
Ooooh... not to be that guy...
---
but its lye.
---
(And yes, the rhyme was intentional).
---
It’s like some sort of daily, just not flagged as such.
---
I have some ill give you for free later if ya want. I have way to many.
---
Also laser rifles with explosive are indistinguishable from shotguns based on firing, as the explosive effect turns any shot into a bullet, whether it's plasma, flame, cyro, laser, all convert to bullets, this is one of the things that made explosive so OP it got locked from appearing on non-guns.
---
How do you know if an event's about to start?
---
I’m sure you’ll be able to repair it with a repair kit...that’ll sell ‘em.
---
I wish I could reproduce this lol
---
You have discovered quarry junction
---
That should be plenty.  
---
Whats your build like?
---
Yay for you! Oof for him....
---
I don’t really have a consistent build. I have level 2 of rifleman and that’s basically it. I’m gonna go in tomorrow with Power Armor
---
This just inspired me to spend way too much time hopping servers for the sole purpose of looking at vendor inventories LOL.
---
Melee is fun, can be very satisfying on an angry day
---
I think they're both really potent and fun builds.  
---
I'd say melee may have higher damage output potential however, if that's part of the equation.
---
Wouldn’t a private server be a pay to win then? One could simply farm all the XP, claim all the workshops, loot everything, and buy the rare X-01 mods from vendors while not having to worry about any other players. Everything else that you suggested is valid and I agree
---
Last two times there were no legendary and highest lvl was 42.  I'm 105.  It was unusually easy on two different servers
---
A rifle is a rifle if it's non-automatic or automatic. Tank killer and tormentor both cross over. Ground pounder, ________ rifleman and _______ commando do not since they specify a group.
---
I'd think that's what is probably holding you back, but not sure.
---
For current and future ease its probably best to really focus on one of the weapon types, and since your already up on Rifleman a bit it's probably worth it to put one point in both Expert &amp; Master for 20% increase (huge).
---
They fix things. They just seem to break as many things at the same time.
---
Yeah, that's some Ukrainian site that steals Reddit posts and makes them into articles. It's been shown on here before. Thanks for complementing this post.
---
West Tek: got 6 no star legendery one 2 star and two 3 star supermutants in one run
---
I wish we could play them somewhere other than I game since it’s online.
---
The problem isn't not launching nukes its the fact that they almost always hit Whitespings or Harper's Ferry. I have about ninety hours in the game on PS4 and I'm going for the platinum trophy but in those ninety hours I have only ever seen Scorched Earth pop up twice. One time I nuked it and we came pretty close to taking her down but the timer ran out, the other time some idiots decided it was a good idea to nuke Fissure Site Prime while Charleston and Whitespings were already nuked, so naturally no one showed up to do Scorched Earth. Now I'm waiting for someone to nuke it again because there is no way in hell I am ever gonna try and shoot another cargobot out of the air for a fucking keycard
---
a sneaky rifle build your level should do fine.
---
In 3 runs I got 0 legendaries haha
---
Thanks again!
---
Firecap as mentioned around the Forest, especially near Slocum Joes. Brain Fungus I usual go Whitespring service entrance and Fort Defiance.
---
No it's more in the middle area of the upstairs, next area from the bartender, off to the side (behind some lattice I think)
---
Ya they fix things, but my beef is the "unable to mod our gear" for 2 weeks.
---
I just wish you could do the wear this outfit challenges/missions while wearing them under power armor. Even if I have to take my helmet off to do it would be better. I dont wear armor under my power armor so I usually have to skip these quests
---
You can also check the frat house with the nuka lamp room. In there you can find an assortment of nukas if you haven't been beaten to it
---
That is a way to paraphrase what I'm saying. Though I am saying specifically that without compelling characters there isn't mush to carry the story besides holotapes...which feels a little...hollow. xD
---
Some gross things existing doesn't make other things not gross. -shrug- Like you said, that's an individual viewpoint. 
---
Though I feel like it's the medium of all these deaths, caught on tape, that really lend the creepy voyeur aspect too it. It feels weirdly intimate to hear so many people's last breath..and we're collecting them? Creepy.
---
I wasted more time than I care to admit trying to figure that one out, simply because the direction on the map is wrong.
---
Can't you just join the Heart of the Swamp event, and tank some of those stranger mobs that always spawn?
---
How many Deathclaws? 400 DEATHCLAWS!!!
---
I plan on making a brewery/vendor when player vending happens. But it doesn't sell well to in game vendors, at least from my own experience:(.
---
or just "That Gun" :-D
---
Underrated post.  I for one welcome our cordless aquatic overlords
---
OP just really wanted a chance to be patronizing on that one, lol. Or he only ever played one game before 76. 👀
---
lame-ass joke
---
Or just code it to reroll cards you own and can't upgrade.   That way if you max, get 2* and a single it could possibly roll something new.
---
 I have a TS Submachine Gun I'm trying to sell, or are you looking for a single action rifle?
---
May help to find a spot where you can place your camp a little bit higher, it allows for you to build up a bit higher. Maybe on a cliff edge or a tree or even a stack of rocks. A lot of the time you can build *almost* 3 stories but can't place a roof. That extra little bit of height can work wonders!
---
Same with me. I usually always see one when I'm on. I haven't seen the cryptid event come up nearly as much lately but I guess that has to do with the 2300 caps needed to start it
---
Would be cool, I live somewhat near bunny man bridge, have gone there recently and it's sadly not the same. I think the locals hated all the traffic so they repainted it. Just not as eerie as it once was lol.
---
Preferably a single action.
---
I'm in Virginia Btw, didn't know if there was something similar in west va?
---
Honestly, I think Deathclaw Island is a flop. It’s obviously based on Wheeling irl and I really wished that they would of:
---
1.) put Wheeling in the game
---
2.) put a casino on the island
---
They could’ve kept with the concept of deathclaw island with both too. Imagine, the casino exists but is overrun by deathclaws that burrowed in from a cave beneath it. Would of allowed for a “partial dungeon” effect of having the casino full of deathclaws and then a cave beneath. Also would add some more character to the otherwise barren region as well as allow for a more high level area in an otherwise low level area that high levels would never go to
---
Any data mined?
---
You watched Juicehead didn't you? Lol
---
Think so
---
Australia
---
Hm, both named Anubis.
---
😉👍
---
Well, from the point of view of fo76, Glory will be badass.
---
Yeah they’re not nearly as much of a threat. Quarry Junction can destroy a level 50 courier. Old Olney is tough too.
---
Is that real Presidential Power Armor and how do you get it if it’s real?
---
Yeah, what else did ya expect?
---
Yes. There’s nothing wrong with that.
---
About to launch a nuke on robco and the place across the street. Join if you want gt is UnblestBiscuit
---
If you're in the area and something dies, you get exp and loot, that simple. People will say "but then people can power level!" and to that I say "they already do. It's only marginally more of a pain in the ass to do it now". Realistically, the person who does 2% of the mobs hp in damage doesn't deserve full exp any more than the person who did zero, when you have a high level 1 or 2 shotting it.
---
This is my primary use of it as well lol
---
Word - joining you shortly!
---
yes, what where you expecting?
---
If you have Fallout 4 and the Pip-Boy mobile app, you can play the holotape games you've collected in game on your phone.
---
Finally at level 160, i launched my first nuke today. I tried once before, but the server crashed just after i punched the code in. So i didnt bother trying again until now. 
---
I dropped the nuke on Alpha Prime, mostly because i needed violet and crimson flux. I was there fighting the Queen and her adds all by myself until a level 96 showed up to help me. We didnt stand a chance. A couple more people showed up with only a few minutes left. I think we maybe took a third of her heath off. 
---
I did check the server first for player levels. There were a few 200+, and a few 100+. But apparently no one was interested in wasting their time fighting the queen. Usually when the Death from above quest pops up i’ll see 10 players waiting outside the nuke zone. But i guess we are losing interest. 
---
Definitely due to the amount of time and resources just arent worth the reward, especially if the reward is a drill. 🤦‍♂️
---
I also ran through West Tek today 3 times on the same server. Each time there was 6 legendary enemies there. At least one 3* each time. 15 minutes or less, and one or 2 shots per enemy. Much less work for the same or better reward as the SBQ.
---
That...is hilarious.  I can only imagine what he was saying  “Ok, I’m back.  Thanks.  I was so thirsty I could hardly talk.  Bob?  Bob?”  &lt;looks up&gt;. “Oh dookie!”
---
If only it was that simple to get the responder vendor to spawn. I just want that coat man.
---
I met him along the road West of the prison (from a post here on Reddit). Good luck finding him. Not entirely sure the hopping is totally worth it to find him, but it’s nice to see those balloons off in the distance.
---
yeah but then they couldn't make any money off it so... fuck yuh... /s
---
My confirmation bias supports this observation as well.
---
I accidentally send out a few a night...while fast traveling to the location  you happen to be at. Click the wrong thing on that badly managed pile and boom, team invite instead of fast travel.
---
I think this is pure speculative Hogwash. 
---
Until someone from Bethesda officially confirms this, I treat the speculation the same as that sighting of Elvis at Macy’s last week.
---
usually if you log out and back in it will fix it
---
The out of order thing can be pretty annoying. It's often the best ones that get that way too - the lil flavor tapes. The main and side story ones tend to be setup pretty well in a way that you can follow them as you explore an area.
---
I offered someone 7.5k for Forrest and was turned down.
---
I might have two yellow. I’ll check.
---
man im not sure how your viewing that version of the site. it was meant for april fools day, ive since updated the site to remove it lmao. 
---
it is real, but not obtainable.

# Leveling
---
**1-15**: Do your responder quests all the way up to the point where it sends you to Top of the World to unlock various workbenches and for easy early game exp. Use whatever weapons you get. Hunting rifle is fairly good - will one shot most enemies assuming you have one appropriate for you level. Melee is also a good option. Taking the Poseidon Power Plant and doing the "Powering Up" event there 3 times will give you all 3 power generator plans (including fusion) for free. Plus you can get some fusion cores stocked up, and it provides a free fast travel point. Lots of scorched and good loot inside as well.
---
NOTE: If you don't have a **raider set of power armor**, Go to **Cliffwatch** (look it up here[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) ). Server hop until you have a full set of level 15 raider power armor, killing the scorched there (good exp / scrap from weapons and easy to learn most of their weapon mods this way). If you plan to do this, put your camp down in the hils above their camp. I'd start this at level 10 if you have nothing. Swapping to Survival Mode might be a good option here - less PvE players looking for low level power armor sets there.
---
**15-25**: Do Rose's raider faction quest if you want. It's not required for the other faction quests, and in my opinion, it's a bit dull (although I like Rose's voice actress, the quests are somewhat boring IMO). Be sure to do the quest at **Camp McClintock** for your Soldier's Certificate (needed later). New Gad is a decent grind spot for this level range, or alternatively, just explore and gather / kill as you go in the Ash Heap. There's a lot to see, and a big part of the fun is exploring the map and finding all the excellent holotapes and learning the stories of those who didn't make it. Take at least Poseidon Power Plant and defend it as necessary (these quests are great for leveling)
---
**25-50**: Do the [Miner Miracles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles) quest and get your free Excavator power armor. Have someone craft you a Gatling Laser or two. Seriously - I'll do it if you're on PC or someone on the community for your console will if you ask. This community here is really nice. You're going to start going up against level 25-40 enemies that require quite a bit more DPS than what you're used to, so you will need sustained firepower with easily obtained ammo. That's where the Gatling Laser shines. Works particularly well against super mutants and mole miners, which are high health but lightly armored. Disover and take all 3 of the power plant workshops. Make sure you lock the fusion core generator or people will just take your cores. There's no penalty for this. You can craft Fusion Generators instead of doing the "Powering Up" event, which takes a long time, although the ones at Monogah and Thunder Mountain are worth your time, since the mobs there scale up to your level to some degree, and there are lots of them. If someone contests, you can try to fight, but in my experience this is very rare. Ask nicely if they wouldn't mind letting you have it, but if they insist on taking it, that's just how it goes sometimes.
---
Do the various events that come up, discover which ones give the best loot / exp. Distant Thunder is very worth it for the chance to get rare power armor plans. AWOL Armaments is a guaranteed 3 star legendary enemy. Save up caps. You'll want a few thousand by level 50 so you can buy a bloodied Gatling Gun and/or bloodied .50 Cal and the mutation serums you need. Most people will be happy to craft all of those for you for 200-300c per serum. Just make sure you have Starched Genes rank 2 on or you could lose them. Craft lots of .50 Cal ammo with the Super Duper / Ammosmith perk.
---
Explore the map. Enjoy the stories of all the dead people. Have fun, in a depressed, gloomy way (I say that in jest, but I really enjoy it)!
---
At 45 you can craft you end game set of Excavator Power Armor, though you may want to wait until you have all the crafting perks for it to make it cheaper. Higher int (up to 20 I think) when crafting = higher base durability on it.
---
**50+**: The end game. Do the Enclave quest to unlock the ability to nuke, as well as a free set of plans for X-01 power armor. This is great power armor, but the mods are very rare, and it's costly to craft. You can buy plans for power armor mods of every type but X-01, however, you get the plans for base pieces of X-01 for free (but you need to get materials to craft it). Also do the Brotherhood of Steel quests to unlock a free set of Ultracite power armor. You can get Ultracite mod plans from the Scorchbeast queen, which you'll be doing a lot of.
---
Nuke Whitesprings and farm ghouls to save up Glowing / Hardened mass and High Radiation Fluid. You'll get lots of Glowing Blood which is great for selling to vendors, as well as Ionized meat. Bloodied Gatling Gun is a good choice for this due to ammo efficiency and being able to one shot Glowing Bloated Ghouls. Nuclear Material sells well too.
---
Nuke Fissure Site Prime and farm SBQ for Prime Receiver plans until you get them all. Gather Violet Flux / ultracite and craft Stable Violet Flux (sells for 100c per, used for making most desirable ultracite ammo types).
---
Trade. Gather. Save up caps. Buy plans for the things you want to make. Finish picking up all the crafting / situation perks in the build. Make friends so you can reload Whitesprings and farm it over and over after nuking. When you learn .50 cal prime receiver, you can make .50 cal ultracite ammo. Farm steel from mutants at West-Tek. Mine lead at Lucky Hole mine. Smelt lead with acid farmed from Toxic Larry's meat (snallygasters) or that you've gathered. Make lots of ammo. Sell or use it. Learn all the plans. Offer more services. Run end game dungeons (they will definitely be out by the time you're at end game).
---
Reset your level for more powerful abilities (new system coming later this year) to become a "legendary" player. Farm legendary items and trade them into purveyor (coming next month) for tokens to use to reroll legendaries in that search for the ultimate GG weapon (a bloodied 25% fire rate .50 Cal).
---
Try other, inferior character builds and wind up turning them into mules because your main is so much stronger. (I jest, but this has happened to me).
---
Sweet, appreciate it
---
Xmas lights sold out atomic shop item sorry man
---
I have met him in the middle of the toxic lake, southwest of the water park. I have also met him on the ridge southeast of the ammo factory. Both very strange places.
---
cant datamine whats not released.
---
F :(
---
Yeah, I can agree with that, it would have a positive impact on team play as well as when bumping into randoms. They say they lurk reddit... hopefully they are paying attention.
---
Damn dude that's crazy
---
Check this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgaoyi/end_game_pve_build_guide_bloodied_heavy_weapons/
---
I guess it's kind of exploiting an in game mechanic. 
---
But really if you're in Adventure and don't want to open yourself up to PvP - don't accept random team invites and don't take workshops.
---
Lock scrub foils in attack position.
---
Happened to me too. Have 6 of the same key. Showed 2 on the officer. I just grabbed one but it duplicated in my stash.
---
But I can’t complain about that. I got the pink one for free from a Reddit user that was very friendly and simply didn’t need it or caps. Asked me to pay it forward. 
---
I have done so several times over. But I might have mixed up Yellow with blue. Let me check.
---
Lol. It was more like, "Back. Why am I dead?" "I didn't do it!"
---
Awh, that's so awesome! And okay, no problem. Just let me know, again I appreciate it
---
Yeah, but wasteland and Nuka tapper aren’t on thier, which are the ones I’m talking about since the others were in 4.
---
No, for a couple reasons, one as pointed out, this would exploit-level you crazy high for very little work.   
---
Two, no one would show up if they didn't get the rewards. If you stop getting xp/loot/etc from farming nuke zones, you'd stop doing them.
---
If you're stuck for a small (3 players) group add me IGN: wilsonraine114. Got me, Pittbull and xeexee. I'm level 111, pittbull is 151 and xeexee is lvl 26. Xeexee doesn't have a mic (he can hear us through team chat) but me n' the bull have mics on discord. 
---
discord is #0831 wilsonraine114 :)
---
If you group up with them, you'll get loot, even if you don't get exp.
---
If you know the code, do you need. To collect the code parts?
---
I got the same on PS4.  I suspect it has to do with lots of stashed \*\*\* crap waiting for the legendary vendor.  Too many special items in the game as everyone is farming legendaries as fast as they can.  Probably also explains disappearing items .
---
I've had two occasions with events like this where scorchbeast respawn the second they die. So if you can kill them fast another one crawls out instantly, so if you stand at the fissure and just keep filling their heads with lead you end up with a mountain of scorchbeast corpses.
---
Literally just restarted NV a couple of weeks ago. God it feels good being back in the Mojave
---
I've said this exactly many times in here
---
I started wearing the Easter mask along with the sheepsquatch mascot outfit.  Looks great but I wish I could add some kind of blood splatter skin to it.
---
see above for mounted wendigo
---
Where's your camp located? Depending on where you're built, you're more likely to have your camp destroyed. Or, and this is the most common, people are just assholes
---
I actually have a golf club I've reserved explicitly for this event.
---
True. It would be nice if Bethesda updated the Pip-Boy app to sync with 76 as well.
---
That Colored Lights was included in one of the extremely expensive time limited Christmas bundle called "Magic of the Season". Costs 2000 atoms and also came with a snowman statue, one Flamethrower skin , Elf costume and 2 player icons.
---
It's on the railway bridge between Seneca Rocks and the Wendigo Cave
---
You got seven items for free.
---
No. Proven absolutely nowhere.
---
Who are you hanging around? I'm a girl who plays Fallout and I rarely get hassled, and if I did I wouldn't get all woe is me about.
---
It's a joke you don't get it. When someone says they wanna fix a problem they just 20 more doing that.
---
Yeah, they were just being assholes. Sorry that happened :( are you on xbox? I can give you some mats if you need 'em to repair
---
Today = 1 word. Not being mean, you just shouldn't go through life being wrong.
---
Nah man I'm on ps4 but i appreciate you wanting to help out
---
Scrub 7 reporting in. All systems are go.
---
You saw him too? 😂
---
No problem, good luck!
---
I wish when we dropped loot it would be in an egg, instead of brown bag. Then I could squat, and lay an egg.
---
Fair enough, was in a rush
---
Aw man
---
I like it and I'm fine with it as a reward for doing pretty much nothing more than logging into the atomic store for 6 straight days.
---
Thanks gonna try tomorrow
---
There are also paranoid people who blocks all.
---
It's only happened twice to me where trolls just started destroying my vamp. I quit server as soon as I can when I see the warning or see them doing it.  Minimal damage done both times with no follow.  Cant give then any satisfaction in their griefing or it will keep happening. You traveling to them and trying to fight just got them all riled up. Then when you left they went to do it to someone else. If you just quit, your camp disappears and they have nowhere to go but circle jerk onto a bagel.
---
nope :)
---
Why? Is anyone ever trying to eat only the freshest food? There's no sense in putting that at the top
---
Thanks very much, I appreciate your help!
---
 Not gonna lie, I have the paint splatter armor skins and the pink sprinkle pip boy skin and I love both. the armor skin reminds me of the pack from the nukaworld expansion. But I also like to rock more grungy realistic outfits and armor. I don’t use the skins on ALL my armor, just as accents. And I’m not really into the huge heads either. It would be great to have some more badass outfits in the atom shop.
---
Is it a special area that requires a quest? If not I guess I shockingly need to put on my explorer pants on here I thought I scanned it all.
---
My mascot head is broken. An ear is missing. I'm pissed.
---
Alpha sort is the only remotely useful one because at least you can find something by name, assuming you can keep track of that in your head
---
Any t-60 brotherhood paint jobbed power armour for your rank, gattling laser and plasma pistol side arm :)
---
I thought I was the only one that liked the exploding robots.
---
Don't worry, it's just as useless as the OP says
---
It’s free.
---
You need a set of weightless armour.  Great for this.  Stashes in stash box for nothing too.  Vendors always sell it cause nobody seems to want it.   It's good stuff.
---
I usually wear the Western Duster with Patrolman Sunglasses. I think it looks pretty cool.
---
Is there really a way to get brotherhood paint in this game on power armour? It’s got to be really rare I’d think.
---
Same goes for me... hope it gets fixed, its getting annoying
---
It's broken because it doesn't sort in any useful way.
---
...which is why the spoiled stuff should be at the top
---
I mean it's meant to be an Easter bunny mask so I don't really think so, but it'd be great if they put a nod to that in somewhere. Like perhaps a corpse wearing the mask and covered in blood on a bridge or something.
---
Yeah there's brotherhood initiate paint all the way to brotherhood elder paint, each paint job shows the different rankings :) they are quite rare as you say though, but people do paint t-60 power armour on the market subredit for you for a small fee
---
Yeah except it's not. Most people want to eat whatever is closest to spoiling so it's not wasted
---
I wasn’t aware. Thanks for the feedback!
---
I love it. Easter eggs hidden in my camp forever and a new, scary mascot head. And it was all free!
---
Please fix your reddit so I don’t get excited about presidential power armor
---
Does it not go away if u log out of the game?
---
Thanks, kinda was hoping they all would look different.
---
Server hop!
---
One of these updates will undoubtedly cause ALL melee weapons to do zero damage. might as well do it now and get it out of the way.
---
IM WITH YOU! GLORY TO THE LAZ-PLAZ!
---
good catch
---
Yeah. He’s lost some weight.
---
How much?
---
They dont want you to confuse them with CDPR
---
me too
---
Yeh I agree
---
Thanks everyone for your thoughts! WE ARE CYBERNETIC ORGANISMS, MAN-MADE FLESH OVER STEEL ENDOSKELETONS!
---
So that’s why serum recipe prices are going through the roof?!?
---
the disappearing crap is f'd. my friend lost two of his main guns in two days. i lost my T51 and a week later my ultracite chassis poofed; lucky the ultracite armor was still scattered in my inv.
---
im not sure what you mean? is it  showing a version of the site that shows the pop up? or is it displaying as a preview on reddit?
---
I focus on adds too. I have a pre-patch explosive gatling plasma with the splitter barrel, and basically aim at the giant pile of adds and hold the trigger until they go away.
---
Bethesda never has, and never will make a game with a menu that works. Theyre all inv management sims masquerading a RPGs and none of them have menus that function.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
youre crazy if you think bethesda would FORCE you to play their game so you can PAY them more money. dont be surprised if todd announces at E3 that the atom shop app is 'available right now!'
---
Bad news. I have two brown. Two white. Two blue. One yellow. One green. One pink. 
---
Sorry.
---
Might just be an asshole who still thinks queen's health scales to hits. Personally, so long as I see you actively shooting or punching something, I am game. That said, I often don't move to revive because people tend to give up before I reach them, and a low level that's not playing smart can drain my stims very quickly because of their squishy nature.
---
Yellow uniform? Cause if you have one yellow uniform and you're willing to part with it, I'm down
---
Nuke her again, or fight her again through some else's and tell us what you got.
---
I've not accepted many random invites, but the few times I have it's been friendly. Hell, a week back I was just wondering around a nuked Whitesprings and suddenly got an invite from a level 400 player. 
---
I thought to myself screw it and accepted, best experience I had to date. We started hunting down legendaries together, he'd drop me any he found. He gave me three mutation serums Speed Demon, Marsupial &amp; Healing Factor. That alone single handedly changed my fallout experience as I never really tried out any mutations. Then he led me on an adventure to unlock the Nuka Quantum Paint.
---
So far, if they are hopping about one shotting the shit, they do not accept my group request, either not noticing (which is possible) or not caring.
---
Quad assault rifle L50 1*
---
It's 7% damage reduction per PA piece, or 42% for a whole set. The rad reduction is 15% per PA piece.
---
I just want some nice skins for LMG, if mods are too much to ask. More skins for all weapons please, people will spend their atoms like crazy. I myself won’t waste a single atom on hairstyle in a wasteland shooting game, but I’ll buy skins for all the weapons i use if they aren’t too ugly.
---
Not willing to part. Like you, trying to collect ‘em all. Like Pokémon. ;)
---
TSE Energy weapons don't drop anymore, usually they're trade only for other God rolls
---
Or maybe place it in the upper left corner of the screen as a smaller version of the current system, so I can actually aim at shit.
---
I have been having pretty good luck with the horde quest
---
Haha, understandable! Just thought I'd ask. I appreciate you checking!
---
No prob. Eventuality, I’ll get Forrest. But out of principle, I won’t go over 8k.
---
What you didn't get the 3☆ AE 90% reduced weight lever action like everyone else?
---
There is an indicator in your social menu. People with the campfire looking thing by their name are in survival.
---
I can't access it from work, but it is one of the map mods for pc on Nexus. I think it was called the crafting map or something. They guy datamained the location of all places in the game and where all power armor could spawn, where all ore is and where all crafting stations are placed and a big jumble of crafting stations ended up in the previous mentioned position. His theory was that a lot of interiors existed there. Also, if you look at the map every now and then in-game you will notice that often players seem to be at that position when loading into the world or when loading into an interior (before actually entering the interíor and then ending up marked at the entrance place on the map). The one big **IF** here is that even if this is correct there is a chance the interiors could be so far under the normal map that the Nuke-bubble might not reach them anyway.
---
I don't expect people outside my team to revive me but to run up and hit me with a sledgehammer which doesn't do anything but waste there time and dps lol
---
I wish there was an option for the armor pieces to go over the outfits, I just stick to the vault suit for this reason.
---
Six year olds build the best stuff.

Indeed. But I wasn't talking about delaying patches but features/changes. I would be incredibly stupid to think that a dev team would delay a whole patch based on feedback.
---
Sniper for Survival Melee PvE
---
My friends and I have done the same, we have given up trying to clear it and accepted just ignoring it forever at this point.
---
Wow, never knew that. Likely what it was then.
---
After a dozen wood pieces and a drill i finally got a weapon drop from the sheep, a one star nocturnal grenade launcher. It’s probably still at the WS vendor bot’s, since i don’t believe anyone will buy it.
---
Nice
---
Try playing and making your own decision.
---
LOL true. I guarantee they would produce something less half-assed and absurd looking
---
FYI you can wear armor over the harness, road leathers, brotherhood officer uniform, marine wetsuit, and another one. Anything listed as under armor in the work bench. Some of them really make an armor set pop better than that royal blue jumpsuit.
---
I went onto the website, put my stuff in. So I think I am just going to have to start over. I think explosive is where I want to go. M79 or the automatic, with grenades.
---
I personally don't see any reason to do adventure.. each to their own I guess. I've had no problem with being "griefed".
---
yeah, that blows. My method is to farm both harpers ferry and west tek - get them on their ~10 minute cooldown rotation, which is about how long it takes me to farm both and drop off stuff, then leave game / rejoin my alt account. You could do this with a friend. IDK if you're on PC or console. Seems like people tend to be bigger asshats on console.
---
Thank you all for your help!
---
I'm downloading now just wanted to see how the community felt how the game is going.
---
how awesome is the tesla coil torso? i lost my T51, it poofed away, and im making a new one; wanted to try different mods than my X1 this time. what do you run on the arms and legs and helmet?
---
Not gunna lie, every thing they’ve added so far has had been the opposite of “fallout” stuff and just been silly time fillers. This game is going to die if they don’t actually start adding FALLOUT content.
---
Thanks, I don't think I've come across any of those on my travels yet.
---
Exactly this. Right now they’re selling lies as ‘RNG’
---
They removed the serum plans? I never read about this, that's terrible.
---
Yes this! The easier acquisition of atoms would allow me to feel pretty okay with buying skins and if they had sales and stuff it would just add to the fun
---
poorly
---
Sometimes when you're facing higher-level enemies It's because somebody at a higher level spawned in there before you and Max their level out. It's weird and especially when your doing the raider quests usually somebody at a higher level spawns in and raises the level to the max of the divide. It was annoying for my level 20 or so pistol character but I just ran past the higher level stuff to get it done.
---
A vampire had an 85k bid the other day
---
and the collage poster
---
I'm kinda amazed that people don't get this. Clearly this should be spelled out better...bright flashing neon yellow hazard signs, instead?
---
Not for trolls.
---
They've added some content fixed some bugs. I've been enjoying the game since launch. The Burrows is a nice change of pace from WS for farming.
---
I believe he's talking about when you first load up the game. You can't very well see the social menu without being in the game, right? He's asking for some kind of indicator before being thrown right into a world. Something like a pop-up that states, "You're about to enter Survival Mode, are you sure you want to proceed?" Unless your friend tells you otherwise, you're not going to know they're in Survival or Adventure mode, so a pop-up indicator would be nice.
---
They are pretty common and you eventually find plans to make them. In case you also didn’t know - you can upgrade your under armor to offer damage and energy resistance
---
You joke but I had someone do this specifically to fight a glowing mirelurks queen
---
Be nice if I could ever find them, that vendor always has the worst mods. I got the jet pack a month ago, finally, nothing since.
---
Well I play with a guy who has not charisma and luck maxed and we’ve done the sheep even multiple times and he’s gotten exterminator garbage or hunters shit every time lol and I’ve gotten the absolute best drops I’ve gotten since I started playing and my charisma is at 4 and luck at 7.
---
So I don’t believe so
---
Ok that's the type of things I was looking for last time I played it crashed to much which ruined my fun and I love pretty much all fallout games including the one that shall not be named lol
---
Nothing to add but great writeup. Thanks for the high quality content
---
I'm so glad I got my full T51b set eventually...  STA is terrible when there's so many bats and mobs running around... your screen constantly shakes and is nothing but bright lights... terrible.
---
Though I've had one instance at The Thorn where only a single scorch popped every minute or two and not a single SB appeared...
---
(on a side note, really disappointed that modding 'perfect' STA T51b PA pieces drops their durability cap).
---
Would have* Not would of
---
My fav setup is a simple drifters outfit and a atom shop cowboy hat
---
K
---
It's better. It still has some stability issues, but not nearly as bad as at launch. I only disconnect/crash 2-3 times in a two hour play session now, instead of reliably once every ten-fifteen minutes.   
---
There have been some balance changes, some good, some not so good.    
---
  
---
But yeah, over-all, it's a more playable, slightly more finished product than at launch.
---
Great write up, we have very similar builds.
---
Here’s a clip of my dps, had 7-8 other players there as well: https://youtu.be/UwKSM3em9Q0
---
That would depend almost entirely on the other stars.
---
I agree - not sure the actual trigger, but dying is the way the game despawns them. I think.
---
It's just like that sometimes I think. I've spent several hours tweaking mine and trying to get things to fit in place, would be nice if it was a little easier for sure. Sometimes I have to log out and back in then all of a sudden something I was trying to put down would when it wouldn't before.
---
Dude that's harsh it's like 100 each from the vendor when he spawns.
---
wait for tomorrow, you cant server hop
---
I thought I paid more. My bad
---
I’ll try them out thanks for the info
---
No. Luck improves durability of items found but not quality of items.
---
I prefer the firebreathers outfit... it looks cool af
---
welcome to f76
---
The amount of non food stuffs that’s in most processed foods is crazy. I know Canada has laws that say how much of non food can be there... kinda gross but unless you have a completely sterilized facility, it’s gonna happen.
---
Balanced build of both. It’s what I use and it’s extremely fun.
---
I got the crappy one with +1 perception
---
Yeah building is pure hot summer day,in leather pants ass
---
bloodied auto rifle sniper with a ton of PER, cant go wrong, you can tear it up medium to short range. i carry a lever for long range sniping
---
Aae wouldnbenclose to 6-10k.
---
Depends if you know how to barter with the guy or have stuff to trade to reduce the price.
---
Hell yeah dude. There are people out there who sell these outfits for super cheap. When the whitepowder jumpsuits were going for 10k+, I bought mine for 2k!
---
Weird is one thing, wacky costumes is another.
---
i love your username
---
Oh ok, yeah solve one problem and make 20 more...ugh
---
 You can do all that now
---
Ok thanks that's very good to hear sounds like I'll have more fun then the last time I played
---
we need a thunderdome
---
All CAMP lights cause the 'eternally firing heavy weapon' audio bug when turned on. enjoy!
---
Waaaahhh.. I got caught for stealing, Waahhhh someone stole my junk.. waaaahhh.. Baby wants a bottle.  
---
Jeezus, face the fact you got a bounty from stealing from an owned area, and a bounty hunter came and collected your bounty + your junk.  
---
Don't baby the game any fucking further then it has been because nancey boys like you can't handle the fact you fucked up. :D
---
Just like how we can all buy loot boxes in EA games
---
6-10k? I see 3* AAE levers go for 25k+ whenever they are sold for caps. Most of the time people wont take caps for them.
---
Sounds similar to what happened to me! Im level 51 and have never been in a nuke zone. So, no nuke zone showing, I fast traveled to whitesprings station and Then started my "level up" sweep of the exterior of the hotel. Some level 68 Mutant Warlords were hanging out by the guard shack with dead robots everywhere. I took them out from a distance then proceeded. All of the normal ghouls I usually faced around the cabins and exterior were all bloated glowing ones! Kept pressing alomg until I got to the front of the hotel where I saw (thru VATS) a level 91 glowing deathclaw in the distance down by the gazebo. So, I sniped it from afar to tag it and get it's attention and drew it up to the bots outside the hotel. A sentry bot, 3 protectrons and 2 mister gutsy bots helped me take it down.  I forgot to add that all the flora were of the nuke kind, so I picked up all kinds of flux (although I couldn't do anything with it). It was a hectic but fun run!
---
you’re gonna be a newborn in 3 months?

‘fuckin time travelers...
---
Thankfully a future update not too far off will make camps immune to damage from other players in Adventure Mode when they're not flagged as hostile towards the camp owner. It should make situations like this a lot less likely to happen. Though I suspect the more dedicated griefers will find ways around it.
---
As another poster has said, your best choice if something like this happens to you is to just leave the server once you notice your camp getting attacked to minimize damage.
---
Went to a encryptid even last night and it was crazy to see everyone band together and help even non team mates up. Then trade plans after the event
---
Meh... ?
---
Most of Biv's recipes are worth 50 caps in-game by default. I have a handful of duplicate recipes and willing to trade for new ones I haven't acquired yet.
---
Nukashine is cheap, but the others, especially the flux recipes sell for good bit o caps
---
Or when you join a game before even loading the game itself. There have been times where I agree to trade/buy items and they send you a game invite through the system and when you join there is no warning that you are in survival mode. If you don't know what survival looks like than I can see this happening.
---
I do it solo several times a week. The silos are just so tedious.
---
That's the whole point of the design, holy shit. How many of these posts are we going to see? If you can't plan your perks accordingly, you deserve to be punished for it. Don't level up a card until you're ready for it. That's the whole point.
---
Yeah, same thing happened with.. Played B.E.T.A visiting/discovering locations with my main is impossible. So had to start a new character to make up the different..  
---
T'was annoying to be honest.
---
Not really given we’ve had wacky costumes before
---
Gear might be your problem. What kind of weapons/armor are you using?
---
my level 80 has luck 14 and several perks that make it more likely to loot specific things.
---
Doesn't change a thing sadly, my luck is just as bad as everybody else's for legendary loot
---
If the Camera wasn't available.. Doesn't mean I Didn't "Do" the challenge.. It's because I "COULDNT" do the challenge. Learn the difference.
---
I'd have to quit fer good. :'( don't do me like that.
---
Dang.  I couldn't figure what what exact to put things.
---
The hotdog eating i completed
---
The other 2 - i couldn't complete even 1.
---
The coal says to put in carts. But every cart i approached had no signal to press A or anything.
---
Same with the big ball.
---
The coal took me to the flying cars and it has a small circle but when i got there there was nothing there and when i went to look in flying cars, the compass disappeared and so i was looking at the blank ground.  
---
Was that a glitch?
---
Is it explosive? Yes-20k No- idk
---
If we don't get a NCR ranger outfit I will send angry emails
---
Haha shut up Eltanin. We do.. because we've now missed out on earning 170 atoms.. because Bethesda stuffed up.  
---
God you're a moron... open your eyes.
---
That's the weird part there was no nuked flora
---
Lol. I’d rather just buy the nuka dark
---
Mmmmmmm... Yeah boy.. Keep 'em coming.
---
Yep. The range can go from 2k to 25+k based on second and third effects.
---
I’d be happy to take you up on that offer instead lol
---
Yes we do. We couldn't do Daily or weekly challenges.. Because Bethesda decided to pull the camera from the release date, and failed to reshuffle the Atom challenges... and thus meaning we missed out on 170 atoms because they messed up.
---
Yes far better, but that should be expected
---
I can give you a free nuka dark drink if you want. GT Dookieinyourhat
---
I meant that for you lol!
---
Yes we do actually..  
---
Couldn't do our daily challenges/weekly because we didn't have an item that was meant to come out on a date, then Bethesda in all of their wisdom decided to postpone it... because of reasons? and then failed to shuffle their atom challenges..
---
I appreciate everyone's help.
---
I once answered a Reddit post about some bulk junk. I tried to join his game but it said he was offline. Instead he sent me an invite to his game. I was very apprehensive of the whole situation since it involves junk but did it anyway because really it's just junk. I left all my "junk in my trunk" but feared losing my aid items. Anyway, it pulled me right into survival. As soon as I noticed, I backed out of the game and didn't complete the sale.
---
I only got disconnected 2 times and only 1 game freeze so yeah it's gotten a whole lot better
---
Looting is the entire point of this game. There’s zero difference between stealing and looting until after the action has taken place. I would never knowingly steal from another player, but there’s no way to know until after it’s been done. That’s almost as stupid as you are.
---
It would be nice for that list to be orginized either way
---
Something similar happened to me and it stopped after a relog
---
Good to hear
---
What would they do for heavy guns?
---
I know with minigun we could get the giant ammo pack on our back and gatling laser wont have a giant battery on our backs anymore since they now take fusion cores.
---
Just hope somebody at beth really thinks about this, would open many role playing options
---
Oh yes... Please do. I'd love to run around with my Gattling gun strapped to my back.. And a Western Revolver at my hip!!  
---
This would be so fun!!
---
I was told my game is done downloading and have the next days free of no work time to get to some fallout
---
... I wasn't saying anything like that, I was putting the daily and challenges up front with the idea. Making player think more around earning even if literally nothing changes function wise.
---
As an owner of an assassins-sentinel set, and a bloodied explosive flamer (not the same weapon, I know, but both fall under the legacy energy-explosive weapons category) I can say that they are fantastic and I likely would not ever trade them for any amount of caps. There simply just isn't anything really interesting to use caps on in the end game.
---
As for their effectiveness, they are extremely popular for a reason. During a game of hunter-hunted, I was in the final two, tracked the remaining guy down, he saw me, and immediately ran into a cave. His plan, was to wait for me to follow him, and kill me while I was loading in. Poor guy didn't know I had the said assins-sentinel set. I duitifully followed him into the cave, and listened while staring at my loading screen to the three shots that rang out from what must have been a two shot-explosive shotgun at point blank range. When I finally loaded in, I checked my health bar, which, as a bloodied build, is eternally at 80% rads/20% health, and it had barely moved. I pulled out my weapon (which at the time was actually a bloodied Grognak's Axe) and swiftly ended them.
---
So, if PVP is your end goal, and you have the opportunity to grab any of that gear, do it. It will likely coast you an equally rare piece of gear, but it will definitely be worth it.
---
Preach!!
---
There's  only 6 eggs....the prize is a bunny head that you craft at the armor station
---
They no longer accept phone calls, and if they do somewhere, i have yet to find the right number
---
just a loading glitch, someone nuked it. your game was just all like "🗿". its a really good glitch
---
Pretty much what's been said.
---
I have had workshops clear themselves. Thunder mountain sometimes just turns on for me 100%. We have a thing her n I. And today there was a new one i was exploding like a tse shot on a melee hit
---
Okay awesome thank you, I logged off I haven't logged back in hopefully it's gone
---
That's the price I saw then for but admittedly that was a little over a month ago.
---
This is my “glass cannon” unarmed build. I don’t really like to lock pick why I only have one i perception. I run Bloodied DCG
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1673db&amp;d=ej4c72s40sm0sn0se2ss2sf2sg2cu2l71lt2lu2ir2aa2a41a71am2eu0la2pk0au2&amp;w=&amp;n=Nasty’s%20Melee%20Build&amp;m=249cefh8
---
And lose all the money I sank into buying atoms and the time i put into leveling my character?
---
On ps4 after we killed the SBQ and everyone else  left i found a legendary piece of armor on the groun and not in a bag, however i could not pick it up.
---
Lol the good ole’ bug hunt I see
---
Glad to hear that I am not alone in this.
---
part of me wants to boot up my Xbox and join but the rest of me knows the world is gonna be full for the next 30 mins
---
I have seen this and it sucks. I have also heard (??) that some players do this to “drive off” a player so that another friend can join that server and place their camp in that spot. 
---
I moved my camp to a less “popular” location and have been ok since.
---
I don't accept a ban because they told me I will eventually be unsuspended, as this is only temporary. That was two months ago without any form of status update.
---
Can I ask what your build is?
---
Sorry, I can't answer your question, I'm looking at running something similar and looking for help putting something together.
---
My glass cannon build with Bloodied DCG. I don’t like lock picking why I took all out of perception lol
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1673db&amp;d=ej4c72se2ss2sf2sg2cu2l71lt2lu2ir2aa2a41a71am2eu0la2pk0au2s92&amp;w=&amp;n=Nasty’s%20Melee%20Build&amp;m=249cefh8
---
Is this for PvP, PvE or both?
---
Yes, this so much. There is a little too much goofy stuff which detracts from the darker atmosphere a lot of the series had. There was always humor, but it was dark.
---
I guess it's one of the drawbacks of multiplayer though, Joe Sixpack is never going to fit within the setting of the game, so you can never get the same sense of immersion.
---
&gt; If I show up to your CAMP or workshop, I’m there to help. But also loot if there’s something I need. 
---
You said it yourself.. Quit your lying. Perhaps you're the stupid one here.. Gawd.
---
You can find the poster in the atom shop for free
---
Honestly, that’s what I bought WS Caddy for I think. Can’t remember what I paid for White Powder.
---
Sounds good. Added you.
---
Kill a scorchedbeast naked while in uncanny caverns with a level 1 Meelee during a rad storm while intoxicated sick and everything else you could stack.
---
Reward 10 atoms
---
I was on that server. Sadly the loot wasn't all the good, but was able to pick up some much needed flux
---
PvE but I might take it to PvP, not sure on that yet.
---
I set up a crystal extractor for a couple hours yesterday and made runs to the deep mine and tenagra and then went looking for microscopes to pass time on the extractor. End of the time I had enough for probably 500 cryo rounds. Not perfect, but workable.
---
You just gotta find the right people. It's rare, but there are people who are willing to sell stuff for pretty cheap. Those people are my favorites haha
---
It used to be better. Now it's all just crap to sell to the vendor IMO
---
just got your request - added :)
---
A guy is trying to sell it for 50k on the market. Got a 20k bid lol.
---
Consider trying no cards at all...see if you can enjoy the game without the headache.
---
that is the party poster, its a different item
---
How do you find this survivability wise?
---
South Park
---
I’m one of them. Kind of pisses people off sometimes for undervaluing but then I make up for it by offering obscene amounts for stupid stuff that I want because I’m bored and at cap limit.
---
Dude this in my opinion is more legendary than a rolling pin
---
What's south park?
---
How did they keep killing you "over and over" if you didnt seek revenge?
---
Because then you could grind out 100 levels and have the same flexibility as somebody who grinds out 300, and we can't fucking have any kind of reduction in grind.
---
Never mind for a moment that it's Bethesda's Fallout, which is different than Interplay's Fallout. Never mind how popular that damned woodchuck mascot head was for a while. Never mind you collected easter eggs. Never mind the creepy run down/damaged ascetic.  
---
When the hell was Fallout ever \**gag*\* punk rock (or as I believe it should be called, Punk Lite, same great taste, less filling)? Bethesda's Fallout has been tracked well for their goal of expressing the damaged futuristic 50's vibe they have gone with (cant for the life of me remember how to spell the proper word), and original fallout was at times tribal and at times retro-futuristic and at times backwater and bitter survival, and not one of those things is *punk rock*.
---
Can we also add back the NukaShine quest for those of us who lost it? :(
---
Omw
---
Yeah, no, that shouldn't be acceptable. Draw the line somewhere, people.
---
Just to add, as a person who basically stays in sneak mode unloading my silenced lever action at her head, nothing is more infuriating than some asshole scorched bumping into me taking me out of [caution], so as everyone else has said, it helps us maximize dps on the Queen.
---
For real. Still waiting for some stealth themed upgrades. For the most part, they only have cowboy themed stealth (not my thing), and the outfit choice I've chosen: drifter outfit, medical goggles, and the surgical mask. I think it looks good, a little futuristic with the medical goggles (thinking Star Wars), but I could really use something else, stuff that's more tactical, maybe a hood, and definitely everything blacker! Same goes for power armor, though I rarely use PA. The woodland PA theme is nice. Of course, they still need to fix things related to the stealth build. Enough is enough already! I hate how badly stealth is broken. 
---
Also, kinda getting screwed over lately with Atoms earning, with all the camera based challenges that are unable to be completed, as far as I'm aware. Both daily and weekly have completely unattainable Atoms. Meanwhile, they continue to pump out new items for sale. Kinda, no really, messed up!
---
Why would it piss them off? You're the one selling, it doesn't affect them in any way. What it does is shows other people who don't have a lot of caps that they can get the rare stuff for cheap, cause they see someone is selling it for cheap, now they have hope!
---
Under level 10 !!!
---
You must have logged in just after the nuke cleared. It's the best time to farm except for the robots. That always sucks.
---
is this the first time you are doing the camden quests are is it a daily?
---
He’s just saying that it’s more or less a community thing. Sure it seems a bit odd if it’s not previously established, but he’s meaning to do it in a “I’ll scratch your back you scratch mine” kinda way.
---
Now I don’t have to go to hell to kill that son of a bitch all over again!
---
Unbalanced because you don't have the gear 2 defend yourself or because your 2 lazy 2 get the gear 2 defend yourself?
---
Sorry for late reply. When u fast travel look up the hill run up along the concrete barrier.  If you don't see the body reload server.
---
I rarely die pve wise. Nerd rage, evasive, serendipity, and lone wonderer work amazing. I run WS, West Tek, and Civic Center everyday with no problems. I don’t think I could play anyway else now lol
---
theres already a mini deathclaw in the shop for 200 atoms...
---
Poor people that gets griefed by this.
---
The thing is it's trendy to hate on people who play Fortnite, personally don't love battle Royale but I don't make fun of people who play them. I think there is room for people who like silly costumes and more serious ones. Sometimes I like to have a more serious actual post apocalyptic look, sometimes I like the funnier ones (vampire costume is one of my favorites), hell sometimes I just like a mismatched assortment of nonsensical pieces. It all boils down to how you wanna play, no reason to put down other people in the process.
---
Is that to farm XP?
---
Also I noticed you have Adrenal Reaction mutation, does that count for Unarmed weapons also?
---
Highly doubt you spent much on atoms in which case those you could probably get back.
---
As for leveling I started a new character and using all the possible leveling up buffs it’s an easy 5 level until level 40 after that hitting level 50 it’s end game territory.
---
Plus I’m sure somebody tally all atom shop items and two things 
---
1. Some stuff ain’t worth the price 
---
2. I wouldn’t add to lots unless you dropped a big money to buy all cosmetics possible
---
scrap from the bottom of the list first and then move up...problem solved.
---
Haven't you played an old-school RPG like Grognak before? You have to order the patch in the mail and wait 6-8 weeks for delivery. Also, I hope your computer still has a floppy disc drive.
---
I've accepted several random invites with mixed results. Twice they were looking for a PVP partner/victim so watch out for "teamates" who get you into fights you didn't want.
---
It was magical to see those sell for 20 dollars.
---
Adrenal I run mostly because I run Bloodied. You’ll rarely come across me and see me above 20% health. Adrenal and talons work with unarmed
---
Well we are trying to roleplay as slaves, its just that todd howard prevented us to get our hand on real mesmetron and slave collar.
---
Im hoping its in the next update
---
Lol !
---
This is really what they should do
---
Still, its the principle. If you say its temporary, it should be temporary.
---
God i hope this fixes power armour disappearing
---
Try blocking a friend and ask them if it does exactly that on chat or discord.
---
Given that for them giving 10 atoms a day even 500 for a plastic bag ( instead of canvas ) 
---
Six camp items and one cosmetic is good for “ free”
---
There has been mention of a new faction coming ..... I'm thinking Institute pre-cursor ... so yeah, cyborgs sounds about right.  This is supposed to coincide with "Legendary" player effects .... so implants sounds about right too.  I like the idea.
---
So? Where are the keg plans though?
---
This is great. I need to hear stuff like this after encountering some shady stuff going on on the survival server. I think people are wall hacking or something over there

It's a permanent addition.  Players can buy keycards for 1750 caps to run the event again after the first free quest run through.
---
Forever. It's not a limited time event like Fasnacht was.
---
You aren't behind Whitespring clubhouse with a bunch of turrets, are you?
---
Very true
---
Fast travel from outside the area , to either the shepsquatch or lucky hole mine ( or the one under mount Blair )
---
4 out 5 times I would trigger a Camden daily
---
Did this post go through? I tried 3 times
---
There’s loot around and in workshops that isn’t locked and doesn’t belong to the player that owns the workshop. That loot sits right next to owned stuff and you don’t know what is what until after you are already wanted for stealing.
---
Thank you! I wasn’t aware of this. Does it always cost someone the keycard? I only ran through it a few times on my old account.
---
You're in the wrong place. At level 24, you should be: North in Toxic Valley, South in Ash heap, or East in Savage Divide. It sounds like you followed the main story quest chain almost exclusively and ended up int he Mire or Cranberry Bog (or Whitesprings, which is weird because of the high level player concentrations). I'd go explore them map some, uncover the areas mentioned, trigger a few local quests maybe (like Grafton and Wavy Willard's Waterpart in Toxic)
---
I am 100% sure that most high karma idea posts have been viewed and passed along. Only a few have had that response as after a specific point most ideas it is natural but some they show their interest.  
---
Hell I know for sure that one idea they didn't respond on was looked at as that is where the pearly peepers seem to have come from.
---
ikr.. can't believe I actually bought it back at that time either :P

Carabinier
---
Would be nice if my X-01s arms and legs didn't disappear last night
---
Thank you! I’m going really glad it’s staying. Fasnacht was fun while it lasted.
---
Just give me Bozar skin for .50 cal.
---
Why would you travel back? Just log out.
---
Don't worry. They are going to 'fix' the over repair 'bug'.
---
If this is the guy I saw the other day the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more. One and nineteen more.
---
I had the atoms but I’m glad I saved them I got those power armor paints most of them but the black bird and hot rod
---
I have extra of every mask that dropped
---
Yeah one person always needs an assaultron recall keycard to start the event, you put it in the terminal in the shed.
---
For a 50 cal? I find that hard to walk with both in and out of power armor
---
Yeah fair call haha.
---
Yeah I figured Talons was a must have, just not sure whether I wanted to run bloodied or not.
---
What/how do you do when it comes to Scorchbeasts/Scorchbeast Queen
---
I'd love to join too! PS4
---
It needs a server/game design like most survival rpgs out there, where you can build anywhere, buildings are permanent despite you logging on or off, and you can build close to other people's bases, or share one with GUILD/Clan members.
---
ftw

Feel free to add me! I'm level \~80 &amp; have a fun camp. xa0t1ca (the middle o is a zero)

Reminder Bethesda sees no lore as set in stone and sees things as fluid. Example In fallout 76 in the burrows we have the explanation for why jet becomes known on both coasts. Scientists experimenting with chems.

Lore in bethesda's mind is fluid you can add more to it shifting around the parts to make it fit, discredit bits as rambling of a mad man, and so on and so forth.

Why a TSE Lazer? Why not a much more common TSE Any Other Rifle?

All the damn time

And crossbow modes

If you think that is bad then you really don't want to see what the actual ingredients are in Chinese made dog treats.

Oh, hell no. People who do that crap deserve whatever they get.
---
Hurr durr 22222222222.... Take that mess and fuck right off, dude.

For a change of pace, watch for the Horde events. Always at least one legendary, and many of them no longer require you to find them, you just spawn in near the target.
---
Ok? I'm not a troll I'm asking a question
---
I've been working my way through the atoms challenges under combat, social, etc. for awhile now
---
Also twisted muscles is a must have. Bloodied causes you to do so much Dmg.  I carry around a BE Handmade for scorchbeast. even though I don’t run commondo on it still does crazy Dmg. If they land before I kill them they have had a bad day lol.
---
It's a small side room, and you can't see the bar until you walk into the room. If I recall, it's got pinkish colors.

Good call. What about a command strip?
---
Lol good catch, I just noticed that
---
Another post from a couple days ago said that it would be posted sometime soon. They data mined it and it would go up within a few weeks (this they data mined it 2 weeks ago). Don’t have the source.
---
5 seconds
---
Uh huh. Because of course, most of the folks running around in full sets *totally* farmed them, and didn't get the during the duping days *at all*. Wink. Wink.
---
Just saying, trade up into the gear you want instead of bitching about it
---
Traded into it mate.
---
They did already [mention a prestige system](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps) that's coming out sometime during Summer as part of Nuclear Winter. No idea how it'll function, but it'll make your character "Legendary".
---
Hey, just curious because this is the second time I’ve seen someone say that a turret tower base people are bad? I’ve never seen it. What happens?
---
And with a full suit of unyielding armor and low health they can get +15 Int, then pop a berry mentat for another +5, then eat scorched beast brain for +3 or brain fungus soup which is much more available for +2.
---
So 5 Int guy can be 27-28 Int guy whenever he wants to craft something good.
---
If memory serves, looking at the door, turn around and go through the first left. It should be a rather short walk around a couple of corners. If that's not helpful I can go over there and double check.
---
Yesterday I snapped up a workshop just before a new Level 2 could. By way of apology I crafted him a hardened scoped level five hunting rifle, and then left the game.
---
They really screwed up with making Faschnacht one of the first events. Nukashine is bugged for some people and even that is being falsely said is limited time. I bet people are even asking if the Burrows is limited time lol.
---
I 100% agree.  It's in the noob zone and its for the early scare.
---
Haha RIP Scorchbeats.
---
As far as armour, what would you suggest? Unyielding?
---
" Patch notes for tomorrow's update will be posted during maintenance.  "  
---
Great more hidden nerfs, god I do love this communication thing so I don't have a chance to be cynical.
---
It is three different rifles with three different kinds of ammo. Are you running any perks to reduce weight?
---
Remember, kids: You still hold the conduits when you are downed but not dead. If you manage to grab all three, pop the boss a few times, and then go down, \*don't give up.\* Hold out as long as possible. Request help in the last 5 seconds so those of us who know better can go stim you.
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
Get weight reducing armor.  I have armor that adds 20 pounds to my carrying capacity.  Get "deep pocketed" or "pocketed" plans.
---
I expected a nice steel Goliath and a Pony on the side. 
---
(Sarcasm)
---
It says if you look at the arm pieces ....
---
Where is his den?
---
End game is level 50. After that, it's gear, and refining a build that suits that gear.   
---
So there's no "set" level. You could, 100%, run West Tek at level 50 no problem, with the right weapons and perk card choices, and mutations.   
---
You can absolutely flail in there and die over and over again at level 500, with a shit build.
---
Can we get a black and white checkered suit? I’d love to dress like Benny!
---
I honestly can't tell you what their intent is, beyond just being assholes, because you don't get credit for what your turrets kill. But the way it pans out in my experience is that you jump into the Whitespring to take advantage of the nuke, only to find all the glowing ghouls at the clubhouse are dead because somebody built a wall of turrets at the back entrance. Kinda ruins it for everyone else, ya know?
---
With the low dmg and high fire rate that won't last you long
---
Aid is definitely a big factor in your weight. Also make sure to check your misc tab, ores and gun powder build up rather quickly and weigh a lot. There's no perks to reduce rifle weight, so they'll always be a major contributor to your weight in this type of build. I only carry two at any given time, and I have a weapon weight reduction effect on one of my armor piece's. I'd recommend stashing either your hunting rifle or the handmade and switching them out as needed.. Or stashing the Black Powder rifle if you find you rarely use it as it's a pretty situational weapon. You might want to invest in Bandolier (in Strength) if you have access to it. It will definitely help with your ammo weight.
---
Uhh everything about my Tuxedo wearing, bunny head having self screams badass.
---
Yea unyielding cavalier is what you should work on getting.
---
That is dope
---
lol just found out? 400 lead ore from lucky hole mine smelts into over 1k lead
---
what
---
Profligates like you belong on a cross
---
if you’re on Xbox you can buy the fixer plans from me
---
Or "old" female gamers. Or so I've heard. ;\]
---
How much are you asking?
---
Talking 2 people gets you a long way. I've traded into a full assassin/unyielding sent set with trades. Takes a long ass time but anyone can do it.
---
For most of the two handed weapons especially the lmg yes.
---
But for the bigger guns like the 50 cal, gatling gun, plasma gatling, etc.  I can only see a couple of them working with it like the guns that dont have their magazines sticking out of the side.
---
Honestly j think they should do it just like they with the previous fallout titles where theres a giant ammo container indicating what kind of heavy gun you're using
---
Only catch is I dont know what it would look like for the harpoon gun and broadsider.
---
Must be a real cunt
---
Do you toss the Deathclaw or does he toss you?
---
Great write up, I run a similar style build as you, fulltime power armor, bloody/explosive but with shotguns.  My only concern is marathoner, it doesn’t state  it, but I remember reading on here it does not work in power armor.  Just a thought, here’s my build for fun.
---

Congrats!
---
One of the FO ranger factions would've been formed for another 60-100 years.  
---
The closest we'd get is the police riot armour, which is just police versions of combat armour, with less bulky versions of the marine helmet.
---
This isnt a misplaced cursur as I was on controller doing this, in the weapon tab the whole time then the armor poofed, I even recreated it while recording and sent that to bethesda
---
I go here daily and get atleast a 3* &amp; a couple of 1* legendaries.
---
It wont let ms post picture but I found a dead deathclaw that says its named travelling merchant and then there where two schorched that got stuck in the ground and there heads where sticking out next to it
---
I have 2 professional drinker cards, yay
---
Pictures
---
I like this build with some cavaliers armor, but I'd take off Tenderizer and put those 3 points back in endurance for lvl 3 Solar Powered.  It makes a hell of a difference during the day.  Very nice build, thanks for the ideas!
---
Atom shop Duster + Marine Assault Helmet or Combat Helmet &amp; Gas Mask  
---
Drifter Outfit+ Combat helmet &amp; Gasmask or Marine Assault Helmet.
---
ive seen them go for 2-3k but it might be more now that the encrypted event never seems to be triggered anymore. up to your budget really
---
I mean, what do you have? do you have a more than 200ms latency? Melee in this game is unbalanced garbage for anyone with even mildly high ping times.
---
Ah yes...
---
Life in the bayous.
---
You forgot the part where you sleep with her sister.
---
And why? They're either going to nerf that shit because it's obscenely unbalanced versus pretty much everything else in the game, or they'll flub it and you'll be rocking intentionally explointative crap for the rest of your time here -- which makes you either a moron for wasting your own time or an asshole for wasting everyone else's.
---
Best of luck!
---
It’s been in game forever I posted about it during beta
---
Back in the day, I was running Drifter's + Combat/Army helmet and a gasmask.  
---
Looked like some kinda Appalachian ranger gig.
---
I legitimately enjoyed farming watoga far more than any other zone. So of course they completely destroy it for no good reason.
---
I get a thing on PC, does it not do that on consoles?

Where is lucky hole mine?

Quad is always an option lmao
---
Yuuup. One of bethesdas many questionable atom shop decisions.
---
Yeah this style can work with most weapons - combat or pump shotguns work well, lever action or handmade rifles work well, etc. I had someone help with the SBQ today running a bloody explosive shotgun build and he was rocking the dps - very good when he could sit right in her face and unload over and over.
---
&gt;You do realise that the fire axe isn't modded right?
---
Irrelevant. I've also killed level 60+ with both modded and non modded fire axes, and occasionally level 1 combat knives / machetes. Inefficient, but doable. 
---
\&gt;  Do you want to check the vod and see if I spent time trying to bug out my party? 
---
As if you can't edit that out. Also irrelvant. I'm explaining a game mechanic, not passing judgement. 
---
The point is, the burrows can be done with level 2 if the player has prior knowledge of the game and sufficient skill. The reddit post is a knee jerk to make people disparage the burrows for being imbalanced.
---
I see the title of the post and go, yeah so? The burrows is fine, and you beating it is no surprise, nor a disruption in game balance. 
---
You're a skilled and knowledgeable player, ofc you're going to dominate the game. That should be cause to laud the game mechanics, not use it for trash talk.
---
I've read it's about 40%, based on a few peoples several-hundred legendary averages.   
---
Personally I get, at best, 10%.
---
Hopefully!
---
I used to have the same issue loading into Harpers Ferry, but it would also shut my Xbox down. I had to uninstall/reinstall the game. The o oh thing I lost were my pictures. Good luck!
---
The fez was up for a limited time within the last month or two.
---
Goofy costumes are going to come out more often because that's the only place they can exist. If you want to look badass and like you belong, just take off your costume, because literally every piece of actual armor falls into that category.
---
I just wear the X-01 power armor, nothing else on clothes. This gives you a lot of free space for looting, but you should build the INT power armor cards for the good work
---
Proof...?
---
I too have seen the deathclaw labeled Merchant. He was dead for me and missing his head. I have a picture of him.
---
I feel blocker is the most under utilized perk for bloody builds.  It’s insane mitigation.  I can count on one hand how many times I’ve died in the last month and a majority of those deaths came from the sheepsquatch laser beam.  PA is insane tanky.
---
The Brotherhood had no idea the Enclave or MODUS existed, so far as I know. The closest they get to a reference is when Taggerdy's terminal mentions Senator Blackwell's mysterious vanishing. But yes, counter faction quests would be interesting.

Is it me...

---
Paging u/eckserah is this something that is achievable and 'tickles your fancy'?
---
Agreed! They probably only discovered them after Eckhart's men resumed production after the war and they began spilling into the wastes, but the Free States do seem the sort to make heavy use of robots.
---
Would be awesome to see that. Been playing since BETA, none of this yet
---
&gt;. Ask any farmer that does farming routes on the same server over and over.
---
It doesn't, and I am said farmer too. Significantly easier to rejoin the server, and significantly more likely someone's passed by. 
---
\&gt; I checked, no one was present for miles around, 
---
That you know of. You neglect people being crouched on the map or blocking you, or the fact that the map doesn't update player locations in real time.
---
\&gt;  I took more than 30 minutes to get back to West Tek after clearing it. 
---
Quite possible for someone to come in and out of  the location without your knowledge. The thing is, you have to not only check the map but prove no one's around for 30+ minutes, which is unrealistic outside of very extreme circumstances.
---
Yea I don’t run tenderizer, don’t know how that got in there. I run supressor with it
---
So far I think the game is great! It's a beautiful landscape with a shit ton of Mr.Handys lurking around. I've only met one person so far and have completed at least 4 quests, but hey, at least I'm surviving. Weak, but surviving.
---
Side note: the controls are still gonna need some getting used to. Also I have no idea how to work the Atom shop lol
---
Ok thanks
---
When I first started playing there was a camp (I thought it was an in game house) and picked the lock on a container inside. I became wanted and didn’t notice it right away. But when I did I was freaking out because I didn’t realize that’s what did it, then a high level showed up. I just stood there until he killed me...me like level 15, him 100+.  😂
---
Lol yep
---
Have you ever played Destiny? First time raids usually take up to 12+hrs to figure out.
---
Erm.... no.
---
Lucky mucker takes you around the park to deposit coal into marked wheelbarrows, 1. next to
---
The spinner attraction next to the staff office, 2. besides the carousel, 3. off in the “Minor Miner” adventure area and the final is at the platform for the coaster. Dross Toss involves you picking up mining debris and throwing it into the tires quite literally beside of the dross. 
---
These quests are all dailies and one of the games will be available whenever you enter/near the ash heap.

---
go to eastern regional penitentiary 
---
go in the front door and turn left there is a door that is closed i want to say its lock pick 3 or hacking 3 to get it open you can find a ton of prisoner collars in this room and the connected closet
---
Does Mr Slave wear chaps, or assless pants? Two different things. Assless pants are more like regular pants with just the ass left open. Think of Prince at the 1991 MTV video awards.
---
There are a couple of buildings you can jump on, and they can't get you. There's an outhouse in the middle, but I never make it that far, I kill the roach in the shed just outside of the cabins, jump up on it, and hit vats to see what the catch of the day is. Then I pop a psycho and get killin'! If you manage to sneak up to one of the main cabins you can also jump up on the porch railing and then onto the roof, gives a nice view of all the shootables. I guess you'd have to have marsupial tho, but at this point, I think most everyone I've come across has it.
---
Bahahahaha!!
---
One can hope. I'm not too optimistic on it though.
---
Difficulty shouldn't be only super armor and insta kill hits.
---
Oh god early baths were the literal bane of my existence. And don't get me started on pre patched spire.
---
I have my camp in the middle of nowhere for this reason. I did have someone run past it today...the first person I’ve seen since I moved there a couple months ago. I had a couple 100+ players ruin mine and kill me as I was inside at the time. Best to block and switch servers. They get off on the conflict...don’t give them what they want.

No, were about to cross the 6 month mark. Were already past 5 months. This was in December, Not January.
---
Had someone offer 23k for my aae lever
---
&gt;The other areas I farm are Harper's Ferry and West Tek super mutants for steel. 
---
Try nuking penitentiary, just west of Grafton steel, if you ever need steel/plastic. Can hit grafton too. Multiple spawn locations, big building, possible super mutants, scorched or glowing ones. Lots of enemies.
---
&gt;I have that same crafting spec build and you're right, any other player could technically match most of my ability level just by swapping Intelligence cards every time he's at a crafting bench, but I have yet to come across someone that actually does that.
---
i swap my int cards anytime I'm at a crafting bench, it takes like 1 second since mods exist and I have a loadout specifically for crafting benches.
---
Lackluster? It’s a free piece of themed gear that we got for nothing more than logging in for a few days in a row, seems pretty reasonable
---
I would love to join your group for launches. 
---
My gamertag is xxdboy69xx and I play daily for at least a few hours a day. Always down to fight SBQ. I am level 70 and have a decent melee build working perk cards to add heavy guns to my loadout as well. 
---
Would love an add if you wanna have another for your group.
---
Thank you
---
The dead deathclaw merchant has been around since BETA. It's a random encounter, I've run into it a few times
---
Do we know what it’s for yet?
---
Note bloody mess actually makes it harder to loot corpses. I don't recommend it for farming small targets. 
---
Adrenaline is the biggest bang for your buck, when farming lots of enemies. Rank 1-3 is adequate. Rank 1 of every direct damage perk for weapons is also sufficient. 
---
Use that psycho you find in the world. Chem fiend helps, and that chem scrounger too. Chemist + Super duper also help make more.
---
There's an update tomorrow, I'm very much hoping they decide to throw that in there. I just want to leave my decom shower out without being paranoid that someone might come along and destroy it, which has happened before, unfortunately. People are dicks
---
Learn to love the tesla, and carry one just for tagging past those fools.
---
Not a programmer but 1) it's likely your stash is stored on a server at Bethesda and cannot be changed client-side and 2) changing the game's files is a surefire way to get banned. Perhaps once the legendary vendor is released you can cut down your stock a bit?
---
Brilliant idea. 
---
While we’re at it, why not add blueprints for builds?
---
The current perk UI is brutal level 110+. I don’t mind sorting through two dozen unused cards for every stat when making a build. But rolling through the entire deck every time you have to fix something, unlock a safe, or have to hop into power armor is seriously killing pacing.
---
I don’t mind that swapping cards is something we have to be conscious of. But switching job roles is something we should be able to complete in under 5 seconds, not 50.
---
Learn to love missile silos, gyms, ammo smith and super duper perks. Get weights, scrap them fore lead directly. 
---
Lead ore is good... but acid takes time to get. Go for gyms in between mining and waiting for acid.

Sounds like your the salty one

Hunt him down. Finally an end game boss.
---
I will consider it. I only have a little over 2,000 right now but I might bite the bullet on it.
---
\^ This is how windmills work. They used the power of wind to turn the grindstones to grind wheat into flour in ye olden day. It's the apocalypse, so yeah. Concrete works.
---
You don't have to FT to repair. There's weapons/armor/PA/Tinkering stations all around the silo. It is only missing brewing, cooking and chemist crafting stations.
---
okiedoke, just lmk. if the gun is what you’re looking for I can craft it for you for cheaper
---
I found him in Flat woods the other day.He had spawned inside one of the boarded up buildings. You could hear him in there talking to himself while his pack brahmin waited patiently outside.
---
I hardly ever see 100k prices... I see trade only. I would say 99% of the legendaries that are worthwhile are going to be trade only. Caps almost become worthless after you have put a lot of hours into this game. They are easy to come by.
---
This is something i can get behind, because the backpacks so far looks really ugly!
---
I want my active weapon on my back, not a backpack or the option to hide the backpack.
---
player vending challenges added.
---
Personally, I don't think people should get wanted for picking a lock. It's not necessarily a hostile action, sometimes they need whatever you've got locked up or it's some random who wants to check out your camp. It's obvious whenever the lock you're about to pick belongs to another person, considering how camps are/look, and also resource extractors and water purifiers. But I don't think picking a lock should warrant a bounty on your head, feels like a bit too much
---
That's a good point. Grafton Steel has a ton of mutants, takes a while to clear, and Clarksburg can spawn them too. The only issue would be if the whole server shows up to farm the area. Bad enough that I have to deal with that at Whitesprings.
---
I tried this once shortly after launch, it crashed my client a few times before finally crashing the server. Haven't bothered to try it again recently.
---
You can get as many implants as you have points of Endurance. So someone with 9 Endurance can get all 9 implants.
---
Bloodied, and the fact that people know about cryolaters and endangerol syringers. Different players each debuffing her with the syringer stacking was news to me though.
---
And before that, he would send his guys to the basement to kill the "beast" but when they found nothing he would kill them for lying. So they had to use the bear mascot head to pretend they killed it.
---
Probably one of my favorite Raider side stories in Fallout 4.
---
Hmm I think that's pistol, not revolver.
---
It's miserable if you're in a low player population area, sometimes there's only 1-2 servers and you just bounce between them. Uncanny caverns just makes it worse because it dashboards on Xbox, saw cave cricket corpses outside but couldn't enter to try and find a killable one.
---
If you look it up you could probably find it since it's apparently been around since beta and always there so then you could go there there is nothing special about it though other than the name tag and it doesn't have any items
---
Seriously.
---
Thanks guys
---
Found the guy with the 5000 cap bounty.
---
"YOU TOUCHED MY PIXELS! NOW I'M GONNA MAKE AN AD HOMINEM POST ON REDDIT ABOUT YOU!"
---
Or, it could just be RNG. Thousands of legendary items get dropped every day, some player was bound to get the exact same roll twice in a row. Lucky you?
---
Plus, these are one-star legendaries. If it was a pair of three-star legendaries that were perfectly identical, I might get a little suspicious.
---
Wonder if you can hit Clarksburg, Penitentary, Grafton Steel, Grafton, and Grafton dam all at once. That's probably too much area though unfortunately. I'm on the steel farming portion of my ammo crafting run now, still need about 12K. Will give this a go tomorrow and see how I do. Would be fantastic to kill 2 birds with one stone. People might even not show up due to the location.
---
It is less of an issue at the penitentiary (west of, nuking at steel). Remember the prison yard, where the Patrol Duty + Prison break event occasionally pops up?
---
That building is large and segmented, so if lots of players do show up, you still each have your individual building segment (and shared outdoors), while respawning is pretty frequent. 
---
I used to nuke [here](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Eastern_Regional_Penitentiary) at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary when I needed plastic. Grafton steel was OK before that, but the prison is better-- albeit more RNG on what spawns there.
---
Smokin' Jesus titty cinnamon! That is awesome!
---
Maybe make it so you can do it on alts only if they are lvl 100 or higher. This would prevent easy atom farming.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the help, I might try this out, I can always change it later if I don't like it
---
Yes, this also happens when transfering items to/from containers/stashes too quickly. Items from other tabs can be transfered/scrapped if you go to fast.  
---
I submitted a bug report to Bethesda about this the other day. It has been an issue since beta.
---
Yeah, both the "Beer Keg" and the "Postcard Collage Poster" are viewable from within the CAMP Build menu:

---
Think once per account, is better. So each player can only ever do it once.
---
Not Nice
---
Yeah, that's why I stopped. I still check this sub somewhat often and between loading screens, but I altogether left the trading subs because it takes too much time. I used to spend that much with CS:GO trading, but that at least had a monetary payoff. I don't deem getting a good deal on a decent drop I got worthy of an hour of my time
---
Lol I was jus gonna say that
---
I managed to get a video of it happening showing its not a menu jump and the game never even registers its been scrapped, it just vanished half way through
---
I'll be honest, I've only recently started carrying a syringer. Definitely helps. Though, since it's DR reduction, I'd assume it caps at 4? Unless it's multiplicative, which I guess would mean that each application is less effective than the last. If you could get her to 0% DR though, that would be pretty amazing. I could actually use my gatling plasma effectively! As is, I bring 2 characters and apply it x2.
---
What's the name?
---
Traveling pharmacy and thru-hiker are great perks if you can manage it. Also, prioritize getting 3* legendary armor that has the "reduce weapon weight by 20%" effect. It affects all weapons except for grenades and mines. It's currently the only way to reduce rifle weight, except it also works on other stuff. If you wear a full set of this (it will cap at 90%, not 100%) you will be achieving something that would take you around 20 perk slots to get
---
Best thread ever posted.
---
That's what my buddy and I rock too.
---
I don't know what I think is sillier. This post on its own, or all the smug "it's part of the game kiddo, deal with it 😎" comments it'll inevitably attract.
---
Well honestly, people can play whatever they want in this game. Playing as an raider, the enclave, you-name-what.
---
It's your choice to deal with it, but don't complain on Reddit about a how a dude destroys some virtual wood and steel 
---
It's not like there is a repair function for your camp, isn't it?
---
I've seen this before. Killed a ghoul at whitesprings, there was a fire axe on the ground near him (an actual axe, not a paper bag). It ended up being a 1* furious fire axe. Not sure if anything causes it, I would assume something lag related
---
lol fr. camp griefing is annoying but this sub treats it like a fucking act of terrorism lmao
---
You'll be hoping for a nuclear winter in no time
---
Rifles have it easy as they can pick every weight reduction perk.
---
Wearing Power Armor weighs nothing and with Batteries Included the Fusion Cores only weigh 0.3 per core.
---
This is what I've been using for rifles.
---

I use the excavator armor to mine decaying ultracite nodes around the fissures.
---
The Clash would like to have a word with you....
---
Oooh, that’s a first! Any chance you might have a source?
---
Well actually yea I can put something like this together. Would a comma seperate list work?
---
Can’t help but sometimes feel like we’re putting a hat on an hat with the addiction notifications haha
---
You might want to consider *3 class freak and *1 better critical. I run speed daemon and *3 CF and I still have to eat and drink all the time. It will also help strength and intelligence. Just a thought.
---
ABORT! ABORT!
---
That doesn't drop flux or an RNG weapon...
---
i had a guy destroy my whole base.he racked up a 600 cap bounty then he left me a TSE 15% reload speed pump shotty. i dident know how to feel.
---
Tse deathclaw gauntlet
---
I thought player vending was coming on the 23rd, y’all really pushed it back? -.-
---
Dope
---
Watches a man kill one cazadore “Jesus Christ that’s Jason Bourne”
---
I just imagine the ballistic fist from New Vegas
---
The water perk helps quite a bit, and I always have random meat in my inventory. Putting glowing meat and purified water on my wheel let's me manage it on the fly, thinking about getting carnivore to boost it further.
---
Wouldn’t call the devastated economy shaky, even after the dupe clear they still hadn’t sealed off all methods. If you browse the trade discords and subs TSE and other dupe items are still out there in droves. And it isn’t even just weapons and armor, theres folks out there selling all manner of plans by the bundle for cap, trades, and cash. I’ve all but given up on trying to trade with folks cause just about every post on the disc or shop owners only want god roll trades with a remark on their spreadsheets claiming theyre at cap limit on multiple accounts.
---
They're not great, for sure. I think you can make a 3rd floor but you might not be able to have a roof, depending on the angle of the ground you placed your CAMP on. 
---
What drives me nuts currently with my build, is you can't connect "second story" floors to foundations. So I have 1 foundation that's kinda floating, where I would rather have a flat floor with those metal beam things in stairs. BUT NO.
---
I'm in it for the hunt.
---
I’ve met him 4 times now. I have a set of lemonade and hard lemonade if you’re interested in the plans.
---
Because of the amount of stuff we carry I think a little cart would be most immersive.
---
Quad rapid +aim dmg LMG. Just find a nice trench and open fire
---
since you can only get stashes every 24 hours with they would add the cash stashes back into white spring golf course
---
well, atleast she drops now some plans i don't have, after killing her 100+ times before patches. Problem is, nobody is joining fight and i don't have 10k 5mm ammo per one try....
---
Banjo heard that in WWII America sent China explosive material disguised as flour to fight the Japanese. Thing was it was also edible. So the Chinese had choose between very carefully cooking with it, or blow some peoples up
---
I honestly want to know as well. What I do know is the description says it lasts two minutes, and I am told each player can contribute... so every player doing the syringer on the queen every two minutes should theoretically make the queen fight be shorter.
---
She supposedly has 70% DR (in addition to base 300? ballistic + energy resist). So 3 characters doing syringer should be very helpful, if you can convince one of your buddies to use it too.
---
That said, I find the SBQ fights too short. I actually want it to last longer (unless I'm having trouble), as I like to farm the adds, with the increased spawnrate in the event and 2x legendary rate in the blast zone (I lure the queen away from V9 and Delta, and into the blast zone).
---
I only pull those out if there's less than 10 minutes left on the clock, and her health is still high which is unlikely.
---
If you use the left and right arms in tandem it's not double the ore it is actually four times the ore per time you mind that node. however it does not apply for some of the other or types but it will mostly apply for the more common types of ore
---
A bloodied explosive lever gun. Not sure what the 3rd one would be
---
And this is why we need to stop asking bethesda to break the lore for us.
---
Bear Arms makes the 50 Cal weigh nothing, and speed demon makes reload nothing... I feel a better combo on the weapon would be Bloodied/AA/Furious with Explosive and damage resistance while aiming. Alternatively damage resistance when aiming, but I personally prefer the former because I can give myself a decent buff just by aiming instead of having a higher buff by reloading, which only lasts a few seconds and is dependent on me not having a full clip.
---
Thank you!
---
No, but you can get grafton and penitenriar, or steel + dam + maybe clarksburg. Forget where clarksburg is off the top of my head-- if it is by monanga iirc then no.
---
\&gt; People might even not show up due to the location.
---
In my experience they show up once and forget about it, leaving you free to claim all the respawns later.
---
Furious, Swingspeed, +1 strength Mole Miner gauntlet.
---
I think they said on pax live that they wanted something like this, but that being said to solve this you would need to be locked to one server and no more hopping. 
---
You can't take one spot that is yours on all the servers, that would just be a madness of buildings everywhere. And waaaay to little map to be housing thousands of camps.
---
Yesterday i joined two cryptid events, which failed. So yeah it cost 2300 to get few steel from mr. gusties.
---
Also i did launch nuke on SBQ, if two guys didn't join me thru post on this reddit, i was alone whole time. after 30minutes of tons of ammo she flew away with 5% hp. 
---
I feel like those events with bulletsponge bosses are just waste of everything, but there is nothing else to do. I don't understand why people around the server didn't join fight.
---
I suck with links ... I Googled Fallout 76 News, and just read every article I could with anything about the future plans .... especially the after Wild Appalachia stuff.  Bethesda has released some info on future plans ... vault openings, new faction, and legendary player effects were the ones that caught my imagination.
---
Quad Explosive Crossbow with 15% faster reload. I don't care about the meta, I just want my magic crossbow. I've already got a one-star Quad Crossbow, so hopefully we'll be able to add stars to our existing weapons.
---
A weapon that allows you when using it to reduce your wieght to zero
---
Uh tangla town or what ever it is called in the mire has 100% spawns of cave crickets in it and counts as a cave.
---
I think if there's gonna be any entrance it'll be through the second elevator :)
---
Interesting, it implies the production of moonshine as it’s the most commonly used method for said production.
---
There’s a reason I only ever wear my Enclave Officer Uniform or the Space Suit.
---
Yes, we need more Rugged looking outfits. We also need more faction specific stuff for the atom shop. Where is my Enclave X01 paint? Where are Armor and weapon skins that actually look like they fit in the wasteland? I’m sick and tired of all the Vault Tec skins. We need more faction stuff. Brotherhood, Enclave, Responders and Free states paint for weapons and armor and power armor! Stuff like that! Stuff that would logically fit into the Post war universe!
---
I miss this from the past games, having our primary gun on our back.
---
I remember actually having to do something like this with some rpg in like 1995..
---
Ohhhhh ... I forgot +1 Strength for my melees .... swing speed is a must, but power hit can be replaced with +1 Str. .... I like the Mole Miner gauntlet too ... great power and sound effect.
---
Lol I hear ya. It wont be so bad if they do it like the new level up challenges. Have an option of 10 things to do and only required to fulfill 3 of them.
---
I can do silo in 10minutes, i wanted to farm SBQ, but people here refused to join me and i don't want to fight her alone.  For whitespring/herpes fery i don't nuke it because other players go there, kill your mobs and you have nice death place ....
---
There are multiple ways to go about managing your weight as a rifleman build. Step number one is to try and get the deep pocket mod for all of your armor. try to wear armor types that are moderately lighter than other types example no heavy combat armor try to stick to the lighter variants. If you get lucky enough try to get armor with a legendary prefix of reduced weapon carry weight. mostly because a lot of those rifles can weigh upwards of 20 to 25 lb each. If you're not using any of your strength points then try to dedicate as much of them to weight reduction perks as possible depending on how much strength you actually want to have on your character.
---
I was hoping the same .... adding stars that is ... my favourite melee right now is the one star inst. pole hook I have had since I turned level 40 .. I would love to amp it up with speed boost and +1 Str.
---
You could just do it whenever you want. It's kinda free exp and loot.
---
Hey I’m tough but not that tough :( unless I have something to jump on. Guess op builds have to be taken into consideration.
---
It was an idea, it doesn’t actually happen at the moment lol. Deathclaw island only spawns one at a time and it’s always low level, 23 I think?
---
A
---
Furious swing speed +strength combat knife.  Vampires might be cool too.  I have a 2 star suppressors with swing speed, literally can't pull the trigger fast enough
---
For armor, Vanguard's Sentinel with fall dmg reduction.  I have one piece, 1 more would round out my armor set pretty well.
---
I want more raider items!y shrine in my camp needs more bone-related objects and 10 bone chimes isnt enough
---
Bethesda add a whole new species or 2 to kill please lol
---
Yeah .. Perk Cards change stuff .... I prefer to use the Str for more % points of fire power than carry weight which can be covered with armour legendaries weight redux and the 90% on the weapon itself.  Bloodied doesn't work for me ... I freak out when my health dips below half.
---
Most of these events go well for me. I had someone run across the the area, one side to the other to revive me because I don’t usually take the pylons and I forgot about the health drain after a while.
---
That would work great for me.
---
IGN VvtheDuke33 lv 181 add me ;))
---
I’ve been running a HW/Explosives build since launch, it’s insane. I still haven’t gotten my hands on a BE 50cal though... dream gun for sure. B25 Gatling would be my dream everyday kickabout Gun; I’ve got an Instigating 25 gat though, it’s a damn close second.
---
Also your math might not be including the heavy barrel mod for the 50cal? Adds a little damage.
---
except for when they made the burrows
---
I'm person would love to find a quad explosive light machine gun. Maybe even a vampire's explosive reload speed minigun.
---
Alternatively I would love to see some legendary power armor coming to play. I'd be content if it was even just one star legendary power armor.
---
I believe it’s non PA raider armor
---
Got a drill when I kited a 2 Star legendary mob around the SBQ while doing the follow me emote so everyone could tag it. No good deed goes unpunished I guess.
---
I thought about using OCR, but I figured it would be more of a hassle then typing to try and setup the parameters so it only pulled the list name and attributes and nothing else.
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to respond—really appreciate it! This is great info. I'm on PS4 (alas!) otherwise I'd take you up on your offer.
---
Side Bar .... why can't Power Fists be worn with Power Armour?
---
Seems like a no brainer to me, and an obvious "Bracer" type of mod.
---
There are any new players? O.o
---
Few people start the fight but man do people swarm in when someone does. Over the last two weeks I’ve nuked site prime at least 30 times to get all the prime receivers and every time at least 10 people showed up. Haven’t failed it once. Just check the map for lots of high levels before nuking.
---
I don’t do it for the legendaries, they suck. But there’s a guaranteed prime receiver plan you don’t have unless you know them all, jet pack plans to sell and all the exp if you do some general mob clearing during the fight, which I do to prove adrenaline anyway.
---
I love the military fatigues, but I don’t like seeing my armor atop it, so I understand the sentiment. I always end up wearing my vault suit because I don’t know of any armor mods for the fatigues either.
---
Who else thinks they should introduce a new species or 2 in to the fallout world? Scortched super mutants or something or a whole new species itself
---
I can craft a targeting helmet for the x-01. I can prove it if with pics if you want, I don’t have the actual mod itself. Just the crafting option.
---
real question is which fuckin clown at Bethesda keeps putting the challenges there days after they’ve known about the bug
---
It still seems I use more ammo than I can make from doing it
---
I'll start looking into it. Won't be able to get it done until a fter the patch at least though because who knows what they will change
---
I swear every time I create a new character I meet someone who wants to help me cause they think I’m new. The 76 community is so wholesome.
---
Same here. I give away all my duplicates. I also workshop/event regularly so they build up. 
---
I could sell them but wheres the fun in that?
---
Mods are broken, hopefully only until tomorrows patch.
---
Why fuck with other people?
---
On a another reddit thread they said there should be a dead merchant somewhere and somehow the death claw got the name tag. I've already seen it
---
You don't get xp but they do get the loot from the enimies that spawn when new people show up
---
Yeah, I love the look of the marine wetsuit, but unless you want to wander around with no armor, it's always hidden from sight. Maybe if they included a jacket-only outfit without accompanying trousers - that would be great.
---
Good for you. A typical cowardly bully that is too afraid to go to survival. Because he knows he will get beaten to pulp over and over and over by the real pvp'ers.
---
It might have been Bethesda games. You think Fallout 76's launch was rough, both Arena and Daggerfall were so buggy on launch you couldn't actually beat the game till the first patch came out.
---
i still think griefing is wrong and the system as it is should be tweaked but what im saying is that this sub blows it into a way bigger issue than it actually is. dude comes in and starts shooting your wall, and if for some reason you don’t immediately take the hint and server hop, the worst case scenario is that you spend some steel, aluminum and rubber on repairs.
---
Oh wow! Thanks
---
It's almost definitely an automated system, and these challenges were added to a calendar weeks ago in advance.
---
I have social anxiety and wouldn't be able to do this.
---
I love this.
---
I also love living in The Mire.
---
the ticks can go to hell though
---
This makes sense based on my experience, but can I ask your source?
---
Assuming the item wasnt sold to the vendor by another player, my understanding is that items originating from the vendor are instanced.
---
because mmo
---
I use the auto on mine and use my handmade for the queen for the dps.
---
Uh last time I checked uncanny caverns wasn't in Tangla town.
---
There are some that are instanced, but you can view what others have sold. 
---
Instanced ones are unique to you, what other have sold everyone sees and can buy (first in first served for it)
---
for 5k caps you can buy some TSE
---
I got a Quad crossbow with limb damage :)
---
The challenge says in a cave, and tangla town counts as a cave. I got the challenge completed there.
---
one heavy laser turret and they are just free stimpacks.
---
Thank your Bethesda for F@#%ing the game up even more.  PvP'ers aren't happy with the survival server and PvE'ers are unhappy because they're being griefed by unhappy PvP'ers. 
---
So let's recap:
---
Don't claim workshops
---
Don't team up
---
Don't fight the Queen or Sheepsquatch unless you want a one star lead pipe with faster reload speed, another Explosive vent plan and a white wolf fedora.
---
Don't bother with the Burrows, because the gumby Boss Assaultron doesn't drop legendaries and can be killed with a wet noodle
---
Don't build around a weapon that might be later tagged OP, because it will be nerfed and you'll have to start a new toon. (It may take twice as many levels to re-spec)
---
.....The Don't list is gonna be VERY long, is there a thread where we can keep track of them all? 
---
Maybe a "Do" list might be shorter.  Let's see.
---
Do: Sit in a chair in your camp "in Passive mode", with Homebody and give all your caps to your low level loot mule, grow some corn for soup and enjoy Fo76. Woohoo Fun times!
---
Do: Find enough mats to repair said chair when a mob scorched beast or sad PvP'ers come and wreck it.
---
Do: Get outside and play RL games , like the kids in  Simpsons Season 2 Episode 9 "Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge" . Notice Itchy and Scratchy in their CAMP rocking chairs, drinking Lemonade, (they must have found the plans). The producers edited out the part where roving disgruntled PvP'ers griefed them and stole their caps and lemonade. 
---
Do: Remember FoNV "it just worked".
---
Wow, what a toxic post. Starting to think it's the other way around. My sympathies. Anyway, if someone decides to do some spring cleaning in your camp, just move it, it will be blue printed and your structures will be safe.
---
Every second or third server I join has someone coming out of the vault and every server I join has a few low levels in Flatwoods.
---
Cuz then youd be a .... Power Ranger!
---
Mine is almost the same but have 3 strength and 2 in chr, 14 in luck
---
Yeah mostly scorched and the turrets in silos.
---
If you don't use energy weapons yourself, yeah. The only negative side effect is a decrease to your energy weapon damage while you get a bonus to your energy defense. As a huge percent of creatures use energy weapons, it's a great way to protect yourself against them.
---
What platform is this guy playing on?
---
Browsing the ESM with FO76Edit. Oddly enough, the damage and rad reduction abilities are attached to the paint, although they don't seem to vary with paint job.
---
Two Shot aren't really two shot.
---
More like 2 bullets - one shot w/ very small bonus as second bullet only does 20% extra damage (or less), which can't get through the armour of any level 35 or higher baddie. 
---
Or rather ... throwing a second bullet into the dumpster with every shot fired, so you need to spend twice as much time scrounging for steal, lead and gunpowder to feed the beast.
---
You got their wrong directly in front of getting there right, then got their wrong again. Impressive.
---
Cool, i have 13 keycards, but people on PS4 won't join you. So i was fighting one queen with two guys that was so gold, they joined me via post here.
---
This SBQ had three players for price of one. (she flew away with 5%hps)
---
Man what a twist it would be to finally have an NPC human in the game but for it to be Indrid instead... It would be the perfect set up for something ominous and creepy, and perfectly in line with Bethesda's love for aliens
---
Alrighty, thank you
---
It just keeps getting better. Sorry you missed fastnacht
---
In this particular case, it was a locked container that WASN'T a stash; it looked like any other environmental little footlocker in a building. This was at a workshop, so other than a few resource extractors (which weren't locked) and a very obviously player-placed workbench, everything was or appeared to be normally occurring loot boxes. But I guess you can't unlock anything within a workshop that is owned by another player without getting a bounty.
---
Either that or legit all this guy had was a tin can and a can of dog food, because that's all that was in the container and if he placed it, it was his whole stash.
---
I thought I'd struck a gold mine the first time I found a workshop. Resource generators everywhere just churning out junk. All kinds of benches, it was perfect. Purified water too. 
---
Workshop owner showed up and murdered me, then I figured it out.
---
I use calibrated shocks, optimized bracers and honestly don't know what I have on the helmet.  I dislike the targeting HUD effect, so I don't use that.  Possibly just the sensor array.
---
Literally every part of the game can be soloed with the right build. For people who don’t have super crazy weapons, armour and a perfect bloodied build, well they can solo everything except the SBQ. Including the imposter sheepsquatch if you have the meds and aren’t a derp.
---
Wuz wrong w'that? ....
---
This.
---
Will anything be unnecessarily nerfed?
---
It only uses 1 round per shot
---
I would have loved to see whatever happened while i was gone, but there were things that needed my attention in life. My health is my main focus. My school came next. Even though i got about 5.5 more weeks im feel like im in a good place.
---
Apparently you can still get them from scrapping, but it is an extremely low chance. 
---
Better off trying to find the plans.
---
Each zone is targeted for different levels, Forest is beginner, Ash Heap and Toxic Valley are mid, Savage Valley goes up, Mire and Bog are high level zones.
---
Forgot this one ... I have a Hunter's Combat knife w/ speed bonus and power attack ... kills anything on four or more legs while not giving them a chance to even breath.
---
Have to shot handmade. 3 star
---
Military Fatigues and Bos Fatigues dont really go well with any armor so theres really no use for them as under armor, but they would look really nice as an outfit
---
Game has only been out 6 months...give Bugtesda time 😂
---
Exactly.
---
Lol, too lazy to correct it, but I noticed as soon as I saw too. Like then and than *shudders*
---
TS does a bit more damage (+36% vs +29%) if you actually hit with both projectiles, but it has a substantial accuracy penalty (2.5x worse accuracy, IIRC).
---
Bloodied swing speed machete
---
Unfortunately no, it don't.
---
*Doubt
---
Probably didn't have a cap on him.   Get the kill for 0 caps
---
Same. I didnt have enough wood and couldn't be bothered to grab some just for my walls
---
Not really. Any loser can get a 5k bounty for staring at a base and clicking buttons.
---
I spent 2 hours server hopping at whitesprings the other day and got to kill exactly 0 golfer ghouls.
---
You won’t get that though. He would’ve been broke and just gotten a 4 hour player damage penalty.
---
Why blame other players when Bethesda put it in the game? Im dont pvp in any way but just wondering
---
Feel good. That’s worth the trade off.
---
Many mutations, class freak and strange in numbers don't work together well. It has been mentioned in multiple posts (that get little to no visibility, as you shall see with yours). I have yet to see an official response from Beth about those. I think the issue was acknowledged once in a post a long time ago by a community manager but that's pretty much it as far as I know. All you can do is submit the bug through customer support and wait. Frankly, these mutation bugs have been the worst part of 76 for me.
---
&gt; no idea the Enclave or MODUS existed, so far as I know. The closest they get to a reference is when Taggerdy's terminal mentions Senator Blackwell's mysterious vanishing. But yes, counter faction quests would be interesting.
---
The brotherhood that now exist, like those of us picking up the banner after leaving the vault do know.
---
If you haven't seen it, probably a reference to [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZHoHaAYHq8)
---
We dont have enough colors yet. We got yellow, white, black, silver, blue, and red. We need green
---
When i get home im gona give it to you, when this comment is 9 hours old reply here
---
So I'm better off the majority of the time with the AA?
---
I wish we had more than 15 points max per special
---
Wood, steel, circuits, oil, gears and more. Don’t forget all that flux if you have a decontamination shower. Then there’s the fruit you have to go find if they get your garden (or scrap and redraft each plant individually). Losing all those resources, especially the flux, is annoying when the other person gets no gain out of being a cunt. It might be virtual stuff but it takes real time to get it, so no shame in being pissed at losing it.
---
Also, if you’re going to act like a cunt people are going to call you a cunt. Online and in real life.
---
Read it again.
---
Not very toxic really, considering. And moving your camp twice costs a small chunk of caps. Not something someone should have to do to get around a griefer.
---
Yeah it worked for me. It repairs what it could not everything
---
You sure about this?  Two shot = Two bullets ... No?
---
What are the perks and lvl? What price you were thinking?
---
Bases are getting made invulnerable unless pvp is declared on both sides. Won’t be long now.
---
10% more damage to players, 50% more damage in VATS, +1 perception. Taking offers for now
---
I’m sure I have a TSE handmade and it only uses 1 bullet but fires 2
---
We're not extinct. There's just nothing left for us to control... Well not much at least.
---
Yup still broken. Sometimes works but mostly doesn't. Don't know if they are aware. Ani-armor legendary doesn't work on energy weapon from what I've been told.
---
Yep. A few days ago after successfully killing the Scorchbeast Queen, I went back to my camp to take care of a few things and log out... and noticed that my Excavator PA Helmet didn't appear to be there... I checked the frame and nope - no helmet. It was late and I didn't feel like swapping around perk cards to fix it, so I logged out for the night.  
---
The next day when I logged in, I still had the PA on... and the helmet was still gone. I swapped out perk cards and built a new helmet... then noticed I was suddenly missing a right leg. Odd.  
---
I built a new right leg... but then I had two on the frame-- one with calibrated shocks, one without. I scrapped the one without (yes, I'm sure)... and then I had one right leg... but without calibrated shocks.  
---
Soooo.... I had to add the calibrated shocks again (using more violet flux - grr).  
---
All my PA parts on all my sets (x-01, excavator, &amp; ultracite) seem to be there now, but that was very very strange. I've not had the parts disappear until this 2-day incident not long after the last patch.
---
Unless you're always aiming down sights at close-ish targets, yes. Two-shot has a possible (untested) advantage that it stacks better with Explosive, but a plain two-shot isn't great anymore.
---
100-120 violet flux around fissure site prime if you nuke down and a little to the left of the drop zone and with prime in the top right of the circle. You also get SBQ fight.
---
Apparently harpers ferry with the burrows is good for that too.
---
Why should the person minding their own business have to leave?
---
Cool well good luck the perks aren't what I was looking for
---
The drill, syringer and flaregun can replace the legendary drop. Not sure if It's intentional or not but I've had this occur many times.
---
The only thing running the enclave seems to be a few people in DC from FO3, and robots. No real mention of the enclave in NV or FO4 that I can recall.
---
They didn't do in in 4 because of all the different mods would need different models. 76 would be worse.
---
I've already got most of the prime receivers unlocked and some serums and PA and mod plans, knowing the loot is guaranteed to suck, I still participate it from time to time just to try different weapons and techniques. Recently I've farmed and crafted dozens of plasma cores so I plan to try gatling plasma on SBQ next time. But some players said if you melt the queen with energy weapons mid air she will teleport to her spawn and can't be looted, so I need to be extra careful lol
---
It's not worth the resources and effort.
---
There are two legendary armor abilities with the name "+25 Radiation Resistance". The other one is actually disease resistance, but it has the wrong name.
---
Why does everyone freak out about finding grahm? I’ve found him a few times including once  yesterday and he was pretty lacklustre. Had nothing special that I could see. I assume he has a special plan?
---
I just want some clean underwear!
---
I had a TS Combat lvl 20 before the nerfing .... It went through bullets like crazy, and only had half the life expectancy of an AA lvl 40 I had for comparison .... the TS was superior though 20 lvls down and worth the extra work.
---
Then the nerfing made the TS a worthless hunk of junk ... and I gave up on TS .... might they have reduced the ammo expenditure with the nerf?  That would make sense.
---
A great place to start then, thank you kindly.
---
Couldnt agree more! Crazy stuff is fine like I use to put Fashnacht mask and straight jacket running around on mic pretending that I am digging nice hole in the ground😛, however I wouldnt mind something a bit more serious, postapocalyptic wise. Shame that gas masks give -2 to Perception otherwise it would be one of the main things I would stick on my character.
---
So i bought the game two days ago and people launched 3 nukes back to back during my first 4 hours of play time, pretty wild.
---
That and use a tesla rifle to tag as many as possible and boom easy xp.
---
So you can sell them to vendors more than you can sell them to players? Why do people sell them to players then?
---
Oh, that's good to know. Does it function as a disease resistance? Like if I look at it in stats it will show up?
---
Just tested it incase it actually did count those crickets, it doesn't.
---
Extra caps after you hit your daily limit.
---
In fact loser is exactly what they are.
---
I have it and I like it.
---
Next update, no more camp damage! Woooo!!!
---
The anti-armor kinda makes sense, but there should just be another legendary effect for energy that cuts energy resistance.
---
200 caps to replace your camp isnt that bad. And if someone is frustrated to the point that they're insulting the nature of the person's upbringing, that's toxic. They may want to consider another game. I've never played it, but I would guess 'my little pony island adventure' would be more suitable for them.
---
On the griefing note, it's a game. People roleplay. I myself roleplay as the Mysterious Maid. I'll show up randomly and clean your camp. And I assure you I'll leave it spotless! Floors are stubborn but walls clean up pretty quick. And that big fusion generator? When I'm done with it you wont even notice it's there.
---
Anyway, be safe out there, the wasteland is dangerous and full of jerks.
---
I had a level 120+ give me a full excavator power armor set despite running a shop at the same time. All I was asking around for was someone to craft me a lever action rifle lol.
---
I got a Brotherhood outfit with the witch mask on. Looking sexy.
---
Sidenote: Im a level 29 who still has no cule what hes doing.
---
How does the Bloodied explosive or fire rate handmade compare to the 50?
---
&gt;Do people appreciate add clearing and reviving in the SBQ fight even if it's a lower level doing it?
---
Probably not. Not that it matters, I think.
---
Is it's useful? No, I don't think much so. Players who die too much, aren't likely good or strong. Level 45 and 200 have roughtly same health, can roughly have the same degree of PA. Main difference between two, is latter has far likely much much better weapons, and you can't reach level 200 by being totally clueless about the game mechancs. Most level 45 players by now, shoudl also not, because the exp comes much slower.
---
Initially I wrote a longer answer, but I'll keep it short: Is it better or worse, if they are some low levels around? I can't say. Low and mid level (players) can have some advantages that they bring to the event, but each player also causes the SBQ to be stronger. Most of the SBQ aids aren't really powerful and particular threat to any high levels who can deal a lot of damage. The ones that are, are also significantly
---
Go to stairs, go to the bottom of the stair options for a support beam.
---
The building mechanics suck and it’s weird they haven’t been fixed yet. I’m constantly having to build walls and floors I don’t want or need so I can build other walls or floors, then I have to store or scrap the walls and floors I used to build the walls and floors I wanted. It’s awkward and silly.
---
Yeah. Granted most of them could be alts / mules or whatever but I see people leaving the vault frequently enough.
---
On the alternate side of this, my level 100+ friend and myself stumbled upon a really well made camp that was obviously made by a lower level player and we were wandering around it, talking about how great it was and the location and stuff, when it disappeared.  Guess the guy saw a couple of higher level people and didnt want to lose his work.  I mean, I get it, but it's a shame we can't show off our camps for fear of them being annihilated.
---
You do with some. Can’t craft certain mods or turrets without certain perks.
---
I have marine armor and then one of the encl ave mask (grey one) looks nice
---
Wonder if this is where we'll get a new side quest for the beer keg plan.
---
Here is the path that I took, which wasn’t filled with high level enemies: Vault 76/Forest, Flatwoods, Morgantown, Grafton/Toxic Valley, worked my way down the entire left side of the map, Ash Heap, and right now I’m finishing up to go up the Savage Divide, go right to the top of the Mire, and finally work my way down the Cranberry Bog
---
Jesus Christ that’s fucking terrible. Imagine scrapping an x-01 torso with jet pack. If Bethesda isn’t going to get their shit together, they need to replace items when there lost because of their screw ups. Why should someone lose all the time it takes to find a jet pack because Bethesda fucked up a patch?
---
Yeah. I got that too. I just creep on people with my cultist outfit and mask.
---
I like having 1, 2 and 3 star perks. It gives me more options when I'm making new builds. Maybe what they could do to prevent mess is make it that you can toggle the stars up and down on the card as long as they're ranked up.
---
Do you still need this?
---
all i see these days are "Bethesda", please (xyz)"
---
heh
---
I have 7k ultracite 50 cal ammo I'll see ya :) I made it and never use it.
---
no benefit to do it,
---
i can tell you I personally dropped like 6 nukes on the weekend and 2 queen, 4 WS.
---
2 nukes on the queen ppl showed up but none help, they just tagged the queen 
---
WS was blah not many legend spawned, not to mention the BS drops when they do show up.
---
long story short, ppl just want to freeload the rewards, and the rewards from dropping a Nuke are not the same as before.
---
Agreed.
---
Be nice if I could temper my marine armor
---
Camp immunity next update :)
---
I don't know the numbers, but my Anti-Armour Explosive Handmade tears through armoured enemies like Super Mutants and Robots, but struggles with unarmoured enemies like Scorched and Wolves. 
---
Armoured enemies are usually harder, so works out well. 
---
It's just annoying killing wolves!!
---
The Fallout community is very nice and helpful never saw this an other game.
---
Yeah now that you mention it. This random encounter could very well be the sheepsquach's trail.
---
Yessir, tomorrow though. I'm Pacific timezone.
---
Except that was the most duped gun of the dupers era.
---
How do you get 400? I only get 250 or so. With excavator.
---
Iv seen some level 400+ but that was before the ban hammer fell. 
---
Its nice to be able to use and switch up you special stats as well i have moved a few points around cause why not you can always put it back right.
---
But after that point its more or less how you wanna play the game Survival, building, roleplaying or pvp its all on how you look and veiw the game and what you do with it.
---
Agree, I would love to get the New Vegas Raider outfits
---
4x the ore bro not 2x.
---
Platform?  If Xbox I'll make you one if you have the materials.  If not, I get 450 each from the vendors so 450.  I'd also trade, and will take any waste acid you have and plans I don't know.
---
The mongrels and mole rats in Fallout 4 can't munch on turrets 5+ meters off the ground, whereas the ones in 76 do so regularly and often. The turrets in 4 are also smarter than the ones in 76. ;)
---
Well isn't gauss rifle like that?
---
Your still better off not getting rank 2/3.  Get more crit chance or more crit damage.  or Sandman for higher damage, ect.  There are numerous other perks that offer more damage than rank 2/3 can provide.
---
And about other under armor, you can buy shielded versions of all kind under 1k a piece.
---
I added my idea too in OP, go read it if you like it.
---
Full set of Heavy Vangard Metal Armor, rad resist on 4 peices (1,having ap regen), with increased durability on limbs and -50% fall damage on chest.
---
I'd like to see the sales for the Toybox P.A vs the Bone Raider P.A
---
( Note: I own both - I used free atoms for Toybox, and actually bought atoms for Bone Raider )
---
Other than the camera and bug fixes, what else?
---
They have lots of iron, very healthy!
---
&gt;Bring back every weapon from previous fallout titles. Wacky weapons are like half the fun of borderlands, why not do it here? (Shout out to wacky weapons workshop mod from Fo4).
---
Aha. Then what? Do you realize this game needs to be playable for years? Suppose they do exactly as what you suggest. 
---
NOW!
---
SO what they bring 6 months from NOW? 12 months? 24 months? All the "new" content we've had so far, HAS BEEN, in MAKING, already prior to the games launch.
---
If you actually think about it, do you think they won't bring new weapons?
---
That would be great for the AM mode.
---
1750 if you have lots of charisma boosting stuff but 19xx if you have 4 charisma and hard bargain 3 like most people.
---
20 or 15 lead? 
---
Dude spent all that time and effort trying to shake you two down for that small an amount of lead? He could have spent the same amount of time hitting up any one of the weightlifting gyms or scrounging up a few cans of colored paint (yellow paint, blue paint, etc) in the vicinity of Flatwoods in less time than he wasted attempting this. 
---
3 cans of blue paint: 15 bottle caps. 
---
1 claimed workshop: 25 bottle caps. 
---
Utter failure at an in-game Raider racket: Priceless. 
---
For everything else, there's Blastercard.
---
This ^^ is how legends are born.
---
Yea I will certainly buy atoms to get the skins I like, now  I don’t know where I can spend those atoms. I would like to have different skins for variants of the same weapon, say a red camo for bloodied explosive pump shotty and a green camo for a non-explosive shotty, so i can easily tell which is which and won’t blow myself up in tight spaces. Right now everything looks the same which is not just boring but inconvenient when there’s so many variants of a same weapon.
---
Matte black is my favourite colour. Matte black and matte red are my favourite combination and when I have the cash I’ll be painting my car those colours. I’d love it for PA.
---
Hard bargain 3 and grape mentats put you at the maximum price reduction.  Dissolve one tab under your tongue before buying expensive plans, or key cards.  :)
---
Isn't it all a bit beige?
---
I thought it would be a pet deathclaw :(
---
You have to go to social to join your friends...
---
Oh I did not know.   I never went back to get the stims though except once.  Did not even know it was exploit?  Thought it was just an extended reward thing?  Never really need stims, get too many.. I sell about half of them.
---
Making them is too difficult though, they need to make getting the stuff easier.
---
I wanna see you holster my Gatling gun,Gatling plasma at once lol 2 are allready to much if you got heavy guns but what about the lmg,50cal,cryolator harpoon gun and flamer and minigun that I also wear with me ? 
---
Maybe I could pull a truck with me and my weapons lol
---
To me 76 is a series of long and short term goals I set myself. Lord knows I'm know sticking around for the deep story and engaging characters.
---
(Though I love Biv. Bless your pickled brain.)
---
What system?
---
Totally well adjusted and successful in life ppl like to be jerks and dicks in online games, too, ya know?
---
I notice that White Powder is pretty much dead center on the map. It might be that that location is the default zero value for location.
---
I'm not sure nuking that spot would work the way you're hoping, but it's worth trying it out. It would for sure be a bug if it worked.
---
What locations near white powder should I try to include in the ring of destruction? Also, what are good locations besides silos to check after nuking?
---
Just a bunch of cunts egging each other on.
---
Also, unless you’re in survival or click the revenge option when respawning, they can’t keep killing you.
---
Live in the trees!
---
Theres so much possibilities to create clothing and apparel for the fallout universe but instead  they make those "clean" and "funny" outfits. 
---
I do understand that Fasnacht and easter type events and holidays should have approtriate costumes. But they should really focus on proper post apocalyptic wasteland type clothing and apparel when theres no special event.
---
And this recent deathclaw easter egg Bunny mascot head, while it was cool looking they couldve have made something related to deathclaws. Maybe some sort of deathclaw garb or something like the wildman rags but just Deathclaw themed.
---
It is a good game and I have had a lot of fun playing it! Possibly the most fun I've ever had playing an Online game before! 
---
I do recognise that it had a lot of issues early on though, and still has a lot of issues. But I have been able to see through a lot of these because I have enjoyed it. 
---
My advice? Play the game and you be the judge. And when you're about level 20 or so try to find a guild to connect with. 
---
There are lots out there - traders, Raiders, Brotherhood of Steel, Enclave etc etc.
---
Maybe the deathclaw was a travelling merchant. It's not the weirdest thing to happen in the Fallout universe.
---
As a person who could give a shit less about barbie dress-up cosmetics on video games, it was thoroughly disappointing. Items please. Not pointless "bunny masks"
---
And pouring them all over their word salad.
---
I'm more on the line of 5-10%
---
Yesterday got about 20 legendaries and out of those got one 3\* others were 1\* junk
---
Some are saying that it's server based so that some servers drop better loot and if you find a WS where you get 5+ leges on run, you should stay on that server and grind the usual locations. No idea if this is true, but have found lot's of legendaries that way.
---
TS is 25%.
---
Eat less carbs and do cardio.
---
25%.
---
No. One bullet. It’s magic.
---
you must have missed some..i do it with my team.and we always get 400 approx each..in one of the tunnels there is a hidden passage behind.some vines hanging..did you go through there?
---
Do a couple of Wolf horde quests in the forrest, u'll get a legendary item relative to your level, as you are lvl 24 the next quest is to get your mining PA, lvl25 quest .. And do the mistress of mystery quest aswell, XP a great quest and you get two weapons and a unique outfit. 
---
I usually carry knuckledusters for lower than me enemies as it will save on my ammo.
---
Also try to find a kind player that will craft you a level 30 The Fixer.
---
You can get lucky getting the Plan for The Fixer but the Encripted event is higher level, but if theres a few 'good' players there the Event will complete, just make sure you hit the Sheepsquatch for a legendary when it dies.
---
Stash - only keep what you need..
---
Most junk i keep about 50 of each - i don't need it.
---
Essentials i will keep more of - Springs , Steel , Screws,, etc etc.
---
Wood its so easy to obtain i only keep 100 for cooking - then if i want to rebuild CAMP or build a friends CAMP i run to..  Helvetia and Pickets Fort for wood and then Kawama Cemetry and the Monorail Elevator for Concrete ... ( you can get lots of lead at the Elevator too!! ) .
---
Tick Blood for Blood packs, Ticks spawn at the Lumber mill and the Mloonshiners shack just outside vault 76 - use butchers bounty to get more blood.
---
Dilute your stimpacks with chemist - an easy way to have plenty of stims early on.
---
Had the same issue tonight. Was able to get into Uncanny Caverns once after finding nothing but Radrats outside. Only found Kings inside so I server hopped. After that, kept crashing when trying to enter inside the caverns. Fortunately after some more hops I managed to find a lonely cricket outside that counted for the points. The game all ready feels so unstable I try to even finish a daily that manages to pop up instead of anything else in case of a crash and lose the daily. Not to even mention I haven't been able to even get a Mire daily to pop in weeks.
---
Also after over a dozen hops was only able to find 2 radscorpions and countless Honey Beasts and Mirelurk Queens I gave up on that one.
---
I agree, server hopping for dailies is a joke
---
Huge percent use energy weapons?
---
I think that is other way around and ballistic is more needed. Very few scorched or mutants use lasers and most use pipeguns, assault rifles and shotgun. All melee is ballistic.
---
Some creatures do have energy attack, but still their biggest hitters are melee/ballistic.
---
It only uses one round but visually fires two. It probably went through the same number of bullets as a max level non legendary, because a tse level 20 back then would’ve been about equal to it. It always uses one round only.
---
I remember the first nuke I went to at whitesprings before they nerfed the spawn rate and it was the hardest thing I'd done in 76. We basically had to camp in the buses due to non stop enemies. Ever since they toned it down I've found nukes to be boring. Add to that most areas dknt change at all when nuked and they're just pointless
---
Won't fix the crashing issue but I can tell you the cave crickets are outside in the giftshop area. Just server hop if they're not.
---
yes he will have different outfits and if you get someone to hold him for you while you jump out and back in he will have different outfits for you too
---
Yeah I’ve been through there. There has to be an area I’m missing, so I’ll definitely look for it, thanks. I’m usually trying to get enough steel to go with just the 250 lead ore I get anyway lol.
---
6. Faction flags. As you progress through the main story, one of the things you unlock as a reward at the end of each”chapter” is a flag you can put in your camp, either as a wall hanging or as an actual flag on a pole. The responders, free states, BoS, Raiders... all of them. Maybe you can even get paint jobs for them as well. Declare your allegiance! (Yes, I would definitely have the Responders... I like them, even though people probably think that they are the sappy starter-kit faction, or the Minutemen. The Free states are pretty cool too.)
---
Yes but excess duped guns were wiped by bethesda and everyone who had multiple only kept one, which most people would keep unless they had no interest in it. So they’re still worth a bit. And 15% faster reload is a good third roll for a TSE.
---
With invulnerable camps, this is going to be an issue.
---
What, not during a radstorm? Hardly a challenge then is it.
---
Agreed. Like, an Easter-themed recipe with a decent buff? Or a carrot skin for the alien blaster pistol? Or plans for Egg bomb grenades? Those could be fun.
---
You're probably right about the int affecting it. I look forward to getting a prime receiver for my furious Gatling laser so I can see what a 113 durability Ultracite fusion core with power user looks like on ammo capacity.
---
I'm hopeful, given that a regular 100 fusion core has 999 shots.
---
Yeah just shoot until it’s at around 5% health and leg everyone else finish it off. The issue is that she turns into a goo pile up in the air.
---
Cool. Thanks. Ill be here for one hour after this post. Anyone can come by
---
If someone were to perhaps know that trick, make their way in and litter the place with mines ... would that be cheating ? 
---
&lt;insert innocent face icon here&gt;
---
what weapon and effects?
---
lol..i get good steel.from uranium fever..pick.up everything and put scrapper on...iv walked out of there with 900 steel..iv also walked out with 100. its hit and miss..its the acid i find a problem
---
I'm in the same boat as OP, what's fastnacht?
---
Mods would be awesome I just love the lmg
---
They’re colloquially known as cancer bats for a reason. Epilepsy attack inducing, screeching, attention demanding pieces of shit.
---
Is it a machetes
---
Keep up the good work, I’ve tried to figure out how to decode the launch codes and it’s way beyond me,
---
Rolling pin!
---
yeah it a waist off a card right now, it used to work ( at least I could seen myself and teamate jump higher but now it doesnt do jack.
---
really just depends on the effects, right now a four star is just a three star with a specific mod (scorched killer receiver for rifles or sacrificial blade for machete)
---
No a combat rifle
---
AI don’t run unless the server is wonky and I think turrets are far too weak and squishy tot ale on a scorchbeast. Maybe 10 rocket turrets if it doesn’t move around too much.
---
Stay in the Forest area and explore everything there. After that head to Toxic area and explore everything there. That should get you to 30+. But explore and don't try to go through main story until 40+
---
Problem is that if any higher level character has been around the game boosts enemies to match that character. And all other three areas have level cap of 100, meaning most enemies will be boosted to their highest level.
---
Melee helps as you don't need ammo and repair is easy, but start planning on your perk build ahead and don't take only QoL perks but damage perks also. Stick to one ranged weapon type (pistol, rifle, automatic, heavy) for starters and only take lvl 1 of each perk (lvl 1 gives +10% while higher levels give +5%). Bloody Mess is +15% damage boost on everything (at perk lvl 3). 
---
Always check cash registers next to vendors. Many players drop unwanted ammo and stuff there for others to use.
---
That's overkill. The most you'll get is 25% of list price. So CHA 6 in my case with Hard Bargain and Grape Mentats.
---
I stopped doing them because every single time, higher levels would hover around me and then swarm my body to wait for my junk to drop so they could take it. I do a lot of building and crafting, so my stash is always full, and I carry a good amount of junk. Guess I just can't do stuff like this with a character like that.
---
Yeah, that would be pretty amazing as a time saver actually.
---
I have been on the fence about using SFE given that Bethesda has been strictly enforcing the fun per hour limit (so to speak) since January and has a history of 'you have been suspended and I want to hear nothing about it' but for this I might risk it.
---
A special event that only lasted a week. There were a bunch of cosmetic drops and people complained that the super rare ones didn’t drop enough. Banjo thinks it will come back though.
---
I really want cannibal themed clothing, human leather jacket (has a few faces on it), human teeth ring, skull mask/helmet, blood warpaint, finger/ear necklace.
---
Be helpful if you told us the gun and effects. Guns values are not just determined by the amount of stars.
---
You know what, you're right. I completely forgot about wearing a bright pink sun hat while wearing 2076 sunglasses and a vampire costume in Fallout 4. My sincerest apologies learned sir.
---
They're attached to the paint because those values could change with the paint in Fallout 4.
---
Yah got me, writing this from my crib right now.
---
Oh fair enough, thanks
---
Explosive, more damage to schorched and a few others that I cant remember rn.
---
Also the ability to do something with duplicate cards that are cluttering my perk inventory.
---
Lever, guess, hunting don’t have any automatic receivers. Might be others I’m not thinking of.
---
Self-realization is the first step in the path to enlightenment..,and the path to leaving others’ bases alone.  Recognize that to some....it’s all about the base.
---
Don't claim a workshop and don't accept random team requests and you should be fine. 
---
Griefers like Adventure more because it takes too long to track players in Survival. 
---
Also, join a guild. If you are getting griefed call for backup!
---
Yeah i mean in the vidso the leg that goes is a calibrated leg so that 1 expensive item gone strait off, im personally not too fussed about losing these as im high level and play with many other high levels so we can replace this gear, but to a solo mid level player these losses can be quite substantial
---
That’s... really awkward. I hate when that happens in games.
---
My natural CHA is 1 and I can still share teir 3 perks when my health is low. So I’m not experiencing this issue.
---
11 server hops and counting :/
---
It’s just glitchy. Sometimes it will hover above everyone for several minutes at a time as well. Be happy though, as sometimes she will go an entire fight with out landing and that fucking sucks.
---
This isnt just something I made up. They do run. Multiple servers. Tried tested true... No maybe about it. So no you don't need 10 and regardless of what you "think" they arent to weak. It was actually disappointing when i figured out that if I lured one within proximity of my camp ot would fly off.
---
T-60 paint as already mentioned. You can get a whole load of Brotherhood outfits and headgear too. Most are from delivering tech data or Thunder Mountain. The BOS hood ( Paladin Danse style ) is a random spawn at the ranger station in Cranberry bog or Appalachian Antiques.
---
 I'd recommend an ultracite automatic laser pistol for sidearm as you can still do reasonable damage without having all the guerrilla perks or using vats ( PA and vats are a bad mix as it eats fusion cores ).
---
Enclave sells it for like 400 caps I think, so probably 175-200
---
It did use to be around 40% 3-star items and only about 10% 2-star items from 3-star enemies, but nowadays its definitely not. Not sure if it was patch 8, the hotfix or somewhere in between but they seem to have switched the ratios of 2 and 3-star items dropping from 3-star enemies. 
---
I imagine it was always supposed to be like it is now, with 1-star items being the most common, followed by 2-star items and then 3-star as the rarest reward. Probably yet another 'bug' that took way too long to get noticed and fix. Problem is they took so much time that we've all gotten used to the old drop rates and now this 'fix' just feels like yet another major nerf to legendary farming.
---
railway rifle working with the vats card fix please
---
Unfortunately this is a cut quest. It was originally going to start when you checked the terminal at Sunday Brothers Cabin. There are 3 distillers outside and you would be creating moonshine and protecting the distillers from honeybeasts and yao guai. The quest has been marked as cut for as long as ive been datamining. Why these are still in the crafting for cooking i have no idea but the brewer's yeast can only be obtained through the quest itself.
---
Booooorrriiinnnnggg. Where's the thrill in running away? Posts like this honestly are what's killing the fucking game.
---
And people who call you toxic are correct, there is no right or wrong way to play the game. 
---
There is NOWHERE that states "Fallout 76 MUST be played as a co-op experience and PvP'ing is a ban able offence"
---
And to be honest, who gave you the right to dictate how/what someone else should be doing on the game? "If you don't play the game like me you're just a bitch" what? Do you actually realise how childish that sounds?
---
Spit the dummy out more jesus christ Fallout is full of little babies that shy away from a confrontation it's unreal.
---
Stay on Fallout 4 pal, where you ARE the ruler of the wasteland, in Appalachia, you're nothing.
---
I mean it is somewhat valuable with the explosive effect. Honestly the scorch killer receiver isn't really good and most people look down on it.
---
Thanks
---
me and my friend have had this problem for a while now, sometimes the perks unshare instantly or within less than a minute and it’s really frustrating to need to go back to perks and share the same perk over and over again several times. it probably came after the last patch or when the burrows released because it only became a problem not that long ago
---
Fixer looks the same to me ???
---
I too was shocked to find going on the Atomic Shop 6 times in 6 days didn't get me a tse handmade and a full set of sentinal. Ruined my Easter, it did.
---
Ok, but when your charisma changes, is the perk still shared? I can share perks fine, they just don't stay shared

Make it interesting and mix them. Sneak up and bash stuff with your rifle.
---
Spot on. I want more trashy but practical looking things or something similar but with a theme attached to it. 
---
That’s why I liked the starlet outfit. I could use the hat which is badass and mix it with the western duster for a cowboy look.
---
sfe just loads more functionality into the default scaleform stuff i think and allows the swfs to be able to access it. now if only i knew exactly what is enabled in sfe then i would just be able to write to a file. For now ill just have to make it so when you are in a container you can push a key to get an output of all the items in it in a popup textbox that you can copy everything from hopefully.
---
It's not an argument, just a speculation. Robots, super mutants, scorched all use energy weapons. I'm not sure about mole miners, but I believe I've seen one or two sporting a laser weapon as well. Sure scorched and super mutants use ballistic, melee, and unarmed, but some are known to fire lasers at you as well. So in that perspective, yes it's a huge percent as robots, scorched, and super mutants are the most common enemy in the game and all have a tendency to use energy weapons (robots use nothing but), not to mention the ability of players being able to use them too. Maybe I can argue that it's about even as far as ballistic versus energy goes since the non robot humanoids can use either, but it's still a good percentage of the games enemies with the tendency to use energy weapons. So yes, Grounded is a good mutation to help protect against robots and other potential energy weapon wielding enemy.
---
Thank you, that terminal felt like something was cut, the guys like I got a great recipe, and I’ve adjusted it to work after the war... and then it’s over he never gives you anything, and there is so much around it.   So was it cut in favor of biv, or is this something else entirely?
---
Inspired me to make my own crappier version
---
Huh, Bethesda fixed this issue with sharing being knocked out when you get debuffed in the last patch.
---
As long as your base charisma is high enough without unyielding, though should be fine.
---
Though I wouldn't be surprised if there was a newer bug now. That's just how the Bethesda do.
---
The radius you can build up or down is the same as it is side to side, so if you put your camp on an elevated surface (cliff or existing building/structure) you can build 8-9 stories.. But you'll max your budget quick
---
How'd you get the plan? I presume trade. Else you're a naughty duck.
---
They were only obtainable before the patch around Christmas, and only in the dev cells. Similar to the Atom Cats paint.
---
I read somewhere, that it also might be related to   the Herd mentality Mutation.
---
I don't  run bloodied, I don't Change anything really ( except for perk Card Game depending in the Situation) and I have that Problem, too.
---
But not _all_ the time. Checked illnesses or withdrawel effects - nope.
---
Yeah...I have chr of 6 and temporarely it's fairly easy to boost it by 3 more. So stock I can share team medic 2. Of course I have the other medic perk, usually level 2, so it would further boost the healing. In the past I've used the shared team medic and my own medic perk, using diluted stims while Im at full health, just to passively heal some melee teammate.
---
It would of course work a heck better if I could tank or also would have good melee to use, but I use explosive guns so I don't generally take much damage, particurly if there's other players near. The medic is really great and I really wonder why people aren't using it much, at low level it's one of the perks you nearly need to take, as you got nothing better, so most people should have at least in past known about it. Medic 2 or 3 make diluted stims heal up a lot, so most of the time I'm using just diluted stims. That, together with chemist and super duper, will mean one stimpack actually becomes 4.6 diluted, and that's s alot of healing. So I'm very rarely low on stims, while I can gradually sell them. I think the sales are going to boom once the vending machines comes.
---
It's just last month or two, it's become really difficult to get any random to team up. On my level 170+ main I don't care about few special points not really useful, and extra perk cards here and there, I have levels 1-3 cards for many max 3 level cards anyway just so I can make minor adjustments on the fly.
---
Of course in the past not everyone has wanted to team up. Now it seems no one wants to. There's so much you could do. But just can't, anymore.
---
they are the ones that get recked on PvP so they try their luck on adventure. lol sorry asses thats all they are.
---
That's where I have my camp as well.
---
I'd consider it settled. I shot at them with both my Zealot's and Hunter's handmade and they died faster than when I shot them with Troubleshooter's.
---
I couldnt resist read that in Kellogs voice and it brought some fo4 memories.
---
Especially that sleep pod quest
---
Yaknow I can get down with that. To me, it's all about the bounty.
---
Nice!
---
At which point they should go into the negative.  Never spend another cap until the bounty is repaid.  Imagine how quickly all this stupid griefing crap would stop.
---
I’d upvote you more than once if I could. Need that NCR Veteran armour so damn bad
---
They improved them but the two shot and explosive effects are both going to increase the speed it breaks. Also check the size of the weapons health bar because if that's small it ain't going to last long.
---
Still need the Forrest?
---
Alt f4 not clear enough? Lol
---
Juicehead made a video on this on YouTube. Seems like the nerf was intentional. He showed the coding for the game.
---
They should have atleast made it a radbunny masc with all kinds of ghoulification
---
Use Weapon Artisan to repair it to 200% and the throw on Gunsmith to have it break slower.
---
Still 5K is a better reward that most of this game.
---
Already had both of those perks on, I think it might be the splitter mod, makes it shoot 4 lasers but it's 2 shot so 8 lasers per trigger pull
---
I just hope they dont forget that this is post nuclear war world we're explorind and not costume factory testing grounds
---
My perfect weapon and armour.. Hmmm..
---
Armour wise, probably some nice combat armour. I run team medic + anti-epidemic when I'm in a team and have literally hundreds of chems on me. So the minor modifiers that reduce their weight would be great. Maybe vanguard as major, since as I said, I do a lot of healing. We're always at max health.
---
🤔 Weapon.. Hmm.. Do instigating fat man exist? Because that shit would be hilarious.
---
not just PC, xbox its happening as well,
---
I like the game. I love the community (most of it)
---
Once again I say, Bethesda, if they don't have the caps to pay the bounty then make them go in the negative until it's paid off!
---
That could definitely be it. I also have a TSE Tesla &amp; I noticed it breaking a little faster with the shotgun mod attached.  Not as quickly as you're describing though. Maybe try that receiver out or just go back to the standard receiver.
---
I’m expecting a Burrows-nerf.... 😬 
---
I just hope they fix the mods and the ridiculous, sometimes several day long, respawn time for safes and ammo crates.
---
Probably the most recognisable name in punk, Sex Pistols, literally have a song called Anarchy in the UK. Punk is synonymous with anarchy. I think you are confusing anti-capitalism with socialism.
---
Double bump
---
I have to say people really do get themselves in a huge tissie about their camps.
---
It really is just virtual bullshit.
---
There’s not much difference between a camp and a Facebook farm.
---
Yeah I'll give that a shot, thanks
---
You only really need one point in Concentrated Fire and Gun Fu. Also, Class Freak isn't helping you at all, other than a bit of HP. 14 Luck is the threshold for a crit every third shot, there's a spreadsheet floating around about it. You can use those points to pick up some quality of life perks. You might also want to find a way to work in at least one point of Adrenaline, it makes a huge difference.
---
No problem. Hope it helps you out :)
---
So you can play how you want, but can’t post what you want? You realize how stupid this sounds right?
---
Because they are playing a Online action RPG with PvP elements.
---
Everyone knows you and your property can be damaged and what the consequences are in fo76.
---
Don’t like it then don’t play until they patch it.
---
I hate to break it to you mate, but some people are just assholes. 
---
Chances are they’re sad, pathetic little people in real life and doing this online anonymously makes them feel powerful for a change. 
---
Such is the online world. Hell, such is the real world as well, sadly. 
---
Is it a pain in the ass? Yep. 
---
But, it’s just something we all have have to put up with sometimes. 
---
Oh - and for anyone that wants to comment along the lines of “muhhhh but the game allows us to do this muhhhh legitzz pvp” - you are just as sad as the losers the OP is taking about.
---
OP - don’t let it get you down! Cheers.
---
There are some real douchebags out there, I've never had any problems with players until last night some randon guy started throwing artillery grenades in my camp. First thing I did was leaving the server and joining a new one..
---
most likely due to the addition of biv.
---
Small quiver pouch and a cannonball dispenser?
---
Rule everything you can out on your side, and then put a support ticket in. 
---
What platform are you on? How are you quitting the game? How soon after stashing/trading are you quitting? How stable is your internet connection?
---
Not saying it is something your end, but worth ruling it out.
---
Workshops are more hassle than they’re worth most of the time. It’s really the only area you can get cornered into pvp on an adventure server, and the guys on adventure that do that kind of thing probably got trashed in survival and want to take it out on someone they can bully. I’d suggest avoiding workshops if you’re going to do any crafting. I look at most players outside of my fireteam as hostile until proven otherwise.
---
Might as well complain that people keep killing you in CoD while you’re at it.
---
That was harsh but needed to be said.
---
Maybe they were duped.
---
Unfortunately, there are some ass hats roaming the wasteland just to fuck with people who claimed a workshop. They specifically go for low level players who can't defend themselves. Which only proves that they are cowards who are too scared to face a real opponent. I'm sorry you had to encounter such players. From experience I can tell you that most people I met so far are pretty chill.
---
Should you ever happen upon one of my camps with resource extractors, feel free to take what you need. I don't lock them because they produce more than I need anyway.

Backpacks will get delayed anyway. They couldn’t even deliver on a camera.. a small handheld fuckin camera. If that had to be delayed along with player vending &amp; every other feature promised to us in April then May will be a depressing month
---
get rid of the broken combo instead.
---
Why u hate PA users so much ;-;
---
We already don't get legendary armor and a bunch of good perks. You could argue mods allow PA to be on par... with a 1* armor piece. And most of the mod options are quite weak compared to premium legendary prefixes.
---
nuked it 4 times in the weekend, it is garbage.
---
It's only been 25 years since the bombs and just 5 or so since the people disappeared. Any worn down wasteland look is probably pre-war.
---
🤣 *Hits once, blows own hand off at the wrist*
---
Took me a while to realise the structure in the back was your camp it was so well made and fits in well like a relatively prestine prewar structure.
---
While I was still relatively a noob I had a camp outside whitesprings and it got nuked I didnt understand why I kept dying when I respawned there! I server hopped and realised I was in the fallout.
---
&gt;she has also had the serum plans removed off her lootpool in this patch. so theres that aswell.
---
Aha! I was really wondering why serums are suddently so expensive that even offering to buy several for 8k, no one was selling. Thanks for tellin.
---
I thought maybe all people just started to farm mutations to sell them to vendors because of the cap limit change, so that would have caused the price to increase. I've so far only got one serum so it kinda sucks abit.
---
Agree with this,ive been wandering about with the Enclave Officers outfit on for months cause i cant find anything better 2 wear.
---
Sorry to necro, but this is flat-out untrue. Intelligence definitely buffs xp gain, and stacking chems + intel bonuses from armour can give insane xp rates.
---
A man after my own heart. I've never been so happy for ammo smith and super duper than after dumping 4k 50 cal rounds into a SBQ.
---
Mate i've had a broken camp for the longest time i just don't care to repair it, as camps are just... meh. They don't prevent you from playing the game, crafting in anyway shape or form, do people spend 90% of their day sitting at their camp? Is that why it bugs them? I'm only at my camp to store in my stash, don't even trade their anymore and it was built as a shop/hub. Easier to just meet the people.
---
I've had people come at my camp, an i fight back, it's fun. It's better than a scripted 100% winnable NPC shootout
---
* Get robbed. Trade an item to a player while third-party player points a gun at you.

* Third-party player actually shoots you after trade is completed. (Optional)
---
Aw man. A legit repeater crossbow would be cool. Just make it out of rebar and junk. Then it won't look like something borrowed from Skyrim haha.
---
Yes! If only there were plans for them... or if they actually drop as legendaries so we don't have to wear clothes to hide our awful legendaries mixed drop.
---
Wearing my bomber jacket and hood with pride.
---
I'll try not to, thanks.
---
I've thought about it because of certain abilities but in the end, it seems too complicated on how to get mutations and keep them.
---
The fact that this game encourages constant server hopping full stop is odd. It concerns me that further balancing around it is been made rather than balancing the game around staying on the server you join.
---
Did you sell stuff to a vendor before logging off? There’s a vendor issue that moves your highlighted item to the top and you have to quit out of the vendor menu and go back in. A lot of people have been losing items this way and not realising. I just grabbed a BE Gatling gun from the watoga vendor and I doubt anyone sold that on purpose.
---
Well I never suggested "NOW". But you know, give us like one ranged, one melee each update. Then maaaaybeee one armor set (for free if not purely cosmetic) on special occasions.
---
Im not one of these "BGS Implement everything want or else no more play your game" people. 
---
I'm just saying, 4 was light on viable guns through late-game, so is this one. We all know why the legendary system exists: to cut down on the number of weapon models needed for the game, and therefore cut down on the total size needed, save money blah blah blah.
---
I should have just left after I died the first time, but after how long I had spent getting mats, I just kept trying. Apparently wasn't worth it, and will be server hopping if it happens again.
---
It's a strong combination like, would you suggest they change sentinal and cavalier to primary prefixes?
---
Makes sense as they're a 15% mitigation i suppose
---
I know what a doorbell is, I was asking what the reference meant in FO76, particularly the following line in the OP.  "The Iron Hero of the Wasteland statue is poofing out pretty purple blocks!" ??  
---
Is it referring to a mod or vanilla content item/object?
---
I'll happily sell you an AA gat! I just picked one up a few days ago.
---
Who could possibly afford that 18k anyway, particularly with old vendor system of hopping around 200 caps from each? While the serums themselves were selling for few hundreds of caps.
---
Few months ago I brought my first for 10k, which was probably little more than others were paying, but a perfectly fair price. Just before this latest change on PC, the standard price was around 5k-6k depending on seller, gradually as people get most they want, they stop buying and that had brought the price down.
---
My advice is to never capture workshops. They're not that good and if you want fusion cores just farm the whitesprings sentribots.
---
If you **really** want to capture a workshop do so then get the heck out of that area. If someone contests it fast travel and sneak instantly. They won't know where you went so they can't follow you.
---
Also, what they did isn't harassment and it's your own fault for 
---
1. Not stashing your stuff sooner
---
2. Going back to that area
---
3. Not serverhopping 
---
What they did isn't cool but you can easily solve the issue. If you keep feeding them your caps they won't stop.
---
redo the entire legendary system instead and turn into the crafting-based. get rid of the rng bs and turn it into more of a mmo. that's my suggestion, this rng bs just fueled the rampant duping.
---
I'm sure I'd have no end of giggles seeing my guy dressed as a mad scientist, walking around with an enormous Fat Man balanced precariously on his back.
---
Yeah, apparently so. I still need quite a lot of plans, but I guess I'll just keep hunting them down or buying them when I can. I was mostly concentrating on replacing stuff that my friend lost while trying to get me something from a high level area so that's more what I'm bummed about than anything. Put so much effort into trying to get them stuff to pay them back then these douchenozzles... bleh, but thanks for the advice!
---
No not roaming. I think he should have a stall that could appear anywhere on the map and remain in that spot for a week.
---
This is why the ammo business is thriving. Lots of us just make and sell ammo or junk that can be used for ammo. Saves a ton of time for people that dont like farming or researching all the best farming spots
---
deathclaws explode for area damage
---
I can get behind that. 600 hours on the game, my best drop is a 3* instigating SS combat knife lmao. Could be annoying with everyone running around top gear but on the same token, equal/level ground and would prevent a duped/group controlled economy that really only rewards a few

I was thinking of the bands Crimpshrine and Fifteen specifically in regards to a socialist agenda.  There’s others, but those two bands come to mind immediately.
---
Thank you! I've met a lot of chill players myself so this was really jarring since I'd been left alone for the most part. I had someone take my crops and try to break into my house until my couple of turrets scared them off, but that was the worst that had been done until tonight. 
---
Is your name the same in game? I really appreciate that! Thank you again. :)
---
Yeah but you only survive nuke zones *practically* with PA or Hazmats. I just think having an option for nuke runs that isn't those two would be a nice change of pace, and open up more style options to more players.
---
PA still has the damage reduction edge by far, and is much more durable. But it just feels clunky on my sneaky sniper (yes im aware of stealth mods, but you still make clanking noises while moving).
---
Actually, in FFXIV, 4-man ones are Dungeons, 8-man are Raids, the 24-man dungeons are Alliance Raids.

---
Nah mate, I didn’t miss that part. 
---
Just got a bit overshadowed by the rest of your post lecturing the OP on all the things he supposedly did wrong when just trying to enjoy the game in adventure mode, now that there are dedicated PVP servers. 
---
You know, some people just play games to enjoy themselves. Not everything needs to be an exercise in survival...
---
I don't need fusion cores, I have plenty stocked up already. I know very little about how contesting works because I'm not in the habit of taking things people have already put the effort into, and like I said in my post they didn't want the workshop they were just following me around murdering me wherever I was. Is that why I couldn't see them on the map at all? It literally is harassment because there were several other workshops owned by people lower than me but they weren't going around killing them, just me. So yeah, following someone around and bothering them is the definition of harassment. Especially since they obvious were just killing ME and didn't want it. If they had actually wanted the workshop they could have had it, if there's a way to relinquish it, I'd gladly have done so.
---
I literally said in my post that I'm aware I should have stashed my stuff sooner, but I was really into what I was doing so I'm not sure what your point is. I also didn't think of server hopping at first because I am not used to playing a game where that's even a thing. I'm used to games that have a fix server that you build communities with, not games like this. Of course I was going back to the area, I wanted my shit back, and didn't know they were going to stay there and kill me. It wasn't just the workshop, it was anywhere I went, they were following me and killing me.
---
I've played over 150hrs now on PC had this kind of thing happen 3 times were not all bad mate theirs assholes in every game

Enclave bunker. Pretty much guaranteed 3 to 4 at a time but I don't believe they stack so you have to turn them in one at a time. Then just server hop.

Works fine for me, when i have it equipt we can run in the air, did your team mate lose their mutations and not tell you or...?
---
But people are dicks and if you don't learn how to protect yourself nobody is going to protect you. I offered a solution to a very common issue and yet i'm the bad one for defending that behavior... oh well...

No problem military wing is the best place to find them.
---
This would do perfectly in my case.
---
Anything that allows me to quickly export the contents of a container to a text file would cut my 'Warehouse Manager 3.0' minigame time substantially and expunge the most tedious part of it.
---
Still no riot armor under the coat.
---
Fair enough, mate. Your advice is solid. 
---
However, next time think about leaving out the “it’s your own fault” part. 
---
That’s not helpful at all is, quite frankly, a dick thing to say in any situation.
---
Completely agree the weight on them is pointless.
---
Funny, all the while I was desperately tring to dump some of my about 600 springs off to anyone buying them. Screws are definitely more valuable than springs.
---
If the player vendoring comes early May like it should, I think you will find lots of easier ways to get those springs. Plenty of players can gradually farm far more than they need. Prices might go up a bit due to increased ease of trading, but nothing active players can't afford to, unless you make ammo with them.
---
I wish there were immersion servers without legendaries and where you never meta talk in the game. An actual roleplaying version.
---
Being both a Fo76 Player and a Warframe player, i definitely want this in 76, and have wanted it in WF for literal years
---
A good idea? No wonder you dont work for bethesda
---
I’d love some sights and barrel mods on the 10mm SMG too
---
Agreed, they should totally be vendorable.
---
If your still getting your lead from lead weights and not the lucky hole mine i have some bad news for you on brain size
---
I don't want to waste my time trying to find Bethesda quotes for stuff everybody already should know by heart, because said by them so many times in past.
---
This is so stupid about human NPC's, still nobody gives any point why they are needed. It's just some kind of addiction from previous games. Why do you need HUMAN NPC's? Put a Fallout 4 mod that replaces all human skins with synth skins - something changed? No.
---
Rose much? BIV? I yet to have seen anyone, who disliked these non-human NPC's and complained that it would have been better of a human.
---
Common, Bethesda can make a non-human NPC noticable and rememberable.
---
If you think that ppl don't enjoy environmental storytelling, which is amazing in this game, then you are wrong. If you think non-human and human NPC's differ either than by visual appearance (skins basically) also wrong.
---
I am not against non-human NPC's that you can interact with, that have personality, give you quests, options, dialogue, choices. Basically everything you want from a NPC, but since the border is already drawn - Human=Player, then let's keep it that way.
---
It is ridiculous, is like they are written in parchment.
---
Said that because 'weight' in game is an abstract; it could be by design as means to stop people from having hundreds upon hundreds of individual plans stored.
---
The devs have decided to blame large inventory sizes - not as much the amount of x item you may have but the amount of 'distinct' items - for all the game's woes; making it so it is unappealing to store plans/recipes due to their 'weight' would be consistent with this.
---
Do what he said. Also, dont take anything other than the data out of the desks. When you server hop, the items remaining reroll. What was an ashtray on one server can be technical data on another. Turning in one is the same as turning in five. The only thi g that changes is the cap payout. I farmed all the paints in 3 days doing this.
---
Sounds to me like this guy actually tried to RP a raider for once
---
I don't have any turrets, again your logic is as much fail as anyone else.
---
I agree but don't shit on Vault-tec! It's the company safeguarding your future! Without \_Vault-tec most would be lost. Vault-tec saved you all!
---
Prepared for the Future!
---
I don't have a fertilizer.
---
Update - 
---
Managed to fix this. the game when launched just wouldnt create the mygames directory.
---
Going into safemode and trying to run the EXE seemed to solve it. even though the game didnt run it created the folders required in My Games
---
You give too much of a shit.
---
Don't have turrets, still they should put a limit on how many turrets you can put down but looks like they aren't going to do that update either.
---
Same.
---
PA has the damage reduction edge? Lemme introduce you our lords and saviors, Sentinel and Cavalier.
---
I get your point though. Assassin's Sentinel Power Armor would just be obnoxious. And you can sort of get a bootleg version of it with protocols and certain other perks/items.
---
Just feels bad man. All I want is FDC redux power armor
---
They have slowly been tweaking it each patch to try to get things working. The most recent one actually has definitions for a normal version and a super version. The super version is what is used when strange in numbers is equipped and you are in a team that has another mutant
---
this is the bobby pins all over again, they were over weight as well, it's to limit how many you can carry
---
A settlement won't work if the budget is only up a "tad".
---
I would have loved to see little settlements being built down and stuff, but with the current budget we got we are only going to live in a small shed house with NOTHING in it but only for the essentials that we need.
---
and with the huge SPACE we have, we can hardly really do anything with it.
---
Then you’re expecting too much or building badly...
---
It literally tells you when you claim the place it opens you up to pvp.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Careful.. You might piss Nukacrypt off, as they don't believe people if you solve it before they do.
---
As I'm seeing, more so good than bad. I know how to handle it now, from what others have suggested, if it happens again. I've also found more people willing to help than harm. I just don't see the point of playing like this. Why get to 305 and harass a lower level player? I don't get being that douchy. They could have taken the workshop if they wanted it, I would have just walked away, but that's obviously not what they wanted. urgh, anyways, thanks for the support. :)
---
I want to be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
---
I suspect he was in adventure mode, too much of a wuss and meet real folks who pvp.
---
I have to giggle everytime someone says stuff like this in todays time, where millions of dollars are made each das with all kinds of "virtual bullshit". People might not have invested money in there camp, but time and commitment and that has to be worth something, even to you.
---
Nice one! I do the same, the northern most site is closest to the fissure and makes this easy. My current record is 14 kills during the event. It's an co farm
---
cause the perk/card system is stupid, I've been saying this to the rest of this community and they haven't listened, its so frustrating having to level up just so you can switch your points and cards around, there's no use to it and no other MMORPG game has this.
---
It was most likely me. Beer keg is from a weekly for brewing that we haven't gotten yet and the poster is from the upcoming scouts questline
---
I did expect too much since the AREA space we have is quite huge and we'd love to build OUT on that, the only reason why they have put a limit on it is because Bethesda's potato-driven servers can't handle it.
---
Haha that made me feel good.  I'm no genious inventor but I got the basics for how a drill is used👍🏻
---
PC? if you're online in 3-4 hours (8est), hmu and I'll juice you suit. All I'll really need is some aluminum/fiberglass for materials.
---
Screenshot please.
---
Yet this is just another Beth pls thread.
---
Max rank concentrated fire is useful, as I use it to gain accuracy on scorchbeasts, along with additional damage. I found that spreadsheet, it says 15 luck? Maybe I lost something in translation. You have a good point with class freak though. And I use both gun fu and grim reapers sprint so I can chain together kills rapidly,  I'll look into lowering the rank and fitting in adrenaline.
---
1. Visual glitch. Their HP nevers goes down to 1. Its just the bar that receives "remove 500*X from this 300", but needs some time to calculate that X= 0.002.
---
2. Harpoon cavalier is my first char. Bloodied vatscrit sneaket is my 2nd. Now I'm making weightless sentinel burst sniper.
---
3. This is ultra-build-dependent.
---
4. Quad 1* automatic tesla &gt;&gt;&gt; any 3* nonquad tesla
---
War Drum is listed as Medium speed while it is actually Slow.
---
That's literally not the point of the post, my dude. It is about the fact that a level 305 player was harassing me, a level 39 player. If they wanted the workshop they could have taken but they didn't they just followed me wherever I went and murdered me. I went back a couple of times to try to get my stuff then went off to areas nearby to explore. I don't know how to relinquish a workshop and I'm certainly not going to waste ammo on people I have no hope of killing.
---
This is actually incorrect. The data files actually sat that you need the torso peice in order to get extra ore mined and it is still only double
---
Could I have 1 electrically charged serum my IGN is disjointedlime and how many mutations can you have at one time
---
Oh wow well done!! I'm still trying to collect all the pieces for each silo! You're awesome.
---
You had to get it then
---
Idk where you're finding the damage resistance stuff but the rad resistance reduces it to 15% of the rad damage. Hazmats have a similar perk that reduces it to 2% of the rad damage. Also it has nothing to do with how many armor pieces as the base chassis gives you the mitigation
---
Suppose it is, I just wanted to make a suggestion and hopefully to see my fav set in this game one day, had to mod it into Fallout 4 much to my displeasure. Sorry for the Beth pls but Beth pls
---
Imma pour one out for your junk.
---
I had this exact thing happen but it didn't happen until I started to move. Once I moved the perk dropped off
---
I don't really know what you mean by this, but thanks, I think.
---
Is that too much to ask for 😂😂
---
Thanks but we work WITH nukacrypt and they always encourage others to solve from what I've seen.
---
I have no idea. It’s just an option that I didn’t know I had, I saw it when adding quantum paint because before that I didn’t use x-01.
---
Thank you!!!
---
I did this, but it was \*before\* I played Fallout 4!  It was so odd to see Boston again in-game and recognise the major landmarks.
---
actually my friend was the one that notice, that it was just a normal marsupial jump.
---
Time to throw Chipotle into the sea.
---
It's may very well be a roleplaying game but that's mostly by name. There's been a few encounters with other players that I have had that have been fully in character. I'm very curious to your immersive explanation to why you would destroy some brick walls but not others. Why don't you go bashing on Big Al's Tattoo shop, or hack away at the fusion generator at the shack south of Mama Dolches, or other Bethesda made structures?
---
That's right, you treat the same thing (if you actually roleplay) differently based on your meta information of the items in-game. Ie, you use roleplaying as an excuse for griefing.
---
Also the movie Mothman Prophesies.  I tried to watch it again recently and it has not aged well =/
---
Isn’t the The Pitt like a small hike north of the toxic valley? Could write it in as Pittsburgh Riot armour  with decal changes.

Here ya go.

First screenshot shows the resistance values of the x-01 helmet to prove that the second screenshot real, as it doesn’t show the name in the second shot. The cap and weight value changed because of the mod. The third shot is my mods in my inventory, the fourth is my stash. I should not that when crafting it I get the same result as I do trying to add mods, the bug that doesn’t allow them. I get the same thing when trying to craft other pa mods at random. Not sure if it’s a glitch, me having the plan but it IS there.
---
I know how you feel, in the beta I got killed by some lvl 15 or so when I was lvl 8 because of a workshop and he took my junk, didn't stop until I got my junk back and then immediately left
---
AH HA HA HA HA HA HA..... Surely you're not serious? Nukacrypt encourages others to solve it.. Hahah Doubt. 
---
Congrats on solve it though.
---
Sell them to other players.

for me the lag after loading screens (especially when loading in to a new server) has been a bit worse than normally but usuallty it works fine again after i let it load for a few seconds after i’m past the loading screen. but the lag spikes are completely random, can last up to several seconds and they’ve gotten me killed more than once. i think the bad performance and stability came with the burrows because we got no maintenance so it messed up a lot of things
---
True.
---
Maybe they are for lobotomizing people. Cue Old World Blues!
---
It's fake news like this that give the Russians a bad name.
---
Like I said, after the SB flashing and screaming, the ASAM wooosh BANGs and so on I had to go lie down for a while.
---
If I was epileptic those fuckers could kill me IRL.
---
I think that would be cool. I believe the riot gear from the lonesome road dlc was around before the bombs dropped it was used by the L.A.P.D so technically it would still be lore friendly

Nice post.
---
Great job ! Are you guys working on Bravo btw ? I just cleared the silo and realized the code wasn't decrypted yet (Yeah I'm dumb like that)
---
^("Big iron on his hip")
---
That's the part that got me, sk7586 (er, sorry, if there's a way to tag users, I don't know how to do it), the "it's your own fault" bit. Especially when I said right there in my post that I'm aware I should have put my mats away sooner, but I didn't because I was so involved in what I was doing and focused on recouping mats for my friend. He went into a higher level area, got me an item I wanted, died then dc'd losing his mats in pursuit of something for me.... I didn't foresee - and I'm not exaggerating when I say any of this- that the second I came out of the workbench to turn to walk to my stash box which was like I don't know 5 feet from where I was standing, that I was going to get murdered by someone way higher in level than myself.
---
&lt;insert Jurassic Park clever girl gif here&gt;
---
And I provided that info for him.
---
It’s still time though. I know some people overreact, but most of the time people are just stating their dislike for the practice of griefing bases. It takes real life time to deal with that result of that, and some people have work and social lives. It only doesn’t matter if you have the whole day to play games. I drive for Uber so if I didn’t have a crazy amount of junk, I’d be spending time farming the repair materials instead of making money because I choose my own hours. Or actually enjoying the game.
---
I feel your pain. I lost my tse combat rifle this weekend after fast traveling from west tek to whitespring. Turned in a ticket. They send you a form email reply saying basically ‘sorry this happened but we cannot replace missing items’. I complained about the response and got... the same email again. This stinks.
---
It definitely isn't lye. It's lime as in calcium not lime as in citrus. It makes the niacin in the corn more bioavailable.
---
I mean,  I run a bar near the overseer camp.  People totally like ballistic Bock.  I also stock up on mags,  bobbles, stealth boys, other aid. 
---
I've made pretty decent
---
Er system?
---
Yeah this whole 'server hop' advice never really works for me.  I tend to end up back on the same server too, I think.
---
You had to collect it yesterday :/
---
That's weird. Should be both 'pistol' and 'revolver'.
---
Though a challenge being bugged would not surprise me in the slightest.
---
I'd rather have them delay it and try to get it right, than to rush it out and see it horribly broken then see the flood of complaints that they never test things/rushed it out :P
---
The BUN SQUATCH! Hahah yes I love it 😈
---
Ugh, that sucks. People are mean. Is there a way to let go of/relinquish a workshop if someone contests it without pvp/dying? or do I literally have to server hop?
---
We need more military type gear, stuff for survival, not fucking tuxedos. Also a bandolier and pouches
---
Sounds like you missed your window.
---
It baffles me why they changed that honestly
---
C’mon man... you said you wouldn’t show anyone those pictures.
---
I see, I've got something similar, wish it was the x-01 mod but, when I got to apply a skin to the left arm of my t-51, I'm able to apply bone raider. It's weird. Oh well, that's cool man, saves you some server hopping.
---
anyone know if this will have the power armour disappearing bug fixed?
---
Man, the Pitt dlc still had one of the best moral choices.
---
That’s what I thought too. I mean the name of the weapon should be a clear answer ie: .44 pistol (even though it’s stamped magnum on the barrel. 10mm pistol, pipe revolver, single action revolver. Unless some aren’t what they are meant for. 
---
Just strikes me as odd that the shorter one hasn’t moved since. But the longer and more specific one has.
---
😏😏 I've shown my Fat Man, plz respond.
---
Awww darn, yes we are working on Bravo but not solved yet!  Had over 1,000 possibilities!
---
I think after some time the workshop becomes theirs, have never tried that but I think that's how it works. If someone comes the best thing is to fast travel away and then crouch because they can not see where you are then
---
Dead money was my moral quandary. But yeah the Pitt was lunch in the satchel.
---
Ok I'll pm you
---
Until the last patch my challenge for creating and scrapping power armour was at zero for me and some of my location challenges are permanently unfinished, even if I've been to all locations required.
---
Chalking it up to bugs.
---
Perfectly 5k, I assume that's the bounty limit?
---
Thanks for the information. So, equipped with these codes, what else do I need to launch a nuke? Never done one before and was hoping to complete the quest
---
My psn is pdt0830. Send me a friend request and I’ll give you a few weapons to get u through.
---
Your archive2list is wayyyyyy too long. Either combine the loose files from those into a single ba2 or rename them also there's a chance that some if not all of those might not work. Have to remember that if Bethesda updates the files and the mod doesn't then it will break things.
---
That was my first thought but the 10mm tse I found was at white spring. To be honest this was the first thought I had.
---
Where’s the damn fire?!!!
---
Yeah a lot of my location ones I had to revisit as well as take a photo to complete both even though I did one or the other long before. The twitter I believe said that you’d have redo the ones you completed in beta. 
---
Also I have laugh because someone downvoted this: a straightforward question. Reddit will never not amaze me.
---
Damn it. My lose
---
Guess it’s a glitch. I did think x-01 mod plans were impossible but when I saw this I figured they were added in a patch. Guess it’s one of the few good glitches, thanks ;)
---
So you just need a nuclear key card and then you go in the silo clear it all the way to the end room and initiate launch prep.  Defend the cheifs and then launch the nuke!  Take lots of stimpaks and some radaway with you.  Fully repaired weapons, and back ups!
---
No problems, I'll just leave and clean another one, my fault for not looking beforehand ahah. Thanks for the quick update!
---
I’m just upset it has a broken ear. I would have liked to get a new undamaged/clean version from collecting all the eggs and have the broken version we got be a free version for every one.
---
To get a nuclear key card you can go in the control room of the Enclave bunker and request a cargo bot that will give you a nuclear key card.
---
I wish they sold weapon skins that were universal. I like a lot of the ones on the shop, but there’s not one for the 10mm smg
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that awhile back
---
So I’m really careful and sell slowly just out of habit now. I spend awhile with vendors as I’ve had to buy weapons back at some point
---
Been there 4 times so far, twice completely empty, one time had miners and the other a single ghoul.  Mob respawns are unreliable as I hang around for \~15-20mins and no enemies spawn.  
---
I think unless they're there when you first check, it's not worth trying to find them.
---
Nuka World style Raider Outfits would be sweet
---
I wondered that as well but a t60 mod I had just picked up vanished at the same time.
---
Hope she doesn't fly off with about 10% health &amp; 15 minutes to go like she just did in my world wtf?
---
"What a toxic post", said the griefer. If your idea of fun is purposefully destroying someone's base (which in no way benefits you), then you're a douchebag.
---
Yeah I get that
---
My connection is very stable but I had the weapons for awhile before they went it was like, 
---
Played
---
Logged off
---
Logged back in 
---
No guns
---
I’ll try put a support ticket in
---
Oh wow, well thank you for the information and advice, much appreciated.
---
I can understand the financial need to not have them universal.  But at least offer them.  And why no marine armor skins?
---
Haha yeah someone said this to me in another thread that it’s easy to accidentally drop. I did double check though I try to be extra careful in my inventory these days
---
Lemme fix my Corn with this Drill
---
Thanks dude but I’m PC :( 
---
I appreciate the gesture though
---
If you have another keycard you should be able to just swipe it and enter the correct code!  No need to leave the silo!
---
[looks good with a power armor frame](https://imgur.com/gallery/sdsrD26)

i look for TSE pipe/10mm pistol with 25% less vats cost

Don't forgot the fact that older fallout games had weird crap Like monty python references or the Tardis.
---
*inhales*

TO THE TOWN OF ADA FRIA CAME A STRANGER ONE FINE DAY
---
They can stop contesting as soon as they kill you, and if the workshop has not switched ownership, start the timer for the next contestation all over again. They can farm you for caps anywhere on the map this way if there are at least two of them - one at the workshop and one ganking you wherever you may be.
---
Yeah it really does, I’m on the verge of quitting. The grind in comparison to other titles along with issues like these are a recipe for disaster 
---
I’m sticking to it though but I’m not sure how long
---
nevermind was thinking of Alpha!!!! lol Bravo not solved "yet"
---
If it's a bloodied meat hook, that thing wrecks for a low tier weapon
---
I'd love to but people won't buy them off me or try to kill me when I get within sight of them
---
It was the modding of weapons. Apparently the models were clipping too much for Bethesda to feel happy with it
---
It like it in a vaguely Payday 2 kind of way. Feel like I'm about to rob a bank. Otherwise I can take it or leave it.
---
2am here time for my bed!  But yeah definitely give either Alpha or Charlie a try!
---
I'm with you there. I've never had anyone bother me let alone murder me until tonight, and I'm incredibly frustrated over it. They just walked into my workshop as a level 305 (and I'm 39) and shot me as I was coming out of my armor bench and literally -no exaggeration- about to go stash my junk in the box. I guess took my junk? and kept murdering me wherever I'd spawn be it at the workshop or elsewhere. I didn't see them doing this to anyone else and it seems like griefing/harassment to follow someone around that's only a fraction of their level. I don't get why, in pacifist mode, we don't get an option to just immediately surrender. That's how I got to this thread because I was looking to see if there was one. I eventually blocked them and hopped servers, which I didn't think to do initially because this isn't the type of game I normally play; I'm used to games where you build a community, not random people and random people murdering me for resources that I'd gladly give up. but for real a level 305 should not need what a level 39 has. jfc. It about made me hate the game.
---
Scrub attack foils in locked position.
---
I remember reading something a long time back about how it was attempted but it was a nightmare with clipping through the many outfit and armor combos available. Obviously mods added it later but that was why the studio had to scrap it. This was in reference to FO4 .
---
If you take workshops, just don't hang out there in a non-crouched position. Do only very necessary crafting there.
---
Yikes, ok Dr. Freud.
---
All the time, any enemy, like an aura of death. 
---
Ghouls grown and start to stand then topple over dead, robots come out of their pods limp, just had a mirelurk die mid-unburrow and physics careen about 30ft into a lake.
---
Mobs already seem scarce as is, having the few that do show up instantly die is frustrating.
---
faster reload speed
---
Scrub 8 1/2 reporting out, all systems are gone.
---
Yeah. I prefer to engage with real people and not a search engine thanks.
---
My nerf gun got nerfed -- now it kills people.
---
Shrek costume anyone?
---
Keep the rare ones to trade and drop the rest for new players. If you’re actually having trouble with plan weight, like 20-30 lbs, it’s because you have tonnes of plans you don’t need or won’t get anything for. Getting rid of them can only help you, and new players love it.
---
K I messaged you doesn't show your on.
---
they are called "underarmor" in-game. outfits is something different. there is also raider leathers, marine fatigues, and probably more.
---
you can find up to 3 upgrades for each underarmor which you can apply at the armor bench (like lead lining, resistant lining, etc); it'll be under the category of "underarmor". same category if you'd want to craft any of these (given you have the recipe).
---
That sounds exactly like what they were doing! That seems very cheaty, like harassment, and griefing, to me. I don't get why someone in pacifist mode doesn't get an option to surrender the workshop and not get murdered like this. I'm very frustrated to the point that I don't want to play, and probably won't for a while unless it's with a friend.
---
I like the concept, just not a fan of non-symmetrical broken stuff.
---
I'd like to see that feature :)
---
I would but I only even seem to find people above level 30 I haven't seen any one lower than lvl 10 for ages
---
i just want my firecracker whiskey
---
I will get in touch! We’re a pretty diverse, relaxed group. Always happy to have more guns/weapons on our side for a SBQ.
---
The game has more of a Sims vibe that a survival one.
---
Has happened to me several times.
---
It's all RNG. Been doing this for months now and have 4 of the paints.
---
Sure some days can't be bothered and some days will do 10 plans, but still it might take a bit longer than three days for some.
---
Just like some get BOS combat armor plans easily while I've been doing 20-40 server hops a day for a week and haven't seen one.
---
Player vending cannot come soon enough. I'm in a low level area for that purpose; to sell to low level players the stuff I don't need and other stuff that's higher level or legendary. Low levels generally run or people as a whole are cautious about trading because of past bad experiences. So player vending would help me so much in this.
---
Missed a perfect chance to be at ground zero.
---
I only play now when new stuff is added to the game; my hybrid build is long done, got all the weapons I needed for a while and all the map locations are visited ... too bad the new quest lines are short, wish they would allow player made content at some point to make things interesting
---
Agreed cannot wait for the player vending
---
Im at 4 and definetely have thought about increasing it up to 5, but then I need to reallocate some other stuff. I do have kinda at least 3 in agility that I don't really use right now having retired my last pistol, but not sure what I will ultimately use the other specials, so I don't want to respec immediately.
---
Wow that’s crazy. I always have a level 4 or so in Flatwoods. Every few servers there’s a level 1 in the vault too. Another thing you could do is dump some in the overseers cache.
---
Isn't the ammo a bit of a nightmare for it compared to .50 and 5mm?
---
It sounds like what jenterland said, I don't think they were actually trying to take it, I think they were just trying to get my caps. One of them was hanging out at the workshop and the other was finding me and killing me in the workshop or outside of it. I've blocked the 2 players in question because I never want to be in a server with them again.
---
If you can make it up to Philipi Cemetery the Civil War suit spawns the in the cases inside the building.
---
Thanks for the answer but when the hp bar is a visual glitch why I really can’t kill them but how they kill me when I use my full assasins sentinel?
---
Btw I also got this rarely on PA users but usually I 1-2 hit pa users and they cant have assasins sentinel
---
Holotape drive for this one.
---
That's really nice to hear! Stories like these are always so nice to hear! :)
---
He could be just amused and making a sarcastic joke.
---
Why go to the nuke? Bring the nuke to you!
---
Or just don't have a system where you get duplicates. Do as OP suggested and just be able to pick and get cards you don't have Max rank yet.
---
I don't know if this is what causes it but from my observation this happens when there is nobody shooting at her for some time. You know.. Hiding out waiting for more players to come etc etc. Making her exit combat and leave. Again.. Don't know if this is true. But both times i have seen it happen, it seems to have been because of this. Kinda. I guess.
---
I'll keep that in mind; I didn't know crouching was necessary or even helpful in this case. I didn't take workshops on the ps4 version, and only have been doing so to do the events so I can get plans and stuff. I'd seriously gladly give up the workshops if someone actually wanted them, but that doesn't seem to be the case with what happened tonight.
---
ye dude that's the plan
---
also some quick swap loadouts for perks would be real nice
---
Probably a filler ingredient, people in Africa eat clay to feel fuller so it’s the same principle.
---
angry boomer posts like this are the reason I read this sub
---
Wasn't the case this time, took off &amp; headed north straight away , plenty of players there giving it a go
---
Yup,  flew past the off limits area and gave us two flying fingers from a distance.
---
At level 200 you have nearly all cards.
---
Been there.
---
I use bandolier and carry all the ammo on me, I think I have 35000 5mm on my character right now. Not to mention the thousands of rounds I have of all the other types of ammo.
---
Unpopular opinion incoming but paying real money just to look cool is almost a waste. Id call it a half waste of money. If im going to spend money, id rather do it for something that'll have an actual impact on my gaming experience.
---
Maybe you're confusing Surface to Air with A Line in the Sand?
---
Cool.
---
Then your game is bugged cause it worked for me and others, as well as the fact moderators have directly stated that the ones that spawn there work.
---
I agree. But I would have rather the rare items stay rare and expensive from the get go. Instead of everyone having all high end weapons and gear now and only selling stuff for insane prices
---
Well, that's kinda a good idea for once.
---
I've seen all sorts of suggestions related to perk cards and most of them are "pls make everything ez", which I'm not a fan of.
---
Just search for it in market, I bought this same syrum for 200 caps last night. Found others posted for 150 caps each.
---
Part of the game.
---
There was a time when mods where scrapped when stored in your workshop? Could that be your issue?
---
I think that the Brotherhood would still direct its efforts towards destroying the scorchbeasts weather or not they know of the Enclave or not. First things first.
---
There could be Enclave events murdering other Enclave members for power. That's more in-line with the story. Enclave has killed it's own before and I think there should be events where Enclave members need to sever MODUS connections with the outer world (as have happened before) and then new member could rebuild them again. Keeps the cycle.
---
I agree. I had a guy destroy everything in my camp, who died abouth 15x in the process. He didn't have any caps, so dying didn't discourage him. I'll never understand the mindset that makes trolling fun. "Haha, I made you think that I'm an asshole. I got you good!"
---
&gt; Nixtamalization /nɪʃtəməlaɪˈzeɪʃən/ is a process for the preparation of maize (corn), or other grain, in which the corn is soaked and cooked in an alkaline solution, usually limewater (but sometimes wood ash lye)
---
I keep getting wood armor.
---
Interesting! But how would the mission be assigned? MODUS certainly wouldn’t want his connections severed, and he’s the Enclave quest and event giver.

---
And it is how I completed it.
---
only a few more weeks to wait, and this won't be an issue any more, once player vending comes in they are making camps indestructible by other players whilst in pacifist mode
---
Yes
---
😱
---
I never stored anything. I just fast travelled, killed some stuff, and when I checked to see if anything good dropped my inventory stopped at ‘s’.
---
Go on the pvp server.
---
I don't know but my first reaction was that someone knows your login info / password..
---
Right! It made me remanence the good ol’ payday 2 days!, exactly why I wear the tux with it!
---
Hell ye!
---
You notice how pvp aspects moved to the pvp server? How bout you go there to?
---
You know it's a problem when you have to spend that much time outside of the game to benefit in game. It's also why  I am sitting on ungodly amounts of bulk, I don't want to fool with having to go between phone/pc and game constantly. Even when I find something and post to hold it for others, I'm usually only there for 15 minutes so I can get back to actually playing.
---
Oh ok, my observations have been just coincidence
---
Please don't create suggestion posts if they contain topics which have been retired to Bethesda Plz: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz
---
Normally I’d agree with you but I kind of like it since it’s fallout and all, wear and tear adds character! And it looks all the more menacing 😈
---
People are salty cause theyre tired of Bethes'duh and the almighty Todds bs. Were tired of decade old bugs and glitches that could be permanently cured but theyd rather keep the same old engine cause they say its efficient. No its not. Its consistent, at sucking. Plus their whole excuse that were the 1st vault opening being the reason there arent human npcs is crap. There is no interaction whatsoever aside from other players. Its like a less hardcore version of rust, but with questlines. Its not horrible but they could do a bit better. Its a good game but a horrible Fallout.
---
That’s something I would love to see.
---
&gt; Am i the only person that thinks that the weight of the plans and recipes is too much and should be reduced. The plans having a weight of 0.25 is a bit rediculous and it should be lowered to something like 0.01 or even 0.1 because it's really had that if you have a better much of plans you want to try and trade with people and your carrying them all the time they take up so much carry weight. 
---
TIL: 0.01 &gt; 0.1
---
I do, your point being? I was on Adventure mode an saw a level 55 killing a level 5, i made him quit.
---
Does me saying to defend yourself make me a camp raider? No. Jumping to accuations because you're a boring pacifist, and that's not my problem.
---
These level 5's were dying defending themselves, and didn't come here to moan.
---
I've got 100x more respect for them, than everyone else here downvoting people because they're so sad an anti-social they want a lone experience where they're the gods of their own wasteland, dictating who does/doesn't do what, i' sorry. But you're no overseer.
---
People NEED to realise this, the amount of hidden downvoted comments here real pain a sad picture for the stare of this sub.
---
I believe it is an exploit of the current game mechanics, too. I doubt Bethesda intended these assholes to do what they're doing, but they can, and so far it hasn't been addressed. Be assured you are not the first to complain. As for me, I still take workshops, but if I get killed, I close the app and restart. I'll not be farmed.
---
TSE lasers melt enemy’s.
---
I'll sell you one for 25001 caps. Kappa
---
You can make sure the event can be activated (by having someone without a recall card check the terminal) and then you nuke the area before you start the event yourself (or have a buddy do it).
---
The BoS Officer plan has a spawn location in a train car just west of Watoga Station; it spawns BoS Officer, soldier, and knight plans. The location also spawns the plans for all marine armor pieces, the marine wetsuit, and several other armor sets.
---
Ha. It's one of those rare instances where we're both right. It's an internet miracle. 
---
Thank you HughesJohn for the clarification...we won't...forget about you...
---
I would give my TSE Handmade for that mask
---
Honestly, some of those guys are gonna search for you on the map wherever you are or wait until it's time for you to defend, and then jump you. Crouching while you are at the workshop (or anywhere) just makes your yellow dot disappear from the world map, effectively hiding you from the douchecanoes who are looking.
---
I saw the Fairbairn-Sykes skin in tha atom shop and bought it without having a knife to use it on. Have since then aquired two Anti-Armor. They're not that good, but I love them and use them as much as I can.
---
Harness gets you a free pass to BDSM events too. Friend told me.
---
Loser probably doesn’t have 5k. You’d be lucky to get any cap at all for killing it.
---
same here, it's an awesome outfit.
---
I was so happy to finally get the complete set
---
Yeah people like that suck.
---
You die from vats critshots. They go through sentinel like it wasn't there. Complete negation of its prottective effects.

*Puts on mask*

Biggest problem is that we don't know how far under the world the actual location cells are, but I have for sure seen the Uranium Fever event pop up there instead of in its correct location, so Blackwater Mine should definitely have its inside cell there. But again, it might be so far under the map that a Nuke sphere will not reach it.
---
I'd imagine you'd start it from reading a terminal and realizing that the ones who did it before were right. Now it's up to you to stop a renewal of the war with China.
---
Awesome! Have an up-vote for showung that a post-apocalyptic world can be enjoyable.
---
Look at how pathetic this sub is. All the downvoted comments are people saying; you're in NO position to tell others how to play.
---
There isn't even a guarantee that anyone here is a raider/griefer, i'm not. I do SBQ's on Adventure, trade on adventure, PvP on Survival, does that matter? No.
---
Because i don't play the way YOU want me too, and i'm the problem?
---
The moderators REALLY need to take a look at this sub, and make some decisions, it's complete bullshit people can be bashed just for playing the game their own way.
---
"I can do/say what i want but YOU can't"
---
What are we, 10? Grow up.
---
True! supermutants and robots are fairly common at high level areas, watoga, westek, and every nuclear silo. I read somewhere that the scorchbeasts ranged attacks do explosive damage, not sure if its energy as well, but i have both grounded and the fireproof perk at 3, and almost take no damage from those attacks.

Hahahahaha this was also my thoughts 😂
---
Sort by hot and scroll down a little
---
But the players don't get to create the quest so that is a mute point. Another issue with this idea is the delivery of the quest. If it's a holotape or radio signal, it would have to explain how they found out about the Enclave in a lore friendly way. Everything suggest that the BoS were busy with the Scorched and expanding their influence in the area.
---
Rip
---
Thanks buddy, I usually sort by new.
---
Yes I am my bad.
---
I'm looking forward to sitting in my rocking chair up on the third floor of my CAMP and drinking a Nuka Cola while some loser attempts to attack me and/or my CAMP. Pity you can't throw items, I would throw a Nuka Cola over the railing and say  over area chat "Here have a Nuke and chill out."
---
Camden is considered part of the Ash Heap. Be mindful of that. Entering the Ash Heap wil trigger the daily, and if you crash, logout or fail the quest you may have to wait 20 hours for a reset. 
---
I despise the Lucky Mucker, myself. One time I was running it and the wooded picnic area (river included) had only half loaded in. It was my first stop, so I hit the other 3 locations and... It still didn't load in. I didn't get my 3 tokens that day.
---
When you see a notification about an “encryptid” event going on, i suggest you join it, and experience first hand what chaos is.  Just dont bring any junk with you. Its fun.  
---
Also, try some vintage nukashine. 
---
Both are from new events you can start at any train station, by interacting with the posters
---
To be absolutely clear this is a skin for something that already drops in the game or is an atomic shop item we can buy and supposedly change the skin between Appalachian and the Vintage cage armour we know?
---
Im not, won't be on for another hour
---
This complaint aside, It'd be nice if we could actually join factions and have faction based competition.
---
THE LOBOTOMITE IS CORRECT
---
&gt; We all know why the legendary system exists: to cut down on the number of weapon models needed for the game, and therefore cut down on the total size needed, save money blah blah blah.
---
It's also basic MMO grind thingy. Multiplayer like this, can't be played through. So the 3 star system allows so many combos, which so few are great, which also require that the base item is good, that it becomes the thing. You can farm a lot of things in this game in large quantities, but farming god-tier legendaries is just not happening.
---
I'm not at my PC right now but I think the number is 160 something. I mass produce Nukashine, Ballistic Bock, and High Voltage Hefe. Then I travel the world get people shitfaced for the fun of it. "Hey what kind of weapon you use?" "Oh, then you might want some of these". People seem to enjoy free booze.
---
I'm someone who strongly believes in the "treat others how you want to be treated, not how others treat you" line of thought.  
---
Which by extension means some people in FO76 want to be treated like an a-hole, because that's how they act, and if anyone role-plays as a Raider, that means anyone can just kill them for any reason, because Raiders are professional a-holes, they laways get what they deserve.
---
Yeah, get the impression I was the only one who didn't like the Fo4 torn mascot bear mask, since it show half the player's face.
---
I'd love to have the Classic Road Warrior style leather armor in the Atomic Shop.
---
They'll be removing camp damage soon, then these  no life scumbags won't be able to go around griefing them.
---
Oh ok, strange, mine works well on PC
---
I just want a t-shirt and overalls (no shoes) to look the part.
---
I have a train station trading camp at the moment, I had a few customers but not too many, so I decided to nuke my own camp and then i had loads of customers, nuking your own camp can be useful lol
---
Sooooo....is presidential power armor a thing? Never seen that before...
---
Oh, and good luck with the nuking
---
The challenge says 'Kill a Cave Cricket in Uncanny Caverns'
---
https://imgur.com/a/HrwIB8m
---
Is it different on your game?
---
It’s not acceptable and fortunately, not normal. You’re really unlucky. I’m level 230 so that might be part of why, but I haven’t had a workshop griefed or even contested before. I haven’t even had my camp trashed and I have 350 hours. I don’t think you’ll encounter this again, unless you’re very unlucky.
---
A lot of players are nice. Most of my experiences in the encrypted and SBQ events are good, with people reviving each other and whatnot. Yesterday myself and 4 others were chilling at some guys camp communicating with emojis, trading plans and I was playing hide and seek with one of them, then I made boxing gloves for everyone and we just beat up on each other. Finished the sesh with a screenshot of all of us playing different instruments. None of us even knew each other.
---
I also often buy low level useful legendaries like double handmades that people sell to vendors so I can mod them and drop them with ammo for new players. Feels good.
---
Thats an insane glitch.  I had the overweight respawn bug happen to me once or twice, but was in power armor, so didnt notice any change in stats. 
---
Pretty sure a lot of people are exploiting this right now, and none are talking about it.
---
The respawn bit always happens to me, but most of the time it doesn’t let me respawn anywhere. I have to try to team up with someone and respawn on then.
---
RUN FOR THE HILLS!
---
Its a game.... he can play as he wants without all your speculative ad hominem bullshit
---
yeah i saw him at whitespring golf glub, went there with a vat crit saved up to finish him but he was hiding somewhere under the map.
---
I end up hearing a whole conversation between him and another player who was salty as hell 
---
fun fact: the bounty guy was a cool guy
---
I've had the same thing happen to me and I wasn't at the workshop. They found me and one contested the workshop as the other one-shotted me. I just blocked the players and logged off for the evening. Yes I lost a lot of stuff including a few stable flux. Yes I was overconfident and stupid.
---
Since then I only take workshops if it's a challenge and then I jump servers to get rid of it. No more building up workshops as welcoming places for others with workbenches and free water and materials.
---

Close enough buddy
---
Your camp is off the scale, it's registering over 40 Mega Fonzies.👍🏻 I hope I stumble across it and bask in its Coolness, nice work.
---
Yeah and, it's just a suggestion if 0.01 was too small for some reason
---
So much cut content 😭 I could tell the Sunday brothers cabin was meant to have something more to it
---
Make your own easter egg hunt by hiding the eggs around you camp and inviting people to search for them, then ask them to do the same.
---
Once CAMPS are indestructible, more people will relax. So many grifters in the game, dupers, griefers, etc..
---
I’ve noticed when I play my main, I don’t get hassled for the Poseidon workshop often. But every time I load my level 20ish alt, I’m lucky to pull 2-3 cores out before someone comes by to contest.

I wear the drifter outfit with the grey knit cap, cappy glasses and the veil. Looks pretty apocalyptic.
---
That's not how the OP meant it or even wrote it. OP said 0.01 or 0.1 which is a higher weight and OP would be ok even with the higher weight. Smh
---
Group that couldn’t cut it in Survival, so they grief in adventure mode instead.
---
My experience was from having the food plant near Flatwoods and it was set up to be free help for new players. I was across on the other side of the world when I got one-shotted.
---
No more rebuilding appalachia in the workshops for me.
---
Yeah West Virginia doesn't look like what I've expected it to. When they've announced FO76 I've envisioned a world full of hardship and dirty, rugged wastelanders. Instead we've got guys in costumes jumping over buildings.
---
Ive seen a rare blue firefighter outfit and the trailer had a yellow one.
---
I thought it was just a set multiplier of your damage. So on low damage, high fire rate weapons crits are shit and beefy single shot weapons have beefy crits.
---
I collect all those eggs and got nothing on day 7...
---
Agreed, Fallout rpg and roleplaying doesnt work with people min/maxing and skipping all lore to grief people. It makes everyone else at a disadvantage.
---
That gave me a small theory. I don't have any Assassin's, Sent, or Cav armor to test this, but if this glitch doubles the effects of any armor and not just the Unyielding set that the player has equipped then it could be a major issue and maybe even possibly be the cause of some of the "why can't I kill these players" posts recently.
---
The link doesn't work mate
---
It looks so good combined with the sheepsquatch mascot outfit! I think I got my new suit 😎
---
In the top floor of the taxidermy ship is a board with 4 quests pinned to it.
---
OP fixes Water purifier with drill then wonders why it's leaking.
---
I got mine from the side-quests regarding the sheepsquatche if i am not mistaken. The one that leads you near site alpha.
---
We also need the Chinese assault rifle, and the old assault rifle! please!
---
Baseball Bat!  Anti-Armour, +1 STR and anything else that's useful ...... Level 84 and still haven't had a legendary baseball bat drop for me!  :-(
---
Ooops forgot to hit publish should work now
---
Seems to be just Grognak’s Axe. I didn’t have any other melee weapons that needed repairing in order to test it.
---
It spawned yesterday near fissure prime when i got there for the queen. It was fun to see people foght the queen ,then take a break for a lemonade.
---
I managed to get three of five scorps before giving up. I must have server hopped at least a dozen times. The one spot on the map that I know spawns scorps was either already picked clean or had bears/bees. You’re forced to compete with everyone else on the server when a specific uncommon enemy needs to be found at a specific location. Seems poorly thought out to me.
---
That's pretty damn swanky. Certainly nicer than my drug shack half way up a mountain.. Though the view from my balcony is nice at least.
---
Maybe I'll borrow that pool idea some day. 🤔
---
Nice tesla rifle you got equiped there.
---
Looks like a lighting glitch. Do you have a chargeable weapon ie: an assaultron head? That might be it
---
Nah its not a thing.
---
Not sure, I haven’t watched the video it just came up when I posted this post.
---
Also I went to the bathroom and did a long poo so I got kicked for inactivity :(
---
Just launched my first nuke, thank you very much for your work on the codes, really appreciate it
---
That could make it hard to line up a time since I am in the ET
---
Pretty realistic! There is an xp reward for being at ground zero jurring a nuke launch, I hope you were able to score that as well. Sorry to see your camp get blown up. Thanks for the share.
---
is it available in the atom shop? only have 5/6 eggs due to a bug not showing me an egg. wrote a ticket, answer: yes we now this bug existed but we arent able to give you the last egg. a bit sad to be honest \^\^
---
i cant see the bunny head in the atom shop so maybe its still the same bug, but who knows. would buy it for atoms now..
---
Was using a Tesla rifle in a nuke zone before it happened but it seems to be consistent between quitting and restarting as well
---
I don’t PvP and take workshops all the time.  Stay away from Red Rocket Megastop and the Converted Munitions Factory.  If you do take workshops, always stash your junk often.  First thing I do (if there’s not one already) is create a stash box and store your junk.  If time, I drop a table and scrap first.  If I am farming stuff like lead, etc I don’t take workshops that session.  
---
Note:  when I am in workshop mode I also check the map frequently, always am crouching, and fast travel often. Never take one near another.
---
You think that's showing even though it's holstered?
---
Yeah it does. Still a bug.
---
Suicide is badass
---
Any mod to the gun made it different and was kept. Different stock? Not a dupe.
---
No, after the last egg it just unlocks in your armor bench, I do hope they gift it to you since  you had a bug though friend!
---
It's part of a possible future enclave quest called Race for the Presidency or something to that effect. There's also a presidential gauss rifle.....from what I've seen it involves the voting machines.
---
(Looked and I can't seem to locate the datamine link)
---
Same thing happened to me before the last patch. But when I got there it was a scorched hord
---
Yeah but they have cool armour. That’s the only reason to side with them in any game. Fo76: Ultracite (and the bumblebee paint especially). Fo4: Danse is a great companion and has a good story, also if you install Danse Dilemma you get Maxson’s armour. FoNV: Cool armour and Veronica: who has good combat effectiveness and a good story. 
---
Tl:dr, BOS is a militaristic Atom Cats
---
That one I did not like actually
---
Awh didn't see these were here thanks
---
I honestly wouldn't care about the clipping. 
---
If it doesnt't work for some outfits, just make it a toggle so the users can decide for themselves if they want the weapon on the back or not.
---
Oh ok then phew thanks must admit I didn't try swapping weapons I did remove all my clothes like it was a prisoner collar kind of effect
---
No problem.
---
Literally me 😂 since I put on the mask I have made 10,000 caps 😬
---
Another mini-quest is pinned to the Grafton Station board
---
HARDLY SPOKE TO FOLKS AROUND HIM DIDNT HAVE TOO MUCH TO SAYYYY
---
Hot damn. Need that level of caps in my life.
---
Having a dungeon for each faction would be really awesome, they could alter The Burrows/add one in Cranberry Bog for The Brotherhood, make one at West-Tek or Robco for The Enclave, The Arktos Pharma one could suit The Raiders, or just literally anything for Raiders. For Free States, it could just be a bunker (or again altering The Burrows as that's in Harper's Ferry). (have I missed any factions?)
---
Mostly, I'd just love some faction updates and for the game to introduce an actual faction system.
---
Its an easy daily atom challenge of you get it
---
ty for the response and your words! they already answered me that they wont give me the last egg. so i dont think they will just give me the head. i dont know how many players had this bug but ive seen some posts about it. so nevermind, new day, new patch, future skins. im more into raider specific clothes so its only sad for a few days lol. congrats to everyone who got it!
---
The exp isn't really useful and the loot for the last two times a friend and I did it was just something like 20 caps (it isn't a full fledged quest, so list of items etc at completion...its literally less rewarding but more effort than turning in technical data).
---
I have had my camp destroyed numerous times, twice through nukes, (my fault the first time, I was on an inner part of the green in whitesprings. Second time I was at the foot of the hill near sheepsquatch). The other half dozen times was from other players.
---
Now I have an open base for trading and workshop usage and a small two-story building full of beds and instruments for people to sleep and be well tuned.
---
 I don't actually care about repairing my stuff when it gets destroyed but, I have moved around the map twice the amount of times I have been attacked and not once, not one singular solitary time has the blueprint for my shit placed back without issue.
---
If moving your camp worked every time all the time, this wouldn't be an issue.
---
And like I said, barring the flux needed for the decon shower, I don't actually care if I have to repair everything from the ground up.  
---
simply because it would take me longer to move it, try for half an hour to place the blueprint, scrap the damned blueprints to their components(which by the way has lost me more than half of some of my turrets, walls, and foundation pieces before) place them all in the exact same configuration they were in before, and replant all my crops.
---
TL:DR. No, just moving the camp doesn't always magically fix the problem.
---
The Dad is strong with this one.  Well played Sir, well played.  
---
😉👍👍👍👍
---
Right now its just a 2x (2.5x with better criticals) for every weapon.
---
This is actually too much for automatic weapons, and not enough for some of the beefiest weapons. Handmade is universally desired. Rocket launcher is not.
---
High rate of fire weapons are now decimating in vats, forcing people to either go sneak or go stealthboys. As user of such gun, I'm okay with my crit shots taking only a half of my opponent HP, not full HP. I'll send next critshot in next half second. I can send four of them in a 2 second timeframe.
---
This is one of the most annoying bugs in my opinion
---
War Rider (t45) is this month, so rejoice.
---
I as someone who just plays for fun. I don’t try for dailies  get them as they come.
---
It's weird seeing people running around dressed as clowns and ringmasters, wearing top hats etc. I just pretend they all escaped from the Allegheny Asylum.
---
Um. Whats a drill really good for? I can’t get the dmg above 4.....
---
it's not leaking, it's irrigating

Sledge should fix brick walls, axe/hatchet - wooden walls, sickle - barn walls, pipe wrench - metal walls

Little late to the party?

You're a bit late to party

I an aa 2 shot 25% fire rate assault rifle so i dont have to rely on the handmade anymore. You know how boring it is using the same twoshot because all your other guns can even begin to compete with it? And the assualt rifle is already weaker than the 10mm sub with perks.
---
I know, I almost always side with them, especially on the first time playing through.
---
Not much. I’ll pm you my ign ;)
---
because that’s how the system works and i already said i think it should be changed. That’s just the way the servers work right now and it’s the way to stop people from griefing you.
---
Who is to say the guy in drag doesn’t belong?
---
Umm. Who dafuq would deliver a nuke to a weird place like that and call it not intentional?
---
A rifle with instigating, two shot, anti armor is impossible. Doesn't exist in game. If your using vats heavily concentrated fire is a necessity, really helps at range. If your using sneak, don't use power armor as well. If your sneaky they will never hit you, therefore making power armor pointless as it actually hurts your stealth. Finally if you want to use crit perks you definitely want more luck so you can use more crits.
---
I haven't had any issues penetrating walls or ceilings. It's just the most trivial job of joining lengths of pipe together to get from one side of an interior wall to the other that is causing me grief. I'll keep trying.
---
They do because i just got one yesterday lol
---
You don't know that.
---
Ah yes, time to fix the corn again. \*eeeeeerrrrrrrrrerrererererererereerer\*
---
But seriously though, it'd be nice to like be a support teammate and help repair random player's camps as you wander by, hell, I'd be content with like a drill healing an object to like 1/8 of its normal health after \[x\] amount of seconds of repairing it, but it can't go any further than 1/8 of its health unless repaired directly from the camp itself.
---
Bone apple teeth
---
Alas, I don't think the crits are the rocket launchers problem. It straight up needs like 100 more damage to justify its existent. It does at much as a melee weapon. Wtf guys.
---
I got a Mounted Wendigo Head Plan as a reward for doing the quest 'That Sinking Feeling'.
---
The last thing I want in my house is a Wendigo head on the wall.
---
Players can still drag powerful enemies to your camp and run away, or nuke it.
---
That change though will fix most of easy griefing.
---
That is what I do with them.
---
Unless you have something 'desirable and tricky to find' like BoS Limbs/Torso, PA BoS paints etc which you may use for trades is just pointless to let them pile up.
---
I usually dump them in there, Flatwoods church cache or the suitcase outside Charleston station.
---
Aw hell yeah. 😍
---
Why don't you do the quest and get it free?
---
Thanks for the input, I appreciate it a ton. To BAE I go! haha
---
Anti armor, 50 percent crit damage, -25 percent ap cost
---
Do they get indebted ?
---
Fly! Fly away!
---
Cyka blayt
---
&gt;cyka
---
сука is not the same thing as "cyka". Write "suka" instead next time :)
---
Boost it with adrenal reaction and lvl 2 demo expert and it does 1080 damage and now i wanna respec to use launchers.
---
Are you a grammar nazi?
---
That’s clearly false. 
---
Now there are two PvP game modes.
---
Message me your PSN I'll craft you some tonight (9pm EST) free of charge that's about 14hrs from now I'm at work :( 
---
Or start the miner miracles quest it's like 20-30 minutes and you'll get the plan. You can do it at your level relatively easily.
---
This technique dates back all the way to the first human settlements in modern day Turkey.
---
Archaeologists use the diffent drill models as means to date the findings when pottery is not available.
---
From what I understand you can pick up and turn in two at a time and it'll give you more caps. 40 instead of the 25 or so one gives you.
---
Don't know if it affects the drops in any way though.
---
I've not been farming it religiously. occasionally just when I log in and before I log out and have managed to get two of the PA paints from it
---
It’s your own problem if you get invested so much in wasting time doing something that is designed to be damaged by other players.
---
I hate myself for missing day one. Just one egg short.
---
These are gameplay tools telling you that you shouldn't horde them like this, it's a steer and it's meant to discourage it.
---
You can hop into a nuked area shortly after the nuke zone disappears and farm it without the radiation.  I’ll watch them on the map and hit them as soon as the zone clears.  It doesn’t last more than a few minutes, but it’ll usually be empty of other players and easy farming.
---
Adrenal reaction with bloodied is like peanut butter and jelly. All im gonna say
---
You specifically attempted to farm a new (presumably legendary) gauntlet, instead of just waiting for a patch??
---
They’ll probably give you the same message they did me which was they can’t replace items in game.
---
The zone can “end”, weather clear up and no radiation but it still spawns glowing ones etc.  Think it’s always been this way... random when it happens and how long it lasts after the nuke marker/weather changes... also the plants can stay as their irradiated versions.
---
And yet every time you enter power armor just about any armor you're wearing clips into it.
---
People don't understand development timelines are sllooooooww.
---
Taking the approach of "it's only a quick easy fix" is exactly how you fuck stuff up.
---
From where ground zero was going to be at (where that lvl 10s camp was) apparntly that nuke launcher doesnt like that lvl 10 too well.
---
Well I won't disagree with your point on the base damage because you are right.
---
The value I see in proposed change is that having this as a variable, not a constant, will allow boosting underwhelming weapons without overpowering decent ones, and to balance overpowered weapons without breaking others. Automatic rifles are now viable without vats, and heavily overperform in vats. I suspect nerf is coming anyway, I just don't want it to be like the TSE nerf back then - that lots of weak nonTSE weapons were made weaker because TSE overperformed. I'd also love if they remained as is when it comes to nonVATS fighting, hence I think their base damage is fine, its just the vats crit that is triggered a little too often and is too strong for that frequency.
---
It lasted for about 30 minutes in my case, but maybe that because other people kept coming and respawing ghouls?
---
I’m with you. I’m level 101 and only have two pieces. Psst. Wanna trade me yours lol.
---
Despite the weird tone, I understand being pissed about this, because it sucks. Since that guy with the bounty probably doesn't have that kind of caps, there isn't a huge reason for them to not be dicks. Seriously though, griefers are a pain in any online game. Luckily the upcoming changes should tone this down a lot.
---
To be honest in Fo4 they seem like the only faction that could truly do something to help the commonwealth, they are more militarised than both the railroad and minutemen also they are probably more liked by the people of the commonwealth than the institute.
---
What are they worth?
---
Server hoping is a shitty game mechanic thats either intended or unintended. INSTANCING is where we need to be.
---
I am 48, my son 12. I got him playing FO3 when he was 8. Someone may consider this not very pedagogic - blood, violence, etc. But  my son didn' get any nighmares, nor did he become violent :) His favorite game (and mine too) is New Vegas. Couldn't persuade him to play FO76, though.  He observed my gameplay and wasn't impressed by Appalachia. When I become a grandddad I will 100% introduce my grandchildren to this wonderful game universe.
---
I still don't see how people are bitching that a repair kit that is literal garbage compared to repairing it at a bench is pay to win. Hell the slightly better version of the kit is rewarded from events and bosses. You all are making a mountain out of a mole hill.
---
Why it doesn’t have an option for a reflex sight and suppressor is beyond me. The stock peep sight is horrific.
---
Heh I missed the second day of the collection so I didn't bother logging in since then. Now if they had one or two more days in it as spares them I probally would have logged in.
---
I basically got cheated out of it because I thought I'd have until the patch to get it but I had to go home from a trip only to come back with it not being there waiting in the atom shop for me :/
---
Added. :)
---
No way, have to check it out.  Even if I stay with PA I'm going to have this in my stash as a trophy.  
---
BTW, what pieces do you have and did you pick this up as loot for buy it?
---
Definitely like the pool.
---
That’s lucky.  I usually get 5-10 minutes.
---
Particularly non-American robots, out of pure spite. Not to mention the name ‘Liberators’ works with the Free States shockingly well.
---
They really like their greens....
---
I can craft you some for free as well if you need it. Just let me know :)
---
What does that matter? A good weapon is good. If you already had something equal or better, you could have given it to someone else.
---
(Had to use google translate for this one.) Crashes like that are really difficult to diagnose without knowing a whole slew of things about your system. Try and use the scan and repair feature within the bethesda launcher for the game. If that doesn't help, can you specify which events? Are you checking your pip boy during the onscreen animations of the events starting and/or ending?
---
&gt; Heavy Searing Sharp Rocket
---
I couldn't find this in the data files and seems to be listed for Fallout 4 nuka world
---
&gt; Searing Puncturing Rocket
---
Same as above
---
&gt; Heating coil
---
Energy damage is currently not considered
---
&gt; Pole Hook
---
Added
---
&gt; War Drum
---
Fixed
---
It is generally difficult to figure out what each mod does as it is burried several indirection deep. I'm considering writing a special tool to extract the details from the game files.
---
You're a bit slow aintcha champ. 
---
1. Repair kits aint in the game ***"yet"***..   
---
2. They could change their mind. And not incorporate them due to such a backlash from Players.  
---
3. Misleading title.. lil' bit of spam for the evening.. Neat.
---
Heh, I was about to reply same.
---
If I were to leave a plan in a mailbox or something in the game, does it stay in that mailbox in that world forever?
---
I don't know what the game was like on release and i don't even want to know but i bought the game recently and i've never seen so many bugs  in a game
---
The mutation is generally not bad. Remember, however, that you will not get rid of it in a controlled manner, and if you decide to use energy weapons later, you may want to remove multiple mutations.
---
Scaly Skin is probably the better mutation.
---
imho are those enemies who can use energy weapons only dangerous if they use ballistic weapons (Gutsies) so there is no particular reason to protect against energy damage off the armor.
---
I don’t even care for this. Tell me
---
Why I see armor in dead raiders and I can’t find these exact some outfits in the world.
---
Only if they had preknowledge about that removal before it was done, and had spread their stuff to different chars.
---
It runs way smoother than on release. Though I miss my stretchy ghouls.
---
Man that spot always has bears or bees now. Sucks because Rad Scorpion meat is great for taking pylons. Guess I'll have to run around the forest and craft another edible instead.
---
Yeah. I gotta say. This is most Raider thing I've seen on here. Honestly it's kinda nice. Better than just greifing people's CAMPs.
---
They had remnants in FNV and their were terminal entries of the enclave, and I think BOS mentioned them in FO4. They are not half the fighting force of FO3 at all.
---
how are the quests? same thing every time with barely any reward?
---
need more content in the game lol
---
Recently i was in a nuke zone. Everything was like it's supposed to be but there was no radiation. Pretty nice
---
Well then wtf am I supposed to keep in my magic pockets, my hands? Get otta heeeere!
---
I was hoping an egg would hatch, or they would be clickable and give a small buff to health or something like that.
---
I have some vanguard’s armor, a heated rocket baseball bat, a combat shotgun, Perfect Storm, a Fixer modified to act as a sniper rifle, and a black powder pistol.
---
Frankly i dont know what people expected from a completely free, obviously Easter related event in the cosmetic shop. Like you’re allowed to not like it, but... genuinely what did you think was going to happen. They’re all cosmetic, CAMP decoration items. It’s not going to trigger an in-game event exclusive to people who got all the eggs.
---
Word, wont matter if a player have a kit or not, you can still be as strong or stronger anyways. Not a p2w in my book
---
I just got a Level 50 Anti armor, explosive Railway rifle. Choo choo (whitesprings)
---
So I just suck then. Got it. Will make improvements.
---
I haven't paid attention to the challenges for kills very closely, but with the challenges for things like crafting or repairing weapons etc. You unlock more specific challenges as you complete them. For example you repair 76 melee weapons, and that opens up the challenge to repair 1 handed and 2 handed melee weapons separately. Is it possible that you completed the pistol challenge and that opened the more specific one for revolvers? Again I haven't looked at the kill challenges very closely so I don't know if they work the same
---
Yep, he could have easily just claimed the workshop and killed over and over but he decided to roleplay, only to be met with some salty sea dogs
---
No, the challenge says "IN UNCANNY CAVERNS".  I just went through the entirety of Tangara Town and killed a dozen of the things just to be sure and absolutely 100% does not count toward this challenge.
---
And it's stated in the posts directly following that that no, it doesn't.  Because the challenge isn't "Kill cave crickets in a cave" it's to kill them SPECIFICALLY in Uncanny Caverns.
---
Alpha Code: 61436701
---
Well like i said, i don't know what was before and which events are new. Though there's a questline that was added recently that triggers an event which is surprisingly difficult. Though otherwise... Most events are really easy and the reward is idk don't expect anything too fancy
---
I've had 1 3* drop for me from the SBQ and it was last weekend. Crashed 2 out 4 times since last weekend; once I couldn't get back in and the other time they killed her and she was empty.
---
I did get Decon plans last night which is nice.
---
I do not run endless SBQs and have a low number of events for her compared to other players who've played since beta.
---
If they will make multiple backpack models work they can do the same for the guns.   
---
Or make it just work with outfits, increasing the value of them, selling more outfis from the atom shop. PROFIT.
---
Picked it up as loot after going thru three nuke zones at white spring. It’s a left arm and chest piece. If ur on Xbox I can show you when the servers go live again. Gt Chnm88
---
Fyi deathclaws do swim!
---
Ok, I can play tonight at 5pm ET
---
She loves to give wood. That's my regular drop from her.
---
Np
---
I leave mine up.  Get visitors most nights.  They grab some fruit, water, use the facilities.  No worries.
---
Only have a tuba for instruments though.  :-/  feel free to make more!
---
Sick gun mate, I would buy it from you if you sold it in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I doubt I'll find my own I'm not that lucky lol. It's nice they can drop with explosive now though, I'm hoping the legendary vendor update will help me finally get the guns I want.
---
You’re in the wasteland 🙄 what do you expect.
---
I'm going to be on before the shut down this morning if you need it.
---
Ok, 9:00 should probably work for me if u cant find someone to do it earlier
---
Is he really the loser for playing the game, or is the person that came here to cry about just seeing him on the map? Pretty awful, negative, and condescending post especially if nothing happened.
---
NCR NCR NCR NCR NCR NCR NCR NCR NCR NCR
---
MY own personal Head canon, MODUS is Indrid Cold.
---
You can see him sometimes, grinning, that scary ass grin. He talks to you but his mouth never moves
---
And instead of Men in Black running around at the same time as all the mothman, flatwoods monster, and indrid cold stuff, you get Mr. Grey, the big bad would of Byyshe, and other secretive agents in Appalachia.
---
Im sorry im leaving for work I cant play this morning. Would anytime tonight work for you?
---
Sorry about your loss on that. With any luck they'll  come back at the latest next Easter.
---
No.
---
On a PC but thanks.  So you got 2 pieces with 3 nuke events?  The RNG gods were looking out for you.
---
For anyone interested in taking a look see

For the longest period I stopped using workshops but like it's the only best way to get plans to decorate camps so like I just want workshops for plans and xp not the resources. I've gotten murdered by people simply for looking at them, or like literally just for the hell of it.
---
Damn. That would make people invincible.
---
I would like to see energy weapons being fixed first. Either giving them way more dmg or some ER penetration mods. After this is done, we can talk about adding new stuff.
---
I give offerings of flaming hot Cheetos every time before playing. Good hunting to you.
---
I'll be on most of the day, I'm med down with back troubles, but probably done by 6 edt
---
Lately when i server hop ive keep getting loaded into the same server. I have to shut down the game and restart if it happens.
---
How get sheepsquatch outfit?
---
No. If my CHA goes below the necessary amount then yes it gets unshared. And when I get back up to the necessary amount I had to reshape the perk.
---
Oh, dear me yes. That would be amazing. You could have police riot shields, bin-lids/garbage can lids, pots-and-pans bucklers: all sorts. Plus, it’s the same engine as Skyrim, so it could be an adapted asset from that. Great idea!
---
And yes: more unarmed weapons. Even if they could just up the drop-rate (I’ve found exactly one power fist in my time, and only a couple of sets of knuckles: it’s mostly mole-miner gloves in my experience) that’d be a start, but if you could use them in power armour... well. That would be sweet. Not too big of a deal in terms of graphical modification either: just replace the power armour glove texture with the powerfist texture, for example. OH MY GOD POWER ARMOURED DEATHCLAW GAUNTLETS!!! 
---
Great suggestions!
---
I know it's a nice idea, but I just really want them to focus on the more pressing issues like redundant gameplay features and bugs
---
I think it’s the dumb way they represent you milling the flour, like the way cooking uses wood in most recipes even in cook fires where the graphics show a gas fire
---
Yes we do.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
The problem with the adds as many have agreed with me is not the damage they deal but the staggering or the fact that they can pull someone out of there caution status.  It seems that the majority of people appreciate add clearing. I know indo when I'm on my high level. Nothings more annoying then trying to shoot at the queen then having a scorched power attack me from behind making my screen go all over the place.
---
Thats what i figured. To many locked door that could have something to do with future enclave or president related stuff. Thanks
---
Lucky bugger. I only got one after hitting lvl 270 in whitesprings.
---
Yeah she flew away with very little health all the way past the game border and we couldn’t snipe her because she was too far away
---
I think you'd have everything by like level 350-ish then.
---
Is that too low though?
---
Nope. Just like there's no way to stop unnecessary threads like this.
---
A fair number of things were fixed including duping and thankfully the abdomen disconnects but you’ll still need a decent amount of patience. There are still crashes, still ways to grief (for now, invulnerable camps unless pvping should help with this), still not much to do in the way of quests.
---
No kidding 5K caps?   “If it bleeds we can kill it” 
---
Forget SBQ I want to go hunting that dude!
---
This is a perfect recreation and i won't lie, it makes me want to recreate Nate
---
Someone should make a thread of characters they've modelled based of others, i'd love to see what's out there from people's favourite franchises etc
---
If you see an empty Whitespring, Invite a very low level player to your team, have them fast travel to you at the Whitespring Station, let them spawn the enemies and they’ll all be the lvl 9 versions dressed up in golf gear.
---
I like both, I think we should have the option to build clean or worn torn. 
---
It’s always bugged (no so much with 76 since it’s in WV and so soon after the war) that decades and centuries after the bombs dropped that people still can’t clean up loose rubble or patch holes in walls. 
---
You can build a nuclear generator and laser weapons but can’t cut the grass?
---
A helpful read for your quest: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ba3oyb/technical_data_hunting_some_tips_and_data/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Funny that all those who love FO76 are on level 1-50. After that there is nothing to do.
---
If you think this is bad you probably would have had a heart attack at release. There were literal hours at a time where you couldn’t play because you’d just keep getting frozen in place while your game tried to reconnect to the server.
---
I managed to get the cricket. That’s it.
---
I just want to point out, even though it's not very relevant to this, that the space station has a "part" that goes into the mountain with a door you can't interact with. Would be nice to follow some prewar astronomer that thought some shits were happening on the station then we get to go investigate.
---
The events are like that. There aren’t many quests and most of the content is reading notes and listening to holotapes. The lack of human npc’s really hurts the game.
---
Hell yes.
---
*cries in Maxson's battlecoat*
---
Bethesda never fails to deliver broken things.
---
what? is that how the bounty system works? the bounty is paid from your own stockpile of caps, and if you don't have enough to meet the bounty then the player collecting it just... doesn't get that much?
---
Alternately you can go through the list of players and block for session every little dot you see.
---
Then no one can see you! Barring they don't have a friend on server so they can just leave server and come back. Or joined up after you block everyone
---
But then you just gotta check the map occasionally for new dots and boop, blocked. And you can feel *mostly* safe.
---
It doesn't stop them from initiating the workshop take over and piping you if/when you come to defend.
---
But it will make it harder for people to seek you out, outside of the workshop.
---
Is the symbol of the items next to the names a mod or what?
---
Alright. I should be on at that time. I'll add you and if you see me online just drop me a message
---
If you are planing a pve and none mutation build, shure, but i would also go with more luck for mutations
---
Yeah that's why i didn't buy it on release. Bugs are basically part of the gameplay mechanics in Bethesda games. I thought if i waited just a few months it would be fine but i was wrong
---
Try and encourage more players to use it. I guarantee they make skins for the most used weapons
---
Wow congratulations on your first nuke!  That is awesome!  I remember mine!  I was so excited!
---
That would be very helpful. Will you be on tonight by chance?
---
It was said around mid-may.. they were going to implement them, but let's see shall we.
---
I’ve found a few pieces too, and I buy them with the intention to sell on reddit. I love power armor so I will never use them myself. I’ve also bought explosive and other good weapons too. People just don’t know what they’re selling.
---
I think the issue is you have 5 distinct groups of players 
---
1) those that PVP 
---
2) those that PVE 
---
3) those that role play (Raiders) 
---
3) those that build (camps)
---
4) those that grief or 
---
F076 isn’t the SIMS.  While I don’t personally destroy camps (unless it’s a turret farm behind WSGC), I understand why some people do.  I used to think it was they were just griefers.  Now I think there’s an element that is just bored of the same old same old so wrecking now becomes a thing.  Chances are they are the same folks that got their asses kicked in Survival mode so this is their new “challenge”
---
I actually expected them to reuse the taming mechanic and just have a deathclaw you could just build in your camp instead of having to tame it
---
My only issue with the broken ear is, why would I craft it like that in the first place?
---
I’m gonna put on the sheepsquatch mascot outfit and beat up anyone who talks crap about it.
---
We ran savage divide maps last Saturday. 3 players and 2 had very high luck builds. Zero BOS plans but we're rolling in rare plans besides BOS.
---
I didn't notice a difference in the luck build part getting better drops but we're pretty casual about data collection.
---
I can clearly recall selling a load of sentinal and cavalier stuff to vendor in my early fo76 days as I thought they sounded ridiculous at the time. Oh well. I've still got a couple of bits in my stash that I didn't realise because they don't have the prefix.
---
Sadly, no.
---
Would be an amazing fix for it, though.
---
No Problem I sent a friend request via the app
---
Another good location is Watoga High School.  The principals office and the computer lab.  I have found Tech Data in the orange round file cabinets there.
---
Oooo.. Burn, someone's a little salty it seems. Haha
---
Golfers should spawn at every level, mainly because finding an empty Whitesprings is like finding a 3* legendary off the SBQ.
---
When it stops bird bones working but boosts marsupial and then every jump you do makes you do that stupid stagger when you land. So annoying!
---
But totally agreed, it's one of the higher priority fixes imo, having to politely tell random teammates to un-share it is pretty annoying.
---
I would sacrifice concentrated fire and some of demo expert and get master gunslinger, bloody mess and better criticals. Using pistols is fine, my wife runs them. The game was super frustrating for her until she learned to master the vats critical shots for quicker kills
---
I see what you did there.
---
Yeah I had a 2 shot with the splitter and auto that thing lasted about 3 to 4 reloads before it would break
---
A nightmare is an understatement but I’m able to have my friends farm lead for me so I can craft it, but bursting and using Vats helps with consumption a lot
---
Do you scrap mass amounts of weapons? If so, there’s a bug where scrapping really quick will temporarily allow you to select other scrappable objects in any other tab, even though you’re in the weapons tab. This is why, probably, people keep losing power armour pieces. Not sure if you can do the same with a frame.
---
I'm upvoting because of the 5000 caps reward.
---
There's something on F76 that I would like to promote, as a game perspective/experience:
---
You are on a post apocalyptic Appalachia. Everyone who lived there is supposedly dead, and there's been sightings of raider attacks here and there.
---
So, if someone f#cks you up, it's mostly a raider attack.
---
if someone helps you, but commandeer your camp and demands ammo/provisions, it may be a brotherhood.
---
If it's some stalking woman that disappears when sighted, it may be from the Order of Mysteries.
---
And if you find someone helpfull, it may be a Responder or Firebreather.
---
I'm not sure if I sound obvious or not (not intended). I was sniped two days ago, hunting mirelurks to get the weekly survival weapon challenge. Got really pissed off. But... it's the damm wasteland. and the raiders are a sure of a problem.
---
They didn’t, you have the imposter sheepsquatch, bone raider skin, I think there is a metal armor paint with blood all over it and I believe it’s called the survivalist outfit, and if that isn’t enough I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Try the sashsquash event, and give the burrows a go. They came out not long ago, and don't forget about the real sashquash, should be coming soon.
---
It has a unique color on the Foregrip, grip, and stock. It’s a small change but it adds personality to the weapon
---
Well, they are both experienced as a sequence of horrible flashing lights, screams, whooshes and bangs...
---
A line in the sand just gets a horrible droning noise as a plus.
---
Thank you for this! I’ve had a crazy couple days, tips like this really help speed up these last minute attempts at getting the dailies!
---
Building can be frustrating but rewarding when it all comes together.

My very thanls GoodNews sir, but I'm mostly an PC player (I have the xbox one too, but I have to do some setup at home to return to console again). I was kind of down with the game these last days. It felt like work, you know? And my character is a hunter/sneak one, so... I think that .50 cool weapon will not be for me... (cryes)
---
This scares the piss out of me in Survival when I think another player is sniping in my area and I immediately run for cover.
---
Don't worry, happened to me also once, just sell the duplicated parts to vendor or scrap them.
---
No I was just trying to unlock the third claw mod at the workbench with a bunch of crafted low level gauntlets so I could have the mod on my level 50(non legendary) gauntlet before the fix but had given up after 13 gauntlets
---
ENOTABUG.
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of Random Number Generation.
---
Rubberduckie, I won't be on until around 1600 eastern time,thanks
---
Thanks. Was just worried they might have thought it was somethung intentiinal, then again its low level stuff and its happened once so they probably wont notice nor care.
---
If you rejoin a friend on that specific server (it doesn't matter if your friend is @ the location, just the same server) it will respawn all the glowing ghouls or which ever enemy was there @ the nuked area (Even if the nuke zone is expired and gone) until your friend leaves that specific server.
---
I used my 2nd PS4 to do this @ VTU &amp; it eventually spawned all legendary eyebots @ Level 1, Level 1 Legendary Gear isn't supposed to be possible, but I have about 30 level 1 Legendary weapons and about 20 level 1 Legendary armor pieces. You can use this gear a soon as you step out of the Vault if you are starting a new Character or for a mule character.

I found him approximately 37 trillion times....when I was hopping for the civil war outfit plans
---
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around...
---
Depending on what rifle you use, you might want to look at grounded for the energy resistance. And I personally like using herbivore, corn/razorgrain soup is really easy to make and provides food and water so speed demon is way easier to deal with, and a lot of the teas and stuff have good extra effects
---
He made wild assumptions about a person's entire upbringing for destroying a fairly easily replaceable, and 100% movable object in a game. Of the 2, I think to insult another person's entire existance is much darker and nastier than shooting up your video game house.
---
Again, it’s not broken, it’s just not sorting it in a different way than the rest of the inv is... 
---
Value would go 10 down to 0
---
Weight 10 down to 0
---
So, food (fresh) would be 10 down to (spoiled) 0. 
---
Again, you want the option to change ascending and descending.
---
New player here. I don't understand the point of camps if people can just come and fuck everything up. Why would I waste my time making something that looks cool if it can get destroyed in seconds.
---
Arrange a mass boycott and uninstall the game until they backtrack
---
But their some extreme loyalists that would actively fight against that I reckon
---
Griefing can be annoying but this comment is really dumb dude
---
Quite simply there is: *QUIT THE GAME, STOP PLAYING* Bethesda will get the message when they start Hemorrhaging money. 
---
So yeah, there's your answer!
---
I didn’t know that either. So taking guerrilla over gunslinger would be ideal in your opinion? I’m just wondering about ammo consumption.
---
chasing noobs
---
Hahahahahaha literally me.. I’m so afraid imma do something 
---
(Like when I’m randomly jumping and spazzing our) I’m afraid imma glitch through the floor cause something unintended and then get banned lmao
---
Yeah, I was expecting more meat to these quests. 
---
What’s your hybrid build?
---
"You open a closet, its just a closet. You can never find the monster that hides inside. Not until it jumps out at you."
---
This game is one big mess anyway, few days ago I've given nice LVL5 Fire Axe to the guy, who asked me to modify his non-legendary baseball bat (that LVL5 fire axe was better than LVL15 bat). Three day later I found it again in my stash (unmoded version - one I've gave to other guy was modded). So you know, karma is giving back ...
---
You get a few hours where you don't do any damage to other players tho. Sucks
---
VATS Crits I find are the only way to kill assassin sentinel players, I believe the vats Critical damage penetrates it. The only time I can kill a sentinel build player is when I Crit his head from sneak, the damage seems to apply normally then. If we nerf vats Crits we buff sentinel builds
---
melee and rifles
---
So true! And when I do actually get to play, I’d focused around joining their world, fast traveling to them...crash, do process over again and their went 20 min of game time. Unreal...haha
---
Will the teas not work with carnivore? I run into meat more than anything.
---
*Sounds like a American revolution and we know how that turned out*
---
Wastelander: Hey don't hate on us we like to be fashionable! 
---
*Runs away in my clown outfit.*
---
Very good perspective!
---
I would take the level 25 weapon you have if you are looking for a home for it. I do enjoy ski swords. I am level 32 now, so I don't want to grab anything for level 35 yet.
---
I appreciate it man!
---
Doesn't staggering cancel out Sentinel?
---
Think he meant to learn the mods for third claw.
---
Yes, I have a blast playing the game. Meeting some awesome down to earth people from this game.
---
it turned out, the OP deleted his user.. Lol
---
If you have Super Duper modding PA will trigger the perk.
---
Im 99% sure you cant get the rocket concrete on other super sledges
---
He was in adventure mode. 
---
I saw him too. 
---
On PC.
---
Agreed, if it was too easy, everyone would have it. But there are still many different builds to keep the variety different
---
word. u got an xbox? let’s play
---
I think the extra effects work, but they don't provide water because they are plant. The main thing for me is that the soups are really easy. I grow corn in my camp next to a river, and i can just make 15 soup at a time for water and food. And unless its a bug, I've used meat and still got the bonus effects from it with herbivore
---
Nope, but Bethesda will introduce soon a new pink skirt in Atomic shop. Hopefully it will help your problem.
---
Did not know you could learn that
---
Repair kits taint any adjustment to junk, scrapping, or condition degradation.  When they get adjusted, was it for game balance reasons, or revenue reasons?
---
I want game designers balancing my games, not accountants.
---
I dont think you can get super duper till like level 50.
---
Would be fine, for there reason you note (actual builds) if non-combat perks were passive once acquired.  *Constantly* going into the perk menu because I'm crafting.  Selling.  etc. and occasionally forgetting to put on something has been a huge turnoff for me.
---
There's just no reason to do it that way.  Who the fuck cares if selling prices is slotted or not?  There's no drawback or advantage, only a penalty if I forget to switch it back among all the tedium - being punished for a bad design choice is fucking stupid and not fun.
---
Also, not being able to lower a card's rating once I have a max version is just another huge oversight in a game full of rushed design and poor choices.
---
A +swing speed Bloodied Hunter’s baseball bat. I’m playing as a wasteland chef.
---
I haven’t seen anything mentioned regarding improvements yet in any of the “inside the vaults” planned stuff as of yet, I miss the select all of FO4 too tbh. I hope they do improve the selection of camp objects especially with concrete foundations. I had to dismantle part of my camp to get rid of some subway lights I attached to them because they would not highlight. Someone yesterday posted that a concrete foundation had become inaccessible when it had accidentally placed below a water line and they could not select it for scrapping. Perhaps someone could tag the community managers on this post as I’m sure it’s driving a lot of us to distraction.
---
Yes, that happened to me only yesterday, I eventually finished the event 25 minutes later. It also once happened that the enemies spawned outside the defend your workshop zone and I couldn't find them. I looked for probably half an hour until I eventually saw them far away, when I approached to kill them I excited the event zone and triggered the 'retake your workshop' event, since the game thought I failed because I left the zone.
---
I nuked it twice, two out of two crash to desktops when approaching the front place. Watoga was also guaranteed crashes for me. So far, mainly hit Prime and Whitesprings and they were almost always stable (like 1 out of 25 nukes).
---
Understood, but how am I even supposed to enter the market when the drops are 1* wooded nocturnal items? I guess I need to keep grinding for better stuff
---
I'm not too worried about that as I'll just jump server at the very last moment after blocking them. However i have to say for all the time I have been playing I've only had two incidents where someone tried to grief me, so for me it's been an incredibly rare occurrence
---
I'm not using it to kill things. Just a debuff to freeze big things like SBQ and ISS. 3 star bloodied though. 500 rounds gets me a couple fights if I switch back to gatling or 50 cal once they're frozen.
---
Way I'm playing a game that has mechanics I don't like, but I'm still playing it and want people to agree with me on the internet!
---
Posts like this need to be deleted.  Rule fucking 7.
---
It happened to me after I got blue screened one night, duplicated my excavator and the suit of Ultracite Power Armor I just got from end BoS mission
---
The real end game content is here in Reddit.
---
I didn't know this
---
Platform?
---
As fun as that would be that would probably never be free.
---
During the Fasnacht event, I had my guy run round wearing the swimsuit.
---
I’m level 125 and always find things to do. Some nights I pop on just to do my caps run and a challenge or four, and some days I’ll spend hours just running around doing events, hitting nuke zones, or just hanging out with people I play with and sprucing up my camp. Last night we dressed up in the rabbit head and clown suits and ran across the map hitting each other with commie whackers, until 2 people decided to attack us...but we still had fun.  There’s always something to do 😁
---
I could be wrong. Though I don't have the perk anyway.
---
I always give that to paladin danse to wear lol.
---
Yes, staggering counters it too. I should have mentioned that. There are some perks that make this easy to do. Also I heard radiation damage is a good counter to them too
---
See below.
---
Sounds good. Will add you tonight.
---
Fairly certain it’s a game, but hey, I guess some people take it more seriously than others, eh?
---
Probably a hunting rifle with Instigating/+50% limb damage/15% faster reload.
---
I would love a clean suit set because idk if it’s just me but I have that view of the guy in a suit, bandanna and shades walking away from a explosion in slow-mo
---
If you are on pc Id pay 10k caps and give you another 3\* weapon.

I switch between pistols (when I want to shoot) and running around dropping mines and bombing the crap out of the mobs I've gathered up. 
---
It isn't as "easy" as my melee guy and takes more investment, but it's fun.
---
Had it happen on pc day before yesterday.
---
I’ve heard they won’t spawn over a certain level. I don’t know if that’s true, or how it hasn’t been fuckin’ fixed. I saw the golfer ghouls ONCE. I’ve been stuck at 7/10 for around three months now.
---
That was a good video , cool that I'm in it . New subscribers now . Bethesda really put salt in everyone's mouths now I feel . Their falling from the good Grace's really quickly inky opinion . It's sad because they have shown that they can make such great games but the greed seems blinding .
---
Yeah, SBQ was a let down ending  for sure. I heard that a lot of people like finding others to help out, which is great. But my focus is that the way to get the legendary gear I want is so difficult that I spend more time here than I do there.
---
I got it done on my main that I deleted because I found out that my build was definitely not what I wanted since I just grabbed what I wanted instead of saving points and building right.
---
I say you put all your guns in the void, and summon them when you require their use.

NO ONE DARED TO ASK HIS BUSINESS
---
NO ONE DARED TO MAKE A SLIP
---
Talking in PVE you can one hit kill almost everything, im using BE handmade, BE lever and now B Gauss (still need to find the BE one) and a B Knuckles for some close enemies, all in stealth so it can 2.50x the damage.
---
half the time i enter or exit my PA, I come out from the side of it. So clipping would not bother me at all
---
how are you with circuitry with regards to lighting and traps etc.?
---
I could just imagine it as it seems to fit with their current strategy of rummaging around for content to recycle and slapping some theme on it.
---
fusion cores are considered ammo
---
and
---
you cannot sell ammo to vendors.
---
The Tesla I have is Nocturnal tho but it has 50% limb damage and 15% faster reload.
---
Handy enough have done it for a few people
---
I’ve seen the mod before, over never seen it in use
---
There is one more way that lazy jerks could give your base a scowering after the patch.  It look from the delelopers notes that players that are not hostile to you or your turrets won't be able to do damage to your base, but what if he picks one of your locks?  He gets a bounty, your base becomes hostile, he levels it, and then either has a friend kill him for some free bounty caps or he goes into PVP with a free "come and get me so I don't have to actually work to find other players" target on his map marker?  
---
TL;DR Any base with a pickable lock might still become hostile and consequently can then be leveled by a greifer after the invulnerability patch.
---
😂😂😂
---
We get the camera today so calm down
---
Probably the one for the sledgehammer, not the super sledge is what i would guess
---
It doesn't show up on the compass, so just keep going south toward a slanted house and a bog. Be careful, though! A mirelurk queen was there when I just found it. Thanks for the tip. Got 18 cranberries with Green Thumb!
---
Nope, no quest. Just upstairs at the Whitesprings. Can be a pain to find the first time though.. didn't even know it was there for the loooongest time
---
I like this idea
---
Lmao, I had that happened a few days ago. Going by whitesprings trying to find unruly golfers to kill and thia nigga comes in out of nowhere just starts constantly drilling me. As this is happening, ghouls are coming out of the wood works and two scorched beast decided they wanted to party to. I'm trying to handle ghouls, not get blasted, and there's just this lvl 132. Just drilling at me.
---
Then my game crashed.
---
"The Guarantee" is literally that, it was the survival weekly challenge reward last week, Instigating limb damage reload speed fat man with mirv mod. 
---
This week should be "the action hero", two shot rapid fire +damage while aiming .50 cal mg.
---
Was this on PC and his name was "cabbage" something or other?
---
You can’t sell ammo and fusion cores are ammo so you waisted time darmimg them a better farming method would be water farming purified water or selling junk in bulks
---
Depends on how you define well adjusted and successful.
---
Ah! Shhiiiiiit! I wish I had known
---
All the recent challenge changes that make it far harder to do them has turned me from purchasing atoms from the store.  If that's what Bethesda is hoping - sorry, I don't condone these sort of practices.  Would have spent for atoms already if it wasn't for the challenge changes including broken ones that can't be completed, repair kits, etc...  your greed will turn people away just like how EA basically blew up Battlefront 2 because of their intended microtransactions.
---
As cool as that would be.. Most likely not gonna happen. Im quite sure they won't be adding anything from other games than fallout 4 and it's dlc's. Because of copy/paste reasons.
---
Probably, they need to label them better, happy cake day btw
---
Don't forget in PVP
---
So it might be even worse ... Oh Boy \^\^
---
Believe me if I could destroy more of Bethesda made structures I would.
---
I did see someone on the boards looking for a Fallout wife yesterday 🤷‍♀️
---
Yellowcake flux is the easiest to get.  
---
  One run through a WS nuke zone should yield everything you need.
---
My camp is at Whitesprings (no, nowhere near the golf club) and I like to go pick up the golf balls sometimes when I need a little plastic but cbf going to Morgantown High. Especially at that bit of grass around the rear end of the resort where there's heaps of golf balls you really have to look hard to make sure you found them all and it always felt like a bit of an egg hunt. I thought a big egg hunt event across the greens with randomized locations would have been really cool, like a real egg hunt with players racing around to collect them all.
---
Thank you for your help
---
Btw, do you use the name I created , GhostRider. Or my account name, deworley,?
---
As much as i would love this they won'y be doing that (in my opinion). Reason being Bethesda and their ability to do things.
---
I can sell you 5 for.. 250c? Not sure what valuea are, either. Add DemWafflez if intrested.
---
&gt; i love urban/forest wastelands
---
The setting, stories and monsters are what make Far Harbor and Point Lookout my favorite parts of the game. I'm currently in love with The Mire because of the dark forest setting, though I haven't had the opportunity to go through all of it yet.
---
Yes. It's icon sorting tags mod
---
Most of the Atomic shop items are already out of context. This is because Bethesda is no clear plans how to develop this game. It looks more and more that there is just few summer trainees doing what ever they want and they seem to like furries.
---
That would be amazing.
---
I wish I knew way back when. I'm sure I've tossed a many sentinel and Cav gear over the many levels before I knew its value. Now I have probably 6 misc pieces now but only use 1.
---
How dare you, you cretin, the drill is obviously the most superior weapon, move aside anything else, the drill has got your back.
---
I love mine, I would have paid atoms for it tbh, so many folk were hyping themselves up posting that they hoped a deathclaw would come storming through their camp to reclaim their eggs or the eggs would hatch baby deathclaw’s etc but at the end of the day Easter = Bunny’s &amp; Eggs not rampaging deathclaws so for me my expectations were met and I’m completely thrilled with my bunny head 🐰😁
---
I don't think crafting or selling should be part of a build, imo builds should only consist of combat perks or (if the game demands it) speech abilities to promote pacifist solutions.
---
Are you on Xbox yes
---
Here's a thought.. **GET GOOD NOOB**
---
It's the same game you played before, on more stable servers.
---
I fail to see how this solves the problem.
---
nope, PS4
---
Pre patch 8, it hovered around 40% but post patch, it is [close to 20%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=717308889) and overall 5.5%.
---
dont think its an issue
---
ESO does the same thing
---
You definitely should
---
You cant, its a mod attachment only.
---
1. I disagree that it should use AP. You have to be still for it to work, so you're an easy target if you were spotted getting into postition. Agree on the second point. Since there's no muzzle flash from ballistic weapons, there's no way to spot where a shot came from, so there's no incentive to actually find a good hiding spot.
---
2. Disagree. Since stealth boys are consumables, they are a finite resource. That being said, a potential compromise is to have regular stealth boys work as you suggest, and allow players to upgrade them using a rare resource (maybe flux) to create an advanced version that keeps you stealthed when firing.
---
3. Admittedly, I don't completely understand how the assassin sentinel armor works now. But if it works the way  I think it does, having the pieces only provide the legendary effect on the parts being covered could be a potential fix. That way, even with a full set, the head is always a weak spot.
---
4. No opinion, as I have no idea how VATs Crits actually work in the game. I just use them when I remember I have one.
---
5. I recently ran into a potential exploit. I haven't experimented with it yet, but I believe a player found me, blocked me for the session, and then began attacking me. This made him permanently invisible to me (not even a stealth shroud) and berry mentats were useless. You may have run into this.
---
6. Haven't used or fought against one, so no opinion.
---
7. This one is...complicated. Taking away the ability to quickly (1/2 shots) kill someone I got the drop on would make my stealthy sniper worthless.  At the same time, I dropped a guy just a couple levels higher than me (84/87) in a full suit of PA. Took two shots from my Sole Survivor. I've been 1/2 shot plenty of times by people with exploding weapons. I don't think players' natural DR/ER should match a robot's or super mutant's, because they're still just a squishy human. But I do think the DR system in PvP needs another look.
---
Dont forget to visit garrahan for the excavator power armor
---
I love fixing my brick walls with my trusty sledgehammer. Nothing does the job better
---
Yea this shit happens alot. I encountered a bug where a legendary weapon i recieved as a reward started duplicating itself in my inventory like mad. Everytime i opened my inventory there were 1-2 more. Eventually had a paper bag of 17 dupes on it.
---
And no! Im not telling anyone how this was triggered. You duper scums won't be duping nothing using this method. Not for a millions dollars and the secret will go to my grave (near whitesprings). We have had enough duping to ruin economy already.
---
I don't think that new players respawn enemies anymore. At least in my experience. Definitely not like the old days when your buddy would log out and rejoin the server. I believe they set it to a timer now for server stability. Just my opinion though
---
Yes, I was pvping with a berserkers, bloodied musket and shot at some dude in vats. Made the noise. No damage given. Mind you this thing one shots people so the fact that there was 0 damage confirmed for me it does work even against vats.
---
I've found 3 pieces in like 200 hours. Although I was level 50 before I figured out the inspect button. Lol. I've found some good stuff at vendors people mistakenly sold. Nice find!
---
Has there actually been any confirmation that the mod issue will be fixed in the maintenance today
---
People like you are the reason for server instability, Throw those notes and tapes on the ground and let them die, they all respawn where they are needed, having 1000 weightless notes in your stash noticeably effects the stability of your stash, get rid of the damn things.
---
Partial /S
---
Seriously though, the more things you have the laggier it is, and notes weighing nothing lets you hold way more than you realize.
---
Why are you shooting in third person...?
---
You on PC? I can do the acoustic instruments and pianos for you
---
I wear unyeilding armor and while I have noticed the first glitch, I've never encountered the second.
---
Because I don’t like to play in 1st person.
---
I put my controller down for a second to get some water. I came back and there were 2 level 130’s in my base who had killed both me and my friends who were only level 25. I’ve been griefed non stop
---
I think we just found yongyea's reddit account
---
You Sir are a Monster! How can you do this! Are you out of your mind :D
---
Sweet gnomed Alabama
---
I think survival would be more fun with no legendary stuff. Sure I  love the cool loot but it's too hard to balance survival with it.
---
Sweet home northern france
---
I’m also wondering what happens if you have a responder outfit on when it shows up, I’ve never been wearing one when I’ve seen it lol
---
I mean, that's a pretty dumb argument. If there's a 3rd person PoV, it should be fully playable.
---
I believe there had been
---
Temporary fix:
---
Create your own reticle using string taped to the top and sides of you screen or taped across the diagonals.
---
the magic pocket is the underwear dude . if u take all clothes where do the weapons go .. in the underwear. haha
---
I'm pretty sure they actually did that
---
The bunny makes for a great combo with a suit while walking around with a weapon of mass destruction
---
I wanted that mask to be more Donnie Darko and less Broke Bugs Bunny
---
Have the same problem myself, and I play melee, so its always a small dot - but the up close and personal nature of melee mitigates that problem (to a degree)
---
I'd guess it's another dose of simulated reality - open/iron sights are more difficult to see the target, especially at distance - the sight post/dot is larger than the target.
---
Reticle dots are easier to get on target, but at distance, obscure the target.  scope are better for slow fire/precision shooting.
---
For ballistic weapons, unless I'm sniping, I don't shoulder the weapon - I hip fire.  
---
At least in hip fire, you have the red "+" when the target is in range.
---
You’re joking but I know [this is a thing.](https://www.google.pt/search?q=reticle+for+screen&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;prmd=ivsn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAw6_MnObhAhWTAGMBHc1QDwAQ_AUoAXoECAwQAQ&amp;biw=320&amp;bih=438)
---
 Yes it's possible I got a full set of assasins and a full set of sentinel through normal grinding. I got them in survival mode.
---
I've lost about a dozen items out of my stash to include legendary weapons, armor, and aid items over the past couple weeks.
---
It's a bit if a double edged sword. Yesterday I was on my alt and some level 80s come over and start to mess with me and my other character which is acting as a mule. They got chased off because they got wanted for destroying my walls.
---
I love these moments!  I'm wary whenever anyone walks into my camp because it gets blown up so often (still a lowbie without too much special going on with my camp, which means repairs are cheap so it's only slightly annoying).  But one day a level 130+ walked up and started chatting instead of shooting.  He made me a bunch of stuff, gave me some tips on my character build, complimented my camp and then just went off on his merry way.  A half hour earlier another guy had destroyed my camp with a drill, so it was a nice change of pace.
---
I nuked it 3 times; once crashed to desktop before entering the Steakhouse, once I crashed on the road leading up to RobCo. The third time, server not responding after I cleared out the place - all loot rolled back (nothing special, 1-2 1\* legendary armor).
---
[This is the big announcement post you want.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
I wasn't making any argument, I was wondering why he prefers to shoot in third person rather than first.
---
My guess is she was a legendary spawn of her. So yes the legendary ai has her "hide" so her minions can fo work. Just my guess though.
---
So edgy
---
Pumkin grenades are really easy to come by and sitting still in a cloud of high radiation isn't going to last long.
---
Below North Park
---
That’s what my good friend does too, he suggested me to go melee too.
---
But an option wouldn’t hurt anyone and would open to game to be more enjoyable, notable example is Gears of War.
---
For example moving targets, I can only hit them using VATS, and that’s a shame.
---
Filthy casual mode in valid. And for the price cdkey stores are selling this game (cheapest i've seen has been 8e) i see no reason not buy it and try the game. It has gotten alot better than it was at lauch, still a buggy mess but still.
---
Get it as soon as it's availible. It kicks in way more than advertised. You can really stock pile stimpacks (with chemist) and ammo with it.
---
I didn’t find out about the eggs till the second one was out. But honestly after seeing the Easter bunny mask I’m not disappointed I missed out
---
You have to check - some pieces are broken, some are good.
---
If you're Level 25 do the Miner Miracles quest and get the Excavator Armour. If you've not picked it up already you should find a poster for the quest outside The Rusty Pick (just south of the Charleston Fire Station). You'll need plenty of Black Titanium to make it though.
---
Indeed it does. Perfect name. Heh, give them some of the same voicelines as their vendor bot, and a new paint job, and that’s a pretty simple add-in, I think.
---
I dont get why they would eggspect more. Its literally just a prize for opening fallout every day.
---
They do stuff like that because they can't hack it in survival.
---
And Rolling pin\* should make Perfectly preserved pies :)
---
This has happened in every Bethesda game.
---
Shooting arrows in third person in Skyrim was a pain in the ass.
---
I really hope this vendor is awesome and that the tokens become a core tradable currency, replacing caps altogether for player trading and being preferred over item trades.
---
I think I will just scrap mine, but having a duplicating legendary would be a pain in the ass.
---
I wonder if they will also add modifications like they had for robots in the Automotron DLC for Power Armor. Likes bags and storage space.
---
Two shot explosive quad BINOCULARS
---
I don’t recall tbh, but yeah, 3rd person normally gets the shaft.
---
Yeah I got griefed over the weekend as well.
---
Walked off with some mats not the needed ultracite but I still need violet flux
---
Ps4 sorry good person
---
You cannot scrap Legendary Items
---
 I feel u. :P
---
Well, it does say were so past tense.
---
This is a whole new level of "all I got is this T-shirt"
---
Herpes Fury. Home of the Burrow(ing itch)
---
Forgot to mention I'm on PS4. So how would rate the games recovery compared to say No Man's Sky?
---
Wicked:)
---
If you have a melee weapon, it's got the sacrificial blade mod. Hard to say what it's worth without knowing what the other effects are.
---
If you have a gun, take that piece of shit scorched killer reciever off it and it will be worth more, whatever the other effects are.
---
Some of the problem is that you're making a hybrid of pistol/explosives.  Going into one or the other is going to give you a lot more traction against tougher enemies.
---
[This is what I'd do, personally.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3814aff&amp;d=p02e10cf2ak2ad2lr2l71lu2lt2lv2al2cd0sg2pe2ib4ic4l10a32pq1a72&amp;w=&amp;n=Needs%20a%20transition&amp;m=2859c)
---
It goes as heavy as you can into a pistol/vats build and leaves some AoE funtime and extra damage for grenades.  Demo Expert will also boost the damage from the explosive effect you're eventually gonna want on your pistol.  Grenadier will also boost the AoE of the explosive pistol, as well.
---
The 3 points in STR for blocker can be swapped with Traveling Pharmacy for weight reduction when not fighting hard enemies.  Trust me, you're going to want Blocker when fighting deathclaws, yao-guai and packs of ghouls.
---
You can get a lot of weight reduction off legendary armors, so I don't waste valuable perk points on weight savings if I can help it.  That being said, you can always swap in Traveling Pharmacy and Thru-Hiker to cut down enough to fast travel.  As long as you're not a hoarder you should be fine.  No one needs 200 stimpaks on their person, unless you plan on carrying a lot to also stim your teammates with Team Medic.  In that case, Traveling Pharmacy might be a more valuable option.  Alternately, you could drop a couple points of Gunsmith and a point of CHA to bump your STR up to 6 and have both Blocker and Pharmacy. 
---
Pistols and VATS synergize very well, which is why I suggest this kind of build.  With so many crits available, you're going to be able to lay down some pretty serious firepower.
---
Keep in mind that using VATS in power armor will burn up your fusion cores like candy, so potentially swapping in three ranks of Power User (INT) when you're forced to use power armor at the expense of three Gunsmith ranks is probably wise.
---
I'd just like some more LMG's in general lmao
---
The marine wetsuit looks phenomenal with BOS combat armor and a Sentry Bot helmet.
---
Thanks for that, I wondered what was happening with that big ass thing being held up in the air, auto grenade melee 🤨
---
I see this a lot around cranberry bog and those AA gun sites when scavenging ballistic fibre.
---
I agree. I think they are way too strong for pvp
---
The other one is Military Fatigues.
---
The jumping and sent still being active is the real problem.  If you have any sort of build, you can take down a player standing still with staggers etc.
---
Disciples gear from fallout 4s nuka world would be pretty cool.
---
I want a legion kit...
---
I will describe my opinion. I was started to play at release day and bored after completed quests and quit. I started to play again after 2019 road map and I enjoyed too much.
---
They are adding something every week or two weeks. They are trying to improve. Also, If you mind about community, you will find good community there. Also suggest you to learn game at Adventure mode.
---
I feel like the guy was just rp-ing a raider and you just took it too serious lol as you said, its just a game

---
nope, was removed a few patches ago
---
Yes, and the reason they can’t be sold to vendors is because Bethesda wants you to do an event, then say “hey I got this plan I already know, anyone want it? I’ll sell it for x caps, cheaper  than the vendor version”
---
I just think an even playing field would be more fun long term. Also everyone should start over with no carry over stuff from other characters.
---
Funny man. 
---
I just paid 80k for it.
---
I also noticed that the red cross is further apart when hip-firing with a scope attached compared to when I hip fire with Reticle sights.

You can plant them on dirt and then use rugs to move them inside or on tables. I believe this method still works!

West Tek, Harper's Ferry + The Burrows [seem to be decent](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=197047020). All other locations are mostly occasional or tied to timed events.
---
this has so far been my only experience with 76. I have only met nice helpful people and whenever I see newer players I try to drop some ammo and aid for them because I remember how frustrating it was getting ammo in the early game.
---
I remember when I came out I was just thrilled that they had actually filmed it in Point Pleasant
---
EA bad, Bugthesda bad, CDPR good.
---
Youuuuuung out !
---
Lol I've literally got hundreds of lead and I'm almost 30 levels lower than that guy. I can get being low on springs but lead?
---
I was being serious, I use a sticky-note as my character has the weightless armor and therefore the whole dot reflex site disappears which makes aiming very hard without VATS.
---
&gt; It has been mentioned in multiple posts (that get little to no visibility, as you shall see with yours).
---
because most of f76 is casual . so they request stupid shit. and actual posts about the game bugs are not upvoted
---
I think so. You are probably better off dropping them in the overseers cache at the camp.
---
The friends list has a little camp fire icon next to the people in survival mode.
---
Sounds ok....
---
Lol I’m the complete opposite, once a group goes past 4 I leave the chat, team, etc. Personally gets too rowdy for me with all the overlapping voices.
---
Bug, join a new server.
---
Oh.... I admit you got me.
---
Didn’t know about that too, will consider using one, thanks for sharing.
---
If you liked Fallout 4, you'll like this. I rarely have any negative encounters with other players, no matter what their level. In any world you go you'll see all levels running around, from brand new players to level 200+. I don't know if you'd call me a casual or not since I play most days, but I don't take it as seriously as some do and I have great fun on my PS4.
---
Can I just add that I think it's ridiculous that Bethesda have left the camera challenges up knowing that they're impossible. 
---
The only valid reason they're acting naive to the issue is because if we're earning less we'll have to buy more.
---
This isnt recent, I've had it happening to me since November, along with extremely low levels spawning for me. My husband used to laugh at it and say it was just me, but it recently started happening to him now as well.
---
I have always run a sniper build with no major changes to my build or gameplay style since day one. My husband used to run a tank/melee build but recently switched to a sniper build similar to mine. His theory has been equipment level in your inventory effecting it, but I dont know.
---
Love the idea. I hope it gets attention
---
It's the same game you played before, but with better servers.
---
Should i wear a green shirt instead of blue one?
---
They were open last night. I'd guess it's just that the door failed to load, which happen's on Biv's Nukashine bar or the Taxidermy shop. Did it stay closed after a server hop?
---
But hustling a couple of lvl 20-30s when you're almost 5 times their level? I can get being a raider isnt really a moral rp but that's just ultimately toxic. If you want to rp as a raider at least pick on someone at least half your size. He just wanted some lead to go along with stealing a guys workshop.
---
I just want to see how fast the LMG will shoot with a +25% fire rate increase. I have a two shot LMG right now and it's terrifying. The brotherhood would have demolished everything in their path if they used rusty WW2 guns instead of those shitty laser rifles
---
r/BoneAppleTea
---
It’s a sad thing. These posts are becoming all to common. These items represent hours, days , even weeks of grinding and effort to obtain and to have that wiped away in an instant is a bitter pill to swallow. I’m a die hard fallout fan and have been for years but this has caused me to back away from the game if for nothing else to decide if I can choke that pill down.
---
I believe there’s a 76 podcast with some folks from WV.  Not sure the name of it.
---
Might be right, I think I've maybe done it once all the way through, and joined it like two other times.
---
I took over all 3 power plants for a majority of the day last weekend for fusion cores. I server hopped until I found a server with very few people and most of them much lower level than me (125).  I was lucky enough to not get attacked at all.  But before I take over workshops I jump around and check to see who’s on the server. As for junk, I scrap and store mine constantly. Even if I’m in the middle of farming, I’ll stop to fast travel to the closest station or my camp to scrap &amp; store just in case.
---
Even if they don't want to do the full animations, it would still be cool to have larger weapons on the back or pistols and small melee weapons on the hips. The animations for readying the weapons can stay the same.
---
Lol...right. That thing 1 shots me with its rotating arms of death almost every time, no matter what set up im running.
---
I know this is used vs the SBQ, but I cant imagine if sheepspuatch was stronger for a min!!
---
thank you for everything you've done for science
---
Yeah I know right? My jaw dropped to the floor. Not sure if I am going to sell it yet.. have to do some more testing. Off the bat it one shotted all the highest level Super mutants at West Tech. Note that This is my first explosive drop after ca 100 hours of farming. Big hopes for the Legendary too. My Stashbox can't handle more legendary stuff
---
I found four player squads limiting at launch, but haven't had a problem in a long time as players reached endgame and drifted to other games. A few perk cards would need to be reworked (having 7 shared cards would be remarkable), but it could be done.
---
Yeah, but I can't fast travel there for free. My generosity has its limits.
---
You picked a lock in an owned workshop. Got wanted. That's the system working as intended. Now you know.
---
I dress fancy
---
I'm level 185 right now, and only found a single piece of sentinel's armor recently. Also one piece that reduces damage by 15% while sprinting, and one while blocking. I'd love to know how long it would take people to have full sets, for any amount of trading, if duping wasn't a thing
---
1☆ Legendaries are rather common and it's rare but not unheard of to get 2 in the same event.
---
I’ll be on tonight gt same as name. You’ll be 35 before you know it lol
---
Yes!  It's amazing how many pleather people don't even understand about the zippers.  But if chaps arrive can we please get new underwear?!
---
That would be legit! Let’s hope Bethesda is reading
---
I agree with being able to sell to vendors. Somewhere out there someone accidentally picked up a BOS Combat Armor legs that they have no need for and I do. Most likely  dropped them in a train station suit case or on the side of the road right before they logged off. At least give me a chance to buy them from the vendor.
---
The bag may break if no one is around - however I have dropped a bag in front of a friend and left and the bag was still there after I left the server. But if no ones around the server might eat it
---
Lighting bug. When I have a charged assaultron head, even when it's holstered, opening my pip boy gives me a red strobe light
---
Helped so much thank you
---
Pretty sure I got the sheepsquatch mascot head, the cheesy common white one too. This whole event was a joke. 6 days for the most common drop at the Encryptid event? Dafuq Bethesda?
---
There is a limit, it was put in the last CAMP update.  The reduced the budget cost of lights/turrets but put in a limit.
---
Lol, Irrelevant. Downvoted for boring negativity
---
I have found plans at the bench in the prison, but not BOS yet,  
---
I found BOS arms at the locker in the steel yard, as well as a couple of others
---
I have yet to find any kind of plans at the armor bench at top of the world   
---
any other locations I can add to this search?
---
Nope. No effect on drops.
---
Haha
---
Or open up a bank with a small stash limit to transfer between accounts
---
Drop them in the overseers stash in the overseers camp
---
Cheers people, 2 days of grinding the north western most building at Grafton Steel eventually got them to spawn. I saw BoS plans spawn in too if people are still looking for them
---
Just learn how PvP works, and avoid it until you know what you're doing. It's possible to play &gt;95% PvE cooperative, so it won't be a problem that you're new. Several of my friends have created alts to test other builds and items, so you'll find there's lots of low-level characters who magically seem to know what they're doing. 
---
I really enjoyed exploration in this game, but there's still a number of bugs and no enjoyable endgame loop, so it's best to dial down your play-time as you get near the end.
---
I stayed to and the nuke hit, nothing happened. Then me and my house were just destroyed.
---
They would have been written before F76 was even launched so pretty much out of date after the first week
---
I duped a fully modded set of level 15 Raider power armor. I have no idea how... one minute I had one in my inventory and the next I had two. They both went to alts in my circle of friends and are still floating around. This was before the vendors started selling plans so the original set was upgraded with mods. Weirdly enough I also did the same thing at the same time to a set of level 25 T-45 and it did not dupe.
---
I believe I server hopped over 30 times to find my rad scorpions...
---
How do we actually get the mascot bunny mask? I got all the eggs, but last night nothing happened, nothing in store
---
That tip about Psychobuff - damm, that's why I'm almost dead all of a sudden on my bloodied build!  Will have to switch which character uses which and move Psychotats to my bloodied.  Is there even a way to craft Psychotats?  I do mild bloodied - no Nerd Rage, usually around 30% health, but not in power armor a lot.
---
One more add - don't forget alcohol for damage boosting...  Ballistic Bock &amp; High Voltage Hefe are easy enough to craft.
---
I nuked it. Went there first. All glowing ones already dead. Fuck this place.
---
The only downside to invulnerable camps is when players camp near rare spawn points. They need to put no build zones at these areas.
---
No. Every person that has "proven" it at best had terrible methodology for data collection and interpretation, and at worst had no real data and just goes with personal experience, which is not inherently truthful because human memory and  is inherently flawed. It's as "proven" as the infamous "Stealth Nerf" that went around, or the "fact" that the SBQ gains health when more people shoot it. I'm not even entirely sure if the old Preserved Pie machine game is still luck based in this version of Fallout, people assume it is based on Fallout 4, and with such garbage odds, it's hard to accurately test it.
---
They respawn after 10 minutes?
---
Meh, thats when you just hop to the pve server till the time is up, rinse and repeat.
---
Though being honest pvp in this game is beyond pointless in my view as there is no real reward, tracker or anything that really incentivizes pvp over pve. Save for maybe a mind set :/.
---
Probably not. Everyone is doing the same quests and getting the same recipies. 
---
Maybe tick blood tequila... but I doubt you could charge all that much for it.
---
If you search this reddit there are several posts about that, especially at the time around the game's launch.
---
I hung around for about 45 mins. Twice. And why are they already dead?!
---
was just a plain sheepsqautch mask for me, the white one. LAME!!
---
Exactly, encouraging more social gaming
---
You get the camera today so that problem is fixed lol
---
I mean .. this is exclusively a "you" issue. As monitor stands change you will see even less and less of the lower resolution monitors being supported.
---
If you're really in a bind for cash just shop for a second hand 1080p monitor for now.
---
ok gamer tag is MetalLeopard567
---
That's most likely my camp! It's right across the street from the main gate of whitesprings
---
Hello u/LoneVaultWanderer \- can you please check it? Thanks ;)
---
5.56 ammo is more expensive to craft and the 50 cal fires way faster.
---
sorry, you sir are very wrong, this coming form a guy who grew up through punk
---
some bands were political, but hardly any were "socialist"
---
mostly it WAS just angsty testosterone fueled anarchy!
---
ITS PUNK FFS!
---
Or possibly to discourage "Oh, it's sellable, may as well loot it, sorry other people".
---
If you turn back and hug left, you will end up in a corner  that has the valve.
---
No. But here's another mascot head as a consolation.
---
The Enclave was mentioned in FO4 in the Institute I believe. It seems that it was just kind of in passing. Its been a while since I played NV, but I don't remember it, and if it was, it was probably in passing only. The eyebot was the only thing I remember of the enclave in NV. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I would love to see the Enclave as a massive faction to either be allied with or to be enemies. In what I am interpreting right now though they just seem to be in the DC wasteland.
---
agreed, the most punk they could get is the 50's style greasers and gangsters
---
I'd love to sell ammo too, but have just gotten into the habit of knowing my build really only shoots 5.56, 45 and 10mm. I have a hard time just passing everything else up, but really it does help
---
I drop them in the cash register in front of the bulk junk seller in the crafting room at Whitesprings. Level 30's need plans too, and at least someone will get them (I used to leave stuff in the Overseeer's cache in Flatwoods, but stopped when I realized the odds of it being found at all was terrible).
---
Just use a 1\* Bloodied 50 cal - Instigating on an auto weapon is not a great match.  The bloodied will easily out DPS your I25, although maybe see if you can reroll it when the legendary vendor comes out (so keep the I25, get a B 1\* for now).
---
You are not wrong.  It would be nice if the devs made that kill 10 golfers misc quest into a small interior at say, the tennis club (currently inaccessible) that was redesigned to just require us to kill all 10 enemies in the room.  20 caps, a little xp, and no more unicorn of a misc quest sitting unresolved in most people's list.
---
All the new challenges are mostly bs and a joke especially level up 3 times if you are high lvl (im 242) this challenge is rediculous. Early challenges kept me wanting to play this game and now not sure I will play as much as before
---
Will You be online later on
---
I don't understand what you're implying. Are you saying my goat head mascot mask isn't badass? Sir! How dare you!
---
Yeah, that's funny, but one of the things I just accept about the game. If we were to get more realism, I'd rather remove all legendary items, then make all characters essentially playing at 30% bloodied so that you kill fast but can also die fast like shooters. All damage increased to between 150-200% of current and then 100% health on the bar is 30% of current HP and any amount of radiation is bad and has negative effects, such as disorienting your character, making them sick, and increasing the chance of disease.
---
Side note: I love that people have actually downvoted your images on Imgur. I see the herd is still hating on the game.
---
Licensed games off comic books are rarely well done.
---
Great looking forward to it. Thanks for being so receptive and I look forward to playing with your group!
---
Had a fight last night and she just wouldn't land. Probably spent a total of 3 minutes on the ground the whole fight.

I can help get you started
---
THE STRANGER THERE AMONG THEM HAD A BIG IRON ON HIS HIP
---
It very rare for a player to destroy your camp or hit by a  nuke so I wouldn't put much thought to it
---
Well I mean a lot of the cosmetic skins in the Atom store are brand new for this game, I didn’t think it too far fetched that they could make the Ranger armour into a cosmetic skin, but fuck if I know!
---
I like it, but was really hoping all 6 eggs would hatch and I'd have to fight a mini deathclaw Easter army.
---
Use VATs target their stinger. Die in 1-2 hits. Plus they cannot poison you anymore.
---
Or have a limit of 25k and charge a fee
---
It shows up, just not often at all. I got mine on my 2nd trip in there, spent every cap I had on it. Have never seen it again.
---
We may have something like this with the Legendary Vendor.  This isn't a bad idea either, just don't think it is what Bethy wants us to do.
---
kill the  sheepsquatch  and cross you fingers ;)
---
not only that . demo expert is not aplying damage in the survival server for some reson.
---
Forgive me if I’m wrong but, I don’t think there is a plural for daily... so I can’t help you correct it. Carry on good fellow.
---
I am level 161 and a fair few hours of gameplay. Have tried farming the plans through server hopping but with no luck. Others have found them in a few hours of trying.
---
Pure luck.
---
Keep trying and good luck to you.
---
Same thing with x-01 calibrated shocks.
---
I grew up through punk, too.  My first show was at age 10 in 1986. We had a lot of political bands in our scene.  Songs about helping the local homeless population and free healthcare for all seem pretty socialist to me.  Socialism has a lot of negative connotations, especially these days, but I see nothing wrong with providing a helping hand to people that need it, even if my taxes are a little more expensive.
---
Yes but the Legendary Vendor sounds like more of the same.  Buy legendary items for caps or trade just like everyone already does on the marketplace.  It sounds like there is some mechanic for improving your legendary rolls but not sure what that is yet.
---
I have not had this method work for me since the last CAMP update.  Before I had a whole farm on my second level.
---
As far as we could decipher, The Two Shot's 25% damage boost is a bit better than Anti-armor if you have unmodded standard receivers (by \~4.9%). However, modded receiver doesn't seem to be considered by Two Shot so Anti-armor wins with Hardened receivers (by \~1.37%). Of course, there is the accuracy penalty and the need to hit the enemy with both bullets.
---
The versus legendary seems to be a starightforward boost so a Ghoul Slayer's Hardened Lever does 9.94% more effective damage against a Feral Ghoul than an Anti-armor Hardened Lever.
---
There is a [calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) that you can try with various settings.
---
I’ve got a B 50, but with my build, the I25 gat oneshots most normal mobs and 1-3 shots supermutants depending on if I have adrenaline rolling, if they’re a leader/legendary, and where I hit them. 
---
Listed damage on the I25 is ~273, which puts it at ~550 first hit. The Gatling gun may be auto, but it fires slow enough (and has subsequently high enough damage) that it’s basically semi-auto. And it’s crazy accurate. I can snipe with the damn thing. 
---
I do have a B Gatling gun too, I’m just sticking with the I25 because the 25% fire rate puts it at a perfect fire rate for the gun. 
---
Can’t wait for the legendary vendor though. I have sooooo many legendaries stashed away.
---
Omg I’m not the only one he thinks we should be able to holster them on our bags
---
It's a drop from the sheepsquatch boss fight, you can get a fedora, the mascot outfit pieces, or the sheepsquatch outfit pieces I believe
---
Oh please xD You've been getting paints since launch mate, we're now finally getting Excavator paints like half a year in almost..
---
Had that for most of the second dba fight today, seemed she was being staggered so stuck in mid air, we did win that one surprisingly
---
id wait on things like this until we see how the legendary vendor goes, or how grindy it is, or the mechanics of it in general
---
NCR ranger outfit... what glorious days....
---
I am pretty sure they said it would be a token system, turn in X gear and get Y tokens.  We just don't know what the tokens do.  Like can we add legendary effects, reroll some, reroll all, some other crazy stupid mechanic that Bethy makes up.
---
The RNG of those isn't fun either as I had expected to hop most of the night to get my 5 scorpions only to have scorpions in back to back server hops and be done in 10 minutes. The cave cricket experience more than made up for my good luck there though....
---
it's a mild upgrade over the camera challenges that we literally cannot do because they didn't release the camera.
---
Hmm. I haven't moved my base in months. That sucks if it was patched.  We need pots and garden tables!
---
Yeah, the guy is being a dick. But that's the point.
---
But let me ask this, if he hadn't, would you have a cool story to tell? Or would it have been just another game session of looting and questing?
---
15-20 lead is a drop in a bucket. I can guarantee that that's not why he was really there. He wants interactions with other players.

 Dispite how you look at it, you probably had a lot of fun because that guy showed up. You two came up with a plan of action you wouldn't have considered against mole rats.
---
Don't be mad at this guy, he is just role playing the bad guy. If he didn't say a word, claimed the workshop, one shot everyone with a his OP PvP build, then left with out building the workshop, then yeah, that's the true asshole.
---
I personally think Bethesda must own stock in Netflix because I watched two entire multi season series on Netflix while I mindlessly server hoped to get my X01 jet pack and calibrated shocks.
---
I'm really happy for all those trees and bushes in FO76, that are immune to nuclear strikes.
---
Now that's a DAMN GOOD BURGER right there!!!!
---
Unfortunately submitting a ticket won’t help your situation - all they’re going to tell you is they’re sorry and they’ve forwarded the info to the dev team but they can’t replace items lost. 
---
Lost a whole suit of power armor. :/ feels bad
---
Me and my crew are in our late 20s early 30s.
---
It's me , my significant other, her brother oh, and his wife. That's usually who I run with. But we've met plenty of people on the game that we consider friends who we only know through the game. And they seem to be maybe mid-thirties.
---
Sometimes we just mess around and do random stuff. We do nukes, events, build camps. Really just get together and decide what we want to do. We're all pretty chill and relax. Ain't no bossing around or anything like that

I think i read that I just can't remember what they said vs what was speculated.  We will soon see!
---
I was wearing a responder outfit, he said something about confirmation and entitled for aid or something. But nothing happened.
---
I could see it going either way for the BOS in FO4. I usually end up with the minute men faction. I like their jib and like locals taking care of locals rather than a military unit being in charge of citizens. I do believe the BOS is inherently good, but misguided with their pursuit of technology to hide it from other humans, then I look at the Institute and see why the BOS is the way they are. I like the idea of the BOS being a protector that keeps the raiders, mercs and super mutants at bay while the minutemen establish the ruins and be the police force for the commonwealth. The BOS in control would be more of a dictatorship or autocracy than a Republic that the USA was formed to be.
---
That's funny...but also sad. Mostly funny!
---
Is it limited time?
---
Ballistic Bock sadly does not work with .50 Cal =(. It does with Gatling gun... usually. IIRC High Voltage doesn't work with heavy energy weapons either.. or at least it didn't for me. It's kind of weird. I got Bock to work once on my alt, but I didn't have all 3 heavy weapons cards running. Once I put the last heavy weapons card on, it stopped working (buff says it's there, but no damage boost on character sheet). Haven't been able to replicate that though.
---
The other reason you might be dying suddenly is losing your well fed buff. This will literally kill you instantly if it drops when you use a radaway. 
---
Can't craft Psychotats. I don't think you could in Fallout 4 either, which I think was likely an oversight since it's just psycho + mentats, same as combining psychobuff, psychojet, bufftats, buffjet, etc. Here's hoping. For now I buy them at 10-20c a pop and only use on queen.
---
The Watoga school, look in the round containers. I will fine at least 1 each time I go there to a point that I drop them in whitesprings for other people to use since im waiting till they make them stack for the quest.
---
Isnt this basically like asking "Why doesnt this game run on windows vista?"
---
Fallout runs on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. Need help getting Fallout to run? Please check the [sidebar / drop down menu fix guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutMods/wiki/fixguide) for a list of fixes that will get the game running.
---
It happens with Biv's speakeasy, too.  You just need to jump to a new server to fix the bug.
---
There isn’t a time. It is 20 hours from your first transaction with them.
---
It should be every 20 hours from when you last sold them something
---
20 hours after you sell something.  I don't know if buying something when they are at max starts the timer.
---
It refreshes ever 20 hours
---
I have a... either bloody or vampire 25% fire LMG. Before the last patch when they reworked heavy weapons (and lowered its fire rate) literally just tapping the fire button would shoot off like 7 bullets.
---
It should stay at 4 person teams (thats crucial for any resemblance of balance, changing this would be a pivot from current design), but then it should allow you marking other teams as friendly. I.e. the leader of team 1 may approach the leader of team 2 and invite whole their team to a "gang" just the way you normally invite players.
---
Wait, wait, wait... Where are these backpacks?! When did they get introduced?
---
Oh ok thanks that an interesting mechanic
---

Yes, this happened to me yesterday. Got some sick weapons. Level 50 Furious Mr. buzz saw &amp; a level 50 Anti armour, Explosive Railway rifle. They just kept on respawning for 30 min. Also, there where som bugs where a glowing one kept walking up to the sky after I killed it. Like a ghoul angel. I had to jump up high to get my legendary shit. It did this serveral times
---
BE 50cal and B25 Gatling gun. I haven’t even thought about 3rd stars yet.
---
This has been suggested 100 times, we all agree it should be added, there is no point in reposting it again and again.
---
i went in game to prove my point and only proved half of it, it is indeed 4X but you do require the torso to be on in order to benefit from the bonus mining. so in a way we are only half correct.

Nope! The plot line for the fight was placed in the Wild Appalachia add-on :)
---
Yes please! Cmon Beth weve all been waiting!
---
GAH, wrong reddit. Human error. Apologies :)
---
Not really, they had him outnumbered 2-1, the lead is a little bargaining chip and quite frankly 15 lead is nothing.  
---
Again, he could have very easily claimed the workshop mid conversation and just killed them repeatedly, but he decided to try and talk and play the part of a raider.  
---
Like everyone else likes to point out too, taking workshops opebs you up tonthe possibility of other people contesting them, he verbally contested this workshop and even offered something instead, what i get is randonly killed while im trading because someone "contested" my workshop agross the map and their team mate killed me and my crew in a shot kills
---
I'm waiting for the travel sticker Pip-Boy. Hopefully I haven't missed it.
---
PS4? If you need help with anything, hit me up, PSN dangerousdylan94. We've got a growing community of people dedicated to helping others in the Wasteland
---
They are rare, but not as rare as calibrated shocks. I’ve seen up to 8 XO1 jet packs before seeing even one calibrated shock.
---
Imposter outfits man they sell like hot cakes
---
3rd person shooting is also a LOT less accurate than aiming in 1st person.  It's just part of the charm, I guess.
---
I have and it is beginning to become a pain. As I have renamed them I can  now tell which one is which, which helps with organisation.
---
Lol...2 characters @232 and 208, it's not that there is nothing to do, it sounds like you just don't know who to play the game.
---
They’ll probably have it in the atom shop honestly don’t beat yourself up over it or run the event next year
---
Missed opportunity to put in the intro from the announcement trailer.
---
THIS JUST HAPPENED TO ME!
---
I simply server hopped and then my PA was gone from my inventory
---
It was there one moment, gone the next
---
I didnt scrap any weapons/armor before that, didnt sell anything
---
i honestly wasnt sure i believed all these report of disappearing stuff, but now its happened to me, damn, its real shit
---
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
---
It was really hassle to complete it.... and all those broken Camera Challenges double up the annoyance
---
There are chameleon deathclaws in FO76. I only know of one spawn, but there’s a chance it wasn’t a bug, but a feature. A vicious, invisible feature.
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
Why would I make any effort when you are just outright lying?
---
That made me laugh 😂
---
Here is a quick explanation on how it works, and someone confirmed below that it does still work.
---
https://youtu.be/sahlOICt5e0?t=191
---
There's a hidden quest at Toxic Larry's meat n go by Berkeley that was introduced at the same time. Doesn't give you another mounted head though just a mystery meat pie
---
Agua Fria (translates to cold water).
---
Admittedly, I reached the cap limit back when the Civil War Top Hat was a thing.  If their numbers are any indication, I suppose the Marine Tactical Helmet is the new version of that.  But now that all vendors feed off the same cap pool, it's marginally easier to drain their bank accounts everyday without having to hop to a handful of different places, trying to clear as close to 200 on each.  Just clear out the enemies around them, sell their guns, and you're halfway there.
---
As for cheaper plans on the Internet, a lot of duped crap still floats around, which is how they manage to offer it at a 1/3 of the normal price.  Even when the SBQ dropped serum recipes, I sure as heck never got one and I've run her more times than I can count.
---
The slaughter of innocent baby death Claws? :(
---
This is a pain for me as I have my camp in whitesprings. Luckily I am near the decontamination area which helps a lot, but it is a pain in general if I have favourable mutations such as marsupial.
---
No this was a bug I run into it every now and then. Basically the enemy is under the ground but able to hit you. I know because the name kept poping up as scorched Deathclaw lol had it happen with a level 24 assaltron as well once its face beam was shooting straight out of the ground from under me
---
Good bot?
---
This happened to me once, I was walking up to a stray cat that looked so cutee and it exploded. Still haunts me to this day...
---
We'll aways have our goo.
---
I saw a SB at the Summerville end of the lake bed where new gad is yesterday, there’s a random spawn on the road there so I didn’t know if it was a new random spawn event for that area, usually it’s a couple of robots, dead Brahmin, manaquins etc. It kept flying in a circle so as there was a nice pink sky i took advantage of it being there and took a photo lol
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/q6EKuF9
---
Didn't know about the well fed bonus either, and it sounds like there's a cap on damage boosts you hit when you add on alcohol.  Since I don't have Nerd Rage, I might not hit that cap?
---
Nom
---
Just add raid groups. Think of how WoW handled this. You still had your normal 5 man teams, but they could be formed into either a 10 person (2x5) or 25 person (5x5) raid group. Even if we simply had the flexibility of say an 8 or 12 person raid, we could slap together 2 or three parties and move on with our business. 
---
With this change though would need to come some enhancements to enemy scaling. It would need to consistently scale up both the level and quantity of enemies spawned in areas and events where a raid group was involved.
---
The settlement budget wouldn't be the same budget...
---
Yea it was hard to make sure to grab them all, should have been a grace period after the sixth to collect any you were missing
---
You see how quickly they can remove something useful yet drill and syringer are still in there when they promised to remove them long ago. Of course it's all intentional, a company can't have this many 'accidents' and stay in business.
---
Problem with the big iron being that a Walker Colt would explode like a hand grenade if you weren't careful.  People weren't worried about being shot, they were worried about getting hit by shrapnel
---
You can count on me to be there with you
---
I launched a lot of nukes and the difficulty didn't change. 
---
On a fresh server instance, you get the usual low level gutsies and assaultrons in the beginning, maxing out with 46-54 robots in the launch room. 
---
If you go back to the same silos after 3 hours, the turrets remain destroyed if you destroyed them before, but the silo will be full with level 46-54 robots in every section (and the sentrybot will be lvl 60).
---
Bring a Troubleshooter's weapon and do as much sneak attack as possible. I'm using a Troubleshooter's Handmade with Tormentor 3 and try to shoot the legs of the Assaultrons or the arms of the Gutsies first. The Protectrons/Robobrains can be shot in the chest with not much hassle.
---
oooh, Perfect. Thank you.
---
I noticed this, logging out at the clubhouse and logging back in didn't respawn enemies. What I did find that worked was logging out at the whitesprings station, logging back in there then walking round. I'm not 100% sure on this but I think they stopped repawns on log ins, but that is just going off the experiences I have had.
---
Same man, I love wearing it with the tux!!
---
Nah, there's no ass to chap.
---
Some problems with this (in my opinion) people can just exploit the stash box limit and send it to a alt account and that they don't have to worry about reaching the stash limit so i think it would be great if there was a cooldown
---
T**here** is a location that's very far away.
---
They**'re** something, but not sure what they are.

This is good thinking! Not something you'd typically think about.
---
Would be nice if you could fully repair your campsite items with it maybe. Though that might become tedious, if you had to do it for each piece.
---
I could be wrong but I believe that particular item is sold by the roaming Charleston vendor...
---
Il take you up on this. Im not on as much as i want right now but thanks man
---
Corny
---
I don’t think you have.  I check almost daily and don’t recall seeing it.
---
I would recommend just buying one off /r/market76 to save your sanity.  Mine only cost me like 2.5K and that was well worth it instead of hunting for hours.
---
Yes, all the time.  I used to have a CAMP on the edge of the Ash Heap right next to the Charleston Fire Department, and had to move it after being harassed by random scorchbeasts way more often than I should, considering there wasn't a fissure anywhere near.  Nowadays, my CAMP is right across the tracks from the Whitespring Station.  There's a fissure somewhat nearby and I've only had a scorchbeast attack my camp twice after having it there for a couple months.
---
Here's a [pic of some of the insanity that would happen at my first CAMP near the Ash Heap](https://imgur.com/TfHN75H).  Completely crazy for a low level area.
---
The trick to get a new server is to wait about 30 seconds to a minute before trying to rejoin. It is how I farm plastic, clean out morgantown high school and whitesprings little putting area with like 30+ golf balls on it.
---
So a normal hop for me would be clean out those two spots, log out to main menu, open up the atomic shop wait 30 seconds close the atomic shop and then rejoin a server. I can't remember the last time I ended up back on the same server I was on.
---
Broadsider should have a giant (like comically big) powder keg strapped to your back.
---
Same as above, pretty loose, but we do end game content when the right people are on and motivated, but otherwise we find stuff to do in smaller groups. 
---
PSN = MyTurkishPrison
---
I feel you.
---
I haven't had anyone attack my camp ever - until last night.  After months, I decided to move to an area that's still off the beaten path, but not quite as out of the way as my previous location.  I was rebuilding the camp and someone comes along before I'm even finished and starts shooting at all my stuff with an explosive weapon.  Sigh.  Dick.  I just server hopped and blocked him.
---
Haha damn.. that’s kind of playing russian roulette without pointing the goddamn thing into your face.
---
I really like it it was a cool and fun little thing you got to do and not only did you get some killer death claw eggs but a free mascot head tbh I was suppppppper happy cause my whole thing was the suicide rabbit and now I get to wear a rabbit head
---
It happens from time to time.  Yes, it sucks.  It's also pretty damn unacceptable six months after release.
---
That said, I've also seen her come flying all the way back, so it doesn't hurt to wait a minute or two.
---
Yeah, it is exploiting a mechanic. I can guarantee that the "team" mechanic was never designed as a "haha, lets get players to team up so they can have their friends kill teammates for loot'
---
Literally my picture 😂 tse handmade w 3 perks and my perksetup= mass destruction, while looking fly 😎
---
I would love this. Main reason i cant wait for private servers and modding. I played fallout 4 with a tweaked survival mode. I made enemies deal 10x and player deal 10x damage. Made it so emmersive and rewarding to play. When private servers come out im definately tweaking the damage modifiers.
---
The bag usually stays for a while, but it won't load the contents of it after you leave the server.
---
I encountered it about 4-5 times when i was grinding a random encounter spot for grahm or the responder vendorbot. I had a fire breathers outfit so i put it on and it said something about giving me coordinates, but nothing happened. I'm assuming if you encounter it earlier in the game with a responder outfit on it'll give you an unmarked location.
---
I just want a Clean variant of my Drifter outfit and Newsboy cap. That's all. Please, Bethesda. I love my look, the only thing I need is to sew up the rips and tears.
---
If it makes you feel better, it's not lag or ping, happens to me all the time and I have good internet.
---
It's be nice to sell plans for easy to find stuff like Basketball Hoops to vendors. I enjoy giving those to new players but they'll have the same problem even sooner.
---
I knew you still cared!
---
You can use those boss fights to complete weekly challenges such as 'collect 76 drills from three star legendary enemies in a nuked area'.
---
Yeah, the civil war suit is great, but doesn't work for this. It's gotta be a plain ol' clock-puncher suit.
---
I'm not sure how to look another sub, but check out r/PKOA . There's a bunch of us that are all looking to help out
---
People just love to dream big I guess! Their ideas were cool I suppose but they should have expected something a lil more simple, it is Bethesda
---
Isn't the Leather cap already pretty cop like?
---
There's a door at the taxidermy?????? Omg
---
Any changes that make people server hop less would be welcomed in my book.
---
I tried to find one since beta and had no luck, then about about 3 weeks ago found 2 in 2 days.
---
Check your armors bench, it secretly unlocks in there
---
Thank you for suggesting this. I have wanted a mailbox since day one :)
---
How much would you want for it, and are you on PC like I am?
---
Handmade has slightly lower base damage, lower fire rate, and much smaller magazine size after the heavy weapons buff. I'm going to be honest - the .50 Cal didn't really need the buffs that it got. The Handmade is nice in that you have more flexibility in the Strength tree, and of course a VATS build is possible. It also has an armor piercing magazine, however, if you use that you're going to be dealing with a 20 round mag. Lot of reloading. That might not matter so much for normal use, but for the queen it's a pain. I haven't tried a full on sneak / crit vats  build, but I've heard that getting off sneak attacks during the queen fight is a real nuissance, and you're probably far better off just shoving a .50 cal down her throat and holding down the trigger, which is what I do.
---
Some of those pistols with long barrels and suppressors would be pretty close to dragging the ground if holstered at the hip.
---
We should be able to reroll plans for a plan we don't have.
---
Partly it's because, thanks to datamining, we know what's coming, so it's a question of whether or not this is the week when we can get it.
---
My character has always had a kind of football aesthetic, so naturally the outfit and the helmet would be nice to have.  I can't remember if there were any CAMP things I was looking forward to.
---
No. Just until you log off or maybe a little after.
---
I haven't even seen a deathclaw on Deathclaw Island lol.
---
Since perk sharing is a thing... we won’t ever see more than 4.
---
There’s the right attitude! They’ll most likely post it on the shop in the coming months or do it next event, there will definitely be other chances!
---
I do think that Arthur is more facist etc. but as Danse says he’s locked under protocol, and in my opinion he is way to strict/engrossed/power addicted. But then again he reformed the outcasts which are probably one of my favourite factions except the NCR.
---

---
Would keep an eye on this\~
---
Absolutely, that's why I posted. The past month or so, it's been very rare to get a random group from the server to cooperate or even show up to a fight and have success with one queen, let alone two.  I think we were very lucky with our server pool too. We had 3 successful SBQ fights this past weekend and I feel the crew I'm part of is awesome, but all the random players who showed up were just as awesome in their own right as well and everyone was working pretty much together and knew what they should be doing.  I was posting a completely different story just a couple of weeks ago.
---
I just want to see how long you'll keep trying to get the last word in.
---
That's probably it - the heavy barrel mod. The math in this game is also just weird - some multipliers re additive, some are multiplicative. I'm still looking for my BE / B25 50 cal as well sadly. Just so damn rare. If I could get both in a single trade I might trade my BE + VATS harpoon gun.
---
There is a note next to the terminal.  It describes all his cats.  His favorite is the one he TRUSTS.  That cat's name (for me) was Mari (MA RI).  On the terminal, it lists the birthdays of all the cats.  Mari's birthday is 11/17 (for me), so the passcode was MA RI 11 17
---
The point is to inform Bethesda of how important and annoying this is to their players.
---
At level 200, if you planned your build and never moved any points, you could have over 300 cards to sort through even after combining many of them.
---
https://youtu.be/gsC4kf6x_Q0
---
Yes pls
---
It’s free and a small add on to either enjoy or not, not game breaking and one of many new things they are adding just to spice it up.... oh and it’s free
---
I don't think it's necessarily not "letting her land."  After crippling the wings, I think her AI has issues finding valid places to land from time to time - the same thing happens with normal Scorchbeasts.  They know they are supposed to, but they also have to get into a valid position to do it.
---
When she does land, there are times when she'll just stand there and get whacked in the face for a good two minutes, doing absolutely nothing to fight back.  Then, out of nowhere, she might begin attacking again or immediately fly upward.
---
I'm just hoping for at least single * legendary power armor. Then probably a cav set for my unarmed power armor build.
---
Guess we will see. My vote is there will probably be more salty people than happy people as a result of today's update.
---
Camera should be added in as well as mods being fixed.
---
Lol I drop 38 and 44 ammo and give the plans away I'd like to sell them but I'm hording legendary weapons and armor!
---
That gold revolver needed to be all revolvers
---
totally agree, I can screenshot on PS4 and we already have a camera mode, and let's be honest, no one really cares to look at other people's photos...
---
I bought one at launch and il be keeping it as part of my fallout collection but tbh so much has changed in the game that the guide was soon obsolete and they’ve probably been collecting dust and taking up stock room space that they need. They normally come with an online code for the online version with the interactive map which is really handy when you want to discover absolutely every location in the game, just bear in mind that if the location is listed as having a bobblehead, magazine or cap stash it may no longer be the case. Lovely guide though
---
I could sort of see this but as dlc, late game dlc too
---
No problem!
---
Well, of course it isn't... the camera is offset, you're never directly behind the barrel?
---
Am I missing something here?
---
Yeah, I have one I've been saving for my next Whitesprings Nuke Experience, might start bringing it out of habit.
---
Some guy did a study.  Drop rate is 1% chance per visit.
---
You’re like the guy complaining about Easter content. It’s supposed to be fun. The team working on additional content is most likely not the same as the team on the camera or the team doing the atom shop. 
---
It’s ok if it’s not what you wanted... some people do.
---
Camera will be added and modding should be fixed! 
---
Patch notes should be in here once they start the maintenance : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bg6adi/fallout\_76\_maintenance\_april\_23\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bg6adi/fallout_76_maintenance_april_23_2019/)
---
Mods should be at the top of fixes
---
I believe they're sneaking them in with each update. There's been increasing sheepsquatch related random encounters too.
---
Have you tried over-repairing it to 200% condition.
---
Yeah, energy weapons are totally screwed. They cant participate in the TSE meta, they get no benefit from Tank Killer or Stabilized. They can roll anti armor which is mostly useless for them, and yet they get nothing to compensate for the smaller legendary modifier pool and clutch perk cards that make other weapons viable.
---
I understand and agree 100%, but flooding the sub with the same requests over and over and over achieves nothing.
---
They aren't making it intentionally encourage server hopping. They are just making bad decisions to try to slow down how many atoms people are earning doing the challenges. So they try to make them as specific and hard to find as possible so they are nearly impossible, OR in the case of the camera challenges this week actually impossible since the camera isn't even in the game.
---
That’s an awesome addition to your name!!!
---
SBs seem to be ranging much further from the fissure sites since the last update, not sure if this was intentional or not, but I have seen several around the Overseers Camp and Flatwoods in the past few days.
---
\*mind boggled\*
---
Ammosmith and Super Duper as well? Because honestly, once I got the acid thing worked out, I tend to live the better part of a week between lead runs. And that's with a minigun/gatling gun play style.
---
Bethesda can just ad in a basic on the back holster for rifles and side for 10 mm guns that only doesnt clip with any lether type of armor, and slowly release better holsters that dont clip for atoms i believe this is the best way to do this not that much work for Bethesda it could be like a small side project to get peoples attention
---
There is! It's called Vault Boys WV: A Fallout 76 Podcast. I've listened to a lot of the episodes, it's a good listen while I'm doing random things in the game.
---
Thankfully one of their reps said it would be fixed today!
---
I’ve never seen a “triple A” company botch something this bad. Even the cash grab P2W RNG nightmare loot box games from EA are at least polished and playable.
---
No where at the moment. The quest line is scheduled for May 7.
---
I found the best place to farm the vendor bot is actually the location near Lady Janet's soft serve which is above Vault 76 - it's a easier spot to farm as no one builds their camp there because it's on a downhill road so you're not losing attempts to find the bot to someone's camp. When you spawn in - you want to run by Janet's - killing any enemies - then down the road past the overturned bus is the spawn point! 
---
I hope you find that vendor bot and get your coat! I would give you one of mine but I'm on the Xbox!
---
I'm sure it's not, but I'm looking forward to it. I don't use the current camera mode, but I intend to use the new camera to take photos of interesting things I see, for reminders of places I want to come back to,  
---
and place I might want to move my camp to and/or take pictures of other peoples' camps. It's a very small addition, but I'm not even close to any type of endgame so I'm not bored with nothing to do (however, I realize that is a real problem for many).
---
On PC, could do it with my wife's account, but server hopping seems to work just as well for me. Just had a string of bad luck, it seems.
---
I used to have one and when I was standing next to a wall and shooting the wall to test this I took rad damage
---
Base damage on an auto is already lower, and when factored against the significant increase in ammo used, it is already pretty well balanced. The folks that use an auto and spam crits to wreck people in PVP are doing so at the expense of their free time, as they are going to be spending hours per week simply gathering materials for ammunition.

Personally, I still switch between auto and semi auto depending on what Im doing, because the drain on resources is so much less with a semi. On a busy night of killing a queen and some runs at the imposter SS, I might use a total of 1500 rounds on semi auto, while I could easily end up dumping between 5000 rounds of ammo between my autos. Sure, my damage output it definitely higher on auto, but so is the amount of time I am going to need to spend essentially not playing the game to recoup my resources lost. 
---
It is balanced, just not in the way you are talking about. The mechanic in the game most in need or rebalancing is the low health build. The synergy between bloodied weapons, unyielding armor, nerd rage, adrenal reaction and serendipity does not exist for any other build. So if we were calling for even a modest leveling of the playing field, it would need to first involve a build with so many layers of congruence. With that said, I would be in favor of ADDING some synergy to a few other build types as opposed to nerfing anything.
---
Or dmg any player dore to lower lock picking lvl
---
What do you feel is fair for it?
---
The last word in what? I thought we were really having a heart to heart conversation here.
---
Dang, thanks dude
---
Right!
---
I don't think we have enough data from different characters to conclude on this yet. 
---
My Riflewoman build with Luck 10, Charisma 3 encounters 3\* legendary enemies [26.6% of the time](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=717308889) since Patch 8. My previous character with Luck 4, Charisma 4 encountered 3\* legendaries [11.7% of the time](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz0Hej1N5UOeXGvXKiq6h9N-utjWjhiFdqXLvfDwu8/edit#gid=717308889) between Patches 5-6.
---
I think the chance for a 3\* to drop a 3\* is not affected by your luck or what server you are on, but is a game preset (it noticeably dropped from \~40% pre patch 8 down to \~21% post patch 8).
---
I'll give it a shot tonight. Currently I get about 1,000 steel per 10-12 minute run by clearing west tek + General's Steakhouse + Harper's Ferry, though I have to server hop a few times to find a Harper's Ferry that is spawning purely mutants, but once it's found, I stay with that server. I had to add the 3rd location last night because I was running into server respawn limits when only doing west tek and harpers ferry. 
---
Although... one downside - no fast travel in the nuke zone. That's going to be a pain. That's part of the reason West Tek + Harpers + Steakhhouse is so good - clear each out in a few minutes and can fast travel between.
---
No problem! I know the struggle of finding the bot so I always wanna help anyone searching for it.
---
Becouse i play since beta 4+ hours a day got 2 characters. Never lost single item from inventory. But i sold so much items i didnt want and if you spam drop items like spoiled meat you can drop alot of unwanted items. Its not your fault that they got laggy database but i dont think its possible for your items to just vanish, its the same shit like the fake trade glitch. But maybe im just lucky
---
I know we can't create actually programmed quests but we can make quests for ourselves.
---
Only if it turns out that we can make wall decor of the photos we take
---
Specifically it's the quest looking for the missing hunters.
---
Thanks, that s really helpful.
---
"Somebody once told me, the world was gonna roll me..."
---
If the Mojave taught me anything it's that those bastard are far from innocent.
---
Yeah same here...but havent since that energy weapon explos patch...still wondering myself.
---
The mothman lore is pretty well known, but if you aren’t familiar with it there are a couple documentaries on Amazon Prime. As well as one about the Flatwoods Monster (this one was way more interesting than I expected). You can also read about the Grafton monster and Sheepsquatch on various cryptid sites. 
---
One thing I absolutely appreciate is the attention to local cryptid lore, and while kinda poking fun of it, also treating it with respect. 
---
I’m not from WV, but I am close, and I can tell you that the game really looks like the area (the non-ruined parts anyway). 
---
I also really appreciated the attention to detail at night, when the peep frogs start singing (most pronounced in the Mire, which is fitting). My parents live across from a creek and these frogs go nuts at night. 
---
Granted that’s not specific to this area, those frogs are all over the east coast. But it was a nice touch. 
---
The recent Fasnacht festivities in Helvetia are absolutely based on reality and in fact, if you participated in that event in-game you would recognize things IRL there. Check YouTube for Fasnacht for more, and be amazed.
---
Even more impressive is the Whitespring, based on the Greenbrier. There was a post here recently where a player visited the Greenbrier and was giving people directions because he was so familiar with the layout. 
---
You mention layout and no, the map in game is not very accurately laid out. I guess they wanted to spread out cities so that things aren’t clustered.
---
Yup, they don't even realize that their actions are actually hurting the atom shop. I'm what most would consider a "whale" in games that have shops like this. I've dropped well over 400$ in the shop on PoE, and probably a few thousand on LoL. I haven't spent a penny in the atom shop, and I sure as hell won't in the future when they try to pull this crap.
---
I have NEVER seen a company put up weekly challenges in the game that are literally impossible due to the item not being in the game (camera). It is utterly pathetic and just pushing me further and further into the "never spending a penny in this obvious cash grab with zero respect for the customers". 
---
So as long as they want to treat their players with zero respect, then I will make sure they don't make a penny from me or any of my friends.
---
That could be it, but yeah none of the alcohols work for me on heavy weapons. Should also be noted that I just got an achievement for killing enemies with pistols... while using the gatling gun.
---
A cap cost per item send maybe
---
I live out that way and every now and again a non aggro flies by, also seen one fly by the giant teapot.
---
Never had them go aggro though so that is strange.
---
Hey, don't knock it.  All of that irradiated meat and decades-old junk food probably does a number on your teeth.  Legendary Toothpaste is worth whatever people are charging for it.
---
What were the effects?
---
Hahahahaha man, I remember my first run in with those deathclaws and their babies in the Mojave, that was hell 😂
---
Hmm unknown then
---
Click on the level up challenge. It will give you a drop down list. All 3 level ups should be achievable in one, granted you have the listed requirements (i.e. over level76, wearing a clown costume, diseased). I found that getting the well rested bonus also helps with levelling up faster. Hope that helps:)
---
Not every update can be some huge event or dungeon, small things in between are fun too.
---
Personally not that interested in the camera, will just have one around for the challenges.
---
Yeah. I think it's pretty cool still. At least they didnt say it was made out of canvas...
---
I posted the video of how to get the mounted wendigo plan from the southern belle motel.
---
As of right now there are no other mounts in the game but hopefully today's DLC patch will unlock a few more missions to get more mounts.
---
as soon as I find them I will make a video to let everyone know if you happen to find one before I make a video let me know so I can let everyone else know
---
I bought one there last week.
---
Cloudy with a chance of Cramballs
---
I have no context, as I rarely trade. Assuming it's a 1 star AA, I'd offer 500 caps and/or a trade if I can find something you're looking for in my stock. Above 1 star, it would depend on the other effects. I would probably not offer more than 2k for any given weapon, mostly because if the weapon is good enough to be worth more I couldn't reasonably match the price.
---
I like the sound of it... but Bethesda loves the RNG. Would have to have random legendary attributes added otherwise everyone would be a god also.
---
All cosmetics in atom store are reskins (as far as i know/remember) for existing armors and gear (mainly from fo4 with some exceptions like wood armor, excavator PA) while ranger armor would require all new armor set to make it look the way it is supposed to look.
---
Not to mention the base resolution on the model is FAR higher than a FO4 render.
---
Leave it on the dead body down the hill. Everyone checks dead bodies, and not everyone knows about paper bags if they're totally fresh to FO76
---
You see how much Bethesda cares about Fallout 76. They didnt bother to fix the issues they copied over from Fallout 4.
---
I think the new camera mode is supposed to be MUCH quicker and LESS encumbersome than the current method. You will basically equip it like a weapon and take your shots with the trigger. Not sure how they will incorporate the fancy frames and filters etc. but if it makes taking pictures easier, then it is only a plus.
---
if it’s referring to the bugs with armor mods then it’s rightful salt for Bethesda sitting on their ass for a week instead of fixing serious issues.
---
I want my Warhawk .\_.
---
It's rare. I finally got mine after a few days of server hopping multiple times.
---
But why would you expect this with the current systems in place? People would just go and kill it, and the whining would be very real then 🤔
---
Congrats! I can't stop finding sentinel and cavalier pieces since survival servers went live. I get a few pieces a week now which is pretty crazy!
---
Was it + 30% damage to plaque, whitening, and +1 to Charisma?
---
500 sounds good, IGN is Roarbee, I'll hop on now :)
---
Yea that’s what I was saying, plus it’s too complicated, they already have a huge roadmap with content that they’re still pushing back to make sure it comes out great, they’re buried in work, no way would they do an in-game event trigger like that, with all the stuff being released shortly after that in today’s patch
---
Also hopping on, IGN MrBright01
---
Pokemon snap was a thing, the camera idea has already been incorporated into the game so at least making it a tangible thing and making the process of taking pictures more functional and rewarding, I don't see the harm. 
---
Will I use it? Probably not beyond whatever easy free atoms I can get during launch.... But I know lots of people take and post images of their game world hijinks so I don't have any issues with the content tbh.
---
Maybe like 500
---
Will the reroll tokens be trade-able?
---
I'mma go out on a limb and ask, in a world where we are terrorized by a giant fucking bat monster and most of the towns are run by egotistical AI, what exactly is normal?
---
LMAOOO TOO SOON, THAT STILL TRIGGERS ME
---
Hmm it was the one from Fallout 3 DLC but I honestly don't think so or they changed the look of it in this game from Fallout 3. But I believe your right its Gauss Rifle.
---
To be fair to Bethesda it just one of many things coming on the roadmap and photomode has been really popular. Personally I will be taking more pics with a camera than photomode as I can quick select from my fav wheel and position far more easily than the current method so I welcome this addition 📷
---
Will be no-mic, cause wife is still asleep and if I wake her up for a digital item trade she'll be cranky all day xD. I can hear, just not speak.
---
&gt;The only valid reason they're acting naive to the issue is because if we're earning less we'll have to buy more.
---
Well it is having the exact opposite effect and they don't even realize it. I'm what they would consider a "whale" I don't mind throwing cash at a game I enjoy and the developers treat their players with respect. I've spent thousands in LoL on skins, and hundreds on PoE for skins. This game though? I've not spent a penny and as long as they continue to show zero respect towards the player base they will not ever get a penny from me, or my friends who also spend lots of money on skins in games they enjoy.
---
They are literally pushing away the exact people they should be trying to cater to, or at least NOT alienate. They act like those of us who use these shops are stupid and will fall for these obvious money grabs, yeah no that isn't going to get the reaction they want.
---
Id really like to know before I buy one lol...tossed my old one like an idiot
---
ah!!!! ok thank you so much!!!  i was thoroughly confused before :)
---
I have found 5 so far. I buy them every time to help out others who have been less lucky. Most recent was a few days ago.
---
Same, I sold it for 3k caps before it became popular
---
I've heard they add cement to many foods in some countries. Those who follow the news know which countries.
---
It tells you that in the quest you do to unlock it 🤦‍♂️
---
Depends on time of day maybe, IDK. The other thing I've noticed is if you get a West Tek that spawns lots of legendaries, it tends to spawn legendaries consistently, every clear. Maybe just really weird RNG, but it seems like that happens in Whitesprings too - you nuke a whitesprings with lots of legendary ghouls, you get lots of legendary ghouls when clearing it over and over. If you nuke one with none, the drops absolutely suck. So if you find one that has 2-3 3 star legendaries... maybe consider doing the reclear method by using the 2nd account. 
---
Don't know if you've never tried clearing Whitesprings over and over with your wife's account parked to hold the server, but... I highly recommend it. Once the randoms give up and you have the respawns on lockdown, you can do a 10-12 minute route that gets every ghoul in Whitesprings. I set my alts camp up beside the train station, just out of nuke range, so I have a place to scrap / repair / sleep if I want the exp buff. Though at level 350... I don't really need exp anymore lol.
---
its all of us, im on ps4 and its ridiculous how long it takes after you load in
---
The chainsaw would like to have a word with you Mr. Drill.
---
I vouch for this along with MORE HAIRSTYLES, please!!! I have curly hair IRL!!! Or even a ponytail idk t\_\_t
---
Nah, have you ever held a note book full of prototype drawings and writings? Them things are heavy, we aren't talking about a Holo tapes plan here these look like note books.
---
The bag will stay even after you leave the server for a random period of time, eventually becoming inaccessible, but I have seen them still accessible 2-3 hours later.
---
Placing items in world containers they will remain until the containers normal contents re-spawn, at which time they will disappear, and this can vary based on whether or not the container contents are Instanced or Static. (Instanced= each player sees different items, Static= everyone sees the same items).
---
It's hard to kill someone 5 times your level even with 2 people. I'm level 100 and my weapons to almost 5 times what a normal level 20 does. Not including tmthey have almost 2-3 time more hp than them not including if they have good armor with high damage resistance. Now if a he was level 100 and they were both 50 then it would be fair. He still out-levels them by 70.
---
I'm on PC. Yesterday I've had 7 disconnects in 2 hours. That's one disconnect every 17 minutes...
---
Why would cave crickets in tangla town count towards the "kill cave crickets in UNCANNY CAVERN"?
---
Prefer to ask on here as people have better farms than the links that are on google
---
I like my magic pockets :(
---
Great example of this subreddit beginning to create expectations that aren't happening and haven't been indicated to be happening. 
---
It's not happening.
---
I've accidentally dropped weapons and didn't even realize it. The "R" is right next to the "E" and in the heat of the moment sh\*t happens. One time I was in the middle of a fight/scrounge session and saw a bag sitting there... "Hmm that's funny some poor slob died here" I'm thinking. Look in the bag and it's my max level Bloodied Hardened Handmade! :o
---
Heres $5 worth of microtransactions to make you feel better. (I love fallout dont hate me)
---
You are, I’m gonna post a picture latter.
---
The barrel is pointing to the ground instead of the center of the screen (reticle).
---
Last step get the hell out of there when the nuke drops
---
Theres at least 1 missing
---
Yeah, I was never a fan of that one either for the same reason.  And you bring up a good point - it's fine for things you find in the wasteland to be janky, but if you're crafting this yourself, it's kind of weird (same as the shattered windows in your CAMP).  Especially when it's a new asset - you can't explain it as them just recycling something from a previous game.  They built it this way intentionally while the Fasnacht masks were perfectly intact.
---
Maybe they just wanted it to look creepy.
---
F U C K the chainsaw... It ain't got shit on Daddy Drill! That lumber chopping POS ain't gonna help you fix your shelf! But daddy drill can!
---
Where do I find these people? I just run into people 10x my level and thirst me so I immediately run from any PC lol
---
Especially useful if you partake of the Cannibal perk. :D
---
Craft via armour workbench.
---
Gognak the barbarian is a holotape game in fo76!
---
Man I was so heated when they did that I was just like wtf am I gonna buy with 5 bucks -.-, it’s all love though, they’re humans and make mistakes!
---
Mr handy would like a word.
---
I logged in my camp with it I had it when I logged off tho. That's the problem.
---
They dgaf, and won’t fix challenges,period. it’s their petty way of trying to get you to buy atoms.
---
&gt;And it is how I completed it.
---
Really? You killed cave crickets in tangla town and they counted towards the "Kill cave crickets in UNCANNY CAVERNS"? 
---
Why do I have a feeling you are full of shit?
---
Please, make this happen Beth'y :)
---
Lets be realistic. Bethesda servers won't handle that many players.
---
NO problem!! Hope you love your new mascot head!! :)
---
Its been a week since the burrows (which was really bad) launched, some players want some new endgame content, and a camera that you take pictures with is the exact opposite of endgame content, sure it may have a small quest, but is this really the best they could do?
---
I've also had very good luck at Ranger District Office.  Got three data there multiple times, and almost always get at least one.
---
Still crying eh?
---
Real reason for that weight is to make players dump them if they have no plan on using it, every unique item you have on you drags down server so if I have 50 different kinds of plans I make server work harder then someone with 300 artillery plans.
---
I know that used to be right, but I don't think that's true any more. It definitely used to be true in the days of split faction pools, but these days with the 1400 pool, I find that the cap pool refreshes at noon EDT whether I've traded or not.
---
I would love this because when I use a player's camp, I like to leave a little goodie bag at their front doorstep to thank them. However I'm always worried they won't see it, or they'll leave the server and disappear the camp and items forever. I'd much prefer being able to leave it in a persisting mailbox where they can retrieve the gift whenever they get back to their camp.
---
um, what financial need? Despite being disgustingly over priced, all of the weapon skins only apply to one weapon. Making them universal would actually increase sales as then you would actually be paying for something semi-worth 4-10$.
---
I still use mine but its pages are covered in my sticky notes for my updates and revisions.
---
Exactly what I said when the mode was announced. Legendaries kill any incentive to craft your own gear. Survival should have been just perks and plans based.
---
I liked the Easter Content, I get that its supposed to be a fun little addition, but some players want some actual good endgame content, and a camera that you take pictures with is the exact opposite of endgame content.

I'll usually do runs of around 30 to 50 maps between a handful of locations. Primarily bog, divide and mire. If I'm lucky every 3 or 4 days. Last night I got absolute garbage. The run before gave me BoS knight uniform plan, BoS combat legs plan and t51b helm plan. It's truly hit or miss.   Don't give up on it. The hardest part is getting the maps. I post to buy and always try to trade with random people for them. Buying on market, you'll spend 50-80c per map, I've had people give them to me for free or just a few caps. GL.
---
I fully understand the reason for limiting teams to 4 players, but it would be great if multiple teams could be allied with each other.
---
I’ve traded at all times of the day and I am having to wait 20 hours between trades still. It is definitely not a set time.
---
It seems **interesting** that all new weapons to 76 have comparatively few mods...
---
This same idea was top post these last few days. Don't tell me you all got the same idea at the same time.
---
This happened to a group early Saturday morning, but she stayed over the Flooded Trainyards fighting the miners and Super Mutants and never disappeared. My group nuked prime an hour or so later and when we spawned in, there she was flying around before the nuke hit.  We ended up with 2 queens to fight.
---
I talked with Chain Saw and his only response was a very threatening 'brum-brum-brum-brum'.  I hope Mr. Drill will talk with Chain Saw in person to work out these issues.
---
{Press \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ button
---
Wrong sub brudda
---
last night she just flew around for 15 minutes before dropping with 2 minutes left. Everyone unloaded into her but we failed the mission and she flew off only to return with slightly more health. We kept at in and with a sliver of health left she flew off once more and never came back. Stupid SB
---
Yea, because we haven't had a single update that has done that, the sheepsquatch event is small, and The Burrows dungeon was a total peice of shit.
---
Okay - fair enough. I must just be more predictable that I realise!
---
No problem, found your CAMP :)
---
Where are the best farms in your opinion bud ?
---
When I first started I thought it was a island with about 12 deathclaws tbh I was disappointed
---
Mine is in the land for 5 minutes straight
---
Ahe flew off and after a second landed again
---
So what you’re saying is that I have to level up 2 more times just so I can get the perk that I already spent 5 level ups on? No. That is a dumb idea.
---
Ok. Good stuff. Ill check out that other one
---
Might as well just add the repair tool from Battlefield, then.
---
Yes, how much you want it?
---
New weapon skins add whole new experience to the game and make people want to play. For some reason Bethesda failed to realize this and ignored a gold mine staring at them. Maybe their employees don’t play much games themselves. I got the chrome skin for minigun and liked the look, now I’m shooting mostly mini because of it.
---
I really hope they expand the no-build zone around the clubhouse before making that change.
---
 40 Mega Fonzies!?!  That's Bender-esque level coolness!
---
But if you leave it in an overseer's cache it stays put?
---
That would be great! I would even be happy with 6. There is always someone left out in our group so we often have to break ours up into 2 teams of 2 and 3 (or 3 and 3). We normally have 6 - 8 people in our chat anyway so having everyone in 1 team would be freaking awesome.
---
Yeah the Gatling counts against pistols for some reason...  but I’m not complaining it’s easier to get that done with the Gatling.
---
maybe /u/Valseek /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/BethesdaGameStudios /u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
thank you!!! ill try it tonight after work!
---
WesTek (or however you spell it) is pretty good, also white springs when its nuked is amazing. Uranium fever has also gotten me same amazing loot.
---
Or even scrap ammo.  I'm kinda back and forth on this.  On one hand, I have FAR too much ammo (and mostly use melee weapons anyhow).  On the other hand, things like mini nukes and missiles and cannonballs and such, I just can't let go of.
---
ill be very hoppy when i do! BAD PUN ALERT!
---
Just put /u/ before the reddit username to tag the person.
---
I guess I lost a little faith in the BOS because of them hiding from the world in NV. I am trying to remember the outcasts Unfortunately I have memory problems due to meds I take and can't remember where the Outcasts came into play.
---
I can get behind the idea that Mutant should stack based on the number of Mutations though.  When it comes to armor, it's also DR/ER, not a flat damage reduction, so what difference does +10 even make?  Hardly any.
---
The rest... eh.  Sentinel and Cavalier get into that same territory Explosive does where you wonder why they weren't top-level prefixes in the first place.  As long as it's high-level, and not bloody Wood Armor, the presence of Sent/Cav trumps pretty much any top-level prefix for me.
---
My friend did the same thing with his t-45.
---
We still dont know how it happened all I know is that he started begging bethesda not ban him on thoer website.
---
Be nice if they did. The mechanic exists in skyrim--for couriers, but we don't have npc's.
---
Nope. Same. It will disappear shortly after you log out. 
---
Unless I’m wrong, but from everything I’ve read that seems to be the case.
---
In Adventure, it would be griefing but in survival it's just another day. The "if you're red, you're dead" mantra is pretty much universal. Also, my base has been destroyed so many times I actually pack most of it up before I fast travel out to murder.
---
Hahahaha love it!
---
Why would damage resist negate bloodied? Bloodied is about health, not Armor.
---
Not bad at all once you prime it, the yield becomes close to 50 cal ammo. Of course you need fluorescent flux but those are easily available when WS gets nuked.
---
Someone should give me a Bloodied + Explosive  + 250 DR while reloading so I can test this... for science of course. Or 25% FR. I'm not picky!
---
Because Bethesda, basically
---
I always chalked this up to laggy servers. When i load into the area my client loads the enemies and then kills them once the server updated my client that they are supposed to be dead.
---
I've seen other creatures do this when I'm standing on a rooftop or other place that they can't reach.  Maybe she couldn't land and reach the player she wanted to eat.
---
Not saying you are mistaken since you know your build and your crew, but it works fine for me and my crew and we are all mutated to hell and gone.  I run it and share it with my guys. I don't know if it's a platform thing or what.  We play on XBOX.
---
Not everyone is into end game content and I have seen some posts about people getting excited for it since they do photography in real life.
---
What system are you on? I have several sitting on a mule. Im PS4
---
Beyond level 50, not much changes. 
---
Your health doesn't go up, you just have more perk choices.
---
Sure, they'd have better gear than the lower levels, but beyond 50, Gear is what's important.
---
Only the intiate paint is available atm. The others are being held back for other content according to a player who contacted customer service about the drop rates of the Forbidden Knowledge quest.
---
Well all im gonna say here is at level 150 I have been 1 shotted by a level 40 before.  
---
You dont know the sort of weapons they have, there are some crazy weapons out there with the right builds, and anything over level 50 is irrelevant since you don't get any more powerful or access to any more dangerous weapons after that
---
The Burrows I will agree did not live up to its hype at all, but the other stuff they put out has been fun.  Fasnatch and brewing were cool additions.
---
Yea, what he said ... West Tek is one of the best places currently ... As long as the rng doesnt have it in for you (which for me, he usually does), you should see at least 2 legendaries there every run (up to 5-6 I think ... or if you are me, in 3 runs, 2 ... =(
---
Other than that, I did Harpers Ferry alot (even before the nukes), the usual Whitespring farming, and ofc the Queen herself
---
Hey if its free its free
---
I'm loving the idea of expanding the junkie and berserker lines to be comparable to low-HP builds synergy-wise. I'd also solve an no-mutation and anti-mutation effects to be implemented. The bloodied synergy is perfect - it should be followed, not demolished.
---
I trade. I hunt for items that people neglect and get em to collectors. I don't ever craft ammo. I buy it by tens of thousands paid from profits from trading. Yep I spent my time but I spent it effective and hence can run for days without refilling. Resources or not, this particular change I proposed for auto rifles would still keep em very powerful, but would mean that auto rifles don't just one-shot most people. Also, its not like proper way to use them is to spray the magazine. When used in VATS, automated rifles are just quick-filling sniper rifles that sends a OHKO three times in two seconds.
---
I often play with groups of 4-8 players at once so yeah later teams would be a atoms end!
---
I agree they were cool additions, but they weren't endgame content players have been looking for.
---
Eh, they aren't that far off. Once you do have your maxed characters, hit the cap limit on all 5 character slots, and are basically completely full up on your stash and carry limit on all your characters as well. There really isn't much else to do. I've got all the cosmetic outfits from the pompadors wig to all the different variations of the asylum workers outfits, Got a full set of all the best end game armors. Have my Camp completely maxed out etc.
---
There really isn't much left, there are no challenging end game raids or bosses like other online games have to keep the hardcore players busy, Literally outside of the SBQ everything can be solod in about 10 minutes, and the SBQ isn't even worth running as her drops are garbage compared to a west-tek run.

I'm part of a discord group we have people from all over the world and willing to help eachother complete quests and gain endgame content etc you are all welcome to join us below is the link to our discord group

That may have been the case previously, but I can assure you that I got the Knight's paint from the Tech Data quest after around 100 turn ins a few weeks ago.
---
Not everyone does photography in real life.
---
I think they turned off the trade system or something, I keep hitting trade and it dosn;t go through.  
---
Was trying to tell you, I found a AA Gat, and didn't need yours, so was gonna offer you 100 caps for your troubles.
---
RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIIFE!
---
Say that to the brand new cooking stove with janky doors. Like slapping fresh paint on a turd.
---
And i just logged on to play
---
As long as I have waited, and as many times as I have checked I should have a 482% chance on my next attempt to find them...
---
Incoming "Have I been banned" posts.
---
sounds cool do it
---
He said lvl 1-50, what you just discribed is not lvl 1-50 play.  You answer actually supports my answer.
---
&gt; the perfect gear at the perfect Price
---
yeah, I know, many of us like to use the optimal stuff and in this game this is very demanding.
---
Well I’ll be damned then. Near launch people were tearing their hair out trying to get paints other than Initiate to drop. Thanks!
---
I duped a whole power armor some how - must be weird server ticks while doing certain actions.
---
What? Level 50 is max character.
---
Bought it for your troubles, because when the last trade menu finally came up, all your items showed up twice. Rather odd. Still, cheers and thanks, someone will find a use for it eventually :)
---
I need in game Mothman merchandise right now.. mothman plushie!! Mothman T-shirt!!! Yes yes!! Mothman themed lamp... how is that not already in the atom shop??
---
Yeah, the issue is that we don't have a good currency. People will only trade GG weapons for other GG weapons, and it has to be exactly what they want, otherwise they just hoard their stuff. I'm not blaming them - I do the same thing, but yeah, it's a problem. I hope that the legendary tokens are tradeable and have no carry weight. This will allow people to grind shit legendaries and have the option of trading them (in the form of reroll tokens) for convenience.
---
Oh shoot! Well, we did the trade anyway, message me when the servers come back up and I can either give you something worth your caps, or your caps back :)
---
I just got the breach and clear psn trophy, odd.
---
No...did u read my reply?
---
There is one more, "the quick fix" next week, that we know of at least.
---
It's a junkie's swing speed endurance switchblade, pretty mediocre after the other 5, honestly
---
At some point you get tired of farming legendaries and then you forgot how fun at was to walk around and check locations you forgot about
---
Is it possible that you learned it by applying the mod several times? Or scrapping them?
---
it took me 1 and half hours of server hopping to find a cave cricket..... like for real???
---
i remember a while back they added a "second load screen" to make sure the environment was finished before you started. but i only recall experiencing it once. did they get rid of that, or was that some kind of bizarre hallucination i had for like a week?
---
I love the idea, sadly I can't see Fallout 76 getting this. It takes a lot of resources to get this done for all the weapons. Maybe we will get this once mods are allowed in this game but till then we have to wait.
---
Hi, its the perk "250 damage..." which causes the damage drop. When you reload such weapon, then the damage is like you would have regular weapon, non-bloodied.
---
Yes, it is the one and only dlc we are ever getting and it's the best idea anyone working at Bethesda could come up with. Get your head out of your own ass and stop bitching for the sake of bitching.
---
[It would be like leading the small soldiers toys and it would be magnificent.](https://youtu.be/Ls5834hbssM?t=25)
---
Yes, and if we could make it ourselves, I think it would be less stressful. Of course it I can’t be too easy, but please I want an actual chance! (Farming nuked WS isn’t a good chance imo)
---
IDK seems like a giant oversight
---
I can see what you mean about crafting and stuff, that is a little bit silly, I wish I was around for fashnacht for that owl mask, I was taking a break from fallout after I hit 65 in the early days of the game, too many game breaking bugs, glitches etc, came back 2 weeks ago actually, I also missed the atom shop Nuka rocket girl outfit too :(
---
Would love this!
---
As for how much scrap to collect
---
I keep between 50-100 of each resource in my stash, with a few exceptions that are allowed to go higher (for me, thats Screws, Ballistic Fiber, Plastics and Acid, because these sell quite well imho)
---
Oh yea, and I forgot "Farming for Serum Recipes" and then "Farming Fluxes in Nuke Zones" ;)
---
AWOL event? I'm not sure if I've done this one yet.
---
I finally submitted a support ticket to bethesda to see what they said, and they said to exclude fallout from my antivirus. I haven't tried that yet but I will update when I do.
---
Come on fixing friends list!!!
---
I've noticed slow loading as well. Both on PS4 and Xbox1
---
* My regular PS4 seems to really lag on loading the environment, specifically decorative plants, shadows, and other ambient lighting. (It just looks very bright and you only see the tiled ground textures and trees)
---
* My XB1S struggles during events and when loading my camp. Because of the slow loading camps I can get into locked bases as they are loading in.
---
Yes, the Whitesprings shop you're talking about is called "Artisan's Corner", I think, and a lot of people (including myself) use it for vendoring and to stick unsellables in the cash register. It has at least one of each type of workbench and at least 2 stash boxes. I've been able to buy a few 1\*/2\* legendaries from the faction Protectron there for cheap that others have sold to it.
---
Also the syringer.
---
Yes, you claimed there is end game things to do. There really isn't. I did all this with my 5 characters and the highest level out of all of them is only 124. The rest is just spread out over the other 4 slots all of them are between 50 and 70. The only reason the one is level 124 is because it is my "main".
---
I never said they did, I said SOME PEOPLE are getting excited.
---
The burrows dungeon was a fucking dungeon. It was only shit relative to the instanced end game loot dropping raids all the idiots talked it up to be.
---
not everybody thinks their preferences should be more important than someone else's, either. you aren't interested in the camera, others are. let them enjoy it.
---
I’ve had these same issues, as well as the radio taking forever to come back on.
---
what places are you farming?
---
I mean, it’s a cool item to have, I think, but I suppose I can see your point in it not being a bigger event, sorry it wasn’t what you expected
---
I've gotten a lot of good Legendary loot going in after a nuke. Even more sometimes than during.  The Glowing Ones will usually continue to spawn for awhile after an event.  Especially along the row houses.  The Clubhouse used to be the same, but not since the nerf
---
Notice how I said "SOME players want endgame content"
---
I think the card picking should end at 60 levels.  That would incentivize folks to team up. People would truly become special. Warriors, repairmen, etc
---
The 20-30 seconds of load time are annoying, but it's still an improvement over the invisible teammate bugs that we used to have. It would be nice if they could improve loading, but not at the cost of returning to worse bugs.
---
Occasionally one of the workshops have a defend from scorchbeast event and occasionally the scorchbeast spawns across the map and slowly flies around in circles.
---
Closed for cleaning.  There should have been a little yellow folding sign placed on the manhole.
---
Yeah I feel you buddy, I’m in the exact place you are
---
It’s quite annoying how posts like these get downvoted also
---
Yeah, we will see what this legendary vendor offers. Hope they don’t screw it up.
---
Thank you sir!
---
I’m saying! Plus it’s an exclusive item, at least for now, until they release it for purchase in the atom shop, and return the event the following year which I’m assuming they’ll most likely do both
---
I meant mods with out the legendary effects
---
Some players should learn to read the road map. There's no end game content coming until the summer, the current dlc season is all quests and new features.
---
Just a heads up - you don't get high rad fluids or glowing / hardened mass if there isn't a nuke zone. Made that mistake once - farmed for over an hour before I realized that no, my drop rate didn't suck, they just couldn't drop it lol.
---
With a big chunk of the face missing It was a good mix of wacky and creepy
---
Thing is, i dont think its intentional. Every single patch has had some unintended change slip in mixed with stealthnerfs, its hard to tell whats a bug or whats a intended change due to the lack of detailed changelogs. We've had to rely (and still do) on dataminers to get the actual list of full changes post-patch.
---
Are we talking mole miner gauntlet or the Deathclaw? If its the mole miner, you can  learn to add the third blade.
---
I was on a server last night that didn’t show nuke on map but the atmosphere was nuked, sound effects was nuked, but no radiation, no mutated flora, no glowing ghouls just regular ones.
---
Never seen this recipe
---
It's perfectly natural, and most often happens from wearing armor that's too tight.
---
Huh... well im an idiot. Just realised where that mysterious extra power armor came from and now im wondering if i will still have 3 suits if i ever log back in.....
---
It does seem like the game has been unable to keep up lately, at least on PS4, more so than earlier. A few days ago I was farming Deathclaw Hands for crafting Gauntlets, and even a minute after loading into an area, the Deathclaws whom's AI was fully functional, was having a field day attacking me without appearing. I think the worst case was of loading in this case was almost two minutes, which felt a bit overkill.
---
Mere moments ago when I logged in just south of the Mire and ran up there, huge areas presumably hadn't loaded in their textures and were basically just glowing white/light colors all over the screen - which is quite painful to the eyes.
---
When I sprint across areas with 300+ AP and Custom Fitted, I understand why not everything around me loads in properly. But when you move around at snail pace and things haven't loaded in before you've left an area, when the game in this regard was more functional at launch, feels like a step in the wrong direction. I don't think it's all that gamebreaking for those of us that stuck with the game this long, and I'd rather have new content than terrain fixes once a week, but it does feel like one often comes at the cost of the other.
---
Oh man. Imagine accidentally blowing up someone's camp with a mini-nuke because you didn't know it was there and there was an enemy in the distance.
---
🤣
---
No possible
---
There are two kinds of royal jelly, one that is junk and scraps, and one that is aid and can be cooked or eaten.
---
Most of the spawns are for the former, to get the latter go to tangara town, in the south east of the mire across the river from the vender up the cliffs, climb all the way to the top and there should be a royal jelly either in the school or one of the houses, I can't remember, but it's there, I think it's above head level on a ledge.
---
It’s ridiculous to be honest. I bet if their was an issue with the atom shop not working they’d be all over it since generating revenue seems to be the primary goal rather than creating a functionally stable product
---
I'm more shocked that it's your main. The first time I was able to toy with a Dragon I took it out and in something like 10 shots it was broken. Screw that noise.
---
21\. Easiest source of black titanium so far.
---
If it's not legendary a couple hundred caps
---
Preach
---
Or one hits R instead of "T" for going into the perks.
---
As you know from the original roadmap, player vending is planned for May
---
How about those one star unyielding wood armor pieces? I’ve almost got a full set! enough to go out into the wilds and role play a tree!!!!
---
I can confirm this to be the case through my own testing yesterday. An Anti-Armor weapon did not change damage, but a Bloodied one did.
---
Awesome. Will do
---
Hadn't thought of that. Guess I'll keep a lookout for weightless gear from now on
---
Nobody I know plays Fallout
---
I’m literally the only person in the world with access to my account. But thanks for the suggestion
---
How do we actually know if we got the reward. I think I collected all the eggs. Does it just show up as craft able? Or does it notify you somehow that you got it?
---
I've seen multiple 5000 cap bounties in survival and each time the person was glitched into the ground and could not be damaged. They were there to draw people in to be killed by their friends. 
---
In one instance there were multiple people underground and they could jump up out of the world, shoot and fall back below. Once we figured out what was happening they died as they popped up but their loot bags went back underground. The person with the bounty never popped up unfortunately.
---
Since a lower level can use a higher level item like the pa , you could go to work bench and be unable to craft and it would be in your inventory easy pa dupe
---
I’ve reported this long ago still happens so fuckit
---
I had the same at Watoga, and noticed that no doors were present so stood next to the vendor behind the counter to try get a picture, but there was no room for it. Then the game finished loading and I was trapped behind with the vendor :(
---
No, a bunch of idiots just had some bad runs and since they don't understand what random means decided Bethesda secretly nerfed Watoga and only Watoga just to fuck with people.
---
Nerfing their VATS crit isnt the solution. They are shooting the exact same round from the same gun. The only difference is the frequency with which rounds are sent, and that disparity is already accounted for in the reduction of base damage. I think raising the others might have some merit, but reducing anything  if we are leaving something like a low health build in place is only going to lead to new imbalance. Instead of people having the option of going VATS Crit + Auto OR low health, all the min maxers will simply feel obligated to switch to low health. 
---
I totally agree though that there should be some competing builds and I think that allowing mutations to stack bonus damage by way of mutant's gear (even if just nominally per mutation since we are talking about 18) would be an awesome addition. I would also like to see some work done around a max health build. Vanguards is great but the additional DR is completely negated by other existing builds and perks. Instead of max health simply being a boost to defenses, a mechanic (be it legendary weapon effect and/or a new perk tree) to increase weapon damage in a meaningful way would add some parity. 
---
I also completely agree that there is a lot of room to grow with junkies and berserker and in fact have been doing some playing around with nocturnal as well, because it is already a meaningful damage bonus in the right circumstance and could greatly benefit from the removal of the damage nerf during the day, giving us another viable build - the nighttime assassin.
---
You really need to work on your small talk, this is getting repetive. So how's the weather on your side of being wrong?
---
&gt;Personally not that interested in the camera, will just have one around for the challenges.
---
Without knowing more on the camera other than it's being implemented into the game, this is what bugs me. That the challenges make camera acquisition/possession/maintenance a must for those in the community determined to complete them.
---
One more convoluted facet to challenge completion. I chuckle at myself for the lengths I will go to for the virtual ten or twenty cents to which most challenges equate.
---
And to think, out in the real world, the minimum wage discussion is a hot-button topic, but we gamers... we'll go out of our way to find: another player, wearing fisherman gear, fighting a Mirelurk Queen in a radstorm on a Wednesday at night while simultaneously eating a razorgrain bagel (note: bagel must have cream cheese applied) so that we can take a picture of said scene. Net gain: 10 atoms! Logical. :)
---
There hasn't been an update that has been even remotely huge
---
That’s kind of my thoughts on it too. Except I figure the tokens will be exchanged for a roll at a legendary.  Like 5 for a 1*, 10 for a 2*, and 15 for a 3*.  Something to give the game a sink for legendary inventory.  But we won’t really know until it’s actually here.
---
Just set a maximum number of cars or points that can be shared by each team
---
You should be able to look through windows and moan with those new pearly peeper binoculars as well.
---
Someone datamined those and I saw a legendary "unbreakable " piece.
---
I prefer to gift items directly.  Best way is to go Stealth on top of wooden bridge near the Overseers camp, then when they exit the bridge, jump down while wearing black Ultracite PA while howling like a banshie (mic cranked up loud) right in front of them, then drop the bag.  They get some good low level weapons, armor, ammo, Aid stuff and useful junk/plans, which tides them over nicely.  They also get an immense Adrenalin rush which should help with the first quest.  So far all of them have been too overcome with gratitude to actually thank me, but I will keep doing it.
---
Look at how different builds work and get the perk cards to mess around with different gear. See what you can kill with a pool cue. Take photos in various outfits
---
Just sort by new, when they’re up, we will know.
---
Wow, you are still crying? Wonder how long it will take before you realize I'm not even reading your comments anymore. LOL
---
I like collecting things in the game. Unique outfits, paint plans, and legendary weapons. I grind away until I have a legendary I like of each weapon. Different PA plans and mods. I have probably 8 different PA waiting for new skins or just different setups for different uses.
---
I loved it
---
Upon reading this, I feel I am somewhere between Mistress of Mystery and Responder/Firebreather
---
They will probably do something stupid today and nerf something that didn't need a nerf like white knight
---
What comments?
---
They had an instigating fatman for the challenge in survival last week.
---
then it would be like a Harvest Moon simulator...
---

---
At this point, I don't think it's in the game. However, I think it would've been a great easter-egg and cool mini-location to have to make the trailer feel closer to the game from an emotional stand-point.
---
Personally , I loved the free Easter eggs. I placed them all over my camp for others to find. As for the Easter Bunny Mascot head, I think it's flipping awesome. While I don't intend to wear it every time I play, I could see me pulling it out from time to time and hop around the servers. Now if I could just get Easter egg paint skins for mini-nukes; I could share my Easter eggs with everyone!!! :)
---
Thanks Bethesda for an awesome game and the free holiday gifts. I for one enjoy both!
---
Yeah, someone else mentioned! I wish I had realised! Damn.. Feelsbadman.
---
Sounds like you're thinking of Minecraft lol
---
And then in a few hours, why is atom shop content. It showing in my camp?
---
I honestly really respect this guy. He was clearly role playing as a raider, which is pretty cool. A "PvPer" would have taken the workshop and killed you instantly, then destroyed your camps as well for good measure most likely, and camped you until you rage quit.
---
You're doing it right. Min/maxing is an endorphine high with diminishing returns.
---
... which isn't a bad thing.
---
I like the idea, but I think that kind of control over your environment is better in single player games where you don't have to worry as much about play balance. The idea that some items can't be bought or made keeps us from all turning into minor gods.
---
Ya, true. Maybe it means it never ever breaks. Idk
---
Lately this has been killer for me : log in and run thru WS unnuked , 3/5 times legendaries spawn. And 2/5 3 star ones. After that run to the sheeps and if it's available , do it, if. If not server hop and do it again
---
The queen is definitely not worth the resources if I have to content with radiation. If the person is smart enough with their nuke placement, I might fast travel down and kill her but I'm not fighting her in a nuke zone.
---
FYI if you tag more than three people, none of them will get notified. It’s to prevent massively spamming by tagging a few hundred people at once.
---
I hope the player vending got tweaked and they can deliver later than originally promised but earlier than the rescheduled date.
---
Any idea where to get the harness plans. I've tried the raider vendors that the wiki says it's at and the one in Whitesprings but it's never there
---
No, a lot changes after level 50. This guy has 120+ perk cards that can alter damage, damage resistance, up to a 45% chance to not even take damage, reflecting damage, autostimming at 30% health, etc. Thats not even including mutations that can allow them to drastically increase damage, jumpheight, regeneration, visibility, and movement speed.
---
I'm level 100 and I'm much stronger than I was at level 50 even without armor because of those perks. A level 20-30 doesn't have the weapons to grind for all of those extra perks and dont have access to nearly as good weaponry and armors. 
---
I'm level 100 and have a bloodied ss that does 650 damage at least with all of my perks. When I was level 50 I had a ss that did 200.  When I was level 20 I had a fire axe that did 90. Gear is super important.
---
I'm just saying it isnt fair at all to say that the low levels are just salty and that the raider guy was just roleplaying. If you cant see that thats something only a toxic asshole would do then what even constitutes as toxic if not picking on lower levels for your own benefit bc they're easy targets. 
---
Sure you can still have those weapons at level 50 but they have a lot of perks that go with them that people dont usually buy with their available perk points at that low level.
---
Transparent Aluminum?
---
They aren't neutral, that's why every robot is still red. Just because you're not on their aggro list doesn't mean anything else changed. Plus neutral enemies are can end up legendary just like any other spawn, that's how you end up with spawns like Legendary Graham. Anyone telling you neutral mobs can't be legendary is talking out their ass.
---
I have over 70 pieces of wood armor... like 8 unyielding wood right arms...
---
I keep a bottle of water on my desk, so stay hydrated all day. Thank you for your concern though, at least you're not wrong about proper hydration.
---
It sucks it weighs 25 lbs. I rifle main and can't really justify carrying it.
---
Until it happens to them.

***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
Astute observers will notice my lists getting smaller, so I figured I'd add something to my list formula; the bug showcase! Every so often, I'll feature a few yet-unfixed bugs that I **personally** think should be higher priority!
---
* Plasma Cores incorrectly use the Fusion Core model - you can see the model they are supposed to use [here](https://imgur.com/a/It5MR0p)
---
* There are 2 floating curbs in Berkeley Springs, seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/hdt99x4)
---
* There are 2 holes in the Whitespring Resort walls where you can see the void: they are in the Aurum (where Helena resides), seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/jJkrh8K)
---
* Scouts' Life 10 incorrectly uses the Astoundingly Awesome Tales 6 inventory model, seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/aC9aJTE)
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Pip-boy flashlight doesn't properly illuminate items on tables/shelves; it is currently very difficult to see them, even if they are on a much lower plane relative to the player, as seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/IHMa4Xe)
---
* As of 4/9 patch, distant terrain textures don't appear to have lighting correctly applied to them, as they [appear incredibly bright](https://imgur.com/a/50V0W3R)
---
* Charging an Assaultron Head and then holstering it results in the player model [reflecting the shimmer/glow](https://imgur.com/a/PRk2WjE) of the weapon
---
* Plan: Assaultron Head incorrectly teaches you to craft the ['Imposter' variant](https://imgur.com/a/TdHL8TA); this is likely an error since you still can't craft the 'Imposter' variant, as it is meant to be an Atom Shop skin
---
	
---
* Cranberry Bog - The pollen 'spouts' frequently [fail to load in correctly](https://imgur.com/a/7kBbBeW), resulting in pollen appearing from thin air
---
* If you travel to a location where there is already a dead Angler (died before you arrived), their corpse will [continue to emit light from their 'lure'](https://imgur.com/a/9Dakohr) (these normally extinguish when they die)
---
* Cranberry Treasure Map #04 is [missing the word "Bog" in its name](https://imgur.com/a/j3O2BNv); every other map of this type is titled 'Cranberry **Bog** Treasure Map'
---
* The second version of the "Lantern" junk item is [missing its preview model](https://imgur.com/a/kG0v9EZ)
---
* Large/Small Baby Bottles and Vacuum Tubes [shine very brightly during the day](https://imgur.com/a/bvrUYfv), even when in relatively dim rooms or shadows
---
* Snaptail Reed item incorrectly uses the [Lure Weed model](https://imgur.com/a/sSxGxlS)
---
* The welding teddy bear easter egg in all 3 silos has multiple copies of bear/welding helmet/blowtorch on top of each other, taking one results in a [giant pile of items](https://imgur.com/a/4moYK2b) (this is the room the assaultron spawns in, just past the first security grid)
---
* Atomic Shop - Bone Raider Excavator Power Armor Skin - No longer displays any [images of the armor](https://imgur.com/a/H7fnrJG)
---
* The Firecracker Whiskey recipe and its derivatives are unobtainable, though it is possible that this is intentional (?)
---
* 'The Beast of Beckley' holotape has 2 transcribing errors; *"I found a dead bear, shredded by beasts."* should be *"I found a dead bear, shredded by**...something, I don't know.**"*, and *"Calvin would pay..."* should be *"**Crazy** Calvin would pay..."* based on ingame audio
---
* Event - Swarm of Suitors - This event awards no XP on completion
---
* Stealth Boy Mark III does not turn the player invisible, and doesn't actually get consumed on use
---
* Stealth Boy Mark III fails to play the Stealth boy animation
---
* Brawling armor mod (increased unarmed damage) does not increase unarmed damage
---
* Using aid items or other consumables (like plans/recipes) sometimes causes the game to crash
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Hotkey to toggle challenge tracking menu visibility on the map screen, tracking a lot of challenges blocks out a big chunk of the map
---
* Let us use Blank Holotapes to write our own notes! More roleplay!
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Ultracite Laser weapons could use a buff since they are currently weaker than lower level versions of standard laser weapons: a level 45 laser rifle does more damage than a level 50 Ultracite laser rifle, whereas the Ultracite Gatling Laser is superior to standard Gatling Lasers. Seems to be conflicting themes of whether Ultracite weapons are intended to be better or worse than standard laser weapons. 
---
* Don't be afraid to throw more skill/perk checks at us! The daily quest Pass the Buck is a great example; with Agility 5 you can shortcut the barrel disposal process, would love to see more skill/perk checks in future
---
Cheers!
---
I think survival needs to be a gamble. You die, you drop everything! 
---
If you bring your TSE weapon, be careful you may lose them!

On a positive note, there should be more Legendary Mobs with shared loot pool. 
---
If someone loots them, and you want that loot, you better kill him/her for it! 
---
Also, XP gain should always be double.
---
Is it actually lowering the damage though or is it only showing it as lowered in the pipboy. May just be a display bug.
---
Still crying. LOL pathetic.
---
ah ok thank you!
---
They already force us to use chems, brew alcohol, wear different outfits, fight certain monsters, use certain weapons - the whole challenge system is built to force us to do different things, that camera really isn't any different.
---
I agree though the lengths I have gone for a few atoms, even bought mixed drinks from someone for one of the brewing weekly challenges when I didn't have the recipe yet.
---
It's just expensive. You need to craft something to start the event and one component of it is only available at shops for 2300 caps
---
That my friend is a genius idea for the mini Nukes 😂 “ YOU GET A EGG, YOU GET AN EGG, AND YOU GET AN EGG, YOU ALL GET EGGS YOU ROTTEN BASTARDS! Hahahaha”
---
I disagree. Transparency is just another attribute on the object.
---
You Sir, might be the worlds greatest optimist.  Hope your’e right

FALLOUT 76: WILD APPALACHIA PATCH 8.5 NOTES – APRIL 23, 2019
---
We’re releasing Wild Appalachia Patch 8.5 today, which brings the ProSnap Deluxe Camera and two forms of Repair Kits to Fallout 76. We’re also making balance adjustments for some Aluminum items and applying a number of bug fixes. Catch a few highlights from today’s patch below, and then read on for the full patch notes.
---
PATCH HIGHLIGHTS
---
ProSnap Deluxe Camera: Find and equip this new functional Camera to snap photos more easily than ever before, begin the “Bucket List” quest, and complete Camera-related Challenges!
---
Basic Repair Kits: New single-use consumables that can be used to repair one item to 100% Condition without using any crafting materials. You can visit the Atomic Shop to purchase Basic Repair Kits.
---
Further below, we’ve also shared additional details on our thinking behind adding utility items like this to the Atomic Shop.
---
Improved Repair Kits: New single-use consumables that can be used to buff one item to 150% Condition without using any crafting materials. These are rare items that can be earned by completing some types of in-game content.
---
Balance Adjustments: Aluminum Trays, Oil Cans, and Empty Cans now provide Aluminum when scrapped and we’ve increased their base Cap values.
---
PATCH VERSION
---
Download sizes for today’s patch will be approximately 2 GB for consoles and under 1 GB for PC.
---
PC: 1.1.3.11
---
PS4: 1.1.3.9
---
Xbox: 1.1.3.7
---
WILD APPALACHIA
---
NEW FEATURE - PROSNAP DELUXE CAMERA
---
The ProSnap Deluxe is a functional in-game camera you can use to fill your Photomode Gallery with snapshots of your adventures.
---
The ProSnap Deluxe can be equipped and favorited like a weapon.
---
Use the “Aim” button to look through the Camera’s lens, and then press the “Attack” button to snap a photo.
---
You can use a Tinker’s Workbench to build a ProSnap Deluxe and apply mods, like lenses.
---
The Camera uses Film to take photos, and you can use the Tinker’s Workbench to craft additional Film.
---
When you take aim with the ProSnap Deluxe, it will also display the names of nearby locations and creatures it recognizes in the viewfinder.
---
Learn to craft a ProSnap Deluxe Camera by finding a broken one on the corpse of a tourist who met their end in the Wasteland.
---
Once you’ve acquired a Camera, you’ll begin the new “Bucket List” quest, which allows you to finish the tourist’s photography collection, if you so desire.
---
Many new Camera-related Challenges have been added to Fallout 76 that you can complete using your ProSnap Deluxe.
---
GENERAL
---
NEW CONSUMABLE UTILITY ITEM – REPAIR KITS
---
Repair Kits are new, single-use consumable items that immediately restore the Condition of an item in your inventory. They come in two forms: Basic Repair Kits and Improved Repair Kits.
---
BASIC REPAIR KITS
---
Each Basic Repair Kit you own can be used to restore one item in your inventory or Stash to 100% Condition.
---
Basic Repair Kits do not consume any of your crafting materials when repairing an item.
---
Additionally, they cannot be crafted, dropped, sold to vendors, or traded with other players.
---
After acquiring a Repair Kit, use it by opening your Pip-Boy, finding an item that you’d like to repair, selecting the “Inspect/Repair” option, and then choosing “Repair Kit"
---
The number of Repair Kits you own will be displayed to you on the “Repair Kit” button in the “Inspect/Repair” menu.
---
Basic Repair Kits are unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you’ve purchased or those you’ve earned by completing in-game challenges.
---
Please note: If you purchase Basic Repair Kits by entering the Atomic Shop from the game’s Main Menu, they will be added to your most recently played Character’s inventory. Prior to purchasing Repair Kits, please ensure you’ve logged into a world with the character that you’d like to receive them.
---
IMPROVED REPAIR KITS
---
Each Improved Repair Kit you own can be used to buff one of the items in your inventory or Stash to 150% Condition.
---
Like Basic Repair Kits, Improved Kits cannot be dropped, crafted, traded, or sold, and do not use any of your crafting materials when consumed.
---
Improved Repair Kits are not available in the Atomic Shop. They are rare items you can earn by completing in-game content.
---
They are currently dropped as loot by the Scorchbeast Queen and may be added as rewards for other types of in-game content in the future.
---
If you own both Basic and Improved Kits, you will be prompted to select which type you’d like to use when repairing an item.
---
A NOTE ON UTILITY ITEMS IN THE ATOMIC SHOP:
---
First, thank you to everyone in the Fallout 76 community who took the time to share their feedback and concerns about adding a utility item like Repair Kits to the Atomic Shop. Over the past couple weeks, we’ve examined all the feedback and today we want to share our thinking when it comes to these types of items and how they relate to the Atomic Shop. When we originally announced the Atomic Shop last year, we said that it will not provide anything that offers a competitive advantage. We remain committed to that statement and take it into account when we evaluate every new item that we bring to the Shop, both now and in the future.
---
While Repair Kits do offer a way to fix an item in the field, we feel you will find that they are a convenient option you can utilize during your adventures. If we find that Repair Kits do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that advantage is removed.
---
Aside from purchasing Atoms, you can also unlock Basic Repair Kits using Atoms you’ve earned from Challenges. Additionally, the more powerful Improved Repair Kits will not be available in the Shop and can be earned by completing in-game content, like killing the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
DESIGN AND BALANCE
---
Junk: Aluminum Oil Cans now each grant 1 Aluminum when scrapped, rather than 1 Steel, and the can’s base value has been increased from 9 to 13 Caps.
---
Junk: Aluminum Trays and Empty Cans now each grant 2 Aluminum when scrapped, rather than 2 Steel, and their base values have each been increased from 1 to 10 Caps.
---
SOUND
---
News Screen: Sound effects have been added and will play when interacting with the News Screen.
---
BUG FIXES
---
C.A.M.P., CRAFTING, AND WORKSHOPS
---
Blueprints: Attempting to add an object that was built on top of another object to a Blueprint, such as a chair on a foundation, no longer sometimes prevents the Blueprint from including those objects.
---
Bulb Lettering: The letter “W” now correctly lights up when powered and activated.
---
Wall Décor: The Nuke Mobile is now correctly located in the Wall Décor build menu rather than Lights.
---
CHALLENGES

---
Rad Storm Challenges: Nuke zones now count toward Rad Storm-related Challenges, such as the “Kill a Glowing Creature in a Rad Storm” Daily Challenge.
---
ITEMS
---
Apparel: All Fasnacht masks are now immune to Condition damage.
---
Headwear: The Baaad News Billy mask is now correctly located in the Headwear crafting menu rather than Outfits.
---
Mods: Found Mods can now be correctly applied to Power Armor and weapons.
---
Weapons: The Salvaged Assaultron Head’s crafting requirements now correctly include the Science Expert Perk rather than the Gunsmith Perk.
---
PERFORMANCE AND STABILITY
---
Loading: Fixed an issue that could cause players to encounter an infinite loading screen.
---
Performance: Implemented an improvement to reduce hitching while running the game client.
---
Stability: Fixed an issue that could cause the PC game client to crash after exiting to the desktop from the Main Menu.
---
Stability: Addressed an issue that could cause the game client to crash when entering the Atom purchase screen from the Atomic Shop.
---
QUESTS AND EVENTS
---
Encryptid: Individual Pylons during the Encryptid Event will only register one interaction at a time and only count as one of the three required Pylons.
---
USER INTERFACE
---
Photomode: Players who have unlocked the Looking to the Future Pose can once again select and use it in Photomode.
---
Pip-Boy: Item stats now correctly remain visible when inspecting an item in the Pip-Boy.
---
Power Armor: The Bone Raider Excavator paint preview image no longer incorrectly appears when inspecting unpainted Excavator Power Armor.
---
Repair: Item stats now remain visible after entering and exiting the Inspect/Repair menu.
---
Scoreboards: Survival Beta Scoreboard icons on the Map now correctly update to reflect new rankings after a player disconnects from a world.
---
Scoreboards: The first score type listed on the Survival Beta Scoreboard now correctly matches the Top 3 for the week.
---
Shop: Addressed an issue that could cause controls to become unresponsive upon returning to the Main Menu after exiting the Atom purchase screen.
---
Social: The Friends List once again sorts friends based on their current status: Online, Online Different World, Main Menu, Offline, Ignored, and Blocked.
---
Workshops: The Corvega Small Water Purifier variant is now correctly marked as a premium item in the Workshop build menu.
---
Level doesn't matter. Source - my lvl 6 killing level 80s in 1-2 shots, and a level 30 one shot killing my level 300. Damage and armor are normalized to the point where pvp is almost always a 1 shot shit show unless you're running a godmode assn/sent build with proper consumables and perks.
---
That’s not happy
---
Dont know If its just for me or.. But i hate when you come across a camp, or your own camp, and Only parts or none of it has loaded in yet, mostly after loadingscreen, and can result in that you get stuck etc. Hope they fix that and the stability so it wont get so laggy from time to time
---
yeah let me holster my sledgehammer that has a rocket attached..
---
if it is like fallout 4 it applies a Quad effect to the durability of the piece in question. 
---
normally obtained on  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tessa%27s\_Fist](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tessa%27s_Fist)
---
Can confirm was shooting, luckily we chased it down fast enough. Can't chase down the still common disconnects though.
---
I'm level 168ish and in all the scorchbeast queen and sheepsquatch events I dont think I can ever recall anyone using a pistol. That being said try buying a two shot explosive pistol so that way you can combine the two perks
---
I'm still bitter about this egg thing, it was only available to me for 3 days then disappeared from the atom store.
---
Well played! Sounds to me like you handled it just right sir. I love it when good players get the upper hand on the asshats.
---
Just posted - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bggxol/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_85_notes_april/
---
If you place on floor next to a foundation, you can then snap a foundation where the plants are.
---
I believe I was able to get them all (Initiate thru Elder)...after weeks of farming. Well worth it. Looks great on my BOS character. Good luck.
---
Is it an actual patch or just server side today?
---
I'm a heavy main, with 3 star bear arms, so they're a whole two lbs for me. I also run ordinance express.
---
I'm the guy that turns up to SBQ or Imposter and lays down 10 - 15 nukes and obliterate the smaller mobs so everyone else can do their thing. XD
---
It isn’t, but I will post a picture to show it.
---
When aiming the barrel and reticle aren’t aligned.
---
I stats remaining while inspecting fixed. Yes!
---
Never seen a high level person run pistols before so idk
---
Nukalurks! \*ScreamLikeLittleGirlWithJoy!
---
I'm doing my good deed for the day by volunteering my time to entertain the handicapped.
---
This is good for the soul.
---
Oh i thought they were gonna, add player vending aswell, when is this, comming?
---
those are different, the leather coats have no armor at all and this has armor from head to toe
---
Why not?
---
PC is the same. I mean loading works pretty quick, but it can take 3-4 minutes before the world fully loads.
---
so its literally just luck who hit more/better crits when i spawn and instant try to crit with my vats crit comando build? because i think theres no better way i can crit more... its like every second bullet is a crit for me atm
---
Doesnt work you have to reload every single shot. Sucks was so hyped when I got one.
---
If used the gun perks it last longer and repaired to 200% it lasts a decent amount it does a ton of damage because of the effect.
---
Nah, you're good. In the end, it's only caps (and now you see why I rarely trade). And if nothing else, either someone's going to find a lucky awesome AA gun in the trash can in Whitesprings some time, or it'll be another thing to lug to the Legendary Vendor in due tome (I hope there is a stash near them, because I've been saving a lot of stuff to lug).
---
And how do I know where the edge of the workshop is? It's not my workshop, so I can't open the build tab and find the green fence. How do I know what is stealing and what is not? There is no indication whatsoever until you're already wanted. 
---
Many workshops are only a portion of a much larger zone. In fact I can only think of 2 that encompass everything in an area. If I'm trying to help someone restart their power plant, am I just not allowed to loot anything in there? Seems like a poor way to treat someone trying to help. But no, somewhere there's an edge where the workshop ends and the regular environment begins. Somewhere there's a line between stealing and taking free stuff, but it's invisible. That doesn't make any sense.
---
So far 4 comments and still hasn't even realized I'm not reading what you are saying. LOL
---
Keep letting those tears out though, I'm sure you've needed to for a while.
---
its an outfit, the raider armor doesnt have any of these pieces and i doubt theyll make a "paint" that changes it THAT much (besides it has a unique helmet so even more likely) the only set that changes alot with paint is the bone excavator paint.
---
Hey man I refer to auto rifle from perspective of playing the worst thing there is - auto rifle bloodied vats sneaky sniper. This combination is too much, IMO. I think rest of the elements of my build are very fine, and the only thing thats ridiculous is the frequency at which I can sent OHKO shots. Touch anything else to balance my build, you'll fuck it up for some other build. Lower auto rifles crit modifier, and I'll still shred through a sentinel wielding guy, but instead of doing it instantly, I'll need two seconds, and this is fine. Right now vats semi snipers are vastly weaker than vats auto snipers while in vats range. I think they should be different in gameplay, and they are - they both do same thing but one does it faster.
---
Yeah, I check it occasionally and buy the really cheap/light armor and weapons people vendor, because the leg vendor is a month away, in theory :)
---
Nice, hope it’s not nerfed after this patch. I just got a raider powers assent weapon weight last night by a super mutant in Watoga. Yay!
---
Rip comments section. *something bout repair kits*
---
Was there an update? 2 of us played and we were both able to get all the keycards and the keys. Only one of us could get the plans though. One thing to note. we noth generated the one time use key, and only the 2nd key worked. I thought maybe each player got their own.
---
This and the ability to actually play pool on a pool table
---
Congrats on the shocks. I had them a few patches back, but the repair bug ate them for the steel. I have yet to find them again and believe me, I've been looking!
---
That would make too much sense
---
you could try going to the adventure server to trade, then return to survival for play.
---
I've only ever seen one jet pack, one calibrated shocks, and one reactive plates the entire time I have played and checked. Maybe one day we will be able to buy the plans like every PA type.
---
Repair kits do not belong in the shop.
---
How are mules a clear advantage? That would be like saying having a friend who rarely plays that will hold gear for you is "a clear advantage in your use of service".
---
Especially when Bethesda themselves have already said mules and such are completely fine and they don't care about them.
---
I'm not saying whether I agree with the idea. I'm saying why they did it.
---
Either way, you leveled up a perk when you clearly didn't need that.
---
in my freetime/when messing about i wear a mix of raider and bone excavator with the imposter sheepsquatch head and a gas mask.
---
i feel like a warlord!
---
Ah, yes. The 'pay for convenience' route.
---
&gt;Balance Adjustments: Aluminum Trays, Oil Cans, and Empty Cans now provide Aluminum when scrapped and we’ve increased their base Cap values.
---
&gt;Rad Storm Challenges: Nuke zones now count toward Rad Storm-related Challenges, such as the “Kill a Glowing Creature in a Rad Storm” Daily Challenge.
---
These are two really good QoL changes.
---
[](/discentiaangrysquint)&gt;You can visit the Atomic Shop to purchase Basic Repair Kits.  
---
You've lost karma.
---
I'm thinking about using it to drill holes in my wood armor to reduce weight. Maybe put a screw bit attachment on there and I can screw some deep pockets on my wood armor pieces.
---
Well if you change your mind let me know. I've got about 15,000 rounds of 5mm stocked up and I'd be happy to throw some your way.
---
so the repair kits will not be craftable and will be a 1 time purchase per batch of atoms. pfft. im gonna stick to blowing mine on Power armor paints
---
Is that why spotlights have been broken since 2015?
---
Atom store: 1200 points incoming
---
*Tedious*...
---
(No, this is my good deed for the day. Always help the less fortunate.)
---
Who's a good boy? Are you a good boy?
---
Allow screws to be crafted! I’m always running out
---
Well isn’t this an unpleasant patch. Nothing to look forward to at all. You guys must be a glutton for punishment. Why would you guys introduce items for real life currency that gives and edge or something other than cosmetic deals? You guys promised that you wouldn’t do it but here we are... way to back out of your word and accommodate the whining population that wants the game to be insanely easy. 
---
You guys are listening to the wrong crowd. They are going to destroy the game more and I’m betting after this stunt, several fans are going to lose respect for the company. If you’re going to introduce items like this, make them earn it. Just like the 150% coming from the queen. I sure hope there’s a timer and conditions to be able to repair. It better only be useable at a bench. If not, you guys screwed up bad and didn’t even think the possibilities through.
---
I forgot to include that I change my crit perks out when I switch between auto and semi auto. Four Leaf Clover is significantly more powerful when using my autos than it is while using my semis and the inverse is true about Critical Savvy when using my semis vs autos. So those two get swapped and I would say that for the most part, the rate at which I am able to execute a critical is very close. They both equal out to being about a trigger pull or two between eligible crits in VATS.
---
In before this sub goes up in flames again
---
Holy crap you still haven't ran out of tears yet?
---
So, they're still going all in with the non-cosmetics in Atomic Shop? They decided that they'd simply change their messaging from "non-cosmetic, non-p2w" to simply "non-p2w" and just hope that everyone is going to roll over on it?
---
that does seem strange, some of the drop rates for items seem to have been changed
---
Low level too. It's like the poor little death claw that couldn't, instead of the intimidating "DETH KLAW IZLAND!!!!111ONEONEoneone....."
---
Ah, so the backlash did get ignored. So it begins.
---
Still not to stoked about the repair kits in the shop...
---
It's not a faction but it should be, cryptid worshippers/hunters (cult of mothman, cult for the interloper, the agency Wolf is communicating with etc). Give them a dungeon that's a nesting ground for some type of cryptid(s). You'd have to go down to try and control/wipe out the nest to prevent a huge surge of say snallygasters from escaping. I just want more cryptid stuff. They're the most interesting looking enemies and I'd like to see more. These "unsolved" quests we've been getting have been good but not enough for me
---
If it is repaired to 200% durability it will last me 180 shots which is kind of garbage
---
Mods are fixed ... YAY 
---
But no word of the vendors missing stuff
---
Cameras ... who cares
---
Repair Kits ... pfff, yea right ... thanks for letting us know that we CAN buy them with Atoms we owned ingame ...
---
Run for your life and break line of sight as soon as you spawn. Hide and wait for someone hunting you. If they come, ambush. If they dont, move back keeping yourself obstructed from potential shooters. Circle the area and come in from different direction. Wait for the shooters to expose themselves and mark em with recon scopes. Get to position for clear shoots and eat them. Its not about who shots first. Its about not giving yourself up on a plate.
---
My group of friends love it, we were running around hopping mad last night as the bunny cult.
---
You know, I feel badly about the last post.
---
Who's a good [gender neutral moniker]? Are you a good [gender neutral moniker]?
---
That looks better.
---
Theres a difference between ACTUALLY new players and alt accounts that are given whatever legendaries and upgrades along with a planned out build. People who are actually new players, are young and dont know much about grinding, or people who dont care and just want to play a new game with their kid dont become the op 90 second sbq killers that you know. 
---
Just admit that the guy's an asshole for picking on some random level 20's and trying to get their junk so that he won't destroy their workshop that he's going to take over anyways. He's not kind for not taking it without warning, he's just an asshole with some twisted manners.
---
Wait until I find Todd Howard's camp....
---
I think it's great that they decided to make the better repair kits be earned in game. And I'm excited about the camera!!
---
Wow, still crying 2 days later.
---
I do advise you to read the patch notes. They made a statement about it.
---
it could be an issuse with servers, i'm on ps4 and had trouble in the past with the frame rate and stuttering
---
Just waiting on that legendary vendor.... I don’t know how it’s going to work, but I have a looooot if legendaries stashed away.
---
Did you guys seriously just flat out ignore the fact that we said we didnt want this in the game?
---
Honestly, BGS should just learn from WoW and take a lot of the features there and adapt them.
---
* Mailboxes
---
* Text Chat with global, local, trade, party, clan, etc. (with the option to leave them obviously) - yes I realize there's a mod, but I have to reconfigure my fallout76.ini file every time I play to use it.
---
* Social features like clans (call it 'player factions') with clan bases / communities.
---
* Deeper crafting systems and crafting quest chains.
---
* Item to Item trading (the wow trade system is as bare bones as it gets but it's still more robust than Fallout 76's).
---
* Lots of stuff I probably can't remember.
---
Player vending is coming on May 7. Here is the link to the Roadmap [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
I wonder when we get that decorate C.A.M.P thing :/
---
you laugh, but i would love that. i'm currently trying to get a full unyielding wood set. i got my bloodied ripper to 399 dam per tick with no alcohol or meds. just perks. if i had wood armor, i could shred the wasteland sneakily.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Thats crazy you would need like 4 characters lol. Gotta do what you gotta do I guess. It is a great weapon.
---
Bethesda, you lied to us.  You broke your fucking word, that you made, multiple times.  "Cosmetic only" was the promise.
---
Yeah, I see it, I’m just trying to figure out how the hell it even occurs. They should be totally separate mechanics!
---
Yes, they do rad damage.  It's a solid choice against bloodied builds.
---
Seems like an OK addition to me.
---
That is really unfortunate, hopefully it blows up so they will actually fix it.
---
Who's a woozy! Who's a woozy goo! You're a good [gender neutral moniker]! Yes, you are!
---
They need a steady stream of monthly sales since they aren’t selling season passes or DLC.
---
I was going to comment this almost word for word. I remember my first time ever playing 4 on launch, I thought my game was bugged, I couldn't understand why they removed it.
---
Yell over the mic in a shrek voice
---
"Get out of my swamp!"
---
You on ps4?  Can I have your things?
---
No one cares drama queen.
---
Seriously, I've caught a dozen diseases because I load into the water next to my camp without my Fire Breather helmet on.
---
Same with me but with the in game black cowboy hat. It's a good look for my rifle character
---
You're the first person to report getting BOS plans from maps. We had another thread and it was a negative from all posters (small number).
---
Thanks.
---
They do already have a statue, a sleeping bag, a power armor paint and a gigantic billboard all dedicated to Mothman love.  I like the mothman plenty, and I feel like I can easily profess my appreciation loud and clear with those options.
---
sneak attack the belly with an instigating lever. they all go down in one.
---
When can we decorate C.A.M.P? When is it coming??
---
I have 10 :)
---
lol I can't tell if this is a sarcastic post.
---
Same man. It got to the point where keeping all the 1 and 2 stars wasn't feasible anymore, even using multiple mules. I hope turning in 3 stars gives substantially more reroll tokens, because I have a few hundred.
---
You just had to listen to the community, everything you did good in the past is gonna be ignored thanks to the Repair Kits. Such a silly move...
---
Couldn’t they have waited for this game to be more stable before adding stuff like this
---
The only ones dropped by the queen are the advanced version not in the shop. The regular version that its in the shop is available in game for free as well.
---
Great, finally they fix the MODS!!
---
&gt;They even acknowledged that it's p2w.
---
They did not.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw_sanctuary
---
Brace yourselves for repair kits is p2w/bethesda break up posts!
---
I laughed when I read ‘if these are shown to give an advantage, we will adjust’. 
---
So where does the line get drawn for convenience versus advantage?
---
That got set to zero when they first announced the repair kits three weeks ago.
---
I can easily see the station's door have something to do with the Brotherhood, a quest/dungeon where they investigate to try to get connections back up with Elder Maxson. This could include terminals/notes from astronauts on the space station and we could find out why it went down etc.
---
I think you’re wrong and he’s right. I tried to do the “picture of a player in sunglasses In a nuke zone” challenge in PA with the helmet off for glasses, I took noticeably more rads as soon as I took off my helmet. More than just the rad resist of the helmet should account for.
---
Way to go Bethesda, you go back on your promise of cosmetics only.
---
The worst is when other people travel to my CAMP, and I can tell its not fully loaded for them as I watch them walk through my walls and such to get to me. I've built a little trading post with a trade counter and all my customers are always able to just walk through my walls and trade with me.
---
Yes. We have been through this already.
---
Lol this again
---
Says the guy coming on to the thread to bitch at the OP just for the sake of it.
---
Game issue. Same on my pc. Some caves become buggy as hell even though they are virtually empty.
---
Don't be such a baby.
---
Most of the people you came across anyway for a long time in this game were nice and helpful. It's only in recent times that you find the trolls.
---
I know we got a lot of mothman things but the bed is just too small and who wants to sleep on the ground and get diseases? 
---
But you're right.. we need more... deathclaw MERCH :U I want a badass deathclaw power armor skin with big horns and claws on the hands... yes!! 
---
But you are right -I was actually really disappointed in the Uncanny Caverns? I was originally kind of spooked of going in there and then it wasn't really scary at all and I think getting something more than a photo frame would have been nice.
---
I thought so as well, the onpy ones effects that dont function is the cryo and flamer right? I am almost positive my tse gatling plasma does rads also it does to me when im too close to the shots.
---
Drifter is my go-to outfit. But I wish I could change the foot wraps to boots or something.
---
They are not good anyway
---
Your title literally says “only dropped by the queen” which is not true
---
As long as I can get the improved repair kits in game, I'll be fine.
---
I for one am very excited for the new camera! Can’t wait to try it out.
---
Especially since you can get the better ones in game. 
---
And weapon artisan is better than them anyways.  So its effectively going to be solely used for ranged. As the overbuff wont be as good in terms of melee.
---
Wasn't there a skeleton holding a camera on one of the camden park rides? maybe that was changes to the new camera.
---
Well..
---
Can at least one update be a huge event? I've yet to see one.
---
Careful, reload the game to check that it's still there.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll have your gear.
---
Actually, I've seen them attack players, realise they can't win then will fast travel/log out.  
---
Either way it's something every other game stops and it should be stopped.
---
I'll take your stuff if you're on PC. I'm still confused about what people are "winning" with repair kits. Especially when you don't have to spend real money on them. It's not like this is an e-sports tournament with a $100,000 grand prize...
---
That is DPS vs per shot damage. I agree, one is superior for DPS and to an extent that it could be argued that the other is obsolete, if we are talking about just damage dealt. But as I mentioned earlier, there is another cost hidden in there for resource farming. Most players do not buy thousands of rounds at a time, they play the game to go acquire the resources they need to support their build. That is not a non-factor in the viability of a build for most folks, and leads people like me to at least keep my options open on semi auto so I can fall back on it when I dont want to spend as much time hitting the weight rooms and killing super mutants for their assault rifles to scrap for steel haha. 
---
I thing a more elegant solution would have been retaining crit banker from FO4 and leaving it applied only to semi auto weapons. It would be more powerful than crit savvy and would provide some separation between autos and semi autos without illogically reducing the crit bonus for one or the other.
---
Random encounter
---
See ya thanks for the purchase lil bich
---
I dibs if Xbox
---
Wait it's today ?!
---
repairing items are now p2w aparently
---
\&gt;Implying I'm a griefer  
---
If someone attacks me, they realise they can't win so ALT+F4/log out isn't that them griefing?
---
Only from SBQ. So low level and new players are fucked.
---
I dont mind the bullet sponge bosses but dont give them a time limit, make it one or the other not both. 15 min for the imposter Sheepsquatch is way to short. Especially if you're hoping randoms will just join you. I've only tried fighting the SBQ twice just by joining the event and once we timed out and once we killed her with under 5 min left. It's just to short since the blast zone lasts for 3 hours (I think).
---
Got a T-60 jetpack plan, put it in the train station suitecase yesterday.
---
Bethesda doesn't consider the repair kits as a PTW advantage. Does it really though? It certainly is an advantage you pay for IMO.
---
Incredibly disappointed with these “balance changes” when are stealthboys going to be addressed? These items should reveal you when you take damage or are attacking, they shouldn’t be offensive weapons.
---
This is my swamp!
---
i got another bug for your list, if you got the bone excavator unlocked for SOME reason you can apply it to the T-51 LEFT arm (only left.. no other pieces sadly)
---
Yeah, but a lot of us at least hoped they'd back out of actually doing it if we made enough noise. I guess not.
---
I accidentally bought the rabbit plushie haha 200 atoms down the drain... Hahah
---
reload crouching, works correctly
---
Still don't see myself ever using these.  If they stick to it and keep it for convenience, I don't care.  If it becomes p2w, I'll leave.  I've gotten 500+ hours out of this game, more than my money's worth at this point.
---
Farm legendaries for a while then give them legendaries to an alt so you can have fun and re explore the map with better gear
---
Repairing them for money is.
---
Me too!
---
I get people are mad about the repair kits, but there’s some good stuff in here too. 
---
I’m also excited for the backpacks, player vending, and the legendary vendor. A lot of stuff to look forward too.
---
Just the concept of having game changing items available for purchase irks me.
---
Just a heads up, there's no X-01 Mod Plans as of yet though, just loose mods 👍
---
&gt;First, thank you to everyone in the Fallout 76 community who took the time to share their feedback and concerns about adding a utility item like Repair Kits to the Atomic Shop. Over the past couple weeks, we’ve examined all the feedback
---
No, what you've done is ignored the feedback in favor of making money.
---
It's irrelevant if the repair kits offer a competitive advantage or not. You lied to your customers. You promised a cosmetics-only atom shop and you broke that promise for no other reason than greed. Making these kits uncraftable, tradeable, droppable (enjoy either having them take up stash space or destroying them permanently!) or sellable is just the cherry on the cake.
---
This is just more proof that you are not worth the trust of your consumer base, and this after the disaster that was this game's launch, the evident huge lack of QA testing on any of the patches (if you had any decent QA testing, the workbench repair bar/mod application bug would never have hit public build and been an issue for two consecutive weeks until ''patch day''.), the nerfs constantly omitted from patch notes (queen no longer dropping serum BPs which has made them unobtainable unless traded, all food being ''changed to spoil at the same rate'' just meaning it all spoils **just as fast**, Watoga legendary spawns- you name it), the downright idiotically high prices of Atom Shop skins, the rising grindyness of daily challenges to make Atoms harder to earn, the ABSURD mask drop chance in the Fasnacht event- list goes on.
---
Anyone preaching that this game will be ''turned around like NMS'' is holding on to false hope. They are not listening to your feedback. This game is a money grab and this is proof of it.
---
Honestly that’s the only thing out of the bundle that was decent imo lol. I wish I would’ve accidentally bought the silver excavator power armor since I was on the fence about it lol
---
In PvP bloodied melee is a dying meta, I know 2 people who run it and it's extremely difficult, 
---
as for PvE? You can't fight a group of those charred ghouls without getting handed thanks to the ridiculous rad-damage.
---
The Bomber Jacket is pretty dope. I think it's called Bomber Jacket.
---
To be fair Bethesda's new game blades is one of the worst mtx skinner boxes ive ever deleted off my phone.
---
If you place the sleeping bag on a created floor in your CAMP, you can't be diseased.  If you place it directly on bare ground, then it has a disease chance.
---
Creative as hell! Too bad I'm on PC and cannot join you for brewskis.
---
This affects you *HOW* exactly? You don't want to spend Atoms on them, then don't. I figure I'll have 20 improved ones from queenie by the end of the week, so I couldn't care less.
---
4 player Instanced Vault Raids are further along the road map
---
It's an actual patch, apparently just under 1gb for pc and about 2gb for consoles
---
oh bless\~ i was not aware! ty
---
Let’s be honest:  you weren’t buying Atoms anyway.
---
Meh. Unless they ramp up the breakdown speed of items, I honestly don't give a shit.
---
If you're dumb enough to buy these things, when everything you require is easily found in game... that's a "you" problem.
---
Want to make this stuff go away? Don't buy them in the atomic store. But... players will buy them, thereby proving the effectiveness of the marketing tactic, and cementing them in place. 
---
The power is in your hands, players. I'd say "don't fuck it up".. but... you'll fuck it up. You always fuck it up. Everyone bitches online, but buys this shit anyways. So, I have a really hard time getting upset about it.
---

It makes way more sense in 76 as pulling up the pipboy doesn't pause the game.
---
At lower levels it's not that easy.

[Trust me I'm an engineer](https://imgur.com/gallery/ri8xg)

Would be nice
---
Supposedly people with repair kits are invincible? 🤷‍♂️
---
Found jetpack plans for T-45, T-51, and T-60 on the SBQ in the last week or so. Definitely increased the drop rate.
---
I know it isn't the exact topic, but I found 2 X01 jetpacks and 2 X01 calibrated shock mods at Modus the day mods broke. I don't know if they're related events but FML in the meantime because all I can do is look at them. Modus never had anything good before and it's the same crap since, but for that one day he was bringing out the good shit.
---
I assume they consider it PFC (Pay For Convenience) item. Neither kits can repair an item to 200%, the stronger version is obtainable through in-game events, and trying to use one in the middle of a PVP situation will most likely make you a sitting duck due to how long it takes to use it. 
---
I still think it's a freaking horrible idea. Guess at this point Bethesda *wants* the gaming community to hate them  with all the stuff they're doing to obliterate their PR.
---
They didn't listen.....so much stuff they could sell in the atom shop (weapon skins, armor paint, camp items, etc). Then they do this. C'mon Bethesda.
---
might be, at least it's a reason to go the park
---
people need to trigger it manualy for like 2300 caps.
---
" which I believe are able to be used more than once?-  "
---
You are kidding right?  "Each Improved Repair Kit you own can be used to buff one of the items in your inventory or Stash to 150% Condition. "
---
Thank you for keeping track of these issues.
---
Just saw another lost weapon post. The fun never ends.
---
You had a workshop.. the workshop initiates pvp.. how is this griefing again?
---
It’s still there. Just very expensive to do and people are lame and don’t help. 
---
Yesterday there was a level 84 and 112 just standing there, afk. So annoying.
---
If I buy one, what do I get for winning the game ?
---
going int the barrows, fighting the SBQ, in a solo, in any of the "dungeons" of that game and your good gun/armor break, boom because you paid you are back up without a care.
---
Those kits are for casuals real active players would have plenty to repair and plenty weapons to swap on the fly so trust me , don’t buy not even to try if trying to make a statement
---
I used to think it looked ridiculous and super nonfunctional to have BDSM strappy armor in a post apocalypse game. But it looks really, really good under some armor.
---
yeah i really dont get this.. are your atoms really worth those few minutes going to a camp and slapping 10 aluminium into your weapon?...
---
like if people want to be idiots let them be idiots and waste their caps..
---
Damn, I gotta go shop MODUS now heh.
---
I still don’t understand how it is legal to say there will be only cosmetic items and then LIE and put pay to win items...
---
I just did the event like 30 minutes before the maintenance.
---
Event doesn't get triggered by itself. Someone has to start it.
---
The game just runs like arse I'm afraid. Fallout 4 still runs like arse to this day without mods and unfortunately Fallout 76 runs on the same engine under more strain.
---
Oh man I can’t wait for the vending machines. I’ve got TONS of booze ready to sell at my bar.
---
Yeah gimme a damn leather duster Bethesda. And not some crappy one that goes down to the hips. We want dusters that go down to the feet dammit!
---
If your armor or weapons get damaged in PvP you'll be dead before you can click the menu to repair it anyway.  Relax.
---
The rare responder bot should work like Grahm, I've seen Grahm a bunch of times whilst I'm just wondering around and it always feels awesome. I've only seen the responder bot after server hopping for an hour and a half.
---
so.. how much will the repair kits be?
---
What is your opinion of a huge event?  Just curious.
---
I really liked the Fasnatch event, despite the awful drop rates.
---
Ii did the same thing.....but also bought the tuxedo set too
---
almost 1500 atoms gone
---
stupid game lag :(
---
Not had the issue personally, but fully support this!
---
I would not be mad at decorating my T-51b with some deathclaw accessories.  Yao-guai, scorchbeast and sheepsquatch options would be cool, too.  I'd probably opt for radscorpion decor, because I'd rather fight three deathclaws or scorchbeasts at once than one of those.  I charge straight at deathclaws, but radscorpions make me pause to think about what I'm about to do.
---
I was totally expecting some kind of nasty enemy in Uncanny Caverns the first time I went.  It was just standard mole miners.  The narrator talked up "Night Kid" quite a bit.  Maybe a future DLC.  He's gonna have to be some kind of extra extra wendigo or something.  Maybe a very high level Nightkin ala New Vegas.
---
I just did one this morning. 
---
People are doing it less often, which is to be expected.  Everyone pounces on new content at first, then gets bored with it.  So of course you're going to see fewer people doing the event as time goes on.  We've seen the same thing happen with nukes.
---
oh no, now someone isn't gonna have to walk 4 feet in any direction to find a workbench that is so very incredibly common
---
Charcoal I do believe is used to absorb toxins in the water that may not have been removed by other forms of filtration.
---
In some cases, if a child accidentally swallows a poisonous substance such as rat poison, one potential treatment is to make the drink charcoal mixed with water (this does depend on the type of substance that was ingested of course) as it absorbs the poison and prevents it from doing as much harm as it otherwise would have and also helps it pass through their system without their body absorbing it.

&gt;Harvest Moon

harvest moon with alien blaster
---
What’s this about a player only taking one pylon? Was there a glitch or are they making it so a single player can no longer activate all three?
---
Breaking news: Mr. Obvious says the obvious.
---
No one is worked up over it. It is posts like these that perpetuate the thinking that people are upset over it. And no, repair kits are a one time use.
---
Popping my head in here to let you know we're reading the feedback and the comments. Thanks for all the suggestions and ideas, guys!
---
I actually haven't seen the outfit you're talking about. I've only been able to complete the event once out of like 5 tries.
---
There’s nothing in the shop that anyone has to buy or that is really needed to play the game. 
---
Repair kits are overrated for most players anyways since most usually just fix their stuff as they always have.
---
ROFL, GOD DAMN DO I LOVE THIS SCHADENFREUDE, I remember not long ago you were arguing with me left and right that bethesda wouldn't be adding p2w items after calling out the slippery slope on the health boosting armors in the atom shop.
---
This is absolutely HILARIOUS I now get to watch you grovel and whine now that it is already done while people in the past tried to warn you and you kept arguing and claiming they were wrong.
---
WHO WAS WRONG NOW?!?
---
The improved ones will be earned in game. From what I remember, when they first announced repair kits, the basic ones can only be used once, but the improved can be used more than once. That's what I meant. I already know about you said
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76). If you'd like this bots functionality for yourself please ask the r/Layer7 devs.[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
I'm not trying to start an argument here, I'm just wanting a genuine conversation with somebody.
---
Could somebody please explain what the issue is with the repair kits and why it's such a "controversy" for Bethesda. Buy a basic single-use item to repair a weapon to 100%, or play the game to acquire a much better one. I dont see how repairing an item to just 100% condition is pay-to-win. What advantage exactly is it providing a person? Sure, they can repair an item one time without spending materials but I can't say I'm exactly junk poor. I'm swimming in the stuff. With my own perks I can repair an item well past 100% condition for relatively cheaply. 
---
Surely the sensible thing to do is to not buy them from the ATOM store. If they sell poorly, Bethesda would probably remove them from there. Speak with our wallets as it were. 
---
Again, I'm not trying to cause grief here I'm just trying to understand what the issue is exactly?
---
It is a user initiated event and costs 2000 caps to re-initiate. The first time is free for each player so naturally the frequency of the event will die off as less people will be completing the event for the first time. Nobody wants to pay 2k given the rewards
---
I havnt had any issues since I upgraded to an external solid state drive. 
---
It of course makes every game load faster - depending on how large a solid state you want.
---
Get a USB 3.0 enclosure (2.5 preferable, 3.5 will work) and a ssd. Fo76 is a little less than 60 gigs. I'd recommend a 120gb at least so u can do an extra game here as well, larger if you want a lot of games to run faster. 
---
1 minute load times with laggy 10-20 seconds when the game actually started turned I to 25 second load times with 1-2 seconds to immidiatly play with the entire environment loaded.
---
The problem is our system are still running archaic storage devices.
---
&gt; into either a 10 person (2x5) or 25 person (5x5) raid group.
---
Listen up young one, back in my days we raided with 40! *gavels down*
---
Nope. And it's a really tough fight so I wouldn't try starting it until you have a look at the map and hope theres some high level players that might join in or get a squad. Unfortunately it's almost impossible to do solo
---
Honestly I would be so much more ok with this if they just earnestly told us they ran the numbers and the atom shop income won’t be enough to keep things going so they’re experimenting with utility items. 
---
I played the hell out of Guild Wars 2. It’s a pay-once MMO with no monthly subscription but lots of utility and cosmetic micro transactions. I never had an issue with that because they were up front with it. 
---
If they need to do this to keep the game going then ok, but the way they’re handling it is not ideal. 
---
Honestly I think more quality cosmetics like the badass excavator paint and the upcoming horsemen of the apocalypse paints are the way to get more money. If I don’t have the atoms for those I will absolutely buy them and I doubt I’m alone.
---
Nothing you own should break in any of those fights imo.  I rarely repair my stuff as is.
---
First time people got to trigger it for free, now you have to (once used free one) buy a card from misc tab in vendors costing a base price of 2500 before charisma AND combine it with some flux.
---
\~2000 caps for a chance at a 1\* wooden leg ain't great odds. If she more consistently dropped 3\* loot more people may pay, also each event has a 3 hour cooldown per server.
---
Mutation itself is good even if you use energy weapons provided that you have rank 3 Class Freak but the thing is it does not work as intended. Even if you have maxed out class freak, it still reduces your dmg with energy weapons by 50% instead of 12%. Hope they'll fix it with today's update.
---
_Everyone hated that._
---
You're talking about the improved repair kit you get from the SBQ. Not the basic repair kit from the Atom Shop. 
---
But yes, I believe that even for the latter, this will be one use only.
---
Yesterday I was going to legendary farm and there was already someone there killing stuff. Fucking griefers man.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Yea I realise all, but really, I just hop to to my camp, do a 200% repair, and go back to where I came from
---
And yea, I always check if I have to repair first before I join SBQ (except once, where ofc it broke midfight, and I had to finish up the fight hitting her with my vamp ski sword p)
---
Maybe because I've been doing a Rifleman all the way since B.E.T.A., I've never needed to fix my weapons that urgently. The case might be different for those who use automatic and laser weapons, I guess.
---
I really don't understand why they are doing this, surely sales of these kits will be underwhelming. Fast travelling to CAMP or a station to repair is no big deal anyways. So much negative backlash for surely what will be a net loss when all is said and done.
---
Unless there is a stealth nerf to durability/repair costs in this patch...
---
Send a support ticket to Beth and they should refund your Atoms.  I've done an accidental Atom Shop purchase on two occasions and both times Beth refunded my Atoms after I sent a support ticket about my mistake.
---
They say how if we the community feel like they add a significant advantage and pose a real problem, they’ll fix it.
---
Nah dude people are definitely pissed. Already saw comments on posts about the patch notes, and a post from someone saying they're "done" cause of the kits, unfortunately
---
What should I include in the ticket? Should I just put my username or should I send proof?
---
They didn’t hear loud and clear. They heard the bitching players that want an easy game. Look at the feedback on the patch notes.
---
i dont care one way or the other, BUT they said atomic shop items were only going to be cosmetic, which repair kits are not cosmetic, this is just the start, whats next?
---
The improved ones are also single use
---
The literal ability to repair your item on the fly that no one else gets unless they pay money for.
---
You seem to be confusing p2w thinking it literally only is p2w if you can "win" the game. P2W by definition means "an item, boost, buff, or anything else you can purchase with real money in a game that will give you and advantage over players who haven't spent money in the game."
---
i would exploit that  extra point and build a dual build build lol they rather should make the quality of life perks passive and not actualy taking up any points to equip but only the point to craft the card
---
Yesterday I got my first explosive weapon: an black powder pistol. I am very disappointed
---
You should have seen the outrage when they announced repair kits, and it might get worse later lol
---
I believe 5/23 he comes out
---
May 23
---
How exactly would it be illegal? Did they sign any sort of contract or agreement saying only cosmetics?
---
So I picked up all six eggs but I can't find them in the build menu and I also can't find this bunny hat.  What gives?
---
"Improved Repair Kits are not available in the Atomic Shop. They are rare items you can earn by completing in-game content.
---
They are currently dropped as loot by the Scorchbeast Queen and may be added as rewards for other types of in-game content in the future."
---
Their notes make it sound like it is from the SBQ only.
---
&gt; Make it lore-friendly 
---
Postman outfit back on sale! 30% off!
---
Have you seen the comments on the patch notes? The kids even had to have a stocked thread for everyone and about them.
---
Then go fuck off and cry in a corner. NO ONE EVER WILL SAY, "OH MAN THAT GUY BEAT ME BECAUSE HE REPAIRED HIS GUN FOR ATOMS"
---
I actually think it's kinda cool. 
---
I don't know what everyone's getting so worked up about anyway. Because they all act like they hate PVP in this game. But then something like this comes out and they're like oh no it's pay to win.
---
Y'all don't even like PVP anyway. The only people that should be mad are the scorched and the super mutants.
---
But then should the game be made only accessible to hardcore players?
---
It is more them setting a precedent for the future by testing the waters with an item that impacts gameplay, even if only in a very small way.
---
Yeah radscorpion like carapace pieces on your armor would look badass - especially if you could work in like their claws somehow? I can handle scorpions and deathclaws but it's the yao guais that always make me question my life choices with that stagger?? Holy hell those guys destroy me. 
---
Right me too!! I was actually spooked - like scared to go in cause I found the wendigo tape outside and I was like omg a wendigo is gonna get me (because i'm a weenie and actually scared of them) and then the night kid was kind of spooky sounding and then it was.. just.. mire lurks. womp womp.
---
How much do RK's weigh WTF I've accepted that they are in the AS but if I can't drop or trade the ones I collect in game I need to know how much they weigh. WTF guess I'll find out tonight. 
---
Players who are not at work/school please let us know how much these things weigh if you can. Thanks
---
I did the same thing a few days ago! I was looking at what the Easter set has in it and accidentally bought it.
---
I could only see him not being an asshole if he came as them with some low level weapon as to not immediately destroy both of them. If he were to attack them with something extremely powerful then that's where I call it toxic. My team rpg's all the time. But we dont go after a level 40 that wants to contest our ammunition workshop.
---
It's all that extra elbow grease
---
I’ll miss you I’ll always remember that time you quit because of a item. farewell old friend stay strong.
---
all the DLC has had a fixed starting point, the camera will probably be the same just so everyone can get a camera to complete the daily challenges, it it's just random it could takes days or weeks for people to find one
---
Is this about them putting repair kits in the atom shop?
---
The kits being able to be used in the field is their entire point. Hopefully there's an animation (or some other means of adding a little downtime) when using them. Otherwise I could see them being problematic from a balance stand point.
---
What platform are you on? I’ve got the mod and don’t use the gauntlet. I was going to wait for player vending to sell it but if u give me the caps I’ll give you the mod.
---
I agree! I personally won't be using them or going out of my way to get them cause I don't personally have a use for them
---
Oh yeah I meant DCG
---
What?
---
I did read the patch notes. I literally said I read about this when they first announced repair kits
---
"Everybody hated that decision"
---
they're not. They're just twatwaffling.
---
I'm what most would consider a "whale" I've spent a few thousand on skins in LoL, and a few hundred on skins in PoE. I absolutely will never be spending a penny in the atom shop as long as the developers continue to show they have zero respect for the players.
---
When this game was announced I was excited, I loved bethesda back then and had played every fallout game from 3 onwards and the Elder scrolls series since daggerfall. I was EXCITED to be able to throw some money at them in a cosmetics shop like they said it was planning on being at the E3 announcements.
---
Now? I will NEVER spend a penny in this games atom shop, and unless they make some serious changes and own up to the scummy shit they are trying to pull I'll never give them another penny in this game or any future game of theirs. Definitely will go out of my way to AVOID all their future titles if this is how they fell about their fans.
---
There are other holotape games?! I need to go searching...
---
Yeah same. It was going well until the last day. I checked in multiple times but nothing appeared.
---
Big list, well done with all of the research and effort!
---
Same with the X01 as well
---
On PS4, I'll take all your stuff
---
😂
---
&gt;t45
---
and that's exactly the problem
---
give me famine or at the very least plague or give me death
---
The game is a money grab, though. Atomic Shop items are incredibly overpriced, and they have in the past used defective marketing to boost sales (is. Christmas Bundles being marked down from a price they had never been marked at). A lot of the junk in there seems haphazardly priced as well (icons). Not to mention the things that were free in Fallout 4.
---
Personally I don't see any problem with it cuz they kind of suck anyway. They only repair an item to 100%. The current method with the right perks can get it up to 200%. So if people want to piss money away or Adams I'm something like that more power to them. It's not like it gives them any sort of an advantage.
---
Inb4 did you just drop them
---
Anyone else nervous to see what you need to make the film with?
---
I don't know that I'll ever do that event again to see one. Does it have a pink belly, and puffy tail?
---
the Automatic grenade launcher heavy barrel still does not give a damage increase
---
Man I only got one :( gotta step my game up
---
Source? Not saying you’re wrong, not at all, but I’m curious to read that info.
---
If link gets a motorcycle in botw I want on in fo76
---
pay-for-convenience is not the same as pay-to-win.
---
Which group poses a bigger threat to the community, the ocean of people with Explosive/Bloodied weapons and Cavaliers/Sentinal suits bought online or someone who wants to repair their weapon mid silo? Both are paying to win
---
I agree completely! 
---
Ironically there are more high level players that never got a TSE weapon after fighting the SBQ or anything else but we see everything under the sun selling and people buying. 
---
Look at all the people wanting to buy unyielding it sentinel armor... or the TSE weapons... technically all those are paying to win in some fashion yet no one complains about that. 
---
(I’ll probably get down voted for the truth...lol)
---
People are mainly worries that it will be a slippery slope.  First they do the repair kits, then they add a refrigerator for our food, then a character respec, etc.
---
I am not a fan of them in the Atom shop but I understand that it is not P2W, just added utility like Beth states.
---
Does anyone know when the C.A.M.P. decoration with stash items feature is coming out (it’s the feature I want the most!)? I think LadyDevann mentioned something about it coming out in a later patch. Thanks!
---
You're fine! No worries, people are gonna get mad no matter what. I just don't think they realize no one is forcing them to buy the kit
---
I agree, but it's the start, people being ok with it, more and more stuff will be added later that will be good.
---
You do realize that those kits can be obtained by using atoms, a currency that you can get in the game for free, right?
---
buy a stealthboy
---
I get that and I agree with that sentiment, but as I said we all should "speak with our wallets". I would imagine if the repairs kits dont sell very well Bethesda will likely not do more things like it in the future.
---
More survivalist gear please, more military stuff please, more western stuff please, a bandolier and carry pouches. I will happily pay for those
---
You done fucked up
---
Filthy Casuals may be able to help
---
While people are pissed they’re definitely the vocal minority.
---
So, basic repair kits are in the atom shop.  So what?  I can repair my equipment at workbenches all across the wasteland.  I really don't see how the basic repair kits sold for atoms are "pay to win".  They offer little to no advantage.  They're barely even a minor convenience.  
---
The improved repair kits are available as special drops and quest rewards.  They simply duplicate the behavior of some perk cards, so even their utility is rather limited.  They're just a nifty little doodad to play with in game.  
---
I just don't get all the complaints.  In my mind, Bethesda is adding new features that mostly just provide in-game flavor.
---
"Learn to craft a ProSnap Deluxe Camera by finding a broken one on the corpse of a tourist who met their end in the Wasteland.
---
Once you’ve acquired a Camera, you’ll begin the new “Bucket List” quest, which allows you to finish the tourist’s photography collection, if you so desire."
---
They said they'd look into adding it to more in the future in the patch notes im pretty sure.
---

---
After reading the patch notes and hearing that you're going to get improved versions from high level bosses, this isn't a "pay-to-win" option. 
---
If I grind out the SQB (more reasons to drop nukes there) then I'll have tons of repair kits. that'll effectively keep my equipment going longer than a regular paid one. I actually don't see a problem with this. Play, get good gear, repeat.
---
It's the start of starting releasing more and more qol items in the atom shop. Beware of the future.
---
Because this proves they straight up lied about the atom shop being purely cosmetics.
---
Can I have your screws?
---
I don't think there is any setting currently in the game which is instance (one of the things that makes it frustrating, imo). Server-hoppers typically clean out plans and good loot before I can ever get there.
---
Yeah, I missed out on getting a hit on a bunch of enemies including the sheepsquatch in a sheepsquatch event because the game loaded me into the world but didnt show the enemies until a few minutes later. they could sure see me though.
---
I just want doors to work properly. I dont know how many times I've come to a closed door, try to open it and suddenly it jumps to the open position and closes and than I have to re open it. Its been like this since beta and I'm just noticing now that when it jumps to the open position what I can see through the door is definitely not what's on the other side when I open it properly, I've seen fields inside of buildings.
---
I can confirm exploding cryo does actually slow enemies (freeze), the exploding perk and dmg itself is basically removed other than the animation/range from what I can tell.
---
Fun Fact, I never have in the first place
---
And if you think not buying them will stop them from doing this again with different stuff ... we'll see in 3 months, when they offer up a Special Fusion Core that runs 10x as a normal one. For only 1000 atoms
---
Solid argument 😂
---
Personally, I'd much rather see more spontaneous/automatic grouping mechanics such as what the game already has with the events, where you can join or leave the situation whenever you like, aren't beholden to some group, and don't need to join a team beforehand to be able to partake in the activity. Since the framework is there, it can be improved upon, so that negative fringe cases, such as where people bum off of the work of others, can be minimized.
---
This would serve both people who love socializing with others and joining teams, by allowing them to do just that, but also people who come from a culture or background that isn't as socially driven but rather prizes solitude more, or are just built in such a way that they'd rather pop in and out of a situation rather than go through the whole process of taking a spot in some group and so on.
---
This is, after all, the Fallout franchise, which has, as we know, thus far been a single player game, so a lot of us Fallout fans are Fallout *single player* fans, and have merely been forced into a multiplayer experience. Which is fine, of course, but there *is* also a way of making that multiplayer experience work better for everyone, rather than trying to convert it into something like WoW, complete with dungeons and raids and large raid groups. I know people don't really want to use the term MMO to mean what it actually originally meant, but as far as its original meaning goes, Fallout 76 is not an MMO, so perhaps it might be better not to try and shove so many MMO ideas into it.
---
It looks like, from how I read it at least, one person could spam “become conduit” on a single pylon multiple times, which would increase the active pylon count, so you could make the squatch vulnerable with only one pylon activated three times.
---
White Knight/Pipe being nerfed and Not Fix It Could I guess.
---
It's going to be hard for them to balance literally any Weapon or Armor durability without people saying it was because of the Cash shop now.
---
Ill have a random (insert enemy here) come up to my CAMP. The turrets usually take care of them before I get out the door. But this is the first time my CAMP was Nuked.
---
I know, right? I had to wait like, 4 minutes for the guy to get off the vendor bot in Watoga. Greifers...
---
I don't like the idea of repair kits in the atomic shop. Not one bit. Then again, even if I play 30-40 hours per week and go through 10,000-20,000 .50 Cal rounds.. I swear i only repair once or twice on my weapon, and my power armor can go a month or more without needing repairs. When I do repair, the cost is extremely minimal.
---
The repair kits kind of baffle me because:
---
1. I'll definitely never need to use them. Not even remotely. I'll probably have stacks upon stacks of the Advanced Repair Kits because I nuke and kill SBQ a few times every day, and I only repair once or twice per week. I'll probably use them just to get them out of my inventory if they have weight.
---
2. Where I MIGHT actually like to use them is leveling an alt, but the advanced one's can't be traded. Feels pointless. I guess this is where they try to get me to buy basic repair kits with atoms but... nah, no thanks. I have 10K atoms combined between my 2 accounts and I don't even do daily / weekly challenges on purpose. I still won't spend them on that, rather save up for the next cool weapon / power armor skin that comes out.
---
3. For something that very few people will buy and will make BGS no money, they've caused a TON of ill will towards BGS. It's like they're selling their soul for a few measly dollars.
---
I give it a week
---
&gt; (ie. Christmas Bundles being marked down from a price they had never been marked at)
---
I almost forgot this. Downright scam tactics
---
But who are you paying to win against? And what are you winning in the end? That's what I don't understand.
---
Wtf
---
I foot what you did there
---
Yep can’t wait to find all their dumped inventories and lovely loot in the suitcases at train stations because repair kits were the final straw lol, can’t see it happening though sadly 😂😂😂
---
Theres about 5 of these already
---
They only repair to 100%
---
Meanwhile, in-game ones you can earn give you 150%.
---
There's already perks for armor and weaponry that give you 200%.
---
I'm honestly fucking *shocked* your camp got nuked in that spot, such a random location to nuke.
---
I mean I don't disagree about the "speak with our wallets" sentiment, but the fact that they've stated the Atomic Shop would be cosmetic only in the past only to go back on that statement is something they should be held to.
---
Yeah they work on enemies, but do not seem to against players or in pvp. It seems to just show the effect on them vs actually functioning.
---
That’s the reason I stopped doing it.  That and no one even worried about the pylons. It’s a shit show.
---
And you can get Atoms for cash. So, what's your point? Just because I can get some of this money for free, doesn't make it less predatory.
---
Depends how you earn that money. Working a 12 hour shift down a coal mine to buy a repair kit doesn't sound easy to me
---
What platform are you on?
---
Would regular fusion cores still remain unaffected?
---
Great word lmao 😂
---
Do repair kits weigh anything ? Only reason I ask is in case they don't work and we get stuck with a bunch of broken kits that weight 5 pounds each :)
---
People really are gonna complain about repair kits good grief.
---
Or Legendary Tokens when the new vendor is installed. They obviously didn’t hear anything the community stated.
---
Except the people using the free ones you get from the SBQ. Also if you need to repair on the fly your doing this game wrong.
---
I just don't see it. It's purely a quality of life enhancement for Adventure mode, full stop.
---
Yeah, seeing as how aluminum was a premium commodity in just about everything, and now they're giving us more! Love it.
---
They aren't going to be making money this way. This is doing the exact opposite of making them money. They are pushing away the people they should be trying to keep happy, the whales.
---
Blocker perk for yao-guai doesn't mitigate the stagger, but sure helps considerably on your health bar.  Serendipity is another great defensive perk worth looking into.  Both work with power armor, too.
---
i thinkyou could tap fast and get it to count as more than one pylon.
---
Repair kits are just too much overrated, they are pretty much useless, they are not worth it, just repair your stuff at workbench or don't. See you all after maintenance.
---
Said griefer would have to go into their inventory, select the repair kit, and then the item to be used. In the time they spend in their pipboy doing this, they'd get dropped.
---
Unsure, my friend. I am a little disappointed that they are tossing the basic kit in the shop, but from a business-needs-money stand point, I get it. It sucks, but I'm just gonna not buy it cause I don't personally need it
---
My thoughts exactly. I don't see how this can possibly be worth it for them.
---
Could sell ammo in 20 or 50 round bundles to help balance.
---
Or go back to camp and repair to 200%.
---
And springs
---
"YOU DEFIED US!  BURN EVERYTHING DOWN!"
---
Yeah, I can't imagine why they don't listen to you.
---
Posts like these are very common, and I made a similar one not long ago where I asked the community if Bethesda had ever commented - one way or another - about it. I upvote every one I see in the hopes they someday will.
---
If you want to amass enough wealth to trade your way into the nicer part of town - yup.
---
If you're on XBox, can I have your stuff?
---
Ha, some of these people, hilarious.
---
So it’s quite obvious people are not happy with repair kits. However, I’d like to play devils advocate a bit. 
---
Let’s use Fo4 as an example. People often claim how the DLC (which cost real money) was worth it as it added new content and areas and quests. But, let us not forget it added the robot building aspect to workshops. People who did not spend real money did not have an advantage of having robots patrol their base and harvest crops and such. 
---
Clearly then, those who bought the robot DLC had a gameplay advantage over someone who did not - the game is easier once you have robots patrolling your base.
---
Now with these repair kits, those who buy them with real money will have a gameplay advantage over those who do not - the game is easier once you no longer have to look for repairing materials or visit a crafting station. 
---
Ultimately how we, I do not think either of these offered a “competitive advantage” - let’s focus on 76. 76 is either competing from a PvP standpoint or PVE standpoint. As someone who switched to PvP primarily, I can confidently claim that the condition of my guns has yet to influence even one fight. These encounters are over far too quickly for the repair kits to be useful. As someone who played much PVE before survivor mode, I can also claim that the competitive advantage seems equivalent to the robot DLC in 4 - just makes the game a little easier. That squad of four level 250 players are still going to run the nuke silo and kill the queen in the time itll take most people to actually use the repair kit to fix their guns - I mean squads are killing the queen repeatedly in a single hour. 
---
So in conclusion, while these kits will make the base game a bit easier, I do not think they will any way close the competitive gap between top level pvp and PVe players and the rest of us. 
---
If gathering resources is too much trouble for you, then perhaps remember what’s one of the major appeals of playing this Gagne (exploding and scavenging resources).
---
This move has caused no ill will towards Bethesda, and I am actually looking forward to the camera stuff when I get off work later today. 
---
Ps - the slippery slope argument are simply that - a slippery slope. Wait til they start putting bloodied explosive 50 cals in the shop before we start a true revolt lol.
---
Lemme get some fusion cores on your way out?
---
There's a bunch of scenic overlook areas but it'll probably be at a touristy location like the whitesprings or the civil war museum
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll try that out!
---
Heh yeah, I only discovered all the plastic at the school late in the day.  So good.
---
Both should be event earned. My only big annoyance is that they said they wouldn’t put anything but cosmetics in the atoms shop and they obviously went back on their word. They got flack for it in the past and they are getting it again. I’m all for the atoms store. Just produce something that I actually want to buy. Not these goofy oversized heads and bugged camp skins.
---
If you have so little respect for yourself that you will continue to defend a multi million dollar company while they straight up lie to your face, that is on you. Most people do have enough self respect to call this out though.
---
Just because they are incompetent doesn't mean that it isn't a money grab.
---
the game? paying for a quick repair of armor/weapons in the "dungeons" or "raids" of the game gives you an advantage. p2w has never been solely a pvp term.
---
and they way they talk with "utility itemS" repair kits are only the beginning.
---
I lost my unyielding sent right arm yesterday :/
---
If you’re following all these small sub quest are from people involved with the sheepsquatch but none of them have seen him , they all got different fates lol
---
You looking for a calibrated shock?  I have one.  I'm on XBOX.
---
If you have so little respect for yourself that you will continue to defend a multimillion dollar company while they straight up lie to your face, that is on you. Most people do have enough self respect to call this out though.
---
Oh yeah me too. I won’t get upset at burning 2k on what sometimes looks like a terrible silent film.
---
I use the drill on players I down in pvp to give them a slow finisher.
---
Cool, il edit my reply 👍
---
Lol. How you earn real life money vs. choices on what you blow your money on is your own business. Bethesda clearly stated that this wouldn’t be a pay to win game.
---
At the end of the day, a job is a job. Some money comes easy and some doesn’t. It doesn’t give a company an excuse to remove their promise. All of the materials, aside from ballistic fiber is easy to get free. What you can’t farm, use in game currency to trade for it.
---
If you can get what you need on an atom store, what does that do for the in game economy that’s barely there as it is?
---
They also have a Discord
---
Maintenance usually lasts until it's over.  Then the servers will be back up.
---
Think about any building that's been abandoned for even 10 years. All that is left is brick and metal. At 25 years, full grown trees would be coming out of the living room. Every surface would be covered with rust, moss, layers of dirt, or vines. 
---
Without somewhat regular paint and maintenance, wood breaks down very fast. Storms do minor damage, but after a couple decades with no one coming by to repair, it will add up. 
---
After 25 years of no one doing anything, everything will look like complete trash.
---
It is a massive pvp advantage some teams only play pvp.
---
As a rough guess, sometime before next week, or when ready, whichever comes first
---
So much for listening to feedback.
---
Keep grubbing that money BES.
---
Yeah, who wants to listen to hundreds of people post the same post every day about how “it’s pay to win”, nobody does.
---
ho-ly shit this patch is bad
---
&gt;give me famine or at the very least plague or give me death
---
r/me_irl
---
Is it not a recognized bug at this point that armor is breaking twice as fast and food is spoiling twice as fast?  There have been a ton of posts about it, but doesnt seem like Bethesda has noted it?
---
Well.  Bye then.
---
I don’t buy atoms but this is the reason I’m quitting.... until I download the update then I’m back to the grind I’ll pretend my post history doesn’t exist
---
No this is an MMO, players are getting a direct competitive edge on other players
---
I don't it has anything to do with their effectness, abilities, cost etc. It's the fact that Bethesda explicitly said that it wouldn't bring P2W elements to the game, thus alienating the fans dedicated enough to persevere with the game.
---
I just want a extra loadout. Far too many times im running around with contractor or super duper simply because I forgot to switch my cards back out.
---
Search for "PS4 Remote Play" on your phone or tablet.  You sign in with your PSN and the app lets you control your PS4 over WiFi.  Basically streams the screen to your phone and has the controller overlaid on the screen.
---
My point is that everyone will have access to this item without using any money at all. How can something be pay to win if everyone can have it without paying?
---
Besides this item isn't even super good or anything. As long as you keep an eye on your equipment's condition you'll never need it. If people want to use money because they're extremely lazy that's ok with me.
---
"Oh we built up some credibility with our lies about listenting to feedback? yeah well...let's get rid of that and shove those repair kist up their a\*\*es! We want their money!"
---
\-Bethesda Austin CEO
---
Honestly, most fights in this game last a few seconds to a minute, tops. No way you could break a whole weapon in that time, unless you were stupid and unprepared. Using the time they were activating the kit you could kill them anyway.
---
I never talk only as needed lol
---
"we've heard your complaints about the pay to win repair kits, but we don't care."
---
Yeah you can get them down to about 1750. But then again would I rather pay money to lose a fight due to incompetence or rather run a silo to lose a fight due to incompetence.... it’s tough
---
&gt; Pip-Boy: Item stats now correctly remain visible when inspecting an item in the Pip-Boy.
---
Thank you.  Just...  thank you.
---
Shit was getting frustrating.
---
What I don't get is for stuff you purchased, they have a "details" button, but not for stuff you don't own that, more than likely, you wish to see the details of
---
Okay, again, I thought they could be used more than once. My bad. Relax
---
When repair kits make you uninstall a game yikes
---
"The more you know" 😂
---
You’re the type of person that doesn’t understand how the degradation of policies work. They won’t go back on their word directly, but just by adding things that “just make life easier” over time. This is only a starting point.
---
Seriously if you have and good stuff let me know
---
Yes right now is the argument they want to make as well. What happens when the accounting team comes back and says it isn't making as much money as they projected?
---
Maybe the development team then says, " We can fix that by 'balancing' in game repair cost." Basically making it more costly to repair in game to the point that others feel it is needed to pay a "minimal" fee to get their repairs done. 
---
Every little change leads us further down a slippery slope.
---
Amen. I had to have my discord's owner make me a totally seperate channel that I'm in charge of. I can't take it when I'm full on immersed with my buddy and someone who isn't even playing the game comes in "WHAT'S HAPPENING GUYZ? I'm at WORK haha what are you guys up to?" and that one guy who has discord on his phone and carries it with him to the store to get beer and we hear all the transactions jesus christ
---
Ya it's getting rough, especially because I haven't had enough money for a new tv, so I'm still using the old one I bought back in college 🤦 woulda sprung for something bigger if I'd known I'd still be stuck with the same one for most of a decade 🤣
---
I main on pc but have ps4 aswell, and this is what keeps me away from the ps4 version.
---
That sucks man.  I get a lot of 100% cores from Enclave and Cranberry Bog events.  With a high leveled helper your friend should have no trouble completing them!
---
We know. Every YouTuber on the planet has been bellowing it for the past several weeks.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA imagine thinking using an ingame currency you can earn to repair (which is easily done as well) is Pay To Win.
---
STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AS A GAMER.  I WILL NOT BE LOOKED AT AS A CUSTOMER.  I HAVE RIGHTS YOU KNOW.
---
Dude go make a stance about something that actually matters, like nuking the whales.
---
https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241?s=21
---
I get where you are coming from, however if you read their statement it’s clear they aren’t adding anything else. They need to get more money flowing from the game or the higher ups will cut funding. It’s not the devs, it’s the corporation. Happy cake day btw.
---
Ssshhhhh. Don't say anything against Bethesda or you'll be downvoted to hell. Pretend that repair kits are totally fine. Pretend that "no one will buy them anyway", pretend that Bethesda won't add more, actual p2w items in the future. Pretend everything is ok, everything is fine. Keep chanting that over and over till you actually start to believe that a corporation will definitely not try to ecploit you.
---
Say it louder to the people crying "pAy To WiN"
---
Wow... thanks
---
I’ll have to take a look. I’ve been doing a lot of in game testing of various things, it’d be nice to see under the hood to see what it “should” be
---
Yeah... We can read... We still dislike that.
---
Fuck repair kits. You literally had everyone here fucking rail against it and you still went through with it, you fucking pricks. Goddamn. You had one fucking job. Jesus christ.
---
Seems like the third person mode is not really other then a doll supperposed on the bottom left kinda like a puppet , so if you notice the real “crosshair” is that one dot or even the middle of the screen
---
But this bunny head isnt directly from the atom shop. Have you tried trading it, or is this just an automated response
---
I'm sure I can say on behalf of everyone here, we appreciate you informing us of your decision. May your future be long and prosperous, may your family and friends live in peace and tranquility. Farewell good friend
---
Based on micro transaction success in games from other titles, the wallet says people will pay to win. i.e. Boycotting won't work. 
---
I would agree this won't really pay to win, but people are worried it will become the next step.
---
Xbox, forgot To mention.
---
Yeah... no. You'd spend too much time in the Pipboy to use a basic repair kit to repair something to only 100% vs fast travelling to your camp for temporary safe refuge, equip some perks, and do a 200% repair for extra stats.
---
Cannot speak for everyone here, only for myself
---
Not upset ... but a bit disappointed
---
As for Bethestha not making money ... well maybe they shouldn't have released a half finished game? Maybe then the inital backlash wouldnt have happened?
---
And don't get me wrong, I love the shit out of this game. But this is a money grab, and nothing else. I said it in a different thread, why would I use a repair kit, when I can get my gear to 200%, and cheap with White Knight too. 
---
Ofc, yea, this all might change when/if the raids come, and they are actually long enough to break weapons midraid. But until then ...
---
I would point out your logic fallacy, but you did it for me.
---
Are you fucking serious?
---
that would so it would alt betwen a perk card pack and a perk card point every 5 levels talking an extra 100 levels to get the extra 10 points
---
Yeah. They simply took stuff from Fallout 4 and sold it to us.
---
Personally I have no issue with the repair kits. If you don't like it, don't buy it. What exactly is a person gaining here? It's repairing an item that they can do from the billion workbenches in the game. I don't plan to use my atom points for repair kits especially since anyone can easily repair their own equipment. The real issue would be if repair kits were added AND the deterioration of equipment was suddenly increased (even if you have equipment specific cards like White Knight and Gunsmith etc.). That would show that Bethesda was forcing players to use their atom points in the shop and that would be a problem. It hasn't happened so I'm not worried. I'd be more willing to get the pitchforks if Besthesda introduced equipment to the atom shop that directly effected the game like increased damage or health. Some of you might remember the Unstoppables week but the health bonus from the Unstoppables week was there specifically because they are Super Heroes. It was a celebration for having these super heroes in the game. Super Heroes are suppose to be that little bit stronger than normal people and this lasted for a week no more. You can still buy their costumes and you won't have any bonus. That situation was overblown just like this one.
---
This sounds fun! I'd be happy with more Nuka Cola flavors merchandise too.  Need Nuka-Cherry PA paint, t-shirt, posters... etc.  
---
I liked the graphic t-shirts from the Fo4 Creation Club too. They could just give us those.
---
Yeah I mean to be honest I don't actually have much of a problem with it, but I am worried of the potential for it to lead to problematic decisions later. For now though I'm not about to jump ship or anything over it. The game is still fun and this doesn't impact me as far as I can tell.
---
As well as making pvp servers a bit less desirable. Even the earned ones, I agree should have either a 5 second animation or require something that makes it improbable to just hot key it and keep going.
---
There’s so many other things that they could be focusing on and this... idiotic patch is beyond not being worth the time. They should be adding more to the last several “DLCs” that they put in the game that has a whole five minute quest line.
---
Can't wait for the inevitable weapon loot boxes or perk boxes. What a time to be a fallout fan.
---
Armour is not breaking twice as fast.
---
 I bet 99% of people saying repair kits are PTW have bought weapons and armor with real money or caps, that is pay to win, you bought something you didn't earn.
---
Why not? 
---
You gonna open your pip boy, repair some armour you forgot to repair and still survive a PvP fight? 
---
I think not.
---
Watch our pvp streams on twitch mate. Some teams never let u off and it can last hours. We have some great battles. Of one team doesn't need to worry about workbench repairs then they have a massive advantage. 
---
The argument about them in game is lost on me as putting them on the queen and at 150% is a way to make the ones sold look acceptable
---
Just. Don’t. Buy. Them.
---
It’s as easy as that.
---
It’s not like it’s going to help that much. Really for casuals not wanting to worry about weapon degradation and just exploring and having fun. In a combat situation it’s not very useful and you could be killed going into the pip boy and using it
---
Awesome, repair kits are in and not a word about the couple hundred unobtainable atom from last week.
---
I am not able to use my PC right now. Has grounded mutation been fixed?
---
If an object provides 1 of 2 players an ability to restore functionality of a broken weapon without having to leave a fight while the other person cannot because they don't have a repair kit during the fight, THAT IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.
---
This is by far the dumbest move they could have made: completely ignoring the fact that they promised it would be “cosmetic only” not “offer a competitive advantage”
---
1. Reviewers and you tubers will have a field day with this, reverting any hopes of players possibly returning to this game after the conclusion of wild Appalachia
---
2. NO ONE IS GOING TO BUY THESE IF I CAN GET AN IMPROVED ONE FOR FREE! YOUD MAKE 100x more WITH A HANDMADE SKIN YOU HALF BROKEN TOASTERS, ITS NOT WORTH THE THRASHING YOURE GONNA GET FROM YOUTUBERs
---
Vote with your wallets.  i will not be buying repair kits from the atom shop.
---
Bye bye 🖕
---
If you opt to run a low health build, serendipity, blocker, lone wanderer and nerd rage basically make you unkillable when coupled with an emergency protocols torso on a suit of power armor.  Even without power armor, the bolstering and/or sentinel effect on good legendary armor basically does the same thing but better in PVP.  It's completely OP.  If you're unkillable in PVP, PVE has a snowball's chance in hell at hurting you.
---
They cost Bethesda soul and Todd Howard's integrity.
---
Devils advocate: What about players like me that haven’t touched their Atoms they’ve accumulated since the beta because they don’t care about skins and stuff. Shouldn’t we get something we want and can use in game?
---
Hahahahaha, you had me for a second.
---
You're ok with a loading what?
---
- ssd gang
---
Yes, insult people that are upset that Bethesda went back on their words. That will win them over!
---
We gotta nuke something, right?
---
Hear hear!
---
It is an Atomic Shop item. 6 eggs from the shop to get it. And it has the atomic logo beside it 👍
---
I think for survival they should be banned
---
I think people just like to feel enraged about things. Does it really matter that some kid spent actual cash money to fix his item out in the field while I have to find a workbench? That doesn't take away from my experience in the least bit. Maybe if you're one of the highest level players out there farming legendaries all day, and have to compete with other high level players doing the same .. and they don't have to travel somewhere to fix their stuff .. then maybe there's a valid concern. I just think the average player doesn't care about this at all. 
---
Now if they sold a weapon that's unbreakable or never ran out of ammo or is more powerful than anything that can be crafted or looted, then maybe that would be an issue.
---
If we spam this sub with repeat posts, this time, Bethesda will listen
---
Yeah but AFAIK there's never been anything in fallout that's sold for less than 1 cap. That's why I said there would probably have to be bulk ammo available so we can sell that.
---
You mean the legendary tokens we can buy when the new vendor is introduced
---
Ah yes, justifying microtransactions which affect gameplay by claiming they don’t affect competitive gameplay. Cant wait for this foot in the door to become “we added higher damage guns to the atom shop, but don’t worry because they can also be found with a 0.01% chance as SBQ loot, so you’re not really at a disadvantage”
---
Same!! The patch today, I'm hyped for the camera. I've always had a love for photography, so being able to craft a camera and lenses makes me so excited haha. There's so much to look forward to, as you said. Basic repair kit in atomic shop isn't remotely bad, it sucks a bit cause I would also prefer if they kept cosmetic stuff in the shop only, but I'm not raging over it. I'm just not gonna buy it and look forward to all the other cool stuff we have coming!
---
Great! Honestly you are very brave and it is about time someone stood up and told Bethesda how it should be. I am shocked nobody else has posted anything like this already. Bravo you're a fucking hero
---
So what? Just because it isn't "that good" doesn't make it ok to add it to the game. What will you say wheb tomorrow they add the fridge to the atom shop? "It isn't that good, you should just eat all your food before it spoils anyway", you'll say. They add ammo converters: "ok it isn't that good, you can craft ammo anyway"? Where is the line?
---
I think part of that may be relative to range (and) if you are in full auto, the longer you fire, the "larger" the crosshairs get.    Firing in short bursts helps with that a lot.
---
Shows what I know.  I’m sure you’ll find them on reddit for 50k lol.
---
it's on sale right now so maybe I'll buy it .... did they do any cool updates like No Man's Sky did to improve the game? Or does it still suck?
---
its not p2w its "utility items" just like how the game isnt online only it is a "live service" and microtransactions are just "recurrent user spending"
---
They are trying to shift the PR view.
---
People are mad for a good reason. While the repair kits are single use they are the first, massive step down a rabbit hole you guys do not want to be in.
---
Sure you can get them from the SBQ, but who even does that anymore?
---
What happens when they increase the cost of repairs to make the repair kits in the Atom shop more viable?
---
Or are we just going to sit blinding and just excuse horrible game implementations for the 1/2 bugs they fixed in the massive sea of bugs?
---
&gt; Basic Repair Kits are unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms
---
You greedy fucking gremlins.
---
Not for another hundred years, I think.
---
I can see myself buying 5 of those items or grinding the atoms for it
---
Ikr
---
Can we get this to the top in stead of 50 topics all complaining about repair kits? This is some high quality shit.
---
Picture this: you are fighting someone. We can all agree most people have really good weapons and are over level 100. In survival, which is really where most pvp happens, then how long would it take to open pipboy, scroll to weapon, use repair kit , then leave. 20 seconds at least. You would be dead by then.
---
It was a tweet.
---
If you think all tweets are promises, we'd have a war with N. Korea and a fucking border wall.
---
Shut up
---
There's the door. Feel free to play something else. The community appreciates you purchasing the game.
---
Repairs cost junk. Money can be used to remove the need to spend time to acquire said junk. As well as the time to travel to a workbench.
---
It's not a huge deal, but this is an example.
---
I changed the comment approval to Yes on my video. I approved all of yalls comments.
---
Lollll
---
As addressed in my post, I am not concerned about the current advantage. I'm concerned that if the consumer community allows this, what else will be added?
---
See what? That was my question. How is this comment helpful?
---
Slippery slopes not withstanding, I agree. This is a useful implementation of a utility item. If they were selling exclusive guns or armor, it would be a different story and who knows, that might be their goal and this is a foot in the door. I just don't see how going nuclear about it solves for anything down the road. Best to remain objective if we as a community want to gain/retain any equity with the developer.
---
I don't always watch news so I don't know.
---
So?  PvE exists.
---
Translation: 
---
“We saw your advice, and disagree. Fuck you.”
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
uhh what just happened
---
Here's a comment I can get behind! Dude I've been saving so many t-60 mods just for this patch!
---
I have an explosive 50 caliber machine gun and a plasma Gatling gun. They chew through the ammo. My handmade doesn’t get the love it should either.
---
My camp is up in the hills south of Watoga, so when a Nuke is launched at fissure site (which is fairly often) I can see it in all its beauty. I also see when the scorch beast queen spawns.
---
I am forced to play with other players that pay for this advantage. I am forced to used the 'Gunsmith' perk because the weapon degradation system has been inflated and is flawed. Weapon repair kits can be bought for money because their weapon degradation system is now a monetized tool, not a gameplay feature. 
---
It just feels slimy as shit when you truly break it down.
---
Yes, they said this, actually:  
---

---
Haha. 🤣
---
"We thought long and hard about your feedback... But then we thought about the money and got long and hard."
---
" A Note on Utility Items in the Atomic Shop:"  
---
TL:DR is "Screw off we need money, quit asking questions we are doing it."
---
I actually wouldn't mind if this type of RPing was how most people went about taking workshops, instead of just one shotting you anywhere on the map for no reason when they don't even want the workshop or its resources. I would have gladly given him the lead, and hope he still didn't kill me after the exchange.
---
RIPPER GANG
---
The Drill already works on CAMP items, but not as you are suggesting, it seems to get a damage bonus on Camps and wrecks walls or other things very quickly.
---
Hope you ditched everything you had in your inventory and stash before you left
---
Then don't talk, if you're not going to take the time to provide links to thinks that are pretty finite when you say them. 
---
Nothing else you said is worth reading in the text wall.
---
I sorta agree. The 1-2-1 crits with crit savy needs to be nerfed for full auto weps, or full auto-weps shouldn’t do as much dmg with a crit
---
It's not as though getting materials to repair your armour/weapons is hard to get. I have to keep selling all my crap, I pick up so much of it
---
Advantage may be a convenience but not all conveniences provide a notable advantage. Or even any advantage from a competitive standpoint
---
I didn't know that. I haven't seen the roadmap. Lol
---
I see where you're going with this, but they also put the improved repair kit to be earned in game. Which is also single use, but it repairs your weapon to 150% instead of 100% with the basic kit. So I don't understand why people are getting worked up, and yes I agree "pay to win" is too strong to use here
---
thank you!!
---
&gt; ‘if these are shown to give an advantage, we will adjust'
---
Tranlastion:  If you keep bitching about them and nobody buys them from the shop, we might have to rethink our plans.
---
Me too, waiting a log time to put the reactive plates on my X01
---
When that happens we can talk about it. No use talking about stuff that didn't happen. If they ever put stuff in the atom shop that is really p2w, then it's p2w and that's it, but those repair kits?
---
And they said this in the patch notes:  If we find that Repair Kits do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that advantage is removed.
---
I understand being worried about future items, but I don't see a reason to call this thing p2w right now.
---
Ok, I should’ve have insulted everyone badly, but still you can’t act like it’s such a huge deal people quit the game in rage.
---
Um... ok cool I guess?
---
This guy, literally lmao. Fucking smartass!
---
Were having a firefight, this fight goes on for quite a while because in some miraculous turn of events neither of us are using these OP god builds, my TSE minigun breaks, you think "brilliant, nows my time to go in for the attack"  
---
But oh no wait, I paid money for a repair kit from the atom shop and my TSE minigun is back up and running again to brun through another few thousand rounds towards you.  
---
In the end you give up trying to take this workshop or win this fight because your weapons have broken and you didnt buy any repair kits from the shop cus you thought CAMP items ewere a better choice for your hard earn't atoms, I win because I have real life money to throw at it
---
They don’t even repair past 100%, it’s more like pay to be mediocre
---
Lol
---
It's nice to see you and everyone else telling me and everyone who uses this sub something we already know. Thank you for sharing
---
So you don't go into fights unprepared. You spend the time to keep your weapons topped up. Someone who does not could gain the same advantage as you by paying money, whoch isbthe literal definition of P2W.
---
I'm buying the pack of 5000 Atoms and spending every single one of them on Repair Kits immediately.  Then I'm going to start a fundraiser on Facebook to help me buy more Atoms and more Repair Kits.  Soon I will be the strongest player in the game on all platforms.  I will win so hard that my character travels through time into Fallout 5 and I will bring back screenshots for everyone (as well as a bug report so Bethesda can fix them before they happen).
---
No problem my dude!
---
Well time to take a break from 76 until they rem9ve the repair kits from the atomic shop.
---
Btw Bethesda, be ready to be crucified in every gaming-related subreddit and youtube.
---
I dont know if this is known but on xbox1 when firing the Gatling plasma dosnt show the proyectile.
---
Man I miss morality
---
I know how that feels. Server hopped at least 40 times for both uncanny caverns and radscorpions
---
Omg upvotes all around.   Zomg repair kits and bug fixes!
---
I've got lots of ideas that could help to flesh out the bones of this game, with the combat system needing a considerable amount of work for re-balancing. I like discussing this stuff as well.
---
You want to tell Bethesda that you don’t want repair kits? Don’t buy them. It’s not about being poor. I’m just saying that the best way to tell them that nobody wants repair kits is to not give them your money. Bethesda’s more likely to remove them if there is enough backlash and not enough sales.
---
Experience boosts for Atoms will be next.
---
I like getting stuff as I progress. Though I’m getting close to the end now I think. Inhabit of a hoarder though which keeps my stash too full.
---
They promised COSMETIC ONLY:  
---
Wish I could upvote you more than once.  This pay for convenience move I guess is pretty tame, but honestly how much money can they hope to make to offset the ire of the community.  A really nice set of cosmetics on the shop would generate more revenue and goodwill.
---
I’m honestly surprised that someone hasn’t made a map listing all the armor and weapon workbench spots.  They are all over the place, and I can’t imagine anyone ever shelling out atoms for a kit.
---
You're not "forced" to use gunsmith or anything. The basic repair kit can be bought in the atomic shop, the improved repair kit- which repairs to 150% instead of 100%- is earned in game. Nothing slimy about it
---
This is how I see it: if I go anywhere with near-broken gear without the expectation that I am heading into a battle, I suspect I’m also probably stupid enough to spend real money on repairing my gear. Ergo, only stupid people (who deserve to lose their money) will be buying repair kits. 
---
If this game ends up funded by total idiots, I really don’t care. Why should you care how they spend their dollars when it doesn’t affect you.
---
This kind of thinking is dangerous. Think of the potential future if people don't make a stink about this. 
---
They'll think it's okay and then start slowly selling more and more critical items through the atom shop.
---
It’s not - as stated in my first post I have never encountered a PvP experience where I needed to use a repair kit. They are simply “oh I see someone” bang bang someone’s dead. I don’t think I’ve ever even had a gun deteriorate below 100 during any of my kill steaks in survivor, some lasting several hours w 10 plus kills
---
"We've listened to your input and ignored literally all of it because money"
---
I logged in just for that tuxedo bundle
---
I can smell you from here 🤮
---
Awesome 😎
---
So till then we are gonna pretend everything is fine and not talk about it?
---
I disagree. That's a direct competitive advantage.
---
It seems you are completely missing the point.
---
People are pissed because bethesda straight up lied to them to their faces. People aren't happy about that, the fact it is only a minor advantage doesn't change the fact it goes against what Pete Hines said, that the ATOM shop would be only cosmetics and nothing that effected in game mechanics.
---
This is just a continuation of the slippery slope they are sliding down. This started with the 60+Hp you could get with the bought outfits in the shop. Now it is repairs on the fly, next it is going to be refrigerators and being able to send gear to your stash without going to your stash, both of those they already mentioned.
---
So let me ask YOU, how much of an advantage does it have to offer before you accept that it is pay 2 win?
---
Yay, social tab is fixed &lt;3
---
It’s not true, but just use the same logic. They are available in game but why spend time farming and scrapping legendary items. Plus, it’s just a chance to reroll a weapon, so it really isn’t strictly play to win. You can see the slippery slope
---
It's best to go there for now, as this sub is about to be bombarded by posts about Repair Kits.
---
Don't forget Lt. What's-his-nuts note from the Ash Heap! Is weighs a quarter pound?! It's half a torn piece of paper!!
---
This made me Chuckle. Clearly, not caring about repair kits is a self esteem issue. I feel so dirty and used because I honestly don't give a rats a$$ about some useless item. It's an item for suckers to buy because a bunch of gaming crybabies have their panties in a bunch because Bethesda did a thing, so now the suckers actually think it's useful and will buy it. Nobody cares. Play the game or don't, but the hyperbolic drama BS is just ridiculous. Gamers on forums are the most ludicrous drama queens in the world.
---
But but you can buy something half as effective as weapon artisan...
---
That's what is wonderful about the internet.  Once it's said, good luck trying to cover it up.
---
Because they said no "p2w" items (and Repair kits are not a big deal tbh) but it can open a new door for them to introduce more items that can affect even more the gameplay. That's my fear.
---
Sign me up too. If you have anything good for a stealth sniper I'll gladly take it off your hands before you uninstall.
---
Love it.  Note: give me your legacy explosive energy weapons and I promise to never buy a single repair kit.
---
This needs more upvotes! My build mainly relies on Heavy Energy weapons and I hate seeing my fully charged fusion/plasma core get devoured after firing once
---
Or Deathclaw promontory from FONV!
---
I like the sense of humour and you clearly see the problem. I hope we have your true support.
---
Yep!
---
if 12 of you couldn't take someone stealthboyed your a terrible player
---
ah the good old slippery slope fallacy
---
I have repaired my armor once in 60 hours.
---
Hey guys hook me up with any unyielding/cavalier armours and or bloodied/SS weapons on PC :)
---
The servers only handle around 25 people at any given time, anyway.
---
exactly this!. not a fan of goofy cosmetics. they need to balance it out.
---
slippery slope fallacy
---
I imagine we can get them dropped from other events besides a SBQ fight. Again, not seeing the problem, considering the better repair kit is earned in game
---
I know. Just keep your cool, hurts the credibility of the argument.
---
We're all just trying to enjoy the same wonderfully flawed game at the end of the day. People worry about the future of the thing they like.
---
Wow it's like you didn't even read the rest of the patch:
---
&gt;**Improved Repair Kits:** New single-use consumables that can be used to buff one item to 150% Condition without using any crafting materials. **These are rare items that can be earned by completing some types of in-game content.**
---
No. That's not how p2w is defined.
---
That was a decision of the subreddit mods, not the community.
---
It was one of the early suggestion before the 200% repair option (it was bugged), people wanted to repair items on the fly without a workbench.
---
Just because 100 people are mad, doesn’t mean we should have 100 posts. They need a rant thread so all those dudes who want to read complaints all day can, and people like me who want to see stuff about the game (hence the title of the sub) can actually see content.
---
Mods should ban repair kit posts asap.
---
Dude I live in the mire and its great, very isolated.
---
They posted it in their message  
---
&gt;The Atomic Shop was founded to give you as much choice and variety in how you want to customize and celebrate your adventures. **It doesn’t offer anything with a competitive advantage**, and more so, it aims to bring joy not just to you, but the other dwellers around you.
---
Oh boy, you're about to be mildy annoyed...
---
It has always worked with weapons and armour.
---
The eggs are under floor decor scroll on the deathclaw statue, the bunny hat is secretly unlocked in the armors workbench you have to craft it! It’s cheap! Hope this helps!
---
Bethesda as a whole is already getting crucified for repair kits, if they released anymore P2W items they would be torched to ground by the consumers
---
The patch notes already said they can't be traded, crafted, or dropped, and they are one use only. Literally you can only buy them with atoms, there is no other way to get the normal repair kits outside of using the paid currency.
---
Repair on the go.
---
I have a two shot exploding laser pistol that does insane damage
---
But it breaks really fast like after 6 or 7 reloads. I could easily kill the impostor sheepsquatch if it didn't break so fast.
---
With the repair kits i could easily kill the impostor alone.
---
I not gonna buy them though, it would be stupid to waste atoms i earned on one time use items like that.
---
But this is not critical in any way.  Its a relatively useless product.
---
As someone that does not own this game, I lurk this sub to see if any sweet updates come out that might make me want to buy it.  
---
I see updates like this and it does exactly the opposite.
---
😂😂 of all the things to complain about repay kits is why they leave
---
Bethesda isn’t gonna have a lot of a Reddit community if they’re being hit with feedback about repair kits 24/7. they’ll do something eventually
---
If you couldn't detect the sarcasm in that sentence. I dont know what to tell you. Even the ones found in game are still 3/4 as good as weapon artisan.
---
Yeah theres no way in game events would ever be triggered through the atomic store. If they did that, it’d open the way to pay-to-participate events.
---
Auto closing doors in CAMP would be nice, no telling how many times Ive returned to my camp to have people waiting in side because, either myself or a friend didnt close the doors. In adventure mode its not so bad, but ive had experiances in survival where I returned to my camp only to get killed by someone  inside, because they were just lurking around.
---
Do you also miss melodramatic hyperbole?
---
&gt;that the slippery slope towards full Pay2Win is a go
---
pay2win from a  repair kit in a fucking co op pve shooter? 
---
explain to me how do i "win" in fo76?
---
I AM OUTRAGED BY EVERYONE'S OUTRAGE
---
The first time I saw perk card packs, I IMMEDIATELY thought "oh fuck, this is going pay to win". I have to wonder if they only backed down on that because of the EA microtransaction debacle that happened just before FO76 release scared them from doing it. If so... thank god.
---
That sounds rad! Wish I had that outfit!
---
Just luck I guess you’ll find a good un soon! Or be the good person!
---
Baseless is definitely not the correct term
---
Right now to the best of my knowledge with in itself is finite, it only drops from the SBQ right now.
---
The problem I see is the future .. not the present. Bethesda does not have a good track record when it comes to things like this.
---
I mean sure .. will I keep my fingers crossed they won't keep being greedy. But I'm not going to hold my breath in the hopes it happens and will keep my outlook the same.
---
It's all about pvp and gun breaking mid battle. It only happens to teams then spend a few hours a night playing pvp. Your gun breaks mid fight , u van switch to secondary or escape and find a word bench. Or, now, u can quick select a repair kit and finish them off
---
Only dropped rarely by the SBQ, according to the patch notes.
---
I love how their excuse is the atom shop isn't "cosmetic only" but things that won't give you a "competitive advantage". WAAAAY looser definition on that so I'm not surprised. According to them, the kits aren't "competitive advantage" but a "convenience". Also they're going to keep stressing that you can earn atoms instead of buying them. This is the new norm, folks.
---
Recent times? I come across far less assholes now than I did in the beggening.
---
Yeah I'd love to. I'll add you and if I see you on I'll shoot you a message sometime.   And I'd ask the same of you if you're interested.  I set up a bar/restaurant/store so any suggestions you have would be more than helpful.   Plus I can serve ya up some chilled nukashine....well maybe just regular nukashine but whatever.
---
Hahaha for real , but then again one of the guys killed the other guy cannibalism apparently , and then Mari went and killed them both and turned ...
---
it was a thing from the beginning
---
If the DLC was proper content I'd happily pay for it!
---
I bought Every DLC for the previous Fallout games and those contained much more than this shit!
---
I've officially lost faith in you, and in this game. Repair kits do not belong in the atom shop, this is a directly purchasable advantage.
---
Thanks for the shout out, I'll edit my post and reference you!
---
If the community wanted to make a statement about the repair kits, you should've done it weeks ago when they first got announced.
---
Instead, you all cried for roughly 24 hours until forgetting about it and gushing over the next update. And now you're asking why bethesda ignored all the backlash?
---
Because 24 hours of backlash means literally nothing.
---
If they didn't give away nearly as many free atoms as they do I could maybe slightly think it's tangential to p2w but as it stands it's little more than a novelty or a laziness tax
---
You have a point, not going to lie
---
Same for me. I’ve tried moving the actual C.A.M.P thing as suggested here and it works for one or two loads then it just spawns me back in the water
---
Yes person x needs to grind for an hour going to point to point to point for screws and gears to repair armor and weapons because they also nerfed the auto repair perks  
---
Person y uses mom's credit-card to just repair everything and continue to troll on survival servers with no recourse other than mom not affording chocolate milk
---
Not really sure why you like being turned into a milked cow instead of owning things you buy and being treated like a customer....but I guess consumer-serfs are becoming the new normal.
---
dont worry , they will nerf your 200% perks soon
---
so heckin livid
---
I'd say being able to save your mats like Ballistic Fibers  instead of spending them to repair would certainly be an advantage, especially in mid level.
---
I retract my statement
---
I was really into the game despite the bugs
---
 Was even trying to rum a shop but this is one bug I can't dismiss.
---
What uncommon materials are you struggling with? I can point you in the direction of some resource nodes.
---
yes bloodied explosive handmades are totally coming to the atom shop for 6000 atoms next patch /s
---
Bethesda’s website that is lol
---
I play loooooong 6-8 hour sessions and I only find myself repairing every couple of days.  Don't understand why there is such an uproar over this.  I have perks that take care of all of this.  Don't see myself ever getting these because they're simply not needed.  Better ones drop off SBQ?  Okay great... still probably wont even use them.
---
Or what will happen exactly? Are you going to stop playing?
---
Who cares?
---
It's all feels here lately....
---
That is *literally* how pay2win is defined.
---
My pc takes a lot of time after the initial loading, after that the games runs smoothly
---
I have accepted a reality wherein every facet of our lives is controlled by billionaires and their machinations, and micro transactions within video games that only some 15% of the planet can even afford to play being a meaningless hill to die on. 
---
I also think whether or not they lied to our faces is up for interpretation and am not defending the decision to do so. I just think that if we want to pretend we have the means to hold them accountable (we do to some extent) complaining about minor to non-existent issues isn't how we go about doing so. 
---
I'm simply trying to keep some perspective on the change.
---
Just like the red star on the normal Liberators!
---
Hey its me ur brother
---
Re-read my post, pay special attention to the part with "future" in it.
---
Yes this is seemingly useless, but it is a new precedent. What other new precedents could be set in the future if they think this is okay?
---
It's obvious they are doing it to put a foot in the door to selling things that give advantages down the line. When all the loyal people have left and it's nothing but l337 haxxors jumping around killing each other
---
You seem to be missing the point that they can be used on the fly, weapon artisan can't.
---
Yeah ok... 
---
Convenience - the state of being able to proceed with something without difficulty.
---
Advantage - something that places one in an improved position.
---
Repair kits fall under both,, but by all means follow bethesdas narrative.
---
SO heckin livid. repair kit. pay to win. bethesda bad
---
It's bigger than people realise because they don't commit to pvp all the time.
---
right!?!
---
But everything is fine right now. Repair kits are far from being necessary and they're obtained in game.
---
Talking about this is the right thing to do, but this topic is about a guy that's going to stop playing the game because of this. Im my opinion this is overreacting.
---
Being worried about future decisions is ok, but going around saying the game became p2w because of this specific item is just lying or not understanding the game.
---
personally I'm not, I'm just remembering situations where people complained they wanted repair kits so they wouldn't need to find shit
---
The issue is "gamer speculation", that is it. A certain subset of gamers believe that this is some nefarious pilot project, that will result in FO76 becoming "pay to win". That's it. No basis in fact. Just a wish that somehow, a game like this can survive without no further revenue generation beyond initial game purchase price.
---
fallacy? Have mtx been getting magically better in games and i've totally been missing it?
---
Cause I don't think it's a fallacy at all.
---
Well, they can only be used to repair. So if you're not using them to repair, you're just saving them. Do you get what I'm saying?
---
I'm not *defending* repair kits, I'm just ironing out Beth's bullshit logic as to what constitutes an "advantage".
---
😭😭😭😭
---
There is a children's book that goes well with what Bethesda is trying.  If You Give a Mouse a Cookie
---
As soon as I read this, I kind of wanted to be able to snipe the weapon and activate the rocket, causing someone to go spinning around Oblivion model style...
---
repair kits are a slippery slope to full p2w
---
All we need is a chucky mask.
---
I would appreciate an "are you sure" option as well.
---
I only mentioned that knowing they also said they wouldn’t offer items and now they do. More players overall must have wanted them then. 
---
Again not me, not sure why they’re really needed anyways so it has to be the demand for them.
---
I’ve got 3 of the unyielding combat armor with a bloodied handmade, and my TSE handmade perk setups for both,just put my camp paint on the armor and I’m John cena 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
IT'S DADDY DRILL TO YOU, YOU UNCULTURED SWINE
---
Lazy bums.
---
If you use a dragon with any regularity you know how fast they break (even with perks) so having any means to repair them on the fly can be a tremendous advantage.
---
How this factors into p2w is simply because you can use real world money to purchase this advantage. Sure you can earn atoms and kill the queen to get some, but someone with money to spare can easily dump their cash into those and never have to grind for materials to maintain their weapons like the rest of us have been doing for months.
---
The tremendous p2w sensitivity I think largely comes from the promise of atomic shop items being cosmetic only.
---
Also red17474 on Xbox is looking for help if you are quitting on xbox
---
Items sold from other players end up in a vendors inventory for a short period of time
---
Yea the sheer flood of videos is gonna make youtubes suggestions unwatchable for a while
---
And it will make convincing new players to join so much harder ... again ...
---
Like this. I'd love to be able to have perk card sets, like a PA set and non-PA set.
---
&gt; Which group poses a bigger threat to the community, the ocean of people with Explosive/Bloodied weapons and Cavaliers/Sentinal suits bought online or someone who wants to repair their weapon mid silo? Both are paying to win
---
Bethesda didnt provide these as a commodity though, they have on the other hand now provided something P2W
---
you had a 400IQ idea ngl
---
Because the mods of this subreddit were deleting all posts about it after 24 hours.
---
Anything that will give you another option. Not just press one button and you’ve already bought it.
---
Except it's not a quick select item. You must still inspect and repair a weapon exactly the same as on a workbench. It's not feasible to do on the fly while in a fight.
---
We should probably lower the stash size now that everyone can buy calibrated stock things and the cool bone skin for the excavator everyone has 400 carry weight and 800 stash and the servers are not able to load all that for everyone and load a biolding wall on time. My 2 cents
---
Besides Bethes literally saying cosmetics only?

"Pay To Win. When you are paying for advantage which normal players don't have access to unless they either pay too or will have to grind very long (weeks and months)." 
---
- Urban Dictionary
---
Not a great comparison. 
---
The game itself took millions and millions of dollars and years to make, so they wont just abandon it from bad feedback.
---
Repair kits, on the other hand, are simply one item in the game. 
---
I have no problem with repair kits, in no way are they pay to win.
---
I think you may just be unlucky - I have them and never really looked for them specifically. I got them sometime around level 40, so I doubt I got them in Whitesprings and I have only been to Cranberry Bog once, admittedly that was to the train station so it could be there. 
---
I do look for under armor at every vendor I go to, though, since they are pretty key to most of my looks. It may just be it's been sold out when you were there. Can't be much help beyond that, I do some events, but not many, and I have captured workshops a dozen times at most. Could have come from those. Or could have just been laying on a table.
---
That’s awesome! I’m glad to hear so many positive reactions to it honestly at first I kept hearing and seeing negative reactions on it
---
Is this confirmed?
---
Same
---
So guess we aren’t getting a little bit of atoms for the past weeks challenges of nothing but camera stuff?
---
Yeh repair kits suck but i'm not gonna go nuclear on it haha
---
Ruined the burrows quest and nuke silos twice for me this month. Burrows was basically non existent because of this. Nothing.
---
You must be one of the cry babies!
---
We’re still getting fucked one way or another
---
I completely suspect this too lol. "Player pacifies the yao gaui... it then lines up over mannequin... creating a whole new type of beast. Yes... yes..."
---
No, I couldn't offer cash, money and gaming is just crazy to me. I'm cheap, I buy a game and that's it. long ago when they started to release dlc for games, I learned to just start waiting for GOTY. When you have a family and bills, you begin to see games as what they are, games.
---
I have not spent any money on the game. None. So, you clearly don’t understand. It’s not a problem with Bethesdas money, but the money fo76 is bringing in. Why would you waste resources paying devs and workers to update the game when you aren’t making any money? It makes no sense.
---
Hope so and I have over 2k at the moment
---
&gt;I will add that radiation is broken:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;1)Sometimes in a nuke zone, you can get no radiation at all. [Video](https://youtu.be/0sPRlMdMHJg)  
---
&gt;2)Rad resist legendary effect doesn't add Rad Resist. [Video](https://youtu.be/hoabtcBtIQA)  
---
&gt;3)There is an invisible buff that makes going into a nuke zone with a 393RR PA (\~2rad/s) better than my build with 759RR build (11 rad/s). Same with hazmat suit. [Video](https://youtu.be/ioq15WjeG_8)
---
If I got anything, at all, you could have it.
---
Damn that's a nice find! I just got my X-01 schematics, can't wait to put it together with all of the new Aluminum we'll be able to find!
---
2 players have full sentinel gear and tse handmade and stand there emptying clip after clip until their weapons break, but one has a repair kit! Zomgwtfbbq p2w!!!
---
See, there's an example.
---
A really really stupid example, but an example.
---
Fyi, in that scenario it still ends up a draw as both players die irl of tedium.
---
WoW had a decent system to prevent this sort of thing. Limits to mailbox sizes (# of mails) and a limit to how long it will stay in there before returning to sender, say 3 days or a week at most. You could game it a bit and bounce things back and forth instead of keeping it in your stash, but do it with more than a few items and now you've just got a harder to maintain stash that could potentially have an item get lost if both your mailboxes are full and the mail has nowhere to go.
---
I’m gonna buy one just to spite you.
---
Nope
---
Can't have Quad and Two-Shot on the same weapon.
---
It’s lacking options. That’s all. The system that’s been built works exactly how it’s meant to, and how it’s been built to work. So no, not broken, but we can safely say it’s lacking option.
---
LPT: swap to another weapon instead of reloading, then swap back. It's ditching the invisible ammo in your magazine if you tell it to reload.
---
My Quad Explosive 90% reduced weight Cryolators damage is not affected by the Explosive Perk card last time I played with the weapon, I can double check when the servers are up.
---
Yup. I always have a backup weapon that will get me by until I can find a workbench to repair at. Even my stealth sniper has a minimum of a revolver backup, and she’s only got 1 str. And if it’s a big fight like the queen, I bring multiple guns. 
---
My HW dude carries like 9 different ranged weapons (thank you Bear Arms) plus 2 melee weapons.
---
Precisely, let better matters take up your mental real estate
---
No, more players didn't want them in. Go read this subreddit, or the official bethesda forums. No one wanted them. There was massive uproar everywhere about not wanting them. You can't even find any posts of people actually wanting them in any of the forums.
---
Bear Costume as seen in Super Troopers
---
Even if the "loud majority" were the only ones who wanted Bethes to keep their promises, FO76 will get even MORE bad press for going back on what they said. 
---
Maybe because after the backlash they gave us ABSOLUTELY ZERO FEEDBACK FOR A WEEK.  They literally stopped posting or replying to anything for a week.  They only then started with their cutesy little posts about loving people finding teddy bears and even after asking them multiple times for clarification on the repair kits completely ignored them.  And now they announce 'thanks for the feedback, but screw you and we'll do anything we want'.
---
You're not counting on those of us that think they're entirely pointless, and won't waste the Atoms. I'm probably among the majority of players who feel the same.
---
I'd rather just have new skins for my gunz. :)

I just reverted back to the FO76 drivers 416.94 for Nvidia and I'm crashing less.

Thank for the quick answer
---
the real question is how im ever gonna recover from how hurt my feelings are :(
---
I think a lot of people on this subreddit don't know what Pay to Win really is.  Play Game of Thrones: Conquest.  That, is pay to win.
---
GOD DAMN SPOILERS
---
are you trying to put them on a plain gatling laser or ultracite gatling laser?
---
Supply and demand... there literally had to be a demand for the item in order to direct developers and pay them to develop an in game item. That’s what we don’t see here... we only see people upset about them being in store. 
---
Sorry but no business is going to create an item without the demand for it.
---
&gt; I just reverted back to the FO76 drivers 416.94 for Nvidia and I'm crashing less.
---
A slope that is slippery
---
I agree.  Haven’t repaired my power armor in weeks.
---
And you are whining about people publicly whining about other people.
---
And I am whining about you whining about him/her whining publicly about other people.
---
The cycle never ends.
---
does anyone understand the pylon change to encryptid?
---
You tried. You failed.
---
That is like saying cosmetics are a slippery slope to pay to win. Neither cosmetics nor repair kits are anything close to pay to win.
---
This. I don't have issues repairing stuff. But I want to have atoms when that new cool power armor paint job comes out.
---
50 lb would be enough
---
I had to rotate my camp device thingy because it kept spawning me with 1 foot off of the cliff and I'd slide down if I wasnt paying attention. Good thing i live in my power armor or else there'd be a pile of paper bags down there
---
No problem. FYI, TS and quad fill the same slot.
---
No worries, I'm anxiously closing/opening my BGS launcher hoping I can hop in before lunch!
---
Some things in life have to be worked for and take time...
---
Uhhhh don't you think their decision to break (heartily bend, perhaps) their promise to keep the Atom Shop cosmetic only is a direct extension of the fact that the game was not as profitable as they expected and thus they must find new revenue streams starting with items that circumvent important gameplay loops? And that they likely aren't going to stop here as  pay-to-repair opens the door to any number of convenience items that circumvent 76's "light survival" elements, like maybe a cooler that keeps your food from spoiling, or a hydration pack that keeps you from getting thirsty, or vaccines to keep you from getting diseases, or a vertibird uber so you can fast travel while overencumbered, or resource packs to avoid gathering materials, or anything else you can think of that'll make the games mechanics become irrelevant?
---
Me thinks you're incorrect friendo
---
At a disadvantage to whom? The level 200 players that have invested countless hours into resource gathering and perks that already make repair kits useless? Or at a disadvantage to the AI? 
---
You naturally progress through the game. Of course a low lvl player will be at a 'disadvantage' to anyone who has played the game for even a minute longer.
---
A plain laser. Can you now add ultracite mods to a plain laser ?
---
Might want to read the patch notes again, literally the only thing that drops them is the SBQ.
---
&gt; when you load into Whitesprings resort to do shopping, if you just run
---
PRO TIP: you can also run to the level 3 locked room downstairs and to open it with zero lock perks owned/equipped. Cash stash  there.
---
Could always generate the advanced ones as well, for free.
---
Exactly, so many people think you can have aa and ts together as well.
---
I'm an active player and I repair my weapons about every 4-5 days on average.  I run white knight, power patcher or lucky break ( depending on whether I'm in power armor or not ).  I use fix it good and weapon artisan to get to 200% when I need to.  Proof positive that unless they break all these cards, I have zero need for any repair kits.  
---
Tldr: Upkeep your damn equipment like a good wastelander and you'll never need 1 repair kit
---
What evidence do you have that a majority of the player base is opposed to the changes proposed and the inclusion of repair kits? Reddit is a small sliver of the player base represented and it too is pretty evenly split. 
---
Again, I don't need to defend their decisions to punch holes in your arguments against them. Has anyone heard from Pete Hines since those comments? Has he made any public facing statements regarding any element of the game? Sounds to me like Pete Hines' word was just that, HIS word. 
---
Are micro transactions scummy and underhanded? Yep, you better believe they are. Are they an absolutely reality across the entire market? Yes, and even more increasingly so. Getting bent out of shape over otherwise benign implications does not bolster your case against their more nefarious uses.
---
I accidentally duped my excavator pa
---
Thank you stranger Now I am not gonna buy repair kits because you told it
---
&gt;Once you’ve acquired a Camera, you’ll begin the new “Bucket List” quest, which allows you to finish the tourist’s photography collection, **if you so desire.**

Well, since there's nothing else to do beyond grind overly tedious challenges for chump change level atoms...
---
So I can expect a long video from Juicehead and Jim Sterling on YouTube later this evening then?
---
I'm trying not to get into the habit, because I'm sure it'll be fixed soon.  Makes Dragons pretty damn OP by just swapping from one to the other for crazy sustained firepower.
---
Boo fucking hoo dude a big company run by a bunch of people changed their mind. It literally changes absolutely nothing if you don't want it to, you're just so fucking thirsty for a reason to hate on Bethesda you'll latch onto anything
---
The majority of the player base is probably not aware and could care less.  Rediit members/playes are a tiny minority.
---
You mean the backlash that was muted because the mods of this sub were actively deleting posts about in order to funnel everyone into the mega thread after 24 hours?
---
That'd be pretty funny.
---
F N A 💯
---
No
---
Disadvantage compared to another level 5 player who has disposable income to spend on atoms.
---
Normally I just cryolate them into a harmless sheepcicle but I might give this a go.
---
Does it reset if you reshoot before a minute? That'd be funny.
---
ah cool. .. don't have to do this one now. :/
---
I'm with you who gives a damn and why the hell is this such an issue! This is going to be a god send during the queen fight when all your good guns are broken and your just trying to naw on her leg cause that's all you got left! Come on ppl just give it a chance!
---
Yea same here ... gotta find all those plans ;)
---
And omg yes, Purveyor can't come soon enough ... 
---
(but I do have a bad feeling that they won't just let us "Buy" our dream legendarys from him ... personally, I think he's gonna give us some sort of rerolling mechanics for the items. You know, Pay 10 Weapons \* to reroll one minor treat, pay 20 Weapon \* to reroll the Main stats, and so on)
---
PS4, thanks though
---
Then how do you not know  this?
---
you're not my supervisor
---
More mods? How about some mods? There isn't anything than Prime receiver.
---
Pay to win has literally been going on here on Reddit since the game came out... you think everyone that has a TSE or unyielding or sentinel armor got it in a drop? No... 
---
Those are bigger advantages over a repair kit.
---
Laser weapons now do an extra 20% damage, weigh 20lbs. more each.
---
How could they solo Sheepsquatch in 2 min. You'd die in about 30 seconds if you're the conduit for all 3 pylons and that's the only way to damage it
---
obviously i did not know that.
---
The biggest issue is Bethes going back on their word. This could easily lead to a slippery slope.
---
[This wiki page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) has a really good break down of how legendary modifiers work, just for your future reference. Handy if you're trading with players and after something specific. :)
---
I would interact with so many more people if this was a thing. Right now I don't trade at all, because I've had bad experiences trying to get groups with people and I don't feel it's worth the hassle. But if I could go to a trade forum, agree on a price or trade with someone and we can just mail items back and forth, that would be prefect. Don't need a trade hub, don't need an auction house, just need mail. ^^although ^^those ^^things ^^would ^^be ^^nice.
---
still no fix for the excavator armor bug. =(
---
so tired of relogging. =(
---
On Xbox one and it’s honestly one of the main reasons one of my buddies stopped playing. His CAMP was next to two mob spawns and so he’s continuously taking damage while at a black screen.
---
Longer load in times to secure the environment would be very nice
---
Bought it like 4 times (Three times for friends) and mine was collectors.  I keep wanting to have high hopes, kept purchasing Atoms ($20-$40 amounts) to give support but God damn a fan can only be pushed so far.
---
wow!  thanx! +1
---
PS4  Just today she bugged in the bog and got stuck, Spent 700+ 10mm rounds, 45rounds and broke 2 guns, dropped her to below half HP after she regen'd with 14mins to go and the game froze completely 
---
She bugs all the time from people trying to pull her outside the nuke zone and her hitting her leash limit and regaining full HP and getting stuck right after or running off.
---
You've just been lucky and i've been unlucky.
---
Wait really?
---
add pc to the list
---
That implies that I have ever spent a dime in the atom shop to begin with
---
its worth it you can get class freak to lower the HP reduction and starched genes lvl 2 to keep it and use radaway. pair it with a bloodied weapon and other mutations and you can gank anything on your own
---
How often do you get shot up do you need so much of the “rarer materials” that you have to repair so often where this is an issue?  You are either bullet sponging or dying repeatedly which I suggest you try a different strategy in either case.
---
Agreed, the only person this is for is the unprepared and impatient.
---
Wish I could upvoted you again
---
Good for you, goodbye then. glad you won’t enjoy the shit game then.
---
Don't cry. I have so many other games and game companies to play.  Bethesda does not need my money or care about my opinion, as many of you also do not care, and that is just fine with me. Which is why I am taking my time and money elsewhere.  Win for me!
---
Had this happen to my friend, too, on PS4
---
If you find one, can I have it? I only have single shot explosives. 😲
---
So other players sold their loot to that vendor recently? I've got to vendors after a SBQ and seen 20+ pieces of legendary junk. Just gotta be in the right place at the right time.
---
Also I believe if a player that sold something logs off, the gear they sold vanishes too, or something to that effect.
---
Wish they released the legendary vendor before pictures and repair kits in this patch. So much extra weight.
---
I'm not talking about just this subreddit, I'm talking about the official bethesda forums, and pretty much every other forum on the internet.
---
In case you missed it, they have an /s at the end of the sentence.
---
The only time I can think of that repair kits might be useful is in the SBQ fight. I've broken all my weapons there before (when I forget to reequip makeshift warrior or gunsmith), I usually run to the elevator shed and hop out of my power armor, repair stuff as fast as I can, and hop back in. Then chug radaway (I don't use rad-x). That said, I only intend to use the "improved" repair kits, and probably only in very rare instances like that. The normal repair kits have no appeal to me as a higher level player. Lower level players will find them useful, I'm sure, maybe there will be some low intelligence (stat) builds that come from it.
---
This can not be upvoted enough.
---
We started the TVFC (The Veterans Fallout Community) and we have other games as well, all vets. I started developing the IVGC (International Veterans Gaming Community) website to link them all together. All vets! Groups and pages are on Facebook, if you dm me I can send you links or just message me via the page!
---
Ok. So maybe level 20? Doesn't make my argument less valid. A repair kit takes no resources. At level, say, 20, I don't have Fix it Good anyway so 100% is the best I can get. Player A server hops for 30 minutes to get enough ballostic fibre to repair all his armor. Player B does it in 10 seconds with a credit card. Paying creates an objectively different experience. That is what pay to win is.
---
Are you able to login now?
---
Thanks for letting me know I am number 1 while on my way out!
---
You mean the whiny basement nerds on reddit cried about nonsense? Most of the players don't care.
---
I thought they where cancelling the repair kit in the atomic shop due to community backlash.
---
I just keep a spare weapon on me an switch to that when my main breaks. Then look for a bench to fix it.
---
What's the difference from this and buying stimpacks or ammo at this point? Both replace grinding with money. Really dumb logic from Bethesda. How have they become such money grubbers?
---
"Utility Items in the Atomic Shop" : NO. NON. NADA. **YOU. STOP. THIS.** NO. Why? Because we perfectly know that it start with a repair kit and it end with pay to win like TES:Blades. NO. You really want to fucked up your reputation?
---
Well I just save a ton of money by switching to Geico!
---
Ah. Gotcha. Thank you!
---
And if they do offer competitive advantage they'll just nerf the shit out of something you paid for, while not adjusting cost or refunding either.
---
Everyone loses, yaye!
---
well how do you buy the game in the first place if you didn't have a credit card?
---
That's not a bad idea, that's the only sane thing to do.
---
CnHm + (n+m/4) O2 =&gt; n CO2 + m H2O
---
Liberator prime basically just a giant liberator that one shots me
---
I thought I was the first to post this, then someone showed me you had the same idea 20 minutes before me, good show ol' chap
---
Well compared to the magic armors that make you unkillable while standing still or hopping like a moron in a gunfight, there's absolutely nothing need to be balanced for stealthboys. Actually players reported stealthboys III has stability issues, hope they got that fixed.
---
My 'super armour' [X-01] feels close-to-worthless against enemy players ;)
---
Why?
---
PLEASE. I would never fast travel again. I would put on my witch costume, get on the mic, and drive by everyone dinging my little bell telling them “I’ll get you my pretty!”
---
If something is dropped by 1% of the enemies you kill that item would be rare. Even if they drop every single time from that 1%
---
Weak comeback.. #sad
---
Fuck, I really wanted some Chocolate milk but I needed that kill streak.
---
That's probably true too most of the time I come across them they are no where to be found
---
The patch notes explain their rationale completely. You can accuse Beth of a lot but any accusation that they don’t justify and explain their decisions is completely baseless.
---
Then I guess no one will be buying them so no worries right?
---
Bethesda brought this onto themselves. They didn't deliver what was promised, so the people who thought it was a good idea to release the game as it was should be paying for it, not the consumer that was misleaded by them. Fix the game and people will come back and if you are doing a real good job, new people will also buy the game. It is that easy. Bethesda should suffer the consequences of their fuck up not the player by feeling forced to pay for a repair kit because they make some materials unfairly rare.
---
Havent tried yet and probably wont try until either later tonight or tomorrow maybe for a bit, im busy
---
Is that why you play Fallout? To compete with the progression of other players? Sorry but I don't see the point you're trying to make here. Why does it matter that someone else's items are in better condition than mine when it comes to a co-op game? 
---
And if anything, repair kits are a disadvantge because you'd miss out on potentially exploring a location to scavenge for junk/other items. You're paying to experience less of the game you paid for in the first place.
---
You can't repair dignity.
---
Exactly! And I guess there are some who just want to tank all discussion. Reminds me of people who got bored with the game and started griefing for fun.
---
People are mainly mad because they stated 'cosmetics only in the Atomic shop' and now have introduced a convenience item.  Slippery slope can happen and they are worried this is testing the waters.
---
thats the future bud
---
yes, but if it says ultracite prime gatling laser receiver, it can only be crafted on the ultracite gatling laser
---
Thank you, added.
---
Lol you're an idiot. Repair kits do not give you an advantage.
---
Wow you are a whiner! 
---
Please quit playing the game. We don't need whiners.
---
Has anybody else been loaded into a disco colored landscape? Since the last update I have spawned 2 or 3 times with the ground being neon green and purple which will stay for 15 mins or so. I've also had it in the past where the ground stays dark in some areas. I also had the lighting stay at blast zone levels everywhere when fast travling out of the blast zone.
---
Let the rage consume you and dress up like darth vader? You know it’s the right choice... 😁
---
Oh dear god, this dude is comparing himself to Jesus. Get rid of the “holier than thou” attitude and open your mind up to other, correct, viewpoints.
---
What about the Power Armor bug that won’t allow you to attach mods. I really hope that’s fixed...
---
yeah.  a friend of mine and i are starting to collect lead and other materials to make ammo to sell for all those PvPers who power thru ammo as if ww3 was in full swing!  lol  :-)
---
went and did the excavator PA quest line and bought some custom paint recently.

“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”

Downvoting people doesn’t make you right.

Don't let the door hit you in the butt on your way out
---
or even BOS armored ghouls... instead of just.. gross naked ghouls?
---
I was excited too, week after beta, but disapointed very fast. I am glad they fixed stability. Death SBQ on first launch must be great memory
---
DAE repair kids bad!!!!11!1 updoots pl0x!
---
It's just if you're quitting forever in sure some other players would benefit from some of the stuff you won't be using
---
Well, they have already crossed line with Atomic shop items. Most of them are not even on Fallout context anymore. Game is becoming more and more a place where people dress up like clowns and ride with pink unicorns.
---
Are the repairs the same cost as when you originally build said item?
---
As for workshops, I have only found a few where you could place miners? for silver ore and other ores. Are there any that generate more useful items for noobs or are these mostly for high level players?
---
thanks, Uncle Tom...
---
Yes😂
---
Wanna bet that they'll add legendary coins in the atomic shop when the legendary vendor is released?
---
Welcome to America, where every corporation lies to you for their own gain.
---
**Just because they said the SBQ can drop it doesn't mean it will drop it every time**, if it was a common drop by the SBQ they would have just said "it is dropped by the SBQ" and left it at that, the fact that after stating it was dropped by her, they then stated it would be a rare drop. So that literally means it will be a rare drop by the SBQ.
---
Nah but announcements saying they're breaking their promise straight from bethesda are.
---
I hate how I am really excited for the camera and being able to craft mods for it since I am a photojournalism student. Guess since lenses will be a hell lot cheaper than in real life
---
It’s just a quality of life thing. Saves the time of switching perks and collecting junk to scrap.
---
Most people don't care. Casuals will buy things. It's only the reddit basement nerds crying about it anyway. No one else cares.
---
Please look after ur mental health ❤🙏🏽
---
Ok cool, do you know if the promise receiver makes the laser green? That’s the only thing I’m after tbh lol
---
I always nuke so that the southeastern tip of the nuke zone is hitting Fissure Prime, and I fight her just outside of the nuke zone at Forward Station Delta. Honestly the fight has been like clockwork for over a month for me. She comes out, I aggro her and make sure she's on me, she lands just outside of Forward Station Delta, and we proceed to burn her down in 3 minutes or less every time. Super easy.
---
What’s wrong with one person being able to do something? I’d say a large chunk of Fallout 76 players are solo players.
---
People like to bitch. The simple fact is, if it starts making a dif in PVP they will just disallow usage in Survival.
---
It is THEIR JOB to take our feedback to the company.  We are expressing our outrage regarding broken promises that is then their job to take to the company.  We don't expect the community people to make the decisions, but they damn well better be expressing how pissed off we are to the management.
---
I personally prefer more post apocalyptic themed items
---
Prime* sorry
---
If I'm remebering right, dataminers only found it needed some basic stuff (1 oil, 1 plastic, maybe some acid).
---
Me too. I got all 3 just recently
---
No one would Pay to Skip a fun part of the game.  Having these for sale admits that repair is at least in some way annoying part of the game.
---
If a part of the game is annoying it should be changed, or minimized.  By Selling something to skip it each time, the developer becomes my antagonist.  Did I find one too few screws to repair this gun because they want me to buy that repair kit?  Why does it take so much ballistic fiber to...!  
---
Money should be paid to add more fun to the game, patches should be used to remove annoyances.  The nature of the game is changed with single use item sales.
---
Lol everything you said is speculation and baseless.
---
Reddit in a nutshell
---
Lol generic ass comment

Getting bumrushed as a ranged build by level 60 ghouls despite there not being a high level anywhere near me kind of does that, especially with the stagger from melee attacks and high radiation damage.
---
So lets just roll over and take it eh?
---
No im just not too stupid to rememver that when they announced them suddenly all the community managwrs went quiet for a week
---
As far as I can tell the new camera is just an in-game "action" camera. Equippable like the binoculars and can be used to take quick snaps without all the neat filter options.
---
Whereas the normal camera will still exist and be more for setting up cool shots with all the filter options and such that we have.
---
Tldr
---
afaik yes both cameras will exist simultaneously but have different advantages and disadvantages.
---
You should go and see some of my posts and comments today then and see how many downvotes they have, as well as othwer people who have similar opinions. Two weeks ago, people were ready to speak about it. There were posts with thousands of upvotes that said that repair kits should not be there. Today, the same posts are getting comments like "It's not pay to win" and "stop being a crybaby".
---
Ok🤷🏻‍♂️ So they changed their minds. This isn't a game breaking thing. It's just a convenience issue
---
You go head to head with another player in survival, one of you paid for a repair kit in the atom store and the other didn't. Both of your guns break. Who do you think is most likely to win that fight and why?
---
Yup, I roll with a shotty, handmade and axe for that reason.
---
One thing I have noticed is that they semi-stack. 1 is a 25c reward and 2-5 is a 40c reward I have noticed different amounts of XP though, I cannot confirm whether or not I was running max Inspirational, so I don't want to for sure say there is or isn't differing XP. The first time I turned 5 in I got a pretty decent reward. Since then, though it seems to be mostly normal drops purified waters, stimpacks. With travel agent on and playing by yourself it's 17c both ways so unless you have an anchor to stay at one of the locations I think it's better to turn 2 in at a time.
---
That really depends on your machine... My computer is 10 years old and maybe takes 10 seconds for the world to load around me at first login. My friend has a brand new computer and his world is loaded instantly after the load screen. Pisses me off cause he can always fast travel faster than me lol.
---
Unfortunately for consoles, they're limited by their hardware.
---
such drama
---
I always check my instigating dcg for durability before entering a fight if it needs repair I’ll do that or favourite my furious dcg for quick change
---
Check your Xbox messages. You should have an invite.
---
Good! I was worried you’d need flux or something.
---
First they came for the repair materials, then our ammo and by the time they were selling legendary weapons at the atom shop, there was no one left to complain about it...
---
It’s just repairing guns ffs. Everyone had to stop crying
---
ok buddy
---
I do not know what that's about.
---
People didn't forget, mods created a mega thread and told everyone to complain about it there.
---
Well see the problem is that these Repair kits can only be bought via atomic shop, unlike ESO which can be bought by their shop and in-game vendors, and the advanced ones can only be gotten through two quests (known by data mining), the SQB and Sheepsquatch, which aren't a piece of cake to complete, since you have to put in more effort to actually get the event to even start.
---
Repair kits can be used in any circumstance, and with this gamer, an exploit will surely be found.
---
I full understand it's about business, but they could have done it by a better way, better atomic shop items, because hell I don't know anyone who wanted a Princes Pink bed in a wasteland, and if they actually put more effort into them. That nuke mobile don'st light up, doesn't spin at all, so with the pics it shows it's given a false impression.
---
And honestly before these were announced, repair kits weren't a very big community need, yes some people did want them, but now how they're being sold to us. In FoNV and Fo3 they were rare to come by, but they were in the base game and free, it just acted as another Aid item, but in this case it just repairs weapons/armours (and now CAMP pieces aswell, which honestly is even more scummy). I don't see why Bethesda needs to start selling us aid items, because that will react a whole lot more.
---
When Repair kits were announced, another thing they tagged in the same paragraph was refrigerators, ammo converters(this is heavily requested) and also being able to send junk to your CAMP (what? Who asked for that, defeats the entire purpose of being cautious about not dying, since there won't be much to lose unless you die in the moment your farming). The only thing requested out of those was ammo conversion/scrapper or being able to sell it, and refrigerators for aesthetic reasons and since food seems to spoil quicker than before.
---
And in the new patch notes, they didn't seem to repair the god awful menu repair change that was put in place? With it suddenly coincidentally working for the Repair kits, and many of the arguments before where people said "Oh it may be a plan" has just completely gone out the window, I'm honestly really disappointed in Bethesda rn.
---
Yeah. I have no interest paying atoms to repair a weapon to only 100%.
---
Didn’t think about this . Explosive legendary buff?
---
You sir will have a quite unfair advantage now. Use your power wisely!
---
I absolutely can help kill the scorchbeast queen, I am working on a scorchbeast queen killing kamikaze deathclaw gauntlet build. I have not failed a SBQ fight since I began tinkering with it.
---
So much for the integrity of Pete Hines.
---
Rippppp
---
Thanks for letting me know, I was clearly unaware. People have said that the quad harpoon gun works how you'd hope, so I wonder why the crossbow doesn't.
---
You're terrible at replying to an insult loser.
---
If i wasnt an indebted college student I'd give you a gold
---
Eh, the difference is I'm not upset.  I play multiple games and will just move on at some point anyway.  Beth will do what they want to do.  No point in being pissed about it.
---
"Stop complaining, you've only been punched in the face. Just because they punched you in the face, doesn't mean they will stab you later"
---
This is out today with the patch. It's the holdable camera weapon they mention in the patch notes.
---
1. I don’t think they do but I’ve also never tried 2. The mutation requires you to not where armor the legendary lets you where armor I don’t have an answer to the other two
---
Ultimately I agree it isn't P2W but it's a fact that these repair kits are not cosmetic, they do affect gameplay even if it's arguably minute.  If these are accepted by the community then what is coming next? I think that is what is causing the uproar.
---
Also, the pvp in this game is an imbalanced joke. You can run the exact same perks, you just have to return to base more often.
---
War ... War never changes
---
Up your ass with broken glass, dude. I just said they should go ahead with it. What more do you want?
---
Nu uh! Cause 100% is as high as you can go. You go ahead and repair your gun to "200%", it's really just 100% anyway.
---
I think that's what all of the SJW's don't get. Some of us couldn't care less, or would just ignore them anyways. But all of the wah wah's makes me more inclined to buy them out of spite. Buy them, and then destroy them. Just because I can. Erma gerd, P2W!!!!
---
 It really is a non-issue.
---
Agree.
---
It's a 'well … shit … I forgot to repair and now I am in the middle of something' use item. The 100% repair is sub par as it is. 
---
It ***literally*** has no impact on any other player … with the possible exception of giving you the equivalent of 3 or 4 ballistic fiber … there is no measurable impact over anyone else
---
Cool, still going to play the game regardless. It’s fun
---
You payed 60 dollars to have more carry weight!!!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEE P2W P2W!!!!!
---
whatevew can i do make u feew bettew... ÚwÙ even though u huwt my feeeeewings
---
Could work. I wouldn’t mind that either, at least you could wait it out then. When I see an invisible enemy running, I’m just inclined to leave the fight
---
[While reading your comment, I had this sound in my head.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfwA79JwS6Q)
---
How am I enabling their behavior when I've not given them a penny and only give money to companies who only sells purely cosmetic things.
---
How to make me instantly use a Broadsider
---
What's an aspext?
---
Because you have Weapon Artisan which  is literally 100 times better and not a waste of Atoms?
---
Sheepsquatch hordes are coming I think . The event says it sometimes when doing horde events
---
It's a horrible thought, but expect more to come, since in the same article that announced repair kits, they talked about looking into Refrigerators, ammo converters and being able to send junk to CAMPS... If this keeps up, I don't think this game will become the market success that they want it to be...
---
Oooh backpack now that’s something I want
---
I wanted a mission... and for my sins they gave me one.
---
You're entitled to your own stupid opinion 🤷🏻‍♂️ Lol
---
Not the ones you purchase.
---
Cool thanks for sharing.
---
I'd guess quest items are by default not super-duperable as I don't see the keyword for it on the recall keycard (or on the Mainframe Core):  [https://imgur.com/a/Yjp3fLY](https://imgur.com/a/Yjp3fLY)
---
So yeah, you just rolled over and are taking it.
---
All you guys crying about repair kits and literally no one is going to use them except lazy people. Who brings 1 weapon with them? Fools thats who.
---
Personally, I'm gonna mod the repair kits onto my power armor and be truly invincible!
---
As someone who prefers PVE? Yes.
---
I was farming her really much. This is bug existing since beta and happens for no reason. 
---
Anoying. Just server hop and launch another nuke. This game is survival, hard life, cry in corner.
---
I just noticed you going around telling everyone their’s was like yours so I wanted to tell you your’s was like his.
---
Which ruined any chance of the issue actually being addressed. The sticky thread was basically dead after a day.
---
And the community people from Bethesda went radio silent for a full week with NOT ONE WORD from them.  After that posting 'awww look at the cutesy teddy bears you found' and didn't respond when directly asked about the P2W feature coming.
---
The ones you earn are better lolol
---
it’s a meme you fucking stewed prune
---
Kill the scorchbeast queen and win free ones that are better, or do the daily challenges to win atoms and spend those.
---
Nobody is making you spend extra money and honestly this is just a convenience so you dont have to spend scrap at a bench and can just repair in the field.
---
I get what you guys are saying. I'm saying it's not a crime to change your mind on something like this, especially when it isn't harming gameplay
---
You type like a tribesperson.
---
Never used the X-01 as I don't like the looks. Also not really into PvP, but I have understood that PA in PvP is close to useless.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope
---
We can't just not buy repair kits, we have to boycott the atom store entirely. If we just don't buy repair kits it doesn't hurt Bethesda to ask. We need to make it hurt then to ask. So they should lose money they otherwise might get.
---
That's sounds like it's more to do with the game servers than your PC having trouble loading in assets.
---
Escape Artist works while you are in combat. If you "teabag" your way through a fight you can greatly confuse enemies.
---
&gt; or comfort
---
That would be pay for convenience, there's no 'winning'. Wake me up when they start selling serum recipes that give you hp/dmg increase in pvp.
---
I won't buy them because they are useless and I'll be voicing my opinion that they are borderline breaking the idea of Atom shop. But on the other hand I won't engage in any slippery slope fallacy or P2W imaginary scenarios...

Valentine's Day quest in May? Or in October, by in game date? What the heck?
---
Because when Bethesda has motivation to sell these that will easily change.
---
ballistic fiber is hell to find. you have to dedicate a good whole week looting millitary bags and tape daily to fix your armor.
---
time I could spend playing the game. but not anymore! thanks to repair kits!
---
that's mobile gacha mentality.
---
You should try another hobby, or another game.  Could help dilute your obvious high salt content.
---
I mean, that's kind of the thing, isn't it; no matter how you slice it, repair kits don't make sense. Who are these even for? Like, who doesn't maintain a decent-sized stock of junk to keep their primary loadout functioning?
---
The only way how they could make repair kits relevant would be by removing workbenches from the world, which... man, that'd be scummy.
---
Thanks bot
---
you mean the guy in charge of marketing lied to get people to buy a game?
---
i guess I should sue whoever marketed my phone's battery as lasting all day, too.
---
it doesn't matter what anyone says will or won't happen, he is not the sole entity involved in decision making.
---
But... Bethesda lied to you! Muster up some indignation will you? Sheesh.
---
Done the sheepsquatch and got wood armor why are you doing this Bethesda.
---
Nah, that'd lock out low-level players. This is something they want to encourage, because screenshots are basically adverts for the game when you share them online.
---
Lol....wtf
---
Maybe u could hold it like one of those scorched swinging a heavy weapon with one hand
---
Just what every WoW player wants, more Stranlethorn lol.
---
Bethesda is really rolling the dice against public scrutiny. They lost many expected sales at launch. You would think they couldn't afford to piss any more of their users off at this point but I guess not.
---
Everybody kicked a goal!
---
You can use one to hold down the corner of your tent, or to keep papers from blowing off your desk, or you can throw one at a glowing wolf to distract it while you run away.
---
See!
---
Yeah or you can do Two Dragons build or blunder mix. Swap between the two weapons to negate the reloading on the other one.
---
Adult sized Giddyup Buttercup mount. Make it happen Bethesda! I think there's already a mod that does this in Fallout 4 actually.
---
well now ur just being meaaan :’( u bwoke all the bones in my tiny wittle heart
---
Never cried about it, Never said they were p2w, had you read my comment properly the point im making is Bethesda are full of shit.
---
Typical fo76 reddit, full of shills.
---
Pfft, melee wont work on it. You gotta jam a repair kit into a fat man and shoot it at her.
---
I have 19agi, speed demon and kangaroo mutation. I can kite that shitty robot and with 4/5 sentinel armor i survive first hit.
---
But somebody have to use pylons and other guys must shot from roof. Never happens, chaos!
---
I do. My therapist makes good bank.  She also does not put non-cosmetic items in her shop.
---
Oh so you're a jerk to others and a benevolent kindly soul to others? One behavior doesn't cancel out another.
---
you can't tell for everyone. Repair kits are available in survival too
---
Yes like we all don't know how well the drops from the queen work.
---
Lol no my stepbrother has the game and sometimes I'll use one of his alts to move over junk to one of my other characters.
---
As if we didn't enjoy finding random pages in our inventories years and years later...
---
I don't use weapon condition perks on my PvP characters, but I do have a minimum of 3 points in luck because without it I can't equip fix it good or weapon artisan. If a non-perk, atom shop purchase allows me to get to 150%, that's essentially paying for 1 perk point (fix it good/weapon artisan rank 2) that I no longer have to keep in intelligence and can spec further towards offensive/defensive perk points. 
---
I'm not trying to stretch it's utility, this just puts it in context. If eBay sales of duped items show anything, it's that there exists a segment of the player base that is willing to pay to win. This element is no longer limited to third party sales
---
This is the top issue I want fixed. It takes about 60 seconds for the world to load and if i try to move before it loads in it can cause a crash
---
I’m not buying any, hopefully we’ll show them pay to win won’t work for us.
---
Probably a similar social characteristic within us all which caused us to respond with similar posts.
---
I was thinking about this situation a few days ago, people who quit and may have a hard to find item... Does that situation have some type of programming in place to help keep some of these items in the game somehow? Not sure if that makes sense, basically I'm worrying about people with TSE and AAE quitting and those weapons being gone from the game.
---
Yeah, we all face the same problems :/ It reminds me that Pararad and diluted Rad-X are labeled as suppressing mutations, but aren't.
---
I would be inclined to agree with you on the hopping, but a lot of shooter games have that mechanic and they do give you VATS to remedy it(another issue with the stealthboys in combat) and sentinel armor is easy to kill, just use a crit on them. If you use better crit 3, you’ll shred most sentinel players who dare just stand still.
---
Stealthboys need a nerf. They should be vanishing tools, not offensive weapons. If you attack or take damage, you should be revealed. It’s BS to use them to attack and just maintain invisibility through the fight.
---
False. *Some* feedback is negative. *Some* is positive. Some is, like me, wait an see.
---
You obviously need a new therapist 😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
I agree with your feelings exactly.
---
This is how it starts man. You think they're just going to keep this at repair kits?
---
&gt;It ***literally*** has no impact on any other player … with the possible exception'
---
That's ***literally*** not what literally means.
---
 THIS IS THE LAST STRAW IM QUITTING!after i log inn,clear westek,server hop,clear it again,THEN IM QUITTING THE GAME!until tomorow.Repeat the process
---
if you move your camp, like an inch from where it is, everything will be fixed that was destroyed.
---
obviously this game has issues with placing blueprints, so if your camp is intricate or has a lot of foundations, this will just completely fuck it up entirely
---
It's like "I'm running away from home..."
---
Actually surprised there was actual content, I assumed this was just a patch for bug fixes, but I'm pleasantly surprised to see the camera this patch.  
---
I'm not excited about the repair kits, but I do appreciate their comment, because I do understand that having the game and its dlc remain free while keeping the Atom Shop cosmetic only wasn't a sustainable practice. So long as their existence doesn't impact my enjoyment of the game, I couldn't care less. I guess I just don't understand why people are treating this as such a betrayal (I understand they went back on a 'promise', but again it was an unsustainable one), or allowing their revulsion of it to basically throw all logic out the door and throw around speculation as if it's prognostication, frankly it's exhausting and makes it very difficult to continue being engaged with an otherwise nice community of players. There are many things to take umbrage with in Bethesda's handling of this game, but this isn't worth the outrage, at least not yet. Just don't buy them, if they can't sell convenience, they won't sell it, it's a far more useful solution than getting angry on reddit.
---
sounds legit.
---
But he is the one who made the claim multiple times in interviews, and if he said something that wasn't correct then their legal team would have gotten a hold of him and corrected him.
---
This wasn't an "oh oppsie we were wrong", this was a calculated lie they used.
---
If you are cool with them lying to you that is on you. Most people aren't.
---
I only told you that bud, it was a light hearted joke :-)
---
Haven't you heard the expression "what are you playing at" or "what is your angle". It was all in good fun, and like I said I left him or her a comment too, because they were an earlier post. I don't think anyone will give anyone anything, but it's nice that people want to still make jokes and have fun.
---
The only issue I had with the announcement is that, in the same post where these were originally announced, they mentioned "refrigerators" after increasing the rate at which food spoils. The kits themselves came not long after a nerf to White Knight, Licensed Plumber, etc. It seems like they're creating a problem and selling a solution.
---
If other items like this get added, fine. I don't really care, as long as it doesn't affect how the game currently plays, which is absolutely fine without these sorts of items. I don't need repair kits. If, sometime soon, I *start* needing them because of a "rebalance to item degredation", that's when it becomes an issue for me.
---
The repair kit itself.  It has deadly semi rounded corners.
---
At least now you are crying with a smile on your face.  That is improvement.
---
Let’s see you complain this much about people buying OP guns and armor from other players being pay to win. 
---
I’ll wait.
---
Always bank your junk. Build a stash as soon as u take over anything and store. I waltz leave lower level alone but it's great fun finding a big bag of loot.
---
Yeah, didn't say they weren't and if they were the only repair kits that got added it would be fine. The point is Bethesda made a commitment to the people that bought the game that the atom shop was going to be cosmetic only, they clearly don't plan to stick to that and if we don't demonstrate that we're pissed off about this they're going to gradually add more 'utility items' to the cosmetic shop.
---
And the pay for "convenience" has begun.
---
RIP
---
Nobody is saying it's pay to win. We're allowed to critique the decisions being made in a game that we play. I'm not threatening to leave like some people are. I think this patch had some good stuff in it too and I'm actually stoked for the camera that most people are bitching about being lame. You're the one crying my friend.
---
No springs for you.
---
&gt; **Atoms won't be spendable on anything that gives players a gameplay advantage**
---
Repair kits aren't an advantage. You can repair your own stuff with perks, or better yet **in-game, easily gotten materials.** This isn't an advantage fucks sake.
---
You can also get a BETTER version of the "pay-to-win" kit in game by killing high level enemies. Fuck, its like you read what you wanted then fucked off.
---
Youtubers and such will rip the game to shreds on this, so it certainly won't affect only the minority, as people will just see "Pay 2 Win" next to fallout 76 and just go off of that. People don't do much research before buying a game anymore.
---
“b-but it’s not even that big of a... bethesda would never... SHUT UP TROLL IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT PLAY IT!!!”
---
there guys, i typed out a template for you so you don’t have to do it yourself
---
Im crying for you bud lolll
---
All according to plan.
---
[](/nmm)
---
On just a personal level, unless these things are like 5 AP a kit, there's no way I'm buying any.  I bought $20 worth of Atom Points when I first started but now between grinding out the challenges - I try to focus on "earning" unlocks only by playing as a sort of personal challenge.   
---
No way I would set myself back on buying a 1400 AP Power Armor Unlock to buy a useless repair kit.   
---
I get 1000% why ya'll are up in arms, I'm just telling you,  not that many people are going to be buying them and I have the strong suspicion, the ones who are are still the morons who don't repair to 200% before they leave their camp every play session.
---
Did I say anything about the repair kits? No, I didn't, I only stated how they are showing the player base "wanted this" through a data grab. I don't give a marusipal mutation fuck about repair kits.
---
lol and you think that everyone with TSE's bought them lol
---
it’s bought using in game currency, it really isn’t rocket science
---
and the importants part isss
---
I fully agree with your stance. 
---
This is not Pay2Win scheme. This is no guarantee that durability will be "rebalanced". This is no exploiting of us, since the item is almost useless.
---
This is a broken promise. This is a sign that anything else Bethesda has promised may eventually change.
---
IMO they should consider hot fixing bugs they introduce rather than just sitting on the fix until next patch. Additionally, we probably shouldn't thank them for fixing things they broke to begin with
---
I think we need to more about this "Lady Bot".....
---
Atoms won't be spendable on anything that gives players a gameplay advantage - BGS
---
This ins't an advantage since you can get better ones in game. AND GUESS WHAT ELSE. You can also repair your items in game, with in-game items. Who would've thought?!
---
No  i vividly recall the standard loading screen with one of my screenshots and then afterward a black screenshot with the loading symbol in the corner for another like 30 seconds and when i spawned in my camp was already fully placed. Didnt have to wait for it to exist peice by peice.
---
It seems the sarcasm shot right over my head.
---
Kind of hard to hear expressions through text.
---
I just wish the Jackie O coat would come in pink and have the pillbox hat. Gotta complete my OG Doctor Girlfriend costume so I can continue wandering the wasteland asking strangers for cigarettes to eat.

Player A is doing something horribly wrong if his one and only weapon breaks during a 6 second PvP fight.

Good info to know, thanks! But yeah, I'm built into an embankment and moving even a little bit would probably make the whole camp unplaceable.
---
I will buy the repair kits because I want to.
---
what kind of dunkie doesn't have a backup weapon.
---
I'll wait.

Prepare for the shitty defence squad.

Well, since there's nothing else to do beyond grinding overly tedious challenges for chump change level atoms...

Can I have some springs at least? 😂🤣
---
I posted an unpopular opinion. It happens.
---
or you can hide for a sec and use repair kit from quick slot. Ballistic beer gives you 15% ranged damage but it cost you your weapon durability. I can see people who don't care about money just drink it all day and there is no drawbacks with repair kits in your inventory
---
Check eBay

I guess it would help 5% of the time in survival when my firearm breaks before I run out of ammo.

---
Yea but its only effective against Rabbits
---
it's like if you bought a car and then found out that it only drove backwards. no problem here! works exactly as intended
---
" Basic Repair Kits do not consume any of your crafting materials when repairing an item. "        
---
Call it what you want.  P2W,  Pay for convenience,  Pay for whatever.   You can now PAY real world cash to save on in game materials that you would have otherwise had to work for.

---
They keep this thread updated with maintenance status. Latest update was 3 minutes ago.
---
have a second dragon. a second weapon. There is no way that a repair kit actually gives you any kind fo an advantage lol
---
Isn't that patented by Apple?  Bethesda better watch out.
---
You're ok as long as you're not just testing them out. They should only be used for competitive advantage.
---
The non-cosmetic weapon repair kits went live with the latest patch.  
---
Big part of the pre-release marketing was that there wouldn't be any pay-to-win (stuff that alters game mechanics) in the atom store. Now there's stuff that alters game mechanics (pay-to-win) for sale in the atom store.
---
Sounds like both parties are woefully unprepared. If my main weapon breaks, I switch to my alt.  Easy peasy.
---
*Player B spends several seconds using the kit to fix their weapon*
---
*Player A pulls out their backup weapon and kills B while they're in the menu*
---
Who would be dumb enough to use a nearly broken weapon in PVP and only that weapon?
---
The alien blaster and t51b nuka cola paint
---
Buying op gear from other players is pay to win. How about cry on that first instead of making repair kits some kind of evil thing. You can find them in the wild just like you can buy them in the atom shop.
---
Okay cool thanks i'll make sure to remember that next time she flies out of the map boundaries
---
*nice*
---
I don't think Pete Hines is responsible personally for Repair Kits. I also don't think Bethesda care if they make a liar out of Pete Hines.
---
I was making observations about how they're wording things. Everyone is pretty clear on what you said, this is not news lol.
---
I don't think anyone was attacking individual devs for corporate decisions. This seems like misdirection.
---
In light of the profit motive of these companies, there is in fact no difference between cosmetic and functional items. You are rewarding the company for the development of an in-game feature which utilizes real world money. without that feature, and your immense (self described) support of it, there would be no avenue for pay to win mechanics. 
---
These repair kits are as much your fault as anyone else's, if not more. Sorry, that's the logic of this situation.
---
I'm not giving you any of my shit. I paid for the game. I earned it and I will take it with me when I go! If anything I will shove it up Bethesda's back side where it belongs. This is the worst Fallout ever. They are ruining one of the best games ever with poor quality work. At this point Bethesda is on my do not buy for at least a year list. That should be long enough for them to break it. I hope.
---
&gt;"Improved repair kits are free but rare"
---
In my case, Radshield doesn't either!
---
Cannot log in but we will have free camp item, a Go Away sign :D
---
1. No. Crouch to avoid being revealed on the compass. Perks don’t add anything. 
---
2. Difference is the mutation requires no armor or weightless while the legendary effect can be found on armor and works with weight armor. No point to stacking them. 
---
3. No idea, but I one shot people with my bloodied explosive shotgun no buffs
---
4. For anti armor calc use formula: (.75/.2) = (x/y) where x is the amount of armor penetration and y is the resulting damage increase as a percentage (decimal form).  For example an anti armor weapon that ignores 50% of armor gives the equation:  (.75/.2) = (.5/y) solving gives 13333 or 13.33% damage increase. So a shotgun that does 100 damage that ignores 50% of armor actually does 113.333 damage.
---
I don’t care about repair kits or the fact you can buy them. I understand this is a game and if I don’t like it I just don’t play.
---
I find the toxicity of this community more likely reduces my game time rather than game issues themselves. 
---
I wish dlc was paid to filter out all the people who grabbed this game at severe discount and want everything for free.
---
This is not pay to win. In the amount of time it takes you to try and fix something mid-fight, you're going to be killed. This is for the convenience of adventurers. Also, they have already said that it will be removed if they discover that it is becoming an issue with pvp
---
if people are really buying that stuff for real money then that’s their choice, Bethesda doesn’t support or endorse it
---
Same here, my luck perks restore them so I might have to repair my main gun maybe once a week or two. Don’t remembered the last time I’ve repaired armor
---
&gt; Please explain how the repair kit is not giving Person B a "competitive advantage" over Person A.
---
&gt; Go ahead, I'll wait.
---
Because if Person A leaves the fight it's over.
---
Because if Person A didn't bring a backup weapon to quick switch to when their primary breaks they deserve to die for breaking the wastelands primary rule.
---
And mostly because most of us play adventure mode and outside of a bit of worshop pew-pewy there is NO PVP in this game.
---
I hope you are enlightened.
---
PS. 
---
Always carry a backup weapon. Or two.
---
Plenty of problems with this game, but repair kits isn't one of them. Gear doesn't degrade nearly as fast as it used to, and nothing is going to break on you in the middle of a fight unless you started that fight with almost broken gear in the first place. This isn't Pay To Win.
---
Well, since I just managed to convince my buddies to come back to the game last night, I guess I'll just keep quiet about this patch update, and hope they don't check the atom shop. If they leave again, it'll be permanent, and I'll leave with them, because I don't enjoy playing alone, or with randoms.
---
If I didn't talk back so much, he wouldn't have to slap me.
---
Would also like to know this.
---
🤡 that’s me that is, I feel like a dunce. Thanks!
---
Hold up, thats TOO pay to win even for me
---
[](/karmwave)Masterminds the lot of them.
---
&gt;and if he said something that wasn't correct then their legal team would have gotten a hold of him and corrected him.
---
oh you probably actually believe this
---
just, no. that's not how that works. if it was, Peter molyneux would have gotten fired a long time ago.
---
&gt;P2W by definition means "an item, boost, buff, or anything else you can purchase with real money in a game that will give you and advantage over players who haven't spent money in the game."
---
if we are going to go by that super strict definition the people that payed into the "beta" payed to win
---
Id say people are mad cause Bethesda made the move to add the kits no one ever blames third party sites or selling sites for in game loot cause they belive its part of the economy
---
I dig, that happens to me often
---
Lol you're a failure bud.
---
Or player C carries a back up weapon and kills them both
---
LOL
---
Neither do I, it’s not going to effect my game at all.
---
People on Reddit are trading for caps or weapons, so.....no
---
Some people just accept everything AAA throws at them. Without thinking about the consequences
---
Always upvote Airplane references
---
I’ll buy extra to counter the complaining.
---
“got 76 problems but repair kits ain’t one”
---
Absolutely. And that's why I changed my mind to be completely unconcerned about the repair kit situation. Unless/until BGS addresses the above, it won't matter in any way, so I say go for it. Maybe if they find a way to better monetize the game, we'll get some decent content.
---
Yes. *Some* negative feedback. As in two weeks ago, the top 20 posts in the sub were anti-repair kits and had 100k+ upvotes combined.
---
If you and i are in a gun fight against each other, how is that repair kit going to save you? You will need atleast 10 seconds to use the kit and by then ill have you killed, skinned, and using your face as a mask. Please, use that kit in survival mode. I encourage it!!
---
find supper mutants kill a few of them have enough materiall to make a lot of ammo steel and GP wise. head to lucky hole equip excavator, leave with 1,000 lead.  
---
congrats ammo for one week done.
---
Cool thank you
---
No, I am not a winner at weight management. I'm the guy who keeps on selling legendaries to vendors
---
Scrap weapons and farm Lucky Hole Mine.
---
The market only exists because BGS refuses to address the wild imbalance issues that the above equipment combinations afford people who play them. They could shut down demand entirely with a decent rebalance patch, or go after the RMT bots... or really anything that gave us hope they gave a damn.
---
A legendary enemy, a boss, a mob, other players, you know, things in the game that you're encouraged to kill for loot that you have to be present to acquire.
---
The uproar is simply because this is going against what Bethesda said they would do at the start. It's a small someone insignificant to most Pay to Win Feature, but its still there. Now that it's there what other minuscule p2w things will they do? and when will it end? there is a good indication by other devs that this will eventually snowball into bigger p2w mechanics. There is also a concern that they might tweak the game so items break more often, or cost more to repair eventually making the repair kits a bit more appealing for players. We've already seen them lower the time it takes for something to spoil, nerf  the damage output of Two Shot weapons and the legendary drop rate
---
As for actually needing the kits there was one i could have used one
---
Got pulled into a long battle with SBQ while in the Excavator PA. Since my Gatling gun was over 100% when i started, it ended up braking towards the tail end of the fight and my right leg got destroyed so i was also over encumbered. I had to meander over to a PA station, repair my leg, then run off to Fast Travel back to my base to repair my gun and then back to to the battle. 
---
Beyond this i never had a need to use it beyond my own stupidity of not checking my guns
---
Not to mention it's way quicker to switch to a different weapon on fav than use a repair kit.
---
Ok thank you
---
I just want to keg. 😭
---
Ah well, looking forward to getting stuck in! Ty!
---
Ummm what? Open your eyes there are entire threads basically devoted to this.
---
Paying real money is against tos and should get ppl banned.
---
But two wrong do not make a right.
---
Well let's play and see, i really hope the repair kit weight a lot, so it avoid carry a lot and also stock a lot on stash
---
Thanks for the help
---
No one cares about THEMSELVES paying to win, they just don't want someone else to be able to.
---
Sound the horns and sharpen the fangs
---
Hard to tell. Because Atoms themselves can be purchased.
---
Could always do what i did and place them with the Deathclaw pelt rug, to show what became of mama.
---
And honestly, that at least is fair. But it would have had to have been something easter related- so unless it was an Easter Deathclaw I can see why they opted for the bunny head.
---
A person and I got into it when the outfits came out about the "you can earn them in game" I'm at work so pardon if my numbers are off but you can earn about 700 atoms a week doing dailies and weeklies. And around 8-12k Atoms from the scaling challenges (the ones that increment from 20,40 etc.) It's a very wide shaped funnel that we're circling but the main goal is for us to fall back into our pockets.
---
The issue is you're mixing up two different items 
---
Basic Repair Kits, available in the atom shop only repair to 100%
---
Advanced Repair Kits which repair to 150% are NOT available in the atom shop and can only be had as rare drops from completing in game content.
---
I agree that is probably what has happened. Not the best long term decision though.
---
Really? Never paid attention to that - gives me even more reason (not that any was needed) to murder more Super Mutants, cheers amigo :)
---
Ten your stuck going on your mule picking up a couple of your millions stable flux to repair, finding a friend to "hold the server" and switch over. You're right, this sucks.
---
Can confirm, getting same error code.
---
Only possible outcome.
---
Careful skinny, you're gonna start a howl

Did you drop an /s ? Or can you just not meme

Third party sides are THIRD PARTY and thats why they can do it. Its hard to stop them, and its not allowed. I really dont get this comparisson, its like saying "when a thief steals its ok". No its not and Game devs can hardly stop its, cause lawsuits are expensive and take ages.
---
18+
---
Yea but the locations I hit up for the cans get me like 250 steel in 10 mins
---
No worries dude, they also sell for a shitload unscrapped. Happy hunting!
---
The kegs files are already in. Should I do a post for all the new atom shop stuff too?
---
And rightfully so. I may hate the repair kit fiasco but if they did that i’d start a riot
---
I usually vendor the ones I don't use, will be putting them up for sale come player vending.
---
Just holding one of each until we can sell stuff lol
---
Ohhh my God. So relieved by reading all these comments :D
---
I'm sorry, but quite frankly, your response to the repair kit feedback is bullshit.
---
The community at large did exactly what you guys have always asked for, and gave tons of feedback, to the point where this subreddit was literally all posts about why we didn't want repair kits in the atom shop. And your response is "thanks but we're gonna do it anyway and we'll change it maybe sometime if we feel like it"
---
Seriously? You guys don't have the goodwill to do this. You had a terrible launch, and you still have a game filled with bugs. 
---
How many community suggestions are going to be turned into atom shop exclusive items? How many quality of life items are going to go straight to the atom shop? 
---
All this really does show is that you guys couldn't care less about the concerns of your players, rather what makes money. As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason to make suggestions or give any sort of feedback anymore, because it's clear you guys don't care. You'll pick the suggestions that'll make you money, you'll fix the things that'll cost you money, but past that it's clear you couldn't be bothered.
---
I'm trying to stash one of each in the hopes that eventually they'll update the game to include the ability to display them properly in your C.A.M.P. I'm really close to having all the mags, but the U.S. Training Manuals are tough ones to find from my experience.
---
It’s not just armor I believe it repairs weapons too
---
[](/tempestgaze) That is what 2 shot MIRV fatman launchers are for.
---
The trade reddit technically has a policy against real money trades but on the dupe hayday the big sellers would regularly post images of their gear that were just images of an address leading to pay sites.
---
no, the Endangerol syringer is used on the SBQ, no one uses the Karma syringer
---
&gt; What are the rest of you doing with them?
---
Waiting for a display stand and camp decoration to be implemented
---
I don't know how many times I have been set upon by completely invisible ghouls at the WS clubhouse
---
A Recent, Favorites, or Most Frequently used sort for SPECIAL cards would be the greatest quality of life addition I can think of.
---
If you’re lvl 200+, leave the n00b5 alone.

Take a picture of a cave cricket mid air while in pvp during a radstorm naked with 20 charisma and shooting a full health tse handmade
---
Nah I'm with you bud. Im just strolling around the wasteland and enjoying the view. Guess there's just a lot of e-sports players here that are the most vocal. I respect their opinion about the repair kits, but I myself cannot possibly be bothered by them.
---
Stop talking common sense lad and join the rage against the 'kit' movement
---
My stash is full of 2 and 3 star legendaries, waiting for the Legendary vendor so I can finally open some space up...
---
Is everyone here wanting to find out how? Or are you just here to hear my SOOOTHING VOIICEA
---
I keep bobbleheads that are relevant to my play style but only a couple of each magazines I’ll pick up but if I don’t see a use for the effect I’ll drop it in the watoga suitcase just in case someone needs it to complete the magazine challenges
---
I'll have to test when I play tonight,  thank you.
---
Xbox store has atoms to buy... I’ve seen some really decked out camps full of everything in the atom store. 
---
I get what players are saying I just don’t think it’s going to effect a lot of players overall. 
---
Players saying they’re gonna I uninstall and walk away is a joke... not gonna happen. They’ll be here.
---
Bobbleheads like caps I use regularly, but yeah, same issue with not thinking about them when I really need them. I tend to sell the bobbleheads and drop the magazines in blue suitcases around the world, along with any plans I already know.
---
Notes say they can’t be dropped, trades, or sold
---
That's still pay to win even with caps
---
It absolutely is an advantage. If I'm farming West-tek and my shotgun breaks, and I'm surrounded by super mutants and can't get through the door because they are too big and blocking it. So I can't fast travel or get to a workbench to repair that item. One of these kits absolutely would be an advantage as I could repair it on the fly without needing to get to a workbench.
---
Also, the only thing that drops the "better version" is the SBQ and it is listed as a RARE drop form her. So it will drop off her about as often as those rare plans people struggle to get her to drop, and even worse they are a single use consumable.
---
To code this easier, I would recommend a different button to purchase with the primary button being to view.
---
Example: on PS4 X to view, circle to back out, square/triangle to purchase
---
Place a hard limit on the mail weight like 50 lbs.  big enough to send that heavy weapon but small enough that you arent creating a massive second stash
---
In survival mode a back and forth between 2 decent teams can go on for a long time, and my team pretty frequently stays in the thick of it until we have to retreat because our weapons are breaking.   If all we had to do was cover each other long enough to pop in and out of the pipboy we could stay much longer and reap more caps and chems. 
---
 I didn't even need to come up with a hypothetical.  This happened 2 days ago.
---
Oh I know they're there. It's taunting me from the C.A.M.P misc section. I saw a Bethesda employee say in a thread it was a reward for a challenge that hasn't been implemented yet..
---
I want it.
---
😞
---
It's never going to stop because they will cry and complain until they have it their way. Sounds like they are spoiled at birth. I'm used to getting what is given to me. So I just suck it up. Wish the world was the same. If I need something I try to work around d it or figure something out to make it better.
---
Did they "over emphasize" reddit input? I don't spend a lot of time in the Internet forums so I don't know if they have cited reddit influence one way or the other. My guess would have been they simply pick and choose the ideas that they think will serve their interests.
---
 So not bending to the will of complaints they read in reddit-land doesn't mean they are ignoring anything. They have made a calculation on what serves them and if sales drop so low they suffer they will adjust their tactics or go broke. If you seek guidance from, and alter course constantly based on the loudest noises on the internet you will develop nothing of value.
---
This! I go to Big Bend for Steel \[scrapping scorched weapons too\] and Lucky Hole. Best way!
---
I'm feeling my adrenaline begin to surge
---
I've got 6 plans (3x45, 2x51, 1x60) from my last 8 SBQ kills (1 plan per kill). I've been wanting a Prime Handmade plan. Also I'm in Excavator.
---
You think this is bad?
---
Man I miss the WoW official forums. Now those guys knew how to WHINE.
---
3 days? WTF. I've been turning in 3-4 per day for over 4 weeks and haven't gotten a single paint. I just got my first science scribe outfit today too.
---
A space station should be fairly rad resistant, glue it to the mountain using some *Bethesda Lore Magic^tm* and there you go, makeshift vault-ish place.
---
I like you :) Wil you be my friend? ;)
---
I'd rather they first create some decent content to justify monetization rather than the other way around.
---
I have no doubt they are making a pretty penny as it is from the Atom store - yet what is being delivered us hardly worthy of monetization.
---
I've paid twice as much buying cosmetics on Fallout 76 than I did buying all the DLC in fallout 4, and the only real content I've seen so far is even more items to purchase in the atom store.
---
With that in mind - I feel the way forward is to wow players with decent and lasting content, thus justifying the atom store.
---
The repair kits are flat out pay-2-win and I am not even considering pvp.
---
Repair kits now let me farm less often by supplementing my game play with real money. Why farm screws and springs and gears and and ballistic fiber when I can just throw dollars at the issue. I now have a bunch of extra free game time thanks to my bank account and I can now go and grind West Tek more for legendary drops and XP.
---
Players willing to spend money now have a distinct advantage in the game in regards to time investment vs rewards.
---
Yea me too lol
---
Personally I'm planning on selling them on the marketplace, but I keep forgetting to add them to the list ;)
---
I do carry around me a str and an explosion bobblehead. The former for overload traveling, the latter for a little more ooomph when needed ;)
---
As I said elsewhere, you are wrong about those facts.
---
&gt; It absolutely is an advantage. If I'm farming West-tek and my shotgun breaks, and I'm surrounded by super mutants and can't get through the door because they are too big and blocking it. So I can't fast travel or get to a workbench to repair that item. One of these kits absolutely would be an advantage as I could repair it on the fly without needing to get to a workbench.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Also, the only thing that drops the "better version" is the SBQ and it is listed as a RARE drop form her. So it will drop off her about as often as those rare plans people struggle to get her to drop, and even worse they are a single use consumable.
---
You can disagree with friends. You'll learn that later in life.
---
no matter what, there will always be some market for buying items
---
yeah but if I traded my weapon to him and he gives it back after repairing it, that's a problem and that's an advantage
---
Yeah I like having a reason to go back to my CAMP
---
Plus like, this is why i carry like 6 weapons on me at any given time, so if I dont want to or can’t go back to CAMP for a while I can just switch to a different weapon for a while
---
Did the purchased items get removed?
---
The pvp is horribly balanced. What you suggest gives the whales more time to out gear you while you grind mats and repair, still changing the meta.
---
&gt;rare
---
we have enough rare shit.
---
People might aswell buy the atom shop ones as the incentive is you dont have to do quests or events to have a slim chance of getting one.
---
dont you see this is the classic case of "Why try and get something better thats free but really hard to get in the 1st place when theres a paid one thats almost as good?"
---
people with less time or that want the advantage will pay for the atom shop ones because its easier to come by rather than trying your luck at an event that takes 10-15 minutes to do
---
Bethesda has nothing to do with a 3rd party selling stuff for real money. there's a huge difference here, so much it's not even related.
---
You're not supposed to tell everyone. There's enough competition to get them already :D
---
Agreed but it literally happens and haven’t seen anyone complaining about that. Even when people were duping all that and more was on eBay. Those items didn’t disappear... buyers still have them.
---
Just make sure you're overrepaired 😂😂
---
You comment here all the time, but you always display only a superficial understanding of this game. Needing to spent weeks looting ammo bags to repair your stuff?? Seriously, you either don't actually play or your purposely being misleading.
---
WaNnA fIgHT?!?!
---
Oh gotcha
---
Hehe. Add me on PS4 if you are on it. Name is the same.
---
literally it isn’t because caps can’t be bought with money. do you even know what the term “pay to win” means?
---
Same here. The ultimate compliment for one of my Camps is “I didn’t realize this was a camp”.
---
I for one have broken a gun in the middle of a fight, and could see benefit of being able to repair in the field so I can use that gun to finish the fight - then when I can get to a repair bench I can repair back up to 200% - 
---
that being said, it doesn't happen often enough for me to buy them from the atom shop - ill save my atoms for that Blackbird PA skin when they bring it back (fingers crossed), or when they have a more appealing skin for combat armor...
---
It'll buy you maybe 1/2 a second against automatics.
---
[](/krockhooflaugh)Funny you mention it, my fat man is always breaking in the middle of fights. A real bummer that repair kits aren't craftable, that's pretty much what I was going to use them for. That and my 2 shot homing missile launcher.  
---
Ah well, I'll get over it I guess.
---
Exactly.  You should NEVER be carrying just one weapon and for events there’s usually enough warning to hit a stash and pull out the “big guns” you like to use for bosses.
---
Hell you probably even have enough time to swap cards and 200% your gear in some cases (SBQ nuke drop).
---
There is ZERO reason to buy these things.  DO NOT encourage Bethesda with this shit.
---
I respect that! I just see Bethesda doing the same for this game as they have done with ESO... like the ESO Plus. 
---
I don’t get the rage... let them quit if it upsets them that much.
---
Not really. After level 60 or so (to account for getting all the perks you need) you gain no advantage by gaining more levels. In fact you start to lose it since PvP will eat more of your caps.
---
That's good to know, but I have little to no use for flux.  I don't care about mutations, I have one set of PA that I use that's already modded out, and I don't use prime receivers.  
---
I just sell the unstable flux I grab when I leave.
---
I'm startled my baby laughing so hard at this one
---
I’m a melee build so don’t keep much lead...usually between 50-100. However, I have hundreds of springs...I stopped collecting them at 500, but still manage to end up with more 🤷‍♀️
---
It's their game, their creative vision, we shouldn't try to influence the direction of art.
---
lol... so salty...
---
I have over 30 bobbleheads for occasion on which i always forget to use them. The other 80 or so weight of magazines are for when i'll be able to display them, and the already mentioned occasions.
---
Trying to find where on earth I read it now. Diving into my history. I'll edit this comment with the link when I find it.
---
As i explained, This grind for people without guarenteed kits means more time for those with them to grind legendaries, if youre running the same perks. That's still an advantage.
---
&gt;You get better kits when you kill high level bosses
---
Nope, it is a rare drop by ONLY the SBQ, just like those rare plans she can drop. You aren't going to be able to farm them and get a stash of them. They are going to be rare drops from only the SBQ.
---
&gt;You get free atoms daily + weekly through playing the game and completing in-game challenges
---
Also no, they have been putitng in harder and harder challenges, to the point they have repeatedly put in challenges that are literally impossible.
---
&gt;There's no one forcing you to buy these kits
---
Wait till they change the cost of repairs, or how often you have to repair. They have been nerfing the repair perks for a while, and have made it even harder to repair now by having to go multiple levels into your UI, when prior it could be done right at the workbench without having to go into inspect.
---
&gt;Do all of those ring true? 
---
Nope, already pointed out where you were wrong on about half of your claims.
---
The big issue is that they lied to our faces.
---
Mine disappeared after faschnact update..still on console but no way to get them back in game sadly
---
"Stability: Fixed an issue that could cause the PC game client to crash after exiting to the desktop from the Main Menu."
---
Oh boy, I think I can finally close the game normally now!
---
Exactly. 
---
"They're going to pay to save on materials!!!!!"
---
Are they? Are they really. That's alot of cash to save on stuff you just get by playing.
---
Don't give them any ideas
---
[](/dwhurtdoc)I just use mine to clear trash mobs in queen fights. I don't worry if it breaks. If two miniguns, a gatling gun, a plasma gatling, a LMG, an axe, an auto grenade launcher, a two shot rocket launcher, a ton of grenades, and two different flavors of shotgun don't get me through a big fight then I am pretty much toast anyway.
---
Yep
---
Faster exp = faster perks = easier to re-spec and fine-tune your build.
---
And even not counting that, you said **after level 60 or so**.
---
That's a lot of levels.

This. The in-game album is a separate layer. Deleting from in-game does not mean your picture is gone. All images are stored on your hard drive.

If only there was a way to re-add some of those pictures...
---
Ha! Nice! Happy hunting! lol
---
Why not just use them? An hour of +1 strengh is many times better than 15 caps.
---
so you're ok with the lowest possible effort approach? you don't mind them shamelesly trying to monetize every possible venue?
---
no wonder gaming is in this sorry state. you wouldn't mind if Fo76 went full gacha apparently.
---
Hooded rags
---
The real issue with repair kits is that now condition degradation, junk rates, and related things are now tainted. 
---
  If, for example, heavy guns degrade faster and/or need more junk to repair, was that a game balance decision, or a revenue decision?  We won't know for sure.
---
It may not be pay to win, but it lets the accountants have a say on game design and thats not where they belong.
---
Horse armor is much more cosmetic and not part of an online game. I have less of a problem with that tbh.
---
A week? Ha! Maybe a couple of nights. The .50 cal noms ammo.
---
fortnite has the exact same issue, and both answers are the same. hint: it starts with M and ends with oney.

Those entries are there since the last patch I think. But they are not ready, and the voices are not there yet either (for the most part)

You got my hopes up.

On an unrelated note, how do you get to have special icons next to your username?

????????????????
---
I agree, there is no coming back from that...
---
"If we find that Repair Kits do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that advantage is removed."
---
Yet they fail to realize that this is paying for the ability to circumvent having to gather and spend resources to make repairs
---
In my opinion yes it's still pay to win with the in game currency. Buying something like OP weapons and armor is ptw to me.
---
Dont be so sure - people said the same over on the Anthem subreddit - and it's happening.
---
People over there defended the game for weeks and weeks, but the lies uncovered and its disrespectful treatment of its player base did not help one bit.
---
Anthem is dying a painful death and I think it's fair to say it's now on life support.
---
Fallout 76 is still standing - and can become an amazing game if handled properly.
---
I have no problem with repair kits being in the atom store, but I worry about what comes after once this is accepted and becomes the norm.
---
Also you are right - nearly every camp i come across is decked out with Atom store content - so the store is certainly turning a tidy profit - so I feel now is the time to start turning out all that free content we were to get that would be funded by the atom store.
---
For someone to deck out their camp, they would be paying nearly twice (or more) the price they would have spent on all the DLC combined in Fallout 4, which was pretty good content adding hours upon  hours of additional playtime and story.
---
That is the type of content that is badly needed in 76, something that keeps us busy unlocking new areas, solving new mysteries,gearing up to fight  new bosses etc. 
---
If the content being pumped out was good content, then I'm all for pushing the atom store.
---
But as is, I dont feel players tha  spend any money in the atom store to support a game they clearly enjoy are getting a good return for investment when it comes to the entire purpose of the atom store, which as we were told was for content to be built.
---
I am 38 actually.
---
If you think there is a chance in hell they'll actually remove it you're a moron
---
That's why I said I vendor the ones I don't use, or just leave in the cash register near the White Spring Bulk vendor.
---
So your claim if you pay for anything with any currency it is considered pay to win?
---
You don't know what pay to win means then.
---
And I'm free to point out that if BGS listened to the community even half the time this game would be a disaster. It'd make the launch look like a well oiled machine. 
---
Game communities have over inflated impressions of how valuable/viable their feedback is.
---
Most of my friends who are also whales are feeling the same way. As I said elsewhere, bethesda thinks those of us who fall under "whales" are dumb and easily manipulated. We aren't, this is clearly a cash grab and shows zero respect to us as players, so I sure as shit won't be rewarding some company that has no respect for me. I know my friends also feel the same way.
---
So if we go by the amount my friends and I have spent on games like LoL and PoE I alone have probably spent close to 3 grand on skins between those two games, and my friends aren't far off from those numbers. So yeah, by pulling this shit, they are actually hurting their bottom line, not making more money.
---
Stop calling him over this sub , his the best lurker , don’t give your opinion on him because he doesn’t take it nicely
---
Ok cool thanks
---
It's the butthurt reddit basement nerd warriors that are crying. No one else gives a fuck about repair kits lol.
---
"they even glow in the dark! Get yours now!
---
Damagecausedbyradiationtotheeyesisexpectedcomtactyournearestdoctorforthreatment"
---
They have made mistakes but this one there is no denying.
---
You did not make me!!!
---
I agree. I don't PVP though, so I do understand why PVPers might be worried about future developments. I wish they would add some more armor and weapon skins, so I could find something to buy. How about just solid colored paint for starters !
---
I think it kind of sucks cryo didn't get more love. Imo it has one of the best models in game but is pretty underwhelming. I've seen people saying it helps a lot for those two fights but I haven't tried it yet. How long does the freeze last?
---
So some players are fine with buying armor and TSE’s but repair kits are off limits..?
---
You are not the target. You have the perks needed to mitigate repairs. Most casuals are barely post 50s. This is designed to keep them playing, not playing the repair game. Get over yourselves, it doesnt give an advantage other then time. Quit complaining because someone else told you it was unfair. Think for yourselves. Its no where near p2w. Tired of your millenial twats complaining because a youtuber did.
---
There is so much misunderstanding here about how a business works. If you want new free content for this game, you better hope that somebody is buying Atoms.
---
Just film 5 naked intoxicated mothmans in clown suits while they using player-owner shop in radstorm while on chems
---
Look I was going to take a photo of a drunk naked guy on Chems but I didn’t feel like talking to my neighbour. I’ll get tomorrow’s atoms instead
---
Their not forcing you to buy the repair kits if you play smart and bring a extra weapon you dont have to buy one they are just saying if you need a repair kit then here they are stop bitching about it
---
They r not cosmetic which is what we were promised the atom shop was for.
---
Everyone is wrong. 
---
This community rarely has good ideas or opinions.
---
hold tight. Wambulance inbound
---
Lol oops
---
But you're moving the goal posts. People are really upset that their community PR guy said "only cosmetic" and this isn't.
---
Phew I was worried about you.  I'm glad you made this post
---
Most people will just use Materials ...
---
Pretty sure they want caps or there returning once the game isn't that broken
---
Is the pool deep enough for underwater power armor battles?
---
Who are you?
---
I know. That's what I was saying.
---
[](/celestiawarfare)Oh, same here, bear arms truly is a blessing isn't it? I can't wait for them to fix the ammo crafting for the flamer. I've been carrying the same explosive one since launch week waiting.  
---
You mention shotguns, what strength perks to you run? I can see a grognaxe doing serious pain no matter what, but I have trouble making shotties, and big guns both good.
---
Nope.
---
Sane Person -- well then they should use the perks that let them repair stuff to 200% and reduce weapon and armor degradation rates like anyone normal does.
---
Loading into Whitesprings like "is it nuked, or is the grass still loading?" The loading lag that makes the whole world orange is particularly unnerving.
---
Go check Watoga for Legendary Robots
---
Someone missed their Drama class this week.
---
They promised that there would only be cosmetic items, is a repair kit to repair your items cosmetic?
---
Well if I ever spent $ on Atom Shop stuff, this might do it
---
Hey "a friend " got their account banned "and they did nothing wrong " how many repair kits will they need to purchase to fix their account?
---
You can troll all you like but I least have the courage to put my feelings out there.
---
Having 3 would be great, then we can have a proper prey for my hunting party!
---
Just one less paying gamer.
---
Easy there. No need for name calling
---
Bethesda I wanna like you. Fo76 is really fun and sadly an underrated game. I got it not even 2 weeks ago and I'm addicted. But stuff like this makes me shake my head and go, "what a shame." There's like some disconnect between the devs who I can tell are passionate about Fallout versus the suits who just want to increase profits. I for one won't be purchasing anything from the Atom Store with real money due to this. Bethesda seems bent on ignoring player feedback and its really destroyed their reputation recently. You can do much better.
---
Nice move bethesda.
---
exactly...
---
I kind of worry that things will suddenly start breaking faster in an attempt to drive up demand for repair kits.   White Knight isn't what it used to be.
---
&lt;3
---
You’re missing the big picture , buy 16 of those and you could had a skin just saying
---
Can you show me the relevant code for the pipe revolver and bolt action? I'm curious as to why they seem special. I couldn't get double dipping to work on a regular pipe pistol.

---
&gt; Nothing to look forward to at all
---
Well, apart from two bug fixes for extremely irritating bugs.
---
Did you earn something yourself? Or did you buy it to get an advantage? 
---
If it has an advantage and you win more and it cost you anything (atoms/caps/cash) you literally paid to win in some form. 
---
You also bought the game and still playing right? Are you quitting and uninstalling the game? No probably not... Bethesda just won even more.
---
Let’s see last patch there was no hot fix ( assuming due to easter holiday ) but almost all previous patches after 2 work as update and hot fix the following day
---
Ya, i will admit that it can affect gameplay for many players but for hardcore players, it actually very much worse for them to use repair kits, they repair only up to 100% and they have so much resources that they drop them, sell them, or just straight up give them to other players, and honestly, people blow things way out of proportion, yes there is the question of “whats next?” But what bothers me is the ridiculous people who act like they are eventually going to be able to pay money for the exact legendary gear they want. Thats not going to happen because bethesda knows that that would be clearly p2w and would lose so many players in a heartbeat
---
QQ. GL HF.
---
Yes- I actually look for this as I'm server hopping Whitesprings. I check the plants near the enclave back entrance- if they are glowing, I go around once and kill for one loop.
---
Repair rapier rapper.
---
Ima just pretend I never said anything...
---
You would be wrong.  The number of people that buy for real money is much less than the number that just trade on reddit which is already a ridiculously small number of people.
---
Could you clarify what you mean with the Fallout 3 reference? There was a hard level cap of 20 or 30 with DLC. You definitely did not get to choose a new special point every five levels after that.
---
I just put it on my t51.
---
I honestly have no interest in them either and am quite happy to repair my own stuff to 200% as I've been doing up until now.
---
Repair kits have never been the issue though - it's what may follow that has had people worried.
---
The bug that your AP Points goes lower and lower
---
I have pulled out all alcohol, water everything that showed in the fermenter.
---
Only thing in my aid tab is bobbleheads and magazines
---
Haven't tried adding into the stash and taking back out though if that's what you mean.
---
I got my money’s worth (over 300 hours), I won’t be investing further (atom shop) or future expansions.
---
Yes you do that
---
That would be awesome, I'll be online around 8:30-9pm Eastern time
---
Xx
---
People keep spouting out that it isn't P2W, but it sounds like the majority people are upset that a non-cosmetic is in the Atomic shop.
---
That's the kind of price I was expecting. Decent but it would basically eat up your daily challenge earnings.
---
paying In game currency?????
---
Malkovich? Malkovich!
---
Confirm with someone else, but I believe my husband got his from a glowing enemy in Watoga.
---
Yup If I was him I would be beyond annoyed for the position Bethesda puts him in. Ultimately he’s the one that has to answer the fans for the direction Bethesda goes. I don’t envy his job at all.
---
Bought atoms for the first time ever just to get the plague PA skin. That thing just looks too fucking cool
---
I will gladly buy Atoms for cosmetics or camp items. I am actually waiting for the Riders skins and a limited time return of Blackbird paint. What I cannot do is support something that sets an unfortunate precedent. The reality is the kits are trivial, it’s that it appears they are testing the limits of the player base that concern me.
---
Is the XZibit meme still a thing?
---
I am. Sorry if believing in a company that I have played all their games is an issue for you.
---
And troll all you want. Did u think I wasnt expecting comments like yours? Maybe have an original thought and think what this means for the game we all love.
---
Yea just wasn’t sure how perfumes would work for players that’s why I thought maybe honey beasts are more suitable
---
I doubt it will be needed.
---
I got all of them by just simply turning on and off my system after the new egg was released , looks like a petty attempt to make an article if you ask me
---
No way in hell I would pay 50 atoms for a one use consumable.
---
I actually agree, it's definitely not pay to win and calling it pay to win is just taking attention away from the problem, I just don't understand what you don't get about this. Nobody is mad about the repair kits themselves, who gives a fuck, it's the disregard for commitments Bethesda made to us the fans and what this means for the future of the game and the studio
---
Sounds like they are learning much from Vault-Tec
---
Have any pictures to share?
---
And your a generic whiner :)
---
*deleted*, they got him
---
Spoiler alert, there is no Santa Claus either.
---
You make a great argument, in that case.... haha
---
Last Patch was 2 weeks ago, and yes the hotfix was on Thursday ;)
---
Sure, they change. But I expect change within the terms advertised, not Vader telling me he altered the deal.
---
Thanks and there is no Easter bunny either.
---
Repair kits are like those roadside emergency jump start kits most of us keep in the trunk of our vehicle. We don't want to spend seventy or eighty dollars to have a thing like that but we know eventually it will be needed.
---
...more like Yao Guy
---
i'am completetly with you on this!

I heard 50
---
Dude, get a grip. It’s a game. Go hug your wife/partner or play with your kids. Go outside. There’s more to life than this.
---
Good lord you have some growing up to do...
---
It's because most people know to run fireproof and have a dense torso chest mod which negate nearly all explosive damage when combined. But maybe I'm wrong. I haven't seen anything to confirm this bug
---
Ty ty, sadly this the only way to send a message to the game companies.  No more future atom shop purchases from a lot of gamers who feel the same as I do.
---
Is it strictly cosmetic?
---
Server hop for daily challanges, man you are lucky !
---
My weekend consisted of server crashing and then get new challanges.
---
I thought it was okay what I like most about it is the fact that I get at least two to three three star legendaries down there.
---
That's a very diplomatic way to calm down the hysterical.
---
I agree, it does suck when ur weapon breaks while in combat but most peeps carry multiple weapons anyways. I just see no point in spending anything at all on a repair kit.
---
Gotcha thanks for the advice. 🤦‍♀️

Smell-o-vision!
---
Yet you are here commenting on my post. Maybe take your own advice.
---
I've got over 2,000 atoms right now, not a single one is going to repair kits. Why waste my atoms on that when there are outfits and camp items to buy? Ans hopefully some worthwhile skins for heavy weapons, Aviator (fatman) is too expensive and Chrome (minigun) is ugly.
---
Um...which is exactly what the Atoms are?
---
The mannequins are alive! And lonely...
---
I’m going to be repairing my weapons between shots, in Survival mode.
---
I wonder if you can screenshot them and save them on your Xbox or ps4.
---
I personally think he's before down voted cause that Rick Sanchez is a constant toxic poster. He's always a negative whine ass.

Got all 6 myself. If you missed the first one you can still get the mask, but if you missed the last one the black one you don't.
---
im sorry i scared u :’(
---
Would you accept the same things in Fallout for? Recuring monetization (besides the crappy creation club). I would'not. And i have paid for both games.
---
Gotta follow your heart.
---
If i knew for a fact we'd get far harbor like content from these i'd be fine with it. But I don't know that. I'm really seeing repair kits in 2 categories. Mechanically it's an advantage. In practice you may be right. 
---
It's like if Beth pooped his pants, whether he flicks it out of his pants or keeps it in his shorts i can still smell it. And it stinks. Id rather they stick to cosmetics and camp stuff.
---
What was wrong with mods? (I have a set of calibrated on my X01)
---
Didn't they also say atom shop outfits were available to find in game?
---
Apparently it was dropping from encryptid by mistake.
---
I understand that but we literally have thousands of players who have bought items and the duping which honestly I think was a developer leak since someone randomly doing it discovered it is virtually impossible. 
---
I thought they would keep PvP servers clean of any duped items by making players start over... nope.. instead you could transfer over. 
---
Fact is there is millions of duped items out there and no controls. 
---
If Bethesda cared they would have had a weight limit from day 1 and a limit to extra characters or accounts you could creat on the same Xbox but they didn’t. 
---
Just not sure why people are upset about this.
---
If Fortnite can make piles of money off cosmetics why can't Bethesda off of a paid game?
---
Wait. Did they actually add the repair kits to the game?
---
K, bye.
---
That's something else entirely. I'm pretty sure Bethesda's terms of service say something about selling in game items for real money.. but that isn't pay to win, it's breaking terms of service. People selling things for real money should be banned. Player trading isn't pay to win. It's exactly as Bethesda wanted it to work.
---
I bought something and they're changing the terms *after* they've had my money, am I not allowed to be pissed?  
---
They utterly fucked the release and the player base are the ones they are going to try and squeeze for the money they budgeted for.
---
why are you talking to me about being scared your the one who is scared of tiny little repair pack that end of the day arnt a big deal
---
Is it a limited time offer, or an addition to the shop?
---
Where is the best place in Whitesprings shopping centre to dump plans?  (Before I just dump them in Watoga train station)
---
There are so many shops and I never find a single plan in any containers?
---
I haven't really played since I finished all achievements (in early January) and I'm 150 or 160.
---
&gt;Also, PvP pretty much takes no caps now since they reduced the cap loss.
---
It's still a direct competitive disadvantage.
---
Oh, so what you are saying is, I have to change my build take points away from other places just so I can have the same advantage as someone who pays for these repair kits?
---
Thanks for proving they are p2w.
---
Yeah but church now has "optional" microtransactions every time they pass the collection plate.
---
Shitty
---
Lol it's fucking stupid dude. It's a slippery slope. Why would they ass anything that inpacts game experience? Honestly ask yourself, why isn't this being sold by robot vendors?
---
This is a fucking money grab in a $60 AAA game. Pathetic from the likes of Bethesda. This is EA level shit
---
Did it unlock from the regular Assaultron Head Plan? if so, then yea, the imposter one shouldnt have unlocked (or shouldnt have shown you the message that it did)
---
I think it was on the unoffical bug list by "someone" in the patch notes thread
---
Oh fuck, memories. That camp, 60lvl guys hunting lowbies. That place was lit.
---
Sounds about right.
---
... what? Since when is that a thing?
---
Yes. Does that mean Bethseda doesnt have to keep to their word?
---
Don’t be a shill. It’s a non cosmetic atomic shop item.
---
Wish i could help but its a school night any other time i just might be able to help
---
&gt;Admittedly, I reached the cap limit back when the Civil War Top Hat was a thing. If their numbers are any indication, I suppose the Marine Tactical Helmet is the new version of that. 
---
Maybe for people who don't want to craft shotgun shells. But it still uses one plastic for every ~29 caps you get from vendor. For 1400 caps that's about 48 plastic. 
---
&gt;Even when the SBQ dropped serum recipes, I sure as heck never got one and I've run her more times than I can count.
---
I haven't either, but then, I've probably done it less than 50 times total. Shame the game doesn't have an reward counter for that.
---
Or cards that allow you to repair past 100%. Maybe this is just my perception, but repairs aren't even that expensive when it comes to materials.
---
Hot springs?
---
Oh I always have stated that as the problem. I mean I don't think and never said it was P2W myself. At the same time anyone just ignoring this as "no big deal" also seems like kind of a fool to me.
---
All photos are stored in your Gallery on your hard drive, just a heads up.  They aren't in game but they aren't lost either.
---
Vulture
---
Cool. If you just say stuff it doesn't matter if that's what happened or not. You can even use heavy weapons as an example... If you keep saying they got a degradation nerf then people will start saying that instead of the of the condition buff they actually received.
---
Right.
---
I mean, I'm also not buying them but that's primarily because I repair shit myself to 200% and also see it as a waste of atoms, which I use for the cool shit.
---
Welp, the game was fun while it lasted. Guess I wont be getting elder scrolls six. I'll also be getting rid of ender scrolls blades too. I just support this scummy company any more.
---
Seriously I have CAMPed nearly 90 times and love taking progress shots of my Camps as I build. On Xbox I have not found a practical way to keep up with my documenting.
---
Don't be a name calling child.
---
And yea, kudos mate, you just saved me 1400 atoms
---
No, because it's not "the same advantage." Want to repair less often? Stick to your perks. Want to repair in the field or care more about DPS than repairs? Switch out your perks and either keep mats *or* pick up kits.
---
You're not "winning" jack by picking up kits, you're just choosing where you want to prioritize.
---
OK. this kind of worry I understand (not that we can blame them for trying to "maximize profit potentials"- business is business)
---
I didn't really understand the backlash against repair kits. I mean "stop shooting me for 10 secs while I fix this"- Or while trying to launch a nuke-"where-ever shall I find a weapons bench- they are so rare in WV?" (finds 2)
---
The advantage is not having to use mats/time to get to a bench and repair. Common, there are plenty of casual players like myself who will never have the time/atoms to get and use these. Hell I'm sitting here now with my highest level toon being 25, and I'm spending hours getting parts together for my first suit of excavator armor! And I'm still nowhere near my first SBQ or even Nuke. This is just a bit of a slap in the face, especially considering how repair kits have worked in previous FO games.
---
Spot on.
---
Whitesprings
---
eBay.
---
Think of all of those perk cards you can now never have to use because you can just buy Atoms!
---
Honestly... repair kits don’t effect me, not going to buy them either. If repair kits upset players that much enough to uninstall the game chances are high they’re upset over a lot more in game than just a repair kit! 
---
I’m hoping mod kit issue is fixed! lol
---
I know, but i have priceless memories i want to remember when i am waiting till game load.
---
It would come in handy for my favorite Grognak's axe, which still cannot be over repaired. But I really only think it's broken against the SBQ before I've had a chance to repair it. I do use more resources to repair it than anything else since it can't repair over 100%. 
---
I can also see repair kits beneficial at lower levels where you don't have access to fix it good, white knight, etc.
---
Exactly!
---
No. But feel free to stop by my place when Player Vending hits.
---
its ok red we all know your a fearmonger we get it
---
I'm just confused by 1 thing what was I suppose to say to your non reply to my argument? So I just pointed out how your upset that you have no comeback or no logical argument to come back with.
---
There was a post and vid warning people about this thief (turok 3d or something) stealing people’s items during a trade. The next day when I logged in, lo and behold he was standing right there at WS station with his buddies probably conning others again. Made me wonder how in the world is this possible, maybe there’s only a few servers in total???
---
And who are you playing against?
---
This response is like the reviews on Amazon that answer the product questions with "I haven't bought it, sorry."
---
I'm saying if both caps and atoms are gained by just playing...why do people have such heartburn over paying for something with Atoms vice Caps
---

Dumbass, of course your idiocy will get upvoted here cause it’s the game’s sub. But the amount of idiocy is just astonishing, only idiots are still playing this.

They were all in the store on the last day if you missed one

Exactly so why are people crying, atoms are so easy to earn
---
No, bitch moan and rage quit. Then ignore your rage quit when you think no one is paying attention so you can play again.
---
don’t blame me for Todd being so scary bud
---
Because caps are not real money.
---
i dont like power armor and if i dont use 6+ perk cards people that buy kits don't have to use, im at a disadvantage. Im repairing a lot more than you.
---
Hahaha😂 Bethesda is gona fix that 🙁
---
I AM ON THE FENCE ABOUT THE ENTIRE ISSUE.
---
I just like to be a part of things.
---
The only thing I can think of is repairing high flux cost items like the Decon Arch, and frankly, getting flux for what you need is stupid easy, so whatever. And if you are in PVP gameplay and your gear is not repaired before you get going, that's on you, you neener.
---
Enemy levels spawn based on the player that enters the area first.
---
Low level Whitespring is a highly sought after occurrence because of those damned Golfer Ghouls not spawning with high level players.
---
Servers are up
---
1. Because it means the full on lied and are now breaking a promise they made. A promise that was used to market the game.
---
2. Because it’s crazy how you manage to only need to repair every few days with that many hours. You must have quite a few weapons, or not use them often. I have 3 mains and they would all break in a few hours if I was playing the game properly instead of farming healing salve or whatever. Also imagine playing survival and your weapons break. Instead of having to take a beat and go repair them like intended, you can just whip out a repair kit and instantly repair them.
---
So can I have your stuff?
---
Bethesda doesn’t endorse buying shit on eBay! they’re not responsible for 3rd parties, how can you not get this
---
lol fearmonger your only proving me right
---
If there is a stealth nerf to durability I will definitely be done here , I'm hoping not , I really love this game , but the stealth nerds are out of hand, every patch the data miners have to get truth for us. They have been very dishonest as a company and shown great disrespect for the fans
---
Oh now you know lol. On your previous post you were guessing.
---
No u can still craft it
---
Everybody that isn't freaking out or quitting is a shill. You didn't hear?
---
Bingo, I need to select it on my phone, I've been lording it up using the YouTube app built into my TV. Going to have to slum it for a few days to prune out the dross.  
---
Much appreciated.
---
The factory for fallout 76 is call the converted munition factory that gives you infinite ammo but no fusion core,
---
but there can spawn t series power armor but not raider I think.
---
can you speak louder i cannot hear you
---
Additionally, refrigerators seem to be something that Reddit expressed, separating turrets from the build budget, backpacks, the legendary vendor, re-speccing characters, and a few other ideas. If you've been following the sub for a while, there were posts suggesting these things that pre-date their announcement as coming features. Given that there's so many additions that can be found as suggestions from Reddit, I don't think it's a logical leap to say they're listening to reddit.
---
I say they over-emphasize reddit input because some of the suggestions they seem to have taken from reddit are kind of a net negative. For example, limiting single shot damage for PvP completely unbalanced things for riflemen/gunslinger/melee builds. High DPS&gt;high damage in survival mode. Reducing cap+aid loss in survival mode has also pushed PvP primarily back into adventure mode.
---
I agree, I fix my own stuff better than a repair kit so not goi g to effect me at all. 
---
I posted a while back asking if people thought Fallout would be like ESO plus which players pay monthly to get extra benefits. People said no...
---
Seems like that’s where it’s going and much like ESO there are more players that aren’t effected by the plus side of it. 
---
I don’t think it’s a big deal at all honestly...
---
This u/bethesdagamestudios' post history is difficult to find a word for
---
that one is well worth the swap just for damage output. You have to run the luck repair one in combat for it to work.
---
😂thanks for the laugh.
---
And they fix it one hour after you will not be able to buy it anymore :D
---
Not a 200% kit.
---
I doubt they will give us true endgame such as instanced raids. Bethesda games are usually mediocre until modders add content. They are more about exploring and enjoying the exploration than grinding for better gear.
---
There are other things players are asking for that would sell.
---
This is what I’ve been saying. It’s not particularly pay to win but Bethesda said cosmetic only. Which is definitely not the case.
---
Same lmao, not intending to buy but i’ll still play. But Bethesda should know much better
---
I think the cement is for the 1 time use mortar and pestle you make in order to grind the razorgrain
---
Really? The ability to repair a weapon on the field is how you’re going to win? Go away troll.
---
 I have the black one
---
A big company wants even more money? Shocker! Your post won't change that you big man baby
---
I usually have the radio on once the music starts its usually good to go
---
why did you comment?
---
I’m holding out hope that the backlash will reach over 9000 but not holding my breath.  Just got some sick ass/sent to drop last night too!  Bummer!
---
You have to be an adult to play this game anyhow, kiddo
---
&gt;I get this is an unpopular opinion, but there are literally hundreds of other games that can fill the void in your life if this one just causes you anger.
---
Where you see anger, I see passion. People wouldn't get this vocal over something this seemingly small if they didn't care deeply about the game's long-term health. The reason everyone is shitting on Bethesda's decision to add convenience items to the Atom store is because of concerns over what this means for the long-term monetization plans for the game. Is this the shape of things to come? Spend Atoms you get by either doing inane, anti-fun, and sometimes impossible challenges or by paying real cash to get items that provide increasing amounts of "convenience" until they're no longer convenient but necessary? 
---
Principiis obsta, my friend. Those of us most outspoken against this shit are usually the people having the most fun, and we do not want this garbage spoiling what is by and large a really cool, enjoyable experience. It's not about the repair kits, it's what they philosophically represent that's the problem.
---
Just encountered my normal 48-62 ghouls
---
No. Most people don't care, and find the incessant whining about it irritating. Which leads to them siding against you, regardless of your message.
---
So basically, your complaints are the reason we have repair kits. Thanks a lot.
---
I love it, basically another whitesprings.
---
Are you in PC or are we in a different universe?
---
well arent you special! want a cookie?
---
lets see do I waste 50 cents worth of atoms on a repair kit or spend five minutes grabbing the supplies to repair the weapon ten times over. The choice is clear.
---
Positive note... I’ve met a lot of cool players here and online in the wasteland! It’s cool to run into players like that making the wasteland a better place! lol
---
I can't wait to be old and hide in my old peoples home with emulators. Complaining about media skinner box addiction.
---
Yeah, I'll keep this in mind going forward. I'm just used to being left alone in the standard world. It's really disgusting that a level 305 was preying on someone nearly a 10th of their level, to be honest, and basically is harassment and griefing. Bethesda needs to implement some sort of surrender system so that people in pacifist mode can immediately opt to let go of a contested workshop because it's clear to me that these people didn't want my workshop they were just killing me for fun/for caps. but yeah, I'll be making sure I carry only the bare minimum on me so I won't be so upset if I lose it from now on.
---
I got mine. All I had to do was pay attention and log out. But to be honest, the reward was not worth worrying about, and I bet you'll be able tog et it next easter
---
I didn't get the memo....
---
Some guys stole the fax machine and beat it with bats to Ghetto Boys....
---
That description is spot on for the definition of pay to win. Pay to win might not be literal for what it means, but that IS what it means. You don’t need to like it.
---
Buying repair kits that you can use to gain an advantage over other people in survival who don’t have them because they don’t or can’t spend money on the game is a great example of pay to win. You’re paying to win. It’s that simple.
---
I heard the base chassis was nerfed recently, which may be related. He's correct on the hazmat rad reduction.
---
Oh my god those are sweet!
---
Still waiting on the damn datamined handmade skins to ever drop though 🤦🤣
---
The rabbit plushies stack on top of each other. When i take workshops, i build 20 bunny high statues at them. Then when i leave the server or lose the workshop, its still there for someone else to see. That's how I justify buying it lol
---
Yeah and man I can respect anyone who has a different thought or opinion, I'm not one to throw punches, I understand the rage, but I'm not overly distraught over them. Am I upset? Yes I think so. Am I kicking and screaming saying a threat of "I'm quitting" which may not affect Bethesda greatly? Hell no, for what this game is, I love it, I just want to look out for it because with how TES Blades is turning out, and now this, I have a hunch that it's more zenimax calling the monetisation shots than Bethesda, since it's zenimax who has control over ESO and made most of the monetisation calls for that game, and they do benefit from TES Blades and Fo76...
---
English only
---
I'm going to do what someone suggested on my post and server hop until I find a barely populated world if I need workshops. That's basically what I was using it for, the plans, because it's cheaper than buying them. Someone explained on my post that these people were farming me for caps and didn't actually want it, they were contesting it long enough to kill me to steal my stuff, waiting to contest it again, killing me, and rinse and repeat. They shouldn't be able to do this. After the first 2 times of going back into the red area at the edge of the workshop, I stopped going in, and the still came and found then killed me. If they wanted it, they would have left me alone outside of the area long enough to let it switch over but they didn't, they just wanted to murder me for fn fun. I hate people.
---
Survival you fucking ape.
---
it's p2convinience, really. which is a slippery slope if I've ever seen one.
---
I **hate** farming ballistic fiber. and I'm sure I'm not the only one. so instead of spending a hour going around the map, relogging whenever someone already looted the bags and tapes, I could just buy a repair kit.
---
the proper way to tackle this issue would be rebalancing ballistic fiber as a whole. the sleazy approach is charging people for it.
---
I really like how after not only promising comestics only, but also after the game was released and everyone trashed on it Bethesda said we learned from our mistakes and will listen to the community more.
---
Then they decide to do something 80% of the community is against. Shows to me they won't learn from their mistakes and will continue making them.
---
Maybe you didn't update your game
---
Since launch...
---
good post - i think that a multitude of better cosmetic options is the way to make the atom shop more viable for me as a player.  I have purchased a couple of Atom bundles just to support Bethesda because I love this game, and will probably continue to do so, even though i don't see very much in the shop that i want... 
---
I don't understand why there aren't dozens or even hundreds of skins avaialble for PA and combat armor and weapons.  it seems like that is the model that works and what people want to buy.  Maybe there is some kind of limitation on the servers that limit the number of skins they can make available?  Not sure why they woudn't do this...
---
I have the perks that repair weapons/armor when you get hit/shoot something and if my armor breaks I just limp around defenseless for three hours until I find ballistic fiber
---
If XB, you'll need to clear your reserved space for FO76.
---
Nah
---
Rad Storm Challenges: Nuke zones now count toward Rad Storm-related Challenges, such as the “Kill a Glowing Creature in a Rad Storm” Daily Challenge.
---
Hahahaha, oh this guy. You’re funny I like you... creative vision. Oh the things people come out with.
---
Just a camera or the tourist that starts the mission ? Also where at the monument I was just there lol
---
Many of us play or at least pay attention to industry news enough that we've watched other games go through this and the slippery slope manifests fully into a microtransaction hellscape in the end.  
---
The writing was on the wall ages back with Horse Armor, but we always hoped Bethesda wouldn't give in to this kind of thing. Now we've got repair kits for fifty cents a pop, overpriced, time-limited Atom Shop skins and a Free-To-Wait Elder Scrolls game.  
---
Hoping time is over. The only way any of these companies get the message is if you pitch a big enough fuss and refuse to buy their crap (both literally and figuratively) on a large enough scale. Look what happened with Battlefront II and Destiny 2; enough people cause enough fuss that it hurts their wallets and public image, things change.  
---
Sure, it seems like a childish reaction on the surface, but individually, we have no power. One guy's mad and won't buy our stuff? Who cares? But when it thousands of people and they're getting articles published about how mad people are, sometimes results happen.  
---
Sure, it's no foolproof plan. But it's better than sitting there and taking it from a company you used to trust for the umpteenth time and hoping they stop.
---
um me too.
---
And if there will be one ill happily buy it
---
I really like the Bone Raider Excavator Power Armor skin they added.  That is a good example of the types of skins I would like to see added.  I would like to see Bone Raider variants for other Power Armor models.
---
The Scorched Sierra and Tribal Power Armors from past games are also good examples too.
---
No I don’t, so I can’t speak for the people that do, but in Adventure Mode I don’t see a need for them. I plan on checking out Survival this weekend though. 😬
---
Mine was a dead tourist laying on a bench when you climb the stairs. You have to search him for a holotape and it starts it.
---
Can we make it a black dessert instead? I haven't had lunch yet, and cake sounds really good right now.
---

That is my heavy loadout.
---
https://imgur.com/a/uxLAkxI
---
That is my shotgun/melee loadout (Wip)
---
Neither really designed for PVP, not my bag.
---
[](/lyragun)
---
Then it is not shown while loading tho
---
Could be; my example was only last week. I’d heard about the hidden % reduction on hazmat and power armor a long time ago, but never much detail.
---
Well, that can be fixed, by just having the turrets to shoot at the burglar, without that turret fire counting to initiate mutual PvP.
---
But yeah it's probably going to work the way you suggest.
---
I had the last 2 days level 62 *** legendaries one after another
---
You are most welcome 😊
---
There’s a difference between a contract you have with a company and a game developer changing the aspect of their game you paid to have a license to play.
---
Glad you had a good laugh 😁
---
Rad-X does suppress mutations. I did this purposely to suppress Marsupial when I was doing the agility course. It suppressed everything for a short period of time.
---
Diluted Rad-X does not suppress mutations.
---
Wasn't there for me
---
Well if you wanna go by the latter logic we celebrated Fasnacht in October too.
---
That said yeah its kinda goofy
---
Honestly, I dont even mean this in an aggressive way, I would just like to hear *their* side of all of this and the reasons why they are going back on past statments
---
I'll share if I get anything
---
If you stop to repair a weapon in combat, you're gunna die... that's a dumb argument
---
You missed the "for 24 hours" part of that comment.
---
I don't like this. Because I think you're right and that bums me out a lil. :(
---
I was just about to ask reddit how the other ones was looking with the skin on.. This should be much clearer in the description of it in the shop.
---
Eh, it’s not when a player logs off. I think it’s just when the cell resets? And there’s often players in the area of vendors,  so they don’t reset often
---
they are selling weapons right now in the atom shot. lol
---
I am quitting right this second!!!! 
---
Unless I decide not too...
---
Oh my God please not the Hunter/Hunted challenge again. Honestly at this point I firmly believe they’re trying to make the challenges too complicated on purpose.
---
I a actually missed the 40 atoms achole challenge at 24/25.
---
Thx Bethesda for helping me out for the next few..... Millenium
---
I just want bright neon colors for the excavator. Orange, green, pink? Maybe a set? Please?
---
Escape artist work only on very long distance, they fucked it up few patches ago
---
 Atoms can be earned in game so repair kit isn't ptw then?
---
People pay real money through other sources to buy in game items too. It’s the same damn thing. Except buying op gear actually give you an advantage.
---
Survival. Person A has repair kits, person B doesn’t. Person A instantly repairs their broken weapon midfight, person B loses because he doesn’t have any and relies on repairing at workbenches. Person A paid to win. Even if this wouldn’t be a thing, they still lied. They promised cosmetic ONLY. I don’t like liars. It means they don’t respect the community. If you don’t care about that, hey, good for you. Most people do.
---
I don't think so. Not in 2020 at least. They have have to add enough content for us to enjoy to keep everybody happy first. As it is now there is no meat on the bones, so to speak.
---
Their main source of income would be the Atom Shop, so there will be way more updates and new entries for that.
---
Gradually expanding the build limit for our camps will turn this game into The Sims.
---
Nice to see Bethesda putting in support for the Cybering community
---
People getting offended over the smallest things seems to be the trend nowadays
---
It was always datamined to be meant for the atom shop, it dropping as a plan was a bug
---
I only took the megastop because it was on my daily list. Otherwise I was back and forth exploring areas around it look for junk. I will be keeping the bare minimum junk on me (and I'm thankful I had stored quite a bit earlier in the night as it was, I just lost a fuckton of stuff when they murdered me). 
---
I didn't know to crouch, I literally just learned that tonight. I don't have a lot of caps and have even less now so fast traveling often isn't really affordable at the moment. Once I rebuild my caps, I will fast travel a lot if I've taken a workshop. thank you.
---
Thanks a lot my friend
---
Found nobody, was he in the parking area in front of the entrance ?
---
Happy to help, plus the more people doing this the less of this crap we'll see repeatedly
---
It’s still happening and it’s still pay to win.
---
I can confidently say that I do not feel sadness towards a game companies business decision because it is just a video game :') But carry on you're obviously a saint here to save us all with your brave words!
---
I get why people are mad and upset, I’ve been mad about not being able to place my mods on weapons and PA since the update! lol
---
Or upset about adding a prime receiver to the combat rifle only for Bethesda to change the ammo to something you can’t make! (Changes it from 45 to 44...) 
---
Fact that comments I’ve received even in a few dm’s are literally more disturbing than someone saying they will uninstall the game and quit... again over a repair kit! 
---
No game is perfect and everyone has to earn money someway and considering atoms have been for sale since the game came out is nothing new either... 
---
I do get if this is more a PvP deal! That would suck trying to kill someone with 20+ repair kits...lol
---
What car
---
It was a dead Tourist. Someone also said the found one at the Wavy Willard’s Water Park. It could be different on each server maybe?
---
They’ll one shot his camp by using repair kits 😂
---
You can get Brotherhood PA skins in-game.  They're rare rewards for the Technical Data quest.
---
I have the same bug
---
You’re on pc ? Custom something ?
---
I didn’t even realize I got it until I went into the power station to change to the Mothman paint...and there it was 🤪
---
Me too
---
If it does well I can see weapon repair kits being offered next.
---
The "refrigerators" were datamined as one of the backpacks we can build in a coming update.
---
Someone found one at the Wavy Willard’s Water Park. It could be different on each server maybe.
---
It does firecracker seem to be missing
---
I'll do that from now on. Thank you.
---
I wrote the post cited. You seem to have glossed over it and grabbed at the first quote, but in case you didn't notice, it's a much longer post with many other quotes. 
---
Here's one from Pete Hines: 
---
**"Atoms are used in our shop to buy  cosmetics things. So you know, new outfits or skins or things like that.  \[Things to customise\] your character to look unique from everybody  else."** 
---
He even repeats in the following quote that the cash shop will be about cosmetics and that Bethesda will not cross the line from that. 
---
Repair kits are not cosmetic things.
---
thanks bro I thought i had already updated
---
In survival we will have the option to insta repair broken weapons and items to win a battle when others can’t.
---
No, we don’t need them. But they help a player win, therefor making them pay to win. You fucking dumb cunt licking bitch.
---
Before we get outraged with Pete, remember that he's getting shafted here as well.  
---
Pete was told to inform us where the goalpost was. Months later, they moved it and made him a liar.
---
Thank I will do my best 👼
---
in the parking lot?  im not seeing him..
---
Thank you soooooo much
---
Going to try server hopping as he’s not showing up on mine!
---
The .25 lb weight equates to about 15 pages of copy paper. That makes sense for plans to build some objects, but a 15 page recipe seems pretty hefty.
---
On PC. I appreciate the offer though.
---
It’s just a plain armor piece. It counts as casual so to get any benefits you need the plans for any linings.
---
Rabbit mascot head. Automatically available at your armor workbench.
---
Oh yeah of course! Taking swapping for granted since I have the luxury of perk loadout manager.
---
Nothing at all, i don't care for it, that much i never even knew i had it
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!?!
---
I only have 49 caps, I was soooooooo close to finally being a winner!
---
I think the only time I got into a pinch without a descent back up, i just ran over to one of the dead super mutants and snagged his gun to let me finish off his buddies. Plus it let me us up some of the grenades I keep hording lol
---
Thinking perhaps it’s not a static location and might be just one of a few possible locations
---
Has there been a second photo gallery added just for the new camera?
---
This is excatcly the reason i dont understand how people think that repair kits are pay to win, anybody who explores just a little should have enough junk to repair stuff.
---
Yes they lied by saying there wouldnt be any gameplay enhancing stuff in the atom shop and i dont like it either but repair kits really dont make much of a difference from a gameplay perspective
---
And no im not one who justifys everything Beth does but theyre already in the game so theres not much we can do
---
no, no mods here.  just a bug im sure, but if these weeklies dont reset again until the next epoch ill be upset
---
&gt; we never asked for them 
---
"I never asked for them so therefore nobody did"
---
You're a shit troll
---
ITs preety much any tourist trap areas, like the water park, carnival ect
---
Yeah, I knew Firecracker Whiskey is missing. I wasn't sure about the cranberry though. I just have really bad luck I guess.
---
Great, another day of server hopping. Yesterday for Radscorpions Today for a corpse.
---
I’ve been defeated! I assume you paid for the repair kits in order to beat me.
---
I'll take 0 for it, just lemme roll a J up an boot the game up an i'll give it to you, i honestly don't value the item, fuck market pricing standards
---
A Ranger outfit would be awesome. Especially considering they pre-date the first Fallout. Plus who's to say they didnt spread to the east coast and just call themselves Wasteland Rangers? I'd like to see more Power Armor paints that are clean. I hate how you get the Nuka Cola Paintjob for the T-51 but its scratched and has rust. That makes no sense if you just painted it. It makes sense if you just found the Power Armor and it had been sitting for many years though. But if you do it yourself, that's not the case. I'd like to see more for the Raider Power Armor too. In FO4, one modder did a Raider overhaul that changes parts of the Raider Power Armor to look like certain pieces are made out of street signs. Looks cool as hell. Makes sense and is lore friendly. Bethesda need to get on that. Maybe they could allow some of the murders to release outfits somehow, since some of it is just cosmetic and shouldn't be that hard to add. I'd love to see Brotherhood hear from the Ad Victoriam mod added. I love they way that mod makes the Brotherhood look.
---
Make sure you wash your hands
---
Yes I have all of them but firecracker and I still try daily with the hope of it being super rare but I’m guessing it might be bugged
---
All - sorry if I upset any of you about my post, it was a question... not a dig or blast or hazing anyone either... it was a question... that a all.
---
free sign
---
The pool is small and is barely deep to cover the top of a players head, although the lake it's built on is wide and deep enough for some crazy battles!
---
Thanks for the reply, I do appreciate it but I'm not interested in talking about how screwed up it is. The wording of the perk card is not very plain. I want to understand the mechanics as intended. I'm not sure what you mean about working only over long distances. I just don't want to waste perk points on Sturdy Frame if I don't have to or waste mod slots on Muffled or Lighter build mods instead of Deep Pocketed if I don't have to either.
---
Probably same as the plague rider, where all models changes to the model shown in the picture. At least the unique skinned ones.
---
Yep, I will agree with everything you said there. It’s really disheartening when there’s a backlash met with absolute silence. They don’t know how to handle a fan base at all.
---
The bums will always lose. Do you hear me, Lebowski?
---
Consume the ones I don't need -- apparently there is a challenge. Or sell them to the vendor. They're too heavy for me to keep around. Save the ones I could benefit from and never remember to consume them lol.
---
[](/celestiawut)Oof man, only one charisma? That's hardcore.
---
Yup, PvE fo lyf. I haven't done a mutations build before but the new toon is planned that way.  I could certainly get Freak &amp; Starched in coming levels but starting to feel I'm too spread between demo and pistols.
---
Any word on how to find the corpse with a camera?
---
I get better grip on my controller if I don't.
---
Right when something along those lines would be awesome idk if Bethesda takes note from anything they see in Redit or anything else but let's hope they do lol
---
Here's the problem:
---
1) Todd said Atomic Shop will be COSMETIC ONLY.
---
2) Repair kits aren't a cosmetic item.
---
3) Repair kits are in the Atomic Shop.
---
4) Therefore, Todd lied.
---
End.
---
Time limit on anything?  What’s the sign?
---
Attacking people at workshops isn't being a "jerk" any more than killing someone on Overwatch is. You opt-in to PVP if you take one.
---
wow good catch
---
BUT IT IS MY PARENTS MONEY THAT BOUGHT ME THIS GAME AND I DEMAND ANSWERS NOW!!!!  /s
---
you had me at liberty prime. OMG WANT A LOT
---
Upvoted. Truth hurts.
---
Are you telling me that when people asked for the ability to repair items remotely that they meant "add a repair kit for me to buy for real money from the Atomic Shop"? No.  No one asked for that.
---
Still no fix for the audio issue. Can barley hear anything out of my tv when a headset is not plugged into the controller. Changing the voice chat mode to team use to fix it but now nothing does. Getting really annoyed with this :/
---
 [https://streamable.com/dmdck](https://streamable.com/dmdck)  Has been an issue since the games release
---
Holy shit, you're awesome dude. My GT is ActualGarbage68, just shoot me a message on Xbox. I'll be home in about twoish hours if you don't mind holding it for me, please
---
Had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
restricted area or something, probably for the next day or week
---
Don't like losing aid items on death. No thanks.
---
You can purchase a bathroom pass that pauses your game for you in the atomic shop!
---
Oooh Champagne.
---
Scary different kinds of weapons.
---
Second at colonel Kelly monument. Suggest server hop
---
58
---
That’s the reddish one from the datamine, right?
---
Pretty sure none of those people wanted them to be an Atomic Shop only item, though.
---
A friend and I attempted to do the sheepsquach quest with just the 2 of us and got demolished 😆
---
58??58 what?
---
Lol on my second hop now
---
Someone said wavy Willard’s parking lot. I’m traveling to uncanny caverns to check there
---
I play on PC and am almost amused when I climb my partial built camp when its loads in.    Although disappointed with bugs, I still enjoy this game and wouldn't mind a longer load screen if it remedied this problem.  I hope they continue to add content to make the world "less lonely".
---
flaming broom mod- chase the guy in the scarecrow outfit around.
---
Next day or week?  You’re killing me.
---
It's not going anywhere i've had it for weeks and just not cared for it, never posted it anywhere neither so yeah, it's 100% yours
---
Survival. Repair a broken weapon mid battle while your enemy has to go find an armour bench, go through the animations and repairing crap and come back.
---
Thank you. You made my day. 😂
---
I plan on using all of my available atoms to purchase repair kits
---
yes
---
Its OP when there is only 2 counters that actually work frequently. Tesla (which needs to be quad and super up close or it wont do enough damage) and explosive or bloodied laser rifles (that also people need to know they have to beta wave reciever and beam splitter mods and tank killer) you can still do it with explosive assault rifles but you NEED to have tank killer or you will never stagger which means youll never kill. And shotguns with enforcer dont do enough damage so theyre only useful if you have multiple people on your team to hit them while you stagger them. Now theyre invis so people cant bypass with crits and unless you know literally all the tricks (which most people dont) its gonna be super OP. Are you getting this yet?
---
how? you not on?
---
Not to mention the penalty for death is still incredibly light so even if they did manage to kill you you'd basically just shrug it off
---
This again?
---
They are not. They have said this regarding it:
---
&gt;First, thank you to everyone in the Fallout 76 community who took the time to share their feedback and concerns about adding a utility item like Repair Kits to the Atomic Shop. Over the past couple weeks, we’ve examined all the feedback and today we want to share our thinking when it comes to these types of items and how they relate to the Atomic Shop. When we originally announced the Atomic Shop last year, we said that it will not provide anything that offers a competitive advantage. We remain committed to that statement and take it into account when we evaluate every new item that we bring to the Shop, both now and in the future.
---
&gt;While Repair Kits do offer a way to fix an item in the field, we feel you will find that they are a convenient option you can utilize during your adventures. If we find that Repair Kits do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that advantage is removed.
---
&gt;Aside from purchasing Atoms, you can also unlock Basic Repair Kits using Atoms you’ve earned from Challenges. Additionally, the more powerful Improved Repair Kits will not be available in the Shop and can be earned by completing in-game content, like killing the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
TL;DR - We've listened to community responses and will adjust kits based on actual performance in game.
---
Some say the big alligator. A body next to a car, but not always there. I would check tourist spots for a body.
---
Not for the next two-three days.
---
filthy casual.  That's what a Vita and remote play is for.
---
I know. I read that and there was a click in my mind of a paradigm shift.
---
Thank you so much man. Shoot me a message on Xbox when you get on, if you don't mind, and I'll see it when I get home and join you
---
It's marvelous to snag 400 lbs of junk off of someone at a workshop :P
---
Nice! Been waiting to add mine!
---
You know what I love most, you contradict yourself so often in your own reply. You played yourself.
---
This is the new Bethesda team. Hopefully no one is surprised... since the game came out thats been the basic go to for Bethesda.
---
400 lbs is 181.6 kg
---
The unlock was a bug. It was meant to be an atomic shop item.
---
Thank atom I am not the only one thinking this.
---
The mission accessible is a "test" quest pertaining to scenes, and the valentines one is cut content. I know a LOT about the scouts quests, so DM me if you want more.
---
Oooh what time?
---
Will do man, i'll just send "Forrest" so you know
---
Reeeee 50 of the points we collect just walking about for a shitty repair is evil why won't they listen to our great ideas that weren't in their agreed design brief for the game
---
Ok then use 'improved' repair kits.
---
You don't have to buy or use the atom shop ones, and even if you do you don't have to use """REAL MONEY"""
---
But, I need both hands...
---
X01 Quantum paint
---
There's also apparently a bunch of secret sheepsquatch related quests, one starts at Belle Motel
---
"As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home. Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this..." ~ via Inside The Vault, April 4th
---
unlucky, i’ll check exactly
---
Actually I'd had updated already, just the version is wrong in the Xbox settings. Too much thinking 😉🤔
---
Why does nobody get it? It's the slippery slope they put us on, not the items alone
---
Being only 41 all of those are within upcoming points reach (7 to spend). 
---
Do you feel that's going to make the difference?
---
Is there anything else that might need to shift away from?
---
Sounds perfect. See you in a couple hours!
---
Those calculations are not taking very long however. Its once you have 100k items to keep track of that things get wonky (server keeping tabs on the current players stuff etc) . 
---
 As a very fresh, very new to FO76 player: add more stash weight.  I couldnt loot after 10 hours bc i was full and didnt want to get rid of anything.   Im on to make a mule lbvs. This could be why they dont change it: they count every toon as a new player, and as long as we need space then we will also create more toons, and Bethesda can claim a million users lol.
---
Find any? I cleared it twice and nada.
---
“Certainly not as an Atomic Shop only item.”
---
But they aren’t exclusive to the Atomic Shop.
---
not sure if you noticed, but after they were announced the entire sub was filled with rage and anger, and they didn't change their mind. They aren't going to remove them now, and we aren't going to be anymore angry then we already were.
---
I have those same thoughts as I sit back and eat popcorn at work. Then go home and ignore everyone and play while I still enjoy it ;)
---
The nuke zone radiation has been around since launch. If you die and respawn in or near the zone you have a chance for it to occur.
---
Nice for low levels though.
---
Uh, thanks, converter bot lol
---
This is vague, perhaps a instance like the civil war/halloween plan bodies? But as a silver lining me and this dude are spamming "???" In a parking lot so at least I'm not alone in the confusion
---
It’d be cool if we could move a perk point every level after 50.
---
How do you track so many challenges? I tried to do that and I could never load in because every tracked challenge would perc upon logging in and cause GIANT lag on login. I have to track 4-5 max now
---
Bingo
---
You realize they probably spend the least amount of time on reddit since it's basically 4chan-lite and there's nothing but hate for the game here. Why would they take anything anyone here says seriously?
---
You have a repaired weapon after that. Where's the problem?
---
ya i  absolutely understand what your saying people need to learn how to play the game....
---
Nice, been wanting that for a while.
---
That would be sad
---
green with all the sores.
---
its also for EVERY PA.
---
excavator, raider, 45, 51, 60, ultracite and 01
---
Probably not. They're not as good as having rank 3 Weapon Artisan, so only a really number of players might use these (new players not knowing mechanics and super uber lazy players).
---
Anything going faster than player sprint speed would make the game unstable as the engine can’t take it. So any bicycles or whatever would have to only be as fast as us. Not a bad idea if it allowed basically infinite stamina as even though it doesn’t go faster than you, it would never need to stop. But being able to fast travel while over encumbered in Skyrim wasn’t so bad as it was a single player game. Wouldn’t be as fair in 76.
---
Snow IS free if you climb Everest.
---
 So next they be like "We sell you the OP Two Shot Lazer Rifle in the Atom Store but theres a 0.0001% to get the Three Shot Lazer Rifle by killing the Scorched Queen"
---
hmmm, alrighty.
---
Even after they said all DLC free?
---
I don't know how little you pvp, but if you are going in with broken guns, that's on you. 3 man team, and not once have any of us had to stop to repair our weapons, especially not mid combat.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Read the rest of my post.  That's not the point.
---
No atom shop
---
If you say so
---
Groovy.
---
Awesome! Glad I could help
---
Repair costs were reduced at the same time white knight was nerfed.
---
And it appears to make every pa look like x01 (saw a pic earlier) a guy had a raider power armor and it looked like x01
---
I don't disapprove of the kits because of P2W, I disapprove of them because they're a broken promise: We were told that atoms would be used to purchase cosmetics.  
---
That said, while the definition of P2W is highly variable from person to person and therefore difficult to pin down, I can easily describe a circumstance where the repair kit would equal paying money for an advantage that leads to success (and I've included it in my previous critical post on this topic):
---
I'm playing survival mode. My primary powerful gun breaks. I could run to a place to repair it but I have this repair kit, so I use that instead. Right after I get jumped by someone who I then kill using said powerful gun-- but if I didn't have the repair kit, they would have ambushed me before I could reach the nearest repair location. 
---
So there you go. The problem with your statements is that you base them entirely on isolated assumptions-- like the idea the kit would be bad in combat-- without considering that simply using it before combat, expected or unexpected combat, can easily make or break a fight. 
---
I find your post to be silly because 'legit concerns' are also highly variable. There are no objective 'legit concerns' except rare universals, because people can experience various problems differently based on how they play and pure circumstance. For example, I'm not bothered by PVP problems because I don't PVP... yet it makes little sense for me to claim that PVP problems don't matter or aren't 'legit' concerns.
---
I agree, although if I was new and early in to the game it could be handy.  That level 5 crap breaks easily.
---
This is just my opinion - and take it with a grain of salt because I'm a stranger on the internet.. But newer players / lower level players really don't need to save gear, you can break down a ton of the shit you find and/or sell it for caps at vendors. The Caps and materials you get (i.e. "Junk")  will be far more valuable to you down the line than a lvl 5-10 pipe pistol will. 
---
I constantly find myself in need of more steel scrap or wood scrap or other materials that are abundant on lower level weapons and armor. I don't really find myself wishing I had a pipe pistol, or a leather chest piece.
---
For me is very simple, i will not buy, i have more than 3k atoms from the challenges and i didnt spend as i dont like those items except for some PA skin when was on sale.
---
Yes it is an advantage, it's literally clearly black and white an advantage.
---
If I work 20 minutes at my job to earn my lunch, versus someone who is given a free lunch; is that an advantage? Yes.
---
This worked! I was terrified to do it in case everything broke but I bit the bullet and did it and it worked straight away. Thanks :)
---
Gotcha sorry.
---
By the time you get some of those done you might have also gotten the 7600 hours challenge! :p
---
If it was a new map id buy it!
---
But if you have to repair a lot more reducing the cost does nothing
---
There's literally been a post every couple of hours by someone who can't mod something since the last update. Two weeks and the topic has never been stuck at the top/hot page. Why?
---
Hope everything comes out alright!
---
This is super dramatic
---
Get out of here with this cookie cutter response. You can say your reading our feedback all day long but until you show us that you're willing to act on it. I could careless to know you're reading our feedback.
---
Or that everyone that has played since before the nerf has one.
---
Yes, cause they are in game now
---
A company wants to make money, what a shocker. Totally didn't see that coming.
---
it only does that to me when i get DC'd or join with a different character.  and it doesnt seem to lag me much at all, only a bit annoying when they all start popping one after another.  i dunno bro!
---
My guess is that every where you are supposed to take a picture of the body has a chance to spawn. I server hopped and found him at WWW
---
Read my whole post before making assumptions.  I didn't say anything of the sort.
---
Have him on my server ign baileehhhh
---
Wack.
---
Sorry, I don’t understand your reply?
---
Only done one and I was the only person there with either pistols or lobbing 'nades/missiles. 
---
You say buy one as if that's something I can just shop for. I'm assuming that will need a ton of cash/luck/time to get hold of. As I say, I am limited on play time atm. Am I missing a trick that'll help maybe?
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking.
---
Except repair kits are not an essential for modern life
---
they're not, but domino fallacy is in full effect
---
now you just make me sad :’(
---
Possibly, hard to tell with some of them. Fact is some people aren't cut out for the same amount of work as others, and some people just complain because the got fired or let go and got pissed.
---
Like in CDPR's case, I have seen comments from plenty of current, and even former workers who moved on for other reasons, say that yes there was crunch time (which happens with most games) but they were treated well and most people were happy because they knew what they where creating and it was a passion product for most of them.
---
Bioware is the first really where I haven't seen anyone but the people putting the boots to people necks try to defend against the claims. It's sad what happened there but it's obvious it's gone to crap and needs to be cleaned up.
---
In Bethesda case though, maybe it's the case, but I really feel it's more they got by on years of sloppy development covered up by the modding community. They got to sure of themselves and thought they could tackle an online, persistent game. But instead it just put a huge microscope on all the flaws that now can't be covered up with mods. 
---
Whether they take the time to use this as an opportunity to fix the issues they have gotten away with for years is the big question. If anything I think Bethesda issue is maybe they are too lax on their employees, but it's hard to say because I don't know what it's like to code on the garbage engine Bethesda uses.
---
Can I just block everyone all the time and eventually wind up playing by myself? lmao 
---
Like I've said elsewhere, I don't care about the workshop, if they actually wanted it that badly they could have had it, but they literally went through and destroyed every little thing I had made including the things to pull up resources. I don't know how to relinquish a workshop but after being there a few times and realising I couldn't get my loot back, I went elsewhere, they didn't want my shop and were farming me for caps according to someone else. 
---
but yeah, I'll try doing that next time I decide I want a workshop (mainly for the plans that come from defending it).
---
Man, I just got back into this game this month since I saw the roadmap and the effort they seemingly put into it. This is unacceptable and a serious slap in the face to the community. I actually really enjoy the game but I cannot support a company that so blatantly goes against what the people want in favor of a quick buck. I hope this shit blows up in your face Bethesda.
---
You gotta add your platform
---
People that think this gives some sort of PvP advantage has clearly never PvPed in this game
---
My psn is Woolley8 for when the friend request comes through
---
Had i known tatttoos are forehead only i wouldnt have spent my free atoms on that.  :/  I just started an account sunday and earned about 600 atoms in 12 hours of play (level 10).
---
And don’t forget to not be a greedy ass evil company like your becoming and charge prices that are fair for skins !!! 10 dollars is highway robbery stop trying to copy EA’s business model this is fallout !!! I would love to customize my character buy different power armors etc but your blatantly overcharging is to death !!!
---
No other game out right now gives me the same enjoyment, and I may enjoy the game further down the road.  For now I’ll distance myself and play some other games.  It’s more a principal issue than an enjoyment issue.  I love the game but I won’t participate in a “pay to win”.  I’d rather they make the game a monthly subscription if they need a few dollars a month from the gamers.
---
It's not P2W because there is nothing to win. They are, however, a silly waste of money. All the high end content takes like 10 to 20 minutes to deal with. Your fear should be fine to handle it. If you are finding your weapons and armor are breaking at an inordinate rate, consider using perks that will help offset this or run with back ups.
---
Possible Spawns:
---
Camden Park
---
Mr Fuzzy
---
Wavy Willards
---
Harpers Ferry Old Armory
---
Prickettts Fort
---
Freddy’s House of Scares
---
Red rocket mega stop
---
Giant Teapot
---
Will update with more 👍
---
Ok. Is what I said not true, WarmheartedMagic?
---
Bunny head, you can craft it in your armor bench
---
Thought that was just me hearing things. Glad to know I'm not crazy.
---
Ah i always forgot
---
A bunny mask
---
Have you got Rattle Hands? That can affect weapon damage
---
It's Really not that much of a problem as long as you have your camp in a remote area far from player heavy places like Whitesprings
---
Yeah, this was my impression. Some replies are giving me some hope but it seems my hopes outweighed it's viability.
---
&gt; Gradually expanding the build limit for our camps will turn this game into The Sims.
---
So you're saying fancy underwear is a go?
---
Now we just need a firepole for camp use.
---
From practice, you may not see an advantage. But mechanically, the whales don't have to have repair perks anymore, and if you don't you'll still spend more time repairing and finding ballistic fiber than they will. While they get more loot than you. Call it whatever advantage you want. mechanically it's there.
---
I wish you were on Xbox I've got 47 TSE Dragons I'd give you one. :c
---
Np, conduits are horribly buggy to place. I stopped trying, and scrapped all of mine. I was trying to wire an entire 4 story house.
---
I just glitch wires through doorways instead now. It also saves more budget.
---
Thank ye!
---
I get it sometimes, in the last couple of weeks. I don't have any whiskys and like one of the lead mixers. I've read whisky isn't even in the game yet, so I just keep going back for that Bellini or whichever.
---
Yeah?
---
More content, this game should have just follwed the normal doc system becouse free dlc stuff always sucks and isnt as good as it could be if just paid normally
---
How much repair would a repair kit repair if a repair kit could repair a repair kit
---
Nop
---
The extra pellet seems to carry the 25% dmg bonus still, so its like you get a slug added instead of pellet
---
I PvP all the time, and I’ve killed exactly one person who was in this “vulnerable” state.  This in my opinion is not an advantage at all.  Besides they will still be vulnerable while they are in the menu applying the repair kit.  I would argue that if they are doing that mid PvP battle that they will be way more vulnerable than if they went to their base where I had no idea where they were to fix their armor instead of being stationary in their pip boy navigating the menu trying to repair their gear. While I’m actively hunting their dot.
---
Scrap. Autocorrect got me.
---
I offer only one clarification: Bethesda's net worth is 2.5 *billion*.
---
Nice, hate that place
---
Your internet good bro?
---
It's essentially paying real money for ballistic fiber, one of the hardest to gain items in the game.
---
You're buying items.
---
That's p2w
---
And they have functionally endless cosmetic items to make money with.
---
i think you just have to find a broken camera
---
have him on my server ign baileehhhh I'm on PC
---
Cool, thanks for the reply!
---
As I said, it's not about the Repair Kit at all, it's because they can introduce more items that are going to affect our gameplay if we let this go.
---
honestly I think wearing unyielding on a melee build, making my agility absurdly high, has more of an effect on stealth than anything else. I literally just sneak up right up to creatures and they don't notice me.
---
But the game is pay to win now. We NEED a leg up...
---
Found it in the parking lot, body named Ansel, leaned against a car
---
I went with a focus on 'nades with pistols as backup as my plan. Going by the perk choices available I thought I had specced hard into them. Feel like maybe my support perks are letting me down and generally demo being weak in the situations you're more likely to come to later on.
---
Nope, I literally just logged in and noticed it after playing last night. It's been 118 DMG since I started playing a while ago. Now it's suddenly much less.
---
Can I have your weapons, caps and armor, please?
---
I'm also loving the first list of daily's with no camera challenges, now that the camera is in game!. He polar opposite of last week.. well done Todd 👍👍
---
Have the devs said anything about this? Do we know if this is a bug or is it intended I understand it breaking a bit faster than the rest but this is ridiculous
---
Can I now just claim a refund for every single thing I've ever bought on the shop?
---
I’ll check to see for myself
---
Yeah I wasn't trying to finish the frustration and anger you felt, its happened to me once or twice, i was just making a dumb comment😅.
---
Afaik the only way to relinquish a workshop is to server hop, which, I'm my opinion, is a really dumb way to go about things from a game design perspective.
---
At the very least in adventure mode, if someone starts a claim on our 'shops we should be allowed a small window of time to go to the defense of it or to just release ownership of it to the new claimant.
---
Nothing for me at uncanny caverns.
---
It's at robco NE part of cranberry bog
---
Its 3 waves of Mr handys then a 3 star legendary and I've gotten great drops from it and the event itself
---
Its pretty much the only event i ever farm
---
Killing n00b5 is a large part of your game?? Okay, go away.
---
Just got one from Philippi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
+F
---
This is how it starts, willfully contributing money to a company for future free DLC.
---
Shame on you!
---
:)
---
I want that one too. Going to grind for a bit before I get it.
---
Yea it got added in today. I’m still looking around for this tourist who has a bucket list you have to complete...apparently.
---
Jump on top of something or stealth your way through it... I don’t understand the issue.  If you blow the van up right outside the golf club you can even jump on that without marsupial and avoid all that damage.
---
How much technical data do you have to turn in to get drops like that?
---
This is the wrong question to ask. Will we buy enough repair kits to fund a "free" expansion?
---
For the record I would pay for a dlc.
---
Same here...kept checking all day for the 4th and 5th eggs...never showed up in the Atom shop
---
Where at? Ive jumped like 10 servers looking for it there
---
X-01 plague rider looks pretty damn cool, especially with the red light-up eyes.
---
Bleh - I use T-60 for a goddamn reason...
---
Not an X-01 fan so I guess this will be a non-purchase for me
---
Also that “news” post is from today when they released it.
---
upvoted. hopefully it gets on the front page. enough with the sleazy monetization.
---
hire competent modders if you have to, but give us good cosmetics like the riders.
---
Does nothing? I don’t know the exact numbers but if you have to repair more often at less material cost then over a duration of time you should use the same or similar amount of materials as pre-nerf. Whether it actually worked out like that I’m not sure, but it doesn’t do nothing.
---
Phillipi Graveyard, miners monument, point pleasant, colonel kelly monument, palace of winding path, beckley workshop, and a few others.
---
So basically tourist locations.
---
Do other players see it the same way you do? Meaning like in game on their screens or just your screen?
---
I never looked at the pictures, the description alone never indicated that it would change the actual model type of the armor itself. I expected a grotesque appearance for each of the types, not just an X-01 suit.
---
Also, did your player used to snore when sleeping or do I just not sleep enough?
---
You mean RKR? ;)
---
Soo.. is it being done to death or not done at all? Cause you majorly contradicted yourself.
---
The water park at the top of the map he's sitting against the car in the middle of the parking lot
---
Ah, that's disappointing to hear.
---
It feels like a bait and switch.
---
It seems like my auto sub machine gun got a buff to damage
---
So it’s a terrible underarmor for upgrades then compared to Enclave and BoS?
---
No players around on my server, and I have no mic to convey what I want to say to them
---
Do other players see you in the same PA? I ask this since you sometimes see different things than other players.
---
I think it's so everyone can enjoy them. war and death look really cool, but T45 and T60 are such terrible PAs.
---
When the fermenter says 0/10 that means all slots are open. When you are "in" the fermenter you can "see" every beverage type thing in your stash. 
---
You can't even access any fermenter but your own, why would trying other people's do anything?
---
Probably not intended lol
---
On dead ghouls at white springs
---
- Gatling plasma has severe bugs. The "one shot" bug and the instant loss of remaining charge bug.
---
- Some armor items with "+25 radiation resistance" dont actually provide that bonus resistance.
---
- Trading with either a vendor or other player, sometimes the analog stick on console starts going schizophrenic, not letting you move up and down through items properly.
---
- Grognaks axe still wont repair over 100% condition.
---
- Sometimes buildings, furniture and other objects fail to completey load in (non-camp) areas. I've seen buildings in harpers ferry and pleasant valley cabins without floorboards, stairs, furniture etc.
---
- Active quests and events sometimes dont appear on the HUD or even properly activate or remain activated when they should. I've been at some events where the event just "disappears" unexpectedly. No fail or completion announcement, it just ceases.
---
- Horde events are voidable by random mobs that kill the horde boss while you're trying to locate it.
---
- Horde events also don't provide any reward to people who are participating but dont manage to kill the horde boss.
---
- Event markers are often bugged. Uranium fever is the main one, usually appearing in the mountains between the forest and savage divide. I also recently travelled to a horde event that was marked in this spot, and it transported me to the inside of the garrahan (?) building at the very southern part of the ash heap. The event just disappeared after I loaded in there. I'm fairly certain horde events are never suppose to transport you indoors either.
---
- The action point bar often doesnt refresh properly. Sometimes you have to stop moving altogether for a few secs to get it to start reloading, and even then if you do something simple like walking soon after it can interrupt it again.
---
- We still cant inspect items in player to player trading to allow us to see all effects of legendary items.
---
- Enemies in some locations are able to see you and be able to attack you/get converted to hostile behind sealed walls or even through different levels of a building. Prime example is Fort Defiance when you go up the lift to the 3rd/4th floor areas inhabited by the BoS. Ghouls and wendigos on the 2nd (?) floor become aware or hostile to you and even somehow get through the lift to attack you, even though to find those enemies naturally, you'd have to go through the whole right-hand wing of the asylum to get there. I've also seen super mutant's in west tek that seem able to see you through doors and walls.
---
Those are just some issues off the top of my head, there are so many more.
---
If you shake it more than twice it counts as playing with it
---
spoiler tag, asshole.
---
I want a Mr. Handy to automate my picking and crafting.
---
Just bought atoms for it. This is how you make money, Bethesda. Fuck repair kits.
---
No, I mean. The text in the atom says the skin can be applied to all PAs. So either the text is wrong or you will be lucky and it will get fixed, so you can purchase it.
---
Cant quit something I didnt start
---
Its because people do have mixed feelings and we spent weeks on hundreads of threads saying exactly this. Downvote doesn't always mean i disagree, it means its not relevant or should be in the light.
---
They delivered exactly what was shown. The skin is a fancy x-01 reskin, if it changed to match any other set they would have shown it applied to other sets just like every other PA skin.
---
At the entrance by the car in the middle
---
Yeah you can repair them apparently and you start a quest by doing so and no I don’t think so I’m not sure though I’ll look
---
You spelled "people as a whole disagreeing and standing up against things they dont like get results, but when I disagree with it I call it screeching and ignore the entire consumer/producer relationship, or really any group feedback on the planet" wrong.
---
I have a feeling it’s unintentional
---
Now it is. Wasnt prior to the patch.
---
2 words: long cords.
---
Try equipping something else, that fixed it for me.
---
Its not about the repair kits. Its about breaking a promise. A promise means nothing if you can the definition whenever you want to suit you. Its the bad precedent they have now set.
---
There exist 4 options for repair kits: non-existent, paid, rare, and easy to obtain.
---
You have to pick one, they are mutually-exclusive options, and if my 'assumption' is wrong, you refuse to pick any of them.
---
Calm down!
---
Yes I think it is, I think beth listened to the community about wanting the armor for the different types  but it was too late to create new skins for each type lol so all armor looks like the x-01
---
Here's a link for everyone who IS actually upset by this:

---
Gotcha... I know when you kill a legendary it could be in two different places for two different players. 
---
Also that glitch that made players all stretched out to others looked normal to the player.
---
TL;DR: Welcome to being the small minority who are yelling about this. So instead of yelling about this, yell about actual bugs that screw everyone over, because this doesn't exactly do that.
---
Guys I'm pretty sure this is not the end of the world for this game. I see these repair kits as more of a way to help, I'm level 56 or 57 atm and honestly because I never cared to spec myself out to uber repair anything, because um I'm not playing this game to be damned repairman, I see these repair kits as something to help players like me out and heck maybe even help out newer players get the feel for the game. 
---
Go ahead and downvote me all you want guys but they aren't looking at the less than one percent of the player base that exists on reddit and even the one percent of that one percent who are absolutely pissed about this. They are looking at the millions of players who don't reside here on reddit and trying to help them out. 
---
So don't be so sardonic, why not put all of this effort towards getting them to fix actual bugs that can and will break them game for new and old alike? Much love to all those who read through this.
---
For how to start a quest? Really?
---
It really doesn't happen tho. We have been in extended fire fights for upwards of an hour over one workshop. Still have not once needed to stop for repairs.
---
Server hopping time then. It’s a random instance
---
I had a pet Yao Guai yesterday for a grand total for 30 minutes. I named him Fluffy as a joke since he had almost no fur. Three super mutant Primus’ came and slaughtered him 😭 RIP Fluffy
---
&gt;And they have functionally endless cosmetic items to make money with.
---
Which is it, are people spending atoms on cosmetics or are they hoarding?
---
I am a little excited for that game to have it's GOTY edition, that's when I'll get to play it.
---
I hope it's not a bug. I don't want to wear T45 just for war.
---
Absolutely nothing to do with the op's post. None of their shit is missing or got swapped with other different gear.
---
Here's a solution for everyone upset by the repair kits:
---
So you ignored some of the major bugs.. like a broken social menu. Hunger and Thirst degrading at a too fast of a rare to be viable....
---
I was nauseus when i saw what they did with blades phone game. It's an interactive slot machine.
---
Where in the cave?
---
Dont call people names, asshole.
---
Upvote for creativity
---
Nice! Thanks a lot! Yup time for me to start hopping!
---
50 atoms lol, absolutely useless
---
That’s been around. It’s not very loud, or at least wasn’t, but the snoring has been there.
---
Is this haiku?
---
50 atoms for one 250 atoms for 6
---
I literally said the only place these PR reps have any input is with the development team
---
No. No. No. 
---
All this does is make the damn encumbrance mechanic useless, which will further skew the power imbalance in the game. 
---
Sure, add a bicycle, let us ride it for a slightly faster method of travel (just no mountain climbing bicycles a la Skyrim, please) but honestly... you ever try riding a fully laden bike that doesn't have proper luggage racks? 
---
Nah, the limit has to be set somehow... otherwise, just toss out inventory limits altogether.
---
Thanks for putting the time into this reply. Hugely appreciated. A lot to consider.
---
That build looks a long way away for me to reach. I'm seeing 31 levels to get the perk cards and another 9 to respec the SPECIALs. I'm not saying that's a deal breaker but that's almost as many levels to transition as this toon has. Feels like starting again is quicker.
---
Loving the tip about the 10mm though. I do use 10mm primarily at the moment so maybe I need to mod it better first and see how I go. Thanks again.
---
That bit about not a single response except for adding them. They put in a note about their reasoning. That is a response.
---
The bit about not listening. Obviously they have. That doesn't mean they have to do what you want. 
---
It is disappointing to not get your way on things. It is frustrating when someone changes the game plan. But it happens in business and irl. Things change. 
---
It is a bit of an echo chamber here, but I'd imagine that most players are not even on reddit and have no idea that this is even a topic of discussion. And will go happily on playing the game and just roll with the changes. Most people who play FO76 are not feeling emotionally moved by repair kits in the atomic shop today. 
---
I don't doubt your sadness, but still seems an over-the-top and dramatic response.
---
For me, I have real life stuff I'm upset over. So I guess it's just perspective.
---
BARTER 100
---
Wait fuck that's skyrim
---
CHARISMA 10
---
I’m gonna take a pic and send it to you in dm.
---
Just get a bucket streamlines the process
---
No problem, I got him on my second hop so it shouldn't take too long!
---
Jesus christ, just dont buy them, im not going to
---
I use Scrapper and break down cheap guns and have hundreds and hundreds of steel.
---
I lurk to keep an eye on the game but this is news to me. Is it against the rules to offer trades on this sub? Idk if it's any good but I've got a bunch of junk and a few explosive shotgun legendaries from back in the day
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/DMoTTwT
---
Just look for yourself
---
We also have seen bethesda travel down this wicked path before with ESO and with the clusterfuck of fo76s launch. it is yet another nick to fo76s arterys and i am not sure that it will last too long before it dies at this rate
---
From what I understand, only non-texture type mods should run on Misc.
---
EG my my ini: "sResourceArchiveMisc = SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2, NoNews.ba2"
---
Everything else is on sResourceArchive2List since they're texture related.
---
The drop rate varies but I believe it's around 5% for each paint, which must be done sequentially. Took me about 20-30 tries to get each paint with some people reporting 100s of tries for one.
---
I have him on PS4 at wavy Willard's if any one needs him
---
Don’t worry I’ll buy 5 on your behalf. I’ll even rename them after you. Whinylittlebitch1, whinylittlebitch2, and so on..
---
It's not like "repairing items" is a new feature to the fallout franchise - you used to have to do it all the time in Fallout 4.
---
Now with a smaller stash size, everyone is bitching cause they can't keep 10K of everything on hand to instantly gratify themselves whenever they need to repair anything.
---
Here's a solution to help you with this glaring upset:
---
1. Yep. The more annoying one is where you get radiation but rad-sponge doesn't work.
---
2. There are two legendary armor effects with the title "+25 Rad Resistance". One of them is actually disease resistance, but it's misnamed.
---
3. From the ESM, it seems to be 98% rad reduction for hazmat, and 15% per piece of PA. I guess one of the "designers" really didn't like the look of people running around in nuke zones without PA/hazmat.
---
Where in it? I looked every where, but it might not have been there in my instance.
---
I fail to see in any sense how a Basic Repair Kit from the Atom shop is Play2Win?  I'm ok with it.
---
I believe on PS4 it saves photos in the photo folder even after deleting in game.
---
10times still nothing. Oh my god.
---
They are doing that rn, i have actually bought atoms just to get some of the cool stuff that is in there
---
1400.
---
This is them making up for the camera quests we couldn't do all the last week.
---
To be clear, you're saying that the "running no longer affects stealth" only helps at a distance. I would still need the other weight management, mods and perks up close?
---
Alright, this is the first time I've heard anything like that. I'm not disagreeing but how was that determined? Nothing on the card says anything about range to target.
---
is that good?
---
Pretty lackluster update all around. Doubt I'll be spending any atoms on any of this stuff. The tactical outfit is kinda cool but if it's considered a casual under armor the linings for it suck and I'll never use it. Not fond of the plague rider armor, I'm definitely holding out for the T-51 and T-60 skins.
---
Bethesda, make more cool shit and people will spend money on your dumb currency! Repair kits ain't it, Todd.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019
---
&gt;As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, **such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s**, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home.
---
We'll see what happens, I guess.
---
I don't like the UI of the power armr, at all, since F4. It's too invasive and ugly too.
---
It's cute you think people won't buy these
---
Bah. You people and your herd mentality. I buy whatever I please. 
---
Majority of PC players have better computers than I have yet you bitches don't seem to see your better hardware or net, as any pay to win. 
---
I also went and brought one because muh 50 atoms!!, but sadly it seems you can't take screenshots from atom shop, and Im too busy right now to actually login to server to take it from there. For time being just take my word for it and remember to downvote me as much as you like :)
---
Well, there are several photos you can look before purchasing.
---
hey man,
---
thank your for that guide! thought bloody and power armor is a no go, didnt realise the emergency protocol mod.
---
after the patch i modded my x-01 and using a bloody fire axe and just onehitting everything.
---
now im trying to get the bloody .50 cal machine gun. only have a bloody combat rifle \^\^
---
(btw i use 1x overdrive servors for being even faster when running)
---
one question: where do you pa users farm for fusion cores? and are there any tricks i can use (like using a 5% fusioncore to build a new one or something like that)
---
I. The atom shop today 50 atoms for one 250 for 6
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
GT ?
---
A funny addon, the sound is a bit peculiar, indeed!
---
ok
---
You don’t even have the game installed????
---
I’ve not encountered the world outside of the CAMP loading slowly, the only other one others have mentioned is doors not working and then suddenly being open. 
---
The CAMP thing is a frustration and super annoying when you are, as I seemingly always am, being attacked by invisible ghouls. 
---
Interestingly two of my turrets turned red and started shooting each other but didn’t have line of sight so couldn’t hit. This happened just after first load.
---
Is that dedicated save file space per account? That 1 TB you mentioned. Noob asking here.
---
Wasn’t in the patch notes, so I assume no.
---
Cost: 1400 atoms
---
That's obviously not a solution.
---
It's like saying: "oh boy, there's a leak in your roof? Well just live outside kek"
---
We're trying to patch the leaky roof before the house falls in on us
---
I sent a fr, thank you
---
That's understandable. I had a bet dog for maybe 40 minutes. For once, I actually invited some potential friends to my CAMP/team. Unfortunately they brought several Fatmen with them to show off. 1 hr later...
---
"Uh.. has anyone seen the dog?" 
---
No body was ever found...
---
I've noticed some servers have way more 3* spawns than other servers so it doesn't surprise me that map drops may vary. It makes no sense and the statistician are laughing at us but we'll keep server hopping and collecting the loot.
---
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE
---
Yeah wtf
---
Maybe they fixed the Combat armor plan drops?
---
That's my point, why I put the link in.  At least they finally responded.
---
It doesn't mostly due to the game not having a competitive environment
---
When it says that it is a skin for all the power armor models and all it does is change the model to look like X-01, then no, that's called false advertisement according to the description of the item
---
Welp, by fo76
---
They'll never fix the hunger and thirst rates... How else will they sell the fridges they'll release soon in the atom shop
---
Yeah. I don't think they appreciate how much money they left on the table by not doing cosmetics right. They gave out way too many free Atoms, and didn't stock the shop with sufficiently enticing items. The limited-time skins may have front-loaded some purchase revenue, but it's also caused lost sales. I've had friends miss skins that they would have bought due to being out on business.
---
A bench requires you to be in a specific location while standing. A repair kit can be used anywhere while crouched. If they're crouched, you won't be able to see their dot.
---
Also, A large portion of people fighting over workshops in adventure right now are just out to grief people.
---
Not all of them, but the amount engaging in that behavior isn't insignificant.
---
lol
---
People are already actually COMPLAINING about this because even seeing the pictures showing it as an X-01 model they expected it to change and match their frame. This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Not upset, i just find you pathetically funny.. " entitled fuck " you're triggered.
---
You Shit Troll.
---
If somebody gets him on Xbox let me know
---
Yeah we can, but it’s literally makes every other armor look like xo1 and not every armor is xo1 that’s the problem
---
I like you.
---
I say this because everyone seems to nuke as far south / east as possible (with 70% of the nuke or more being off the map in areas players can't go), and THOSE are the times when I see her flying off the map and not coming back. I think she tries to stick close to the nuke zone. She never does this if you nuke the way I suggested. Sorry if you inferred something else from my post.
---
Just about enought to do "Hunter/Hunted" challenge xD
---
They responded by adding it and making the update news post. 🤦‍♀️
---
The first sentence stands independent of the second and having written what I did I should also say I applaud your efforts at attempting to hold a corporate entity to their word, after all nailing jelly to a tree is not easy.
---
Imposter sheep squatch assaultron head skin available for 4 days at 500 atoms
---
Plague rider PA available for 6 days 1400 atoms
---
Kill laugh love sign on 30% off for 490 atoms
---
And added a bunch that aren’t time sensitive
---
What platform are you?
---
I wanna be a scotsman!! , where can u find those kilts
---
Super annoying I hopped the past 30 minutes I don’t wanna fast travel places and deal with all that easier to just hop
---
That extra 10 secs is really going to fuck over everyone else.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot! Sorry :/
---
 I just traded for one last week, not sure when they were readded. They fixed the name for it as well, no longer reads as "marine".
---
6 days
---
Being able to repair your gear without a repair station or junk is an advantage and you very obviously don't understand the junk pvp economy of this game if you think not needing it isn't an advantage.
---
Apparently it’s in Uncanny Caverns
---
Who cares if you dont? Stop crying
---
That's just messed up.
---
I got started with some small trades from decent drops, then lucked into a 3\* bloodied explosive .50 cal for a steal. Sold that for 50,000 caps, stockpiled legacy explosive energy weapons as an investment, and retired from trading to actually play the game.
---
I mean it’s bad that the repair kits are in the Atom Shop, but isn’t it good that they aren’t expensive.
---
I agree but the fact that it’s so overpriced for what it does makes them look even worse
---
Lol downvoted for bringing up a legit problem.
---
Ah yes, 10 seconds for aluminum, black titanium, crystal shards, copper
---
Yep. 
---
Wow, you’ve proven me wrong for sure bud
---
That’s what I thought too - just wanted to confirm it’s still broke in game.
---
Also the free sign. Can’t remember how long it’s for I claimed already
---
I think I have a bug, game it's saying to me you are in main menu thanks anyway
---
It was contained in the mega thread however that just killed the outrage from ths outsidd looking in
---
Still there?
---
Where in it?
---
They definetly want us to stop playing. Or i don't understand. Why would they make you run around like retard.
---
AH! but that is the trick!
---
They have increased the spoil rate of food/drinks to entice players into purchasing the upcoming fridges, they nerfed the white knight perk to make the repair kits desirable... what is next?
---
The problem with the repair kits is not that they are on the Atomic Shop but that you pay to forgo the material grinding.  That is pay2win.
---
We have workshops that give rewards such as ballistic fiber and stimpacks
---
Yeah and the advertisement is kinda dodgy and hard to understand. It says it can be applied to the other power armors and just contains 3 pictures of x01 plague Walker. I'm glad I came here for clarification first
---
Im in the same boat here..I actually dread the damage this is going to cause when the wave of people leaving hits.
---
one can easily earn atoms to buy 7 a week, so far from over priced. And that is just on dailies. Not the weekly or monthlies.
---
My only big complaint is that Bethesda went against their word when they said only cosmetics will be in the shop. I don’t really care if repair kits exist in the game but I do think that if it’s a field repair, it should pause your character for a period of time for it to be applied.
---
For the biggest concern, if the repair kits stay in the shop, what will bethesda add next? Xp boosts? Damage boosts? Resistance maybe? Where does it stop? I get that this game is an experimentation but it’s still no excuse to back out of promises made.
---
Some of us feel that they are making the same mistake blizzard did. They accommodate casual players that want an easier game and ignore those who want a harder game. I’d prefer a harder game. It takes almost nothing to repair your gear. The worst part is ballistic fiber. So a solution could be is either make white knight what it used to be or make ballistic fiber more available. Instead they decided to add a new layer of complexity that they know that they will get a ton of negative feedback for.
---
I only saw a small group of people asking for something like this, while the rest has been saying don’t do it. Their best bet is to implement difficulty levels.
---
I'm still waiting to find mine.
---
No, I think they're confusing the first and second parts of the perk description. Personally alongside Escape Artist I use ultra-light mods on arms and legs, with dense on the chest. I also have 35 agility though, so it's hard to say what out of all that has the greatest effect. With all that going on though, the only thing enemies can detect is weapon fire, so I can move to a new firing position undetected.
---
Did they actually change the wording? I can’t find anything in their posts saying “cosmetic”.
---
First of all, thanks for this great game Bethesda, I love it despite the problems it still has. 
---
As you can see, lots of us are against repair kits in the Atom Shop, I don’t think there’re pay to win, but still it’s an item that affects te game experience, and such items souldn’t belong there. Whether they should exist at all is another matter. 
---
And to everyone sayin “oh fuck Bethesda, give me my money back”, that’s not gonna happen, but the fact that they clarified their stance and said that they’ll see what happens means they’re listening to us, but you’ll gain more expressing your point of view and telling them WHY you think that way, will be more productive than telling them to go fuck themselves.
---
Which is something you could have realized before purchasing if you had just look at the photos.
---
Well since there backtracking on there word fuck it go all in add real NPC's when the vaults open I guarantee that would make the "story" less stale
---
They have critical thinking skills if they are changing their behavior based off of actual objective evidence.
---
I think you're underestimating how fast a dragon breaks... it's not realistic as a main at all. It's an as needed heavy hitter that in pvp battles breaks almost every time as is. I didn't think it was important to specify my dragon is an instigating 3star but even in the insanely unlikely event I can find a backup for that to carry around with me an inventory of repair kits is still going to be more helpful (especially since I can also repair my tse lever if it breaks) and they'd also take up less space in my inventory.
---
You can absolutely say it doesn't provide enough of an advantage to be upset about and make a case on that ground but to say it doesn't provide any kind of advantage at all just isn't accurate.
---
Papa Nurgle DLC confirmed.
---
Now, if only they'd drop some sweet Slaanesh gear. I want "one titty out" power armour.
---
Upvoted because you did alot of time writing this but i stopped Reading half way
---
Pretty sure someone was talking anbout thus earlier. You have to update the .ini I think
---
The problem with is until now (ideally) their balance consideration was aiming for the line of fun between annoyance and challenge, now with monetization they have a new pressure pushing against the best interests of the players experience.
---
I will post it for sure. You do the same. On my 5th server lol.
---
Thank you for clarity!
---
Mechanically, a weapon repair kit has nothing to do with ballistic fiber.  That's for armor.
---
Mechanically, someone who uses weapon repair perks gets to have a damage advantage and enhanced durability over someone who uses a standard repair kit to get up to 100% or uses no weapon repair perks.
---
Apple your apples and orange your oranges.  Your not arguing this well.
---
Nice! I dropped 2 explosive laser guns before they removed them in the TSE nerf. Still kicking myself over it.
---
Were you turning the game all the way off? They only showed up on PC if I turned the game off.
---
The pictures showed you exactly what you were buying. Every PA skin set that is just a reskin of each individual frame shows a picture of it on every single applicable frame. You saw a picture of just the X-01 and bought it anyway.
---
You asked me if what you said wasn't true. Lol. That's why I wrote more. And you are about clear communication, so.
---
I still find myself woefully unmoved. And will later spend 50 Atoms to try a kit out for my Grognak's axe, which is still not fixed so that it can be over repaired. It's frustrating, but I roll with it.
---
I will say that if I don't like a business' practices, I send a letter to corporate, wait a reasonable time for a response. If I don't like it, I just stop patronizing. Keep it moving. In a competitive market, which the gaming industry is, there are many other choices.
---
Looks great!!
---
Another one of these post?
---
Thank you.
---
What weapons use ballistic fiber?
---
I agree the bone raider skin is awesome, but I play a non-PA character, so I want that sort of thing for regular outfits/helmets too.
---
I’ve server hopped 5 times checked colonal Kelly’s battlefield cemetery and Prickett fort still nothing😐
---
dracometeorrr
---
I won't be on until much later tonight, probably 8/9pm est
---
The game data files don't specify damage per pellet, just the number of projectile and the total damage. Two-shot adds 25% damage and one projectile, so each pellet probably does a bit more damage with two-shot shotguns.
---
What’s your take on the imposter outfit?
---
and aaaallllllll these other people saying the exact same thin i am... its all their internet too right?
---
(btw im on gig fiber wired directly with a ssd)
---
Yeah, it's stupid the way handled it. Whoever is in charge of PR really needs a brush up on there skills, as this subject was a hot subject on this platform as well as others and they should have handled it differently.
---
Yes ! You can now pay real money to repair your armor and can build a camera to take pictures instead of pressing escape !\\
---
 Stash limit is 800 now. No carry limit added.
---
Yes, specifically you.  I just wasn't trying to embarrass you by name dropping... Who are you again?
---
Damn I have 70 😂 I bought the tux when they put it on sale, and some other things, shit got me broke
---
And your wasting some of that posting on here? Make haste!!
---
If you watch the inside the vault, they also stated the best why to provide feedback is on reddit which is exactly what I did. 
---
Ya and move on is what tons of players are doing daily. Lack of end game and nothing to do. And today another slap in the face to the player community.
---
Your statements are based on assumptions mine are from my own personal experience.
---
Being competitive does not mean it gives a company the right to go back on their word. Nor does it instil confidence in said company. Most of us have defended fallout 76 from the beginning been through all the bad and still we fought because we believed Bethseda was trying this best and trying to make this right.
---
Now they r liars.
---
GT. Manny sandov I’m at wavy whatever
---
Yeah have done this way and resolved thank you very much
---
Your spot on, I play with a new players and help them but they always hit the cap right away and have to tell them to toss weapons not at max lvl and you don't need regular variants you can just make.
---
Look on the bright side, at least there are no camera daily in today
---
OH WAIT ...
---
Uh, no. The level cap with the base game is 20. With the Broken Steel DLC it's raised to 30. I still don't know what you mean by skill point cap because skills go up to 100. That's not changed with the DLC though. DLC only affects level cap.
---
Have it so you have to do a small quest to get it so you have to play on the alt for to actually send stuff to it.
---
Thats kinda funny if its intended.
---
Yeah, I'm looking at it trying to figure out what other hats you could use but not finding any not locked behind the tokens. Are there any?
---
Now we wait for the queue to clear
---
Sounds good I will check them when I get off work later today and accept them. 
---
I am in the eastern time zone and usually play from 6-7 to about 11 daily. Get to play a lot more on the weekends. 
---
Thanks again for the invite and looking forward to playing with your team.
---
Check your amors workbench mate! It’s hidden in there :)
---
They've already nurfed White Knight, what's next?
---
500 atoms lol
---
My friend built on the edge of a cliff and before he moved things around you would fast travel and fall off the cliff lol.
---
Yep for sure.
---
She is laid on the path leading to the canons and monument.
---
Hey!  PC wants to keep the consoles company, having the same lag-loadfest so, everyone can stop blaming their hardware thinking it's subpar, it's THEM not you.
---
Consider this a spoiler: [Here's a liste of quests that were added with the Wild Appalachia update](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_quests#Wild_Appalachia).
---
I want a scooter. With a bell I can ding to let enemies know that doom is upon them.
---
😂I nearly splashed all my atoms a couple days ago
---
The radio comes on once a new track starts.
---
Did your bag have salt in it?
---
Still works fine.  I never used it pre nerf so I'm not sure what I missed.
---
X-01, I have been looking for that one for about 4 weeks now, sometimes hoping 10 times or more.  I will get it eventually, lol
---
I have over 3000+ atoms with no reason to use them because everything is cosmetic. I want items and I'd rather pay to get an item because all the good stuff has a less than one percent chance to drop.
---
Maybe it’s a bug? This game has had one or two of those.
---
Lol you mean like every game does? Quit crying you entitled fuck.
---
Not all heroes wear capes!
---
Except you have to actually find a broken one first. Consider reading the patch notes.
---
I should have learned a long Reddit time ago that asking a question or having a different thought means down votes and people going off...lol
---
It’s a discussion and many get defensive! I get the passion but some are over the top. 
---
Mods should work and should be all working and a real fix to take place before extras. That was a game changer! 
---
I added the prime receiver to the fixer thinking making a pretty good rifle just better... jokes on me now I can make ammo...lol
---
The impatient is really the only one. Pay for convenience is all this is. I don't care too much, but I will also not buy any because I don't want to pay for convenience. If somebody values however many atoms this costs over taking 5 minutes to gather materials and find a workbench to repair stuff, they can feel free to pay for that.
---
 \*Brilliant\*
---
You don’t do much math huh , let’s say you played for a lapse of 30 days , missing 10 atoms daily at the end surprisingly it’s 300 , wow now if we multiply that sometimes it’s more then one ...
---
Therefore if you enjoy and play the game you will find yourself convinced that those missing atoms would had gotten you let’s say the plague walker skin
---
Yes. I stopped playing for a little while because it was too buggy and necessities like screws and other items weren't dropping enough. I've only played maybe 2 hours since I downloaded again on Saturday, but the drops seem a little better. The game is less buggy and laggy. It's still not perfect, but it's better.
---
I’d rather them not be in the game, but then again they aren’t that important. ESO does this with repair kits, but nobody complains about those. ESO didn’t have a slippery slope into pay to win , so I doubt this will. ( I know it’s technically a different developer, but Bethesda is probably taking some  queues from Zenimax’s in game shop like tattoos, cloths, skins, repair kits, furniture)
---
I don't and never have had a problem with repairing things. My problem is with Bethesda seemingly using "convenience" as an excuse to try and get a foot in the door with totally unnecessary microtransactions that not only don't change the game in any meaningful way but are going to hurt the game in the long run. Really though, this supposed convenience of being able to repair things directly from your inventory has been a basic feature that's been in not only Fallout for years now, but even further back with the Elder Scrolls games, only now it's implemented worse and is being sold for real world currency.
---
If their intention really was to add value to the game by making it more convenient to play, what they should have done is given an alternative to going back to crafting stations, i.e. letting us repair weapons with duplicates that we scavenge off of enemies all the time with less efficiency. The whole situation to me just reeks of exploitative marketing practice obfuscated with worthless PR talk.
---
Yea from the sheepsquatch questline, the helmets and outfit sell for 5-10k depending the player selling
---
The 'Mr. Fuzzy Hat' is referring to the mining hat, not from the costume obtained from Camden Park. You can find the mining helmet at Quarry X3, near the water's edge are 2 portable toilet's and the hat is in 1 of them.
---
Man that sucks, good luck. I found Horizon 4 to be pretty fun,  also Ghost Recon.
---
I'm not saying it's one or the other. I'm saying they can continue adding better and better cosmetics to the game indefinitely and make more money, without ever having to add something like a repair kit that affects gameplay.  They chose to prioritize repair kits instead.
---
Yeah in the notes you find it on dead tourists, there’s some at uncanny lol
---
Please tell me which consumer rights were violated?
---
Also it was in the burrows , I forgot to mention it forced me to spawn at vault 76 and pay to get back an find that my bag isn’t there. No one else was down there as it seems no one actually cares about the burrows.
---
On the left side of the small cemetery.
---
It is pay to win in the sense that someone paying for repair kits does not need junk, they remove the risk of losing or dropping junk when they die completely from the equation. Someone who is collecting junk to repair their gear is at a distinct disadvantage in that they have more to lose and have to work harder to keep their gear up.
---
Can we just put one of bethesda guys on cross for few second, so they finaly see, we are angry? :D
---
Check again
---
Haven’t seen it yet then since I haven’t done the quest
---
Well that's hardly fair. I only have 31000 hours :(
---
I’ll be sure to check them out for sure, thanks for the recommendations!
---
Okay bethesda needs to do this now cause I wanna see that honestly
---
The mining helmet is in a port-a-potty at the quarry north of watoga sorry i cant recall the exact name.
---
The amount of gymnastics of the mental variety could land you in the Olympics
---
Interesting. I don't see an issue with those types of items being in the Atom Store, either. They don't really sound like "pay to win", just "pay for convenience".
---
But, that's MHO.
---
So what? Are you afraid someone is going to one shot that 3\* legendary before you do? Because they repaired their gun for $0.50? How many times has your weapon broken and you had to go farm materials to fix it while someone else killed a legendary you wanted to kill? Is it more than never? The only time I've ever run out of mats is when I use up a bunch to make ammo.
---
There's no excuse or defending the existence of repair kits.  It's cheap and easy gratification.  The game has been absolutely fine without them, literally nobody pleading for such a quick fix (literally).  It's obvious who does want them and why they are here.
---
At least the camera did come with this update...
---
Def has Good with salt maxed out tho
---
Got em!
---
Don't listen to him!  He's just trying to lure you onto his server so he can dookie in your hat.
---
That sucks. :(
---
If it makes you feel better, the reward was sort of underwhelming.
---
You literally go up to it and select build (I think) then you can move it around. Bizarrely I’ve found that moving it more towards the building border makes you spawn closer to your CAMP, but it could be random!
---
didnt the update just come out with the camera? or did they just post the patch notes
---
...or relieve the building migraine pressure in your head after playing a (short or long) while
---
Very important re-occurring bugs that came back with patch 8:   
---
\- VATS still misses often the first time you VATS with 95% accuracy. Going in and out of VATS fixes this. Vas fixed in 7  
---
\- Dying while overencumbered sometimes forces you to spawn at vault 76. Was fixed long ago.  
---
\- "Nothing is selected" while trying to place items in building mode. Was fixed in 7 (i think)
---
Dead.
---
Who cares about daily, i spend all time since servers gone live searching for that dead guy who starts new camera quest. So many server hops, so many fast travel.....
---
Don’t even have that card
---
My theory is that after Wastelanders (the new story quest) is finished at the end of the year, they will have a kind of grand "relaunch" of 76.
---
Camera location?
---
What previous post of mine?
---
Don’t listen to him ! His pee sac is full lol
---
Oh snap I’m on my way!
---
Oh Im only counting main scrap not beer bottles, deathclaws, and etc and as for aid items only main ones but yea I see your point, just tired of holding enough chems and food on my character to push me to the weight cap if I take my weight reduction perks off.
---
I hope so
---
You sound like one of those "is there a crime, officer? Show me the corpus delicti" guys.
---
If you send my your gt if I find them I can get them. I know vendors for players offer different things!
---
+karma thank you for the gift
---
Most likely the burrows instances aren’t linked to the server instance.  Another example of corner cutting money saving from Bethesda.
---
I'm not buying them. bethesda can get get screwed. fo76 has been a lot of broken promises, I'm sick of it
---
I knew I recognized your name from somewhere [https://youtu.be/zEhGEijRgyU?t=47](https://youtu.be/zEhGEijRgyU?t=47)
---
Yeah I don't see what the big hubbub is. They are offering a non-cosmetic item in the atom shop and it goes against what they said earlier and all that, fine, that's not great. Their explanation for why they're doing it is acceptable imo. Whether they make the promised changes if this ends up being a problem will be determined in the future.
---
But ultimately, as OP said, this doesn't matter to most of us. Repair up to 200%, repair again when your item gets low, don't wait for it to break. Carry backup weapons. Pretty simple RPG element. This is just a way for lazy players to pay for convenience. As long as it's convenience and not a massive advantage (i.e weapon damage boost kit, +explosive modifier kit, etc) I'm fine. Firms make money by providing a *good or service*. The game is a good, convenience is the service.
---
Well. If that's the case, if anyone on Xbox rage quite, i'm in the same boat as this guy. Hit mans up
---
100% sure I was farming specific mats
---
Pete Hines stated before the game released that the Atom shop would be purely cosmetic.
---
They change the wording to competitive in this post, thus moving the bar for what can be included in the shop.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76-microtransactions%3famp
---
I guess the definition of "challenge" has changed?
---
Check your armors bench! It’s hidden in there!
---
I'm gonna guess you combed the whole area, cause things often go back to where they spawned when they die.
---
I like to datamine to put it simply. let me get home before I send you the stuff I found, I have a lot of screenshots
---
Yup it’s been since the server got online trying to find this corpse
---
That is when they're not busy spawning inside of staircases and walls :P
---
Im going to get a few just for my grognaks axe.
---
Directly north is Quarry X3. Checking now.
---
Still works for me
---
Lots of locations. One is near the Watoga sign, and near Hemlock holes
---
Same with me I spent half an hour debating which amount of atoms to buy just in the end for me to say ‘nah I’ll do the challenges’ 😂😭
---
As a counter point, I've found probably a dozen TSE weapons, but my "set" of unyielding gear consists of a mismatched collection of 1 star pieces because that's all I've been able to find.
---
The camera? I found it on a dead tourist in the parking lot outside Wavy Willard’s. I took some server hoping but a body should be leaning on the car parked in the handicap spot.
---
Fortunately the rewards are crap so you probably just missed out on a drill, a syringer and a level 5 wooden leg with mutant legendary.
---
 Here's a solution for everyone upset by the repair kits:
---
I guess you're right, but at least then I'd have a way to stockpile food. Right now I'm running dogfood
---
Yep and ppl like you who keep defending those practices are why they get away with it.
---
Oh they are aware and unhappy, have you been following youtube at all? Or any other site that talks about fallout 76 at all?
---
I have him on my server at Wavy Willard’s. My gamer tag is Icepantz.
---
Hey stop it you two, my kids still believe in both, so stop saying they are not real.  :)
---
Let's see if you can do some math. If you're missing out on 10 atoms a day that means you're completing the rest for 50. Let's say you you played for 30 days, surprisingly that's 1500 atoms. Wow, those atoms could buy you the plague walker skin. Stop focusing on on the small change you're missing out on when you can still clear the other 85% of your daily atoms.
---
Real talk, why do you want to support this kind of action? Being apathetic to it is just as bad as supporting it. I mean can you not see where this leads to down the line? The message it sends to them that it is ok to backtrack on promises made?  I get you are trolling, but why troll this?
---
FINALLY! I can't wait until they cycle to the War and Death ones, I NEED them.
---
So long as they leave a reasonable way in game to get them, let them. If some whale wants to spend $50 in repair kits, *that means the game lasts that much longer*. People have a habit now of mourning lost online games, but mere weeks before they they weren't playing and hadn't paid a dime in years, and somehow never drawing the connection.
---
Servers cost money, bug fixes cost money, content costs money. So if some schmuck wants to buy repair kits and gets to shoot things longer without taking a break, and if Bethesda decides to accommodate that for the sake of more of the above, and if we can just earn the damned things ourselves without paying or better yetjust ignore it and spend *five minutes* doing it ourselves, jolly good, because that's far better than shuttered servers or unchanged content.
---
If this was a gun, or armor, or a stat boost, or something that actually has a meaningful effect on the only part of this game that involves competition (PvP), then I could understand and possibly agree with the outrage, but not for this repair kit garbage.
---
I enjoy the scavenging and repair process, personally, and I think the maintenance costs are too generous if anything. On the other hand, some people would rather skip that part of the cycle and play a pure looter-shooter. 
---
Repair kits (and other ideas like ammo converters and fridges) seem like an attempt to keep both groups happy. It probably won't work, but then the game's an experiment.
---
Oh shit! Nice. Did it give you the quest as well?
---
Thank you the detailed answer ever :D
---
Found at Wavy Willards, straight toward entrance from.fast travel slot, leaning against a car in parking lot, named ansel
---
YEP, I was so close to charging my card and then I decided against it, better decision if you ask me lol
---
Haha XD it's all good. Glad I could assist.
---
Thanks! I removed the bodies head btw so people dont have to see his ugly mug
---
No fucking way did you two just bump into each other on here like that haha
---
Exactly
---
A W E S O M E "Bethesda plz..." thread!  :)
---
Don't forget the 22 hours, you can't short-change them...
---
I do love that they have a way for you to earn your micro transaction funds, a lot of games don’t do that anymore
---
Yes definitely, now I’m debating about the weapons you get from the survival mode challenges 😂
---
I lol’d :-)
---
Yup, there’s a new section in the workbench to modify.
---
It's totally going to. There were already people on the verge of burnout or just coming back to the game, this is the decision they will use to leave permanently on. There will be people who will stay and even people who buy the kits, but 70% of the group I started this game with will let their account die on the repair kit hill and never come back now. They are already off playing games like Division 2 because of the way Bethesda has handled content.
---
If you think circle jerking on Reddit is standing up for something I'll lend you that map.
---
the X-01 power armor mods are only sold by the Enclave vendor.  XBox GT = Dragonninja812
---
Yeah i saw what the reward was but it sucks when you cant complete a challenge because game issues.
---
Very Vault-tec from Bethesda tbh.
---
I will never use one of these. I repair my shit to 200 percent and to repair it to 150 is just not going to do it for me. I'll be getting these from the SBQ no doubt but I'll be destroying them. I carry 2 Cryolaters, if one breaks I got a back up, no need for half assed repair kit
---
ROFL, Yup that is why you haven't actually answered anything I said even to point out this supposed contradiction.
---
Yea, ok, but I do think it was 5 of 7 days with camera dailys, and some days (if not all of them) had 2 camera dailys
---
Dont even know why this is bothering me so much. Its just so amateur hour. I mean, I get that they probably plan the dailys weeks ahead, but still, after delaying the camera for 2 weeks, nobody had the the bright idea of saying "Maybe we should adjust the dailys too?"
---
If this happened in an indie game made by 2 guys, ok, things fall through the cracks, but this is a Triple A company, yes?
---
We did. That's awesome too!  Does anyone know how to find people on here based on IGN?  Is that possible since people have different names on here sometimes?  I played yesterday with Zappafan, I need to chat with him or her.
---
Does one mod work on both legs or do you need a separate mod for each leg?
---
Heck, dovthe mod boxes I  your stash disappeare aftervthey are used or are they permanent?
---
I tittered irl
---
I’ve seen that a few times...lol
---
Really? I’ve tried logging on different worlds. Complete excavator set on. And I’m not getting the bonus when entering world. I guess I’ll keep trying. Anyone else working for them?
---
Outside? Is that a new video game? Those graphics look pretty sweet
---
Mental gymnastics? It shows an X-01 model, you get the X-01 model. That's not mental gymnastics, that's being able to take two steps without face planting.
---
Hope not that would be a big downer
---
I’ve spent about 200 caps trying to do this. Getting pretty tiresome
---
Thank you for five paragraphs that boil down to "I know better, wake up, sheeple."
---
Cool omw!
---
I just bought one of [these repair kits](https://i.imgur.com/40DQCki.jpg).  I can't carry a spare in my trunk, so this might come in handy one day.
---
Yeah, Reddits a tricky place to tackle. I once asked if Rifle build is better than heavy, and I got downvoted! No idea how, it was just a question but I guess that's how people work. Somewhere out there, someone will bone to pick a fight.
---
Mods should have been fixed sooner, that was pretty unacceptable, and heh dunno if you saying you can make ammo is sarcasm or not, I've never dabble with prime recievers or ammo, just know they can cost quite the flux to make XD
---
oh i should have clarified. sorry thats just me being dumb. so the way that the pipe weapons work is that the pistol keyword is on the weapon themselves while the energy weapons have the pistol keyword on the grip and not on the weapon. the grips for all of these do an ADD with the rifle keyword for the non standard grips. And you just got me to dig even further into the data and you are actually right. this doesnt work with the regular pipe pistol. i was mistaken and thought i had seen the keyword on the weapon for that one. the revolver and bolt action do actually have the keyword on the base weapon.
---
Agree! I suggest for future quest lines don't make us server hop to start them. Waste of time.
---
For real.
---
For everyone’s attention: the body is randomized. One possible location aside from WWW is Miners Monument.
---
i prefer variance, Harpoon gun, .50 cal., Minigun, Cryolator, Missile Launcher, Fatman, Auto Nade for me
---
Glad you could get in! If you could hop to a different server after so other could get a chance that would be greatly appreciated!
---
Pee sac 😂😂🤣
---
Idk but I taking my cannibal perk off now. 🤮
---
Did it just to see and it still works....
---
Did I miss something or is the bunny head new?
---
I think they are just a glutton for punishment. I agree that they should be able to monetize on the game but within the realm of their promises. People eat up those power armor skins. Even if some of them look like trash. I eat up the combat armor skins but I’d love to see skins for the rest of the armors too. They just need to make cosmetics that people would want to buy.
---
Such as some people like the oversized goofy heads. I’d rather have a normal sized head and have different themes. Cosmetics are totally doable but I think that their creativity is being challenged to much or there’s poor management in graphic design. I’d rather pay for the DLCs vs. have in game boost items, if money is an issue. But they also promised that the DLCs would be free.
---
What corpse with bunny head on it?
---
If In Xbox there’s a guy holding the spot for people GT.
---
Dookieinyourhat
---
Just dookie filled hats
---
Thank you very much, my friend’s queued to join right now :)
---
The only real way is by profile, if you look at mine i have my gamertag as like my mini name or whatever it is, "idezarc" try searching it and see if my profile loads up under "users"?
---
Ok. I can play at 5pm ET if that works
---
It’s in the tinkerers workbench, you can modify and repair it there.
---
Well, there's my first big disappointment with this game. Tsk tsk. It would have been a simple thing to put the basic repair kits as a plan in game but you chose to not go that route.
---
Thanks for the flash backs to dead island lol.
---
ever since I first walked to megaton and looked at the junk pile next to the main gate, I have always wanted a Bathtub mobile.
---
There are plenty of empty tubes, tires, rods, and engines that throwing these together could make an awesome yet silly post apocalyptic vehicle. 
---
If i can make craft advance pieces of power armor with jet packs and Tesla shocks on it, why cant I make my bathtub mobile
---
ive always had the calibrated shocks on my Excavator
---
That plague walker skin looks pretty dope.
---
You saw the pictures... Every other paint set that includes the other power armor sets also has pictures of those.
---
Those Nukashine skins look clean as fuck. I was not that impressed with just the X-01 that leaked a while back but seeing that there are versions for the other PA models has me very interested.
---
yea... Has he not logged in and seen all the cool additions? I don't get the massive upset over this...
---
Wisdom
---
Thanks so much!
---
Imagine if they repaired power armour :o
---
Um...that does not mean you are not crazy, it could be mass hysteria, or you could all be affected the same crazy effect inducing chemical agent.  Just thought you would want to know.
---
I just found him at Wavy Willards car park slumped against one of the cars.
---
Wait a minute, it's only on the X01 ?
---
Wtf it clearly says "Can be equipped on the Escavator, Raider, T-45 , T-51, T-60 , Ultracite and X-01 Power armor."
---
Thanks, but not online right now :/
---
Can you explain where in the water park the body is located, so i know where to look later ? :)
---
Already done. It's been uninstalled for almost an hour now!
---
You are missing the point. With these kits you never need to collect or risk losing junk, ever.
---
It provides a way to circumvent the biggest chore in the game, collecting junk. 
---
It totally removes the primary penalty of death in pvp, dropping junk. 
---
It totally removes reward for engaging the risk of fighting an opponent in pvp for the victor.
---
This changes the game in ways you haven't even considered yet.
---
It's not a bug. That's the only 'plague rider' model in the game files.
---
Well I'm glad you seem uneasily offended.
---
Thank you. I am still new to reddits UI
---
ESO never explicitly stated that the MT shop would remain cosmetic only.
---
just one :)
---
You can craft it
---
In the parking lot out front next to rusted out car in center of parking lot
---
Went through a bigillian stimpacks and later had to repair everything all after dying a few times to get a white fedora hat...🙄 lol
---
I forgot that I also have a broadsider, but never carry ammo for it..but each gatling has it's own purpose and has served me well over my last 60ish levels
---
Forcing server hops *for any reason* is an indication of a broken system. The act only helps add to server instability, so you think it would be near the top of their list of things to address.
---
can someone post the full ini? what i need to copy paste? i broke my ini
---
First they nerfed White Knight and messed with the whole durability/repair cost system.
---
Now they are trying to shove those repair kits down your throat.
---
Make no mistake, it's not "utility". It's a paid method of fixing what was intentionally broken. They created a problem just to sell you a solution. This is probably the ugliest thing gamedev could do. 
---
And just a reminder: it's not a free-2-play game. It's a full cost game. You paid $60 for it.
---
But... do the stats change to that of x-01 or are they that of the original PA the skin is on? If the stats change, its broken. If they don't , well then, it's exactly what it says it is. A skin.
---
Will continue to hold it for a little while. It’d be cool if y’all could grab and go, if you wanna stay and chat a minute that’s fine too but I want to be able to get it for as many people as I can and I can’t with a full server &lt;3
---
I’ll join PSN QuicksilverK
---
Ammosmith, which increases the quantity of ammo crafted and works on the new camera's film, in this case 12 film to 21 film.
---
Mothman the Flame thrower
---
When i see people in silo i join them and when i see they have problems i pull then thru and let them fire it. So no, worse is, when people don't launch nukes at all.
---
How much does film weigh?
---
Got you marked down if I find them!
---
You have been staring at the lamp too long bub.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
It took me 5 hops
---
Nice, now take your first steps outside into the real world, it's almost at the same as stepping out of the vault for the first time!
---
Not at all, it can get tough
---
It turns them into the model for the X-01.
---
Currently queued...
---
100% a skin; my T-60 used in the example image still has it's T-60 stats.
---
I've noticed a lot of regression after the last-last update too.
---
Anyone notice how different the scenery backround loads while you're walking? It's like you can see a second semi-transparent image over the trees that shifts around before finally settling.
---
Also, as others have commented on, your camp loads super slow, and I also noticed that power connector pilons create an extreme lag whenever you load them up while in the converted munitions factory, just the connector pilons which is weird.
---
They also nerfed WhiteKnight, for a reason.
---
I would definitely recommend only having a small hidden base (no walls etc), just use what you need at the time and store the things you don't. I find its pretty easy to not be found as are can't be seen on the map (if you don't want to be) so it's pretty unlikely tha
---
The amount of "quality control testing" happening before release is laughable. Come on.
---
OMG, shut up already.
---
I have no mods and I was seeing...make that not seeing... some items in the shop since the patch last week.  Seemed to be temporary and random.
---
It's simple. . . Before you go out repair anything that needs repairing. . .
---
When have they given out any DLC? You going to try to claim the burrows counts as DLC? ROFL, so you'd have paid for that?
---
Learnt is past tense and past participle of the verb learn. It's more common to see its use in British English than American English. But, yes, learned is more common. Though the colloquial, learnt, would be appropriate in this venue.
---
You're going to procrastinate until the last 21 hours, aren't you.
---
I haven’t Even looked into that what’s that about?
---
2 legs ,2 mods
---
The mods are no longer in the stach box
---
So I had this issue and I was able to fix it my making sure 5e game was not installed on an external drive.  Move it to the internal one and it should work fine.
---
Bethesda hates us ;(
---
The only situation where I can see the utility of repair kits is post-nuke launch. If my weapon(s) are getting low I have the option of either heading immediately to the blast zone so I can be one of the first to start farming, or traveling back to my camp to repair and potentially missing out on a big chunk of enemies.  
---
I guess I could technically backtrack through the silo to hit the various benches, but that's a pain in the butt and opens me up to all the turrets I ran past in the first place.
---
It's ridiculously stupid how they've made this quest start.
---
You know, it is a little mad, a little paper pad weighs more than a steel bar, which is hilarious when you think about it
---
Nah, but I’d count the brewing stuff, Pioneer Scout stuff, The Wastelander Update later on, etc. Not some subpar world space with only 25+ enemies.
---
Oh
---
BAH BAH HAHAHAHA! "Dear Todd Howard, please present yourself to Reddit so we can cast you into the flames of our fury. Promise we'll be respectful, like all the other times."
---
Here, let me explain the reasons things changed: Businesses run on money. If they don't make enough money to be sustained, things change. If you know they won't make enough money ahead of time, you change them ahead of time to try and avoid future problems. But actually telling people "We can't do this for free forever" is incredibly unpopular, and single time purchases of cosmetics that take effort to create is generally not sustainable, especially when many folks just keep plaguing to earn the resource needed, so you say as little as you can and just get it done.
---
If you're not *incompetent*, it takes five minutes to do what you could be paying $0.50 to have done for you.
---
"But Daddy, Bethesda LIED to me!" You see, Jimmy, adults often have to lie to children, because they react so poorly to the truth. Daddy can't really explain how he just spent his paycheck paying for the house and the food and the TV, but of course, Daddy is terrible for telling you that he'd get you that dolly back when he thought he could afford it, and now you hate them for their horrible lies. Now, some people can't tolerate that sort of thing, and instead take to the internet to yell at their parents, and we call the Redditors.
---
The prime receiver plan for the combat rifle changes it from 45 caliber to 44 caliber and on the bench you can only make 45 which should work. So after making some and looking the rifle had 0 ammo and info said it uses 44 caliber ultracite. 
---
I guess this was a known issue, just didn’t know about it.

0.005 for 1

There’s a challenge each week to do in survival mode and it rewards you with a weapon that you can only get from the challenges

Trying to get some folks to leave and finish the mission so I can hold him
---
Anyone else not have a quest start though?
---
Damn it I only see them having a piss
---
Because its such a hard task repairing a weapon without one. Lazy and I hope it can be drop on death in survival, so I can loot em and drop them where all you douches won't find em.
---
I am still looking for it actually
---
Thats actually really good, do perks effect it?
---
ASSUME  - You just called yourself an ass and me one.  
---
Not once have I defended there practices, I have merely pointed out their information. Just like you have done.
---
I don't assume anything.  But you just assumed that I defend their practices.  I would appreciate it  if you would keep the name calling down.
---
Everyone downvoting this post salty they didn’t get the bunny head
---
Ok yeah it’s still broken then.  Figured as much - sighs!
---
I understand that and there is no excuse for it, nor am I trying to defend the decision.
---
I'm just saying our ire shouldn't be directed at Pete Hines but rather where it is deserved; at the people making these decisions.
---
I often find her corpse in the deep part of the water I had to crouch through the water to find it.
---
Been hopping since the servers went live, nothing yet, if you're on PC i can let you know if I do!
---
That would be pretty cool.
---
I vendor almost everything. I keep the boots supplied with legendaries it feels.
---
I found him on ps4 on my server so add me but just add that you saw this post ;) PSN: AniolZemsty
---
White Knight was nerfed exactly to sell those repair kits. They break a part of game to sell you a fix. You can think it's won't affect you if you don't buy it, but you are wrong. Next time they will nerf another perks to make food spoil faster, or hunger/thirst grow faster, and then they will sell you some Food Kits for Atoms. Then they will cut ammo drop to sell you Ammo Kits. Don't you see the pattern?
---
Happens to me also , I don't hoard legendary gear tho, only thing in my box is junk.
---
I’ve been doing about dialysis in biology, it seems like hell from what we’ve learnt.
---
I cant build any items in my camp, does anyone else experience this?
---
How much do they weigh?
---
Yes I am, will notify you as well in case I get lucky!
---
Alrighty, keep being sad and mad. I'll go on with the opposite.
---
In a way, Fallout 76 is already a Pay2Win game. Do you see how many people are selling Legendaries and mutation serums for cash on eBay?
---
It's a crafty/scrappy challenge:
---
- Craft/Scrap 20 Melee Weapons 
---
- Craft/Scrap 20 Ranged Weapons
---
- Craft 40 energy Ammo
---
- Craft 40 Explosive Ammo
---
- Craft 40 Molotov Cocktails
---
I would had given gold but here’s to you (*)
---
He stayed there for people , came and left we took pictures and we moved on for more people to join
---
I can read. And whether you intention or not. Your comments speak for themselves.
---
Agreed. I love taking pictures but I'm not getting rid of my old ones :/
---
Wow another broken perk.  I guess it was too hopeful that they fixed Class Freak &amp; Rejuvination breaking Adrenal Reaction mutations but now this one......
---
Dear Beth, I am convinced now you have too many 'test' patches out there and you've entangled other code into these test patches, and now you can't just simply extract those test patches from the various servers without breaking other stuff.  Seriously, just work on a brand new server/client code and don't touch anything else, and call it Fallout 5
---
50 atoms is a couple of daily challenges. Add to that the time you say it takes, I'm really not seeing this as P2W (then again, I've not thought that from the get, because I know you run out of carry weight before you run out of condition, and I figured most people fix their shit wherever they go to camp). 
---
Course, I'll likely be told why I'm wrong and a "bethesdrone" or some other such *clever* name. 
---
But eh, is what it is. 
---
Thanks for this info, mate.
---
I just need Nukashine so I can mix it with the X-01 Tricentennial paints already. I'm itching for that skin.
---
[Let me spend my money!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow-WdjzfmaI)
---
What?!.
---
This is fucked up,the least they can do is actually add the skins that looks like the actual armor
---

---
Oh damn... there goes all my caps and stimulate packs
---
I have waaaaay too much stuff to vendor or store lol
---
I’d buy it! That would be pretty funny! lol
---
You sound like a  roaming eyebolt wandering aimlessly, unable to fights it’s need to repeat the same sentence over and over again until it’s finally trashed for its useful items
---
Thanks for those details!
---
Just tried bandolier and it does not, unfortunately. But its light af so I understand it
---
Yeah, still cool. Thanks for letting me know
---
&gt; So when you have a majority of the player base
---
If you think the crowd of autistic screeching basement dwellers on reddit is a "majority of the player base" you're delusional.
---
So you've learned nothing over the past few months.. You guys are burning thru so much good will without remorse it's fucking staggering. Honestly, it hurts to see this happening to a company I used to love. You're just going to ignore all the 'turn back now' signs and drive of a cliff.. This is going to come back to haunt you with the release of the next Fallout/Elder Scrolls game, I hope you guys finally realise that.. :(
---
Can you Connect it to your one drive and upload?
---
Maybe? My total Atoms currently ends with a 2.
---
Yeh I give up on that quest a while back.. Body kept disappearing and when and no one else does fuck all damage. I swear people still don't understand that they need to turn the pylons on.
---
Agreed. It reeks of two things to me: 1. lack of thought. There is sooo much lack of thought across so much of this game. Which is probably caused by... 2. Overworked and underbudgeted teams. It really feels like there are literally 2-3 people employed to bug fix and stay across maintenance issues generally.
---
True. But everyone also lost their mind when they said potions and repair kits would be in the store. And guess what? No one buys them and they fill loot boxes and the game wasn't effected, at all.
---
This is the best response I’ve seen to this issue on any thread. It’s intelligent, clear, and in no way toxic. Too many people come off as spoiled crybabies and their point is missed or ignored completely. Which is too bad, because despite my desire to defend Bethesda here, I think there is a valid point to be made. 
---
Did you know that you can repair your weapons before they break?
---
Yes keep putting your head in the sand and ignore whats really happening. Good luck with that. 👍
---
I legitimately do this, and is why I commented this 😂
---
I didn't?  I just fast traveled to the listed places that it might spawn.  Didn't hop one time
---
I took too much of them in last 500hours of gameplay, so i know your pain, i was already deleting then because take photo naked challenges.....
---
[deleted]
---
I must have done at least ten sever hops visiting all five locations and found nothing
---
No im laughing at you. 
---
you are terrible at Trolling. Why would i be crying at a lone wanker on reddit who has regurgitated the same shill comment to lots of people in a thread. No im burning you.
---
Stop thinking so highly of yourself , your first comment was calling me an idiot over a comment you didn't understand because you're a Dumb cunt,, you then get burned and every reply since has been strawman like your a Robco robot with a Bethesda branded Dildo in every orifice.
---
Everything you say is wack, every insult is wack. you're dog shit for a Troll.
---
Insult bot is more insulting than you..
---
" Entitled fuck " haha.
---
No company cares about the fans for long. Even the best of intentions eventually give way to the desire to get paid. This is the way the world works - with a handful of small exceptions of course. 
---
No one should be surprised that a game company has shown a desire to make money regardless of what they said. If you didn’t see this coming, you had blinders on
---
I see it adding no significant benefit in a "win" situation, if anything, the time it takes to use could result in a net *loss.*
---
I could be wrong, but every PVP I've (grudgingly) been in is over in seconds. Plus, 200% at a bench, kits in loot that repair to 150%, I'm just not seeing this as P2W.
---
That's me, YMMV.
---
I've got all 6 eggs. How do we redeem the reward. Wasn't really stated that I remember
---
I can transfer them on flash drive, or directly upload to facebook, but if you delete them ingame, u will never see it again while loading.
---
Deleting them ingame doesn't delete them from your hdd, if that helps?
---

---
Oh they flip out, or some laugh their ass off. Either way it's a good time, and I lose nothing 😎👉👉
---
Same, the Cranberry Moonshine recipe is one I'm missing still. I'm on PC and willing to trade a duplicate recipe for this recipe.
---
Yeah, that's how it seems. Pick on the lady --or low levels-- because they can't beat other dudes in survival so they have to prove how badass/manly they are by murdering people that have no hope of defending themselves or winning.
---
Bethesda reminds me of a greedy corporation you’d see in a Fallout game.
---
Didn’t they limit server hopping?
---
If it sells like hotcakes, it means the game is still likely to exist a year from now. Games as a service live or die on recurring revenue.
---
The advantage comes from the immediacy and the situation. It isn’t meant to repair to the same standard as you can do with perks at a workbench, it does it there and then instantly. 
---
So, if you’re in a situation where your gun breaks you could evade, run off, hide, fast travel once clear, repair at CAMP and go back or, select repair kit, done.
---
Yep still here. Will hold it for a little bit
---
Purchasing atoms is how this game gets supported and how we continue to be able to enjoy new content. We should purchase atoms. But it should be because there is quality content that we want. Not because of utilizing shady techniques like limited time items. Or pay2convenience. IMO that is just as bad as pay2win. Because that means the game is made to be more tedious and less fun if you don’t pay money.
---
Definitely agree on PvP. Unless the other guy is an expert at hiding in a PvP "seeking revenge" scenario, I don't see the benefit.
---
Repair kits can suck ma nutz
---
Listed where?
---
From what i understand you were sopposed to get it on the final day
---
Nope, they said they were wanting to add, being able to access your stash anywhere anytime, fridge to stop food from spoiling, etc. 
---
This definitely isn't a slippery slope when they already tell you they are wanting to go that route.
---
same here, there are so many locations where you can find it that it should be more than enough on one server. i found it at the third listed location where i went to look for it
---
Even if it didn't offer an overpowered loophole like overencumbered travel, it'd be neat if it was like the power armor; it weighs 10 or 15 pounds in your inventory, you deploy it, and it gives you an extra amount of weight for your inventory. It could be customized/upgraded, maybe reduce caps for traveling, etc.
---
Plus, it could have different decorative skins (cough cough Atom revenue)
---
I made a similar comment a couple weeks ago -  someone else here replied (PS4s) save all photos taken in game to the PS4 level photo/screen capture folder, and they remain there even if you delete them from game photos.
---
Disclaimer: I'm lazy at times, so haven't gotten around to verifying it.
---
&gt; Comments: &lt;a dozen downvoted examples&gt;
---
More like: &lt;a dozen hypothetical situations that would almost never happen &gt;
---
Seriously, what are the odds that 2 people are going to be in a PvP battle and both have their guns break at the same time, which then gives the guy with a repair kit an advantage? Every one of these examples is just fucking ridiculous nonsense that won't happen to 99.999% of players.
---
I agree. the game tells us when enemy A.I is getting ready to attack so I see no reason it can't warn us if someone is claiming the workshop, and allow us to just give it up to that person or fight it out.
---
Server hopping should never be the only option, that just screams of poor decision-making.
---
I take it broken cameras don't count? I found one in uncanny caverns but it didn't start the quest
---
I just tested it on my revolutionary sword and it took it to 200%. I dont have a 2 handed to test it on though
---
those aren’t endorsed by Bethesda, they can’t control what 3rd parties do
---
Anyone else notnhave the bucket list quest come up?
---
PC?
---
Man, I've defended companies for ages, or at least the development studios under them. Bethesda, Bungie, BioWare, Blizzard, I grew up with their games. They built my childhood, in a sense. I feel a sense of loyalty because of that.
---
However, at some point there has to be a line, a point at which you take a step back and say, "I love the games this company makes, but a time will come where I can't anymore if I keep defending this nonsense."
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
It’s a full repair that’s a lot of material for me to not bitch about
---
&gt;Yeah, it's stupid the way handled it. Whoever is in charge of PR really needs a brush up on there skills, as this subject was a hot subject on this platform as well as others and they should have handled it differently.
---
So my comment on the PR dose not speak VOLUMES on how I feel about it???  And the practice of businesses changing is not a new concept, they were doing this before you wore born.
---
Not sure if the NPC or positioning is different, but going off the Colonel Kelly one, I found a male tourist at the "peak" of the monument hill. Opposite to the actual memorial at the top, a decaying man wearing a red baseball cap and bright blue shirt laying dead on their back across one of the two benches.
---
What is this "Go Outside" you speak of? Is this a new fad??
---
I never do what Reddit tells me.

As I've said before, it's an advantage to effectively get free ballistic fiber - for example
---

---
Huh well, you're not the only one , I guess I didn't now that either!
---
Why not just wear a live Yao Gai on your back...you'll then hit like a truck too.
---
I’ll likely be on all day today and will try not to leave the server.
---
Not needing to spend 5 intelligence to run gunsmith because repairing your gun is instant with the repair kits on hotkey. So they have access to more special points to spend on other perks such as dps boosts, or tank boosts.  That is an advantage.
---
Last night many of the things I shot in a cave or house flew through the wall never to be seen again. :(
---
No prob.
---
The kits only work on weapons and armor, so AFAIK there's nothing you can repair with these kits that would require flux.
---
Let's be real. The vast majority of people who play this game aren't as involved as we are. Even if you include all the social media channels most of them have no idea what's going on or may not even care. While we are the voice of these people as we are the.loudests, it only takes a few whales to make this profitable.  since the launch interest wave passed it's not really profitable for big influencers to pick up this kind of story. Bethesda can basically do whatever they want and the game is going south at a much faster rate. Mark my words, the atomic shop will have refrigerators, backpacks, junk supplies and maybe companions and even serums by next year.
---
You still got him?
---
Waterpark parking lot I hear
---
I did copy photos on flash drive since beta times, but once you delete photo ingame, you will never see it again on loading screen.
---
It's not p2w *yet*. If they're well recieved, or even make a decent amount of money, they could increase weapon/armour degradation, this making them a necessity. I'm not saying this will definitely happen, but I'd rather do everything possible to ensure it doesn't, than simply say it doesn't matter and ignore it.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, he has stuck the landing.
---
Well thank you sir
---
You've had a bit too much hallucigen gas, but other posts say the same thing
---
My man.
---
Ooh, I came here for camera locations but this is really good to know. Nice!!
---
Who are these people burdened by their weapons or armor constantly breaking? With things like Weapon Artisan and the various reduced degradation perks, I just don't understand how this is a problem.
---
I have a hard time finding adhesive for repairs.  I will use these repair kits for when I wanna go out and adventure and not worry about finding duct tape.
---
Good idea. Most people love a fresh corpse to rummage through. I know I do!
---
A video of this would be flippin’ awesome! Haha!
---
Yeah. I felt the same way for a long time. But honestly as I get older, and see how the world really works, I can see that there really is no reason to be surprised a gaming company goes back on a promise and decides to try and make some money. With just a few very rare exceptions, I would say all developers are eventually going to be in it for the money
---
Very well then. Have a good day.
---
This is usually good advice.
---
It says 0/10 but when I go to add an item... It says no slots available even though it's empty.
---
Not sure what's being misunderstood.
---
Simply listed everything I've tried to be able to use my fermenter and it's empty but glitched to say it's full.
---
Why thank you, that's one of the very few places I haven't been. Going there tonight.
---
My favorite is opening the door to the train station and seeing into oblivion. Door closes, open it again....and now there’s a room.
---
Free ballistic fiber at the cost of -30 DR on your armor is not an advantage.
---
Increase has been asked for since launch...
---
But they added the repair kits because the community requested those.........
---
Good fucking Lord
---
I don't know where you are on your search for code pieces, but I found a few for silo Charlie.
---
G-7, H-7, S-7, V-4, Y-6
---
Hope these help!
---
What's the tourist?
---
Who are u trying to convince here? Cause its surely not me.
---
No matter how other companies do their business or how they change will ever change the fact that Bethseda is now liars.
---
And no matter if business’s do it or not. DOES NOT MAKE IT RIGHT
---
Most people will not need them, they are there for emergencies and people who don't have time or want to farm. They are a great addition to the game and I hope we see more minor utilities like them. Cosmetics are fun, but ultimately worthless in my opinion. I personally would never pay money for cosmetics , and I'm sure I'm not alone.
---
Nothing will go in.
---
Even nukashine.
---
0/10 but says no slots available when trying to add a fermentable item.
---
And water showed in the fermenter at one point. This is when the glitch occurred.
---
have never been to the pvp mode, when you spawn, is your camp there just like in the pve world ?
---
brb gonna try this right now
---
Even when you know what you're doing and have a finished build, silos are a lot easier if you have one player to do quest stuff and another for crowd control. The robots continually spawn in some of the stages, so taking your time isn't a good option.
---
Tip: Use the lockpick + hacking bypass on the reactor room. Repairing the reactor used to work fine, but it kept lagging out last time I tried.
---
the only one here thats an actual quest is order of the tadpole. st valentines day massacre either wont happen till next year or wont happen at all. mission: accessible is a test quest used for testing scene quests. green hills of appalachia is another test quest this one used for testing fetch quests. having a blast is yet ANOTHER test quest (read the editor id to see which are test quests and which arent).
---
Then look at any other definition out for it. They all say the same thing as the UD definition. P2W is any item/boost/buff or anything else you can purchase with money that gives you an advantage in the game other players don't have access to.
---
So the fact that they can just hotkey the repair kit to instantly repair their shit means they can spend special points into other perks than gunsmith because they don't worry at all about weapon durability.
---
Its out. A friend just killed it. (The real one)
---
Yeah, it's the same game world except you can get killed by randoms and no players show up on the map (unless they are in the top 3 kills)
---
&gt; shot up in to the air
---
Now I want to try this.
---
Checking now one sec
---
ohmygod these are SO COOL
---
Odd that War Rider's not in there though
---
It is not a static spawn spot.
---
&gt;	what this means for the future of the game 
---
Existing? If the game doesn’t bring money, the game gets shut down, that much is pretty clear.
---
Wavy Willard's Water Park. The tourist is in the car park by the red car. You might have to server hope to find the body
---
Who said anything about menus? These can be hotkeyed...
---
Im on my 12th server hop lol
---
Did you just want the CHALLENGES handed to you? They are supposed to be a bit...gasp!...challenging. 
---
Of all the things to be entitled about
---
Yay! Tired of server hopping!
---
Every time I see a downed satellite I hope that an eye 👁 starts looking around. And that I’ll warp me across the land the BigMT

There are 2 basic versions hemodialysis which most people have to go into the dialysis clinic 3 days a week to get their blood filtered. They are hooked up to the machines for 4 to 6 hours each time. When done, they feel run down, no appetite and basically just want to get home and go to bed. There 8s a version of hemodialysis that can be done at home, but you have to have a very clean home, no pets, and basically need a sterile room. I don't know much more about home hemodialysis. I did Peritoneal Dialysis at home. Also known as PD dialysis, it is done on a daily basis and you have a port inserted into the peritoneum lining in your abdomen. When going to bed or whenever you are home long enough to do the entire process, you hook up and will be hooked up for 6 to 12 hours every night. Most people I believe are in the 7 to 9 hour range. It is nice because you get to sleep in your own bed, you don't have to deal with clinics 3 days a week. Also for reasons I am not clear on the process at the clinics is just brutal and very tiresome to most. By doing it at home, you are more comfortable and other than the tubes, which you get used to very quickly, you have a normal night's sleep. Unfortunately, not everyone can do the PD, or after many years, it can become less effective. Once that happens you have to go the hemodialysis treatments. It sucks big time, but better to do that than to give up in my opinion.
---
Anyone test it with super duper?
---
Torble
---
Yeah they did promise DLC's would be free, but looking at ESO, it has changed from their DLC promises of being free, instead they called them chapters, and heh I can see this happening with this game, but I guess if they're really good, like Far Harbour, Nuka World Lonesome road good, I wouldn't fully mind paying, but they still better do the every now and then content drop season!
---
And yep, better cosmetics! They have been improving steadily, with a couple ups and downs, but if they want money they need to step up their game! They have data! Find the guns used the most, release lots of skins for them! That'll make cash! Gold and silver Handmade skins have been found in the atomic shop data mining ages ago, and yet they still haven't sold them, but  a gold skin for a .44 Magnum revolver, which isn't that popular, since it does less damage than a Western revolver, which is more popular? Bit of a loss in my eyes I think!
---
The marketing team who does these stuff really need to get out of their little office burrows and see the light of the "Bethesda Please" posts for atomic shop items XD
---
It does not effect me at all. I could not care less.
---
I have 100% protection against fall damage due to two limbs having the 50% damage reduction.  I'll have to try this.
---
Alright, sent a friend request.
---
I joined someone who has it, IGN Ryanc229
---
Welcome.
---
Even if i place one of those new signs saying, keep out, private property , etc.. etc.. ? lol
---
Anyway, thanks for the info, could use a low level character i have (a lv26), not so much to loos. and a small camp :)
---
The world is full
---
yeah that happenes to me alot, like having acid flashbacks in game heheh
---
maybe nukashine flashbacks?
---
Paying a monthly sub for WoW was known from launch. So I didn't have to consider how much ~more~ the game would cost, I ~knew~ from the start. They were open about it.
---
Also, Fortnite is a F2P game for the part that made it famous (BR). Most people have no problem with F2P games having cash shops, as far as I've seen. But this is not a F2P game, and its cosmetics-only promise has now become utility, gameplay-affecting items. So you're giving me apples to my oranges.
---
As far as Bethesda making money 'one way or another', I'll take the way that involves honesty and integrity, not the way that involves breaking promises or compromising gameplay (albeit in a very slight way... to start). 
---
I don't let businesses in real life get away with lying to me or changing their minds to counterbalance their mistakes. I see no reason why I should let a video game seller do that now.
---
That's not how PSA works dude.
---
They also don't have to spend any points of their build into perk cards to limit damage their gear takes, so no need to run 5 gunsmith. They can run 5 more perks for damage or tankiness.
---
That is an advantage not having to care about durability of your gear because you can fix it on the fly at any time.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgjlng/dat\_mined\_camera\_spawns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgjlng/dat_mined_camera_spawns/)
---
You guys on still?
---
Gamers are so melodramatic about literally everything. You say in yout own post that you don't even care if it offers an advantage, that this is all some constructed moral outrage over the gaming industry being too sacred for capitalism or some ridiculous fairy-tale nonsense.
---
Please add me, I'm getting a lot of requests so it's easier this way.
---
Maybe. But the revolver one has been there for a few weeks or a month at least.  Maybe it did just unlock and I saw another. I’ll check when I load back up.
---
Just did this... thank you for finding a method that you can fast travel for free hahaha
---
Have you  noticed how many dailies also require you to server hop for 1 hour? Now the new content. Something is odd
---
If they run quickly enough through the field, the grass won't have time to load, and if they're really lucky, the bag will.
---
Thanks god. Gonna add you!
---
yeah
---
I hope, the relish tasted good.
---
The easier method is to go into the updated FO76.ini, copy the entire line of file names, and then paste it into your custom ini.
---
Thx &lt;3 fast traveled there just to see if I could
---
Server disconnected. Will find again!
---
Lawl np I didnt even check to see if you dropped anything
---
Whenever I am scanning the map for the next event, for me to do, i check to see if there are any lower levels hanging out at the entrance of Vault 76. 
---
If i got plans to drop, I fast travel to 76, flag them down, and give them the goods.
---
Would do just for footage
---
The raider bot at the ski lodge and whitesprings raider usually have one of the raider under armors. Harness looks the best imo, plus you can find resistant plans which boosts your perception by 1 and agility by 2 for something like 7 ballistic and some leather.
---
But if the photos show only the X-01 armor, how are we supposed to know that the fake X-01 is actually T-45?
---
yes! i  made a post just about this but it was lost in the repair kit uprising earlier today
---
Reply for karma :)
---
Sorry about the late reply, I have been moving recently with out time for Reddit, but the story is very cool and it's the kind of story telling the game needs
---
Hahaha I love that! I may try this out!
---
Ok, but then Nov 2 which was before release they changed it to competitive. Why are people mad?
---
I'm in too gt kittielickie
---
Better yet, chug a nukashine first, then do this....
---
You just proved these repair kits are pay 2 win. With these kits they don't have to run any of those perks about item degradation, because they can just fix it on the fly if it does break in the middle of the fight.
---
The reason I went that way is that I had some pistols already I'd collected. I've got 1 TSE, 2x AAE and 1x VampE ... 10mm.  They don't break all that often if you use Weapon Artisan and over-repair them (esp. the TSE). The TSE I use generally, an AAE for super mutants / SB / SBQ and VampE for times I find I'm running low on health too quickly (Sheepsquatch). Generally though, I'm a bomber and also carry at least one grenade launcher at all times. I have a few single-shot M79s (both have limb damage as the secondary I think; one is Executioner and one is Suppressor or something) and one decent AGL (forget wht the first is, second is fire rate). I've also moved 3 Bunker Busters over as well, but I'm not using Missiles much these days and those are freakishly heavy so sit in my stash.
---
Queen Fights ... I've primed one of the AAEs for queen fights, and mostly stand right in her face or close to it.
---
More specifically though, here's generally what I do.
---
* If she's flying, I keep putting rounds in her w/ the AAE
---
* If I happen to have a Bunker Buster and missiles on me, I shoot her w/ the Bunker Buster (tracking) until it breaks while she's flying. Even over repaired it's only going to get you 50-60 missiles max.
---
* When she lands, AAE and toss grenades / mines. I use mines as short-range grenades. Unless I'm really hurt and as long as I don't have too much Adrenaline built up I can take a Nuke Mine at my own feet.
---
* Tesla Coils tags everything around you if your grenades don't.
---
* If there are lots of spawns, I stop shooting and just dump Nuka grenades and Nuke Mines in the area (making sure to get her in the blast too)
---
I'm a \*bit\* low on stims right now, so Sheepsquatch is a bit tricky as I generally like to take at least one conduit. Until I build up stims a bit more, I'm hesitant to take a conduit on this character but if I do it's the Vamp E as much as I can, as well as carpet bombing (ideally w/ the AGL).
---
I view grenades as the big dump resource for boss fights. I use them off and on in general PVE, but really dump them in boss fights.
---
That's the saddest part, the accepting of this kind of assery as an inevitability. I'm there, too.
---
The only small reassurance is that eventually this kind of thing will come crashing down around their ears. There is only so much time and money people can collectively spend on microtransaction-filled live service games and the more of them that come out, the more the industry steps on its own toes and competes with itself. We're hitting oversaturation levels.
---
All we can do as a fanbase of a particular game series or company is try to dissuade them from it before the proverbial shit hits the fan and everything burns. Send a clear message to the parent company/higher-ups making the decisions that this kind of thing won't fly here and hope enough people join us in doing so that it'll get the point across.
---
Lost the world but I’ll find him again and let you know
---
If I gave all my good stuff away, you would need 9 characters to carry it.
---
At over 1000 hours, I'm loving this game, and despite it's many flaws, have no plans on slowing down any time soon.
---
After playing previous FO games in hardcore mode, this one seemed fairly easy for the most part, and like others, you eventually get rewarded with great weapons, Armor, and more caps than you know what to do with.
---
Plant mudfruit + tatos + corn. Those three ingredients craft into vegetable starch, that scraps to adhesive. Every time you've been out for a while and go to camp to clean up, harvest+craft+scrap, and you're getting a bit of adhesive. It adds up.
---
I believe it means that it can be on any random corpse.
---
If you wanna use them that's cool. But FYI you can grow adhesive at your camp, Corn, Mutfruit, Tatos and purified water.

---
First clear?
---
Are people going that low?
---
Take my updoot
---
Super stoked about that one! How did you find the plans for it?
---
Because it was known that this four skins would be themed on specific Power Armors.
---
If you trust any company on this earth, big or small, you have only yourself to blame. I barely trust random single people, let alone a company of hundreds.
---
No worries my dude irl takes precedence over all.
---
Once all this repair kit nonsense quiets down there should be more in Edgars ongoing journey.
---
Read it at your leisure.
---
They are used in mods also.
---
I’m having a different issue now, though. I cannot install the X-01 targeting HUD. Weird.
---
Are you still online? I've been hopping ages
---
Words of truth...
---
Well I don't have 9 toons, but it's true, you get what you grind!
---
Where does it say this in the atom store?
---
They changed it, that is WHY people are mad
---
lol its in the patch notes.... People, READ THE PATCH NOTES.
---
God forbid that they made zero clarification that it wouldn't actually apply the skin, but actually change the model of any power armor set you apply it to (other than X-01).
---
I was under the impression it was going to work on camp objects based on previous info, but to be honest, even that takes so little effort I don't know why anyone would care.
---
If you only want to do the challenges you can use the camera to take photos of the challenge subjects. It then gives you the photos full warning and doesn't save the image you just took but the subjects within the photo are counted for the challenge.
---
Since i'm an idiot, i may have been mistaken, my uniform isn't called Forrest, it's "Asylum Worker Uniform Green" which i don't think it's the same one, is it?
---
Wow, a rational human being. I thought they were extinct on this sub
---
may 9 iirc
---
Thanks but nvm I just found a thread saying it’s on a corpse leaning up against a car at the water park
---
Find my example, it wasn't hypothetical.  It was one that actually happened, where my team had to retreat because of broken gear.  You have to scroll down a ways though...
---
I won't be taking any photos then, I'm maxed out at 50 also.
---
yeah, it is, if you can get him to trigger the prison event, i need my pump action shotgun plan, lol
---
Popcorn is best cooked over an open flame, but sure, I'll bring the chocolate. The good stuff too, not the walmart brand :)
---
It's not really winning anything but it's that with time they will nerf perks so that you will consider buying kits. Remember when they nerfed White Knight perk? Because "It was overperforming" ? And everybody was asking why would they nerf that perk? Now we get our answer. This is just the beginning.
---
At Level 38, it's a tricky proposition. I believe you get an easier set of robots (Lt. Gutsy instead of Col. Gutsy, normal Assaultrons versus Assaultrons Dominators).  Bringing a higher-level player can tip that balance against you, as you'll face the harder variants. So, if you need help, seek someone of a similar level.
---
No problem! Have fun out there
---
&gt; Improved Repair Kits are not available in the Atomic Shop. They are rare items you can earn by completing in-game content.
---
&gt; They are currently dropped as loot by the Scorchbeast Queen and may be added as rewards for other types of in-game content in the future.
---
Ahh, so they are meant to be SO rare, that realisticaly, only the ones from the Atom Shop are viable for use.  
---
#*NICE*
---
Did you not even bother to read it? They cannot be hotkeyed.
---
I’d pay for the DLCs if they would actually finish an idea. They all feel like they have been a quick idea to get people to do something for a short period. I think they feel that they are struggling to keep up with the players that are getting bored. My response to those players, maybe you should get off YouTube and stop reading dataminers posts. If you want to rush to get to the end game content, you’re obviously going to miss the things that you could learn to do along the way.
---
Regardless, Bethesda needs to complete ideas and stop being so ADHD about it. Almost everything that they have been dinged for was foreseeable. You can’t please everyone but you could try to listen to both concerns and ideas from both sides. Vs pulling a blizzard or activision and make the game basically play itself. I’d love more mystery in the game. Where it’s randomizes so dataminers can’t pinpoint locations. I’d love Bethesda to also put misleading items in their dev room, so it questions the reliability of the dataminers.
---
No, the Chassis itself prevents using them
---
Ahhh friggg the update
---
BTW, here's the post I made on reddit a while back:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b90e2s/build\_the\_mad\_bomber\_how\_i\_learned\_to\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b90e2s/build_the_mad_bomber_how_i_learned_to_stop/)
---
What a sad world we live in.
---
When are we going to get a fix for the mire daily quests? I haven’t been able to do idle explosives or play time in over a month. I’d like more chances at the very low chance of getting the rare apparel :(
---
I'm on my way!
---
They’re bad at the beginning but once you have a steady supply of resources in later levels it’s nbd
---
I literally did this last night, probably do the same for the hatchet and laser rifle
---
All hail the great glowing divine! For the mothman!
---
Wow, that’s a good one.  
---
I have to imagine that would get pretty pricy tho
---
They're in the files, so my guess is whenever the real deal comes out
---
Ill just stay 5 more min on this server and then ill join my friends, ill post if there is a corpse
---
The world is a better place then it has been in the entirety of human history, you're just mad about video games, a luxury item of such astoundingly complex nature 99% of human history would never even be able to conceive of it. Corporations care about money, people care about themselves and their loved ones. That's not sad, that's reality
---
I had to ask my buddy the same thing!
---
Took me 130+ levels to get mine and I finally got them both a couple hrs. apart.  I have managed to find one more (which I bought).  I am on XBOX if you want to trade for it
---
Look at the picture he has a red arrow pointing to the said location.
---
No, it's not. And I already have the green one :/
---
Your VP's word is garbage, and as long as pay to win mechanics are in this game, I won't be buying any atoms, for any reason.  This is fucking insanity, guys.
---
Just meant our hard drive space, we have these super powerful machines and can save less pictures than a flip phone.
---
Thought so, my bad man :(
---
One of the bugs I’ve had is when I try to exit a workbench I get stuck and am unable to get free.
---
It’s happened more than 5 times now and each time you have to restart the game
---
Camera was just released today!
---
Some Daily quest. I have a spare one. U can have it for free, but I already left server.
---
No problem, I really do appreciate the offer though!
---
Killed three queens in a row. Dropped me 6 Improved Repair Kits.
---
Hope you grabbed it, deleted my other comment as I left the server.
---
Tbh considering we still had camera based challenges a week before the camera released I wouldn't get my hopes up- but it'd be super cool if that's the case.
---
The four door in the middle of the car park. The tourist is leaning against the car.
---
&gt; sorting DOES work.
---
Yes. Just like the car that was only designed to go backward DOES work. But like the sort function, it certainly doesn't work in any way that is helpful, or that people would consider functionally complete. Any reasonable person will look at it and say "That's broken". You can be as pedantic as you want about this, but that won't make it any less broken.
---
The only thing that is not effected is the camera (based on other comments I had read) and alcohol from the brewing station.
---
+Karma for you. Thanks for doing this!
---
With weapon artisan 3 and gunsmith 5 I rarely have to repair my explosive shotgun or auto rifles.  When I do it doesn’t cost much in terms of mats.
---
I'd be more excited about the camera if I could save more than 50 pictures.
---
For some reason, this challenge is counting the amount of times I press to collect the wood, not the amount of wood itself. I recommend starting at vault 76, walking to isolated cabin, then the limber mill ending with wixon homestead, collecting all wood at each location. Then fast travel to W.V lunber co, and top off the route with Watoga, walk across the border of watoga (straight ahead and right from station fast travel point.) there are a bunch of logs there
---
Smh
---
Lies r still lies no matter how pretty the package.
---
Pffft. So, repair kits are worse than guns and armor? Worse than massive stat boosts in PvP? Worse than increased move speed? I've seen all three, and in games that were far more PVP based than 76. So shush.
---
Need steel or/and aluminum, rubber, oil and maybe new less common resource "chain." Riding on road (equip like power armor) allows movement at run speed without ap loss, "sprinting" increases speed and reduces control. Riding off road or doing a "sweet jump" reduces durability. Once broken repair at tinkers workbench. If game engine supports it, uphill reduces ap like being over encumbered.
---
Allows fast travel when over encumber by &lt;100 lbs (you try riding a bike with a HUGE back pack!)
---
Able to attack from bike at baseline accuracy penalty, perks/mutations can increase/reduce penalty. 
---
Thoughts?
---
so many people wait for the blackbird, and they buy atoms to get it
---
Nice to see a positive post. You did spell their name wrong though lol
---
Ps4? xb1 or pc?
---
2 edgy 4 me
---
Ps4
---
Did the quest pop up after u found the guy with the camera? And is this the only location to find him?
---
Have my vote, I'll never use em and don't mind them being in game. Still don't get how they are pay to win...
---
I'm also maxed out I mean cmon Bethesda what the heck. I really starting not to trust your ways of thinking things through
---
Where by at Wavy?
---
Whats your psn? Cant find tourist anywhere
---
I got that poster plan and a new lens
---
I’ll try that thanks.
---
Right. Also possibly incorporate some of the wild wasteland mechanics from FO4, like the beta wave emitter to have a tame death claw (I haven’t played fo4 in a minute.. sorry if I used the wrong term). Brahmin would be a good place to start considering they’ve been used as pack animals for traders.
---
What that they said it would be cosmetics only and nothing that effects gameplay? Pete Hines did in the interviews he gave out around E3.
---
Bethesda's on my list of publishers who I will only buy titles for on steep discounts now. It's not just "I won't buy atoms"  I am \_never\_ buying a full price bethesda game at any point in the future as long as they're going to lie to us about the content of those games.
---
Yes but we’d still have these same challenges today. Unless they delayed the Sheepsquatch release?
---
what did you do today for such a bad karma ? ;)
---
(i still didnt find a single deluxe prosnap  but plenty of the useless other ones...)
---
I found one at the Colonol Kelly Monument.
---
I found mine at the Tyler court fair grounds , in the little stairs like audience looking at the ride, he was sitting in a chair
---
They should be craftable, mix some common materials with a flux and away you go.
---
Yeah
---
It's not a competitive advantage and it is barely a convenience, but from now on any adjustment to condition degradation or how much junk you get, or how much junk you use to repair or build is suspect.
---
I keep posting this but the repair kits turn these into accounting questions instead of just game balance questions.  That is the issue here.  Now they can't adjust junk without people rightly wondering if the shop wasn't hitting projected revenue that month.
---
Oh I would appreciate that!
---
In the car park slump against a car in front of the entrance.
---

---
I am not on that server anymore, found him at wavy willards in the front parking lot but apparently its random so may have to server hop
---
the golden revolver skin game back thou
---
*Obligatory "great graphics but terrible grindy gameplay" reply.*
---
It's not a MMO, if it was a MMO.
---
It would need more content then, the developers are currently producing.
---
Also bulking does not count as crafting so it wont double that either
---
I understand how business works just fine. If someone who runs a business lies to me, they stop _getting my business_.
---
We did sheepsquatch and one of the pylons would not let us activate it. We had 6 people trying to activate it and it would make the sound like we activated but we couldn’t. And the event failed.
---
for me, repair kits are really just a big box of screws. Because I am forever out of screws to repair anything. Luck of the draw handles it 99% of the time, but that 1% :cannot repair. you have only 2 of the required 3921 screws to repair.
---
Ive hopped like 20 servers. Smh ok ty
---
Offered to pay the person who was holding it 1k caps...
---
How so? These can be put on their hotkeys, so they can literally run a build that doesn't use gunsmith 5 or any of the other perks that are designed to slow item degradation. Thus allowing them to run more DPS or tank perks. That is an advantage.
---
They described the Atom shop in two ways, "no Pay to Win" and "cosmetic only." The repair kits are not cosmetic, so people are immediately flipping their collective shit, never mind how meaningless the repair kits are, because Bethesda (the creators of Canvasgate and PvPgate) lied to them.
---
No problem at all! Figure I save people the hassle of server jumping and spending caps fast traveling. I just get to sit on a bench and eat my salad so it's pretty easy!
---
Item shop was never announced as cosmetic only.
---
What does it mean that I will get double the results from crafting? Does it mean the amount of things produced or their stats?
---
Haha. Don't get how repair kits are pay2win... I think it's just lazy. It's a survival game, checking your gear should be a priority. Go fix it, it's easy.
---
I think, if they bundled every single bit of new content together since launch together in a single DLC pack, I'd maybe buy it for a fiver.
---
Don’t suppose you’ve still got him?
---
Upvote just for the meta awareness. You go, you!
---
Is that also where you get the camera?
---
I think quest items are not affect too, as well as the bulks packages
---
I'm not talking about just reddit, look at the official forums or any of the other areas on the internet talking about fo76.
---
Which car does it spawn by?
---
Just baught ot and it has a badass noise when you hit the ground from a fall its does like this cool rad noise
---
Yep, it would totally be fine then
---
Only thing i can imagine is if people take off makeshift warrior etc in favor of other perks and just spam repair kits, but that seems like a waste of money.
---
Hey mind if I join you real quick??
---
bah ha ha, you got my laugh, here's an upvote to go with it.
---
If it's any consolation, the same thing happens on PC.
---
TimeFree26er PS4
---
It’s a semi random spawn on each server, meaning it’s in a few fixed locations but random on which location that’ll be. Found mine on a teapot, decided to wave to my teammate (while not in PA) with the camera in my players hand then I ended up in Charleston.
---
Since launch? Totally agree with ya there. Hopefully the Wastelander update is as expansive as they’ve made it out to be.
---
Sure, just come to me. Will be online for at least an hour.
---
And I would have bought atoms if they hadn't decided to start having the type of items that encourage them to make the game less fun in order to push you to buy atoms to make it more fun. I'm not going to spend money to encourage them to make the game worse.
---
It will. At some point it will. When I started gaming, games cost $40-$50, came functionally complete, and did not try to nickle and dime you afterwards without making a full on lengthy expansion pack of content. And now here we are, paying $80 for deluxe editions of games with minimal extra content, broken as fuck and completely hollow gameplay wise, but includes a fully functioning cash shop that sees more content updates than the game itself does. So, let me ask you again. Why? Why are you brushing honest complaints aside? There are a lot of people here that don't like what Bethesda is doing, actual majority or not, but you act viciously because you say it doesn't directly affect you.  So why do that?  I don't need you to respond to me; respond to yourself.
---
Stood right next to him
---
Me too, but i will overspam them!!
---
We understand your frustration and we passed on the information. While we look into the tons of bugs, how about you check out the new emote and skins in our Atom Store?
---
I don't see Pete Hines jumping on twitter to throw those people under the bus either.
---
I was able to complete the quest with no problem yesterday, did the bug affect everyone or just some people?
---
Unless they nerf the effectiveness of Lucky Break or Luck of the Draw in hopes of increased sales of repair kits, then I don’t really care. I don’t need repair kits, repair kits aren’t essential to continue the story, and there’s no real value in them apart from saving on materials, which are abundant in the world. If they start selling story essential items in the shop, then we can grab our pitchforks.
---
Literally only 1 thing you listed has even come out, the other two could end up exactly like the burrows. Also, I really don't think the brewing stuff counts as it is something that was already in the game, they just added it in later.
---
Shotguns break easily?  Really?  
---
My primary weapon is an explosive double barrel shotgun.  I play 2-4 hours per day, and probably pop off 400-500 shells per day. I do run gunsmith 5 perk all the time. 
---
If I repair that gun (with artisan 3 card) more than 3 times a week I’d be surprised.
---
Where exactly is it?
---
You could be in pvp and your weapon or armor breaks and instead of having to flee the workshop or area you could probably get away with hiding for a moment to quickly repair the items with the kits, however if you are in survival or own a workshop you should take it upon yourself to keep all your gear topped up anyway.
---
Though armor can break really fast depending on the weapon your opponent uses and given the nerf of white knight that only further gives fuel to be mad at repair kits.
---
As McSaltMaker said though all the god tier gear people run around with on pvp that was duped and bought has permanently damaged pvp and is far worse then a repair kit although not bought from beth directly. It's rough for the people who get ganked by these people in groups and even if you know all the counters it takes too long to kill a group of em before they get ya.
---
I get both sides saying its not a big deal cause you can repair your own gear to 200% etc. but the point I mentioned above and for new game players it is by definition pay to win, but only really so if you are talking about pvp.
---
Have you seen apple? They have the tools to make whatever technology they want, but they insist on creating problems and selling solutions.
---
It’s no different here.
---
The repair kit for sale in the ATOM SHOP only repairs to 100%
---
Did you get it to work? Seems to work without crouching but doesn’t shoot you upwards only left
---
Classic politician move.   Acknowledge their previous statements, show they've 'heard' the complaints of the player base, and make some minor conciliatory statement about how they might address it.  
---
But still not backing up on their decision, still pushing forward with the drive for profits over promises made.  
---
It's a trend, and has been an issue since release.    Advertise a package with specifics, swap out those elements for cheaper ones.   Advertise and sell a 'collectors item' of a bottled drink, swap it out with a crappy and cheap sleeve over a cheap bottle.   And now, break the previous promises of 'only cosmetic', a promise stated numerous times, reaffirmed multiple times, and now blatantly broken.  
---
What is important here is the trend that shows the intent, and how things will continue to progress.  
---
As long as people take an indifferent view on the situation, make statements like "it doesn't affect me", "it doesn't matter", etc., then the company is being rewarded for their bad behavior and will continue to do so.  
---
This will only change if people take a strong stance, voice their complaint and refuse to accept this behavior.  And enforce it by boycotting the company.      
---
Vote with your wallet, and walk away.
---
Yea my texture mods dont work in misc, but they break the game in archive2list. But they arent that big of a deal to me, so its okay I guess.
---
I guess ignorance is a bliss for you.
---
I will WRITE if I want to. I don't see anyone laughing at me or the truth provided by me. If you don't agree, that is your opinion, even if it differs from the mass. Live and talk in your own small made-up world, you can call yourself a human NPC, if you want.
---
Don't blame me your post got lost, because it's stupid to speculate something that most likely will not be added.
---
Still no statement why human NPC's are needed, so they will not be added as not needed. Period.
---
Also I have a good one - getting the last word means that you win the debate - small tip for you to become a winner.
---
I think no one is really excited about the fact that it’s an npc that’s not a robot. The only other one is Grahm, which is a step in the right direction.
---
Can anyone access game files? It’s make this easier
---
Who knows, they claimed it would be. But they also claimed there would only be cosmetics on the ATOM shop too.
---
The normalization of non-cosmetic items and the implications of what can come after that is what many people disagree with and are vehemently against. I don't care how little of a potential advantage it may or may not bring. It's a slippery slope that rarely will end well.
---
I've never traded or bought gear from others, I just use what I find, I've had several tse drops , they are not my best weapons, I've sold many to vendors in game( robot vendors) . But this Reddit will strictly believe anyone at all with a two shot explosive is a cheater , that bought it. It become comical.
---
Haha,of course. No, it's disczak
---
is he still with you?
---
It was known.
---
so, the monkey’s paw?
---
I’ll track that down.
---
Found it at the Tyler county fairgrounds also
---
No, he's dead.
---
I love your username
---
Imagine if we had to make ammo for all the turrets...lol
---
I think it was a red car.
---
Yeah I get that but they bought the game aware of that change and that this would be a possibility.
---
People who are recreationally angry don't read things fully, it interferes with their hobby.
---
I think OP means real-life Sheepsquach plushies.  The in-game one is already available in the Atomic Shop.
---
It's very restricted as it shoots you to a set distance and you need to be high as the vertical jump is not much.
---
Ahhh that would be why
---
I’ll join you in a sec if that’s okay.
---
Happens to me everytime I load in on pc, I have fios
---
Lovely...oh well would just take up more stash space anyway
---
Its well worth it! I figure people always get a kick outta seeing it :)
---
As a PR guy, that'd be about the stupidest possible thing he could do. Much as I'd love to see it happen.
---
Pc?
---
As soon as they ship out the canvas bags.
---
without details, it's hard to say but:
---
more than 6 in INTELLIGENCE is useless, it's always situational, (and mostly craft) and you can have all situations with 6
---
less than 5 in LUCK takes you away from Mutations (and mutations are really powerful)
---
I never found an use for ENDURANCE at all: you can stick it to 1
---
Just stitch "xX420Luvr69Xx wuz here" on the walls with your SMG.
---
"Give us more stuff like the stuff you've been giving us recently... yeah. That totally works as a 'gotcha'. Makes total sense."
---
It's amazing how long a gatling gun lasts with max gunsmith. Mine was near breaking during last SQB fight I had 300 rounds left near the end and was wondering if I'd run out of ammo first or have  the gun break. It actually lasted till the end after 1000ish rounds total. I also just picked up an AA auto grenade and it's amazing.
---
Holy sea biscuits ima dresses up as a superhero up up and away
---
My statement: uninstalled the game. Playing other games.
---
They have numbers that track user counts. Hit them at those numbers. If you decline to buy this one thing, they'll assume it's because you're saving up to buy some other thing, and then the problem gets worse. You want this changed? It's not about refusing to buy that one product - it's about not walking into that shop anymore. Let Bethesda see their empty servers and understand what they've done.
---
Why didn't you save him?!
---
I'd buy that too.. been wishing for one since the beginning
---
Which hand do you use?
---
I can imagine that too, but I think you just answered as to why they wouldn't.  I don't think you can assign these to your wheel anyway since you have to use them through your pipboy  menu. That was the point of my post is to let the experience of using them be the judge if they are worth it or not
---
I have probably spent way more on Atoms than the average player and I am pissed at this decision. It isn't about funding the game, it is about what the money is being spent on
---
Did you just ignore the quote directly from Pete Hines this thread is named after?!?
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bggxol/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_85_notes_april/ell1dr1/) is how I replied in another comment chain where you said the same thing. Let's pick a comment chain and add replies to that so we're not double posting
---
They lowered it to be consistent with other similar perks.

The problem people have isnt with regular repair kits, its with the Atom shop ones specifically.  and not because of he repair kits themselves, but what they represent.   Bethesda claimed, in no uncertain terms, that the Atom shop would always be 100% cosmetic only, and now they have lied.  people are complaining about the "slippery slope" because thats exactly what this is.  
---
no, people who are playing the game right have no reason to buy them ever, YET.  theres no reason to think that Bethesda wont do things like Up the amount of materials needed to repair power armor, or decrease the availability of rarer items.  even today, people arent going to be using repair kits to fix their shotguns, they will be used to save the shit load of Black titanium it takes to fix the Excavator power armor.   
---
and based on the patch notes, it looks like Bethesda plans on making the "free" repair kits SO rare, that only the paid Atom shop ones become viable.   then all they have to do is make "balance" changes causing power armor to degrade faster, and require more materials to repair, and increase the scarcity of said materials, and BOOM, now the player has to choose between spending a large amount of time and weight management to keep their PA in working order, or pay the "very reasonable" amount of atoms "that you can totally get for free by playing the game".   all of a sudden it stops being a purchase for convenience, and becomes a purchase to *avoid inconvenience*.
---
Okay bois i found a new server just add me, join me and go to the miners monument
---
It’s just east of the Sons of Dane campground, where the night stalker event is.
---
lol thats fine but don't complain about the players that have never broken terms but trade on reddit those people aren't just handing that stuff out for nothing takes a lot of hours to obtain gear like that you cant just say anyone who has a set of sentinel is a cheater or bought it for cash. like i said totally cool if you wanna limit yourself and play like that kudos to you but other people dont. You do the exact same as them and be on the exact same level without ever breaking the rules of the game.
---
Games whose developers promised, "We will not do X" who then go ahead and do X anyway - they probably dont deserve to exist years from now.
---
Both.
---
If you happen upon a forrest and yellow uniforms let me know haha
---
Eww, I use toilet paper.
---
I mean 'The mods  for the legs ' 🤣🤣
---
100% will, i know my first character from the beta has a bunch of hats if you need any, not sure what ones but i could check
---
I wanted his loot.
---
Wurds r hardd.
---
It's more like buying Mr. Pipp instead of Dr. Pepper in order to stick it to Walmart for their prices.
---
Walmart doesn't care because you still walked in the front door. You want Bethesda to full stop this? You have to stop logging into the game. Period.
---
Yes it just popped up. This is the only place I found him
---
hmm. bird bones and goat legs. the high launch could be useful for getting to strange places, and survivable.
---
Wuss.
---
Player "hotel" doors. Like keycode but behind a caps payment.
---
As of today it is too late unless the retract to go down this road. Bethesda was like yes, we will go down the bumpiest and worst road we can on this, forget the sunshine the other way we want pot holes and a toxic waste dump of a fanbase.
---
This. It will help lessen the Fast Travel simulator for some which will include me. A motorcycle would be cool.
---
I have a very high end intel machine still takes about 30 to 60 seconds for some reason.
---
Anyone still have him in on psn
---
I'm pretty sure Stormy Daniels has that one done.
---
Are you sure? I feel like that worked at one point, I swear I bulked a bunch of stuff and triggered the perk.
---
Atomic shop version is the "clean" version.
---
Haha. Good post after all the shit ones since the patch. High-five.
---
I have no mic ingame atm, but thank you sir, doing the lords work.
---
A "PSA"? LOL...just an opinion really, you are not doing the public a service. As I do agree with not NEEDING a repair kit, it's still a nice option to have if you don't feel like running to a bench to repair and sitting through multiple Loading Screens to do so. It's a time saver and you really can't complain much seeing the price of them...6 repair kits for 250 Atoms, I can make 1,000 Atoms a session if I wanted to, but I receive enough just playing and not grinding for them.
---
As far as telling people "You are doing the game wrong" by using a repair kit, is just BS. People will play how they feel like playing &amp; if saving a few minutes avoiding loading screens is wrong, you sir ...must have all the time in the world. Some people don't.
---
Ah, thank you. I honestly could not tell the difference.
---
Clean in the atom shop, vs dirty version in game.
---
Thanks :)
---
One is spanky new and clean.
---
Nice try, Bethesda but I don't care if it is convenience or advantage they give you. What I don't like is they give you, the developer, incentive to make the game worse so I feel I need that convenience to not be annoyed by the game. And don't say you won't do that. You've already followed the playbook of ea and rockstar and all those chasing the f2p and games as service money so I don't believe for one second we won't see you slowly rebalance the game or introduce new stuff that really makes it hard to play without these kits. And your word means nothing when you already went back on cosmetic only and gave some bullshit excuse. 
---
Let me just say if there are microtransactions in your future games I will not touch them. And you lost some one who was willing to pre order your games cause I'll wait to see if you have them in the games first. And I won't make the mistake of trusting you at your word that they will be cosmetics only next time. I would not have bought this game if I knew it had pay for the convenience microtransactions. You won't be seeing a dime more from me on this game unless you want to go back to your original promise and remove these from the store.
---
Pc
---
All good, I got all the hats :) just need the yellow and forrest uniforms to complete
---
You get double the amount.
---
Produced. If you make 1 stimpak then there will be a chance to get 2
---
If you look at them side by side, you'd notice but otherwise not major necessity for anyone other than professional wasteland rodeo clowns.
---
The in-game one is worn out, dirty, and ragged.
---
The Atom Shop version is Clean and Pristine. You also receive the plans so you can make it whenever you want (But it's not tradable).
---
That's generally how items that can be found both in-game and in the Atom Shop are.
---
The uproar is the canary in the coal mine. Once it's dead, you can't say "well maybe it was just sick or old" - you have to assume that bad deadly gas is on the way and shut down the mine.
---
Bethesda went back on it's promise and is now selling a game that has an impact on in-game performance. The canary is dead.
---
I'll keep an eye out man
---
Zoom isn't wanting to work on mine, everything else is so meh just a small thing
---
Haha.
---
Appreciate it 👍🏻
---
Thank you!!
---
The one in-game is the "filthy peasant" version.
---
Welcome to EA's new Bethesda, Enough said. If you support P2W good on you man, honestly. Not a viewpoint shared by everyone, not shared by me particulary either but it doesn't matter either way, Money talks, That's now the sole remaining mindset in the entire industry, Anyone who's disgusted by it might aswell go back 20 years and play the games from that era, atleast there they had a lick of decency.
---
Cheers bud.
---
shh Im trying to be mysterious ;)
---
You're welcome. now we're even
---
I did not complain about anything , just made a statement. My statement to be more clear is that I don't think it's cheating to trade , I am socially awkward as f*** lol. So I don't. But it's totally cool for others to do as they please . My point is this Reddit calls anyone with good gear a cheater, I find that to be an unfair assertion.
---
Any idea on when the Grognak Axe will be fixed?
---
I hope they will add some restrictions for using them, perhaps you can’t use them within a range of an enemy player? That would fix everyone’s problems with it.
---
Are you sure it doesn't functionally refer to the Sheepsquach Imposter and is just poorly worded?
---
This also happened to me. Read somewhere on this subreddit that it can occur because you try to move before the exit workbench animation has completed.
---
Why have challenges and quests where the point is to kill monster while wearing a costume/hat. What about people in PA that do not have survivability outside of that suit. They can't do these and yes I know you can take helmet off, that is not the point.
---
Almost all videos from BGS about end game has been with people wearing PA's, so to them PA is big part of that. Then they make a perk system that limits you and is very slow to change from build to build. After that they give us challenges to not use PA and still kill top level monsters.
---
I like that it’s under armor. Stick odd armor over the top, look ace.
---
You are awesome, thank you so much!
---
i wont move for a long time friend, add me and come get your camera
---
Oh i must have mis read.
---
Wow, ok, didn't like everyone say that they didn't want repair kits in the Atomic Shop? So thanks for listening
---
I found mine on the top of the Landview Lighthouse held by a dead tourist named Anne
---
Which ride was the stand looking at?
---
If you think "gold rounds" are not something Bethesda is talking about right now, then you are naive.
---
Is it one person per pylon now and no more soloing all 3 pylons?
---
&gt;I never found an use for ENDURANCE at all: you can stick it to 1
---
Fireproof is the only perk in that tree that justifies more points, and that's only really needed if you're running an explosive weapon and/or fight scorchbeasts on the regular.
---
I did and this is what I found:

**NEWS** | FALLOUT 76    NOVEMBER 2, 2018  BY BETHESDA GAME STUDIOS  "Welcome to the Atomic Shop"
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop) 
---
No where in this link does it say that the Atomic Shop was for cosmetic only.  It states that you can acquire other items like weapon skins, armor skins, emotes, decor and more.    (I will repeat myself, it say's "**and more."**)   
---
So that would mean "weapons kits" would be part of the **and more**.  
---
It also states: **The Atomic Shop was founded to give you as much choice and variety in how you want to customize and celebrate your adventures. It doesn't offer anything with a competitive advantage, and more so, it aims to bring joy not just to you, but to the other dwellers around you.**  
---
I"m sorry that the F.A.Q. (where you got your information) states otherwise, but considering this link is far more in depth than the F.A.Q. I tend to believe it more.
---
Bought mine for 8-9k. Thats chump change.
---
Same thing happened to me, but I couldn't find the imposter version anywhere when crafting.
---
I would love this!
---
Games were no where near as big and detailed back then either. The size of some of these games is unbelievable. $60 is a pretty low price for hundreds of hours worth of entertainment.
---
Queued up to join, you're a popular guy!  Once I get in, where is the tourist located?
---
It's the matter of precedent, and how this is going to lead to damage, resist and XP buffs.  Guaranteed.
---
You're a game developer who is fucking shit at your job? As a guess.
---
Use this to mock up the build you have in mind and edit your post so we can help tweak it.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
So it doesn't say in the atom store? You do realize most players don't use reddit right?
---
I got a refund, thank you!
---
BINGO, honestly I'm loving seeing him eat crow all over here. His whiny ass last month was arguing against anyone trying to call this out and calling out the health boost the outfits on the atom shop was p2w lite and just getting people used to it and more would come later.
---
He kept trying to claim, "slippery slope", yet here we are today with exactly what I said would happen happening.
---
One is PTW and the other isn't.  /s
---
Hopefully you get some information as I don't understand stacking yet and how crits work etc. All I know is even without a crit, my applied perks and physcho make my BE Lever a death machine lol.
---
So I'd ask you if repairing even needs to be a game mechanic then?
---
The atomic shop was never announced as cosmetic only. That's my point. Go check out the official post. I dont care about a Pete Hines out of context quote. The official announcement is what I'm basing my argument on. Everyone's feelings toward this are valid, they just arent starting from a factual point. Context and reasoning are very important in making and maintaining a sound arguement.
---
Point is over near shortstop. Third base area.  
---
You.... way over in left field, bud.  
---
It's about the ridiculous of strategy forced on people. Not the ability to do well with said strategy.  
---
You've also completely misunderstood the 12 people thing.  
---
But hey, you've been slow on the uptake on every interaction I've ever had with you. I don't expect you to be clever enough to get this one. Poor guy. :/
---
Well, shit, now you have me feeling guilty for posting such a caustic complaint.   You do so much for me. You already put a glow in the dark map there, but the repair kits?  I have done nothing to deserve such privilege.
---
Sent, you rule!
---
Cool. I’m not sure how much I paid for both, but it wasn’t too much. Wanna say 350 for both?
---
Cool
---
Eventually, you have to take a break away from killing other players to go farm up the materials needed for repairs. This forces a 'cool down', even a small one, in your non-stop player murder sprees.
---
Repair kits mean that if you have the money and can afford to spend it on an online game, you no longer have that cool down. You can just go bananas.
---
Even if they didn't nerf White Knight, everyone thinks that it's because of the repair kits.  Repair kits now make any  junk and condition related balancing suspicious.  
---
Even if there are legit balance reasons to make a class of gun require more repairs, having repair kits taints it because we will never know if it was to balance or increase revenue.
---
Requisite ‘load the perk card’ response.
---
&gt;	That revenue can easily come from cosmetics only like they told us.
---
Easily? That’s pure guesswork without looking at their financials. Hell, if the revenue from the cosmetics had been fantastic, I doubt they would have taken this step at all.
---
Just messaged you
---
Confirmed found at Phillipi cemetery laying down on the path between the graves
---
Yeah sadly there are a few people still in the server, I ask that most people hop servers so others can join. I am at Colonel Kelly's Monument.
---
Hmm, remember when I tried to tell you that and you said it was a slippery slope and they wouldn't add more p2w stuff to the atom shop?
---
Seems to happen with photo mode poses too.
---
Wow. Chill. Go outside, take a walk. There’s bigger things to worry about.
---
On one hand, if this game is to be supported for 'years', then it is somewhat reasonable to expect the developers to be able to earn a profit so that they can continue supporting the game.
---
On the other, a lot of us have already paid for this game when it was at full price, and we were told the Atom Shop was going to be cosmetic only.  And if Bethesda really wanted to up their Atom profit, they'd go full throttle on making cosmetic items people actually want, since they've been dragging their feet even though it seems pretty clear people want armor, and weapon skins, and interesting camp items.
---
Repair kits don't really fill a niche I personally have a need for.  But all of this is treading the waters.  It starts with something people can just nod off because they don't need it, but then they'll start adding things like ammo conversions, cap packages, or fridges that preserve items on the Atom Shop, and then suddenly it's not something as insignificant as repair kits anymore.
---
Repair kits will lead into something greater that may, or may not be available in standard gameplay it'll really show just the direction Bethesda wants to go, and I dread what it might actually be.
---
Hell no! A cool new under armor!? At last!
---
So somehow I scrapped my camera before finishing quest ..... I can make it again but don’t know where to find Deluxe Broken Prosnap Camera? Any suggestions?
---
Added you. Lessee if I can get in.
---
Thanks in advance, though!
---
Yeah, let's put those drills that we get from 3 star enemies to use!
---
Goodbye Bethesda, Hello EA's Failthesda. That's simply the reality now. Any lasting fragments of decency and care for the Gamers is officially gone now. Welcome to the "New ERA of games. Insert your credit card here to install the launcher, now 3 hours faster for 20 bucks!".
---
Cool idea but I don’t t want to give people any more reason to grief a base lol
---
It's written in the description. It even says it is in the category of "casual" which means it will recieve those s.p e.c.i.a.l. bonuses.
---
I was hoping to see "the Action Hero" legendary 50 call machine gun quest or is that already out?
---
Your showing offline
---
Known, it was.
---
Lol. Classic Bethesda.
---
Tip - there's almost always an easy lvl 26 Yao Guai at Phillipi Battlefield Cemetery, just behind the building, in a car park.
---
You're imagining someone with infinite money to throw at these kits for months/years to come, ignoring that even whales will not be able to rely on these 24/7 for their repairs. And advantage over whom? Someone who knows how to play the game without all their shit breaking during a session?
---
Thanks for the invite
---
Repair items have existed since Morrowind and Oblivion. 3 and NV both allowed you to repair stuff straight from your inventory using multiples of the same weapon, which is what I'm frequently referring to.
---
No problem, I also got a refund and got to keep the paint. They told me that skins is different to paint and will change the entire appearance of the armor so I guess this is going to be a new thing new, very lazy of them.
---
Todd: Fuck you, we put these in the atomic shop for lazy shit players.
---
I presume this means you stop playing today?
---
I’m afraid I’m rather more utilitarian: I think a game deserves to exist if enough people are enjoying it to make its existence a viable proposition.
---
Thanks, man!
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
How have they prioritized the Repair Kits when they have still been releasing cosmetics?
---
If you have any weight reducing perks like for aid or junk they dont count in the stash
---
If there is anything you can pull out onto your character instead it helps a lot
---
Why is that multiple other live service games have cosmetic revenue and Bethesda can't?
---
Does anyone know how to craft the lenses or whatever? I got the plans but not sure which bench it might be in!
---
Hope to see you soon!
---
They should be craftable/tradeable
---
The amount of people fussing is fucking ridiculous. I hear you.
---
 I add you my id is mindblast
---
They might want more money in the moment, but they wouldnt do anything that would severely hurt them in the long term, if this becomes completely p2w, most people wont buy the next fallout game, and that in return would ultimately make them lose a lot of money
---
Sadly nothing will change. Mtx bring tons of cash, and as you can see on the atom Store, it takes barely any work. Im Pretty sure Bethesda makes more with this shop then with the Fallout 4 Season pass, and they havent even released content with the size of half a dlc. 
---
People give them Money for things that take just a few hours to make by one or two modelling guys.Its basicly free cash.
---
Im pretty sure if 20 people buy an emote or icon, bethesday is already making profit of it.
---
Yes. This would be great aswell
---
Thanks. I will. It's working for me. 
---
Compared to irl stuff I'm dealing with, this is a cakewalk.
---
heh, most armor is bulky and hides under armor. But at the very least there should be both options...
---
Well if they're going to make the Atom Shop P2W, they need to make the game $10 or less to purchase like Black Desert Online.
---
Here is the bucket list that you get from the npc... Might be a good place to start looking for the camera
---

Spoilers
---
I won't buy any repair kits from the Atom Shop. I may, however, pay to **unlock them** like was announced. Then once I've seen the mechanics at play (instead of partaking in idle speculation beforehand) I will decide then if I want to get out my pitchfork.
---
I haven't logged in since they appeared. I still follow the game, but only to see if this course ever reverses itself.
---
I keep saying I want this emote!!  And don't say we can't because it's a family friendly game...the terminals drop the F bomb among other words.
---
From what I understand it's due to limits imposed by consoles. When a game is installed it reserves a particular amount of storage space. That amount is apparently very difficult or impossible to increase due to restrictions from Microsoft/Sony. This was the explanation I heard when people were asking for similar increases to storage space for FO4 mods but I don't play on console so I'm not super familiar with them.
---
Cant wait to try this
---
Since no one's mentioned it...do one technical data at a time. You loot a technical data, you turn it in. You go back, you loot another technical data, you turn it in. Looting more than one is a waste of time.
---
Oh yes, I know they still stay as screenshots, but I like them appearing as memories in my loading screens :)
---
everybody isn't upset. A very vocal group of people are upset. I couldn't give a fuck one way or the other.
---
That would be awesome- a feature that lets you toggle your armor appearance.
---
No, some of us already know what this is
---
Oh man, I don’t why it does that. I am appearing online
---
Hey Mods... Wake up. 4 hours and no pin. Had to sift through a bunch of posts to find tthis really late
---
Still no legendary pipe revolvers?
---
Really? Did they say in the email that you could keep it?
---
I was being sarcastic thus the /s after my reply. It does allow you to complete a quest without actually finding the item in game. It's about as PTW as repair kits in that regard.
---
Can confirm this.
---
Also, doesn't seem to happen in PA.
---

Still got him? Bioniccommando
---
I see your point but I think the best way to deal with it is to treat the repair kits like a cancer.  Instead of not using the atom shop which would be like cutting off an arm to deal with a single tumor we don't buy the kits and cut out the tumor.  If no one buys them it's a clear message that we don't want them.  If they rebalance the game to make them more of a need then we take more drastic measures.
---
Oh lol
---
Happy to. Considering how tired I was from hopping servers, least I could do was reduce that for others.
---
Unfortunately I expect radio silence on both issues
---
i have now ended up in the void, its dark here. no ways of escaping, fast travel doesnt work either.
---
&gt;KenAD
---
and guess who was right on the money!!!!
---
First try put me into the middle of 4 stingwings (1 legendary 3\* ... don't worry, didnt drop anything good)
---
Second try put me into a loading screen ... for 5 minutes, then I restarted
---
It's for survival mode since you can't fast travel. It was problematic when leveling an alt in survival but I just end up switching back to adventure to travel back and forth and return to survival. :|
---
I'm personally not going to buy any of them. Virtual cash shop consumables is the dumbest thing in the world to spend money on to me. I can't believe how many suckers Korean MMOs have.
---
\+karma
---
Thank you so much
---
Save them elsewhere before you delete them. That’s what I do.
---
When you get the camera please leave so other people can get it
---
&gt;There are other games out there
---
Just picked up the Witcher 3 GOTY. Best storyline and questing I've ever seen.
---
Had to find another tourist and relisten to holotape if anyone else ahs this issue
---
Spent 2 1/2 hours server hopping and nothing
---
Couldn't agree more, but honestly? just uninstall. There's no coming back from this. Bethesda's gone. Replaced by an EA ripoff. The Elder Scrolls and the Fallout Franchise both ended today. Because this sort of bullshit is all that's going to be left within a few months. Pay to Win, zero content and basically unplayable without your Credit card hooked into it 24/7. That's the future of gaming, Thanks to companies like EA, Ubisoft and now, Failthesda.
---
Cool idea, but the engine is really bad at handling this kind of thing. It could only be as fast as a horse, or you would see the constant loading of the enviorement and pop in.
---
Thanks for waiting!
---
made an account literally just to say THANKS!
---
The vault tech was also an under armor and it also saod that.
---
I agree them being on the atomic shop is a mistake, but I dont think you can exactly class it as pay to win. The only advantage you have is a free on the fly repair, but that's not really viable in combat. I'm all for the boycott, just dont think it's really a pay to win item
---
Calling anything "artificial" in a video game is redundant. Of course it is.
---
Saying that the repair system is only designed for microtransactions is absurd. It was revealed as a core part of the game a full year before the launch of repair kits. It's plainly designed to encourage players to gather resources and carefully consider how they use them.
---
If it was "only designed for mtx", there probably wouldn't be a half a dozen different perks that regulate it, which can be combined until repairing is hardly even a consideration.

as funny as this is, i assume this isnt intended, its as simple as equipping a camera and doing an emote, you need to get this forwarded to the dev team for a hotfix ASAP. :)
---
I've got Demo up to 50% extra damage..mainly for my Explosive weapons and grenades...also got the Grenadier rank 1, so all my explosives have an extra 50% blast radius. It's a real fun setup.
---
 At the same time I run a full sneak build with Rifleman perks, with all possible sneak perks in Agility. So all possible weapons that I use, are suppressed(FE Handmade, AA Hunting Rifle, AA Combat Shotty, Exec. Lever Action, AA 10mm pistol, The Fixer), ...which makes my FE handmade insanely fun to use.
---
It’s not a very reliable means of travel or getting to locations it’s very glitchy. Seems to make you travel to your left a fair distance. If you go to far it puts you into a loading screen as if you were fast traveling
---
I really want a way to craft the Blade of Bastet again. I accidentally sold it before logging off one day, and there is NO WAY to get it back again, other than creating a new character and doing the Mistress of Mystery quests again.
---
Please allow us to craft a new Blade of Bastet!!!
---
PC players can store as many as they want because their computers are probably fast enough to load however many images they have in storage when the game starts up. Consoles also don't have the luxury of easily accessible file systems.
---
I see a clear distinction between someone wanting to keep their job and someone deciding to break a promise that was made. However, I do take your point. My point was just that being mad at Pete gets us nowhere.
---
Even if he openly criticized the decision, I feel that's more likely to get him reassigned or removed more than it is to make a difference. It'd help drive the point home, yes, but I won't blame someone for choosing to not get fired.
---
Hw builds take up every slot on the ring for less weight than a gauss, also I bayonet a couple to remove the need for melee weapons.
---
found anne at landview lighthouse
---
....That's basically everywhere.... (Server hopping doesn't seem to be working.... guess gonna have to run across the map.)
---
Guessing it's a random event.
---
You can survive the blast if you're inside the burrows when the bomb hits. People get the notification and immediately travel there so they can get their first.
---
Any new quests?
---
Just to reiterate I don't think that the under armor should be removed but changed that we have the choice to have it as an outfit. It looks great on it's own for stealth based character!
---
 Its a lovely place. Not far from where I live and certainly worth getting to know. 
---
 Sheeech, these city kids. ;)
---
That is hilarious. Maybe this is why they delayed.  But it’s still not working.
---
Why no quest to take a shit in another players camp dressed as a penguin and playing bagpipes?
---
No, I'm not saying they use them for every repair. I'm saying they get them and have some on them at all times so that they don't have to worry about their stuff breaking in the middle of a fight like other have to worry about. That is why most people run gunsmith 5, because they do repair before they go out farming, but there is a chance their stuff will still break mid fight without gunsmith 5.
---
So with these repair kits, whales can keep say 5 on them at all times so that if they do break something mid fight, they can fix it real quick then go back to their camp to repair to 200.
---
You clearly have put very little thought into everything and then started making a bunch of illogical assumptions, go look at the whole scenario and not just from your perspective okay? Maybe then you can come up with something good to say that will change peoples minds
---
Not at all.  I've done all my launches solo but did not attempt my first until level 60 something.  Spent a ton of time getting lost in the silo and not understanding what the next step was.  Enemies respawn at regular intervals during certain portions so I burned though a lot of consumables.  Good luck!

I meant it's Bethesda, not Bath...

Your stash isn’t full 800/800 is it?

I wonder how far one can fly from the top of the mansions in the ash heap or the top of the world.
---
Yup. The data had showed different and I personally think this is a stupid move. At least if you had to get mats and craft them yourself people wouldnt have as much of a problem with it
---
You can repair a weapon on the fly.. might not be the difference between winning and losing but the fact that it provides some sort of advantage I would think is indisputable.
---
Yeah doesn’t seem to work in power armor unfortunately but it seem to always take you left of where your facing a good ways away
---
PC, IGN MrBright01, at the waterpark.
---
It isn't out of context, read the interview, it was a pointed question about if the ATOM shop would have P2W items in it. He clearly stated that it would only have cosmetics and nothing that would effect gameplay.
---
Doesn't change the fact that they lied about cosmetic only
---
Where was the body? I have hopped 6 times at Miner Monument and I just wanna make sure Im looking where I need to...

Interesting. Upvoting for a neat discovery.

You know, I dislike some of those posts. You know what i dislike more? Completely off topic shitposts like this.
---
Why the fuck would anyone do that or even want to do that? Who's gonna pay $5 bucks a week to not have some perk cards and not have to get junk? Junk you'd still need to get for the thousands of other uses it has.
---
Sir William Joel finds this post amusing.
---
There were about five skins for it in FO4, I wonder if theyll release all of them eventually in the shop?
---
To think this is only the first one, there's 3 more if I'm correct which will most likely be the same way.
---
Change your message to 'Cult of Bethesda' more accurate.

 Junk. I have about 35lbs of non Junk and begrudge every pound. ;)

I actually REALLY like this, it means you could have an X-01 with the stats of T-51 or Ultracite
---
Ok I'm back
---
There was no one on the map in that location. Just as the launch prep was initiating another nuke was launched on the SBQ. Literally no one was there I'm not mistaken my friend watched the map we were first.
---
I’m a HW build and shredder miniguns removed my need for melee weapons long ago. I love it
---
Don't hold your breath waiting for an answer.
---
Guess what? People with Atoms they got from doing regular questing can have some on hand too. So that point is moot.
---
So both of you have to have your weapons break at the same time? When has that ever happened?
---
Definitely not intended. We'll investigate, thank you!
---
I understand it being a disappointment for some, but I don’t think it’s lazy. It’s intentional since each horseman is supposed to be unique so it would make sense for each one to have a certain PA.
---
Thanks for the report, we'll investigate!
---
You mean by doing those challenges that are impossible due to items they require not being in the game?
---
I have a lot of other things that need my attention more than that so I would rather spend my recreation time playing the game instead of complaining.  Not that complaining is bad mind you, at least when it is justified and serves a good purpose.   I hope you do not think that because you spend time doing that, and associate with like minded people that do it, that a high percentage of fallout players are in agreement with you.  I do not think that is close to being true as most people just do not have a dog in that fight.  So maybe you have 100,000 people railing against repair kits out of 10,000,000 (just guessing) that is 1%.  I could be wrong, but I am thinking I am closer to being correct than you are.  Good luck with your cause, you have some good points but I think most people in your camp are being overly dramatic and that is just not my thing.
---
They never mentioned it unfortunately

The only sink I know of is on the Chemistry Workbench.
---
Just hit it with a super sledge.
---
vault tech armor? either way, I'm not against under armor being a thing. It's just that there should be 2 variants as when it comes to end game we are using mish mash legendary armors which look ugly. It's not like it would be a difficult thing to implement!
---
Spot on, dude.
---
I will give you all my godly 3*s... unrepaired of course ;)
---
Yup I got no shame in using over used comments in the name of conversation
---
Exactly. Why isn’t there a separate sink that you can place? It doesn’t have to act like a water source or anything, just a damn sink.
---
In regards to PVP, by all means, lower your health as much as you want. You put yourself in one shot danger while anyone else can survive at least two.
---
Thanks a lot!

Interesting...
---
That is literally the most ghetto shit I’ve heard in my life, but I’ll try it.

Man i actually really fucking like it, now you can wear x-01 with the stats of T-51 or Ultracite, 10/10 big fan

Still trying to find a camera, sadly

&gt;other players don't have access to.
---
Other players do have access to them
---
These could be for the prestige perks?
---
You are over estimating how many active players are left. Remember the numbers came out this game bombed and very few people are still playing from BETA. 
---
You are also under estimating how many people are complaining about the repair kits. You may want to try doing a quick google search for fo76, and take a look, just try to find a recent(less than 2 weeks old) page that ISN'T talking about how bad the repair kits are and how they are p2w.
---
same. I have found myself grinding for the challenges lately though. Seems like I haven't accumulated the atoms as much over the past month-ish as I did before. I wasn't even really trying before, just playing the game.
---
Guessing maybe I just knocked out most the average non-daily/weekly challenges and now it's slow coming at higher levels? as a non-cynical guess
---
Gotta adapt in the wasteland.

Don't know if it will actually work, that was a random thought.

This is you, one week ago. Sounds like it does affect you. You entitled shmuck.
---
No they don't, they have access to a different repair kit. NOT the repair kits for sale by ATOM's.
---
Right there with you
---
Not an issue looks like ( according to the patch notes it's been fixed.)
---
The camera is weird all around, on Power Armor it will generate extra steps.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted... I agree, it's been a while sense I've seen her glitch enough to not be able to bring her down... there was yet another back to back to back, all overlapping, on the sever I was on and all 3 resulted in completions with kills each time. Huge swarms with 2 of the 3 nukes, large groups for all 3 nukes as well. Smoothest I can remember it being

Shut your crying up . I’m buying 1000 of them now all with rl money

How do the armor lining mods work for this?

The cault tech jump suit in the atomic shop.don't remember if it was limited.

I know, it bothers me so much that I can’t put a sink in my bathroom lol.

If idiots are only still playing this what are the type of people who stopped playing that are wasting their time in the subreddit for it. You love to hate this game because you secretly want it inside of you.
---
this also happens if the camera is equipped during photomode and you select a pose! i just ended up outside of the game's map
---
Yeah, they have access to a repair kit that's *better* than the one on the store.
---
Also, if you're running out of durability in the middle of a fight: you are bad at this game. How the fuck do you not have a weapon with 200% durability, rank 5 gun nut that never breaks?
---
*”finally having some wood again”*

u/eckserah Tagging so sempai notices me. Also great post ;D

I held him for a while for people after posting. Then the server crashed. I’m trying to find him again, no luck in like 20 hops
---
It could even play off the Animal Friend perk and you could ride anything you tamed
---
If the Stimpack only healed you for half as much or the ammo only did 1/2 damage then your comparison is valid. 
---
Repair kits will only weaken higher level players by reducing max Damage output on weapons and damage reduction on armor. It'll help low level players without access to repair perks a tiny bit.
---
They nerfed WK from costing one ballistic fiber for repair to two. That’s not much of a nerf. 10 ballistic fiber is about 300 caps at most vendors

come on... two weeks at best before this is fixed.

empty guns upon login is a mild annoyance for me
---
I want this so bad irl
---
Haha so funny
---
Awww, how cute.
---
I think the plan weight should vary depending on what they cover.  Mom's secret cobbler recipe can be written on a sheet of paper and weigh next to nothing.  Plans for a piece of clothing are similar to the dress patterns you buy at Wal-Mart and weigh a few ounces.  But plans for a nuclear generator could weigh a few pounds.  Look at those Chilton repair manuals for an example of the weight of a manual for something complex.

Happy to!

Yes! So many whiners! If you feel like this is a play to win item then you must SUCK at this game

This is the gamer equivalent of "Leave Britney alone".

So much drama.

I'd made a habit of *not* stockpiling it on this character. Imagine my surprise when I saw 1405 in my crafting menu :P

Added.

Found 2 and gave one to a friend.

Request sent, thank you!!

Lol. What do factions even mean/do for reddit? Is there any purpose to them?

That's actually pretty good in my opinion. I like how the X01 looks, but use T-51b for the stats.

That's not how it works. You have to find the corpse with the camera

Make sure you’ve scrapped all of your junk, bulk everything you don’t need to keep, be ruthless as there’s literally scrap everywhere, (except screws, springs and gears, you’ll need them so keep ‘em lol).
---
Sell the bulk for a nice pile of caps.
---
Other than that, what everyone else said.
---
Huh...I don't know what makes a difference on the SBQ fights. I mention on another post we had 3 back to back, overlapping nukes with large swarms and large player involvement,  no issues. That's two weekend s in a row, no glitches, no drops, no problems at all.
---
People like to complain almost as much as they dislike being wrong =)
---
Harness make it so your armor pieces don't look huge and bulbous!
---
Horse Armor shows that posts like these won't stop people from buying. People with money to burn don't give a fuck.
---
On April Fool's 2009, Bethesda cut all Oblivion DLC prices in half, except Horse Armor. The doubled the cost of the Horse Armor. Ha ha, good joke.
---
DLC sales almost doubled, as expected. Did Horse Armor see this same doubling in sales? Actually, yes, yes it did.
---
Truth.
---
2 pistol perks (maybe?). I AM EXCITE.
---
I leveled my first alt with pistols. Shes been relatively unplayed since hitting 50. With a well built build and nasty weapons found on my main, I still struggle constantly.
---
I already did that. I mean, I found 2 broken prosnap cameras there as well today.
---
I love this idea.
---
Thanks m8
---
Wait till they're done with theyr dungeons...
---
When they're long and exausting enough for your weaponry to break halfway trough, it's gonna turn p2w real fast.
---
I like the ones ingame that actually work. I want that kind Bethesda.
---
I mean, their post history is multiple pages of them defending this, including like a full page of them just spamming that same comment you replied to.  
---
They even made a post, that has been removed, of the same thing.  
---
If anything, they're the one that needs to go outside for a bit :\^)
---
By all the cool things you mean like two things?
---
The Tactical Ops Suit is I think the best addition on the day.
---
The Plague Rider Skin is okay, I guess, but not worth it in my opinion.  It is more like a transmog for other Power Armor pieces because it will always use the X-01 model with the Plague skin.  They should have cut the price in half and made it X-01 only.
---
A paint for your camera?  Really?
---
Imposter Assaultron Head?  Why bother to be honest?  I do not think anybody uses the Assaultron Head to begin with.
---
The CAMP stuff is fun and all but that is all it is, CAMP stuff.  They do not make YOU look badass.
---
And for the record, I am not upset with the stuff.  I just feel that Bethesda can do better.  The Bone Raider Excavator Power Armor Skin Set a good precedent - it was a nice skin and set at a good price.  A $14 skin that is basically just X-01 presents a sour taste.
---
No. 638/800
---
Careful you don’t accidentally scrap a piece as you mash the scrap buttons between item types. Watched my teammate do this last night. He was like “my armor disappeared!” Nope you just scrapped 20 guns and scrapped your armor too lol
---
Lol im the reverse, definitely not buying these only because I don't wanna have less atoms for everything else
---
Hurts to the bone
---
Anytime!

GT: drizzydo on Xbox. It’s at miners monument on my server. You’re welcome to try and join. I have a camp right there so I can get to it easy.

Agreed...maybe not fast travel
---
I was not able to pick them up all the other times i tried so thought I would try today and I could actually get them this time.  Was just trying to help mang.
---
It's still functionally a bad idea to sell under armors on the Atom Shop, as most are going to assume like myself that it functions like a costume. This makes 1 or 2 under armors that have been available for purchase, which like I have said is okay - I don't have an issue with that. I still do not see the problem with having a under armor and costume variant. Personally I don't want to see ugly armor covering this decent looking outfit!
---
This has to be the only case where I’ll actually stand up for a dataminer. Anyone who knows me, knows how much I hate data miners. But in this case, it wasn’t to spoil the game for anyone and actually put to good use.
---
I knew about watogas legendary change. That was among my favorite spawns to farm. They didn’t say anything that I’ve heard but was quite evident that they destroyed watoga. Drills and syringers were claimed to be fixed when they said all legendaries will drop legendary loot now. Several times that has been proven wrong. From getting drills to nothing at all. 
---
I don’t really care if they keep some secrecy because I do want more mystery in the game and mystery where data miners can’t really ruin it for anyone. However, in the case of this post, the data mining was used to prove a point. Perhaps they meant to lower the legendary spawn rate and an idiot pressed 0.
---
We’ve all been saying it. Stranger in numbers needs fixed. Mutations in general needs to be fixed. There’s a 40% damage crit boost card that is broken if you have a crit legendary weapon. Adrenal reaction still doesn’t scale correctly. Demolitions expert is giving significantly less than 60% of weapon damage when applied.
---
There’s so much that needs fixed but they are scooting around to fix some things that aren’t broken or game breaking bugs, while others should be fixed. Five levels put in demolitions expert is a big deal. I’d expect it to perform. Two shot weapons are pretty ruined now as well. The accuracy is so bad that you need skills just to maybe hit your target. Should you choose not to use a skill, a two shot lever will have one bullet go up and the other go down from where you are aiming. Further away, the worse it gets. 
---
This is a bit of a rant I suppose but kudos for using data mining for a positive reason vs. spoiling the game for others.
---
Your dad's cute, found smearing himself in cheese after he heard "Kids will do anything for Dairylea!".

Perhaps it's time to switch to pc where these problems don't exist.
---
Ah, so you’ve never played Elder scrolls online I see. This is nothing new
---
I see bags of salt left at destroyed camps.
---
Is this a non cosmetic, cosmetic item from the atom shop? Looks cool.
---
It would be helpful to get more actual descriptions on where people are finding them. I’m fine waiting to find one on my own, but at the same time I wanna know where to look.
---
Still here!
---
Been a known issue. I made a post about it a few days back, got plenty of replies if you want to read it. But this has been a growing issue for the last 3 updates now. Only acknowledgement was 2 months ago from Bethesda.
---
Tons of posts per day on the subject it seems.. Mostly happens to PA. But plenty of reports of people losing normal armor, weapons, etc.
---
Makes me afraid of playing.
---
It was also in the recent UNOFFICIAL Bug report list that came out after the last update, you should be able to find it.
---
But ever since their last update before today's, the issue has gotten worse.
---
What if it expands the map? Like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Capitol Wasteland?
---
Has someone been trying to make a homunculus again?
---
ok this post should be banned-  "Now take that dick of your shoulder and suck it."

I appreciates you posting this. But I also don't appreciate you for blasting all of us a week ago when we tried saying this (about watoga).  You got me all knotted up in my feels. I choose to upvote because we're all in this together.
---
Or maybe with the introduction of backpacks it could be a modifiable thing where you COULD have saddle bags on the back for extra carry weight while on it? Or maybe its like something you can walk up and activate to store stuff? Like loot a building, go outside, dump the stuff you just got into your bike, then be able to keep adventuring?
---
Something that would allow you to not have to seek out a bench or your stash as often.
---
Has anyone (with separate characters) noticed that SOME perk cards are animated on one character, but NOT on another?  Anyone know why this is?
---
Yeah I was gonna say... WoW had 40 man Groups lolol

Ditto, this has been my experience as well for the last several weeks...she's not glitches once in that time

You guys know where ANY of the bucket list locations are?  Because I have no friggin idea.
---
Are you still on?  World is full so I assume so hahaha
---
The game is an online game ment to be played with people? But that's not really the problem. I said if they keep it un installed it needs to be harder so people have to work together. Otherwise everything's just dead whenever you go in there unless your lucky enough to find a fresh server that no one has gone into it yet.
---
Initially the damn thing was ONLY going to be available for the x-01, that's why there's three other versions for three different power armor sets covering the other horsemen.  But after the models leaked through the data miners and people were pissed that their favorite PA set didn't match their favorite skin Bethesda was NICE ENOUGH to say fuck it and just make them universally applicable.
---
No one had shit forced on them.  The images showed them EXACTLY what they were purchasing.  Every paint set shows an example of how it looks on every set of power armor, this set showed JUST the x-01.
---
I agree that it's not game breaking, but Bethesda did make a big deal about everything in the Atom Shop being only cosmetic. Now that they've gone back on that it's hard to take their word on anything.
---
Not going to stop me from playing, but still worth noting in this discussion.
---
Leave my imaginary wife out of this! Our Nuka addiction is no laughing matter!
---
I love youuuu &lt;3
---
If it is any consolation I am mad at everyone involved, and the corp as a whole. I have entrusted this corp for way too long apparently.
---
Out of context means an excerpt of a larger article, this is literally an out of context quote. It has an ellipsis to start the quote, that is sure sign the whole context is absent. I also see nothing that, as you put it, "clearly stated... nothing would effect gameplay.
---
But you won’t answer a damn thing about how you fucking lied to everyone.
---
Hey Bethesda, why don't you just hire this guy and he can give us all these fixes we've been wanting for ages?
---
I added you my psn is YoungSpud-san
---
That’s good to know, yeah the shit sucks bruh, I can’t imagine losing a rare legendary or something. 
---
Also there’s SO MANY bugs that they ignore. And so many things that should be there but aren’t, like a safe zone slider for console. Every time there’s a server shutdown or a Nuke I’m not able to see the timer as my screen cuts it off.
---
going to get downvoted to hell for this...but why race to all new content? Why not just play the game, explore, do your thing and when you come across it it will be a nice little surprise?
---
Ah repair kits are live. I guess yesterday will be the last day I play Fallout 76.
---
Omw bubby
---
I am! People have been leavin here and there, never been much of a wait. Add me on Xbox and I’ll FT to my camp so you can get to me easy!
---
To be fair they are trying to fix strange in numbers. They entirely reworked how the perk works just to try to fix it and they are still coming up short. I love this game and the only reason i datamine is because others ask me to and to be able to get exact info on some things which are lacking in the game (for example what strange in numbers actually does for each mutation)

---
wow, they're doing such an awesome job
---
meanwhile they could be adding new power armors, like hellfire, or pets.
---
Wait when do you think it changed? Because it literally just changed with these patch notes
---
You can go to a vendor and buy the exact same things a repair kit gives you for caps
---
So they decided to sell repair kits as a single use item.  This is THE EPITOME of pay to win and the intent is to train players that it's okay to buy perks from the atom shop.  Everyone thinking this is 'no big deal' and 'I can repair my stuff better at my CAMP!' are looking at the small pricture.  The big picture is:
---
1.) We told BSG we didn't want pay to win, they promised no pay to win, they put out pay to win items in Atom Store. 
---
2.) Repair Kits are JUST THE START, next will  be numerous CONSUMABLE items in the Atom Store that will do 'just a little' or 'not enough to be a big deal!'. Something like: Explosive Atom rounds! "These quality of life bullets do +10 point area explosive damage only 100 Atoms for 200 explosive rounds!"  Don't forget to pick up the DYNO-mite nuka cola headband to increase your explosive rounds by 2.1x!! only 1000 atoms! To justify that it's technically, kinda-sorta not PTW it it will also be drooped by SBQ instead of plans, ultracite, flux or anything else people want.... 80% of the board will flip out and scram bloody murder. 20% will be saying: "What's the big deal? My TSE pump shotgun with 10% reload rate does waaay more damage.. Whiners... Don't like it don't buy it!", or  "My bloodied Sentinel armor set won't even know you are using these bullets! Stop being a baby!"  or "All 15 of my \*\*\* TSE rifles do10x that much damage pick something else to complain about!"
---
The bullet converter thing they hinted at... wanna bet it's something CONSUMABLE in the Atom store?  Like pay 100 atoms to convert 1000 rounds of something for some other caliber.  The true selling point is you can make Ultracite ammo from .38 rounds just by paying 100 atoms for the ease of life bullet converter kit.
---
The disturbing thing is they had zero plans for ANY input on whether this is was going to happen or not.  This was going to happen period.  The 'we were thinking' and 'looking for feedback' = we are going to sell PTW items you can complain, but next patch you WILL see it in the Atom store and we will simply be silent until the next pay to win announcement.
---
They are like a special card from perk packs. Don’t think they are any better than the ones you actually pick. The last card of every perk pack is animated
---
MY point, I guess, is that having to hit your bench, having weight caps, having to junk and store stuff... is what keeps thing in check. 
---
Now, perhaps storage space will be monetized at some point, the way it is in ESO.. and so be it. But having a means for players to carry 1000 pounds with no penalty just seems like an OP move, to me.
---
It happened to my excavator and my x01 I’m just gonna start making sure I repair it before it breaks. Gonna have to start checking the condition more often.
---
This is so typical of Bethesda... implement something new and not think of all consequences. Don't worry Bethesda, I still like you...
---
That's the inventory I'm talking about
---
You get an animated perk card in every card pack you open, so they are completely random to my knowledge
---
The wording on what the atomic shop would/could contain was changed before release
---
You guys fucking lied to us.
---
This argument is completely WRONG
---
The weapons are not sold by Bethesda in the store, it's sold by players to players. None of that money goes to Bethesda and isn't a pay to win mechanic and isn't built into the game. 
---
Pay to Win is the developer/Publisher selling top tier weapons and items that give an advantage over other players usually for items that are unattainable or at the very least extremely rare in game OR bypassing large parts of the game to get items faster. GTA:O is a good example as the money from shark cards allows you to buy higher tier weapons and vehicles much faster and even unlock campaign missions.
---
The argument is while yes this is a pay to win mechanic it's very minimal BUT there are 2 major concerns 1) Items start to degrade faster making the use of Repair kits a must have for major boss fights (SBQ and ISS) 2) this is just the start and eventually leads to more items affecting game play being added to the Shop.
---
 Just imagine if the Excavator PA wasn't in the game as a quest and was added to the shop that people could buy to increase their carry weight? or what if the Stash upgrades were added to the shop that we had to buy?
---
Post so good, make you wanna slap yo mama.
---
It's the golden cards from perk packs.
---
The yellow "Rare" perk cards that you get (only?) in packs per 5 levels are the animated versions.
---
I'm wondering if you have t51 or t60 jetpack if it shows up when it converts your armor to the x01 style, I mean in some ways this is cool if you like the look of x01 but can't find shocks or jetpack for it, but yea the description needs to state this is how it functions, I thought it was fishy when it mentioned all pa supported but only showed x01 in the pics
---
Nah. It was a slog for me to do solo at 45. I wouldn't recommend it. I'm just stubborn and vulnerable to sunk cost fallacious behavior
---
Every perk pack gives you one perk card with a gold border that has an animation. You just lucked into those cards on one character and not on the other. No functional benefit.
---
Join up. I’ll be here lol
---
I agree. Hopefully as Bethesda upgrades heir servers, they will increase player limit - just as they increased stash and camp limit when they could afford to upgrade the servers.
---
I like most of this lol I think it would be pushing it if we asked for vehicles that we can combat things from lol especially a bike 😂
---
But the armour pieces are in a different column for scrapping. I know I didn’t scrap it because I still had other pieces of raider armour I picked up that I hadn’t scrapped yet.
---
My hero!!
---
This is really tedious. Its a random spawn at any attraction locations.
---
You either get lucky on server hop or you waste caps teleporting to all the locations.
---
For me it’s when I go to places like whitesprings, when the environment has loaded in after a while, and it looks like the coast is clear, only to be insta killed by invisible ghouls who saw me before I saw them. 
---
Or in pvp, if I go somewhere like whitesprings station, where the other people see me before they have loaded on my screen.
---
Or watoga, goodness me watoga, if you run through too fast it turns into a Barron landscape void of structure.
---
Worlds full lol
---
Phillipi battle cemetery is where I got mine and is where I am now :)
---
Thx queuing to join
---
Where do I sell useless items?  Or discard?
---
Just weird..
---
It is an MMORPG...just because it doesnt have 100+ people on a single server does not exempt it from being an MMO
---
I bet any e-mail discussions about the repair kits would read like something out of a vault-tec terminal.
---
&lt;3 I figured I would let my server hopping migraine take the bullet for everyone else's migraine, haha.
---
Id love a dune buggy, youd pack your camp gear in it and it would be tied to your camp allowences
---
Oh it's not a criticism particularly. r/outside exists for a reason!
---
Added, psn is wkrj
---
I was doing the fast travel thing until finally I just stuck it out on one location after about 12 or 13 hops at that location it popped up for me.
---
I couldn't agree more.  I tell my husband all the time that they need to add one.  Though I imagine I'd probably get myself in a lot of trouble with it!  LOL
---
I’m on ps4 so I’ll have to just look on my own. Thanks though. Where is it when you get there?
---
Definitely it would be awesome, but you know Bethesda. Don’t expect too much and you’ll be happy.
---
Joining you now
---
You really think Bethesda was going to spend time to make a slightly different skins for each power armor and sell it in a bundle for $14? Same on you
---
The water park the battlefield and Colonel Kelly seem to be the most popular spots
---
The update came out today and you're already complaining lmao
---
I sincerely hope this doesn't get patched by the time I get home from work.
---
Maybe because they didn't have a massive hate train the moment they announced? Or possibly their more universal, non-american appeal? Or maybe it didn't pan out, because a lot of the games I know of that went F2P supported by cosmetics are no longer around when the cosmetics didn't draw enough income.
---
My buddy acruslly got one of these over the weekend 😂 suffice to say he was pretty mad.
---
They are legendary cards from perk card packs
---
Haven't launched the game since I heard about repair kids 
---
🤔🤔🤔
---
Cool! I’m FTing to my camp right by it in a minute. I’m scrapping stuff
---
Repair kits already remove the need to farm junk and remove risk in pvp as you don't need to carry junk. Hell it entirely removes the death penalty from other sources.
---
Added, PSN is ITS_ CALLUM_
---
Need !=want.
---
That said, I still don't want them on the atom shop.
---
Where is my critical banker card in luck? I want it!
---
You can't miss it, when you walk to the cemetary walk straight towards the monument and you should see it before you even make it to the monument and if you're facing the monument it'll be on your right.
---
Again, I like how you are using data mining vs. others. Stranger in numbers is such a great idea and I’ve been testing it. They somewhat fixed some aspects but others are still horrid. I think my biggest complaint is that when you’re close to a party member with mutations, some of the mutations get a boost, others only give you the negative. They can work on fixing that of course. The part that annoys me is that should you get out of range of the players, it doesn’t revert back. It just cancels your mutations until you server hop.
---
Stranger in numbers is about the most complex theory in the game, in my opinion. If they can fix the range and make the mutations revert back, they would be able to at least make the card situationally ok to use.
---
The other side of it is that if they do fix it, it’s going to bring a whole new level to power for a team. A 25% boost on all mutations is a massive boost. The rare times that I did manage to get a very small portion of my mutations to cooperate, it was pretty crazy.
---
I'm ok with repair kits BUT get them out of the atomic shop and with the vendors.
---
I understand that most folks aren't happy about repair kits being added to the store but that is your final straw???  Really???  Not the multitude of bugs since launch that continue to plague us, the lack of hot fixes, the constant game crashes, nerfing of so many things that made the game feel like Fallout and less grindy.  This was the thing that got you out??  Wow....just wow  Good luck with your life.  
---
I feel like I have put up (and continue) to put up with a lot to enjoy the game.  To give it up now over this seems so strange to me.
---
You're welcome
---
Same 🙌 I remeber before this game even came out they made it perfectly clear this would NOT be a p2w game and that the atom shop was totally cosmetic but its all lies! Ive wasted my time and money.
---
I found this in Red Rocket Megastop:  [https://imgur.com/a/4yNdk2D](https://imgur.com/a/4yNdk2D) but he didn't have the camera :(
---
And I love you, random Reddit user! \*finger guns\*
---
Yea i think this is it
---
Zero clarification?  The pictures show the x-01 model.  People got the x-01 model.  
---
If you look at the pictures for EVERY other PA paint job it shows you how it looks on the t-51, how it looks on the t-60, how it looks on the x-01 and so on.  The pictures for this paint job?  X-01... X-01... X-01... X-01... what the fuck were people expecting to get?
---
So I guess that explains the new sound PA has when landing from high falls. Looks like Bethesda goofed again and made it play for all PA instead of just ones with the Nukashine skin.
---
I did the same thing and accidentally bought the rrbed.  Why do some of the items have a view and others don't.  It was my fault as I had been viewing other items and clicked the button to view which wasn't an option and bought it.  On that note why are some of the beds so tiny?  The four post, hospital and other beds are so tiny our characters hang off of them.
---
Is it worth dropping the gatling? I had thought about shredding but I have no perk support and frequently use the gatling for the resource to damage efficiency.
---
And his wife?
---
There used to be a bug where mods would get auto-scrapped for crafting if your an out of a resource. I fear that they may have brought it back if mods are disappearing
---
Oh no no Im thinking IF you could put a saddle bag it would be like MAYBE 15lbs a piece with a maximum of 2...one on either side
---
A nice touch, but nothing game breaking
---
Whoops, misread that. That's what I get for redditing at work :(
---
Oh god I think I had blocked that out.
---
Added!
---
Ooof 😂
---
Well most of those cryptids you meet once per 100 hours, this is just crazy.
---
The part before that is the question from the interviewer. Here is the entire interview. You'll see it isn't out of context:
---
It's almost like Reddit needs a search function. Here's to hoping it gets implemented.
---
I've been constantly upvoting you for the last 10 minutes, just so I can keep downvoting you!
---
Found it at the fairgrounds! Can't miss him! He's sitting in the chairs that look like they r set up for an audience. I had to server hop a few times but got it after only 5 tries! GL!
---
I hardly ever need to repair. When I saw they were selling this I thought to my self. Who da faq needs this? White knight ftw
---
Patreon is a different beast than ad sponsors, though. Patreon is your fans supporting you, ad sponsors are you whoring your integrity.
---
Do they cycle which one they have in their inventory? I've seen long johns and I think raider leathers at the Whitesprings raider vendor but never the harness. I say that like I've done a bunch of tests but it was probably only twice
---
I did wonder about that. It would definitely free them up do incorporate new factions if it's separate. 
---
But then the current map is already so large I would imagine they would try and get some more use out of it. 
---
Maybe it will be the new factions arriving into Appalachia on the current timeline.
---
Relax your going to give yourself a heart attack no need to be so hostile. 
---
Anyway your idea of a dungeon far differs from mine. To me a dungeon is somewhat difficult group content. Raids to me is even more difficult. What I expect from a dungeon is 2 or 3 decently geared people. They did say content for 2 plus players not one player rolling the whole thing. 
---
I'd also like to see where they call any interior a dungeon? So random tiny bunker interior by your example is ment to be a dungeon even tho they did not announce it as such? Where did they announce that any interior is a dungeon? The only dungeon I've seen announced is Burrows. In fact I think they called it the first dungeon.
---
i feel you.. fully decked out pistol build with a nice furious - explosive - fast reload western but it just doesnt stack up anymore.
---
Right friggen on. It offers no real advantage and supports us schmucks that don't really buy currency because we don't want to or can't. I am all for it.
---
This! 🤔 It could be something like "if the community as a whole can accomplish "x" (relative to the monorails) then they can be made functional" or something....I like it
---
&gt;A decent skin every 2 months
---
Mothman Paint
---
Raider Excavator
---
Silver Excavator
---
Garrahan Excavator
---
The dozens of Power Armor skins yet to be added
---
Blood-Stained Combat Armor Paint
---
Prototype Ultracite 
---
The 2 sets of Camo paint with the Survival Mode launch
---
Re-adding the Quantum X-01 paint
---
The Survivalist's Outfit
---
And now they added the Tactical Ops underarmor to the shop along with one of the 4 Horseman Power Armor skins. Stop bullshitting yourself. They add cool shit to the shop, you just choose to ignore it.
---
+Karma
---
I think you are going to get alot of dislikes really soon bud
---
I personally think NPCS will come on the scene.
---
Walking arsenal sounds like my kind of card. I've got 5-6 Heavy weapons and about 6-7 rifles on me at all times.
---
I load in at the service entrance and run around to the front. As I’m heading to the door those stupid mole rats that are always chasing me appear. They can’t really hurt me but I hate invisible bone worm surprise!
---
😂😂
---
Bethesda please implement age detection I'm sick of all the crying 12 year olds
---
Thanks man. Did you data-mine this info your self ?
---
Right? Especially with all the free online por....oh wait, you’re talking about ingame materials, aren’t you....
---
Oh yea anything can happen is u somehow managed to spam multiple diffrent actions at the same time
---
Added. Gt siestafied
---
I said no!
---
Buy that new "everything convert to x-01 paint".
---
Blackbird is for veteran players only.
---
Alright. Finally got to a scrap place. Headed to my CAMP now which is down by the Miners Monument!
---
The hardest ones to find would be the Flatwoods monster and Mothman. I’m assuming the Mothman in the Event at the Lighthouse counts. The flatwoods monster may be a problem though. I’ve seen it once in about 250 hours played.
---
5-10 minute warning! I'm about to hop off if someone wants to carry the torch
---
I don't support P2W at all and  I didn't say that anywhere in my post.  I also never mentioned anything about me personally paying real money for one of those kits. I grind for my Atoms, but that is my business anyway. I said I can't see how repair kits can possibly be interpreted as providing any sort of tactical advantage over someone given how they have to be implemented. If you want to debate that, then make your argument and convince me. Or not. What I don't need convincing on and agree totally with is your point that the industry is a greed driven, profit above quality anal rape just like everything else in this society.  I am 59 years old and have been gaming for over 40 years. I know exactly what you are saying, but I will give Beth a chance and see how they act before I climb into my Wayback Machine.  I appreciate your reply.
---
Keep the bitching. They don't care and most of the players don't care either.
---
Ok Todd. Nice try tho 👍
---
OK I think I will give it a try
---
No it wasn't
---
Lmao I just noticed that a couple days ago. If they had dropped a 0 it'd have been a long but doable challenge (for some) but now it's just a joke.
---
&gt;How the fuck do you not have a weapon with 200% durability, rank 5 gun nut that never breaks?
---
That is the point, with these repair kits they don't have to run gunsmith 5, or any other perk that slows item degradation, because they can just fix it on the fly if it happens to break mid fight with their repair kits, then run home and fix it to 200%.
---
Normal players won't have that ability, they will have to run gunsmith 5 so they don't have to worry about their weapons or armor breaking mid fight, because they don't have an option to fix it in the middle of a fight.
---
Up voted.
---
My kilt is often damaged and it's about time this was ad*dress*ed.
---
I’ll be here.
---
wouldn’t be the first time i took pictures of dead things for profit
---
Must not be there for me. I’ll just wait, I’m sure I’ll see one in my travels.
---
Ohh ok I get it 👍😂
---
Cowboy used to be the perk for a variety of "cowboy" weapons like 6-shooters, lever actions, and maybe knives?
---
The game desperately needs to consolidate some damage perks and this would be a great step if true!
---
Ahahah my level is 300, have 950 game hours
---
Haha saved caps didn’t you? 😂
---
&gt; You clearly have put very little thought into everything
---
You got this from one comment about repair kits?
---
&gt; and then started making a bunch of illogical assumptions
---
Which you actually did one sentence ago.
---
&gt; go look at the whole scenario and not just from your perspective okay?
---
Looking at a whole scenario can inform one's perspective, but it is impossible to NOT see something from one's own perspective. That's what a perspective actually is.
---
&gt; Maybe then you can come up with something good to say that will change peoples minds
---
Is your homework already done?
---
50-60 Atoms a day in dailies, 55 a day gets you 385 a week.
---
Weeklies vary 150 to 180 total I think.  Close to 550 each week combined maybe?
---
Wait, again? Or just the one nerf where it’s down to 60% max now?
---
You're the one carrying junk into PvP? Thanks!
---
I played it for about a year, but didn't stay with it.
---
It has been on front page multiple times.
---
Lmao why did you delete it!? Speak your mind even if people disagree with you! I personally think it’s a horrible idea, not that it’s not a convenient thing and all it’s just going to lead to more and more non cosmetic things that will be available. I wouldn’t mind having them for fights like sbq or something but I won’t buy them just so hopefully they see the majority of people disagree with this choice.
---
Of course, I point out that they improved heavy and laser weapon degradation rates, on the request of the community, and after they announced repair kits. If they were going to be that dastardly, they could have shrugged and left it be "for balance" or some such rot.
---
Officially no but people have been complaining that Bethesda lied about what the atomic shop could have because of something Pete Hines tweeted prior to release
---
I hear the first one they just released takes all of 2 hours to solo.
---
Swim speed maybe,.  +jump and +swim would be pretty useful.
---
I got another one trying to capture a snallygaster he staggered me and the entire hud disappeared I was unable to do anything with the world , not even re join was possible , had to restart app
---
You can repair your equipment to 100%, which is what the repair kits do, without gunsmith. What gunsmith gives you is 101-200%, and that hasn't changed
---
As a gamer that is old enough to have purchased pong as a brand new title, I can say that I personally couldn’t disagree with you any more than I do this very second.
---
If they're from a developer about their game, they're an advertisement. At least where I'm from, advertisements cannot be straight up lies.
---
Sure he will...…. from all the little crying millennials
---
This is the funniest shit I've ever seen. If they don't hotfix this within 24 hours all faith lost in the devs. lmao
---
Not shameful at all.  That guys just a douche nozzle.  At level 38, you definitely need help!  I've had plenty of lower levels ask for my help with their first nuke.  I usually just run around killing everything while they launch the nuke.  I will also give them stims and make them some ammo (I'm melee build so carry 1 gun with a little ammo on me).  Just ignore people like that!
---
That would also be nice, but I mentioned ceiling mounted because we already have the asset in game (which would probably make it a non issue to sell a plan for building it). I haven’t seen wall mounted turrets so they would probably have to make them as new assets.
---
Could cowboy possibly be the beginning of future buffs for underpowered gunslingers?!?!?!? Huh? HUH?!?
---
\*sniffle\* I just want my pistols and revolvers to be more viable...
---
I'll be using them to convert atoms to caps soon, depending on how much people want field repairs. I'll meet them wherever, take their gun for 0, use the kit, then trade it back at the repair cost. Now just gotta figure out how many caps is 50 cents worth
---
And people who don’t know what they’re doing lol
---
I am disappoint, son. :(
---
It was my upvote/downvote strategy, wasn't it?
---
I didn't delete it? Maybe mods did, but too many downvotes and it'll be hidden I think.
---
I'm pretty sure I bought my CD key for this game from some random online EU resaler for like $4. I say pretty sure but I might actually know that as fact, without a doubt, with complete conviction, but that's just downright ridiculous and cannot be true. I don't even live in the EU. 🧐 Europe wouldn't even tell me the password to its WiFi when I asked.
---
Are you still in?
---
I was just messing around and seeing if I could stir up the hive.
---
I have never complained about an atom shop purchase until now. I legitimately feel ripped off by one of those fine print schemes.
---
Well i have this legendary^^ blackbird painjob, you don't. So who is real hero? :D
---
How many atoms are they?  Won't be on for a long time and too impatient to wait.
---
Bethesda is totally infallible...
---
And a basic "This skin changes both the textures and model of your power armor to look like what's in the provided pictures" would be nice, especially considering this is the first type of skin they've done of this nature.
---
If no one buys this by Saturday i will
---
companies do have a legal basis for keeping promises they made. But there has to be provable monetary damages. We lack any sort of financial damages from their lies so yes in essence. It matters 0% that they lied to consumers beyond what consequences we hand ourselves. if enough people quit the game a message would be sent loud and clear
---
What? Gunsmith is the one that slows damage to your weapons. You are thinking gun nut.
---
With these repair kits they can run their builds without gunsmith 5 because they don't have to worry about when their stuff breaks because they can fix it on the fly then run home to fix it to 200%. Normal players won't have that same ability because they won't be able to fix their gear mid fight and instead need to run gunsmith 5 to slow the degradation down enough to where they won't break their gear in the middle of a fight.
---
It used to be a pittance(like 50g) for most people, but I think it's free now.
---
Found? Do you mean dropped from something you killed? 
---
Mismatched I get but having a matching set of BOS should be hard to come by and literally people are paying for it.
---
I am thinking about roleplaying a reporter. Like a battlefield reporter.  I would hang out at Whitespring and look for teams to tag along with and document their journey.  I think it will be neat.
---
?? Wow you is ma hero, bye children
---
The thought that fo76 has anything to do with what gamers want is #sofunny
---
I gave up looking for it lol.
---
I've left the area but I'm still in the same server if someone still needs it
---
Sigh
---
Those challenges that were impossible to complete because they required items that weren't in the game?
---
No problem
---
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
It is never bad to ask for help. In a game or real life.
---
Just back in after only playing it for no more than five hours before quitting. I thought I broke a quest or something when one of the doors I had to go into was boarded up
---
You can delete them anyway you don't have to wait till it's full to be able to
---
Dont know why you're getting downvoted when this is 100% correct.  Unfortunately tinfoil hat channels like LegacyKilla HD who make shock videos about this kind of thing, convince thousands of people that everything is malicious.
---
I think someone said 50 atom. So 2-4 dailies.
---
Lieing to customers is a terrible practice and im sure most businesses would begin to fail quickly if they started routinely promising things to consumers and walking them back all the time.Doesnt matter what you put in the cash shop if no one is playing m8.
---
You mean if no one sells me one you will?
---
Honestly, if Bethesda had a way to buy Atoms for another player, I would've made a thread earlier today offering to buy someone 5,000 Atoms if they promised to spend it all on Repair Kits.  Just for the salt mining.
---
They (Bethesda) say that they added these repair kits in because some gamers were asking for them? I call BS. I've never heard or seen anyone asking for repair kits. Has anyone out there really wanted this? Seems like a waste to me.
---
I have that quest too and have not been able to figure that out....
---
(Also every time I go there its level 60+ ghouls and I am 28).
---
HOLY SHIT the others ones look sick as fuck. Gotta catch em all!
---
Your...…...
---
Why is it such a priority for you right now? If all that’s left for you in this game are the minuscule (lameasfuckidontcarewhatanybodysays) new side quests that Bethesda is trickle feeding us like heroin addicted lab rats (all while further breaking an already broken game). Then maybe it’s time to play something new. I think my point is to just play the game and stop feeling like every little addition needs to be completed within an hour of the servers opening back up. 
---
I apologize in advance for my negativity, I don’t typically let it get the best of me.
---
Gotta find a body. If you’re on Xbox, I have it by me.
---
No, not again thankfully. Just the initial time.
---
Thx man
---
I thought it was just for the x-01, I didn’t even see it could re-skin other armors.  So strange.
---
I had this EXACT situation occur yesterday.  At West Tek cleaning up Super Mutants suddenly I'm moving like a slug... Realized by 200% calibrated shock right leg broke (fixed it a weeks ago) in the middle of a West Tek run.  Clear out the enemies grab the legendaries and mats and then.... look for a way to fix my leg.  I either need to drop 100lbs to fast travel or hike to the nearest power armor station. Ugh. I'll just walk it to Whitesprings instead of hunt for a power armor station... If I spent 50 atoms I would be golden with the super duper repair kit. Otherwise lump it and find a armor station. This would be exactly why I would like a repair kit on hand, when something like this happens.  So repair kits are awesome.... being able to BUY them in the Atom Store is not.  They should drop like the rarer mats and be able to be purchased at vendors, but not sold in the Atom store by the 6 pack.
---
Well, i know i need to find a body. But which body, where?
---
This is what happens when you use an emote and then use the camera, you fly  ( in my case , to Point Pleasant ) , I didn't die but both my legs were broken and I got an error screen:  [https://youtu.be/kGYpjy5Cv6E](https://youtu.be/kGYpjy5Cv6E)
---
Well you don't need to take a picture of yourself when you get that challenge.
---
I like to take pictures of sights and scenery, without myself appearing in them, I've long forgotten which ones I was naked for when I took them. :3
---
Video games aren’t reality, so those two things aren’t too comparable.
---
True enough and that's why I used that as an example. I am melee dominant and carry 3 Grog Axes for everyday exploration and only switch to heavy guns for SBQ.  You cannot repair a Grognak Axe above 100% since this game came out.  If one of those improved repair kits will do it, I'll use it, otherwise I'll probably do what I always have done and repair my stuff  to 200% at the bench before I take off on an adventure.

I found her (yes, her!) laying at teh feet of teh Mothman statue in Point Pleasant, right beside the museum.  
---
Teh quest itself gives you seven locations, almost all of which are in the marsh. On the plus side, you can start at one (the Pumkin House, for instance) and then move from one to the next without too much effort. I messed up and started in Harper's Ferry (and got out of there just before a Nuke went off!), then rolled north, finishing #6 at the Pumpkin house, then had to fast travel just past the nuke zone to grab the last shot in teh Galleria.

I'll hang around for a while! Please get it and leave the server to make room for others.
---
They don’t their hands and coordination wouldn’t allow it.
---
I'm not buying atoms, I discourage others from buying them too, it's a horrible business practice!
---
I can quit this any time i want. I'm just gonna ~~do the daily quests and some of the weekly~~ wander around aimlessly checking vendors and selling tin cans oh no I have a problem

The name will be feral ghoul golfer and is wearing the golfing outfit.

Also if there are high level players there don’t bother.

I found all mine by the tennis court building and on fairway behind it.

Use the search here, and you’ll find a post that lists the locations.

But I just server hopped at Wavy Willard’s until the body spawned.

It’ll be right in the front parking lot against a car.

Oh that’s some bullshit!!! Just because some one says something that EVERYONE doesn’t agree with doesn’t mean it should get deleted! I’ve heard people say this happens a lot but I guess I’ve just never noticed.

Oh sorry i was under the impression that you where selling  however if u do have the mods i can craft u 1 and give it to u for free
---
one person  promised x
---
that one person is not the sole decision maker of an entire group of people.
---
Its gonna be crazy seeing a group of people all in those skins runnin around im glad they gave each one a unique skin
---
Easy enough. Just use the turrets with the same ammo as the mini gun or .50 cal. Stock piling those ammunition is rather quick and painless and with ammosmith and super duper. I doubt you'd ever run out of turret ammo. Unless you camp the SBQ location or White springs.
---
Ok, I mentioned the wrong perk, big deal, I still don't run with either one when I'm "out and about " and I've never had to worry about breakage. I can think of 1 time my TSE CSG broke during 3rd SBQ fight and I just swapped over to another weapon.  Having those perks in your say to day mix is a waste
---
Okay perfect, thanks man
---
I'm genuinely thankful you posted this, I was about to get it.
---
Day one player here... yesterday I finally bagged ghoul #10. I have hundreds of hours logged.
---
Yeah, I agree, that are bad.
---
It was obvious. The “my friends” part gave it away completely.
---
Any word on if new quests were added this week,  aside from the camera one?  I'm thinking more of the cryptid ones?
---
What is the challenge and what is the gun?
---
You can't earn 50 Atoms in game?
---
ok ok i laughed
---
Apparently I've already killed 8 of them, but I couldn't tell you when or which ones they were.
---
I’m a level 170.  I have gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan 3 and all of the power armor perk cards.  Honestly, I don’t need a repair kit. 
---
But this shouldn’t appeal to me.  It’s going to appeal to the new player or lower level player that doesn’t want to spend their perks on repair or build related cards.  
---
Such is life I guess
---
I actually get it and it makes sense but if they changed it people would have a heart attack...lol
---
Just start you tubing stuff, you'll figure it all out I had too also.. stick to the quest lines for now, look up where to start some if your having trouble
---
That's all? jeez I'll buy several to keep for those rainy days.
---
Yea, the atomic shop is overpriced and full of silly whacky shit.  Give me some cool shit, and make it a dollar or two, otherwise your store will get exactly $0 out of me.
---
Depends. If you like using the Gatling as a main then probably not worth dropping it just for the shredder.
---
I don’t use the Gatling much myself so running around with no ammo isn’t a big deal and I just use the minigun. 
---
That said, the shredder absolutely carves through people. Like scary fast. I have basher rank 2 and an AA Bash Damage minigun that takes down scorchbeasts in seconds. Durability goes super quick though
---
Agreed. Maybe the hacking one makes you have passive hacking skills. Though one for lockpick is needed more. The frog one looks like maybe a light version of marsupial. I'm excited.
---
Maybe the ones in the golf club/resort?
---
I haven't played the other Fallout games yet.  I was going to start 4, but then saw that this was coming out so opted to wait on this.  I've bought 4 &amp; NV so far though.  I plan on playing the rest when I decide to take a break from this...won't be fore a while yet though.  Most people do have a good sense of humor on here...though last night my friends &amp; I were running around with the rabbit mask and clown suit and smacking each other with commie whackers and 2 people at the WS station didn't find it so funny and went after us.  We still had a great time though...and some awesome pictures!  People like these are far &amp; few between though!
---
Yeah, we are stupid and want things to be on their spot.
---
Same with weekly challenge of photographing cryptids. How the fuck should i photo flatwoods monster in one week, when i saw two in 6months? 
---
It is just anoying, go find something with random spawn, that have nothing logical to bring you in. 
---
On the other hand, as soon as you find that camera guy corpse, you see on map what you have to shot? Why i have paper and i know where pumpkin house is.......
---
It just have zero logic.
---
On the stairs close to the monument itself, they wear pretty bright clothing so are pretty easy to spot.
---
I see now that you have the death touch lol
---
Can you show us any proof of that? I just kinda wanna see what its like for science purposes.
---
Sure. Ill be on tomorrow.
---
Ya, big deal, two of the camera ones were in before the camera. I was still able to do all the others without much effort. I've never had to pay out of pocket for any atoms, hell, I'm sitting on nearly 4K and I've bought all the skins and items I want
---
Yep sorry was briefly afk
---
How many Atoms do they even cost?
---
\*Gets one shot by Bloodied Melee Assassins Sentinel Build\*
---
"If I didn't need to REPAIR, I'd have won!"
---
\*Fury\*
---
\*TSE Shotty to da Face about fifty times\*
---
"Your gun should be broken, that's bullshit!"
---
I’m a bit upset about it lol but no problem. Save your atoms cause it sucks.
---
I know. That was too much.
---
That’s daft again, no car is produced to only have reverse drive. But even if such a thing were to exist, it would be manufactured for a purpose where only reverse is necessary so people who would want normal vehicles wouldn’t buy it. 
---
The pipboy sorts fine it’s just lacking features. I stand by my statement even through your absurd reasoning as to why it’s ‘broke’ 🤦‍♂️
---
Ha! No. I specifically meant "you are downvotes".
---
It's the new meta for downvote burns, welcome to the 21st century g'pa!
---
If you see someone... wave. They'll usually wave back. You can emote "group up", too. Note that some people are leery of this due to there being a cheezy exploit that lets them kill the new teammate and take their stuff. But that's gonna be it. a Mic would help. o
---
Character build? Melee is gonna be str, end, agi, mostly. Rifles? per, agi, luck. 
---
Just wander. Wander everywhere. See something on the map? Go check it out. Events just "happen", they're not instanced to your arrival in an area.  Just meander and follow the questline, sorta-kinda, and stuff will open up. 
---
The dudes leveling crazy fast are 100% set on levelling as a goal. Just explore, choose good perks, team up when you can, it'll come. You can grind if you want... but, to me, grinding is a fast track to "bored with this game now".  You get XP from pretty much everything... crafting, killing, finishing missions, doing events... 
---
My advice? Just play it how you wish to play it, in whatever way seems fun to you.
---
It's a sickly green color with some botches.  This is a look t hat could easily be adapted to any power armor.  The other ones actually looked to be armor specific, at least to me.
---
Good luck to you
---
What system are you on?
---
Lmao
---
They increased durability after the repair kits became a known thing. I don't think you need to worry about that.
---
I'm glad you made a new thread about them.  No one has said a word about them all day.
---
Id rather hear the explanation to why ur still here lol
---
See I’m usually the same way, but these guys and gals make being in a big group so much fun. I played solo for my first 150 levels and I’m glad I opened up to bigger and bigger groups. The amount of laughs is worth all the times we have to say “Clear coms”.
---
&gt;I don't think I even need to explain why they're bad at this point.
---
Yes you do.  Because 99.99% of people don't care that they were added.
---
I take pride in my big pistol dragging on the ground LOL
---
At wavy willard's
---
I've yet to find him but keep in mind they can be at really specific spots in these locations. At Wavy Willards, the spawn is leaning up against a rusted car in the parking lot. At the Phillipi Cemetery, they're in and amongst the gravestones. at Uncanny Caverns, they're inside the cave near the entrance near the photobooth area. Still gathering info on other locations.
---
If you’re on Xbox, I have him.  
---
GT: mletS
---
You provided me the context in which the quote came from. Thus making it an out of context quote. Thank you for proving my point. Any quote dictated in any form but it's full orginal form is out of context. That means 99% of all quotes are by definition out of context, that why you have to site your papers, to know the context to where you got your quote from.
---
My initial point of the the atomic store was never announced as cosmetic only is still true.
---
I like the red herring chase from time to time.
---
I think its still a bit high just for a full repair. I think 10 would be a lot more well received. Not like they're paying for them anyways.
---
ROFL, go tell that to the rest of the people in this forum because I tried to say I didn't run gunsmith and was told that I was a noob for not running it. 
---
Now you are claiming I'm a noob if I run it. ROFL. You bethesda boot lickers sure can't make up your minds.
---
It still is an advantage because they don't have to run any perks that worry about item degradation, be it gunsmith, or any of the luck perks that offer repairs. That is an absolute advantage.
---
Even if you want to claim somehow that isn't, not having to spend ballistic weave on repairing absolutely is an advantage because that allows you to make more high end mods for X-01 and t-60 power armors. So either way it offers an advantage.
---
900 hours, seen it once. It attacked my workshop with a scorchbeast
---
Is that sarcasm, I can't tell
---
Yeah how hard is it to repair stuff with junk ? Seems to be something I have been able to manage sense the start. Being able to craft them would be nice tho
---
Notes from the next patch: item durability decreased by 30% :D
---
The quote is literally the name of this thread. Anyone can easily read it and see you are lying.
---
hahaha
---
i made it ontop of watoga tower with this
---
On the way
---
Are people still playing this?   I quit a while ago when support blamed exceptions and crashes on Microsoft.   They are just stringing you along
---
There are always "fore" together!
---
Backpack alternative?
---
Am a millenial
---
couldn't care less about the repair kits.
---
I understand the thought process of a consumable item with the premium currency. Not a fan of repair kits. 
---
Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing firework charges for the flare gun as a consumable. 20 atoms, 50 fireworks, some randomization of what they do. Will let the RP folks have a celebration item and can be used to draw attention. Make the fireworks do no damage to anything (ignore realism for a second) and the players can have some fun for 4th of July or other events. Friends birthdays and such.
---
Tried it, got nothing. But I noticed when you’re in 3rd person PA if you walk and reload the camera there is no walking animation, you just hover around.
---
thank you
---
That's an easy one.  I hope I have enough junk to take care of this one tonight.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Plus poor hand/eye coordination and terrible muscle control.
---
They do give an advantage. You don't even need to have junk with enough of them. Like you never have to pick a single junk item up to repair your gear.
---
This also means you will never get caught with your pants down and drop a bag of junk when you die.
---
None of mine said golfer in the name.
---
They all had golf clothes on.
---
If someone runs the area recently then you'll only get high level feral ghouls.
---
Server hop until you get a fresh spawn and run the houses.
---
Took me several server hops to get all 10 yesterday, finally.
---
No their blog post from Nov 2, 2018 is when they “changed” the wording to competitive. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop
---
Unless you’re saying they edited the blog post recently to cover up what they said. In which case I haven’t seen any proof of that.
---
Geezus christ in a duffle bag why??
---
So much weight!
---
Ella bunker have over 40 bottles.
---
You can craft and scrap 10 boards 1lvl, as melee weapon (they are cheap).
---
You can craft and scrap 10 pipe pistols 1lvl, as ranged weapon (little expensive)
---
Super duper and ammo crafting perks dont count in this, only base count will check in.
---
Make two sets of fusion cells - 40 energy ammo
---
Make five granade launcher ammo - 40 explosive ammo
---
---- you will get .50 cal, with decent legendary effects, that eat 150ammo to kill three protectrons----
---
I've seen the other armors and in those cases it kind of makes more sense.   But this is a sickly green with some blotches.  It looks like something that could easily be adapted to fit the look of all the armors- more easily than the others. At least to me.
---
Can confirm. Quest is trash. 700+ hours and only completed it a few days ago
---
You could repair and drive a car in Fallout 1, so this fits.
---
Your post history suggests you’re like a caveman :( sad that prehistoric creatures cannot appreciate the might of the assaultron head
---
You're welcome bro
---
Yeah, reading and ignoring it. Thanks.
---
So do they then have their entire inventory available at all times/all levels?
---
I am also going incredibly slow on my own, but a few very high levels have taken me to the white springs golf course for xp twice.  It was REALLY fun and easy.  
---
I meet people through area mic, usually.  People without mics are hard to communicate with.  Sometimes I buy something and the person is bored or offers to help me with a quest, or shows me places Ive never been before.  
---
Another idea is to just post something like "anyone want to do (add activity here) at (add time here)?"
---
they've been doing that since release. it's a joke, really.
---
Isn't it just a skin?
---
How much do they cost? I am not playing the game anymore but I am just curios. Going by the prices in the store for paints, I would expect 5$ a pop :))
---
They should just make new emotes free.
---
I don't get it. I bought it and I now have rabbit plushies all over my camp. Isn't that what we all want?
---
I do use the Assaultron Head. Just for fun.
---
Not everyone want to play only with the most OP builds. Indeed, I find them really boring.
---
Don't get excited, it's the exact same picture from better criticals but with a different body pile in the background
---
It happens sometime. You'll get the atoms later for free. At least i did for me when that happened.
---
I've heard that said before. What if I, myself, *am* the high level player?
---
You're a good, dad. Wait, did I just assume gender? Haha - how about, you are a good parent! Need more like you. You should foster. Haha
---
Oh, awesome! Thank you, kind wastelander! I will give it a try! Thanks for the detailed post.
---
Oh god the RMT angle
---
No. Vendor inventories are a lot more static now. There are still some things you need to server hop a certain vendor for but it’s improved a lot since January
---
Hey guys I'm still here for about another 5 min before I have to logout
---
People play it, so it must be what someone wants.
---
A horde of mini deathclaws would be terrifying....
---
SO you just going to ignore one of the most profitable game out right now LoL? It is completely f2p and lives off cosmetics only. Not only do they survive they are THRIVING.
---
You still might need to server hop for rarer items but you’ll be surprised when you trade one
---
Upvoted for ....
---
Feats of Impressive Height.
---
Hopping offline. Sorry to everyone who missed it!
---
I read the note, quest is active, but nothing new is on my map.  Unless I'm blind.  But I have looked over it a few times. :(
---
Ooh, nice! I'll add the extra info to the locations in the main post!
---
Fantastic! That was one of my biggest issues was with the game at the time
---
A grand total of around 12 steel/wood, 8 adhesive, and some other common material to repair a weapon once. Hardly a choir with how long weapons can last with over-repairing and gunsmith. If it's a choir to repair a weapon once every few days, you're doing something wrong.
---
You can easily leave Survival mode for a short while to collect and repair in Adventure mode, and stash additional junk for repair. 
---
At 50 cents a piece and for how effortlessly easy it is to simply collect what you need for repair, I really doubt many people will take "advantage" of it. 
---
Will it have an impact? Probably. A strong one though? Ehhhhhhh, it's unlikely.
---
Even as non impactful that they'll be, I still don't like their existence in the store.
---
Wait will you get home in May.
---
Trying that now lol
---
Why should we follow what a you-tuber does?
---
Maybe...ones with golf clubs as weapons?  Dunno.
---
Nah, full boycott of atom shop would work just as well, if not better.
---
I think they are taking inspiration from ES Blades
---
Since the that last update, number 8 or whatever number it’s being called, I have experience a much worse running game.  Awful frame rate, dead enemies disappearing before I can loot it, new quests not even working, and a good bit of game crashes...
---
This is getting really old.  I like the game, but f*** this is unacceptable 5 months after release
---
difference is everyone knew from the very beginning that shelter was just a cashgrab.
---
I accidentally bought the black sunglasses thing from clicking the inspect button, which registered twice for some reason. It's the same thing happening in other games like Fortnite, and I have no idea why it seems to hard to implement.
---
 The wendigo will scoff and call you a poor when he sees you coming in the free one.
---
Yeah... I figured as much too. Holding on to like 15% hope though.
---
Agree, walking back promises is a no-go. don't buy, don't play. Send a message.
---
Not only that but it was promised before they knew how well things would do. I bet the cosmetics aren’t selling well enough, so they’ve got to switch it up.
---
I find mine all over the place. Seen 4 in my 425 hours. Havnt exactly been looking for them though eituer. 
---
The last one I found was in the cranberry bog.
---
Was his apartment rent controlled?
---
I just used heavy guns as an off the top of my head example. 
---
I thought the energy weapon durability improvements were a month or so before announcing repair kits.
---
Sad. I want my atoms back really.
---
I'm using an anti-armor western revolver rn...definitely not great, but it's pretty good
---
He does count for the alien despite the separation. I wish there were other aliens tho
---
So obviously you're a pretty high level. Any input on what everyone says about them only spawning for low levels??
---
That's pretty rad marketing.
---
They're actually wearing the golf outfit?
---
Upgrade kits probably, level 25 TSE Lever-Action? Use an upgrade kit to level it X amount of levels
---
You jumped from something that someone may or may not consider an advantage depending on how you look at it to something that is completely an advantage, repair kits lead you to think golden bullets are being talked about, thats a very big jump to make, its not logical, i can tell you havent put a whole lot of thought because instead of using your thoughts to convince me that im wrong, you just called me naive, great job, instead of wasting my time, come up with something to say that will actually matter to the whole repair kit scenario, then maybe i can respond your thoughts and you can respond to mine instead of us just attacking each other, or dont saying if dont want to talk about it
---
Are you a lawyer?
---
no i just thought that when they shutdown the servers to day they would have put it in.
---
Or cheaper than 100 atoms if it’s the same damn emote with a different overhead.
---
Scrapped junk worth zero caps can usually be turned into the bulk version (at tinkerers bench) to make them sellable.
---
You can’t sell ammo or gunpowder, so just toss em.
---
I really like some of the stuff, to the point I've spent actual money on atoms, but I definitely want more stuff to be added.
---
/u/eckserah you seem to be on top of the datamining lately, any idea how these will unlock and what they do?
---
Maybe the mounted alien head in the taxidermy shop closet?
---
Great post ecks!
---
I was hoping it was a smart ass kinda wave but nope. Sigh.
---
That would only be the case if it was a new feature to the game. What they are adding here isn't a new feature and is only stopping an aritifically created problem that they themselves put in place. This isn't like they are programing a new cool feature into the game, they are literally just taking away item damage they put into the game.
---
if you open a ticket they might refund you. worked before for other users.
---
k
---
Lol musta had an update this subs back under controversial last hour
---
Briefcase bloodhound sounds like it's related to the VIP tracking event that was leaked ages ago
---
As for the others, got guesses but there's no point speculating yet since there are so many possibilities. Just glad to see they are working on new perks since there are some aspects of the current ones that feel very underwhelming
---
Yep if you played 18 you would probably end with 126 score and that’s not enough to play in the master so your just better off taking them out of their misery
---
On PS4 as well.  I grow tired of loading in then waiting another minute or two for my house to load in piece by piece.  :/
---
Truth. It's hard to take them seriously when they barrel up to you and fall on their faces right before they get in striking range. Embarrassing really. "Get up, man!"
---
That’s what pay to win is.
---
Wait till juicehead finds out
---
The community is in a backlash because the info about repair kits being atom shop items trickled in at the same time as equipment breakage being tweaked to break *slightly* faster. On top of that, it's also flying in the face of what Bethesda told people, that being that the Atom Shop would only sell cosmetic items, when it now sells a consumable (I didn't mind the hero costumes that offered a minor SPECIAL point buff, since that was a weekend event thing that happened once).
---
The first thing you see in the top posts from the past month is the “DANGER: Repair Kits” post....
---
Phillipi worked for me. Saw this thread and tried it. Got it on my first try. They should have made it a set location to avoid angering the players more than they already are about the kits
---
who and what?
---
If you haven’t managed to fix it yet, restarting the system and reloading the game after checking your internet connection seems to help
---
Nice, I was hoping you could find him other places.
---
wtf is that black one? blackbird mk2?
---
I wasn't aware legionaries could not drop while farming repair materials...
---
If that were true 76 wouldn't have even released in the state it did. They don't give a fuck about their reputation at this point.
---
Yeah, you just missed him though.  Keep server hopping until he appears in front of you.
---
Its the red car parked straight past the little security building in the very front.
---
Yes and no.  In this limited case yes, repair kits aren't make or break or even a rational method of playing the game. BUT... Things break... unexpectedly. You might have forgotten to go over all your equipment, etc.. before going out to a nuke event (not hard to do with the messed up repair menu).    I will sometimes (like one a month or so) miss fixing something head out and get caught with busted equipment. Weapons, no big deal, I got a back-up.  Armor? differrnt story.  Rarely happens but it does once in a great while.   It would be nice to be able to fix it on the spot and keep going as a temp measure until you get the 200% fix later.  My solution is carry a back-up armor set (10 lb penalty) or.. buy/find a repair kit and ditch the back-up armor.
---
Its the dead person you have to find to get the new camera in the game as well as the quest related to it
---
Yeah, I'm trying to slowly visit all the spots in my game to get details and hopefully invite other PS4 players to come get him :') I'm really excited about the new camera!!
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
Even at it’s current rate, it seems pretty effective. I have White Knight 3 and Lucky Break 2, and repair my armor/PA maybe every other week (usually get 1-3 hours a day in).
---
The vendor inventories reset each day, so it just comes down to luck between the two raider vendors. Its a basic plan ~190 caps so you will see it eventually. I think there are 3-4 under armors per group, raider, casual clothing, BOS plus the marine wetsuit and vault suit. Raider underarmor is the best for sniper builds or anyone using vats a lot.
---
Well most video games are cashgrabs that why most ask for 60 dollars at release date and then go on to offer special/gold editions that cost even more
---
Your post history is full of... a lot of negativity. I don't mean to get personal here, but have you talked to anyone about your anger issues?
---
Well what if they *do* play golf, but aren't "unruly feral ghoul golfers"? You know, like if they replace their divots and let faster groups play through??
---
It requires both
---
Agreed. But that doesn’t mean they care
---
What do you mean by extra steps?
---
This, I use everything as the same weapon over and over is boring.
---
I'm right there with ya. I was so hyped for TES6 and even for FO76. Hell Bethesda used to literally be my favorite dev because they made my favorite games. This launch has just proven to me that they do not care about me or any of their other customers. I don't know if it was a management change or I was just too naive  to see it before but I'm done with them as a company. I'll keep playing 76 for a while just because my wife likes to play but I won't spend a penny on another BGS game after seeing how they've handled literally every aspect of this title / property.
---
Servers shut down today to add the new camera and fix a bunch of Bugs vender dude won’t be out until next month some time from what I’ve heard
---
You can use a Mr Fuzzy mining helmet, worked for me and its only 20 tokens.
---
Paying money to have an advantage over an in game mechanic = pay to win
---
The fuck outta here were that slipper slop argument. They are a convenience item, and not even a good one.
---
That's the problem. THIS thing seen by itself is not a P2W Scam. But this is a sign of the things to come. They already named things they are looking to include soon in the big newspost when this first came. Fridges that make your food not spoil. Items that let you acces your stash from anywhere, and other things like that. Do they give you a "competitive edge"? No. Having food in your stash not spoil is not a "competitive advantage". But it's functionality. And functionality simply shouldn't be hidden behind a paywall in a premium priced game. I can live with cosmetics, but when they start selling things that have actual uses that you cannot get in the game then that's stepping over the line, and given they already announced this would come right when they first unveiled the repair kits we know for a fact that these are coming. And that's simply not ok.
---
Adding
---
Ty :c, anyway I appreciated the skin and the weapons and maybe i’m just hungry for new weapons skins but really they could improve the way how they choosing witch weapon skins put in atom
---
Not sure why this isn't posted more. Got stuck outside the map.   
---
Funny bug though, only bethesta can make these quality bugs!
---
It’s less likely than farming specifically for legendaries at whitesprings and west-tek for example.
---
6-7 minutes to clear out both, BOOM server hop, 
---
Keep doing that. That’s what people who spend their time farming do.
---
Truth
---
&gt;slipper slop
---
learn how to spell it before telling me to “fuck outta here” lmao
---
OMG really?  This is the first I've heard of this.  I'm going to set fire to my PS4 when I get home.  I'll burn my PC for good measure as well.  That'll learn em good!
---
100% the same like all those shitty gatcha games. It's a 1:1 copy.
---
First repair camera at workbench, craft film, take photos at Freddy fears, red rocket mega stop, pumpkin house, Harper ferry armory, dolly sods, Berkeley spring castle then the galleria.
---
Thats next update
---
Oh, if upsets anyone that doesn't already see this for the gross lack of subtlety in the testing of the waters that it is, boy are you not ready for the spicy armpits in your immediate future.
---
Thanks for the helpful input.. 
---
 "---- you will get .50 cal, with decent legendary effects, that eat 150ammo to kill three protectrons---- " 
---
It took me 5 bullets to kill lv50 protectron... Maybe your build is a little wonky
---
That's not necessarily true. ESO sells repair kits, soul gems, food, and exp bonuses, but they've never sold gear. Doesn't make it pay to win yet.
---
Sorry for that i’d never see them, but i think you could get my point
---
Lol you're fast. I already corrected that before you called me out.
---
It falls under 'casual' so any mods labeled for the casual under armor would work on this.
---
Or, I’ll do what I like since I’m an individual and anything that I do doesn’t matter.
---
I use the thirsty and cooking emotes a lot.  That's very disappointing that it's not a new animation.  :(
---
Highly doubt it, if Bethesda wants to add p2w they are gonna add them regardless. Armor kits are being blown out of proportion. They arent p2w, its convenience, if people choose to spend atoms on a repair kit instead of a workbench that's their choice, literally all it is is using atoms to save 20 caps on fast travel and a couple junk scraps at the most. How about wait until a real p2w atomic shop item pops up to lead the rebellion?
---
Not sure where you asked... but people here are more than happy to help. I nuke several times every night - happy to have you along if you're on PC. IGN is same as my reddit name.
---
No you haven’t but there are weapons and weapons
---
You "heard"?  It's been out for a week.  But I understand.  You spend more time stirring up drama than playing the game.
---
Ok, now you're just the very definition of "Unpleasable Fanbase"
---
Players: Bethesda add more cool stuff to the Atom Shop!
---
Bethesda: *adds cool stuff*
---
You: iT dOesN't hAvE cUStOm mESHes So IT doEsn't COunT
---
This is why I think modders have too much of a big ego in this community. And we're never getting pets.
---
I have a quad assaultron head and I use it quite a lot
---
~100 damage per charge with perks, so I can get off a single shot of around 2000 with a pistol when fully charged. Not to mention any drugs or mutations, or sneak attack crits
---
Or new players
---
So most of us had already purchased long before that was ever published. I hadn't even seen it till just now.
---
Here is what the Bethesda FAQ for Atoms says 
---
"While you play Fallout 76, you’ll earn a currency called Atoms by completing various gameplay challenges and achievements. This currency can be used to acquire in-game cosmetic customization items for your character, earnable entirely by playing the game.
---
Atoms can also be purchased separately for real money if you so choose"
---
I mean it is pretty obvious what their marketing intent was here.
---
Awesome coming to you!
---
Last time I tried to pass them on the course they were very rude, they started yell and then went on to attack me. Now my son doesn’t want to play golf again. Don’t even get me started on how the staff treated me at the club house.
---
I find myself running out of ammo in battle, I've never had my gun breaking ruin a fight for me. Also to be fair the only reason I'll run out of ammo is because I use heavy guns and sometimes I'll end up having to fight 4 SB back to back. Now that I have legendary version of my old guns so those days have stopped.
---
I only have 14. 😬
---
Play the game kill some things (:
---
OK ok. I can check there as well. I mostly down robots there, but I'll look out for any others that glow! Thank you!
---
Added oscar_goku_wick
---
Do you happen to have a spare copy?
---
K!
---
Gotta help other people. I make it a habit to drop my extra plans for new guys, things like recipes and weapons useful for their level. Gotta get heart emotes somehow. &lt;3
---
Because he or she is a consumer who is dissatisfied with the direction they’re taking with a product they have enjoyed?
---
What kind of buffs? Experience boosts? Not a pay to win problem. Caps boosts? Arguably getting there. Damage or defensive boosts? That'll.never happen.
---
I know! I really wanted it to be. I’ve been wanting a laughing emoji and a shocked emoji but they give us recycled crap with a new overhead.
---
We're currently looking into ways we can increase photo gallery space for console players in a future update. I don't have any details or timing to share beyond that but I'll definitely let you know as soon as there's any news on that front.
---
Dammit beat me too it XD
---
All I got from your comment is a hope of stronger  throwing knives.
---
I've lost a dozen items from my stash over the past couple weeks. Weapons, mods, and aid items. Wouldn't have noticed bless I was logging my inventory on my mule. Don't know where my bloody submachine gun went damn it. I liked that gun.
---
This. And by rephrasing their promise from "Only cosmetics" to "No Competitive Advantages" they even greenlit themselves. Having your food in your stash not spoil is not an advantage in PVP so it's not an competitive advantage so fridges are totally fine guys! Everything is fine nothing to see here move on! 
---
But if they really pull through with that then that's the point i just quit the game and move on. I've had fun with the game, if Bethesda wants to turn this into one of these Free-2-Play games where the basic access is "free" (except it actually costs a premium price in this case) and you have to buy every functionality separately then i'm just going to leave this behind.
---
Lol. Are you the bunny guy?
---
Why what?
---
So bring another weapon.
---
Not really, why shouldn't Bethesda make skins for less popular weapons? Yeah not a great deal of people may use them but if you don't add anything for that weapon you alienate the ones who do use it and annoy them. 
---
I'm all for more skins for less used weapons, it might make me start to experiment and use them. At least this Atomic shop item is more fallout related compared to some of the other stuff you get like the dresses...
---
That's not so bad then. 
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
Hi! We're looking into ways we can increase the photo gallery limit for consoles in the future and we'll let you know as soon as we have more details to share.
---
Well when they first revealed repair kits they already announced they're looking to also add a fridge and a way to access your stash from literally anywhere in the same way so...
---
It depends on the player.  Upon starting, my immediate goal was to get ahead of resources and find revenue streams.  I lived off whatever I could find.  So even as a new player, repair kits wouldn't interest me.  It's a temporary solution to a permanent problem.
---
Took a picture of Flatwoods monster, didnt count towards alien. :/
---
You know for a dead guy he sure does get around the wasteland.
---
*Duuuude*, sorry to hear that. There's always gotta be that one group out there, who either can't hold their liquor, or thinks going out every other Saturday is getting them ready for the friggin' Masters.
---
You right, I think too it’s a good looking and fun weapons but i fell like something is missing, like when i see the red baseball bat just it, i’m not mad
---
Yeah, this whole situation has just left a very sour taste in my mouth in regards to bethesda, I've lost a lot of respect I previously had before this game came out.
---
I was so excited when this game was announced, I loved bethesda games and was excited to throw money at them, I was actually excited about the atom shop at first when I heard it was going to be cosmetics only. I like buying skins for my character, gear, and settlements/camps.
---
Now? I probably will not be buying the new elder scrolls, starfield, or any of their other games such as rage 2 etc. I won't be spending a penny in the ATOM shop. 
---
The only way I would even THINK about doing anything of the sort, they would have to  get rid of this repair kit, and any future items that have in game effects that effect game play. They would need to put out a serious apology on how they are being so disrespectful towards their customers and lying to us. They also need to make a serious change on how they are handling everything.
---
Look, here I can even off them a wonderful way for them to increase their profits without having to go down p2w route. Make more CAMP items, make raiders gory stuff available, make a ghoul skin available for players, make skins for tamed pets, make more emotes with animations, make more skins for different guns.
---
They could have had a gold mine if they played this right, unfortunately they have already done too much damage i'm afraid and I don't think they can save face after this repair kit garbage.
---
and in every one of those threads is responses form people who don't see them as the end of the world as we know it.
---
World is full. Im in the queue. Guess nobody is leaving after they get it...
---
Nah, this won't work. People have plenty of mats to do repairs already. Plus these repair kits are pretty shit and only go for 100%. If anything people would be repairing with the rare ones that drop from the SBQ, not the dinky atom shop ones
---
That hate existed before even the betas launched.
---
You can loot a Mr.Fuzzy hard hat/helmet out of a portable toilet near the water at Quarry X3 in the cranberry bog. Works for the challenge and costs no caps/tokens.
---
I do have a mod, or I can add it to combat armor now.
---
I'm on XB.
---
I’m not 100% but try Resin bot over at top of the world. The one in the ski lodge. I think that’s where I got mine.
---
EA was the first to implement things like this, lootboxes and microtransactions in the big style, but the first ones to make this acceptable in the industry were Blizzard. People just like to ignore that since Blizzard is their darling and can do no wrong. But i vividly remember the real money auction house in Diablo 3 and how Blizzard made lootboxes in premium games acceptable in Overwatch...
---
Thanks!!
---
&gt;	There are plenty of people willing to support the game
---
That’s very easy to say, but we don’t have any evidence that the figures were backing that up, and some that they weren’t (like the fact that they have resorted to this).
---
Add in the fact that every day there were non-obtainable daily challenges last week, and two non-obtainable weekly challenges...
---
First thing I tried and sadly no. Would have been so cool though.
---
Just wait, once I get my hands on a repair kit, I'm going to one shot the server farm.
---
So that is an advantage that those who buy repair kits won't have to do. So they will have more space in their inventory for gathering, you are just proving my point that the repair kits give an advantage. Every excuse as to what I could do differently is exactly my point, that is something someone who paid cash for won't be required to do.
---
Add sent
---
Ah u got me..
---
It shows their handicap over their heads.
---
Nice! Thanks, I'll go check that out now.
---
50 caps each, a few dailies and you'll have enough lmao
---
Bullshit. 
---
You figure players will stop carrying junk now? Come on. Stop with the speculation.
---
If someone wants to spend a shit ton of real world cash so they can pay for what i can do for free... and thereby keep revenue flowing and a game I like alive... fuckin' give'r. Go for it. You pay to keep those servers running, dude. 
---
I'll keep repairing my stuff the same way I do now... and if I die and lose a pretend bag full of pretend crap that I gathered while wasting time on my couch... oh well. I guess I'll have to enjoy myself playing video games for a few more minutes to get it back.
---
Fair play to you, then. I’ll continue playing until I stop having fun.
---
I'm buying 10 just to frustrate the people leading revolts here :) in the bank
---
If anyone is on xbox n has found it let me know I haven't seen it yet n would love to server hop to one that has the tourist there
---
For my childhood, have to F
---
In White Springs vendor next to room with all the benches. Expensive though! I’d check other Reddit’s like the bazaar for them. I’ve seen them as low as 1500 caps.
---
I cant get in.  World is full
---
I'll try now, thankyou!
---
This world man. Just the other day I went watoga because my wife always wanted to see the city and I finally saved enough caps to travel and border patrol started shootings at me.
---
It's Bethesda who keeps asking for feedback. So we give them our feedback. Of course they completely ignore it 100% of the time but hey, we should let them hear our displeasure anyway. Just turning our eyes away and pretending a problem doesn't exist is retarded.
---
I'm repeating myself over and over: 
---
 repair kits turn condition and junk into revenue decisions instead of just game design decisions.
---
I don't care what they cost, how convenient they are, or that a premium version is available in game only.  Repair kits taint design decisions.
---
Its a dead settler type of corpse. Hes wearing a teal shirt and jeans
---
"Cashgrab"... gamerspeak for "product created by a business for the purpose of generating revenue".
---
I've yet to see him personally, but I saw a pic earlier! It's a 'fresh' body (looks like a person, not ghoul-like or a skeleton) named Ansel wearing a Nuka-Cola shirt and jeans outfit. I believe the book and camera are at his side.
---
Some screenshots here if it would be at any help: https://imgur.com/a/mjE7MgX
---
ok cool
---
Okay. I thought so, and amended my post. Quite a few people are hanging around.
---
Sorry, but only an idiot goes out into the wasteland with a single weapon that they expect to handle every situation that comes up. It's just good practice, not only because of weapon degradation.
---
Oh don’t worry, I’m all too aware of what Activision and Blizzard have done. I just chose to specify EA because they started it all. Good contribution tho
---
Obligatory “it was the first thing I checked” reply.
---
Thanks! Finally got in and got it!
---
I gave up on this one about 4 months ago, and stayed at 2/10 until just the other day. Then all of a sudden I have 8/10, and honestly I didn't think I was doing anything differently.
---
Tyvm for sharing this info
---
will the president protect me in acts performed during HGM? (Heated gaming moments)
---
How did you proc that quest?
---
I would, but Ive not bought any so far at all. Im not going to buy them till they get their shit together. They were frankly almost there. And then they fucked it up with this ptw nonsense.
---
Run for your knife Im guessing is decreased AP cost for sprinting with melee equipped.
---
They may be trying to reel in the stuttering that has had a fair bit of mention here. Only a guess.
---
Fucked if I know, but here we are. Maybe they’re being too generous with the free atoms.
---
don't know about everyone else but the raider and horsemen skins are the first thing I ever bought from the shop **precisely** because of how low effort recolors really are. it's not quality content, never was. blackbird gets a pass because of how shiny the default x01 is.
---
&gt;This is why I think modders have too much of a big ego in this community.
---
because they can do an infinitely better job than Bethesda?
---
&gt;And we're never getting pets.
---
at this rate we're never getting anything that requires more than opening up photoshop and tinting everything gold/silver/rainbow. only more repair kits.
---
Damn that would’ve been nice...
---
It is literally something those with these repair kits won't need to do. That is the point, they will have that advantage to do that without fear of their weapon breaking.
---
The sound effect of walking. Haven't observed any other effects, but it's weird.
---
Yea it’s a bit crazy you can reskin other armors, but I’m alright with it, I saw all the “horseman of the apocalypse” type skins and was like: I’m getting them all, don’t even care. xD
---
I read on Reddit here about going there when low levels where there and it worked! I gave up and turned the quest off myself until I read that.
---
Honestly though, I lurk Reddit often and have yet to figure out the search function.
---
I’m not making new posts asking questions that I know have been asked before though. I simply let that info be lost lol maybe I’m too dumb for Reddit lol
---
How are these not advantages? If two players have the same load-out and are at the same level, but one of them has a repair kit, the player with the kit has an advantage over the other if they fight.
---
In the same place you'd find it on any other system
---
Agreed! Would be super cool to get a visitor list. Like a Wasteland Bed and Breakfast.
---
Investigate ways to keep this in the game for.....ever? Right?
---
PA condition deteriorates at such a slow rate that I've repaired my suits only once since starting in December. I also never repair my weapons due to Luck of the Draw perk at Rank 3. There's literally no reason to repair items on the fly in-game unless Bethesda decides to increase PA and weapon deterioration speed and nerf the Luck of the Draw and Lucky Break. Which if they do I will riot lol
---
Repair kit repair kit repair kit
---
Y’all are unoriginal and fucking lame. If you don’t like the game, fucking quit and stop bothering those of us who dgaf
---
Are you on today? And do you still have the copper?  😄
---
I'm at about 300 hours and have never seen a flatwoods monster
---
Indeed he does!. Thanks man. Saved me a fortune fast travelling around 😂😂
---
There's nothing mentioned in the patch notes about camp immunity.
---
Well Grafton monsters and wendigo are decently common.
---
Oh yea, Quarry X3 look for two toilets on the west side of the lake. Its in one of those.
---
Yeah that is definitely weird.
---
thanks again, he was right on the steps of the monument.
---
I mean those 50 cals can barely hurt a cazador. Weak.
---
Lovely lol
---
I did the quest in my fourth playthrough. No luck with a lvl 120, no luck with two consecutive lvl 55s, finally joy yesterday with a lvl 78. Spawning appears dependent on how many people are on the server.   
---
   
---
I like this last alt... melee and commando with tons of luck for learning mods. A three star deathclaw gauntlet and a lvl 50 perfect storm.    
---
NOTE TO ALL: don’t do the Miss Nanny waterpark quest until lvl 50 as that gun is OP.
---
I agree. They started releasing some actually cool stuff lately that i'm willing to pay money for. But anything that actually adds functionality is simply not ok. Repair Kits are the smallest of the problems, but they already said they'd add a fridge and a way to acces your stash from anywhere soon and those things simply are absolute 100% no-goes. Add something that adds functionality in such a way into the atomic shop and i'm done with this game, simple as that. They keep throwing their "We're reading all your feedback" bullshit everywhere on the Reddit, but they keep ignoring 100% of it and i'm really getting tired of this.
---
To help level a little faster, be sure to be well rested (sleep when you log in). You will get +5% XP. I will even top up my sleep in the middle of a quest lol.
---
Collect cranberries on Aaronholt farm. Then make cranberry cobbler for +5% XP. Or if you can get a hold of some gourds (and sugar), make cranberry relish for +10% XP. 
---
Then, sure, you can do Whitesprings. I do it because I have fun killing ghouls and the occasional bear, deathclaw, grafton monster on the grounds. Plus I do a lot of looting for resources and selling there. 
---
I'm almost always on a team (which is different for you). But if you are ever on a team and can afford it, put the inspirational perk card on for additional XP, or see if a teammate can share it.
---
Lol y y’all using a 50 cal on protectrons in the first place!?!
---
Me niether.
---
You forgot the /s
---
Yus. And occasionally have part if it break down or be attacked by super mutants. Good foder for New events
---
what you're saying is basically videogame nihilism. "we're all gonna die anyway, so what's the problem with Todd screwing me over"
---
it's anti-consumer, that's what. stop wasting money on monetization experts and start putting out more quality content and bug fixes. but I guess those require actual effort.
---
T-60 is ok but T-45 was not translated well to the new power armor system that was introduced in Fallout 4. Looked better in 3/New Vegas
---
No, one MIGHT have the added convenience of not having to switch weapons or find a repair bench if their weapon breaks during said fight. Having an item in your inventory is not an advantage.
---
Next.
---
Wasn’t there talk about making camps safe from being destroyed? Didn’t know if that was official or released...
---
I found a note in a toilet at valley galleria pinned to the wall
---
Or Todd and friends wants to milk us dry
---
When repair kits got announced it was like the community manager swerved around replying to posts about it. im expecting it’s cause the higher ups tell them to ignore them
---
Bethesda mentioned it but haven't released it yet.
---
I think that's what the patch meant yeah. One person per pylon maybe.
---
+karma thank you!
---
Yeah honestly whenever I want to search for something on reddit, I go to google and search:
---
site:reddit.com whatever I’m looking for
---
It’s better and usually faster than Reddit’s built in search.
---
I don't think you understand the full implications here. They are essentially paying to remove risk. It is a total circumvention of game consequences.
---
on their website. log in and open a ticket wherever, they'll put in contact with the right person if you mess it up.
---
Ok I'm coming in now!
---
When you promote an online mmo to a community that has always expected single player story filled games from you what do you expect to get? Cheers and applause? Especially when every game that is released today is live service and you were the last hope to "save player one".
---
I might climb it and try again if they decide to increase the camp placement boundaries.
---
It would be nice, but how will they make money for the game to continue? Any online game that wishes to continue need to make money somewhere. You wouldn’t work for someone for free would you? If we had to pay for every dlc that comes out I could understand, but not converting the only source of income to only kill the game because everyone wants something for nothing.
---
And here I am badly sneaking up on them and getting pimp slapped. Smh
---
I wonder if that's an "ansel adams" reference...
---
That is still the FAQ today btw
---
+karma no problem
---
Please remove the repair kits from the atomic shop! This post literally says they know it has competitive advantages.
---
"While Repair Kits do offer a way to fix an item in the field, we feel you will find that they are a convenient (PAID EXCLUSIVE) option you can utilize during your adventures"  
---
IMO, being able to repair your weapons on the fly mid combat is a P2W mechanic. People who don't or won't buy them will have to return to there camp to repair their equipment. People who pay will be able to keep fighting unlike others that don't want P2W in Fallout 76. Bethesda if you are serious when you said
---
"When we originally announced the Atomic Shop last year, we said that it will not provide anything that offers a **competitive advantage**. **We remain committed to that statement** and take it into account when we evaluate every new item that we bring to the Shop, both now and in the future."
---
You will remove this item from the atomic shop and add it to the regular world space. It is P2W, as it overs an in game combat boon over people who won't pay for it. I want to say to anyone whose read so far I love this game and I want it to succeed. I would be lying if I said I was a fan of micro-transactions. I just feel we need to share our opinions on this to Bethesda or more and more future content will be sold piecemeal to us through the store. I don't hate the Atomic shop I just personally think it should just be cosmetic only. Btw repair kits sounds like an awesome item that would fit right into the world, it's being wasted in the atomic shop IMO.
---
Ps Bethesda. If you add Brotherhood Items (Cosmetic) to the Atomic shop I would probably buy it all for real. 
---
(Ps. Ps. T-45  PA Brotherhood skin *fingers crossed* )
---
TL:DR Yay for more bug fixes, but boo to P2W Repair kits (and possibly more P2W in the future to)
---
Yeah, give us this instead of fridges and Open-Your-Stash-Anywhere items Bethesda.
---
On my way! To check it out. Thank you.
---
Thx.enjoy the AA powerfist good sir.
---
That's me with the tuxedo you're awesome man. Want anything?
---
Theres also a bug that has been present since the 1st day and that is challenges that can't be completed, usually it only occurs to the "find this location" challenge but its still annoying as it prohibits earning atom.
---
Thanks to both of you, had 2 of my friends over as well, very nice :)
---
it's more about the stats. T60 is a great starter PA because of how cheap it is to repair, but everything pales in comparison to X01 and T51b.
---
and T45... well... is just plain terrible.
---
That’s great, and nice timing. I actually have to be off for a bit now.
---
Thanks for the report on this, we're actively looking into this issue. 
---
If any of you who have encountered this happens to have a video of the body disappearing would you mind sharing that with me? It would be helpful during our investigation.
---
Yeah I saw. 
---
To play devil’s advocate, they didn’t say it would be strictly cosmetic.
---
Yea the brick walls have been like that for a while. One of the more annoying bugs in my opinion.
---
I dunno, as i said, EA didn't start this, Blizzard did. EA just was the first to implement it into literally every game they make, where Blizzard was still pushing the peples limits bit by bit.
---
Are you in passive?
---
I’m good, thank you.
---
None of them get this. They wanna complain to hear themselves complain.
---
Nope, I've had fun for 500+ hours.
---
Same here lol world still full haha.
---
because it ruins 'm'mursion
---
Yeah. Ok. 
---
Heh. The sheer pearl-clutching drama of this forum is hilarious.
---
Power armor takes EONS to break, especially with the perk reducing how quickly it degrades. It takes at the very least a real life week for a single piece of my power armor to break, and typically everything else is still above 150% condition. Don't know why, but enemies seem to only target the once piece 90% of the time. Crafting armor is what takes a good chunk of junk, not repairing.
---
If you haven't collected enough material to repair them, then I'm not sure if you're even actually playing the game at all. Like springs for example. Camp McClintok has an absurd number of clipboards. It only takes a few minutes. If you want to know where to get junk, all you have to do is ask or search for it on reddit or elsewhere.
---
If you NEED to buy any of that material just to get by, then are you playing the game at all? You'd have to actively ignore almost every bit of junk you come across to not have enough material for the very occasional repair. If you only pick up what you know you need, it doesn't require a great deal of effort at all. Why pay 50 cents to repair something, especially when it doesn't even over-repair it? It is extremely low value for your atoms.
---
You don’t know what I am thinking about. Don’t try homes.
---
It hasn’t been longer than a couple minutes wait I think. I’ve gotten crashed a couple times and been fine
---
Harpoon gun.

If anything is clear from recent talk from Bethesda, it is their internal communication is horrible, perhaps to the point where different groups are actively at war with each other (dev, marketing, community) Burrows hype/reality and repair kits are just the most recent examples.  This makes me worry as to how bad the purveyor will actually be compared to the very minimal information we’ve been given.
---
I see one where you sprint 15% faster with knives or perhaps one handed weapons. 
---
I'm thinking one park allows you to unequip your helmet of your power armor without some kind or limited repercussion. 
---
I'm wondering what the Frog legs one does.
---
I’m guessing your not there anymore?
---
Lacking necessary features is pretty much the same as broken. So much so that it's a waste of time to try and argue about the difference.
---
P.S. don't hate on my reasoning just because you don't agree with it. It is sound AF.
---
Same, at 300-400 hrs now and am eager af to log on after work tonight!
---
Is there a map infographic for these potential spawn points?
---
This. Superior to what? I can repair beyond 100%, am I beating P2W?, just collecting stuff in game. And it’s not like I only carry one gun- one breaks? Switch to another, repair it when I’m back at base.
---
You are missing the point, it’s a multimillion dollar company, this is a slippery slope, something about jazz. Am I the only person here how can follow instructions?
---
You foolishly expect people to be adults about it and not throw temper tantrums that the game is not what they asked for.
---
Some of these are hilarious
---
I would have no problem paying for DLC. Just like any other game that I enjoy, I'll drop some extra coin, no problem.
---
I yell at them lol, and I don't stop until they leave. Works most of the time.
---
I don't think it's ever got me killed, but I'm constantly getting into firefights only to discover my guns are empty. It's more annoying under those circumstances...
---
Sutton station has them aswell
---
I get the opposite, I get rifles and shotguns with 250 rounds in it. Won't let me reload until i drop below the number it's suppose to be
---
I added you
---
The draw distance is remarkably low sometimes.  I get a hideous low-poly Poseidon nuclear plant if I look at it from across the channel.  Not even that far.
---
It's there now
---
Half of those skins are not even cool though.
---
The Quantum X-01 skin was ported directly over from Fallout 4.  Plus it is not in the Atomic Shop and can be obtained in the game for free.
---
The Silver Excavator Skin is pretty basic.  All the default Power Armor skins are basically that.  It is still alright nonetheless.
---
The Garrahan Skin should have been earned in the game because the Excavator Power Armor posters show that exact skin.
---
The bundles with the camouflage Power Armor Skins were simple reskins.  They used the same camouflage pattern but with different colors.
---
The Blood Stained Combat Armor was, again, pretty basic.  You can just smear some blood over a texture and call it a day.
---
The Survivalist stuff is pretty ugly but definitely works well in Appalachia.
---
The Four Horsemen skins are definitely nice additions but they were leaked weeks ago.  I am not sure why it took this long though.  It is a bummer that the Plague Rider is 1400 Atoms for it being just an X-01 skin.
---
Everything, all around it, the substation is like lego bricks, hills are just flat /blocky textures you can't use a Recon scope or it just spoils the while thing...
---
But its not pay to win.
---
I'm not? I simply replied to what you posted. I spent 60 bucks on what I assumed would be a quality game with no p2w content, as per the developer's original comments. the fact I bought it doesn't mean I should be screwed over.
---
what you said makes no sense.
---
If you don't get the plague walker mutation, you'll be doing yourself a disservice.
---
No. I've gotten my money's worth out of the game already. And I've met new friends. Everything from here is gravy.
---
When have you known gamers to not get angry about getting screwed?
---
It doesn't scale like that anymore.  It caps at a 30% reduction to incoming damage.
---
If you are on right now my gt is Goodnewsevery01 and that's a zero.  I'm right in front of her at Phillipi right now!!
---
Uh oh, you forgot to bring your back-up weapon, so did I! But I have this handy dandy Repair Kit that I use to repair my gun and kill you. Damn! That was intense and fair.
---
Nope, promises no matter who makes them are made to be broken. It's life, so you either accept the fact or move on with distrust.
---
Will I buy these repair kits? No, because I'm swimming in junk and can +200% in no time so I see no personal need for them myself.
---
Higher level ghouls can be killed with a low-20's character with a melee weapon, but don't get mobbed. I got stuck in a bathroom at The Whitespring and things did not go well.
---
SydneyDunham I'm at the Kelly monument right now
---
none of my areas spawn a tourist , nothing is there
---
I've mentioned this when the patch was announced. I actually love taking photos of easter eggs. Please don't make me delete my Wooden Blocks REDRUM or my Teddy bear on a raft.
---
It was never this bad before, took a 3 or 4 week break, had 250 hrs in or so before that, never seen it this bad, not even close...
---
Right, that's the one!
---
I am not saying it is hard to collect the junk, but there is gameplay and risk involved in collecting said junk. Some things take way more time to collect and trade for than others.
---
These kits totally disregard that, they don't care how much ballistic fiber or springs you need to repair.
---
Not to mention they can also interact with the in game economy now. I can buy a bunch of these and sell repairs for scrap, undercutting the price of repair components on the market and essentially enabling a form of RMT through the atom store.
---
Just got it. Thank you!
---
Found Ansel at Colonel Kelly Monument, he is on the bench upstairs, just near the monument itself.
---
RickyLegend5000 has a 2 shot gauss explosive for sale
---
That is a different concern. I am simply stating an opinion on the conversion of caps to atoms. I agree some prices are high, but I disagree with the ability to convert.
---
Repairing your armor to only 100% isnt pay to win.  Everyone will still be using perks to repair armor to 200% for the extra defense.  If you are buying them, your low lvl and not winning
---
Yea I really wish I could have undershirt and jeans but hide my armor.
---
Uh oh, YOU forgot your backup weapon, but I have mine because I'm not a garbage player. You die while you're in your pip boy menu. Advantage me, without any atom shop needed.
---
I don’t think the real Sheepsquatch has been activated to appear in the world yet.
---
When doing that Burrows quest there are holotapes putting the Pioneer Scouts into the story as the Sheepsquatch’s hunters so I think the earliest we will see the new cryptid is May 7th when (if it stays that way) we get the Ever Upwards questline
---
My camp is literally a bed and breakfast. There’s a reception room and two rooms for rent in the first building, they have the best views. The second building is a little one room cabin complete with fireplace, radio, and creepy trophy mounts. And my third building is the dining hall with my bed upstairs. Dining hall has the Red enamel stove, brew and fermenter, juke box two tables, radio and milk fridge. Second floor is my bed, 3 instruments, fire place to cozy up in and the lovely sounds of gunfire coming from white springs 
---
If you’re on Xbox one right now send me a message to come stop in. 
---
I would die for a guestbook for this camp setup it would be the best addition to date.
---
How about a roof variant?  Like just one.  Anything.
---
Still here.
---
You're awesome I jumped for almost an hour &amp; switched servers to give up &amp; do a trade then saw you on top of the car I knew it was a good sign! I was on the car across from you so my buddy could join also. Cheers👍🏻👍🏻
---
Oh nice, thank you! Adding that now!
---
I found the tourist at Colonel Kelly's Memorial. The tourist wasn't there the first two times but on the third server hop he was there. I hope this helps.
---
Awesome. Thanks man
---
 Will do
---
+karma thank you
---
Pete Hines did, specifically
---
Ve vill see if you change your tune vonce your veapon breaks on the queen
---
I've now heard several locations: The water park parking lot, Colonel Kelly memorial, right in front of the main building in Whitespring, and I found it (I have seen posted for a male corpse named Ansel, but I found a female, Ann) at the Phillipi Battle Cemetery.
---
I assume you're referring to Fortnite? The one with the giant player base that only got shat upon after it became a success, as opposed to 76 literally getting trashed on announcement for being online? Or are you merely ignoring the part where I said "a lot" not, "every"?
---
Thank you, for being exactly what can be expected from Reddit. Good job. Winner, winner, chicken dinner, and all that.
---
I don’t, because it’s no longer the same game as before. The original promise was for the adventure mode; now we got survivor, so.
---
Cheers mate, was just wondering so I know if they're just going to get more and more expensive or not
---
I guess Fallout Shelter is GotY material then? then again, it's common knowledge that mobile gachas exist for the sole purpose to making a quick million. companies don't even try to hide that fact.
---
but ok. keep advocating for the poor, poor multimillion company. other medias get a lot more flak for a lot less, but when it's videogames "the nerds are just entitled"
---
Ate you denying that with enough money someone can now completely avoid junk for repairs?
---
Nobody got screwed by Fallout 76 existing.
---
He is on a bench directly across from the memorial.
---
Yes, the Scrapping/Selling favorites "cancel" button is also a problem on PS4 as well -- Circle is 'go back' on any other dialog, however in this case has been swapped with X (typically the 'confirm' button). 
---
My first and fastest instinct when that popup shows is going to be "OOPS, GO BACK!"  and the item will be sold/scrapped.  (For PS4, please map the confirm button to SQUARE -- we would never unintentionally hit this button..)
---
I expect if PS4 and PC are both set up incorrectly -- XBOX is likely mapped the same as well..
---
I'm fine with power armor skins, and skins in general being in the shop. The only effect they have on gameplay is to maybe make people harder / easier to see (but you can already do that with certain outfits in game). Hell I'd like to see more of that.  It's a harmless way for them to make money, and I've been able to buy every skin I really wanted from atoms earned in game, and I don't even go for challenges.
---
I’m not hating? I’m pointing out as to why you’re wrong saying it’s broken. 
---
...’So much so that it's a waste of time to try and argue about the difference.’
---
Yet here you are...
---
It’s. Lacking. Features. 
---
If you buy a the new ps5 I guess that’s broken until the last ever patch, right?
---
Thanks for your opinions :)
---
Good part about this? I like the t45 and 51 look more than x01. So with the other skins coming I can keep 01 stats but not look bleh.
---
Go do it by legendary vendor see if you can get in
---
You mean this tiny community? Like the care about a bunch of angry kids on reddit.
---
The people who were expecting another story packed fun single player fallout entry did.
---
I’ve seen a few with “rentable” space; be that hotels, apartments or even shops, so some way to track that in game would be a nice addition!
---
Ah. I’m on PS4. My current camp build is agriculture-focused and looks like a total dump as I only go there to manufacture large amounts of adhesive/fertilizer and sleep. You wouldn’t want to visit it in its current state. It looks like it was cobbled together by a Jet-fiend going through withdrawal.
---
Put up my CAMP there so there’s a tinkerers bench for you all! Make sure you leave to a different server so others have a chance!
---
Holotapes revolving around the Burrows and the mini quest that came with it imply the Pioneer Scouts as the Sheepsquatch’s hunters so I think it’s another uncompletable challenge.
---
Soonest I think we’ll meet the Sheepsquatch in game is May 7th when they release the Ever Upwards questline that further introduces and explains the Pioneer Scouts
---
i agree it is really fun to play FO76, wanna go do some dungeons?
---
I actually got an AA broadsider the other day through a drop at Whitesprings.  With my perk build it looks semi decent in terms of dmg
---
This mode isn’t mandatory. You CHOOSE to play survival if that’s the kinda gameplay you want. PvP. If that’s not for you don’t play that difficulty.
---
Hahaha yea
---
I don't know about you guys, but I like doing the daily challenges, feels kind of like logging in and doing world/daily quests, I have so many atom points I don't think I'll ever need to actually buy them.
---
IKR. I don't care. I don't have a problem with equipment repairs. I won't buy any kits, whoop De Doo.
---
It really doesn't offer any advantage other than maybe I had to pick up a few more typewriter or desk fan. 
---
Get over the drama.
---
Tons of Brazilians and Chinese {can tell due to the hard R in their dialect and asking, lol}.
---
On that note, people using their mic is pretty rare as it is so I could have played with tons of others from various other countries and never knew it cause they never spoke back, just emoted.
---
If someone on PC needs him, I can wait for a moment, my ID is same, Hopeless_Ateist
---
Fashion finder is the gem. Bet it is swapping armor "outfits", including PA with a hotkey.
---
LoL has what, 150 champions to buy cosmetics for? LoL is *designed* around microtransactions. FO76 is designed around FO4.
---
Question, does this happen when you follow a team mate to a location? I use to have a similar issue. It was caused by fast traveling to a teammate before they finished their load. Now I ask if they are loaded in before traveling and have no issues any more.
---
I keep forgetting to check what it is, but I think the ammo weight is what's holding me back from using it more
---
Where is that?
---
This made me smile
---
Ok? So what? I still gave you a situation where I’m at an advantage because I have a repair kit. Therefore it’s an advantage.
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
No problem, glad you saw me!
---
Listen, we're only going to add cosmetic things to the atomic shop, but we really want to make more money from this cash cow disguised as a fallout game so how about you go fuck yourselves and buy these repair kits. Thanks, yours truly Bethesda.
---
still there??
---
Wavy Willard's parking lot
---
LoL we understand that our game is failing and that less than 39,000 people play out game but here’s a ban😘 xoxo Todd Howard
---
You still there
---
That's why you put it near an event or important  location.   I have mine in Berkeley which will be perfect when player vending comes out.
---
lol I have an Assaultron Head with the same rolls as the Medical Malpractice. Been waiting for this since it was datamined. Fastest atoms I will ever spend
---
Its also funny how none of the dailys today involve the camer but all last week there were at least 1-2.
---
Great so far ty! Bug where last player  speaking in mics name is stuck there after switching servers is back for me
---
You absolute mad genuis
---
Eventually they will just give you a level 50 character to start out with like in World of Warcraft.
---
Jtrag here, just added you 😊
---
I don't get that paranoid. I figure getting popped once is the price of taking workshops, though it rarely happens.
---
Nobody told them they were getting one, so they weren't screwed out of anything.
---
What is the tourist for?
---
Pan?
---
I actually invested in luck of the draw (fully perked at 3) and ran it a long time in my active build and then realized it wasn’t really needed so I used the 3 perk slots for something else.
---
Yes which could have even more skins than LoL. Do you realize how many skins they could pump out for settlements/CAMPS?!? Hell, why not make a skin to make the PC a ghoul? Or how about a Gen 2 Synth?
---
I have a great idea on how you guys could changes for the better. Change the number 50 to a hundred. 
---
Even better yet, allow us to share photos directly out to other sources and so this is an issue.
---
Most of us have external hard drives and stuff so how about you let us decide how many we want to store.
---
Because that works quite well. You can see how many replies they have given to demands for explanation.
---
I wouldn't say that I am wishing Bethesda would do away with allowing you to purchase atoms. I agree it's a beneficial revenue stream. I just think that being able to use - say 1000 caps gets you 500 atoms. Something like that. Reward users who play a lot?
---
No way that's true because games are constantly getting  larger with every update. GTA V got like 20gb bigger over its lifespan
---
Oh yes of course
---
Trying to figure out if you know what you are talking about in the comment i replied to. Because if you arent a lawyer then i dont think you can say things like that and really know the nuances
---
I always end up seeing those and mothmen around the boundaries at the northwest and northeast of map. Only other time was near the Charleston firehouse.
---
Hmm... could sound like they did add the safe camp function, but i am not going to test it, don't want any wanted status, lol
---
Right under the butterfly on the map in between those two circles towards the bottom. I wish I knew how to put pictures on here!
---
Honest opinion i bought one For aesthetics. Gunna find one Advanved just to have them. Plus i just got 80 atoms from crafting or building so much......for free. But id rather repair my stuff 200% anywho and use resources than that but its the convenience of it not P2W.
---
As a new player if your not into aesthetics and dont build that would be a good use of atoms right?! So you can focus your build towards Dmg and DR. And get free repairs "Technically" 
---
Thats not how i personally like to play but each to there own.
---
Aside from the clipping issues mentioned, I personally struggle to be immersed when I've got a 10kg weapon magically clinging to my back. 
---
Functional slings with realistic physics would be amazing, though. I'll probably be waiting a while for that to become the standard in games.
---
10:1 these will be locked until Legendary Players thing is introduced.
---
New Feature: Legendary Players – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Join my buddy bud online on a server with the tourist on wavy Willard’s GT flatterror48438
---
Well, what else are they gonna say? "Sorry, you pussies, get over it"? This is reddit, saying anything that's not positive is ludicrous.
---
No, I'm talking about LoL, Which is why I stated LoL. Fortnite is tiny compared to LoL money wise.
---
Not sure if we can tag devs in this? Would be nice if they could see it.
---
Thank you for the suggestion I’ll add it to my list.
---
Yes on pc and just a little addendum: I also got stuck at the terminal where you select the location to drop the nuke(after successfully launching it) in a 3rd person view so I had to leave the world after launching a nuke. LoL
---
queued up :) Thanks for sharing
---
&gt;Kids don’t play this game. The majority of the player base is old.
---
If that's true, why is it that every random invite I get is from kids who sound like they're 13 year olds?
---
The two circles you can see on the map. I'm sorry I'm not good at yes. Maybe Google it and you will be able to see it.
---
Helpful comment of the day^
---
Here's hoping for a big revolver buff.
---
Logic told them. Fallout 3 had a pairing of FNV and they heard fallout rumors so they assumed Fallout 4 would have a pair.
---
Since you replying/asking me not him, I was using / testing it to prove to him he was wrong.
---
Turned it off before I threw them. A good minute inbetween. Maybe some lagg could be an explanation.
---
Whats it even look like? [It's blank](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/570346839795040259/unknown.png) in Atomic shop forev'
---
Not really haha. You gave me a hypothetical where someone fucked up and was unprepared for combat. Might as well have said "we both showed up, but you forgot your bullets. Go!" lol
---
You're reaching, and you know you're reaching because you are starting from a conclusion, one formed by someone else that you simply read, and working backwards through the "logic." 
---
Very dishonest form of debate tbh. In the time it took you to go find and repair your weapon the other person could have 1) switched to another gun and killed you 2) switched to a melee weapon and killed you 3) Fled 4) Waiting for a bystander to kill you once they saw you go into your pip boy during combat. 
---
Its a quality of life item man, just accept it. Your vigilance is misplaced, and that is evidenced by the fact that you have to control all the variables of your already hypothetical scenario in order to illustrate your "point."
---
I definitely feel your pain, I did the imposter sheepsquatch event and when I finnaly earn my well deserved assaultron recall keycard and start the event IT LAGS ME OUT! it was basically a black loading screen. 1 1/2 hours work down the drain. :/
---
Wonder how many atoms these will cost.
---
Lol!! That's pretty awesome! Great pic
---
Oh, I did this like one time to see if it worked.
---
It did.
---
Mostly if I take a workshop in adventure I just treat the whole thing like I'm part of the top three in survival.
---
I stop back into the workshop occasionally to grab whatever resources i was gathering and pop back out.
---
For the most part, I've just accepted the inevitability of death.
---
I was the exact same with the Vault Suit and Brotherhood Officer Uniform. Armor is generally bulky and covers up under armor.
---
I thought I already heard someone mention that if you have a vending machine turned on you have a marker on the map
---
Any new mounted plans or side quests in files?
---
They only respond to things they already have on the way, or trying to fill a quota of responses. You can see them fill a wave of them in on a single day and then not do anything for a week. 
---
Shoutout to Kimmundi for being a genuinely good community person for DS3, cause I ain't seen one like that since.
---
Fireproof is also useful if you plan on doing pvp as some of them dudes use a tse
---
Wish I could find a camera so I could get yeeted
---
Would be funny if we dont get that challange for like a month.
---
Hmm, it might be your computer. Make sure all drivers are up-to-date. Also and this is the worst one, lower your graphics settings. If you're playing on wifi make sure the signal is strong. Check your internet speed using a speed test site. I thought no Google even has one if you just type it in.
---
Tyler Country fairgrounds. He's sitting in a chair watching a show.
---
I'm not buying them because I don't need them. These are not pay2win items. These are scam items for people that don't know how to play them game. Basically kids  with mommy and daddy's credit card.
---
Yep, and that's just it. We all know there's bugs, there's problems, and issues that need to be fixed. But QoL changes often fix those bugs which lay on the surface most users are likely to encounter. Looting is a primary function in the game, and we often have enough problems looting as it is (corpses vanishing, items changing upon viewing a corpse container, the infinite load circle). This just adds one more, and one people are very likely to encounter.
---
It seems like it should have been an easy one to knock out.
---
That's where I found mine too, good central location.
---
So you want everyone to sell to the same vendor at whitesprings?
---
Another thing that is strange, design-wise, is that your turrets don't attack the people contesting the workshop. They should straight-up tear into them as soon as contestation starts for they are marked enemies and technically the workshop is still yours until they take it.
---
Hot Take: Don't try to make money, gimmie!
---
Tried that. Wall exploded. Not sure what to do now.
---
To be fair they did get flak,not nearly as much but people used to get really angry about preorder bonuses. Especially whichever one gave the canteen, people were not happy about that since it made Survival way easier and it wasn't sold separately (until later)
---
I’ve only seen 2 in 700+
---
Yea I just saw an earlier post about it. Thanks!
---
F
---
That's not logic, that's half assed assuming a pattern with a history of 1 incident.
---
There are 7 of them. Take your pick.
---
Well... haha then you can’t loose caps aswell I think
---
Got to wavy Willards water park and the body of a tourist has a chance to spawn in the parking lot and a broken pro snap camera on his body
---
When I log on, I have to go run behind at tree just so I'm not trapped in my basement. I'm on PC.
---
Go fuck off and make a stand about something with meaning you whiny little cuck.
---
Bandolier applies to Cannonballs
---
78.3% of statistics are made up on-the-spot.
---
I'm not at phillipie smoke but she would be right there on the like first grave
---
For an item we can’t drop, stash or sell, it doesn’t seem right to add weight to it, especially when it reaches a point that punishes players for participating in the SBQ Event because pretty soon those players will become encumbered with them either refusing to use because of the controversy or having to repair so few times that they have more kits than they know to do with
---
Yeah...no...I'm gonna continue selling to the vendor nearest my camp.
---
Considering that fallout only had 1 main game prior to fallout 4 how do you want more incidents to be added in.
---
Agree completely, the tactical suit looks amazing but is ultimately useless to me as you can’t see it
---
So you say if they can stay alive on the event they don't deserve to have fun ?
---
had 2 people show up at my base and started descimating it while the other one kept doing finger guns at me. really pissed me off
---
Why get rid of that
---
Wasted on Nukashine is still broken for me.
---
Note - regular vendor locations still have mods and different inventory than at White Springs. Same caps though of course...
---
&gt; they will have to run gunsmith 5 
---
What other perks in intelligence are you using that require all these points? I've more than enough room for my full build including gunsmith 5. The only perk I take off and put back on is weapon artisan for when I repair.
---
&gt;. I'm sure everyone will be able to just farm stacks of those like they farm stacks of serum recipes she rarely drops too right?
---
With players that are utterly incompetent you can kill the queen insanely fast. I've been on a server where some group did all 3 silos at once but launched one nuke at a time to get 3 queen spawns. We killed her so fast I ended with 3 queen kills in under 30 minutes. 
---
It's really not some impossible task to farm the queen.
---
I wonder if this has anything to do with becoming a legendary survivor, which they talk about being able to do in future.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
They push so much that workshop pvp is working 'as intended' and yet there are a lot of these little oversights that make the whole experience just feel broken.
---
I love this game but they really needed to let it cook for another six months or so.
---
They also need to just stop using the players to playtest every patch that comes out and just have some kinda closed test servers to work out all these issues *before* they go live with them.
---
Ohh
---
No problem 👍🏼
---
All praise grandfather Nurgle!
---
The zoom function is a bit awkward for Xbox controllers but I like the idea of customizing it for my tastes.
---
They won't classify it as such.
---
Thus the shared world category came into play.
---
/u/Ladydevann can you let Bethesda know we do not want any repair kits in the Atom Shop? It’s a horrible idea and they should change it now.
---
Yes. If you want to keep it, craft or find a new torso!
---
Seems easier to just repair my own shit to 200%. Materials to do so are overflowing.
---
I'd say its probably more of a thing of convenience. The WS Station is closer to my camp, therefore lower fast travel cost. Watoga is a good spot to stop off and dump stuff after SBQ etc.
---
I still go to WS proper to sell though, mostly just to check the Artisan vendors (seem to be the dominant ones, stash box &amp; benches).
---
I was strictly speaking about farming caps and unloading junk all at once, not specialty stuff.
---
You now hold the rank of knight as bestowed upon you by your superiors at fort venture. Ad Victorium.
---
Maybe if WS was a free fast travel. All vendors have the same amount of 1400. I personally would rather go to the closest vendor to sell.
---
Or spawn inside your teammates concrete foundation and you have to fast travel again...lol
---
Fuck you're a whiny one...
---
Your own handmade. Shoot first like Han.
---
Appears to be solved according to Bethesda on 4/23. Awaiting additional player confirmations. Patch notes linked in the OP.
---
So you're only gonna get 200 per day. Cool. You do you, Mr. Wrong.
---
It is a robot and as such explodes upon death, which can cause it to fly away a little bit
---
I have a Bloodied explosive Assaultron head
---
or I can sell at a trainstation and not have to deal with a loading screen and that annoying music.
---
Super duper also works.
---
Honestly, repair kits do not level the playing field as much as people think.  Acquiring killer armor and weapons is the difference maker.  
---
When I face someone in survival I’m not thinking “oh shit I am screwed they have a repair kit.”  I’m really thinking “are they running cavalier assassins or sentinel assasins armor and fireproof 3.”
---
Just wanted to add that since many think it shares the same inventory as well which it doesn’t.
---
Got it, thank you!
---
Tse Combat Shotgun and Handmade with an instigating Fire axe.  Although my character is more of a trader than a fighter.  So that number reflects that playstyle most likely.
---
I will say that Valseek and ladydevann seem to comment the most
---
Well f me in the a, thanks for the heads up!
---
lol :)
---
Craft another torso and put it on a gram so it only weights 10lbs
---
It is wearing a blue shirt leaned against a car
---
All Vendors, not just Whitespring have a 1400 cap pool.
---
Hey dumbass, every vendor has a 1400 hundred cap limit. Not just those added to white springs
---
Someone's FedEx Todd some manila folders and paper. Tell him to weigh it.
---
"And not told us"
---
It was added in the last update along with another small side quest
---
You have to do it with another character apparently if you discovered it with that character on beta

gamma gun works nicely on a lot of pvp players, just saying ;)
---
Even those with ebay armor :)
---
Cant super duper Bulked items 
---
Other than that ... hmmm, ammo, armor, weapons, serums, fluxes, food and drink all work ... not sure whats left
---
Nope. But I am saying that if someone wants to spend $3 a pop to avoid playing the game... that's their choice. 
---
This isn't the Olympics, there's no medals. If someone wants to buy a game, then buy stuff to avoid, ya know,  playing the game that is about gathering junk to build stuff, just so they can... be awarded the junk they no longer need, by your logic... then, have at it, man. 
---
"Competitive advantage"... for what, exactly? Is there some sort of cash prize in this or something, that I don't know about? Scholarship to Fallout University? The location of the fountain of youth? Geezuz man, it's a fuckin' game. The only people tweaked about this are the ones who live and breathe in PvP, and treat it like it actually matters.
---
Like I said, if those players want to keep the servers running, while burning their paycheque on this shit? Good.
---
Bear Arms helps a lot, as does Ammo and armor weight cards. Sometimes I like blowing stuff up and sometimes I like sneaking around.
---
I covered how it mechanically changes this. The repair kits allow you to grind only for legendaries while others grind for repair mats.
---
I'm using a controller but didn't have time to play around, hopefully it's not something unusable.

You know, I don't think the repair kits were added for pay to win. They're pretty damn cheap. No, what I think they are is a much more sinister, thought out ploy to make money. They're easy to get thanks to in game atoms, and I'd bet my balls that they want people to use those free atoms to get them, so users feel like it's not so bad, they're not supporting the shady p2w. In reality they want players spending a little amount here and there, pretty consistently, so we wont have enough saved up to buy new cosmetics in the shop. I don't think it's a coincidence that we've been seeing much more impressive items in the shop, like raider excavator. They want us to spend the free atoms to boost sales of the other items, otherwise I can't understand why they pushed ahead with these relatively cheap and meaningless repair kits.
---
I used up ~3000 5.56 from my quad automatic handmade on her last time and it didn't break. Granted I shot at her in the air a lot so I maybe missed 300-500 of those
---
Exactly how is that someone paying to win over you?
---
I agree; release them as a craftable item that costs a fair amount in mats to do. Have it be scaled so you have a level 25 kit that does 75%, level 35 does 85%, etc. Similar to Stimpaks; diluted, normal, super. Make the plans something you discover from questing or repairing X amount of things outside your CAMP etc. 
---
Then you have created balance AND added a tactical element to drawn out combat that’s both interesting and rewarding. 
---
Having the same concept but bought with Atoms is inherently unbalanced as players who choose to spend real money to buy Atoms to buy repair kits will not have had to decide to allocate mats to repair kits over say, a weapon mod. Players who use Atoms they have got in-game also have to choose whether to buy that sick new armour skin, or a repair kit. 
---
It creates a tiered gaming structure;
---
- Tier 1
---
Happily pay real money for the item
---
- Tier 2
---
Strictly uses in-game generated Atoms, rarely purchases due to want to buy cosmetics 
---
- Tier 3
---
Refuses to endorse non-cosmetics even with in-game venerated Atoms 
---
Should Tier 1 players get in a PvP scrap with a Tier 3, if it drags on to the point where item durability becomes important the Tier 1 has the advantage. This type of mechanic unbalances PvP wherever it is found. Solo; adventure mode, not so bad, but any PvP interactions will be tainted. 
---
Ultimately it is lazy by Bethesda, they had the opportunity to add this item in an engaging way but opted to monetise it. Sadly I can see the same happening with fridges or cool boxes, for example. Fridges could be a quest; gather the bits, plans, and make a new junk item that’s harvested from something perilous and voila. 
---
Simple, rewarding, and effective. 
---
A QoL upgrade that you earn not one you buy.
---
I stopped playing out of protest
---
Can I politely ask a cheeky favour of those who have got there camera to hop server please? There's a bit of a queue forming. Thanks.
---
&gt;If you buy a the new ps5 I guess that’s broken until the last ever patch, right?
---
Not if it works as reasonably expected out of the box. Sorting by 'spoil' in the pip boy does not. I open that and think "oh cool, i'll easily be able to see which food is the most spoiled so I can use it before it turns to mush". Except it's pretty much the exact opposite, and there's really no benefit to sorting that way instead of straight alpha. Either way you pretty much have to scroll through the entire list examining the level of decomp until you find the items you actually want to eat. And who the fuck implements a sort option where you can't toggle ascending/descending? I've personally had to do that in software and it's NOT HARD.
---
I don't really know how to say all this a different way, but you just aren't getting something fundamental here.
---
Oh jeez. The rates would need to be much steeper. That means 1000 caps = $5. It would also allow players to circumvent purchasing atoms from BGS. If players would sell 25K caps for $125... even $100, they would, in a heartbeat.
---
That's the point. You are claiming that gamers had every right to expect 76 to be to 4 what NV was to 3, and that was logical because 3 and NV happened. A single occurrence does not make a pattern, so any such expectation was not logical.
---
I use energy heavy guns. What happens is you shoot a single bullet and the gun basically jams, forcing you to go through the long ass reload time *twice*, and it can jam again after the second reload.
---
If you play in a team they should hope they don't update it lol.  I used to have my base built on top of a satellite dish and if they fast traveled to me they would always spawn at the craziest spots.
---
That's just toxic and silly.
---
No i'm not saying that at all. I forgot to put this part in, at least have some high damage weapons like 200+ or maybe even 150+ if they're full auto
---
How do I repair it I got it from the guys but haven’t gotten a quest I read the note and licensed to the holo tap and still nothing can someone help me
---
The PS4 version runs horribly.  Pretty much unplayable at this point.
---
Just awkward, the trigger is used to use the camera but the bumper above the trigger is used to zoom. You get use to it.
---
Got 2, dunno what to do with them...
---
They have a weight of 0.1...
---
I think the whole complaint is childish and petty on the scale of it. The only thing that would really make me angry about the situation is if they up repair costs and nerf cards at a notable level. Because the current repair nerf was a general joke. Infact it seemed as a fair balance to make repairs feel any bit significant.  I have had my x-1 and leather armor for a month+ on my alt. Repaired my x-1 legs once and my leather set maybe once or twice at the cost of a 2-10 minute gather trip including load times.
---
There are also better repair kits made available in game. At the low rate they probably drop it'll be comparable to how often i really need to repair. The only people i can see buying these are low levels starting off before they get the right cards. Ballistic fiber and screws start pilling up once you get a set of repair cards. At this point id give them a little wiggle since the games probably doing well under par. But realistically if they did turn this game into some p2w they'd lose any real revenue there making from the people clinging on.
---
The game is already unbalanced due to the access of dupes and online purchases.  Some damn repair kit won’t matter.
---
It’s not really pay to win as it’s commonly defined, you have an alternative to a standard mechanic, but not really any advantage over the game as a whole or other players, Bethesda even mentioned that they’d adjust them if any sort of competitive advantages were to arise.
---
most people don't tend to bother destroying anything, they might blow up a door to get inside if they're looking to see if you are home but rarely do they stay just to destroy. Happened to me maybe twice since survival mode came out, the rest of the encounters were just people sneaking around in my camp trying to get inside or waiting for me to come out.  
---
Me personally if I see someone elses camp i just ignore  them unless the door is wide open and there's no turrets
---
I just discovered fix it good and weapon artisan and run all my gear at 200%
---
Personally, I hate this idea. The last thing I want to see is a bunch of vehicles zipping down the roads.  Nothing personal, just my opinion
---
Google "can i run it." system requirements is a great tio see whether your computer can run it by scanning your hardware!
---
Lol ok bud. You seem to want to have the last word so whatever. If you say it’s broken it’s broken, it’s not, but if it’ll stop your crying that’s what I’m willing to humour you with :)
---
Dammit man now that sucks. I haven't lost anything but mods but they were really good mods
---
Huh. I guess it's possible that they were crouched the whole time so they didn't show up, but that's still weird.
---
Move to new wall, try bigger gun?
---
&gt;But most interested in the walking pipboy wearing all the weapons.
---
probably weight reduction to all weapon ,would be nice if it was a fat 80% weight reduction for all weapons
---
As soon as I realized hat was what he meant, this post took on a whole new "I'm so smart, everyone else dumb" attitude in my eyes.
---
That wasn;t the point i was making. I am aware 1\* items can drop very often and I have infact had a multiple legendary drop before BUT the legendary items were not dupes and were both in the corpse. The point here is that I got two of the exact same 1\* item  and  one of the items was in the corpse and one was on the floor next to it that i picked up. This is odd because both one was on the floor and one was sin the corpse as well as the fact that I hadn't been able to loot legendary items that had dropped on the floor in the past. You could say RNG but this is definitely an abnormality. Obviously not an urgent problem or anything like that but it's clearly not supposed to happen.
---
If we're going to use logic here, if anything logic would have told anyone who cared to use it that 76 was a side title and not a main series title, because Bethesda loves using sequential numbers for main series titles and other names for side titles.
---
of all the posts here that are driving the point home, THIS Post drives it more home than any of them. You literally don’t need to grind for any items required to repair your gear. Just press a button. This is madness for real
---
Three years old with two posts and three comments, all on this sub and all within the past hour or so. This is either a shill or troll account, and should be treated as such.
---
haaaaahaha. That'll change my mind about the reactions being overly dramatic, for sure.
---
I've been playing vids since the early 70s. Yeah, I'm here to "badmouth the nerds". 
---
I don't "advocate" for anyone, but I'm not some angry little gamer that wishes this business was somehow different than every other business out there. Games aren't designed for you or I. They're designed to make money for companies and shareholders. Just like every other product ever made by every company ever...
---
… it's the notion that somehow this should be different than makes many  gamers earn the "entitled" tag.
---
Alcoholic drinks don’t work either (as far as I know).
---
gotta take me to dinner first :P
---
Whoa. Is that even a thing? Guess my ignorance is showing, I have never gotten over 4000 caps at a time... lol
---
I have a furious 3 star faster swing speed and 90 percent weight reduction this things weighs about as much as a bobby pin and attacks persecond wow. So I am stealth melee all five pieces of chameleon and ninga  perk max.  So three times attack from ninga plus another .5 for stealth blade mod gives you 3.5 this thing is a beast in whitespring   
---
the other day ran into Mirelurk queen and two kings 3 shots and she was dead bout 5 each for the kings.  Combat knife has to get repaired maybe once a week really is the best dps out there and cost very little to repair.  In fact if anyone wants to sell me a 3 star instigating  with swing speed and strength I am on it like a fat kid on cake.
---
&gt;What other perks in intelligence are you using that require all these points? I've more than enough room for my full build including gunsmith 5. The only perk I take off and put back on is weapon artisan for when I repair.
---
That is the point, they won't have to put 5 points into intelligence, because they won't need to run those skills. They will only need to run 3 max.
---
&gt;With players that are utterly incompetent you can kill the queen insanely fast. I've been on a server where some group did all 3 silos at once but launched one nuke at a time to get 3 queen spawns. We killed her so fast I ended with 3 queen kills in under 30 minutes. 
---
That doesn't change the fact that they said in the patches it would be a RARE drop form her, so think about how often the rare serums recipes drop off her, now realize that is how often the 1 use repair kits she has will drop. You aren't going to be having tons of those laying around.
---
We would need mods for that to happen, sadly that doesn't seem to be the case here.
---
And then convince the 90% of FO76 gamers that don't use reddit to quit playing as well.
---
Soooooo, authentic then!? 
---
It could be the books become something linked to the challenges? “Sign in to 76 CAMPs” and “Have 76 visitors at your CAMP”
---
The latter sure would help those wanting to be a retailer or bed to rent.
---
Thank you for the reply and not giving a false time frame!
---
There's some very curious unique looking briefcases all over Watoga, wonder if they're connected?
---
I'm sure I've lost more in the past but now I at least know exactly what was lost. I now log everything I store on my mule. Not that it matters because once it's gone, it's gone.
---
I wasn’t aware of that. Good to know!
---
Repair kits are definitely a first world problem
---
Most of the time when I have done it, they've been at the location for a few minutes.
---
I would have done that if I had the computer infront of me or the new parts installed. Thank you for the suggestion but I already knew about can i run it. I don't have access to that PC and this is mainly to see if it can run it BEFORE I invest in the parts
---
I feel like I have to buy that skin out of loyalty. But I'd never use it. I have the Hot Rodder skins (amazing when mixed and matched), but rarely use PA because I can carry significantly more without it. We need legendary power armour!
---
I know you might be speaking in hyperbole to make your point, but have you actually had guns break on you 'in a minute'?
---
My guess is that they are targeted towards more casual players. They are for the guy who only get to play an hour or 2 a day and doesn't want to spend it farming! I'm into other survival games and I noticed they are simplifying things to make the game more "casual".
---
The most they can repair your gear is by 150%, no normal person is going to take 150% over the 200% you can repair yourself. The repair kits literally aren't that much of an issue to get triggered over lol.
---
Yeah I mean tbh I’ve never had much of an issue repairing my guns on my own.
---
Any of these quest actually in game yet ? Or any new wall mount quests
---
I don't know if I have mistaken. Or you. I think I have, but I don't understand how it's first "we", then you switch into "I".
---
I'm not going to be able to provide anything better.
---
This should be an online petition
---
Bulk items, alcohol brewing, crafted mods. I know some quest items DO work with it
---
Bloatfly syringer.
---
Np, I also made another helmet with bright light since many times it’s literally too bright...lol
---
I decided to wait until they went live before I stopped playing. 
---
Today's the day!
---
Okay... Can anyone mod the SAH? Have one in inventory but can't mod it, it doesn't even show up in the list at the weapons bench (yes, I have it on me).
---
You cannot earn these multiple times on the same account, the challenge tracking goes across all characters
---
You PS4?
---
Beth: "Cameras have been delayed until a future patch"
---
*\*community rages\**
---
Beth: "Fine, here ya go, don't blame us for the repercussions, you wanted them now"
---
Exactly and people would expect a single player side title from a single player game development studio who even stated they were going to "save player one"
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
Except pvp will never be taken away from workshops because that is a basic function of them, accept it and move on.
---
Nope, and didn't look for wall mount quests.
---
Definitely! It’d be a lot of fun going camp-hunting to sign their guest books.
---
Dude...
---
I haven’t tried playing in about a month because even on my low-mid range PC, the game freezes and eats shit while I can play literally any other game without issues at max settings
---
Yes! Forgot to add. Will edit now thanks.
---
Maybe decreased/no AP cost for jumping? Might be good for marsupials.
---
read that someone else had the same problem with the HUD.
---
I have modded a stealthboy, clib shocks and sensor array today, worked just fine, could be just the HUD mod, maybe open a ticket so they know ?
---
It was fixed according to the patch notes.  Haven't  a chance to try it myself yet.
---
but p2w repair kits!!!!11!1!
---
Has anyone actually found one yet? I've checked them all and server hopped a few times. Nothing
---
The repair kits do not belong in the atom shop.
---
I've paid for in game stuff before in games but as long as the repair kits offer an advantage I will never pay money into the atom shop.
---
What is a ticket?
---
Now Bethesda is doing product placement? Microtransactions were bad enough
---
&gt; ebay armor
---
I laughed louder than I should have
---
Agreed but also workshops are a waste of time since you can farm more materials and not ore
---
It was. I was able to finally attach my flamer mod to my chainsaw.
---
If your already data mining want to ear some cash ?
---
So you don't buy stuff off r/market76 or any trade discords?
---
Lol I carry five weapons and visit my base every hour!
---
Dang, sorry man.
---
Is that after thru-hiker/traveling pharmacy? Or do those not affect em?
---
While I personally dislike turret camps at Whitesprings it is kinda funny how the playerbase decided that it is not ok with turrets-bases in this specific location, and then we expect the Developers, who are obviously ok with it, to enforce our personal preferences. 
---
The Developers have, to my personal knowledge, never said that it is not ok to camp there. Not sure why everyone expects them to "fix" this. Personally I would like to see the area around the clubhouse as a no-build zone, but I am very much aware that it is a preference and not a bug that needs fixing.
---
You still have starfield and es6 in 4-7 years, so relax.
---
Im glad you are having fun, and encourage you to continue doing so :)
---
&gt; Brawling armor mod (increased unarmed damage) does not increase unarmed damage
---
LOL, really? I had no idea about this... back to Ultra-Light, I guess. Thanks for sharing!
---
What would stop people from logging on and taking every workshop all day? And you have pacifist mode so you can’t accidentally activate pvp. Camp damage is being taken out. Don’t want to? Then don’t. you have the option to opt out.
---
So, combo perks for our legendary character prestige?
---
I've spent 3 minutes. I "heard" because friends of mine still playing told me about it. So yeah, my ears picked up on the sounds they were making.
---
OwO
---
Plans should go in a fike with a set weight of 1, every plan goes in the file as you wpild irl
---
no doubt about that.
---
It works, done a lot of mod's today on one of my X-01's, but a few users are saying they can't apply the X01 HUD mod...
---
&gt; Oh now **you** know lol. On **your** previous post **you** were guessing. 
---
\^ Swapped to "I" when it was directed at me.
---
&gt;It’s the millennials
---
Solid troll post but you jumped the shark with this line
---
8/10 good attempt
---
this is an issue that is very common in the burrows aswell, the moment the monsters death animation is done, the body vanishes and resets. It is very frequent with legendary mobs.
---
It's a misc item, and the only weight saving perk card i have is rank 1 in ammosmith.
---
I doubt it'll be affected by any perks.
---
Starfield is a shot in the dark and ES6 isn't my cup of tea. neither of them are linked to the fallout franchise which the fans of that series will have to wait much longer for a new title to drop. Fallout 76 was supposed to be a single player game to hold them over till then
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYpjy5Cv6E&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Yes.
---
And roof accessories.  Weathervanes, anyone? XD
---
Dropping junk is the primary death penalty in this game. How is avoiding that by paying money not pay to win in your eyes?
---
ohh... thanks for reminding me, have to go through my stash for the flamer mod, right now, lol
---
I thought Bethesda was just slapping me in the face, as a joke. Lol. I can't count how many times this happens.
---
More likely it gives an additional search for outfit items like Pharma Farma, Can Do, and Butcher's Bounty.
---
More of this if you want actual change. Gonna have to hit that active player count
---
Has anyone found it on PS4???
---
I’ve been server hoping for an hour and nothing!
---
I want this issue...
---
lol :D
---
The drop rates are the same, they just aren't being duped into oblivion so it seems like they are less common. Literally millions of TSE's flooded the market, made it seem like anyone who played for a week could have one.  Sadly, they could... At the height of the duping, you could buy one for 500 caps.
---
Those days are gone.
---
You should expect to play for hundreds upon hundreds of hours before getting a drop that rare. Multiple play throughs. Or possibly even never.
---
Agree. New companies with better practices will take its place
---
It is their choice now, after today. It wasn't in a legal manner yesterday. But it is now. That is the distinction.
---
Junk is supposed to be one of the rewards for a pvp victory. This enables removing that for money and changes the game.
---
Definitely submit a ticket. I'm sure they'll refund you.
---
People can finally take last pictures where they say goodbye to this game.
---
Thanks for responding.  I don't currently have video unfortunately.  I can only tell you that there was one time that I saw the sheepsquatch when it died, I saw the place where it fell to the ground and yet I looked all around that area and it didn't seem to be  there. 
---
On one occasion when it happened, we were able to loot a meat pile that looked like robot carcus but it had a legendary gear that was not unlike that found on the Sheepsquatch itself. And my knowledge neither I nor anyone else on my team had tagged any other legendary enemies.  I can't be certain, but it  almost seems as if the Sheepsquatch body was presenting itself as just  a pile of robot debris.  
---
But on other occasions, searching the robot meat piles turned up nothing. 
---
Other times the Sheepsquatch's body was easy to see because it looked unlike any other dead body in the area. I wish it was like that always because it would be easy to identify and loot.
---
Is there any briefcases in the game?
---
Yeah having the same problem
---
You absolutely need help!  I did it solo once but I was level 100 something, even then it took me about an hour while my newb buddy stood above ground waiting for me.  (He couldn't get in because he hadn't finished the main story)
---
Met ansle at Cornell Kelly's
---
When is the prestige thing supposed to be introduced?
---
Legend
---
Pack filler
---
&gt; **stuck** at the top/hot page
---
No idea I'm afraid. Just heard it's on its way.
---
One I know of that I don’t see on here is just south of the red rocket in the ash heap. The red rocket is a little west of the yellow truck on the map, the random encounter location is south of the RR in a clearing. I’ve encountered deathclaws, liberators, prize bot, and lemonade vendor there, just to name a few.
---
I found a new sheepsquatch quest too!!  At one of the train stations!
---
Some repairs are worth more than others. Someone with broken armor and no balllstic fiber is going to be worth more than someone who jist needs to repair an axe. The repair kit does not care what those mats are worth in game
---
Stash caps are like the last thing to load. Ill be playing the game for 5-10 mins before they show up. PC
---
Omg I could carry more than 2-4 guns at a time? I would do anything to have my weight in my stash increased and for my weapons to bot be 20 pounds.
---
+karma mvp!
---
Sad to see you go but I get it 100%
---
I got a quad single action lol I have to load 32 bullets.... thank god for realism cough cough
---
Like the 4 of them that were broken last week? Or how about the broken ones from the brewing patch?
---
what scales the health of the SBQ? The number of player in the area at start of the event or does it scales dynamic? 
---
For me its ok to play this event with low levels as long as they helping ie with clearing the back of the high levels.
---
What i dont like: Players who hits the SBQ one or two times and then hide until the end. No matter what level they are...
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
I thought the destroying camp was encouraged (or at least permitted) with the Wrecking ball perk...
---
Or we just don't like the anti-consumer road that Bethesda seems to be happily driving down but I guess that's just being spoiled.
---
I don't care what you think. I'm just pointing out that you're wrong. Fallout Shelter ***is*** a low quality game made for the sole purpose of generating revenue, or as mobile gachas are known, a *cashgrab*. and some countries are even debating about their legality, that's how bad they are.
---
and false advertisement is another very serious issue. Fo76 was sold on the promise that there would be no p2w. yet they hired experts on monetization. in case you didn't know, there's a fine line between profits and anti-consumerism.
---
&gt;I've been playing vids since the early 70s. Yeah, I'm here to "badmouth the nerds".
---
&gt;I'm not some angry little gamer
---
I could swear you were since that's somewhat demeaning. especially considering any other type of consumer wouldn't stand for practices such as this. films, music. like I said everyone else gets flak for messing up, but not videogame companies.
---
A pissed off, irradiated bear would be scary.
---
Are you still there?
---
But his promises made to the public are still in bad taste if he had no idea what he was talking about. If the descision wasnt set in atone he shouldnt have shot his mouth off.
---
I am guessing it’s a ping for outfits like you get for magazines, bobble heads, and cap stashes.
---
Not really, I don't actually scream and yell lol. Its more like "bro wtf are you doing" then I explain and if they still don't leave and continue to hide in the bunker I keep on them about it, eventually they feel like big enough assholes and leave.
---
I think we must do workshops the same then.
---
Technical data is kinda meh...... Hopefully it's a new data for perk cards or something cool?
---
[PS4] W: Bulk Rubber and Plastic H: Caps
---
See, you.used that word "supposed to", but you were never promised a single player fallout game after 4 and it was never hinted at by Bethesda. Again, that's the half assed assumption and the sense of entitlement that you were "supposed to" get a specific game.
---
Dumb question - how do you know what the award for the challenge is?
---
your hands get rattly and you can't aim as well
---
Ok I'll add you and join!
---
You obviously haven't had to jump out of power armor to use a repair bench in the middle of a nuke zone to fix your weapons during a queen fight.
---
shaky hands cause bullets to miss
---
The vertibot at the munitions factory counts, i had to go to the front of it though for it to register
---
Yea it sucks especially when you got good but ugly armor.
---
My thought exactly.
---
Hemlock Holes is pretty good. Three acid nodes and close proximity to acid dropping enemies like the Grafton monster and snallygasters.
---
You essentially get enough acid to smelt 150 steel or lead every 40 minutes or so. Plus super duper can just make you more. Its size and layout also makes it my favorite PVP workshop.
---
Well the assumption came from and I quote once again "save player one" that Bethesda game studios themselves backed. Sorry if I expected BGS to stick to their word.
---
Unfortunately I didn’t play in the beta
---
The Appalachian Cooking Blog, now in hard copy.
---
dupers will literally create money (cola) out of thin air with their buddies
---
Brought by all characters ty so much!
---
I hear regular stories like this of people accidentally buying an item, being refunded and keeping the item (I wonder if that's because they actually can't remove ownership...).
---
They should do something aboot this. Item trials perhaps? There's been a few things I've bought but don't like because the screenshots provided were inadequate and only by trying the item could I determine whether I made the right choice.
---
I spent four days pondering whether to buy the poodle dress. I wasn't certain I would like the glasses. Bought it and slightly regretted it, they are very, very pink... Even at night. They've grown on me, though.
---
I can see it giving an advantage in survival mode. We all know where the work benches are in the game, where people need to go to make repairs. So being able to repair your stuff while hiding in a portapotty allows you to avoid known workbenches. 
---
I don't PVP or play on survival so I can't say how big an advantage this really is... but there you go.
---
I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and just not play anymore. Already uninstalled when this was announced, while tentatively waiting to see how it played out.
---
I've seen to many games slide down the p2w slope to a sad demise, I'm going to not go through that frustration for a change and get out now. I've had my money's worth.
---
Fair enough
---
Who is spending $20 on one fake outfit from the Shitomic Shop?
---
I don’t think you can just do this over and over though. They told me that my situation was a one-time courtesy.
---
Sure, as long as it's nothing illegal.
---
Picked up a fatman mirv mod for last weeks, haven't tried to put it on yet. I think the mod thing is fixed now but didn't read anything about losing ammo bug on logout/in. This one sounds easy!

The game is glitched, if you have a weapon favorited when it breaks and you click it, you can use that gun infinitely till you switch weapons. EVer since learning this and knowing a repair bench is just north of the fight and usually out of harms way, I don't complain much. Not really winning anything in a single player game though and if you get in like 5 shots then you get a reward. But I have and it's annoying.
---
And when it all comes down to it, while these things that they're "fixing" (weapon/armor repair, food spoilage, stash locations) might make the game slightly more boring... I thought people wanted a survival rpg/shooter/whatever fallout is? Taking these elements out means you're not really surviving in a wasteland. People can't take 5 minutes out of relentlessly grinding for legendaries to travel to a workbench/train station? Do they even enjoy the game?
---
Especially since it's not too "on the fly" anyways. You have to go into your menu, select the item, then repair it from there. By the time I did that in the field, I'd be dead. So I just carry multiple weapons. Waaaaay easier.
---
If anything in pvp you would die trying to use it.
---
No you have to have the best effect you gotta lower that player count.
---
I saw haha no problem
---
The patch notes state:  
---
* **Mods:** Found Mods can now be correctly applied to Power Armor and weapons.
---
That would be awesome and really start to help drive the whole “players become the NPC’s” kind of vibe they were shooting for
---
If you're out of ballistic fiber, you're a low level without white knight or fix it good. It's pretty hard to miss, I never make any trips to the "farming" spots but still have enough to repair my (extremely low hp) legendary leather limbs
---
I wont buy them because there's no benefit.... There isn't a single aspect of P2W Here.  This is also not even close to a p2w gateway.  They are a gimmick to me considering the perk cards so if people want to buy them then let them, fuck you can earn loads of atoms for free it's not even all real Cash... Plus what's wrong with supporting the developers if you like/enjoy the game and want it to progress further with better content? Money talks if that's what you want.  We all know sales will not be great for this as we all know the game and how to 200% repair with ease (hopefully.)  They know or should know cosmetics will by far outweigh sales and bring in more revenue, especially CAMP, power armor and  gun skins.  There's no problem here it;s a simple option, are you lazy or not? if so just go waste money if not just change a few perks for one minute.  Don't have the materials? Good job you can easy buy them on reddit for caps ( of which there is an abundance) and in future player vending.  People need to chill TF out, seriously.
---
Oh ok thanks for explaining
---
Yeah it's understandable if they just hide in the bunker and do nothing low level or high level. But if they're legitimately trying to help I don't see why they shouldn't be there. I was leveling a lower character wasn't doing much damage but I was spamming cryo nades and pumpkin nades so I was somewhat useful.
---
I've always wanted one of those. Shoot until things die, then spend the time between this and your next fight reloading

I've never started. It's too expensive for me to care.
---
lmao anyone who bought this scam of a game literally played themselves with the most obvious bamboozle of 2018. 
---
I still can't quite grasp how people first buy into this obvious scam and then complain about being scammed. It has to take the cake for lack of self-awarness.
---
That's not too bad then. .1 in my stash, I'll probably save these up until player vending
---
It's one where you really need a group of four people working together and coordinating their efforts. Possibly sharing costumes.
---
That explains both why we get free atoms and there’s SFA to spend them on. \*nod\*
---
Its a new glitch if you emote at all and while using the camera it launches yoh
---
it's not the handmade, it's vats and crits. and any auto weapon works great wth vats, *particularly the handmade*.
---
and it's a good thing they exist, otherwise assassin/sentinel would go unchecked.
---
Noticed it as well.  It never used to do this for me on PS4 so I feel like something has changed.  Happens a lot of Poseidon.
---
just found one at the graveyard place nearby, she was leaned up against a wall, blue nuka top, very tricky to spot if your not looking for her
---
Still though. Why add them? It just cheapens the game. Now some rich people will never have to worry about repairing. Sure it's not a big deal, but it is unfair to everyone who bought the game expecting a fully balanced experienced after the $60 purchase price.
---
People are missing the point. This doesn't ruin the game(though it's not a great game already) it just further degrades trust in Bethesda.
---
Been looking for an hour. Thanks
---
Same here I was waiting to place beer bottle all over my bar

&gt;Like Basic Repair Kits, Improved Kits cannot be dropped, crafted, traded, or sold, and do not use any of your crafting materials when consumed.

From the patch notes...

video game mechanics!

the same way that being a commando or gunslinger raises the damage of those same weapons I guess
---
This. The effects of broken promises escape the scope of fo76. It will be felt by bethesda games of the future if they continue to do things like this.

Oh, I don't doubt it. But all of them tend to reply to less inflammatory stuff/times, and very rarely do I see them answer a summons.

I feel like I'm going to need that long to get into a situation where a cargobot is low enough to the ground to snap a photo of it and have it *count* towards the "photograph robots" challenge. I took like 20 photos of one just now, but it was always too high in the air to register.
---
This is a subreddit dedicated to a video game, you could use that line on literally every post ever made here.
---
I currently have the theory that if NPCs are introduced with the Wastelanders DLC that 
---
1. There will be faction HQs that emerge as locations in the “out of bounds” outskirts of the map (Responders Shanty Town across the river west of Vault 76, Free States in an abandoned facility, BOS in some secret government underground train station, Enclave clearly has the Whitesprings Bunker) 
---
2. Depending on which faction you choose to align with there would be certain benefits (Responders can afford to give you free ammo stacks once a day, Free States would offer free Chems once a day, BOS could allow one free fast travel a day or reduced fast travel costs but all HQs allow free fast travel like CAMPs do)
---
3. Faction related dailies and events. (Kill X amount of “abominations” for a chance to earn a Battlecoat or 1-3* +15% damage to the daily related enemy from the BOS, create x amount of Chems/heal x amount of players for a chance to earn 1-3*Vampire’s/Regenerating weapons/armor or a unique scientist outfit. Rescue wastelanders for a chance to earn 1-3* Anti-Armor/fitting legendary armor effect for weapons/armor or a unique ranger themed Responder Outfit from the responders).
---
Events like “Defend the Gates to Faction HQ”/“Collect Resources at Location for Faction” “Attack/Defend Faction Nemesis/Allies” (Can open up to a PvP team deathmatch style event in survival)
---
4. The bare minimum of the above mentioned and all related “NPCs” are robots of once human characters that make the game feel only a little less empty that what the above mentioned can bring and shallows on the questline we expect big things from being “the biggest and most ambitious DLC”
---
Scrap 20 ranged weapons, scrap 20 melee weapons, craft 40 energy ammo, craft 40 explosive ammo, craft 40 molotov grenades. (Super duper and ammosmith don't count towards these)
---
Reward is a 50 cal MG w/ two shot, +25% fire rate, and +15% reload speed.
---
Np dude...I saw you added me lol
---
I just hole they add wall choices to the shop. Would love to see those
---
Actually, \[ and \] would put the plans at or near the bottom of the list since most item names are capitalized. Square brackets come between uppercase and lowercase letters. Parentheses, ( and ), which were used, come before uppercase and numbers. And curly brackets, { and }, are after lowercase letters.
---
Underscore/"low line" \_ is grouped with \[ \], which is why it didn't work when trying to rename my PA Chassis to get them to the top. Using a period/"full stop" . works for renaming Weapons and Armors to get them to the top.
---
The only reason I'm replying to this 8 days later is because it's obvious how they could "fix" putting {Known} Plans at the bottom at times with an additional Sort option and making sure (Known) Plans are at the top with another Sort option without having to do something silly like reverse alphabetical.
---
And they still haven't made it consistent whether to include the (Known) as part of the sorting or not. If viewing a vendor or other player's notes with a trade screen, it's not respected. When interacting with stash, it's not respected. Only when viewing Notes in the Pip Boy is the ( part of the sorting. That's basically the opposite of how it should be utilized.
---
The only times the sorting is convenient and helpful is when either mass eating plans or when dropping plans to lose weight.
---
You stand still to fumble around, you are dead. I don't see these working well in PVP and its not like the fight is going to last that long anyways to the point your gun is pooping out on you.

Ahh, yeah, if I recall properly TSE east durability still. That would explain a bit.

It crashes every single time I play. It really stinks. Wish I could get a freaking refund.
---
Go to Wes Tek Research to the right of whitesprings on the map near bunker alpha
---
Right? I've learned to pull off nerd rage instead of gunsmith when I'm putting on my repair perk. Too many times I've had weapons break unexpectedly because I forgot to switch back. 
---
Learning which perks to switch out is the real endgame challenge.
---
300 hours on pc and about 200+ on PS4 I don’t think I’m eligible for any type of refund or sympathy.
---
They were really careful about how they did the repair kits.  They are in no way an advantage, and anyone who plays the game often enough would be able to buy them without spending real money. This isnt P2W at all, if anything its giving players who dont want any of the cosmetics something to spend their atoms on. I really dont understand the uproar.
---
I'd give you gold but you damn Raiders already took all my gold!
---
Because people with money don't have to worry about an aspect of the game that helps you win now. Definition of pay to win. Even if it is minor.
---
How many free atoms have you gotten once you got though the 1 off challenges. At most I see around 50 a day with dailies. So an 800 3 day limited time item is impossible with those "free atoms". Now their going to start tossing in pay 2 win items. I haven't seen the price of repair kits but I doubt their cheap. Sure you can try for a repair kit once every few days while the guys who buy have 100 they can use daily. But yeah "free atoms" *nods*

Not playing is always the most powerful message. If they can see the game dying they either reverse course or let it happen. So the people who really dont want repair kits would be best served by not playing in protest. Uninstall so that we dont deal with this garbage in starfield and ES6 tol for those that choose to buy.

Papa nurgle thanks you for your service.

The Briefcase Bloodhound perk could be like the Pannapictagraphist or Fortune Finder perks, but for a new type of collectible they haven't added to the game yet.

---
Bethesda never promised to only make single player games. In case you still don't understand the point I have repeatedly tried to get across to you, here it is out bluntly: You are owed nothing by Bethesda. They made no promises to you about whether a game would be single player or multiplayer, they made no promises to you that a specific title would be the game you expected and asked for. Any such belief on your part is simply ignorant entitlement. Any such belief that because Bethesda has done X in the past means you can logically expect Y to follow is just dumb.

I've also tried contacting Bethesda through social media and no reply. God knows there is no way to contact them elsewhere. I guess they got big enough of a company that customer service is no longer a factor in their eyes.

Source or gtfo

Definetly mb lolz
---
Exploits (and what you are describing is an exploit) do not really make this any better in my opinion.
---
Unfortunately their idea is to add those convenient items and slowly make it inconvenient not to have them. Anyone who thinks they wont do that is way too trusting of a company that is out to make money won't do the thing that will make them money.

---
Lol this is such a stretch. How often are you repairing weapons mid fight? If you are thats poor management on your part. The whole perk card thing is a huge stretch too. Do you really think someone is going to let their weapons degrade faster and just spend money to fix it? Grinding for atom points is more tedious then scavenging for scrap. This is no way what so ever P2W.
---
"We read all your feedback and concerns but we're doing it anyway."
---
I was level 35 when i cleared my first silo, trust me there’s no shame in asking for help

Bethesda softworks publishes. I am not talking about Bethesda softworks I am talking about Bethesda GAME STUDIOS the makers of fallout and elder scrolls series.
---
Not really but it is an option. Also there is not only a work bench for weapons but also an armor repair station nearby too. Most now drop the nukes away from key fast travel spots anyways so this would mean would you spend atoms or hold E to get a little but of radiation that can go away but atoms being a finite free resource till you gotta buy things
---
You;re 100% correct sir, but I still don;t oppose them neither will I use them . They are a simple option for less knowledgeable players I am guessing.  There isn't a single aspect of P2W which is great and again 100% optional and if anything I consider it P2L because if you are going to use or depend on these you;re taking the biggest L.  I'm sure sales will reflect what we really want, EPIC skins.
---
*Mr. Krabs has entered the chat*
---
Yes. And use fuel to power it up.
---
Yeah this is unrepairable damage to the reputation of the company at this point. They had no business attempting an online multiplayer game.
---
More in-game cosmetics like this would be amazing. I want to discover/earn items, not purchase them. I think the Mothman PA skin would’ve been an amazing rare drop for an event set in or near Point Pleasant.
---
What one ??????
---
Very nice Star Wars reference. Just vague enough that plenty would miss it.
---
Ok, sure. Shift the goal posts when presented with your own evidence (Save Player 1) that disproves your own claim. We're done here.
---
Exp bonuses tied to cash purchases isnt pay to win?
---
If the game requires the revenue that this would bring in to stay profitable and continue to produce then it is both a complete failure and a joke.
---
Save player 1 was pushed by BGS not Bethesda softworks. I can tell we are done because your points are equaling to nothing and you are just getting angrier and angrier thus proving you are losing and getting desperate.
---
Which is why I tried to get people to not give ea money cause I knew other companies would watch and follow suit if it worked. Instead gamers would tell me that they weren't going to miss out on games, I was foolish cause I would miss out on games, and then continue to bitch about companies doing this shit. Well, guess what? It didn't lose them much money and it made a ton so other companies followed suit. Bethesda is one of the last holdouts of the more known developers but they are definitely chasing that money too

Bethesda is involved in that game, right? I’m assuming as it’s Elder Scrolls they have some involvement &amp; that game literally has a paid subscription package that basically gives you all the freedom &amp; clears up all the complaints people who don’t pay for it give. It’s sad but I think that might be what this game comes to eventually.

It's not a stretch, it's factual changes to game mechanics and the way they change player behavior. Whether you choose to min/max your time around the repair kit meta or not is irrelevant. The point is it removes the need for those perk cards if you throw repair kits at your stuff. That's the new game mechanic option. The practical approach on whether you decide to do this or not is irrelevant to the fact that it changed things.

How did you trigger the quests?

Canadian here. You'd be surprised how many Americans I encounter in the game. Apparently the Fallout franchise has a pretty strong following down south of the border?
---
It is an advantage. If you have irl money you can repair anywhere at the punch of a card. Thats an advantage vs people who dont have the disposable income to purchase as freely. If they were tied to caps and not atoms none of this would be happening. But then no revenue
---
Appreciate it.  I personally don't understand how people are ok with it... but to each their own.   Is it gamebreaking,  no..  is it something thats optimal for players to do?  maybe not...  But it's absolutely breaking from cosmetic only, into what I regard, P2W.  I'm not flat out against microtransactions,  i'm playing blades ffs F2P in spare time,  but it doesn't belong in a full priced game.   I've already uninstalled till something changes.
---
a three star furious combat blade with swing speed and the stealth modifier is a beast, I one shot every ghoul in white spring you and f up bosses in seconds I three shotted a Mirelurk queen also added bonus the weapon degrades super slowly I over repair for added dmg and consider this with ninja and stealth modifier you are attacking at 3.5 and you can get in three stabs in a sec.   Over look combat knifes at your peril trust me these are some of the best weapons in the game for a stealth build.

Disney theme parks sell express passes that let you skip lines at the amusements. There are those who say "so what it doesn't impact my theme park experience"

The seat you'd be in is given to someone who paid more, so you wait longer. That means you get to do less during your stay. Yes, it  absolutely does impact you.

it's in lewisberg, you can pick up the first quest from the "sheepsquatch ate my brother" poster in the atom shop or at any train station. the lewisberg station is actually right down the street from the office.
---
Get downvoted for being right scrub. A repair kit is effectively a microtransaction for the mats to repair whatever gear you want. Thats what you are effectively paying for. THE MATS. It IS p2w.
---
&gt;Anyone else that wish they could get there money back since it is going to be pay to win now?
---
I've played the game for over 700 hours and always enjoyed it. I'll continue to do so. Repair kits won't ever impact my gameplay experience either positively or negatively in any way shape or form.

Nope, You keep the player count the same and completely stop buying things on the ATOM shop and they will see that it is a boycott and not just people uninstalling due to being tired of the bugs.
---
lmao wtf are you on about? punishing for new players? this did absolutely nothing to the balance we had before. new players have the exact same opportunities you did while leveling up, only difference is they can now pay 50 atoms or something to fix their armor. unless they are already high level, the armor won't even need ballistic fiber to repair. if they are high level, it shouldn't be an issue to get it
---
Definitely exciting. Always would've appreciated a one and I think the hack and briefcase can reopen previously used locations for new quests and events.

There’s an alien hiding in the bed of a truck near Bend tunnel.  I’ll post exact location when I get back on but there’s a video/photo of it somewhere!

Seen a little not at Grafton but no mission ...
---
I’m personally getting sick and tired of having items simply disappear from my player character. 3 separate instances in the last 2 weeks I’ve had legendary weapons that I use regularly just disappear from my inventory. This is beyond frustrating. And I’ve seen other users with this complaint so it isn’t just me. I’m about ready to give up on the game, and this saddens me because despite all the bugs and the General lack of quality content, I’ve got many hours of enjoyment in Appalachia.
---
Because it opens the door to implementing actual pay to win elements.
---
Furious is better for rapid fire automatic weapons no? Where you can hit more times to increase the damage?
---
You should not be able to buy anything that grants any sort of comfort or gameplay advantage over another player who cant purchase. Weather or not its worth it to spend irl money on video game pixels or how ecpnomical it is withstanding. You buy an advantage.

There's wall mounted turrets on those relay towers. You know, the ones where you can get a supply drop with those US government supply requisitions.

That one is a little too bright and doesn't really fit the style of my build. I'm looking for lamps that can be placed on top of something. The problem is that most of them seem to not really shed enough light, at least the ones I currently have.
---
Omg, when did they nix serum recipes dropping from the queen? In the April 23 patch, or earlier?
---
I am pretty sure that we will get a marker, and this is also why they are planning to add the "pacifist camp" mechanic in that very patch too.
---
Cargo and vertibots haven't counted as robots for previous challenges. Protectrons, eyebots, securitrons, assaultrons, and infiltrators have. Not sure about Robobrains.

&gt;Repair kit meta
---
What? Dude, you are trying so hard to be mad about the repair kits. First off, there are already plenty of players who dont bother with the weapon condition perks because its already easy to repair weapons and theyd rather use the points for another perk. The practical approach does matter. If it isnt a practical method then why gripe about it? The bottom line is that if you are in any way a competent player then another player having repair kits will not give them an advantage.
---
Patch 8
---
Youre just wrong sir. Im sorry have a good day.
---
The drill/syringer issue baffles me too (also a software engineer). If a ticket like "remove flare guns from legendary loot table" ever came across my desk, I'd fix it, then wonder if there's anything else odd in the loot table. I'd see drills and syringers and ask if those should be removed too.
---
I can't imagine the work environment where a developer either didn't have the time or wasn't allowed to make those fixes.
---
I wasn't really planning on it, but now I am going to buy some because you are being a dick about it here.
---
Yassss please I have so many heavy guns lol. But I must carry them all
---
I'll happily explain!  
---
You see prior to the Repair Kits,   everything in the Atom Store was cosmetic items only. Part of the reason it has stayed this way is because Bethesda has copped major scrutiny since launch for potentially forming a Pay-To-Win (P2W) Game.
---
Now these Repair Kits may not hold a significant advantage, but it is undeniable that they can be a shortcut to gathering materials: Which is an advantage.
---
You may wonder what the big deal is. The big deal is that if this has profitable results for Bethesda, we will see more advantage items added for time to come. In most instances when this happens to a franchise, it starts small but then the advantage, and price tag increases.
---
This is a common but unethical business practice. It has been seen on older games like runescape, WoW and Habbo Hotel. However has had a strong emergence in newer games such as GTA Online, TF2 and Fortnite.
---
Ultimately the people who lose are the players who enjoy the competition and achieved progress through *playing the game*.   
---
This type of market strategy benefits:   
---
1. The Franchise owner (Bethesda)
---
2. The people who would like to enjoy the rewards of the game, with out spending much time on it.
---
As for everyone else, they can enjoy it before the rich kids come along.
---
Still have Marine Arms and Deep pocket for them?  Interested in those for sure.

I meant for repairing random crap that I'll be selling. At the moment I just immediately sell it to a vendor

I have another bug if you don't mind adding it to the list:

I found Anne at the Mothman statue after checking a dozen or so other places.
---
Wonder what decides if it's Anne or Ansel.
---
No you can buy it in the Atom shop. Of course it doesn't seem to work.
---
It pulled mine out of my stash for a minute to test it......I quickly remembered why it was in my stash.
---
It seems like since Bethesda has such a boner for the Handmade that they would sell skins for the Handmade or one of the other few weapons that people actually use in the game.

The idea is we want to keep photos and not delete them.
---
Not a sir, a woman that worked in game development for midway years ago. I know exactly what I am talking about. They will use any excuse they can to defend the repair kits, so if they see a sharp decline in atom shop purchases and a decline in players they will just lump the two together as "oh well they got sick of the bugs", but if you completely cut off using the ATOM shop while maintaining player counts then they will KNOW people are actively going out of their way to avoid the ATOM shop.
---
Found mine the other night there too.
---
Yes! It’s about player choice. - EA probably
---
Hello I might have what you are looking for
---
It's still non-cosmetic though. They straight up lied to us.
---
As you're levelling up wait until every 5th level to assign perk cards. This lets you open a perk pack so that the chances of you getting duplicates is decreased
---
There's a typo in one of Scoot's notes in his shack when you investigate what happened to him.
---
i agree with consolidating, even non damage perk cards depending, imo they could throw everything under bear arms, or like you said drop rifleman/commando and just make 3 general rifle cards
---
Not THAT dedicated to the meme
---
can you send me a screenshot too? ^~^
---
Sorry, it's less of a booth and more of a small area with a tripod and a backdrop of the name of the place
---
Beginning to think I should take the AAE Pump that was offered... Part of me also believes it may get more valuable as time goes on, who can tell with this game?
---
Really awesome. I really want that update that will let us set up vending at our camps as opposed to doing it player-to-player. Would be nice to set up a fertilizer, bulk item, and adhesive shop.
---
&gt; The only way how they could make repair kits relevant would be by removing workbenches from the world
---
Please don't give them any ideas...
---
You say potato, i say potato.
---
is there any other way to use a bow? (except flaming, lets be honest flaming arrows are pretty badass)
---
Well this confirms what I hoped wouldn't be the case... Looks like I won't be using the camera much either, I like all 50 of my saved images, they are a nice timeline of progress/changes with my player since the beginning.
---
Saame problem already notified bethesda.  Same old same old. We are looking into it.  I haven't found anything else yet that affects the X-01 armor.
---
These being in the atom shop does not make the game p2w.  You can get better repair kits by farming the queen.  If you really do want the item shop repair kits, you can easily use the free atoms you get every day for dailies.
---
Yeah, being able to pay 50 atoms to fix something you would have otherwise had to go collect or trade for absolutely affects the balance.
---
375 without any perks or charisma
---
Mate I've been suspended for 2 months when all it would take to fix the problem is 1 human to look at it. They don't care.
---
I would absolutely spend on some actual post apocalyptic or sci fi skins or costumes. I’m sick and tired of these clean and normal looking outfits, and silly looking masks/costumes. Give me some stuff that looks like it belongs in the world we are running around in!  Why can’t we get some NCR gear?!? Or some raider outfits??  Or some intimidating/frightening getups that look pieces together from apocalyptic junk???
---
Rad idea. I try to keep my CAMPs really RP-friendly, and it would be great to have that sense of indirect interaction, knowing that someone stopped by my CAMP and appreciated it. I'd sign other players' guestbooks as well. It would mesh well with the player vending machines we'll eventually get.
---
I need more time 😭
---
i can make you one too, if you can't hook up with him
---
The repair kits are inexcusable. No consumer should buy a product from a company that treats them this way. The bugs are their own separate issue that will never be fully dealt with. My point of view is why play this buggy newly made p2w mess when you could go play a polished gaming experience, or a fun indie game that doesnt want to milk you for money. I dont care if bethesda changes their ways at all but ill keep up and see if their next games are any good as always. But view of them as a company is forver altered.
---
Pistol perk? Paddle ball build, here i come!
---
I can see where a lot of people are coming from, but at the same time it seems like a non-issue.
---
People say it gives a competitive edge in PVP, but a smart, aggressive player will make sure their weapons are in good condition *before* engaging another player. A dumb, aggressive player will engage, break their weapon, and then spend several seconds navigating their menus to repair the weapon. And while they are doing that the person they attacked is going to have those several seconds to either retreat or pour in as much damage as they can.
---
Furthermore, a smart, aggressive player will have set up an optimized build that can kill you up in only a few hits, circumventing the need for repair kits because those few hits won’t degrade the weapon any noticeable amount, and a dumb, aggressive player will just use whatever, meaning a low damage output and chance of stuff breaking.
---
Wow nice find.
---
Man there are so many other things they could have done to make money that would have made people happy, but this is the way they went
---
Ok who cares it doesnt change the game that much grow up
---
Don't forget to bring a shitton of ammo. I ran out on my first run and if it wasn't for some nice level 100 who came down and assisted i wouldn't have been able to get much further.
---
you mean in the vendor I assume not just randomly lying around
---
No, keep it in the game.
---
**sweats in melee**
---
its not about being mad, it's explaining that paying for this item creates changes in priorities for perks if you have money. luck of the draw and super duper, 6 points in luck. they are now completely irrelevant because armor repairing no longer requires grinding. thats 6 more points in luck than a non atom buying customer that hates grinding mats will have. That's an option only if you invest in repair kits. player behavior change and different rules based on money.
---
Because to you it might not matter, in a practical sense. But someone min/maxing will spend all their time getting legendaries while you're not. This creates a time/resource and perk management gap between you and me if im buying repair kits. You may not notice, but the player thats getting 2x the legendaries because of this will have better stuff. 
---
Changes to player behavior because money is never good.
---
No, go away
---
Found Ansel at the Mine's Monument.
---
I've found the track lighting to be very bright, but it depends on how close you mount/aim it to a wall.
---
Base repair kit is only to 100%.  The free improved repair kit is 150%. Which gives a damage boost. So, pay to repair to 100, with no damage boost, or kill queen/squatch for a chance to get 3, which gives a damage boost.
---
I think you'll find they changed their minds, which  is not lying.
---
Yeah but this shows they lied about the game
---
wow toxic
---
:’( how will i ever recover from your mean words
---
Ok. Thanks. That's what I thought.
---
I work nights (eastern US) and on my nights off I end up meeting players from Australia and all over when locals are asleep. Met some great people.
---
I can't re-discover the dam and that's the only place I need.
---
What the heck, they're lazy enough to slap it on any power armor and they can't decide on to give it out for free because they messed up. Hey at least you got the atoms back but that's such a headache and mismanagement on they're side.
---
Because I'm not going to just stop playing the game I already paid for. I'll intead fight tooth and nail to stop them from screwing it up.
---
Exactly, buy a cool new paintjob that looks awesome (even though it's just cosmetic) or buy weapon repair kits when I can just fast travel back to my camp for free and repair it cheaply with mats I can find easily? 
---
I know which one I'm choosing!
---
🤷‍♂️
---
The Yao Guai shot was the laugh I needed today.  Thank you.
---
Ah even better. I ended up wearing my excavator pa and weilding a black diamond.
---
There are a couple of benches but don't rely on being able to use them.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
It’s ok to admit you are wrong.
---
Oof
---
I AM PAPA BINOCULARS AND YOU WILL SPEAK TO ME WITH RESPECT YOUNG MAN
---
Too late. Its already over. The game has been torn to shreds. If you arent gonna quit you might as well stop buying. You are an enabler at best
---
We thought this happened right now but it appears the sheepsquatch died with her stealth on so we we found her after some searching.
---
I think the price is fair. You pay for the picture pretty much. A picture. -_-
---
I’m slowly building up plans I’ve got spares of, and vintage Nukashine! Vending is going to be awesome!
---
I have a feeling someone who is making decisions is too stubborn and greedy because we all know allowing kits in the game was not at all what the player base wanted
---
red dump truck next to the sub station
---
Oh yeah howso only things left is if someone wants to fight you they attack back your house obviously can be destroyed and workshops. Other then that al that is the same on pvp plus you can kill anyone at almost anytime. So please enlighten me.
---
Nope, at best I'm hurting them because I'm taking up a spot on the server without every purchasing anything in the ATOM shop. I'm actually the exact opposite, I'm a drain.
---
Hell, what about a ham radio that can ping your Pipboy when someone’s at your CAMP? Even talk through it!
---
It will
---
hell i'm a pistoleer and i carry a minimum of 4 pistols chambered in different calibers and a M79 to get my point across... lol
---
For plans! I hope.
---
They restrict camps in certain areas for the new content and unfortunately we can only farm legendary weapons at certain places, and there isn’t much else to do but that after you beat the game.  WS should totally be a restricted zone, I am tired of my spawns being affected by turret camps, and the a**wipes taunt you to destroy their camps, you know they put their camps there because they want pvp, so I say bring it to them, then they message you crying like a baby after.  I don’t mind the wanted status if I can farm my spawns, they are totally selfish putting camps there. I don’t grief or destroy camps but any WS turret camp is going down...oh and orbital strikes stopped working for my since last week, but you can still destroy camps today, took out a turret camp after the patch with my meat hook
---
pets.....pets......pets..... please. and fix the animal taming for camps.
---
We shall see, something tells me anyone with my unicorn shotgun won't be getting rid of it.
---
Hop to the vendor at Camden Park. Afaik they are always there or have a high chance of spawn from the vendor bot.
---
Yeah it’s weird but it’s on the list under robots. Weekly challenge.  Just wanted to see if anyone else has got it ticked off.
---
How did this bullshit get gold?
---
They are releasing awesome new power armor skins  constantly!
---
Tons of new camp signs and stuff today too.
---
They've given us blood stained armor, raider power armor. Plagued gear.  Its getting  better. And always interesting in my opinion. 
---
It sounds  like you  just want very specific weapon and armor variations and are not a patient person. 
---
They have updated tons since launch and people just want more more more, nothing is ever good enough. 
---
How can you be simultaneously angry about repair kits but then straight begging for more shit to chuck money at. 
---
Your post is a shit show.
---
As close to a Repsec as I can hope for?
---
My prediction for the future is that they are going to introduce vehicles. A questline to find them and get them back to functioning
---
1. 1 player Lone Rider motorbike
---
2. 2 player Raider buggy
---
3. 4 player armoured vehicles
---
4. 4 player Vertibird
---
It's a long shot I know, but apparently F76 is going to be around for a long time.
---
Yes there.
---
There are people who pay $1000 a week in mobile games for the chance of getting special character or weapon, and many others who may a "premium" cost every week, 10-20, to get in game benefits. Surely there are people who will pay $5 a week to not have to farm junk. Hell I'd be tempted if I could skip farming plastic.
---
I love the look of the wetsuit, but if I want to wear it as an outfit I can’t wear any armor. But at the same time, I use PA like 90% of the time. But I still like to look good under it, and the 10% of the time I’m out of it. I’m working on a Bloodied melee build, so will be wearing the PA less.
---
Adrenal Reaction gives gun damage
---
You need the correct Lens
---
No, most people have said they hate that aspect of the game because it just feels patched on, and added in after the fact. It is literally just a nuisance they added in so they could sell you a way to stop the annoyance.
---
What? I was going to buy that one but I use and like t51 so I guess you just saved me some atoms thanks
---
Just happened to me. Ehhhhhhhhhh stupid game!!!!
---
Well you could say so, but it is an 'existing location', and pretty much all other ones in the game forbid building close to them. I had a camp on my alt somewhere, actually forgot where honestly, but it got removed because an update made it no longer allowed to build there.
---
In my mind this is just an abuse of mechanics in the game to easy farm things, sort of an exploit. Not to mention it's just simply annoying and unfair for people who try to get some kills there for whatever reason. And a lot of other people dislike it, in such cases devs should at least openly discuss it, when it has been brought up so many times.
---
Sounds accurate
---
You get the advantage of mot needing junk to repair. With enough money you can completely avoid junk. Which means you will never drop junk and avoid the main death penalty in the game.
---
Additionally kits can be used to repair items for others, and you can charge caps for that, undermining people trying to sell in game materials used for repairs.
---
How are these not advantages?
---
I personally don’t think the repair kits give any advantage. If anything reddit gives an advantage with players being able to readily buy a Bloody explosive ect kinda weapons and full armor sets for PVP. Regardless all in all it’s reducing the amount of junk people need to collect plus you can get the kits from SBQ. Reddit market pages are more of an advantage than the repair kits. I don’t mind if someone downvotes it’s my opinion on the whole matter.
---
Knew I wasn’t the only one bugged by this. Disappointed to say the least.
---
&gt; That's an option only if you invest in repair kits
---
No its not...
---
Again there are plenty of players that already dont use these perks. Not to mention the fact that they released the improved repair kits that you can get off defeating a SBQ and things like that. Plus its only 50 atoms for a repair kit. You can use repair kits without spending money. How long does it take you to repair your weapons?? 2x the legendaries?? Seriously have no idea what you are on about. You go to a workbench and press like 4 buttons. Any change in the game changes gameplay. You are putting so much effort into painting repair kits as this evil game breaking thing.
---
Havent watched the video, but if anyone wants a map of the stealth boy spawn points, here ya go.

Umm I’m a PS4 player pls let me join you guys !

Sure, but this splits development.

Bethesda replied: Thanks for the report, we'll investigate!
---
Ah, OK, restarted the game and the circles are showing up now.
---

---
I could swear I remembered something about a briefcase, oh well
---
That would also be great! Someimes I'll just happen to look at the map and see somone at my CAMP, but a notification system would be very convenient.
---
Shoot a scorch in the back at close range gets it every time...lol
---
He has not tweeted about Fallout 76 since late November 2018. He couldn't possibly hide deeper than he already is.
---
Yeah I believe it was supposed to be added today. Might be wrong though, maybe just some unlucky lagg hit me or something.
---
And when your team has all 4 equipped you get a bonus nuke all the map option.
---
I joke but remember the last item set from the atomic shop
---
I really hope this is saracstic
---
Thank you. :).
---
Was gone for a bit but added now, thanks!! You mean the couple rows of folding chairs near a cliffside, right?
---
That may be the spin, but the fact is we were told one thing and they did another, which by definition is a lie.
---
Agreed 100%
---
I went to Grafton Steel Yard and repaired the vertibot landing pad (you don't need to capture the workshop for it).  So, the vertibot appears. I took about 4 photos from all sides and it worked.
---
I'll make a statement.  I use my Atoms for what I feel like and don't let others dictate what I do with it.  I may or may not buy them.  Most likely not going to get them just because I don't really care about the repair kits but this community is taking this too far.  Get over it.  The way you act it's as if it's the end of the world.   50 atoms for a repair pack isn't really a big deal.  You clearly know that Bethesda is already aware of the feedback.
---
The developer or the player? I feel like Bethesda has developed their game with micromanaging as a gameplay loop for years. And it has been exaggerated in FO76. Going on "adventures" is so tedious with inventory size, load out, supplies, repair status, that it feels like packing for vacation. I wouldnt be surprised if more than 20% of the game is spent in a menu of some kind actively trying to manage inventory size and repair. Not actively progressing your character. Managing the inventory.
---
You craft 10 and then scrap 10....
---
It's the known locations, there's just not a lot of stuff for new players or the likes that don't use Reddit or scroll threw it so thought to make this. 
---
Thanks for adding that man!
---
All personal opinion. You're just a salty spoiled impatient never satisfied person.
---
I have some information on some of these items that might help. I have personally gotten the ultracite gatling laser and assault rifle plan from census violence. I was having a conversation with someone yesterday and they said all the heavy raider armor plans have about a 3% chance to drop from signal strength which would mean you only have one shot at getting a plan per character which sucks. Another item is Shielded casual lining it’s only obtained from the dev room since it’s apparently bugged and cannot drop.
---
Unlockable in the Atom shop!
---
I wonder where they got the idea for the repair kits in the first place...
---
Not gonna lie, it’s the funniest thing to play with this patch and it wasn’t even intentional
---
I play solo exclusively and have yet to launch a nuke so for me it is difficult to get certain rare mats for repairs. I would rather use those mats to craft things I am actively pursuing.
---
The kits would allow me to use my showy armor/weapons without worrying about stashing them till I find new mats.
---
Yes, I could find people to play with or actually clear a silo and launch a nuke. But I haven't and don't feel I should be locked out of using my hard ground end game goodies because I lack mats.
---
For the cost of handful of dailies I can fix something and save my rare mats.
---
Maybe I'm not playing the game right. Maybe I shouldn't want to use some of my super duper stuff and ration its use. But mostly I just want to have fun.
---
I have 2 chars I play on the pvp server and one character that doesn’t leave the regular servers atm . Why because it has a nice house I spent a lot of time on. My pvp char’s have all their items in storage my camp is just that a c.a.m.p. and I only take them out in a as need basis. So your point is moot and completely well false and easy to say without maybe asking if I partake in said slaughter on the servers it belongs on.😊
---
They don't even have the code to instance things in the game. 
---
This studio has absolutely proven it has zero experience with online gaming like this.
---
It boggles my mind that there isn't even a report feature in game.
---
You can sell those useless items to a vendor at trainstations for example
---
It was a container for complainers - a way to keep the rest of the sub nice and tidy for Bethesda.
---
Oh I see.  You just wanted a public place to bitch.  Not actual feedback. :D
---
I took a photo of the cargo bot that drops a supply drop as reward for that morgan airport mini quest and it worked for me. I made sure the name appeared before taking the pic.
---
Tell us how you really feel
---
if you dont use these perks, im talking in circles now, then youre spending more time grinding for mats. like i said at the beginning. thus making the repair kit buyers and you have a bigger gap in what you're grinding for.
---
This is a gap that exists now, thats what the point of the kits are for. instant gratification vs time in griding for the mats to take to the bench. this exists. that's time difference and the reason the perks are an advantage. Again, talking in circles to someone that's refusing to accept different perspectives. Im done.
---
Pete Hines has been on the Rage 2 promotion circuit since December. Fallout 76 has been in his rear view mirror for almost half a year already.
---
Glad you see that too
---
Your definition of awesome and my definition of awesome are two different definitions.
---
Agreed. Sometimes their lack of testing makes the game more fun.
---
Yeah the one that has the Panda watching the show too
---
Flatwoods monster and red ants
---
Is this the one where you have to log off naked every time or your stats are wonky?
---
thats the first thing i found the first time i was allowed up there
---
the shocks on the other hand... :(
---
Doooooooope
---
Bye
---
commando and gunslinger are both perks
---
just bought 2 calibrated shocks today  (have 3 now) but never seen the jetpack.
---
Excellent information, thanks so much.
---
" While Repair Kits do offer a way to fix an item in the field, we feel  you will find that they are a convenient option you can utilize during your adventures. If we find that Repair Kits do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that **advantage** is removed. " Let me give you a clear example of how these very much offer a competitive advantage.
---
Imagine getting into a shoot out with another player when all the sudden your gun breaks. But wait! His gun breaks too! The playing field is even! Now we are both left to either duke it out with our fists or retreat. But wait once more!
---
The opposition has this special item called a **repair kit!** (Btw, i've yet to deal with the high level, near end-game SBQ which offer me a similar free alternative). They quickly bring up their pip boy, repairing the once broken weapon. 
---
Now it comes down to, can I outrun this maniac with a seemingly unbreakable weapon?
---
This is just one case in which the repair kits **will** offer an advantage to a player in a PVP situation.
---
Indeed, the player should carry a backup weapon(and equipment that's not close to breaking) in most cases but that's not point.
---
With Bethesda implementing this, it also goes to show no matter how much the community pleas, it will have little to no effort in the actual outcome of what happens.
---
Thanks for listening to us, Bethesda!
---
I mean, obviously they decided against us and going against their community here. We tried, Bethesda didn't listen. But oh boy, I'm almost curious if my fears are true and they really got the balls to implement something like refrigerators in the atom shop - then I'll gladly abandon this game and watch the world burn.
---
I was thinking that it might be a special "find extra loot" random for completed hacking. Kinda like a scavenger perk. Though I'd rather be able to finally "hack" robots
---
here come the personal attacks...
---
Man these look great! Hope those gun perks arn't in agi though.
---
Preferably buy, not farm, LOADS of aluminum &amp; steel (minimum 10 bulk each).  Get/craft a good low level weapon that hits reasonably hard (.308 weapons like hunting rifles are good- have enough ammo). Take over a workshop with a vertibird pad. Repair pad, shoot down vertibird (ideally have a higher level character actually do the takedown after lower level gets enough shots in). Rinse, repair, repeat. 
---
Be sure to use xp-boosting perks or aid like cranberry cobbler to stretch out your investment in materials. It’s not the most fun method, but you get about 300ish xp per vertibird.
---
...Well...EXACTLY
---
You are making posts about a games developers not catering to your  very specific personal tastes. 
---
They cant possibly please everyone and are doing a pretty good job of giving us a bit of everything. 
---
Complaining about what is available when the game is only like 6 7 months old is just so juvenile and silly.
---
If anything it's going to be less than 50% maxed out.
---
Nothing personal there bud :)
---
I agree it's boring once you complete everything, but something about searching and hopping to find legendaries is part of the thing that keeps me coming back.
---
Guess I'll skip then, my build doesn't use any form of auto.
---
Brotherhood recon rifle plan is available to all via front computer on post at Ft Defiance once you start the quest and have gone through basic and have military ID. 
---
Plans for power armor as well once you complete quest is on computer on 4th floor in office where pool table is.
---
You are confusing Pay-To-Win with Pay-To-Play.
---
that's not punishing. if people are willing to pay $.50 in order to avoid 3 minutes of scavenging, I don't care. Entire industries are built purely upon providing convenience.
---
I kind of felt that way after patch 8.  My AA fire ax from 200 percent would make it all the way through a long scorched earth event, but after patch 8 it breaks if the event goes over twenty minutes. There were a few threads with others mentioning similar results  immediately after that patch.
---
You played non stop for months but didn’t get your money’s worth? If you are a gamer, you have a long rocky road ahead of you.
---
No offense, but this should have been looked at long before you made challenges for taking 30 photos. This now leaves a massive chunk of your player base at a disadvantage to PC players who can easily complete these challenges for atoms.
---
It is a social game, you should feel edged towards needing to trade with other players for those mats, not paying IRL money for them.
---
You can add me at fateofthelost on Xbox, I’ll run with you when I’m online.
---
Whenever I load in on pc this happens too. Then I get constant FPS dips for whatever reason.
---
At the Miners monument the tourist spawns on the north side of the stairs by the monument itself.
---
Bethesda, take note. 76 upvotes and over 600 comments...
---
No problem glad I could help.
---
that comes with the may patch.. if they don't push it back
---
The problem is they will never know this is why you are not paying for atoms any longer
---
Furthermore, saying the dev's are prioritising silly skins over things like pets is just so oblivious and stupid. Those things take massive amounts of programming and cant just be added without issues at the click of a button. 
---
You are the very definition of an entitled fanbase. You are a scourge on the gaming community.
---
New power armor paint in the Atom Shop applies to to \*all\* PA types? Even the raider and excavator?
---
\*And\* we get a Sheepsquatch plushie?!
---
Despite all the p2w stuff, this is awesome!
---
Pretty sure the puncturing pole hook mod is actually the extra hook mod. I have added it to two pole hooks before. I recall seeing the plans in beta and a while back but not in a few patches. I could be wrong but I could swear it was once in game.
---
I got one now but thank you
---
It is cosmetic. It makes your broken item look pretty again.
---
Or open the gallery, view the pictures and take a screenshot thru Xbox.
---
Saves to Xbox versus the game save.
---
Only downside is those won't count for the loading screens.
---
i wouldnt be surprised if the reports never got read xD. just emails to nowhere
---
may patch supposed to have the camp immunity.
---
Play 2 Win!!!!
---
Do it with a second character, but the dam seems bugged for many.
---
Huh, watoga bots not spawning legendaries imagine that.
---
Have you tried bitching and crying about it more? That might help.
---
Okay, sweet, just wanted to make sure! Thanks!
---
Yeah. Being able to make Nukashine is pretty cool. I need to find plans so I can set up a brewing station at my camp.
---
:D
---
Hey I'm open to trade 
---
Do you want anything else?
---
They're*
---
Thanks for this! Cant wait to get in and slingshot my dude across appalachia!
---
Yeah I have thanks for that valuable input, not sure what Id do without people like you
---
Agreed the camera is a fucking waste of time
---
Awesome write up! Great work!!
---
That is wrong on so many levels lol
---
Ain’t my post chief, just saying that I’m glad you like what they’ve got on the atom shop, I only like a few of em truth be told.
---
Yeah it's probably not for me
---
Use gamma guns or radium rifles
---
I still can’t get the quest has anyone else get this problem
---
Okay sweet.  I tried this at Poseidon and it didn’t trigger for me.
---
Few 3* weightless pieces, or I can add caps to cover the difference
---
Cool thanks, I’ll try and watch for this one to come on.
---
If they have a drop in sales after adding repair kits rather than an increase they'll get the idea. They'll also be keeping track if how many repair kits are purchased and but how many different people. A business like Bethesda has an analytics Dept. for a reason. They also follow Reddit and, based on the comment on the patch notes, know that this upset at least some of their fan base.
---
Ok, I was pretty sure that I saw it in one of the first patches, thanks
---
Are Bethesda somehow forcing you to use this camera? no? oh. k.
---
Do the guns come as max level, or do they match your level?
---
Again, ain’t my post chief, and truthfully I’m a bit too tired to even try to feel offended by your self proclamation of the type of person I am.
---
I misread
---
&gt;Now you are claiming I'm a noob if I run it. ROFL. You bethesda boot lickers sure can't make up your minds.
---
First and foremost,  I never called you a noob, I simply said it was a waste to use those perks or any of the luck breakage ones for that matter, my stuff just does break that much, even after sustained use. If yours does, perhaps you should reconsider your build. 
---
Second, I'm a boot licker because I disagree with your premise? Typical circlejerk kind of statement there. Sorry, my shit doesn't break anywhere near enough for me to ever consider repair kits, ergo, I just dont give a fuck about them, in game or in the atom shop. I dont give a rat's ass if some loads there toon down with 50, it makes no difference to me, pve or PVP.
---
TIL. Nice.
---
A ass/sent chest combat or BOS, I have a marine one
---
absolutely!
---
I killed one a few weeks ago..
---
Removing the Serum Recipe's is filth! I've just hit 50 and was ready to work towards getting them. Little pissed off about that and these changes not being in the official "patch notes" is damn shady. :(
---
Always willing to help out, gt: janospalfi 
---
Also, you should check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
It saves a good amount of space.
---
Same here but more so with my armor, I know they nerfed white knight but even after that it felt like they nerfed armor durability again
---
Great action shot
---
Big Iron perk card when???
---
Is that the same for the power armor carry weight? For some reason, mine constantly goes up and down ~100 points...
---
They own morons?
---
Wait this works on raider armor??? I might actually go for it if so.
---
The problem with that is I don’t want to have to grind for legendaries or go around killing high level enemies for a chance of good loot. If I wanted that I would go play destiny 2
---
No problem. Hope it helps :)
---
First time turned in \~20, just got stimpaks and ammo. Second time, same thing. Third time turned in less than 5, got the paint... I don't think it affects the drop rate.
---
So bulking actually helps unlike before.
---
No I just dont understand how this at all gives an "advantage" Damage is scaled, so someone who spends more time playing doesnt have as much of an advantage. I have taken out many many people who have put probably twice as many hours as me. This in no way affects combat, which is the only place it would give another player any real "advantage" over you. Just because they have a couple more points dedicated to damage doesnt mean theyll win. Thats like saying the cosmetics are P2W because someone can save time by buy the  decorations for camp instead of grinding for plans and materials.
---
*asses
---
suppose it's ok to link a Beth site in here:
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview](https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview) 
---
There you can open a "ticket" to let them know about your problem...
---
Last I checked only Lead and Aluminum saved weight
---
I just hope my ancestors can complete this hehe.
---
Pick one known spot and server hop.
---
Average 2-6 hops before finding.
---
Ever heard of call of duty? Literally the past 3 games it has been the same. No we aren't going to add in weapons to microtransactions and throughout the course of the games life cycle they add in more and more microtransactions until eventually you can get guns for money in those games
---
I feel like it should go both ways - you can toggle them as outfit or under-wear. 
---
I don’t give a damn about clipping
---
Are you on PC or Xb1?
---
Is this a console only issue??
---
I love me some Atom store items!  Mostly CAMP stuff because I like to snazz up my dogs 😅
---
Yo if they added an entire series of raider themed building stuff like giving us the ability to make a base look like some shit out of mad max id fucking pay them 60 dollars. I want junk walls with spikes and barbwire covering my buildings and walls.
---
Sorry I log off
---
Bought the jetpack, never see the Calibrated Shocks
---
Sorry I logged off
---
You thought people were farming for TSEs? Oh honey noooo. They were farming caps to buy the TSEs
---
Yea the problem is things are so convoluted in the data sometimes I miss things.
---
r/Market76
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
When the game launched, it turned out that only two materials weighed less when bulked and that everything else somehow magically gained weight when bulked.
---
Has someone confirmed item by item that bulking actually reduces overall weight on all materials?  I haven't done it, I just know that it got better - to the point where my overall weight always goes down when I check storage, bulk what I can, put it all back in storage, and check the weight again so I assumed it was at least fixed enough to deal with.
---
They said explosive will not be appearing on energy weapons. Nothing other than that though
---
You can still get them from the enclave vendor but that's it
---
All an SSD does is improve load times.
---
Try turning down a few settings to low, such as shadows {which you did}, shadow distance {which you did} and lighting. Turn down the the fade and even water. If that don't help then textures would be next.
---
I think as a community we need to boycott the repair kits.
---
Was going to reply the same.
---
I got a tse shotgun. It’s a two star but I forgot the other benefit. I can send you the specs when I get home.
---
My apologies, thought I put it in the title, xb1
---
I wouldn't say ruin but they definitely make it harder on me
---
When someone uses terrible grammar to insult another's intelligence.
---
Sequentially by rank? This is the first time I've gotten a BOS paint, but it went straight to knight
---
How much for it
---
t60 with bos paint.
---
No need to mix and match.
---
You did, but you put IGN, which is a PC thing
---
Ooh, nice!! Adding that now, thank you!
---
We also don't have evidence that it wasn't working though. It's just as much a possibility it was fine, and the conversation was "you know what could bump revenue even more?".
---
We'll probably never know, but for a game that had the start it did, and has turned as much around, it's like biting the hand that feeds. And while it isn't necessarily Bethesda or the same scenario, ZOS had this issue with ESO. Shit launch, panned by critics, buggy mess. They've kept the crown store pretty clear of game changing items (they sell repair kits, but they're also readily available for cheap, as well as from any vendor). The game is still going strong, and follows the "live service" model FO76 is going.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that I'm definitively right. I just don't think this is an effort to make the store profitable. Even if it was, I don't think it's a fix, but a bandaid, as the core community doesn't seem too happy about it.
---
Have you seen some of the new datamined stuff, also the statue was great
---
And you've done it. In one fell swoop you killed this game for me, and every other Bethesda game ever.
---
As an adult with a family, I have limited time for games. I am not going to waste my time and money any longer on Bethesda. 
---
You got one over on me Bethesda. Good job taking me for a lot over that power armor edition. 
---
Fool me once, shame on you. I will need to make sure I am fooled no longer.
---
I will just save my time and money for companies who do not take advantage of their own player base in the worst ways, abandoning all promises made.
---
Enjoy your shitty pay2win game. I am done.
---
We would be if most people only wanted trades and not caps.
---
I don't care.
---
There was a cowboy perk back in new Vegas. 
---
It buffed revolver, lever-action firearm, dynamite, knife, or hatchet.
---
Okay I see your point for "using the Repair kits for your dressier armor or weapons".
---
I wish you good fortune in the Great War to come.
---
I accidentally bought something too, cant remember what but I was though 🤣
---
Mr. handy is good as well I was doing 50 per hit with mine lol eating through critters like buttah!!
---
Is Bethesda way over hyping content and practicality lying to their player bases face? Yea...or were under a rock when Todd said that "The Burrows" was going to be a "high level dungeon" that would "require at least two lvl 50 players or more" only to be led through a lack luster sewer sytem that takes 12 minutes to fight through only to find a NOT EVEN LEGENDARY assaultron and THATS IT! You're correct, I wouldnt use the camera even if it had better features but good thing thats not my point! The point is, they are going to keep shoveling out shit until the community makes a stand on what we will and will not accept anymore...and frankly, I dont care what you think, Im getting tired of hearimg about "new content" only to be disappointed over and over again
---
A toy one?
---
Makes me laugh every time.
---
Great final shots. The only enemy that makes me run for real are the **Yao Guai** lol Oh hell no if there are two of them coming for me.. Later! I thought I was all bad ass a few times and 1 to two hit and I was dead :) I go all sniper mode when I have to deal with them..
---
Haha sorry man. I got all flustered
---
Cool thx
---
I apologize I thought you were OP
---
Yeah. Except that never happened here. 
---
Prior to the launch, on November 2, two weeks prior to the games release Bethesda posted a "Welcome to the Atomic Shop" post. 
---
It clearly states the items featured will not offer a competitive advantage. 
---
The repair kit does not offer a competitive advantage. 
---
Soooooo
---
It's explained in the lore. We were all highly competitive, so much so that the Overseer had the ability to lock us in our rooms, cultivate sportsmanship, and give out awards to soothe our superiority complexes. I actually have a theory that Vault Tec didn't only select the best and brightest, but the ones who reaaaally thought they were the best and brightest
---
It’s all good friend, we all have those moments
---
I haven’t started playing today, as my game is still updating. Should I go to these locations to look for the camera or do I need to do a quest?
---
Please help
---
The regulars I play with are French, I love my peeps and cant imagine spending any time in the wasteland with anybody else 😊
---
Yeah, they're awfully expensive though. ((I don't Trade.)) And ain't they locked behind RNG as well? Regardless, the general not being transparent in their update is a massive bummer. I've loved this game since release, so darn disappointing. 
---
I never said thank you though, seriously, thank you for posting this!
---
Ah, mostly a PC gamer, got fallout 76 on xb1 though sadly aha, edited for GT
---
They said they would never do something and are now doing that something. If that isn't lying, what is?
---
Oh Bethesda makes call of duty I get it now
---
Oh right, whats wrong with running combat shotgun builds? You may want to look into it, combat shotguns degrade nearly as fast as old energy weapons do. You are required to run gunsmith 5 or you'll be repairing them every hour.
---
It’s all good friend
---
Most national, and state parks have flags at them. But yes, merica bad, everywhere else is great.
---
The only thing I really hoard is Acid, Ballistic Fibre and certain Meds. Everything else is pretty easily farmed, but it kinda depends on the character you’re running
---
No your IQ would be too low for you to get much of anything
---
The Atomic shop announcement made November 2nd was very clear about "No competitive advantage"
---
And oddly absent of the phrase "Cosmetics oy"
---
Yes I had a furious 10mm it shredded
---
I see, thanks for the info :)
---
Why would we need a perk, if we have the mutation?
---
Second, my husband and I keep finding launch codes but, we have yet found a silo to launch anything yet.    So the launch codes are always expiring on us .We have fun just roaming and taking turns helping each other on our mission lists.
---
So like a timer, like adding a medkit in any Battle royale game
---
So if Im in PVP combat, what is preventing me from using one of these kits to repair armor that just broke?
---
If the answer is nothing, there is your competitive advantage.
---
Whats the challege requirements? I'm away from console right now. Can any friendly soul give me a heads up?
---
Yeah same. Idk i think some day i'll just realize i'm wasting my time and stop playing. But it is not this day.
---
I can make the ammo... Where do I find the paddle??
---
Yeah that's why I said I doubt it lol. It's just the first thing I thought of when I saw it
---
An emote icon =/= a new emote animation people want. How silly.
---
A different overhead??
---
Been seeing that a lot lately if you stop and look at it, your button option says close.  But when you try to walk through it will block you like it is indeed closed.  The worst part, it only does that to you the player.  If you alert an enemy they run right through it like it is indeed open.
---
erm....everyting looks good but the cpu. honestly id be worried with that thing. i ran this thing on 8bg of ddr3 and a 6700k. i couldnt do 1080p but 900p worked okay.
---
It's under the Nuclear Winter update on the Roadmap. So sometime this summer.
---
Wait, you found a sheepsquatch
---
Yes they were careful with their words today explaining how it was definitely not a competition advantage per-say. And it was also important they gave better ones no matter how rare in game only.
---
Gt dookieinyourhat if you want to meet up
---
Don’t know about that CPU, but RAM and GPU will be fine for ultra in 1080p.
---
It's not worth wasting the plastic on in my opinion. The space you save is largely down to using the plastic to bulk.
---
Who the fuck gave this bullshit patch gold . I happen to know many people take far better shits than this every day.
---
At the dev room
---
Good luck with that
---
My armor is a mix match of almost all the armors excpet excavator and t 44
---
There's eggs and stuffed animals everywhere haha
---
JK 50 mr fuzzy tokens at camden park
---
Tons of new CAMP signs and stuff?  They added 8 different CAMP signs and a few skins, not tons.
---
The Blood Stained Armor can be made in like 10 minutes.  It is okay but nothing to go crazy over.  The Plague Rider skin is, again, okay but still not worth buying.  For 1400 Atoms you are just buying an X-01 skin.  The Bone Raider Excavator Power Armor skin was by far the best Power Armor skin.  Maybe if you had read my post, you would have acknowledged that I said it was a great skin.
---
If I am not going to be a bit specific when it comes to giving a suggestion, then what makes it a suggestion?  Should I just say “Hey Bethesda, give me more skins!”?  Sounds silly, yes?  A suggestion helps them get a better understanding of what I would like to see.
---
Purchasing Atoms contributes to the development of future content.  If they quit adding things, we get no future content.  So is it really crazy for people to continue suggesting things?
---
The Atomic Shop was promised to have cosmetic only thing.  Repair Kits are not cosmetic.  And it is very possible that more non-cosmetic things will be added.  They hinted at a refrigerator and ammo converter in a previous Inside The Vault article when they introduced Repair Kits.
---
Sounds like your comment was a shit show compared to my post.
---
Waste of atoms.
---
The quest, which makes you fight the "sheepsquatch".
---
Dont believe the real thing is in game(yet)
---
That's not a horrible gun...
---
Yeah the animation that appears over your head
---
Sorry, I dont find that to be the case.. even if it was, I run with multiple shotguns in my quick slots. My primary TSE CSG breaks the quickest, but I can go most of the day without worrying about it and if it happens to break I go to either my pump TSE or my quad CSG. A little planning goes a long way.
---
Will it be back?
---
Most definitely.
---
Will it be back SOON?
---
not likely.
---
I mean...I get it, but on the scale of "lies" this is pretty weak.
---
A charitable interpretation of your screenshot there is that *when that comment was made* there were no plans to implement Repair Kits at that time.  It was in the summer of 2018.  I don't think it's outrageous to think that Pete did not know they'd be putting Repair Kits in the game in April 2019.  Pete did not even realize what the stash box limit was at the time, so I don't have a hard time believing that Pete Hines isn't an all-knowing all-seeing oracle/mystic.
---
I've been lied to many times in life.  Big lies.  Life-wrecking lies.  Scar-leaving lies.  Pete Hines making an offhand comment a year ago about something that went in a slightly different direction?  I'm not gonna crucify the guy over that.  Unless you can provide "proof" that he knew what he was saying would turn out to not be true a year later.
---
Darn hoping it save some space and it logically should.
---
You monster.
---
As per above you need to craft/scrap various items
---
It works out really strange for me - I made 1st photo from back of the bot and it didn't work. So I started just running around and taking photos from different sides. Camera seeking made me crazy 😵  But at last it counted.
---
I run a mix. A little bit to spread out repair resources (repairing my ultracite legs takes a few different things then fixing up my T-51B torse), partly because of mod availability and it's fun to walk around in a custom looking set . Find some paints that kinda have the same color scheme.
---
I use an automatic shotgun with the Anti armor and repeated shots do more damage due to each pellet counting as a new hit. The damage ramps much faster with my shotgun than a TSE.
---
I mean why don't you just route it to PS4 (or whatever system) screenshot storage? That's where the rest of my game shots are, you guys could put yours there too so all the photos go to the same place instead of awkward FO76 that go to some hidden treasure chest, location unknown.
---
Except you'd still have to farm junk for all the other shit you use junk for. And those whales are like 1 out of 10000 people at most. If someone seriously wants to do that, they suck at the game and nothing they do will change how well you play the game.
---
Yep. Same case with the holiday emote bundle. If they're not going to add new emote animations, why do they even bother? The emotes could really use a preview image or better yet an animated one at that.
---
It has to do with switching from a gatling gun, I've had it happen a couple of times by accident. When it happened to my TSE auto laser with a splitter on it, well, good times.
---
Hahaha
---
Go to bolton greens, he is right there on the fountain, probably easiest to find. I check a few other areas .. right in front of the house.
---
Bethesda started microtransactions with the Horse Armor DLC let's be realistic
---
&gt; vendor at Camden Park
---
thx
---
I can repair my weapon and armor to 200% condition. Supplies are plentiful to do so too. The repair kits seem pretty worthless to me. If someone's dumb enough to buy them or even more hilarious, use them while in combat, they're gonna die in a menu screen lol.
---
Considering the only reason 76 was a "control vault" was so that the overseer could go out and claim the nuke silos, i can believe that some executive decided to make the selection process a bit more interesting by pocking super competitive people.
---
same on pc.
---
server stability improved. hahaha server stability my ass
---
now game servers down as well as official forum
---
someone fucked up again
---
Yea I know, I was like 'NO WAY SOMEONE FOUND IT', sorry
---
I tried this at one point:
---
T-60 helmet
---
X-01 arms
---
T-51b torso and legs
---
You should try and see
---
Not officially scheduled yet, just something they're working on.
---
They only spawn In one of many locations per server. So I have to server hop the same few spots till I find one. Haven't seen one there yet.
---
I accidentally bought the Atomic lamp a long time ago because of interface lag, I instantly regretted it because of its steep price at the time but it grew on me as well, a lot of people also like it. Shame Bethesda had to go and remove it from the shop for no reason.
---
Been having the same issues are OP but I was also thinking it was a slow HDD that was part of the problem so I purchased a new SSD. Installing it tomorrow and will check back to see if it helps.
---
I really need to start collecting those tokens. Lol
---
They still are OP.  No need.
---
It launched me from Site Alpha to Harpers Ferry. And also it's launching me into a loading screen, and then I fall to my death!
---
Right? The irony.
---
Any chance I can have your caps?
---
Are you still on the same server?
---
I can confirm they are all still saved even if removed from the in game photo gallery, however I do still feel the in game gallery is small and needs a substantial increase (I'd rather not have to remove some of the older pictures and feel that having more options for load screens in game would be a good thing).  I would also like to see a method to actually add a character picture back to the character listing in the event you have changed consoles or have a character from the BETA (as presently the game will only show the ID picture if it was taken on that console and after the BETA).
---
Well that's your choice,  now isn't it? If you dont have a decent backup then I suggest you work for one, like I and many others have done. To be reliant on a single weapon is just daft IMHO.
---
Did you get them yesterday?  They self destruct every Monday night from the previous week.
---
I think i can give you some of mine
---
I consider my weapons broken if they get down to 99% lol.....  Repairing my fireaxes to 200% is a must!!  Just wish I could repair them without having to wait until they got below 100% lol.
---
I have.  
---
The other Horsemen of the Apocalypse skins look great as well as the Nukashine skin.  I kinda hope that is added as a reward from Biv because his rewards are a little underwhelming.  Same with the Nukashine kegs.
---
The skull mask is also pretty cool too.  Hopefully it is compatible with certain headgear.
---
I guess? Minus the BR thing?
---
It's not uncomfortable. However the Imposter Sheepsquatch counts for the challenge
---
We may need to know more about how you play before we can provide you with a useful answer. But, sneak can be a finicky weasel. And its effectiveness can vary depending upon how you have your perks set up, how you move while in cover and the environment, whether or not any of your gear is chameleon and also how straightforward you are in your movements toward your targets. 
---
For instance, crouching toward an enemy without Escape Artist, at a certain distance, you may as well be standing straight up and waving at them. Stealth attacks are often cancelled when another player has alerted the enemy. Also, if you or anyone around you uses a Life Detection buff (berry mentats, targeting HUD) you can forget hitting them for 2x damage, because those buffs also affect enemy perception (if you are in range of their field of view.)
---
i honestly just wish theyd make fallout 3/new vegas size dlc with all the story, new weapons, and new mechanics along with it.
---
id buy them for 10-15$.....im currently not going to spend a single cent on this game past the 60 i paid for it.
---
if not in this game, at least mabye bring that back in the next. no reasponable person is going to spend 14$ on a single power armour skin when they could have gotten an entire 5-10 hour dlc in the past.
---
On PS4, can confirm.    
---
I don't play my rifleman for this reason. I will be 100% sure I have full clips in my sniper and backup rifles.  Enemies charge, I swap to my backup rifle, 0 bullets. (That's assuming it even remembers I had it equipped and doesn't just try to go fisticuffs.
---
Yes. Open your pip boy. Use the repair kit. Then start fighting again. 
---
Sorry you were dead at open pip boy.
---
every monday at 5PM PST
---
Hit me up, some random armor in my stash. 
---
I’m online, psn is the same as my u/
---
please don’t be meeeean :’(
---
I mean in fallout lore america was pretty shitty
---
Ywa, no one wants Fallot Battle royale
---
It is something those who pay cash won't have to worry about, so that is giving them an advantage over others.
---
It's not a bugged challenge. The Imposter counts as a sheepsquatch for the challenge
---
Im sorry I cant make it on tonight. Would tomorrow still work?
---
I completely agree.
---
I would love to build those really tall junk walls.  Fallout 4 also had some spiked barricades which would be awesome to build too.
---
Improved repair kit is still what you wan to have and it's in-game obtainable only, basic repair kit looks more like "fuck my life I forgot to repair my weapon and I'm in the middle of &lt;something&gt;"
---
Supposed to be a small patch size but my ps4 I'd trying to download 60 fucking gigs
---
just... how XD great job though
---
At least the two shot part would be nice.
---
Not for much longer but yes
---
I mighy still be able to get on at 8:15-8:30ish
---
Come to me ..
---
This.  👍
---
There's a difference between lying and changing your mind/being wrong.
---
I might be able to get on at around 8:30ish ET
---
No. It's not Per-se.
---
It's just not a competitive advantage. 
---
Stopping to repair anything mid PVP is not viable. You will die opening your pip boy
---
Yes. I was hoping for new emotes cause I want a laughing one and a shocked one and more sarcastic ones but nope.
---
What’s you gt?
---
Honestly they're so much harder than deathclaws.
---
I have a trading post 
---
If anyone wants to trade for other things I'd be willing https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfipqp/i_have_some_fantastic_firearms_to_flare_your_fancy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
There was a guy on here who told me I was an elitist because I thought needing to repair during the SBQ fight was dumb. Come prepared. I guess he is who these are for.
---
How are people gonna know how to do this in like half and year or a year? They probably won't know it even exists.
---
ahhhh chameleon deathclaw
---
Nope. I'm never going to drop them. You never know when you'll need them. Partial /s 
---
Besides it's not my job to keep the servers stable by managing my inventory. It's my job to play the game however I want, which includes hoarding all of my holotapes and notes for the slight chance that I may listen to them or read them one day for my own personal enjoyment.
---
Also I've never experienced my stash being "laggy" because of that. Not saying it doesn't happen, just saying I haven't experienced it.
---
Um, ok, whatever dewd. If that's your definition of competitive advantage,  so be it. 
---
Tell you what though, you go get all the kits you want and I'll bet you my preparedness will trump your advantage every single time in a head to head PVP. Care to try me?
---
I just don't get this argument. They don't add any value to anything, and they aren't pay to win because perks offer better repair values. Why are repair kits in the atom shop such a bad thing when the only ones buying them will be lazy people who don't wanna farm junk for 15 mins?
---
I was ok with a nerf on tse's but it was massive and sweeping and effected other weapon types (explosive). I think the real answer was to have two shot and explosive both be major modifiers.  I really thought that would have been a much better solution than a flat out damage nerf. It was basically the two most powerful effects on one weapon. 
---
I think they also need to look at buffing and/or combining certain legendary effects.  Not everything has to have crazy damage but it should actually give you cool or useful bonuses.  Off the top of my head:
---
\-nocturnal
---
\-enemy specific damage (trouble shooters, exterminators, etc.)
---
\-stalkers
---
\-mutants
---
\-lock picking
---
\-etc.
---
I really like lots of the legendary effects but so many are absolutely useless. They could expand the game so much by combining abilities and creating new ones.
---
It's pay for convenience and substitution of an annoying aspect of gameplay (either finding a bench or sitting through a loading screen to fast travel).
---
That is not "cosmetic."
---
Thanks for this info and for the data mining you do. We would never know for certain without your work. Shame on Bethesda for not including this in their patch notes.
---
I'm not logging in again, sorry. Not unless they remove pay2win.
---
Well, yeah, duh.. i dont see how a timer for the repair kit would make it a battle royael tho?
---
Except it is, with these repair kits it allows players who have these kits to run builds that don't care about durability of their items. So they don't need to worry about running gunsmith 5 or white knight 3, or any of the other perks that slow item degradation. Meaning they can spend those points on skills that up their damage or tankiness well over what a normal player could hope to compete with.
---
The vampire baton interests me
---
Yes, just the raider PA model will swap to X-01 Plague Rider visuals.
---
9 mods and they are pretty bad. They need to sticky a post about the repair kits too.
---
pm'ed you
---
Yes, they can be hotkeyed.
---
It's not pay to win though, which the game already is but not through fault of Bethesda
---
I'm level 20 and a level 29 came up to my camp and started shooting me through the doors trying to break in. Little did he suspect a level 200 (I think maybe higher) walk up behind home and give him a 1 shot 😂 He gave me a thumbs up and let me live in piece LOL
---
Cool story
---
What’s wrong with it?
---
All hail Wise Mothman, he has blessed us with the grace of Atoms!
---
The mods putting all the post into one got rid of all the important attention this subject needed , I strongly feel this in part to blame. Two days this got the coverage it needed , then I never saw another word of it here. Bethesda figured oh that died down quick. It never died down , our words were filed into an incomprehensible blob post . They needed to see all the upvotes that those post had to see the severity of this. I knew as soon as the mods pulled those post, this was certain to happen.
---
Unfortunately, it's pretty much a given that if they DO hear these complaints and address them, they will do so in the least useful/most stressful way possible.  Pretty frustrated with the response to feedback from this developer around their games, both in the "current situation is especially bad" sense, and in the "they have a fucking horrible quality control track record" sense.
---
It does great for up close work against lightly armored creatures. Anything super mutant or more heavily armored I found my 1* AA 50 cal does shorter work of them.
---
Wut?
---
Still can’t get over it huh?   Sad.
---
Don’t tell me what to like.  😁👍
---
Fallout was a dying game dead from the start nlw that makes a fuckton of sence
---
Thats what the leader singer of Weezer said the other night at the concert I went too.
---
Oh right... so the symbol is the same?
---
Wrong account.
---
You want to look at u/bethesdagamestudios_
---
Notice the underscore at the end. :)
---
I don't know if this matters but you don't have spaces after your commas. Everything you added is mod.ba2,mod2.ba2 and normally it would be mod.ba2, mod2.ba2.
---
Thanks. I had to try many different routes until I found one that worked. I do have the marsupial mutation plus speed demon to help climb. I also have the bird bones mutation in the event that I did fall so I didn't die every time. Still took me ages.
---
Yet here you are, still bitching about it on the subreddit 🤷‍♂️. Seems like you didn’t “quit it” after all.
---
Bethesda Game Studios never made the promise of "Cosmetic Only"....
---
They clearly used the term "No Competitive Advantage" on November 2nd when announcing the Atomic shop prior to launch.
---
The promise was cosmetic only. They lied. That's the real bottom line.
---
I do this to sell to venders for another 1400 caps but I didn’t even think to do this, I’ll just store my caps on my alt so I can use my main, thanks for reminding me I even have an alt for other things besides selling stuff lol
---
It absolutely does, because with the repair kits you can repair while remaining crouched so you never appear on the map to be hunted in survival. That is a distinct advantage other players don't have.
---
I gave up trying to do anything with the camera for this reason.
---
Mind if I hop in when you find one?
---
You must be carnivore
---
Whats your gt
---
that's quite inspirational, i do have demon and marsupial so now that i know it's possible i need to follow your example and reach it!
---
They can be hotkeyed.
---
Wait stripe where
---
I run T-51b helmet, torso, and arms. T-60 legs!!!  I'm not sure exactly the defense I get from it but it seems my legs take by far the most damage and T-60 legs are super cheap to repair. I think its steel, aluminum, and plastic!  The old T-51b legs needed like 30 springs or something crazy.  Major QOL upgrade since I don't have to dink around looking for rare materials to repair.
---
I have it all painted camo so I don't think you can even tell.
---
Then quit posting here
---
Log in and out
---
Hold on, what? I don't remember ever finding that plan or seeing the gun in game. What does it look like?
---
I lost 12 items since I started keeping a log of what I have on my mule.
---
How much are they anyways? I havent been on at all today
---
Some mutations really ramp up your metabolism, even with starched genes &amp; class freak perks maxed.  I need a lot of food to fuel my merry mutant. Even after I’m done gnawing on all that fresh long pig.
---
Only going to be here 5 more minutes
---
max lv
---
Can I come too?
---
Sorry, but the ripper still sucks compared to anything else. I have a bloodied that does 14 damage. I am at 41 strength too. My Mr handy can do 400 a second. That's 400 damage a second. Ripper is 14 per second. I can even punch harder than the ripper. The drill does more damage too.
---
Open the picture in full screen, take a screenshot, upload to OneDrive. That's what I do.
---
Nah. I've been playing since the BETA. I've made a bunch of characters to try different builds. I've finally found a sneak/sniper I'm happy with and she's almost level 40. I'm still having fun; sorry you're not.   
---
Oh, and I tried to play Warframe. It sucks. See? We all have different opinions.
---
Have you done the nukashine quests? If so you should’ve gotten them already.
---
Can I get in on that too? Been hopping for hours...
---
But bro! What if my weapon breaks mid PVP fight?
---
in FO4
---
Ya join me rn
---
Oooh i see what he meant now sorry, high in fever here
---
No they never said that.
---
I feel like I have to call you a jerk but I don't really mean it.
---
Still can’t paint my lever action rifle, so I guess that part didn’t make it into the patch
---
From my PoV as a non-pa combat shotgun user it lookls like this: useless PA paint, useless PA paint, usless PA paint, useless PA paint, dozens of useless PA paints yet to be added, awesome combat armr paint, usless PA paint, 2 sets of useless PA and weapon paints, useless PA paint, not a bad outfit that fits the theme but i don't like it much, Tactical Ops! Yes! No...it's casual underarmor so no shielded variant and even i could make it shielded stats won't fit my build anyway. Pass.
---
🙏
---
good call... I totally forgot.
---
I stopped playing over this. F
---
Ultracite laser gun plan exists for sure, I have it learned. Same with .50 cal, assault rifle, and guitar sword. I'm pretty sure I have some of the armor mods learned but I'll have to check
---
So many spare plans. I’ve got like 10 pounds in just spare plans! I can’t wait. I’ve gifted a few just today because I’ve gotten a bunch of repeats and need the space for junk and weapons lol. I think I’m gunna end up selling legendary items and booze. Alcohol and firearms, the way of West Virginia
---
+karma and photo op
---
Same here for Xbox
---
Whoosh!
---
I've noticed Door issues on PC as well, although not quite like you describe.
---
OH HAHA I forgot I had carnivore 😂
---
No. I wasn’t sure how to initiate them. Was that the thing where you were supposed to be able to post a flier on your wall at a Camp and read to take part in a “party” or whatever? I tried to post it and couldn’t find it in my inventory after getting it from the Shop.
---
That’s not what this whole argument is about.  But that’s okay that you don’t understand that position.  Some people just lack the aptitude.
---
There was a stealth nerf to condition rate last patch. At least to energy weapons there was. Back when everyone was complaining that energy weapons broke too quickly, mine never had a problem. I almost never had to repair it. After the patch to buff their rates, I still had no problem. But after the patch a couple weeks ago, I feel like I'm repairing my Tesla rifles all the damn time. Prior to that patch I was pushing well over 3k cells through a Tesla before a dent was made in its condition bar.
---
You’re showing offline. Drop me an inv. GT is same as username. KillerWhitman00
---
You must have missed the part where the MODS were removing the posts after 24 hours. Not that they weren't being posted.
---
&gt;It’s a full repair that’s a lot of material for me to not bitch about
---
As far as I know, each repair kit repairs *one* piece of equipment. A full repair on a single piece of equipment is not a lot of material. At all. Plus, spending that material instead of using a kit gives twice the durability, and increased damage or resistance.
---
But go on, bitch about people being able to spend money for a hugely inferior repair option because they save like two pieces of ballistic fiber. Wow. What an advantage.
---
The PS4 version doesn't even say what button you're supposed to press, but I've pressed everything with no luck. Any ideas?
---
Then what did you do before they were introduce,d? Do you run the game with only one weapon in your inventory? Do you check and see, oh well my weapon is about to break but lets no go to my camp to repair it?
---
The actual wave is the same. The picture that displays is the only thing different.
---
I did that a bunch of times but it didn’t work so I just server hopped again to find another tourist and when I found him and took everything from his inventory it worked
---
Honestly I still think they shouldn't have done the original 3* nerfs, and the max level nerf with mole miners is something that still makes my blood boil.
---
I'm 600+ hours into this game, I've farmed more legendaries than I'd care to think about, I've gotten one "awesome" not god roll, but pretty fucking awesome, item. 
---
Of course, the game also ate it in a deleted item bug, but that's another issue. 
---
I cannot, in any way, agree with any stance that non garbage legendary gear needs to be HARDER to get.
---
My gt is urlnightmares, inv pls as I've been searching since noon for it lmao
---
No they never said that, I believe like the other guy said it was removed from energy weapons. I think they should seperate them though and rebuff both effects.
---
/r/nocontext
---
I appreciate this being acknowledged, but I'm not even honestly sure why there is a limitation at all. Consoles have gigs and gigs of storage these days.
---
In the meantime I highly suggest staying away from challenges that are going to be difficult to complete or require mirco-managing storage space by console users.
---
Repair it to 200% Mr. Handy is a bit better.
---
Thanks so much! Nice house, don't know about the scorchbeast out front tho...
---
Just found her on my server. Hop to me I'll hold her for about 15 mins
---
Psn is xxspace360xx
---
If you are dumb enough to help destroy the game you paid for that is on you. I'll just sit back and laugh at you.
---
Hunting rifle you can make a level 1 all the way to 50. 308 with recon scope. Great rifle actually! 
---
Once you start mission and go to basic and get militaryID and all that ...
---
The rifle comes equipped with the following modifications upon crafting.
---
Hardened receiver
---
Stabilized long barrel
---
Aligned stock
---
Stinging magazine
---
Short recon scope
---
Suppressor
---
For a full list of possible modifications see Hunting rifle.
---
The plans are at by reading at the terminal which is located outside Fort Defiance on the right when facing the doors to go Fort Defiance.
---
This
---
I right out unistalled. I'll reinstall after they are gone.
---
So... Question... If the camera does now exist.... How do we find and get it?
---
I just did the same thing... it was a vertibot, not 10 ft from me, and wouldn't count it
---
Retarted is what you are.
---
You mean like stashing all your junk and aid in your stash before entering survival mode?
---
Ha! Thanks. And yeah, that’s just my pop up camp, usually have a much more dramatic locale.
---
They’re under misc, and they have weight.
---
Awesome you're the best. Adding and joining now.
---
The game is no better off than it was at launch. Bethesda aren’t trying, they broke a promise and are replacing every bug they fix with another. This just a fucking mess. The game needs to be taken away from them and given to another team that know what they’re doing.
---
Really diggin through the old threads there aren't ya, partner?
---
It's really hard to keep thinking that they care about this game.
---
Downvoting shitty posts isn't censorship. It just means you're fucking wrong, dude.
---
my bloody ripper does 399 at full adrenaline and nerd rage. trade you for the handy though. its got that electricity damage.
---
Oh right 
---
You specifically quoted a word that every upset person has been spam quoting?
---
Or are you talking about the imaginary slippery slope and obvious path to P2W items in the future that no one has any evidence to support and is merely fear mongering and speculation?
---
You're inventing a battle to fight before it actually exists. How very political of you
---
Yeah, Ultracite Laser Gun is purchasable from BOS in Watoga.  .50 Cal is available from Raiders in Sutton.  I know Assault Rifle is a rare plan spawn and per this thread, also available from Census Violence.  I’ve set to see the Guitar Sword plan, but I anticipate its a Grahm plan like the Chinese Officer Sword.  Ones with * I am pretty confident are in the game.  I’m more curious about the ones I didn’t mark or commented on.
---
I have that too
---
Just added
---
I'm confused. They proved their morons did what?
---
Yeah at bolton Greens GT AtomicQuotient
---
This /\
---
You'll be killed and lose alot of items. Why would you even engage in a PvP fight with a weapon in such poor condition? Sometimes I think you want to die.
---
Imma start messaging you about this 😄
---
Exactly. Didn’t they even nerf some of the durability perks like White Knight a couple of patches ago? Seems awfully shady.
---
No, I was saying like how it would be a similar  mechanic to a battle royale, it wouldn't make it a battle royale but would have the timer thing or some indication that it has time because your doing something
---
Hell yeah! Hopefully includes power armor wearers. Have Pain Train, and one of the perks that reduces AP already, so running with a knife at the ready is something I already do. So the ability to do it more us alright by me 👍
---
Yep.
---
Several posts regarding this issue.
---
Still waiting put in another ticket will be my 3rd asked if there anyways can move this alone being help with PTSD issues no reply 5days no answer
---
If you are on PC check my posts I have a competition on Wed where top prize is a tse lever-action
---
Exactly. I was being smarmy about the bro thing. 
---
There's literally not one scenario where repair kits are pay to win. 
---
Hell there's not even one scenario where repair kits fit into a regular repeated use  scheme.
---
If they nerf durability just so they could sell these shitty repair kits they may as well shut down the servers.  That is some sneaky stuff. Hopefully it's just tinfoil hat conspiracy.
---
Your weight probably only goes down because you're using plastic. I haven't checked all items but aluminium and lead weigh less. Everything else seems to weigh the same whether bulked or loose.
---
Oh, well that's rubbish.  But I cant imagine what a wave goodbye would be other than what the hello looks like.  
---
I always used it for both.   A hello at the start and a bye for at the end.
---
Hey, dude. Here's the problem with your viewpoint. ""...And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works." ~ Pete Hines"
---
You're completely fucking wrong. That's your problem.
---
I ran into a similar issue earlier modding a weapon. It would act like it’s taking it, but nothing would change. I eventually got it to work by completely exiting the game and loading back in.
---
I feel ya. I’ll be moving my camp soon but I am still on the server!
---
Awesome, loading in now
---
Not defending the inclusion of repair kits, but the 'create monetizing way to solve it' doesn't carry nearly as much weight when there is a free (and better) method already available in game. If your gun broke and you couldn't fix it via any other method than repair kits, that would be another story, but you're paying for some convenience that isn't even the most optimal option in the game, because the paid kits are only 100% when you can repair to 200% by just repairing at a workbench (which are all over the shop). 
---
It's a pretty bizarre situation all around, both the inclusion of the repair kits, as well as making them worse than both the pre-existing game repairs, as well as the new 150% kits that *can't* be bought. Truly strange.
---
Alien blaster is in water in pond in toxic valley in an open safe. Ammo and a plan is located in TNT dome #2 ( I think that’s the right one)
---
 No problem! I’m about to move my camp because that was just a pop up camp but hopefully I’ll be on the server for a while.
---
Gonna have to check that out, ty
---
Haha sorry, i did not detect the sarcasm. But also i heard the same argument said as a real argument by a guy
---
Exactly. I was playing the devil's advocate. All these people are up in arms about nothing.
---
I don't pvp, pointless as it is literally just whoever gets the first shot. That isn't skill that is just latency.
---
I personally have zero tolerance for game companies who operate this way.  I stood by Bethesda when the game bashing was at its peak, but some of us old school gamers have a code.  This is scorched earth time for me.
---
Yep!  Different angles worked!  It won’t trigger until the name pops up but I think I was mistaken and thought it did!
---
So armor repair kits can't be shortcutted like stimpacks or food?
---
Best advice I can give is just to take it slow. Look around and plan out a route that could work. Keep the camera facing down to avoid falling off. Despite how steep it looks, the frame above the large dish can be walked up.
---
Once you do get to the top the views are stunning. You can essentially see the whole eastern side of the map. I managed to get some great screenshots.
---
Good Luck. Hope you manage it too.
---
It's just a hunting rifle with a good set of mods. Works out a lot cheaper than making a hunting rifle and then modding it, IIRC.
---
TSE are some of the highest DPS weapons, no thanks they are fine where they are
---
It started for me, it was a girl.
---
Maybe the mounted head in the taxidery shop closet?
---
Oh I know. 
---
The first step in using a repair kit is a PVP death sentence.... open pip boy....dead.
---
Excellent rebuttal, shows how good your argument is when you can't even offer one. ;)
---
Try connect to Tinkerb3lll if you can't connect to Atomic
---
They broke a promise they made during development. I'd love to help you but you'll have to be a bit more specific about what part of this argument you aren't getting.
---
imposter ssq doesn't count. not a dead one anyway. just tried to do it
---
You’re welcome, it’s an awesome rifle especially if you want to make one for a friend just starting out since you can make a lvl 1 rifle. 
---
With right perk cards it’s a great rifle!
---
I’m not there anymore boss
---
Got stuck in loading screen fast traveling to you. Rebooting now. So sorry.
---
Did it work?
---
Nobody's forcing you to be on Reddit, either, ya know.
---
:( have a good evening
---
Ok just check to see if I'm playing Fallout. If it's on Plants vs Zombies 2, Portal Knights or any Lego Game that means my son is playing. I'll be on @ around 9 after I put him to bedor so just join me I'll craft the PA as soon as I log in so it'll be in my inventory.
---
Do you need a frame? I can get one before I start if you do.
---
It is actually, read the rules of redditquete:
---
&gt;  regard to voting
---
&gt; Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.
---
I know most little people don't understand, but downvotes are not meant to mean 'i disagree'.
---
+karma I grabbed it, thank you so much
---
That's how it should be. In reality few people have the spine to dee it through.
---
Nice)
---
All good
---
There's a weapon and armor workbench like a 2 second jog west from drop site v9, at that shed where the exit from the glassed cavern comes up.
---
Ansel at Wavy Willard's, just like OP. Thanks!
---
its still fugly tho
---
No more serum recipes from the SBQ? Well there goes my only reason for participating in that event. If I wanted to roll the dice and get a random 1-3\* legendary I could just go to West Tek instead and spend a fraction of the time for the same result.
---
everything's noted, and here i thought that doing the obstacle treetop run was a challenge XD this will be a real achievement, can't wait, and again, great job sir
---
Operate what way? Releasing items completely in line with exactly what they said when they announced the AS?
---
I think the guitar sword plan was just a random drop for me. Also, I learned how to make a sledge hammer very early on. I guess it's possible the plan was removed from rotation since then, but I remember it was one of my first plans
---
I've tried to do it twice and it crashes everytime :(
---
If you’re on Xbox hmu with the stuff from your dead add
---
If you had them from before Monday, they self destruct when the code resets on Monday evening.
---
Gotta either re-farm them or go to nukacrypt.com for the codes.
---
You don't need them in your inventory.
---
are you wearing weight reduction gear?   
---
like food, drink, chems weight reduced by 20%  
---
weapon weights reduced by 20 %  
---
every piece of armor can have that stat bonus so you can massively reduce the weight of some items by stacking specific armor weight reduction stats, then as soon as you get into power armor you lose all stat bonuses from armor because you are now in power armor and all your weights of items go back to normal.   
---
say you stack 3 x 20% weight reduction on chems. you carry 200 stimpacks with you and they weigh like 20lbs. you step into power armor, weight reduction goes away those 200 stimpacks now go back up to 200lbs.  
---
thats not a glitch, that is the way its always been, you just have the animation of getting into power armor and out of power armor in your gear because bethesda was nice enough to not force us to unequip and reequip gear getting in and out of power armor.
---
Thanks! Jumped through all the locations on the west side, found her at appalachia cemetery.
---
The chances of a repair kit giving you an advantage during PVP or almost slim to none. Everyone’s who’s smart is going to repair everything to 200% before engaging with other players so there’s no reason you should have to use one in the middle of a fight
---
It's all good
---
 We will never see eye to eye on this issue and that's fine.
---
The voice, it's too soothing to stay away
---
Yeah but they will keep on bringing it up If we accept this then they will start making pay to win items
---
I don’t know where, but the Marine ARMOR helmet exists on pc only, forgot which one. I know theres a youtuber that has one
---
What location are you at?  I’m on Xbox but dunno all the spots they spawn yet
---
Yeah no, just accept the fact that you will, repeatedly, loose the best gear you have, over and over again.  Lost my best bloody sledgehammer a while ago, just gone. Lost a 3\* furious limb damage handmade two days ago, just poof.    
---
They, literally do not give a shit if people are frustrated by the never ending, soul-crushing buggy bullshit about this game.
---
No. You have to open your pip boy. Inspect the item you want to repair and repair it.
---
Dont forget the "time machine" on the estern side of the map.
---
You're going to need a lot more ammo. I had a TS .50 cal that I gave away on this sub. I made about 300 rounds for it, just to try it out. I made it through one location before I ran out of ammo. It's really fun though!
---
Yeah that’s the one. I believe there’s a poster for it and the sheep squat here quests at ever train station. Their under one of the Wall Decor tabs if you hit left thumb stick it should let you sort through what you own and I believe it’s towards the top and under one of the posters slots. Mine shows the mothman poster first if you have that one.
---
If you wouldn’t mind getting a frame that would be great
---
Only Bethesda knows
---
I server hopped for 2 hrs straight and only spawned that bot once.  He didnt have the coat.  Good luck.  I too would gladly pay 350 caps for one.
---
That specific outfit has only been data-mined. No images of it exist. But there are no outfits/armors/weapons that are limited to platform.
---
It says plague rider works with other armors too like ultracite, not just X-01.
---
Mods are fixed after the patch today.
---
I watched a video and that person used the vanity. It looked really good. That’s what I plan on doing.
---
As a PC player I agree, i dont understand why the pictures cant be saved until your memory ru s out on consoles
---
After an hour of hoping it didn’t , but somebody was kind enough to stay on the spot for about to hours and we shared the f out that location, but yes he’s on that spot Ansel Abraham’s
---
So why did you even bring up SP1 to defend your argument if it's not related? Lmao
---
You need a lens that has the ability to zoom. You should have been rewarded at the end of the questline. Craft it and install as a mod on your camera.
---
Remember when dataminers found lunchboxes in the files? Holy shit you guys are overreacting. Its really not that big of a deal. Imagine running a dungeon when suddenly the weapon you centered your build around breaks. You can either pull out your not as good secondary weapon or go back to your camp and repair it only to find you only have 5 screws and you need 7 to repair. So you go to another dungeon with a lot of screws. You are on your way out of the dungeon when a bunch of scorched come out of nowhere and kill you. You run back in grab your junk and sneak out and go back to your camp only to be over-encumbered from all of the junk you have. You take a beer and a buffout. And fast travel to your camp. You repair your weapon and go to fast travel back to the dungeon only for you to be hungry and thirsty. So you eat some food and drink some water and go to fast travel only to not have any more caps. You grab some water from your purifiers and walk to the nearest train station. You sell your water and finally fast travel to the dungeon.
---
Or you could just use a repair kit and get it over with.
---
This...really isn't pay to win. 
---
First off, it's just a repair kit, a basic one at that. Secondly, stopping to repair your shit mid-battle, while the game is still going and not paused like in new vegas or the other games, isn't exactly viable. If I wanted to I could, while you're taking your sweet time digging through your inventory for your weapons or armor to repair, kill you, maybe eat your corpse to flex on you, steal your shit and then be gone before you even come back. 
---
All this literally boils down to is you people are salty that they said "We won't do X" and then turned around and did X anyway, which, I'll agree is kind of shifty.
---
I'll get you one I know a few spawn locations
---
That’s awesome. Thanks for the tip!
---
Yes, PC has unlimited photo space
---
Ernest failure can be forgiven. Lying is harder to forgive since you cannot trust a proven liar’s sincerity.
---
You need to craft a new lens.
---
The ones you see in the game are probably stored server-side, which would be the most wonderfully annoying way of doing things, and explain why both the shots in the gallery and those on your HDD can be deleted independently with the other remaining.
---
Who do you think made fallout 76? BGS did.
---
seems clumsy, but infinitely superior to 'guess i lost; time to retreat back to my camp now' option for players who dont buy repair kits.
---
So you're implying that players will never be ambushed by players on a PVP server? It's just a fact that players will always have time to repair before they end up in a fight? 
---
Nawwww, yer silly. :-p
---
The fact your willing to be lied to and say it's ok disturbs me.
---
40 strength?
---
How?
---
Yes go to these locations and look for a dead tourist with camera. That will start the quest.
---
Oh It seems we have enough time to complete weekly challenges.
---
Lol I gotta try this
---
Isnt that not the lore guy?
---
41 strength?!?
---
No I'm not, but you can have your fun with your alt accounts.
---
Again, you use Reddit downvotes wrongly. Let's do that first.
---
Yeah the game hasn’t even been out that long.
---
That's still a disadvantage. It's not like you have to keep weapon artisan/fix it good equipped to get 200% durability and the increased damage/resistance that comes with it.
---
Awesome I'm over encumbered all the time, no need to pull out my Excavator armor any more to fast travel.
---
Lol you died
---
Yeah I have the same problem but the thing with this community is that they complain about the smallest things except me so I just put up with it
---
I think that’s just the static location of the gun and the plan in TNT dome 2 is the fusion mag, unless the scope randomly spawns there as well?    If you have it, I’ll server hop the location to find out.
---
Just going to point one thing out. I didn't see your first post. I can't judge it... But I can judge you. Calling people who disagree with you, "little people" is offensive on multiple levels, just to start. 
---
THIS post, however, is off topic, an attack on the community in general, and links to a gallery full of flip-off gifs. 
---
If you think _This_ post adds to the discourse on the topic of this video game, you're mistaken.
---
Listen to the arrest warrant holotape and you get the Falsely Accused quest that takes place at the penitentiary. It's a side quest, not an event like the other guy said.
---
At best it's pay for convenience. It gets you there faster, but levels aren't a "win" mechanic barring specific scenarios (like a level 80 against a level 10).
---
it doesnt increase actual damage, only limb damage (as in, how much damage limbs take before crippling)
---
One day I meet russian dude, he was lvl 5 and real talker. In survival mode. Didn't kill him though, and got no mic to tell him that he's going to be killed if he won't stop
---
Ideally you'll want FO76 on the SSD too, because the load times are pretty annoying otherwise.
---
Other specs will work as long as you're not running anything else.
---
I wouldn’t worry, when you can mod the game. This won’t matter anymore.
---
What a brave opinion to have on this subreddit.
---
\&gt;So if Im in PVP combat, what is preventing me from using one of these kits to repair armor that just broke? 
---
Me killing you while you're in your menu trying to repair your shit.
---
I'm starting to think the problems are less to do with the game and more to do with people's egos
---
&gt; ..And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works." ~ Pete Hines
---
I think there must be a communication problem with the mods or something. 
---
One of them mentioned once that if you sticky a post, you’re the only one who can un-sticky it. 
---
But my issue is the tons and tons of posts about the same stuff over and over. 
---
Also, how hard is it to sticky the patch notes? Tuesdays/Thursdays every time and they announce it beforehand so someone should at least be on top of that.
---
I noticed my breaking at scorched earth too, maybe it’s localized there to make the fight seem more difficult.
---
I thought they were OP and cool early on but when a few players leveled the SBQ in less than 2 minutes... what’s the sense of playing a game with out any challenges? 
---
I HAD one, I emphasize had... I kept on shooting and killing myself...lol (dumb but hey I admit it! lol)
---
Ok I'm playing belly of the beast mission then will add you thanks
---
As said already...lead and aluminum are the only ones that actually get a weight reduction per junk grouped. Some other junk items actually gain weight when bulking and other materials you'll just notice "less space" because of the plastic used to bulk. 
---
So for myself, I tag lead and aluminum because of ammo crafting. Those bulks items stay in my stash. The only time I bulk anything else is just to sell to the vendor.
---
Has there been a limited time item on the atom store that came back? It just seems strange since I’ve seen other people say that this armor was one of the few things they spent atom on and Bethesda makes it available for 4 days
---
Sorry my dude, but you won’t find anyone selling them for anywhere remotely close to that price.
---
Ohh tru
---
I did a lot of server hopping to get calibrated shocks for my x01... like a lot lot 😂
---
Not talking about those, Those can be swapped in when you repair at camp. Talking about perks like Gunsmith 5, white knight 3, etc. The perks you run to slow item degradation. The people who buy these won't have to run those because they can literally just fix the items on the fly instead of worrying about needing to finish a fight with a broken piece of armor or a broken main weapon.
---
That very well could be now that you mention it. I honestly dont notice it outside of that particular event.
---
Swimming merit badge is a mainstay if boy scout camp.  Could make sense for the upcoming scouting quest line
---
Aint gonna i dont even see them in the atom shop anyways im buying that imposter sheepsquatch skin tho
---
and I respawn and use it while you're still trying to figure out where Im going to respawn to, in your armor that you didn't repair because you didn't pay Bethesda.
---
the problem is, that the propabilty of getting the item you want on the market is so much higher than by playing the game. 
---
I have a bad feeling about the vendor, I'm hoarding 3star shit items on alternate characters. I think most of us do this and beth knows this... I dont think the verndor will give us Assassin/Sentinel pieces and BE guns. To get this stuff, you will always need a lucky idiot. :)
---
Agree, i expected bugs and issues moving forward from the beginning. But they need to have a real control on statements made to the public on ANY channel going forward and adhere to those statments made. Thats gonna be like the basic damage control plan i feel. They could do more but ive already probably overstated what they will do. Honestly, I just wanted this to be a good game. I dont even want to think about when the next entry into this IP will come so this is not a fun feeling.
---
Thank you! I didn't even see a notification?!
---
Poured through the Atomic Shop at least a half dozen times as well. W.T.F.?!
---
Yeah fair enough, but if any actual midget or dwarf is reading this I deeply I apologise. I wouldn't actually call a dwarf or midget a little person. I reserve that for people with little intellect, but I understand how someone else could misunderstand.
---
Thank you so much! I’ve been so busy with work I didn’t even remember there was an update and I have been so behind 😳
---
I get people are against the whole paid to win thing but I honestly can’t be bothered with these kits. And so far I’ve spent 20 bucks on the game and another 20 on atoms which is nothing for all the hours of fun I’ve had so far. Cheapest entertainment. A night out costs more...
---
I used marsupial and a jet pack to get up there, jumped across from the near by cliff and onto it, the back is just shallow enough of a slope to walk up normally until you get to the top
---
I mean, I quote the VP of the company stating that it will be cosmetic only. If the VP of the company isn't sufficiently "they" what the fuck is? 
---
Also, alt accounts? What the shit? I have one account. This one. It's many years old.
---
Allow me to spell it out in simple English.  When you sell a game for full price that is both unfinished and bug riddled, if you decide to spend more time populating the cash shop than bringing meaningful fixes and content, it’s going to drive players away.  The repair kits are just the straw that broke the glowing mole rats back.
---
don't worry, they'll add stash expanders to the atom shop with next update
---
It's barely a broken promise though. Repair kits impact nothing. They aren't game breaking, in fact they are pretty dang pointless.
---
Maybe the problem is they should have used better wording, but I don't see it as a betrayel nor will I stop playing a game I enjoy because some suckers MAY waste their atoms on repair kits which are absolutely useless
---
A lot of people probably already repair their items as the first thing they do when they hop on, so even if they get ambushed their weapons will still be in decent condition. Plus it’s not like you’re gonna get into a fight with one player for hours. Just kill them a couple times and leave or move on
---
And that attitude is why they keep breaking those promises.
---

" competitive advantage" I do not think those words mean what you think they do (directed at beth)
---
Shit my bad dude I just left the server cause it didnt have my house. I was going between Philipi  battlefield cemetary and Kelly's monument cause they are 2 Caps apart, and I was hoping servers for about an hour before finding her
---
There is a place where you can found 3 radscorpions everytime (or bees or yaoguai) ... no need to "hope"
---
And we had fun with friends to try to found it (we even put a gambling on the one who will found it first will win, everybody on the same server)
---
You hope because YOU want, not because you mast
---
I got a jetpack plan from the sbq
---
Alright Thank you will have to try it.
---
Who carries weapons back to camp? There are benches *everywhere*. Scrap the weapons in the field, stash whenever you pass train station or workshop or camp with accessible stash box, and repair at workbenches without having to carry duplicate weapons around.
---
This is the real reason people are mad. **Not the actual shitty repair kits.** 
---
Nerfing durability and then being able to "buy" your way out of a repair. How about giving more items when we scrap junk? How about requiring less materials to repair?  Nope, just buy a repair kit.  Especially annoying when people on the sub gave tons of positive feedback on the subject of the atom shop and what they want to see.
---
Bethesda just needs to flood the atom shop with cool stuff. Way more cool stuff than you could conceivably earn atom's in-game for.  They have so many assets in game that people want already.  Flags, faction stuff, weapons skins, etc.
---
I have been having the same experience. I'm relatively high level, have sentinel armor, quad explosive shotgun, and usually get taken out by players half my level. Although level in this game means nothing. Once you hit 50, everything is available and unlocked. I have every DR mod I can think of and I'm constantly getting two shotted.
---
I suppose we have a difference in opinion then? Im not so ok with pay for convenience or strategic advantage. Id rather everyone just gather materials and not be able to use their dollars to cut out grinding less well off players have to do. Why cant we all just play the same game?
---
Lol see my above post too lazy to retype
---
Big if true
---
I still miss having Idiot Savant though
---
Guess they were breaking the lore by existing in New vegas too then?
---
got it ?
---
This. For a while Acid weighed more because the weight of bulked was based on a bulk containing 15, but they only contained 10.
---
I haven't repaired my shit since december.
---
Anytime! Anything else just PM me. Fair warning it may take a while til I get back to ya. (I don’t have notifications on for this app)
---
I hope this has been enlightening for you.
---
Thank you, come again.
---
I'd rather see this than repair kits
---
Dont get me wrong here. If YOU are enjoying the game, then please by all means, keep playing it. Im not telling you not to, and I wouldn't want to try to convince you not to.
---
Ok dude. Yet again, you don't understand that slinging insults at everyone who disagrees with you is "offensive". 
---
That's your problem. Even if you take out discrimination against people with dwarfism out of it, there is now way you can write "I know most little people don't understand, " without it being offensive.
---
Yes but the skin always uses the X-01 model.  So even if you put that skin on T-45d Power Armor, it will just make it look like X-01 with the Plague paint.
---
That is why I am not a fan of the skin.  They should have just made it an X-01 exclusive and cut the price in half.
---
ok good ..
---
I'm sorry. I must have hallucinated several large patches with a myriad of bugs fixes and the recent new batches of content, and must have misheard that there was more coming.
---
It's almost comical how good the longevity of power armor and cores are. Even when the durability of heavy weapons was garbage I never had a point where I was totally fucked and couldn't repair anything. Because with proper planning you have backup weapons.
---
Your right but honestly I don’t believe a single post that says they are uninstalling the game and or never playing it again. 
---
Sure there might be one or two but the other 99%+ will continue to play even if Bethesda came out right now and said too bad, we lied. 
---
Also, why would any company listen to someone bad mouthing the company and developers who is also uninstalling the game all while bad mouthing their work? They wouldn’t. 
---
What we are missing here are people who wanted the kits... of course they won’t post since anything for repair kits gets downvoted into oblivion! lol
---
And?
---
You are not wrong there.
---
Look man, Idk what you are smoking but lets get something straight. It's a huge deal. Now I know this is why Jesus died, but until a few weeks ago. I was a good kid who had nothing but love in his heart and saw the world for what it really was, A wonderful place filled with kind,loving honest people who only want to do whats right for others. Than repair kits were mentioned and my life has been turned upside down. The fact that I could trust and to an extent love a for profit company the way I loved bethesda only for them to jam a knife in my back is, its criminal.
---
I've already contacted the SEC,the FCC and OSHA as well as venting my disgust on every forum. I have alot of free time and nothing better to do, This Franchise is my life! and for them to betray me, its so personal, its so deep. I no longer trust anyone my mom,dad, my dog. Nobody, They took my innocence, they took my youth. When Karen Sutherland asked if i wanted to ride bikes I said no and played fallout, when Kevin Maloney invited me over for chicken and stove top, I starved and stayed home playing fallout. They owe me. I've already paid to lose and I won't pay to win.
---
I added you. My GT is ResoluteSpark19. Feel free to join me anytime I'm on.
---
Not fixed 
---
Still can't apply mods to my pa even with the appropriate perks.
---
Thank you! Recieved ZERO notification; thought we got ripped off!
---
Ahh I see the tactic now
---
Then this is the point that needs to be made. Not "ItS P2w! FuCk BeThEsDa ReEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeE!!!!!!!!!"
---
Okay this is the first instance Ive heard where it would give you a real advantage. Personally think theyve made them affordable enough to qhere anyone can use this to their advantage though. Whether or not they spend money.
---
Seriously? Look at my downvotes then come back to me.
---
They look nice but I wouldn’t expect them to be available any time soon. If they are, it’ll be for 24 hours.
---
Unyielding armor. All 5 pieces give +3 to all stats except endurance.
---
Literally quitting the game because of this. Such bullshit!
---
Give us a chance to ride a Brahmin for fuck's sake, we already have provisioners load them up with chests and trunks and plenty of stuff heavier than us.
---
Well never mind about trying it then 😂
---
I edited my comment but here is the added part. 
---
&gt;Gear is a win mechanic, game completion is a win mechanic. Time savers skirt the line but are still convenience items and not win items. A win item would be damage buffs only purchasable from the store, a set of armor with bonus resistances, or a powerful tool.
---
You are playing the same game.
---
I swear to god I’ve checked 5000 times I cannot find where the repair kits are in the atom shop
---
I had it a while back and didn’t think it was great at all... maybe wrong cards... the dome key is also taken away for this dome once it’s open unlike the Nuka domes which allow you to keep the key.
---
No worries. I just appreciate the advice! I’m not great at this version of the game, but am enjoying it in my own way, so I have missed out on a lot.
---
This is why you don't make posts when you aren't sure of something.
---
By the time you come back, i'm gone and carrying all your junk away. I win. you lose. No matter what. 
---
You would have to be willfully dense or stubborn to not realize that.
---
All over, easiest I found is at bolton greens, if you on XB1 I am there now.
---
There's a separate entry for Flatwoods Monster.
---
Seriously, you have zero ground to stand on here, "the little people" what a fucking joke.
---
Do a search on here, many posts about this.
---
I found mine at Colonel Kelly Monument on the bench, just server hop.
---
There are so many things wrong with this game that we have no control, can't fix and are far more serious. Why ares so many  bitching about a problem  that is easily solved and we have complete control over? 
---
 If you think repair kits are terrible, don't buy them. Problem solved.
---
There's an event mission currently that costs 2,000 caps to trigger, and the event boss drops shit loot 9.9 times out of ten- that's if you are even able to loot her.
---
Often times you can't loot it because you can't find the corpse because it's invisible or possibly just gone, depending on whom you ask. I posted a thread about this and was down voted many times and was told  that I just wan't doing it right.
---
And yet there are threads posted hourly about trivial atom shop stuff that are getting massive amounts of thumbs up. I'm starting to believe this subreddit is a combination of  trolls who don't even play the game and sock puppet accounts of Bethesda employees.  Criticism concerning peripheral, trivial shit gets thousands of thumbs ups, but   whenever someone does talk about problems that are real and far more serious they get down voted.
---
XB1, lvl 58 - I won't be doing any photo challenges since they take up gallery space, but I do hope to get on soon enough to try out the photomode/emote transporting glitch!  I hope someone on PC will make a video so we can all experience it.
---
Are you close to reaching the camps budget? I notice more errors appear when my camp is almost at its max.
---
See you when the next mod drops, you might land then lol
---
I'm sorry. Is Pete Hines BGS? No. He's a mouth piece. 
---
He's not the entirety of BGS who announced it.... Clear as day.... As offering "No competitive advantage"
---
"Pete Hines said it! That supersedes the official announcement by the studio!"
---
Obnoxious.
---
Go to photo gallery, hide the UI, take a screenshot, share

**New findings:**
---
When you reload crouched, that +250 DR bonus **will last forever, until you stand up, or start shooting**. So that is kinda cool for moving around with huge DR ...

Wait I’m confused, what can people do with deathclaw gauntlets?  I haven’t been on in a while...
---
Im not being dense nor stubborn. Im just asking questions. Relax just a little bit.

Right on. Appreciate the infk. Thought my xbone, maybe my t.v. was fuckered up or something.
---
I have 2 reddit accounts. Draker isn't one of them. And I'm not even sure when the last time I logged into the other was but it wasn't today and wasn't to down vote you. In fact, I haven't down voted you at all but I can if you'd like to demonstrate that.
---
I did my first launch at level 40 or so, and it took for god damn ever, I died multiple times in the process, but at the end it was so satisfying to know I di-
---
I got disconnected from the server like 2 or 3 minutes after it touched down... but still, I had the satisfaction of doing it solo through sheer stubbornness! Took me like an hour and a half to launch only to get booted ;-;
---
Yeah I noticed that as well.
---
&gt; I'm missing the point and slippery slope and defending a multi million dollar company and all that jazz.
---
You kind of are. If you're inclined to pay-to-repair (and there are always some whales out there who will pay any amount for any advantage) then you can drop Gunsmith and/or Luck of the Draw because you no longer need the QoL improvement. In their place can go up to 8 perk cards that grant a tangible advantage.
---

Keep in mind the game has only been out for a few months. They're not going to make a "limited time item" available every few weeks. It probably wont be back for like a year. But it was a popular item and they know not everyone who wanted it got it, so it WILL be back eventually.
---
Yea they wanted it to be surprising is all! I was certainly surprised when I saw it
---
last i heard those run 1500-2000 caps. so doubt ya find anyone willing to part with one for 200 caps..
---
best bet if youre wanting one that cheap is to go to charleston station and start server hopping hoping you find the bot and that he has the coat to sell.
---
The bug where I jump instead of wiring two things has been worse lately. It used to be I'd just wire from the second item to the first, or worst case scenario have to back out and reopen the building menu. Now I'll spend five minutes jumping around and desperately trying to connect two pylons right next to one another.
---
Just to be fair, I wanted to kill most of my vault mates in the first 3 months.  The other 24 years and 9 months was careful planning.
---
Oh sorry sir. In what position would you like me sir?
---
I'm really only having fun with repair kit hater morons.
---
I've always maxed out my CAMP budget in the past and I've never had these issues before the last few weeks.
---
Lol I feel it! I got it when it came out, played it every chance I got for like 2 months. Took a month off, missed the cool Faschnacht parade stuff, came back and have been playing it non stop again. It’s a really good game, you can do whatever there’s no pressure. I’m a level 77 and have just gotten into like the second phase of the story arc.
---
&gt; Can we get an official response on why you've done some things and not told us?
---
Because you woudn't buy Todd's plastic whiskey bottles
---
Learned that one the hard way myself. Repeatedly..
---
Right.  As said in the OP, I have complete the questline, I *have* unlocked the lens.  I have it installed.  I even have the instructions on the bottom of the screen telling me which button is for zooming.  The problem is, that button *does not work*.  How do I zoom?
---
Yep, this is one of the same problems I'm having. Sometimes exiting out of the Workshop menu fixes it and sometimes it doesn't.
---
Wheres that one at?
---
Making workbenches more annoying makes repair kits more appealing.
---
~700 hours and I’ve yet to see protective or shielding casual or marine.  I’ve only got shielded raider once.
---
Wow only 80 for you? I’m missing like 160, the Forest is the only one that correctly completed for me
---
I’m not going anywhere but having these things changes the incentives.  It’s now in Bethesda’s best interest financially for repairs to be annoying or just irritating enough that I want to  pay to avoid it.  Instead of paying to do or add something fun to the game, I’m paying to avoid playing pets of the game. 
---
Is the game broken? No.  Nor do I have to rage quit. But it should not be dismissed as nothing.
---
I.Will.Never.Buy.Repair.Kits.
---
Kek.
---
This sounds kinda fun actually
---
They do seem to be making daily and weeklies harder to impossible. They went from "do Mama Dolche's" to "Brew 50 craft beers that require 18 of each type of flux per bottle, then drink them all and kill the sheepquatch while still drunk"
---
How is there PvP in a game mode that lets players attack and kill each other and each other’s property?
---
I’ll leave you to work that riddle out.
---
Yeah, every game should really integrate its bug reports into the game instead of a crappy website.  See Satisfactory (the game) for a perfect example.  As a person who's currently planning an online game himself, I definitely intend to keep that integrated into the game so there's no delay, no need to go to some website, no BS.
---
Even at the vendor bot, the coat costs somewhere around 700 caps so that ain't gonna happen either.
---
Repair kit give you a competitive disadvantage. Repair benches are everywhere. 200% durability and increased base damage, versus the "convenience" of not having to find a bench and saving a few mats. Nobody who wants to be "competitive" will be using basic repair kit.
---
Yea, like what do these pointy arrows mean?
---
lots of changes for the better. keep up the good work.
---
im not a fan of the repair kits in the cosmetic shop but the camera sounds fun.
---
Yes, I'm trying to get you to resolve your own contradictions by asking you to explain your position.
---
Only noobs carry excess junk in survival mode to begin with lol
---
Raider armor in sets in 3 and 4 were pretty ugly, like advanced ugly, only ones I liked were the maxed out pieces in 4 and the Forged armor.
---
So  your stance is that the vice president of the company, the person directly in charge of marketing and community out reach, the person who is, personally directly responsible for all information that is released about their games before they are released, is...irrelevant?
---
In this context, in the context of material and information provided about the game and specifically marketing decisions in this game, yes, _he is_ the fucking company. 
---
It's literally his job description.
---
I always send them as Feedback now, because I get the feeling those get read more often since they aren't required to reply to them all.  But I am definitely filling up quickly on frustration again with this system.
---
You don’t have to be a lawyer to know the difference between a contract you sign with a company for a service and what a game developer says they will or won’t put into the game. Maybe you should try hookedonphonics.com and read the terms of service of a game and try again.
---
I guess you just don’t get it.  For every gamer there is a BS threshold.  I hit mine.  Your threshold is clearly much higher than mine.  I’ve been around since pong was a new release so I actually know what it was like to buy a game that had a single digit amount of bugs.  So long as you can continue enjoying the content they push on you, more power to you.
---
Completely agreed. Hell, repairing has been a normal mechanic in the series from the get-go. Saying it's designed for mtx is just wrong.
---
I'm in the same boat missing out on atoms. So many unattainable. Some might say not much but we all earned them. We even went a while missing out on free atoms because the new camera was broken.
---
Yeah, definitely. No worries
---
Hey, you keep on data mining how else would this kind of information come to light. More information is never a bad thing.
---
1st centaur of the wastland
---
And you're using literal slurs to make that stance clear.
---
I noticed it will fix itself if you rejoin the world
---
Didnt remember original price on it had mine for a couple months now, just remember server hopping for like 5 hrs to find the bot, then getting friends down to it so we could take turns disconnecting and rejoining to get his inventory to change and took i think an hour of doing that to get mine to appear.. 
---
Was a major PIA
---
Ahh, got it - I was thrown by it saying "Improved magnification" instead of "*Any* magnification." Thanks!
---
... Which leads into a second issue of L2 aiming the camera and L1 zooming. Which are controlled by the same finger. Sigh.
---
You joking right, we get crumbs in the amount of atoms, Bethesda is tight when it comes to atoms .... take this nonsense somewhere else, I don't think we get nearly enough opportunities to earn atoms like other games. Take GTA Online for instance, I can grind all night for in game currency if I wanted, yes it is still a grind, but you can still earn currency. Here once you finished the challenge, you done and once you finished the other challenges, it's once only, it's limited at best.
---
Bethesda is into a shady practise with this time limited time item BS and limited ways to actually earn atoms .. 
---
Lots of people buy atoms .. but some of us never will as we don't support micro transactions period ...
---
I will never buy Atoms period ..
---
Buying op gear from other players is more of an advantage than repair kits.
---
It doesn't matter what the majority of us on Reddit do, or even the majority of actual players. There are whales out there who individually out-spend the lower 90% of the player base.
---
You can't vote this kind of problem away with your wallet. Some other pressure is needed to force the industry from exploiting a few individuals and damaging the experience for the rest of us in the process.
---
Not enough time to find players to do hunter/hunted.
---
I don't expect many people to actually uninstall over this either, but what worries me is the direction it shows them taking.
---
At best it shows a willingness to try to make money on the back of the bits of the game that people don't enjoy. At worst it incentivises them to actively make poor design choices to fix them in a similar way. Such as Atom shop bought weightless food/drink/ammo.
---
Clipping?! \*cries in fashion\*
---
What is ban-able about it? I know you shouldn’t be able to use unarmed weapons in PA, but PA sucks in PvP. It’s not like it’s a crazy OP glitch like the invisibility one.
---
It is, i tried waving with the camera and i shot to the other side of new gad
---
Youtubers are always going to go after controversial content, its what they do to get viewers.  You can't get a realistic measure of dissatisfaction or satisfaction from YouTube.  According to VGChartz FO76 had a little over 2 million sold copies.  I have no idea how accurate that figure is, but its probably closer to reality than my guess.  No idea how many complainers there are, but if you look at the number of subscribers on this forum and look at the number of complaint posts it pretty low so proportionally still a small number, even if you consider other channels.
---
It's like nukashine minus the nukashine
---
How can you carry significantly more without calibrated power armor or calibrated, weight bugged excavator?
---
I can’t say for sure as I don’t have a PA build, other posts seem to suggest calibrated shocks aren’t behaving as they should though
---
"Nuke Briefcase
---
NukeBriefcaseInactiveActivateMessage
---
The briefcase is sealed shut.
---
NukeBriefcaseActiveActivateFailMessage
---
The printer isn't responding."
---
that's probably what your thinking of, and that does go along with the picture. very strange.
---
My opinion, if you don't want low levels to join, don't start it on a server full of low levels.
---
SBQ is a public event and drops some of the best items.
---
Expect everyone on the server to join.
---
Don't want low levels?
---
Join a server with majority high levels.
---
Good idea, then the game that we obviously enjoy to some extent will shut down.
---
&gt;  shouldn't this be bannable?  
---
Why would you think that?  He's able to use the gauntlet in power armor, so he probably assumes that's how they game is supposed to work. Why wouldn't he?
---
You don't need to look so much into the definition of the word. 
---
There are two relevant facts in this case.
---
1)Repair kits in the atom shop are not "pay to win".
---
2) Bethesda has broken their promise of atom shop items being "cosmetic only".
---
However that makes you feel is fine and that is your right to feel that way. Those are the facts.
---
Still is an advantage over other players which break their ToS.
---
It's this way for me all the time!
---
I would love this, I'd love camps to be more interactive in general. Like, a letterbox where you can send letters or parcels.
---
That’s good news then :)
---
With 200% repair and adrenal reaction mutation, mine does 114 damage.
---
These people who go on about this remind me of late night commercials were the people are so inept that they fumble the most inane tasks.
---
No matter how much you people want to act like this is some sort of game breaking thing, it's not. Simply because of the menu. If you're in a menu trying to repair your shit, that gives me an opening to kill you, steal your shit, perhaps eat your corpse while your on your knees as a flex while you sit there looking for a place to respawn. All because you paid bethesda 50 atoms for something that's going to get you killed in a PVP situation.
---
This is some of the greatest feedback I've seen on the sub. Leaving short messages would also be a great way to bring more life to CAMPs.
---
We also have major issues with the gatling plasma/laser that is new (not this patch but the previous) that are ridiculous and make heavy energy weapons extremely hard to use. 
---
If you have partial cores in your inventory, you will prematurely run out and have to reload. Once you reload, you do one shot and will NOT shoot again till you respool. Once you respool, again if you have more partial cores, you will deplete prematurely over and over. Also I've noticed that randomly while fighting mobs, you will spool up and not fire at all. I have no idea what triggers this other than when you are fighting mobs. The most ive had this happen to me in a row is like 3 or so times. 
---
These things are very crucial to us heavy energy guns users. We cannot efficiently use our weapons in big events like the encryptid events or SBQ let alone any nuke zones when we are faced with enemies left and right. Unfortunately, energy weapons has always been on the bottom of the list for Bethesda. Something needs to change.
---
Oh yeah, for sure. I've met Brits, Germans, Dutch, Frenchmen, Norwegians, Russians, Americans, Koreans and Italians. I've also met people speaking Spanish but it'd be impossible for me to tell from where they were.
---
Is pretty obvious that if you are in power armor you can't use it , and if he is able to keep doing it means he is abusing a glitch or a not intented feature in the game.
---
FUCK YOU, BETHESDA. SHAME ON YOU FOR GOING BACK ON YOUR PROMISE AND INTRODUCING P2W TO FO76. I was willing to come back to the game, but you’ve completely destroyed any motivation to come back.
---
Where in Camden could it be?
---
Come on Bethesda! Fix the damn flamer!
---
Just F.Y.I., everyone who got the coat from the vendor spent **hours** before they got the item, and then it also cost them 800 caps to buy it. I have one extra, and I'm willing to sell it for 2000 caps (or a good trade offer).
---
Has the technical data been removed from the WS bunker? I was just there so thought I'd grab one but there were none in any of the desks
---
shut up already
---
The plasma version is all fuckered up as well. My furious gatling plasma not only sets the number of rounds in the currently loaded core to the total number of cores I have, EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. I swap weapons, now when I first fire it up it makes the sound, and reduces the round count - without firing the round, (visually and no effect on target). I have to stop and then wind it back up again for it to actually work. *sigh*
---
So I made sure I logged in everyday and I get to craft a broke ass dirty bunnyhead. Which has what to do with a death claw may I ask? We are not all kids sleeping in racecar and princess beds. The eggs are cool though..
---
Go to toxic Larry’s meat n’ go near Berkeley springs and look for the holotapes in the building and at a camp site directly down from the cabin.
---
I haven't heard anything yet and I'm looking through reddit and YT for new things.
---
Sorry, Pc :p
---
It's not clear to me. If you tell me your race I can use a more appropriate slur. I will need photographic evidence though.
---
Seriously is this what this has come to? Lies about slurs because you have no argument?!
---
I asked for help and I had just hit 100 lol I don’t give a fuck.
---
It's your user flair. Look in the menu for this sub.
---
What do you mean by 'you people' and why are you taking this so personally?
---
I get that. And agree now it is a convenience but I get the feeling that soon they will raise the necessary cost of just the vanilla repair. So that the game is more repair than doing quests. I don't want that.
---
Add me on PSN: Heirmes
---
And in my opinion if it sells like hotcakes it will lead to decisions that impact our playability at the possibility of them making money off of a decision they make about durability of items.  I don't think it is any coincidence that foods degrade much quicker now then after release of the game.  Same for other things.  It's not like users were asking for that, so my guess is they hope to tweak things just enough so they can get people to spend more money on the game.  While pushing the least amount of users away.   I personally would never.  I won't even spend my free earned atoms on this or anything they introduce to the atom store moving forward that falls into this "convenience" category, that is based on things they have adjusted durability to influence the purchase.
---
Is plague rider the only one of the four horsemen out now? Or are they all in a bundle? And how much is it? I can't get on to check right now
---
Nothing more entertaining than angry gamers on Reddit amiright or amiright
---
Today I learned that I am a true asshole.
---
TLDR:
---
Having exactly same problem w/my gatling plasma..
---
What's yours? 
---
Also 
---
1. I really only want Crimson Flux
---
2. The baton is sold, but I still most of the other things, look and see if you want anything 
---
3. Are you on tonight?
---
&gt; Is pretty obvious that if you are in power armor you can't use it
---
Not obvious at all because he is using it.
---
Idk I just felt like I had to say that
---
By the way I don't believe you even actually play the game, so I'll need evidence of that. Steam key, PS4 key etc. Your choice.
---
It is, except i just crashed the game lmao
---
More importantly, why didn’t most of us age at all?
---
Maybe also send me a dick pic. No reason, I just might enjoy it.
---
yes AtomicQuotient
---
It’s just the one as of now and it’s 1400 atoms
---
I can just hear David Attenborough or Steve Irwin narrating this.
---
"the little people" dude. Stating you've used a slur isn't a lie.
---
You can earn at least around a vanity item (of your choice, no rng) every week, through fairly typical gameplay. That is really pretty good. 
---
I don't have GTA online experience, but in many games cosmetics = you pay. I typically spend very little or zero, but games get supported by half the "whales" who buy every single microtransaction that comes out, and half by people who make the odd purchase. 
---
Right now, I personally would never buy atoms, because I don't see real money purchase of them as having much value.
---
I like it actually, it means players will be able to wear the coolest paints even if the armour it's attached too isn't too good.
---
When you say "transformed" is that just a visual thing or did the stats change when you applied the skin to other types of power armor?
---
Duck off
---
Thanks! Found her on my first jump!
---
This is a great idea.
---
While that's a reasonable viewpoint, there are other things you can spend atoms on that would have the same effect of maintaining the viability of the game.
---
Cool, thank you. Is it limited time?
---
...wait, you're asking for a _steam key_ and you're saying _I_ don't play the fucking game?  That's fucking hilarious.
---
Can I see?
---
Last question: do you recommend going to a location and then just server hopping? Or visiting them all on one server
---
WHUT?!? BETTER CUCKING NOT BE!$@$!
---
Well it definitely does not mean cosmetic only. 🤷‍♀️
---
Thank you joining now
---
Yeah, that's no way to honor The Dude, the Dudeness, the Dudenero...
---
I just honestly thought for the price, it was a tailored skin for each set. Oh well.
---
 Don't tell me how to live my life.
---
Must just be bad luck - mine is working like normal
---
I have an issue with the kits only because they said cosmetic items only and that was a part of my decision to preorder and buy the game. If they said cosmetic items and repair kits I probably wouldn't care. I still wouldn't buy them because I'm always happy to reduce my hoard but I wouldn't feel as deceived.
---
Yeah do a mathematician
---
Or you can not even bother with either of those perks in the first place as I do because if you just walk 15 feet in this game it will literally just give you the mats to repair your stuff.
---
Im assuming they will hot fix this lol
---
Can someone post an image of what we're looking for?
---
I think so, I bought the skin and before I bought it, I believe it said 6days. The timer disappears after you buy something
---
Yeah, at least it works for each suit. They're going to release one for each type.
---
I still haven't found one yet. I've just been visiting them all on one server. Traveled to about five so far and no luck. I'm starting to think hopping at one location will be the best bet.

Sent request
---
It's a glitch So what? You're a tool for trying to get someone banned over finding a mistake. He didnt create it. Maybe spend more time playing the game than watching what others do.
---
My suggestion is they make items available and keep them available. There are several items and skins that I would have bought but missed because I was working and not able to play before they pulled them :-/
---
Stay there I'm on my way
---
Sweet, as long as it's not 24 hours like the play time sale I'm fine with it. Thanks
---
I can only get that to work 10% of the time on console
---
Let me talk to my buddy and see what he says
---
Fallout 76 _isn't on steam_ dude.
---
It’s almost certainly not true that they weakened them. But now that it’s in their financial interest to do it, there will always be questions.
---
I physically curled into a ball of laughter reading this. Thank you for the satire
---
TUEBOR Michigander ;-)
---
LvL 93 but will keep an eye out for ya!
---
What are you willing to trade
---
Oh my fucking god when will you guys learn that these guys will **never** respond like this?
---
1. They have no influence on the upper management of the company, which include the people who decide to implement paid repair kits
---
2. They are PR representitives. It is literally in their job to **avoid** commenting on negative shit like this. Especially when tagging them.
---
I assume they change back when you change paint. I have it on my X0-1 atm, haven’t tried it on my others.
---
especially the yellow fisherman outfit, they make the ugliest choices when it comes to clothes like why are the shoes untied and pants rolled up on the t shirt and jeans why couldnt it just look good
---
I never said that? I just said this isn't a big deal. The promise was way too ambitious.
---
You got it ?
---
cosmetically, or functionally? Does it get x-01 stats and need x-01 mods, or??
---
I tend to agree with the amount of atoms. If Bethesda wants to monetize things, fixing the atoms would be a good start vs. putting things in that gives boosts or these repair kits. People can disagree all they want but it’s insanely easy to earn atoms. For those who say it slows down when you break 50, I call bs. I was able to get over 3000 on my 380 just by doing random crap. Not even purposely trying to get atoms. If you aren’t buying everything on the market and only going for those rare occasions when something nifty comes out, atoms aren’t an issue.
---
What they could do, so it appeases those who want the same flow of free atoms is make two kinds for two stores. Free ones can buy good skins and cosmetics, while paid has better looking cosmetics.
---
But to be honest, even that won’t get good reviews. There’s to many spoiled brats out there that cling on free stuff and complain that they want an easier game. For example. All of the ranged players that complain and say melee needs to be nurfed. My response is, I sure wish I had a bloody explosive deathclaw gauntlet with attack speed. Pvp servers proved my point. Look how many ranged sit in chameleon and expect to one shot every player. I officially have both types of characters and I can say, using strategy and some decent gear, my ranged is way more OP than my 380 melee. The fact that you can rip through trash mobs like nothing, vats crit and hit from insane ranges and so forth is enough for me to say what I said. 
---
You can’t please everyone. This is oddly a well balanced game in my opinion. Bethesda, even though I dislike them right now for the repair kits, did a good job so far on the game and hand out A LOT of free stuff to players. So much that I believe it’s enabling childish behavior and spoiled brat syndrome.
---
Now I got a new set to strive for.
---
I'm making fun of you. You do realise you're getting very upset over an item in a game, which you're not even playing, and isn't even as egregious as the stuff that you already accept?
---
As I said, I'm just playing with you. You're fun.
---
 Repair kits are p2w. that is a fact, like it or not.
---
Pay to Win has never been a solely pvp term.
---
Having  a quick repair option for if your gear breaks in any of the games  dungeons or raids is an advantage over having to leave back to your camp  or to find a workbench.
---
Can we get the option to tie menu screen music to the music slider under sound? 
---
Can we get an separate control knob for holotape volume or at least tie it to radio or something?
---
Can we get the option to modify some of inventory control hot keys? Things like examine item, drop item, use stimpak, use radaway, etc. I've accidentally dropped my primary weapon quite a few times because "R" is mapped to drop which is right next to "T" which brings me to the perk menu. Luckily, I've realized each time and picked the item back up immediately...
---
I'll take the coat for 2 k
---
ty sir your are a gentleman and a scholar.
---
Mine works
---
Your armor breaking in a fight wouldn't happen if you just repaired your armor to 200% and used the white knight perk.
---
Oh sorry, I recently closed game. :(
---
Dude, I'm just sitting here pointing out that the tantrum you're throwing is bullshit. I'm not "upset".
---
i don't have all the time in the world to play so when i don't i like keeping up with updates or gameplays etc. I just think is unfair thats all. Didn't you see how they banned all the other people for duping? How is this any different?
---
I'm not talking about just youtube, or just this subreddit. That is the point you seem to be missing, I'm going by the overall reaction from everywhere about this. To only take info from one source like reddit, or youtube, or the official forums won't give you the full picture, that is why I prefer to check around many different places.
---
OK, cool.  Normally I would chalk it up to bad luck but these patches... oi.
---
I'll be here until 730 unless this dude despawns or disconnect
---
I'm not interested in marine armor because  I prefer the aesthetics and stats of  heavy raider or heavy combat.
---
My pleasure
---
How is it obvious? (Maybe I'm oblivious.)
---
sometimes i can't even spawn because i get instantly killed by someone camping the spawn points...
---
I'm sorry you're so upset
---
Why would he game place us in servers that we won’t have low ping in? Not really complaining, just wondering.
---
Yeah, but that one was worth 20 atoms, if you leveled up during the sheepsquatch fight that is...
---
There has got to be a Texas joke in here somewhere
---
I have 8c/16t CPU, 16GB of DDR4 3200Mhz, Samsung SSD, and load is pretty much as you described. This mess is not "Only on Playstation", pun very intended :) 
---
I load into a frozen state, sometimes, like the game is about to crash or something. And keep in mind, we're not actually controlling our character, but we're already there, taking damage, radiation, both, whatever.
---
We're already game while game is still loading for us, that's the worst part.
---
This is simple. They said only cosmetics, BUT then the game flopped. They need extra revenue to continue supporting it. And this is a harmless way to do it.
---
Maybe an end of year anniversary sale event?
---
trading between players is part of the game.
---
If you are talking about players that sell items for cash on ebay and such, that is beyond bethesda's control. No company (even blizzard) has been able to stop it without making things simply untradeable.
---
I think banning people is a little much in this case. Sounds more like the dev's need to fix it. I know you, "can't" wear your armor while in power armor. I also know that at seemingly random times when entering my power armor I retain perks and stat buffs from the armor I am wearing. They randomly show as equipped or not, regarlde3of the perk and stats applying. I don't play PvP, am I supposed to stop playing because I keep playing when it happens?
---
No, it’s still there.
---
Sometimes spawns, sometimes doesn’t. But I was there earlier post patch and found some just fine :)
---
&gt;That is the point, they won't have to put 5 points into intelligence
---
Who *doesn't* have points in intelligence? Almost every build requires intelligence. Intelligence is where all the crafting shit is. It's where all the power armor perks are. It's an important stat in basically every build involving a gun or power armor.
---
&gt; how often the 1 use repair kits she has will drop. You aren't going to be having tons of those laying around.
---
Ah fuck now all my weapons will break. Oh wait, no they won't. Because they're at 200% and break so slowly it's not an issue.
---
if you get in the power armor it wont let you use is simple as that.
---
This community is like 5% of players and most of us are like minded already. The people you think you're reaching out to aren't even here. They've never been here. They're busy playing so much that they'd spend their hard earned money on the game.
---
Not with the way they are going with challenges, last week they had 4 challenges that were impossible to complete, now the challenges they have out now are almost impossible on consoles due to having a max of 50 pictures you can take, and the challenges requiring 30. So you have to micromanage your pictures on consoles a LOT.
---
It also really shouldn't matter how cheap they are, the fact they do give an advantage and can be bought with real money is an issue.
---
The jet pack definitely would have made things a hell of a lot easier but i'm not really a Power Armour person myself. 
---
You should try top of the world if you haven't already. Even with marsupial it was too high for me, but with a jet pack you might just stand a chance.
---
Hah I laughed at this cause its true. Funny part is I never complained, but I did quit.
---
Before Wild Appalachia there was some patches and I was just like...... Nope not happening, and never downloaded them. So I just stopped playing.
---
Any new Vaults open? High Level Dungeons? I heard about new enemies but that's not what I meant in regards to dungeons.
---
Arm chair developers are the best
---
Fallout 76 vanishes and in its place a game emerges called Fallout 5.  It takes place in West Virginia and it's an online-only experience where vault-dwellers emerge from ~~Vault 76~~ Vault 5 on Reclamation Day.  
---
Please look forward to Fallout 6, 10 years from now.
---
it was just an example lol but yeah I get what your saying lol
---
Had the camera equipped while I stepped on a Mine. 
---
I went from the top of the world to Whitesprings, so uhhh fast travel is now free.
---
True you never said that but you might as well have. A promise is never too ambitious it doesn't matter if a person made one or a company made one. The point is they gave us their word and with the trust they gained from us their fans we took them at their word. They betrayed the trust of their fans and broke their word. Why should they be given any benefit of the doubt? If they lie about this and no one has a problem with it, what will they lie about in the future.
---
dude point is they said no non cosmetic dont
---
got both my characters in and out quick as i could and camera and quest on both of em.. again ty.
---
I have it. You can apply it to all Power armors, but it will still make your power armor look like X-01 model. What a lazy piece of shite item this is. Looks cool tho
---
Correct.  But it's still bad.
---
This is all an experiment.  It starts with something dumb that makes no sense or useful purpose, and then a month later, they add something that actually does make sense, and because people were okay with the last one, Bethesda figures people won't care if it goes a little further.
---
That dungeon area seems to always be vacant of players now. I would rather just farm Whitesprings and WesTek or Harpers Ferry. Usually skip the dungeon now.
---
Skins only go so far. Especially when the ingame items already look so cool. The community isn't being reasonable about why they need a new monetization route.
---
Awesome, hadn’t heard of that so thank you!!
---
Thats what actually spurred me to get a jet pack to bw honest, was still too high, id have to do the stck power armor trick to gain more height
---
No problem at all, you have a good one.
---
Exclusive gun damage... You know, similar to twisted talons.
---
Stats stay the same. Just a visual change
---
It counts for both, like Players and Humans do for the Social Challenge.
---
Cool, thank you!
---
Your Raider flair fits your personality. Stupid.
---
I have an explosive lever action pimped out, (night vision scope, suppressor, modded barrels, magazie, and stock, LvL 50). Believe it's a 3 star as well; will check in a few.
---
What's a rifle like that worth?
---
I’m just waiting for a marine combat armor skin.
---
Cosmetically
---
Yes lol
---
But it's part of the game, and I still support your decision to play how ever you want to play.
---
Rad, thanks! 😃
---
'a lot' and 'probably' aren't exactly the comprehensive terms needed to backup the idea that this problem can't happen. :-p
---
If it happens, it happens. Dancing around it won't change that. Repair kits do interact with competitive gameplay and can influence the outcome of an engagement, that's just a fact at this point. Doesn't mean it's some big P2W, but it does mean that Bethesda are basically blowing smoke out of their arses when they claim the cash shop won't have things that affect competitive gameplay. It doesn't matter if it's some guy who forgot to repair his gun or whatever, the only important point is that someone can end up winning a fight due to those kits, and it's not some far-fetched scenario that could never happen. With thousands of players it *will* happen.
---
that's a cool screenshot! you know there is an option to remove the background blur? i wonder how much nicer this pic would be if we can actually see everything.
---
What are all ranged weapons. That I can scrap 20 of them
---
76 flopped hard. They need money for the FREE updates. Quick repairs is a harmless way to do so.
---
It's so depressing reading these overly ambitious suggestions from people that very, very obviously have no experience modding or knowledge of this engine.
---
"Just put mounts in! skyrim had mounts, and it's on the creation engine, so therefore you can just slap mounts into fallout 76 easily! No issues, no server lag"
---
Don't waste your money. I have it on a SSD, tried my HDDs in RAID, it doesn't matter, it's the game.
---
For guns its a plan you learn thats pretty garbage
---
Basically what I saw was "Your opinions mean jack shit to us. Give us money."
---
lol. Seriously?  It has it's own category.  Very bottom.
---
An easier way to make money is to sell purley cosmetic items that people actually want.
---
Any side quests to this bucket list?
---
I mean, I'll probably buy it.
---
Anyone on ps4 have him right now? Jumped for the last 40 minutes same spot and nothing
---
Same. Nothing happened to me and cannot do nothing with the camera
---
These sound like latency issues to me.  Probably has more to do with your home network, or distance from the closest server.  If you live in Antarctica or something you'll just have to deal, otherwise do the usual home network troubleshooting.  Play on a wired connection, disable wifi on all unused devices, etc.  Also make sure your modem and router are getting proper air flow.
---
My phone can somehow stop the entire network when it decides to update, so keep devices like that in mind.
---
World is full currently.  But you're awesome for posting.  My buddy has been hoping for over an hour trying to find him.
---
TSE weapons are still really good if your build doesn't suck.
---
Nope. The issue isn't the "free atoms". It's the absolute lack of quality content to spend those atoms on, combined with exploitative limited time "specials" on the few rare quality paint jobs and cosmetic items that come through the shop. 
---
Now, you've got this absolutely unacceptable non-cosmetic shit coming in, making the Pete Hines word completely garbage, which is...another problem. 
---
Frankly, one issue is that it's a very large amount of atoms to unlock an item you're going to use once. They'd do better if they had everything stay available, charged less for it, but it could only be used _once_. 
---
Say you really like the blackbird paint, and you want a full set. Instead of..what was it, 1800 atoms? I don't know, I've never _seen it for sale_. (which is _fucking stupid_ , bethesda, ditch the pay to win shit and put blackbird in the shop and I'd buy atoms to buy it today).  Instead, you charge...200 per painted piece. 
---
So if you just want the blackbird helmet, its' cheap. You want a full set, you're out 1000 atoms. You want a second set? It's another thousand atoms. 
---
Paints and skins, if it was a _from the start_ thing, could have been one time things, for much less...so if you want to fully outfit multiple characters in the same gear, you spend more, over-all.
---
If this is happening a lot to you, and you don’t have the TNT dome keys, you can use this glitch to get in.
---
Not that the dome keys are hard to get these days, but still.
---
Thank you, good night! :)
---
For ballistic weapons, it's done by adding the scorched killer mod.  For melee, it's by adding the sacrificial mod to machetes.
---
They DO. and it isn't generating enough revunue. The playerbase simply isn't big enough, or already satisfied with the skins they have.
---
Ryzen 2700X, 16GB DDR4 3200Mhz, Samsung SSD, GTX 1080. I have the same problem. Every time I log in.
---
I feel you. They always mess something up lol
---
No you sap potato I say tomato
---
There are only two ways currently to add *’s to weapons. For ballistic weapons to can add a scorched receiver mod that you can buy in the fire station. The other way is  by adding the sacrificial blade mod to a machete.
---
I think GTA and Rockstar have a good model, they don't come across as tight or cheap, they have sharkcards that are heavily promoted, but they also give you countless opportunities to earn in game currency. Every mission, every quest, everything in the game earns you money. For the people that don't have time to grind, shark cards are there. This gives a good impression that they not solely tight and trying  to limit you earning in game in game currency.
---
On the other hand Bethesda is clearly limiting us with only a few dailies and weeklies and and outside of those challenges, you can't earn currently Also they have purposely  made challenges more tedious and more difficult and impossible to do to limit us even further. Some challenges such as rad storms are impossible to do and they know it, but they keep putting them in, to the stupid pvp hunter vs hunted challenges where only the winner gets the atoms, if you never win you never get atoms.
---
It is absolutely despicable what Bethesda are doing and the way they doing it and not to mention the BS camera challenges from last week and the refusal to hot fix it to correct the impossible challenges. But even some of those challenges are total BS, such as take picture of a player in PVP or take a picture of a player in a outfit fighting the Mirelirk Queen, they making these challenges literally impossible and tedious to the point people are not going to want to do.
---
And the limited sales to buy brand new items is shade af, the limited PA paints to force people to spend real dollars is so shady, I just shake my head it is pathetic and very disappointing to see Bethesda stooping to this incredibly low levels to make some money. I never will buy toms out of principle because of these shady practices ..
---
I have it on my server. On PC IGN wheeldogz. At the miners monument
---
You are basically the same level. You can’t use anything better at level 19 than at level 15. Kinda sounds like one of the rare fair fights.
---
As far as Stats go, max level T-51b will have the highest Damage *AND* Energy Resistance (454 Each), along with the worst Radiation Resistance (305) of all Power Armor.
---
Meanwhile X-01 will almost match it's Energy Resistance (453) at the highest value and have the highest Radiation Resistance (453) of all Power Armor.
---
Ultracite will have almost the same Damage Resistance as T-51b (453) and a Radiation Resistance that falls between X-01 and T-51b (393)
---
T-60 doesn't have stats as high as those, but still has good stats (400 DR/370 ER/415 RR) and is considered the best balance of "Cheap to repair vs Damage mitigation"
---
T-45 and Raider can't really hold a flame to those four (They still have higher Radiation Resistance than T-51b though), and while it has fairly low stats, Excavator armor has the benefit of increasing Carry Weight by 100, but you need to be wearing a complete set.
---
Unless you're REALLY hurting for Radiation Resistance or can't get the supplies to maintain it, T-51b outshines the others.
---
Theres some mod that you get the plan for during the main story that gives extra damage to scorched. I've seen posts about it adding a star but I never felt like trying it. Is not really worth it to me
---
The jumping bug for attaching wires. I think the fix is use only one method/button either use space for attaching oe E not a combination.  I just use E and it seems to work okay.
---
The caps reset 20 hours after you sell an item. Other players aren't a factor.
---
Do you mean the glitch where we couldn’t add mods or was there a specific calibrated shocks mod glitch?
---
Try selling 1 item to a vendor if it says 0. Sometimes it then resets it back to the actual amount.
---
That would make sense... Someone just mentioned though that a "workaround" is to just buy another console, because the images don't seem to be shared between different ones on the same account. That would imply they are stored locally.
---
I can actually check this later on.
---
But doesnt rad away usually cure the mutation?
---
I will try to tame two deathclaws with my friend to join Hunter/Hunted with us. I hope it works. :!
---
Lastnight in Whitespring, my first time there, I attempted to access a terminal and got stuck. Had to close the game completely and log back in. Ended up happening 4 times at different terminals before I gave up.
---
I noticed that I load in and the world loads, but then 30-60 seconds goes by and the world changes. Loot that was there disappears. NPCs load in 60+ seconds after I'm already walking around interacting with the world and moving into new areas.
---
I've also noticed that any I'm in my camp when I login, my campfire is apparently hostile and all of my turrets shoot at it endlessly. Occasionally one turret loads in hostile as well and gets destroyed by the others.
---
Caps are connected to each player and aren't shared.  So if there's no caps, you sold your limit.   Wait 20 game hours.
---
Do I hear you talking to yourself, buddy? :-p
---
Agreed! That's my point really. They will only care if it effects their pocket books.
---
I actually looked at the second image after I commented. After seeing it I kinda felt what you were going for. Thanks for sharing!
---
They’re too busy avoiding everyone.
---
Caps aren't shared by everyone, the vendors have 1400 for you alone.  If it's displaying zero just sell a one cap item and it'll refresh their total to the correct amount.
---
...how do you unlock that keg, anyway, a random biv reward?
---
Not really i didnt stop playing when everyone was duping , etc. I played the game since day 0
---
No problem. Glad you liked it.
---
Thanks man
---
No, items still cycle in and out of the inventories of vendors.  There seem to be a huge number of reliable plans, though, and in general your odds of finding a specific plan are astronomically higher.
---
But vendors still have different stuff on different days.
---
Reading this hurt my brains.
---
If your weapons and armor break to the point of you having to back out of an event or what not, you're playing the game wrong. Aside from maybe scorchbeast queen and silo run, you should not be worried about breaking your shit. 
---
It's a convenience item, it's not pay to win.
---
They also fixed the friendlist.
---
I never once said any if that actually...I simply stated that if those things were in previous games that ran on the same engine, than, why couldnt we eventually be given mounts in the newest gsme thats on the same engine
---
And dont tell me I dont know anything blah blah blah because the same exact glitches that were happening in fallout 4 are identically happening in FO76...so if they can copy paste code and call it a whole new game, why cant they just copy and paste code to let us fucking ride something?
---
Thanks for the condescending comment tho asshole
---
\&gt; What do you mean by 'you people' 
---
People like the OP and yourself. That have such a problem with this. Literally the only problem with this exact thing is that they said the atom shop was only going to have cosmetic shit, and then they put this in. That's it. 
---
It's not pay 2 win, because, as i demonstrated like twice already, you still have to go through the menu to actually repair your shit and by the time you've done that, I've already killed you, stolen your shit, and gone off to find another victim to do the same exact thing to. Not only that but it's a waste of atoms simply for that exact reason. It's making a mountain out of a molehill when you should be focusing on the fact that they actually changed what they said they were going to do. 
---
\&gt; why are you taking this so personally? 
---
Because ever since this game was announced, from the second the first trailer ended, this fanbase, along with people like yongyea, has been using it as a lynchpin to shit all over bethesda and other people that happen to like the game with shit that really doesn't matter in the long run. 
---
Shit like this "repair kits are P2W!" fiasco or the "ThEy DiDn'T sAy ThE rUm WoUlD bE iN a PlAsTiC cAse!" (when you literally could find images of the nuka dark rum, without it being in a promotional image like the one on its site, long before it actually released) or the thing where people were screeching about that duper being banned a few months ago. All of it comes off as disingenuous.
---
Good explosive weapons I don't already have. ;-)
---
what about a double flusher? double the carry weight... 🤔
---
Is it the scope?
---
Hmm if they are goinna pull this they should have done the same for the bone excavator armor
---
Oh I know man, and I'm not trying to be mean or argumentative either. But I saw that you chose to quit playing when they made the announcement, so I was just trying to figure out your viewpoint on why it such a hard betrayel.
---
Because to me, I've had real world experiences and have learned to have a thicker skin, and thus when they said "cosmetics only" I was immediately like yeah cosmetics and probably some other crap that doesn't effect gameplay too much nor is pay to win. I mean Pete Hines has said that, and I trust the guy honestly.
---
They wouldn't survive the absolute shit storm that would ensue if they had loot boxes or you could buy things that actually affected the games.
---
In my opinion repair kits arent even as game changing as a cosmetic item, because they are LITERALLY useless. At least cosmetics from the atom shop can give me joy or make my camp look good. Repair kits don't do a thing, because I'll never buy one.
---
Anyways sorry for rambling, just trying to make a point, but you do you bud.
---
It's better to just not login at all until they remove them from the shop. I have a million other games to play.
---
From what i've read on this reddit, dataminers say it's a weekly challenge that haven't been unlocked yet, but I have no idea.
---
The terminal to open the door is gone
---
They aren't supposed to unless you're using the unique pearly peepers.
---
Hey....BEAR FUCKER
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Where is he usually located
---
I like the repair kits I already bought a 6 pack ;-)
---
Gotta give an up vote for this.  When you step off from the moral outrage (most can't) of being lied to by a competitive, multi-billion dollar company that sells a product that you bought, then you get all this crap.  I cannot see this as a game changer for anyone. I see these as a convenience, not a competitive edge.  The only people pushing that narrative are the delusional PVP players who blame their lack of skill on everything except that; their lack of skill,  or the pseudo intellectual crowd that troll this forum looking to teach morals through hyper vocabulary.
---
So I had to reloaded and went and refound a tourist and relistened tonthe holotape and it worked. Pain in the ass, I know!!
---
This will probably get down votes but it’s clear now that 76 is all about trying to get decent income while spending the least amount of money in the game as possible.
---
This!  Take all my upvotes!
---
&gt;I'll definitely never need to use them. Not even remotely.
---
If they don't sell enough in the Atoms shop, I'm convinced that armor and weapons will just start breaking more and more frequently with subsequent updates.
---
I honestly don’t care about the repair kits, if you want to waste a couple bucks instead of searching for components (takes literally 5-10mins) then that’s you. As for the update my camp spawns in almost immediately after joining a server.
---
Several places I think.
---
Post with a map somewhere on this sub
---
must have just missed you. says you're not playing anymore oh well. i'll check out where you found it see if i can too.
---
&gt;And dont tell me I dont know anything blah blah blah because the same exact glitches that were happening in fallout 4 are identically happening in FO76...so if they can copy paste code and call it a whole new game
---
This has to be the single most stupid statement I've ever read about anything, ever.
---
There's a power armor station at forward station Delta, and a weapon and armor bench at the unmarked shed just west of drop site to (exit from glassed cavern). Both of them are generally inside (or like a 5 second jog from) the event area of scorched earth.
---
I hope they add some to Endurance. There's nothing I want in Endurance before level 30. I also hope there's not too many more in Strength because it's already heavily over-loaded.
---
Seeing as how Deathclaws are ambush predators, it probably makes more sense for them to fight the way they do in 4 and 76, as opposed to just charging at you. I think it makes them seem more intelligent and methodical, kind of like actual animals, instead of high level bullet sponges.
---
As a baseball bat lover, what could clubber be?
---
You still there?
---
Nothing I have posted was a shit on you. Yes, Im shitting on Bethesda, but in my defense, they are acting like something you should shit in.
---
If you want to dive in the way so you can claim some sort of personal victimhood, that's your call. But it's not for me to resolve for you.
---
Well I read that completely wrong. Good job on keeping your base!
---
Sorry that you are salty for some reason.
---
May I suggest you take deep breaths?
---
I have the pearly peepers
---
You have brains? Most people only have the 1. You must be lucky. Troll. Lol
---
Did...did I reply to the post? NO!!!!!
---
Have the same thing going on with my T-60. Have an option to apply the bone raider skin the the right arm only. Doing so made it look like bone raider excavator armor, albeit with the T-60 stats O_o
---
Not really, just looking for those ass/sent pieces I mentioned in my original post. Weapon wise I'm pretty strapped
---
Did....did I comment on the post? I was trying to comment on a comment...
---
Ive been trying for 2 days now. Always zero. Thats if the vendor even shows. Its fucked up.
---
Radiation overlapping health bar
---
They wanted it to be a hidden surprise, you know Beth 🙄
---
Go to the firebreather station and add the appropriate scorch killer mod to your weapon. Only don't, because it's crap.
---
I guess I'll just throw in one more voice saying I don't think repair kits should cost atoms.
---
It does in fact say 6 days on it. So limited to the week.
---
you just don't know how vendors and caps work, apparently
---
This is the first step on a really bad path. They screwed up here in my opinion.
---
I have a sentinel armor piece gimme yo gt
---
I never have purchased them, I never will. Anyone who does is actively encouraging Bethesda to screw them over.
---
I could be wrong but it’s not lazy. It’s intentional. Each horseman skin will use each PA of 45,51,60 and x01
---
Scarecrows KIND OF work but I don't want to build up too much hope in case you actually try using them.
---
These challenges are temporary and will change soon. Then you can delete the ones you don’t want to keep.
---
You can quick slot them.
---
Thanks brother, great picture aswell!
---
I want ALL the plushies!
---
Instead of signs for free water, etc. you could just use a wall as a message board and use lettering. I haven't looked into how much CAMP budget that would take up though.
---
Server hopping does not effect caps.
---
Each vendor shares a 1400 cap pool. 
---
If you buy out all caps, they are empty u til you sell them more items or wait 20 hours for the cap pool to refresh.
---
If it shows 0 but should be higher, either exit the vendor and reopen or sell a 1 cap item and the amount refreshes to what it should be.
---
Server hopping has no effect on available caps. Never has.
---
Are you still there??
---
Just added, I'm in the que to join server. Thank you!
---
I do. But the caps have been at zero for 2 days now. The vendor at Whitesprings doesnt even show half the time. Thats why im asking. I server hop and its the same thing.
---
I hope they wouldn't hide that behind a perk though!
---
I legitimately love this.
---
Yes for a minute
---
I need to get the plans for big letters one of these days. But I do love the idea of an actual sign lol.
---
Yeah, I agree about combat from a vehicle, but you can swing a bat or shoot a pistol easy enough, just not very likely to hit your target. Those were just quick brainstorm ideas.bimbglad you like most of it, hopefully Bethesda does too
---
Yeah its a but, any emote while handling the camera will do this
---
Tapping "Q" once zooms in for me... tapping "Q" a second time zooms in further... tapping "Q" a third time reverts back to normal zoom level.  
---
I believe the new lenses/etc. will be released gradually over time.
---
Def true, saving my stuff and just repairing my stuff the ole fashion way.
---
Hopefully, Clubber is aoe swings that melee is really missing.
---
So the ‘real’ Sheepsquatch is just a Mothman in a Sheepsquatch costume!
---
Ah man the world's full! D:
---
How is using a gauntlet in power armor different than duping items? At yo seriously asking how it’s different? Holy moly guy
---
That’s really interesting-  is that an open discord group?
---
I was just in a server not a week ago, and they nuked alpha prime, and it seemed like everyone on the server joined in! 
---
I hope they fix that if it was unintentional, no way I’ll ever have enough caps for all of the serum recipes I want.
---
I know that. Im only trying the server hop idea cause for the last 2 days now vendors arent there half the time and when they are they have zero caps. Thats why i resorted to this stupid post. Lol
---
Works for me....
---
Dang - world full. Need some peeps to drop after they got theirs
---
What's bannable is its against the terms of service which clearly prohibit taking part in an exploit AND the uploading of exploits. There's no grey area or little white exploits here, they're doing something they damn well known they shouldn't be able to do.
---
Equip the camera
---
Then Emote
---
Whoops
---
Just an update, I saw on what I believe was a Bethesda support page that they are aware of this issue, where the in-progress Wasted on Nukashine quest disappeared and could not be restarted. No fix in the patch today, but they at least know people are having this issue.
---
yeah that too xD
---
server hopping and vendor caps have zero to do with each other
---
until bethesda announced they were coming to the item shop people were asking for them like people do for fridges. so there is a demand for them.
---
a big enough demand that bethesda saw $$.
---
It is an item that gives a game play advantage.Iit is p2w, not simple convenience.
---
Bingo! After 400+ west tek runs, thats the first time that happened
---
It depends. You can freeze them almost solid in under 30 seconds if you get them close. Then thatll last like 30 seconds before they start to thaw and the thawing happens in stages. It's a really good debuff when you have tons of people pouring it on. Helps keeping the SBQ in melee.
---
its a universal 10mm scope :P
---
Agree with you but you could always skip on them you know
---
How in the hell are they doing version control?  There is no way old bugs should be coming back willy-nilly like this.  :(
---
I'm not saying you did. I'm just speaking in general. All of this shit's just frustrating simply due to the fanbase making mountains out of molehills, like this, or any of the other things i mentioned, instead of focusing on the actual problems, like how the game is still buggy as fuck or what have you.
---
Because unless you glitch it getting into power armor removes unarmed weapons and if you try to switch to one you can't equip it.
---
Prime or scorched receiver I believe.
---
Scorched
---
100% agreed. I submitted a ticket on Bethesda's site, but nothing came of it.
---
I agree. Besides any of the back and forth on the topic i think the ultimate reason they are bad is that they take away from the survival grind.
---
 Having to grind the materials to repair the various kinds of armor play a big factor in how you approach situations. If i can repair my armors without ultracite or ballistic fiber then whats the point of these resources being so uncommon.
---
Heh, I think the same regarding repair kits. Plus as far as breaking weapons mid fight, there's always a knife as a backup weapon. Sure it's not as devastating as a TSE gun, but as long as you're doing damage then it keeps you playing.
---
Could it be that you have the camera equiped?
---
:on my way to buy atoms:
---
It's certainly not the first, and with that attitude it will be just the start of what's to come. If no one protests broken promises, they will continue to be broken even more frequently and freely. When you look the other way, it encourages companies to make promises they have no intention of keeping just to get more business. That fact that many of them do it is a shame, not a justification. It's like saying many baseball players use steroids, so there shouldn't be a penalty for it. "It's just part of the game." "Everyone does it." If you're ok with companies going back on promises, or with baseball players using steroids, you don't need to protest personally. But you can't expect other people not to take exception with it when there are very good grounds for doing so in the name of honesty and accountability.
---
It's not pay to win if you redefine the term
---
There isn't a question about what is "more of an advantage than" something else...  it's that there was to be nothing sold in the atomic shop that gives anyone ANY advantage over someone else without that item.  I'm still baffled why this is even being debated.  A company sold a game to the public with a promise ... that promise is now being broken 5 months after game launch. What's next?
---
You might as well add West Tek to the legendary nerf as of this patch. I should have some data to back this up but I need to run it about 7 more times to get a full sampling. It doesn’t look good however.
---
Pre-orders will be on sale soon better get all the dlc on lock now ya know so i don't have to worry about the impending global monetary crash. Caused by a particularly vicious crowdfunding campaign for star citizen 2 in which they took over a banking institution outfitted it with rockets and grav sails and proceeded to attack the ftse 100 and nadsat via their "aggressive wealth redistribution r.e. we all want cooler space ships" plan
---
I'm almost wondering if the PS4 is glitched, lol. Only seen PC and Xbox posts about actually FINDING him, and I've spent the last... Six hours? slowly cycling through the spawn points. Rip
---
My Little Pony:  Wasteland edition.
---
"My cutie mark is a fucking mini gun!"
---
See, I thought the same thing and even though it states what it is, it was still poorly worded. I thought that you got two pieces. A casual under armor and an over armor outfit. Sadly I was wrong and blew 700 atoms on one of the worse under armor types.
---
Now it will all be fixed lol
---
Loving this new fast travel feature!
---
I mean, youre not entitled to every skin lol, its a cosmetic item used to hopefully fund the future of the game. Itll eventually go down in price as theyve done with most of the skins so far each week
---
Will be on about 20 more mins, then off until 10 pm est
---
Vertibots worked for me but I had to be just a few feet from it. It didn't count when I was not nearly touching it.
---
I glitched the camera on to making me unable to do anything other then reloading
---
Hey thanks that’s good to know. I’m currently lvl 49 so wasn’t aware.
---
Imo. 
---
The crossbow. (Even though I believe it to be good weapon overall it just needs more mods)
---
Single action revolver.
---
The Bowie knife. 
---
Black powder weapons
---
All have the same problem. Good on paper but lack when it’s time to perform.
---
Ah, ok. Breaks the game eh? Not anywhere near my system so I'm just a reddit watcher until I get home.
---
I found 5 of them, and the film is easy to craft as well
---
Don't know why people keep expecting the right thing. I would have wanted that and even believed for a while, but there is no reason to think they would course correct. The best thing to do is to cut our losses and detach emotionally  the whole thing. If this bothers that much, I already got my money's worth out of the game. There're other games out there.
---
Specifically I was referring to PC gaming, probably should have been more specific. While I grew up in the NES era, I spent more time on PC. Lots of Starcraft, Morrowind, SimCity, Dominion Storm over Gift 3, Populus, Neverwinter Nights, Warcraft 2-3. Maybe some of those cost up to $60, but I would bet the majority of them were under $50, and effectively had infinite replayability through new characters or multiplayer/ai games. More importantly, they didn't require 6 months of patches afterwards to make the game stable.
---
Feel free to add these nasty ones to your list:
---
* When vendoring items, sometimes the item sold is NOT the item that goes to the vendor.  ALWAYS ALWAYS check when you are done to make sure that they didn't get the wrong thing!  This seems to happen more often when you have some kind of sorting going on.
---
* Reading plans sometimes gives you something completely different.  For example, I bought the Whitesprings Signs plan today, read it, and it taught me how to make a Fixer.  :|
---
yes!
---
Making a second character does not work for me though. Bleh. I’m a one girl girl.
---
lawls of the year award goes to
---
The ammosmith perk and super duper didn't count for the challenge for me even tho I made 9 40mm grenades in one batch, it only counted the base 5. Super duper didn't count for the molotovs neither.
---
Agreed but I’m still going to play and I’m sure there are more like me and you and that will continue to play it as well regardless of what they bring to the store. 
---
Unpopular opinion I have but People complaining about pay to win for a repair kit seem to overlook buying TSE weapons or unyielding or sentinel armor they didn’t earn themselves is ok... sorry but they buy it to get an edge and that edge is evident to “win” or do better. 
---
They justify it since they bought it with caps. 
---
Maybe things in game you win or get dropped should be assigned to the character winning them? 
---
On top of that duped weapons and armor are all over the place and I’m 100% sure Bethesda can figure out the drop rate compared to how many have something.
---
Currently I am unable to make the new imposter assaultron head. Also in the news section it says its a skin for the salvaged assaultron head yet when I search for it to make it is popping up as its own weapon not a skin. So now weapons are in the atom store by this logic
---
still there?
---
Also, if you have the camera out and sit down somewhere, you can now do emotes while seated.
---
Maybe not lazy, but its done because its too much work making different looking paint sets for each PA. Its not a quirk thats for sure
---
Slightly cooler (around pie on windowsill temp)  take: Lets make this game that we couldn't shift as a full price item into a FtP monstrosity that also has an entry fee.
---
Ahh.
---
Ya that happens to me.
---
Just wait a few minutes for the server to finish loading assets. 
---
You're moving faster than Bethesda computers can manage.
---
I load in, have to wait about 2 mins for everything to load then the vendors show up.
---
Here I’ll give you one: You play a sniper and you snipe at a player with a melee build you shoot them and your gun breaks. He’s running towards you, but you’ve got enough time to pop a repair kit and kill him.
---
if you see 0 caps avail and you know it's been 20 hours, sell a bobby pin or something worth 1 cap and you'll see it update.
---
&gt;Good to know.  Thanks for the info .....   
---
&gt;I was so p.o'd at the nerf that I cast aside TS weapons ...  I had that ONE lv 20 TS from lv 18 to lv 50 (only gun that i had that had any worth).  Found it at a vendor originally.  Gave it to a lv 19 player when I bought lv40 AA and saw they were comparable.  Then the Nerf ... got a lv 40 TS on a legit drop the next day that wasn't near as good as the AA and ditched it in anger, and have been selling off any TS I get since.  
---
&gt;Made assumptions ... got caught, ass they say.
---
honestly, zones half loading like this happens to be a couple of times a week.
---
Not everyone wants to use the shitty selfie mode. I've lost track of all the awesome photo opportunities I've missed because it took too long to have to open the stupid thing and get everything positioned right. I'll take a simple point and click camera any day.
---
Pretty sure that is number of server hops you have to do to get it...lol
---
On a smaller note, the Challenge range for the camera is very short. taking photos of Vertibots for this weekly was a hassle. had to go to a power plant, repair a landing pad, and take a pic before it flew of for it to count
---
I think people expect the right thing here because there are a ton of things that we would accept as valid atomic store items and quite a few of us are waiting to give them money for things that are not this. It's just boggling
---
I heard you’re on PC
---
And it’s up to the developers and the execs to know what their customer base wants in a game.
---
It’s not the customers fault when the company fails to listen, and fails to live up to their promise. They promised cosmetic only, this is not that.
---
Path of Exile is the gold standard of how to sell microtransactions in a free to play game to survive. They exist and grow with no cash up front from the customers because they listen to their player base. 
---
Just recently a popular streamer was joking about an ability they just released and saying they should have cats used as the spell projectile animation on a cosmetic. Reddit jumped on board and wanted it, the community manager thought it was hilarious and awesome, several weeks later we got the ability to have a spell shoot out galactic cats.
---
My friends and i enjoy it. I ate a player lastnight and even the manwinch was laughing.
---
Thank you 😉
---
your food meter is dropping as fast as hell now, I've been playing for an hour or so and I've had to eat a ton of food
---
I tried twice after reading about it, and apparently it warps you through the world, making you reappear quite a distance away. Second time I tried, I actually fell into an endless loading screen ... but restarting fixed that
---
You know there is more to the game than survival mode right?
---
I mean, they put in the camera. (woo). It's now going to take up a random spawn spot chance (what the shit, spawn hopping is annoying enough as it is). We get some new quests as a result. That's nice.   
---
We have non-transferable loot from the SBQ/possibly other end game boss type events, in the form of the "improved" repair kits. I'm not psyched about that at all, not being able to transfer the atom shop kits (which shouldn't exist at all) is one thing. Not being able to trade \_in game loot\_ is not ok.   
---
They changed a few scrap items? Woo?  
---
They fixed a core gameplay mechanic that should have had a hotfix the next day. Good job, guys?  
---
Like, i've never been psyched for the camera. I'll do the questline, then I'll go back to using photomode, because using film to take in game pictures sounds like way to much of a pain in the ass for no good reason.   
---
The stability fixes will \_always\_ be appreciated, though, and there were some of those. So go core engine team!   
---
What are we supposed to be super psyched about, here?
---
Right! On a side note, the kits cost only 50 atoms which can be earned quite easily.
---
Not sure. At the Tyler County Fair he's sitting in stands in the middle of the area, at Wavy Willard's he's in the parking lot... I don't know if there's going to be too much of a pattern for where he appears besides it being at tourist areas.
---
I’ll use my camera to escape players in survival. Wonderful.
---
I would be more excited if they offered something like that for regular armor. I know there’s a lot of players that will disagree and everyone can have their opinions but in mine, power armor is complete junk. I used to love my x01 until a long time ago when I’d always blue screen when I’d move two feet in my power armor. So I adopted a power armorless build and trashed my power armor. I held onto it for a long time but the only perk that I liked was no fall damage.
---
Many other players tend to see the same. Especially when heavy hitters don’t go to a poorly placed queen run. I’m sure the ones who prefer regular armor vs. power armor would love new skins. Not just for combat armor. But Bethesda is selling the crap out of these power armor skins, so it’s not shocking that the rest of the skins are mediocre at most.
---
The problem is that they can just tweak some numbers and make repairing normally harder to do so it encourages people to pay more money.
---
A day, for me.
---
I mean it’s not a huge life decision laying before you.. if you feel the urge to play it just start up the game and take it for a spin..
---
In that case, the cosmetic outfits give an advantage. Because if I'm wearing an outfit no one can tell what kind of armor I have on and therefore gives me an advantage.
---
I'm sorry but we just seem to disagree on what pay to win means. I've never thought "aw man, I would have won if only I had been able to repair my items on the fly".
---
The people that will be using these kits are lazy. Everyone has access to perks( for free) that repair items better than the kits. The only thing the kits save you is time spent gathering materials...which, aside from power armor, I've never been wanting for mats to repair.
---
I'm not saying the introduction of convenience items to the shop is a good thing, I'm only saying it gives little to no advantage over anyone who doesn't use them besides saving a half hour tops worth of time.
---
Not at all, because they didn't come from disassociated store outside of the game
---
These items fund future development.
---
It isn't intended for every player to get every single item or there would be no variation in the world.
---
Plan, save, choose your favorite.
---
No sir
---
Can you imagine if going to the bathroom was a requirement like eating and drinking???? 
---
Wonder if you get a speed bonus running to toilet?? lol
---
In that I agree. It's what's next I don't like... refrigerators, bullet conversion, etc.....  When will it stop?  If it stops here, not a big impact. If it goes further (which BSG pretty much promised it will) then we will have dupers and BSG screwing things up.
---
If you already own it, you have nothing to lose by trying it again. I love the game and others hate it. You can only gauge for your own on if it’s worth it or not.
---
Definitely should have boldy stated that it was underarmor. I *almost* fucked up and bought it as well.
---
It would be one of the sweetest "outfits" in the game, but as it is, it doesn't even look as good as the other underarmors.
---
Oh 100% I wouldn't want to put in the time to get each one and would skip some but what I'm arguing is that it should be possible. Especially seeing as it is in most every other game with timed items.
---
too bad level basically has no advantage when it comes to pvp. they handicap your opponent to make the fight "fair". in this case, you "thought" you came out stronger. 16 vs 91 = 16 vs 16 basically. or 91 vs 91.
---
BPW are okay, but they have to be budfed to hell. Insta, explosive, crit damage the dragon would be other worldly.
---
This happened to me yesterday and I couldn't get out of it. I had to delete the saved data on my system. The settings and something else. And boom popped back into the world..
---
Good to know.
---
Survival mode is complete trash because this is even possible. You shouldn't be able to hop modes and avoid consequences.
---
invite me GT is RecklessDovah
---
They're not returning your items because you're bugging a fucking tech support rep on some God forsaken call center who doesn't know what you're talking about beyond the canned responses they have in their database let alone the power to actually affect anything in game.
---
No kidding!? Daaang. I was really feeling good about it. 😖
---
The madlad did it. I tried climbing it up yesterday without jetpack halfway through, wasn't successfully but knew it would be possible with a jetpack. Congrats!
---
I was able to keep my key
---
Yup they should be doable for a hardcore player if you ask me , incentivize other to use real money
---
Sell a burnt mag for 1 cap... cap amount will appear OR your too soon from day before selling...
---
Worked for me no issues. Did you try any troubleshooting like switching servers?
---
&gt;o follow Reddit and, based on the comment on the patch notes, know that this upset at least some of their fan base.
---
Yeah they made it pretty evident. Honestly I would have been less pissed if the community manager just flipped us off
---
I agree but at the same time look at the given examples, both Fortnite and Overwatch are rolling in cash from their microtransactions while being completely accessible to none paying players. Supporting the game with micro transactions is after all a choice as each player has already payed to support the game on launch.
---
xXxPussySlayer69xXx left the message "lol fukken noob"
---
Was the door already open??? I did it twice and it said in upper left key removed.
---
Battlecoat with swappable armor pieces (full Combat Armor/sturdy metal limbs &amp; heavy leather chest)
---
Legacy outfits - outfits from previous fallout games like the Merc, Wastelander and Raider Outfits From fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas
---
Legacy Weapon Skins - Model textures from previous games that change entire appearances to weapons New Vegas’s Carbine Skin for the Assault Rifle, Fallout 3’s Power Fist/Deathclaw skins
---
As far as I know, you don't fix a hole by drilling another one next to it.
---
Gamer tag?
---
That’s probably true. And it’s unfortunate they backed themselves into a corner on the cosmetic thing. I hope they can find other ways besides the single-use gameplay-avoiding style items.
---
I want the crossbow to viable *so badly*. I have a collection of 6 or 7 (I think?) max level 3* crossbows hoping they get some love someday.
---
3 minutes? I've seen people farm for hours to repair their armor.
---
FYI that he logged off that world
---
Exactly, I was very tempted to when they added in new better items but this has put me right off.
---
They are. I just wish they “could” have mods. Not just the bayonet. Better frames, quicker reloads at a cost of X. Something to make them a unique item for early game, mid game, and late game. As well for fun and whatnot. Not just a cheese weapon.
---
Everyone loves Far Harbor and it was a good DLC, but this one is my favorite.
---
same as my user name Badwolf336
---
Yea had a proc on a scaly skin serum before ...
---
You sure you have the right card equiped? I have SD 1 and 3, and you dont wanna know how often I put the 1\* in when I wanted the 3\* :)
---
Do the board for melee.
---
Anmosmith does NOT work. It only counts the base value.
---
Ok I'm joininh
---
I think it's stupid that some items can't be used by individuals in power armor.
---
Got it, you rock!
---
and...speed demon
---
well, I'll have to make sure I play that day, because I want one for my bar.
---
Oh, yeah my issue was different. Watch out for that chameleon fucker anyway. 
---
I have that bug most often with invisible ghouls. It never occurred to me they could be under the world so the next time I deal with it I’ll try jumping onto something high.
---
Pathetic , on the bright note , it does craft 3
---
What, you don't like reading "Thanks for all the feedback :D" while knowing that they don't really care about your feedback? lol
---
I already posted on crossbows. Hopefully someone Bethesda Austin is taking notes. My Huntress build is maining the crossbow and while it’s fun as can be. It leaves you wanting more.
---
Never going to happen because the mods are too clueless. People haven brought it up before, both the lack of organized links and the total waste of the stickied threads we do usually have, and the excuse was that reddit apparantly doesn't have those kinds of functions every other sub has.
---
Interesting. I just got into the last dome for the X-01 paint but I'll try that on my alt when I want the things from inside
---
Personally, I don’t like it cause it’s casual lining, which I don’t have a use for on any character.
---
Unfortunately, I play on XB1.
---
Did you get it done all at once, all ten on one server?
---
a win is a win in the end, so you still deserve to feel good about it. but you should also know the truth lol
---
Nope it's nop open prior to me. Only way I get ammo for the alien blaster (for my friend) since the ammo plan don't work for me. Everytime I log in I hit up all 3 domes I have open and grab the quantum &amp; nuka paints and the alien ammo since I'm close.
---
I've been hopping servers for over three hours at three different locations on PS4 and haven't seen him yet. This has got to be the dumbest way to add new content to a game that I've ever seen.
---
Happen to me inside valley galleria thumbs up would put me on the other side of hall instantly
---
Thank you. It is possible without a jet pack. Just needs a lot of time and patience. I would estimate I tried it at least 20 or so times until I finally managed it but yes a jet pack would make it easier.
---
Ive only been playing for 3 weeks now. New to this so stupid questions are gunna happen.
---
Used to run a dragon before I got speed demon. Its something i never want to have to go back to.
---
Also, just figured out you can now do emotes while sitting in chairs and on couches if you get the camera out first. Never used to be able to do that but now you can tell people to come over to you while sitting down.
---
Click bait title
---
It’s what Fallout was meant for. A zany wild and crazy time.
---
It's just a visual glitch, it happened to me and my damage output was the same as punching without a weapon. Seems pointless to me...
---
More mods would be cool.
---
The lag aka frame drops everyone is experiancing is from all the texture maps trying to load and ends up fucking up .. they really need to go back to the drawing board or allow a diffrent dev team in
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm like lvl 96 and haven't done one yet. I got all the way up to the control room and defending the silo dudes and decided to wait until I could do it with someone.
---
If you think anyone is going to spend money or all of their daily atoms for a single fucking 100% repair then you may as well shut yourself down.
---
Yea, but the server had like 5 people total
---
I can get on at 9:30, can u?
---
Not until 10
---
I photographed the Flatwoods monster earlier and it didn’t count toward alien.
---
Would buy skins weekly if they were .99c to $5 max. Costs just way to much for what it is.
---
wasnt on today how do I get the cam do I just grab one of those or is there a related quest I need to start first?
---
They don't, though. They sell a very limited stock of items, and what few items that are _really_ nice come and go in very short windows. 
---
They could pump out simple paint swaps for all armor and gear in _very_ little time, and toss those up on the shop for atoms and people would buy them like hotcakes. 
---
Not re-textures, not complicated paintings, simple manipulation of color pallets. 
---
They've CHOSEN not to do so.
---
Whether technology they want except for a wireless charging pad
---
I did downvote you. Not because of what you said, but the way you phrased it. Tone. I didn't like it, and I don't feel it helps fuel a constructive conversation.
---
I mean, there is a few Vertibots that are stuck on the ground.
---
The two weekly i've been tracking say 30700 days aha.
---
Only, that's not the official party line. The official line from the company heads is this game is doing _very well_. Not that it flopped.
---
Ignorance is a sin on reddit. I forgot, whoops.
---
"Now, the same community that hates the idea of purchasing Repair Kits with real money is the same community that dislikes Survival mode and its focus on PVP. "
---
You're supposing there.  Some of us are just familiar with F2P games, and QOL paywalls like this are the backbone of that model.
---
I don't expect to be super excited over a patch, or minor adjustments for gameplay mechanics. The point I was going for was normally there's a huge number of posts about the same issues and the outrageous mindset of Big Beth in allowing this to happen. It's just nice to see next to nothing after this patch, it makes a nice change.
---
What  the hell is "Briefcase Bloodhound" why do we need a perk card to find  Briefcases with a nuke symbol on them 
---
it looks like the nuclear "football" (the command console that goes everywhere with the US president in case of the need to authorize a launch) trump uses it to prop up a wonky table when not using it as a masturbatory aid
---
Yet here you are commenting on something that doesn’t affect you anymore, stop being a jerk dude let people enjoy things none of this affects you if you’re not playing anymore

didn't they? :o
---
We should be able to lift some fuckin weights and get ripped like in GTA SA
---
Do you seriously expect a business to outright admit a flop? C'mon.
---
I haven’t done it in a while, I guess they fixed it then...
---
You shld really clarify that next time when someone replies to your post or comment. I see you not responding when doubters comment. You shld aggresively shoot down misconceptions they have if you really want to show you didn't carry out cheats. Not responding to doubters and reading as a third party makes it such that you seem more likely to be a cheater than you might be. It's gonna be annoying to do it but you maybe make a tldr response version and copy paste and counter misconceptions towards your ban. 
---
Not saying you are a cheater or not though. Just putting what i've observed so far.
---
I completely disagree. They've put actuall effort into Atomic Shop items thus far. Simply "shades" of colors likely wouldn't make a splash.
---
I feel like usually if I spit my strategy out people get defensive of their own strategies.
---
Not just in video games either...
---
￼
---
I agree the limited time should be much longer. I missed out on the bone excavator armor. I do however like the rareness once its not in the shop anymore so I do like things being limited.
---
It's an issue caused by Buffout or other max health increasing aid items.
---
And maybe they will. Time will tell.
---
I try all day every day! Hell even after 1000 hours I learn new stuff I didn't know!
---
They still on?
---
They reintroduced repairing, it was in NV and 3 and then gone in 4
---
I'm just waiting for the list of shadow-nerfs to come out, because that will, inevitably be far longer than the official patch list. It seems like it always is.
---
trying to claim cosmetic items are p2w is a pointless stretch for a distraction.
---
as far as I have ever seen "pay to win" has always ment "pay to gain an advantage" be that over other players or the game itself. it have never applied solely to pvp or battles. There are plenty of city builder games and such where you can "p2w" ie pay to clear that build timer.
---
sure people that use them might be lazy, that is kinda the point of them. trek all the way back to your camp (or some other workbench, and ignoring any mats you might or might not have) and back or have a for purchase repair here and now and keep on trucking. They are not going to make the game easier so you won't see the need of them. They didn't put them in the game not to be bought.
---
" it gives little to no advantage over anyone " doesn't have to give an advantage over other players to be p2w. as I have said before p2w is not a pvp term.
---
Well with those you basically have to spend your entire life on there to earn it for free.
---
Most players pay for their skins.
---
So we are just missing the option to give away every waking second to earn a skin for free by playing 23.5 hours a day.
---
I'll take the pay skins over that.
---
If they want better financial support from their audience? Yes.
---
Enjoy, while it last... 😁
---
Did you even read my post ? I was mainly asking about what's new? Like I said I quit because of the updates.
---
I have limited space, Apex Legends and other games came out so I had to make choices.
---
wth? /Confused.
---
I love you. Got it first try at Watoga
---
3\* weapons are a real thing. All the weapons I use and armor I wear are 3\*  I think you were trying to hit "4\*" in your post. Completing the Firebreathers Quest will give you the ability to put a "Scorched" mod on most weapons.  It will add a a \* to any weapon that will receive it.  I usually add it to 3\* weapons I don't want that will accept the mod to actually give it the 4th\* for salability.  Sacrificial blade is also a "Legendary mod" for some bladed weapons and will add a \*.
---
No, only the guerilla skill will apply to the gun as it has a automatic receiver.
---
Yeah try it out, see if it's all fixed for you now. I have the keys on 2 of 5 toons and still have them all. Even started getting nuka grape and dark from one of the nuka domes. I think the middle one was it, the T51b nuka paint dome. It was in a nuka machine in back.
---
// Just another perspective from a comment on this thread.
---
That was your point, yes.  I have explored that point and found it lacking, for reasons already expressed.
---
Really? You don't think people would pay for, say, a 50% grayscale wash over the combat armor texture? 
---
that people wouldn't pay for a darker/lighter/rainbow of colors for power armor skins? 
---
Because I'd buy the shit out of a basic, non badged, black power armor skin.
---
This man gave up Chicken and Stove top for Fallout out!  I mean damn!!
---
I’ve i were them I would use and alt and reply like this.
---
Sad but true , I did had a conversation with a buddy of mines and I told him I would be willing to toss 40 dollars to them and get the 5000 atom bundle just for the single fact of me those 4 cool skins and as a “thank you” to them but I did say after never since I did pay the same amount of money for dlc for fo4 and a this point me , being a hardcore user and fan think I have been more then happy to say I feel I got my pennies worth but some practices such as these are to sell to what the gaming industry calls whales
---
I found the tourist Ansel at The Giant Teapot slumped on a picnic table by the car park (parking lot)
---
I have been looking for hours now and cannot find it. Does anyone know the exact spot at the whitespring of the tourist? because frankly at this point I just server hop then.
---
People sell/buy items, and caps on ebay, and other sites for real life money. People on Reddit sell them for caps. Hmmm, kind of exactly like how atomic shop works. You can either earn currency in game playing the game, or spend real life money. Essentially they are the same thing, except you are getting best in slot armor, and weapons, which have a direct effect on the game. Which is far more dangerous to PvP. So if we are going to argue convenience items are P2W, then we have to admit trading is very much the same. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't want trading to go anywhere. I can't wait for the vending machine update, and the put things on shelves, but I am not going to feign ignorance like it isn't worse. Even if selling items for real life money is frowned upon, it still happens. It is also hard to stop completely there will always be a place for it, its just the nature of these types of games. It has always been an issue. 
---
I also don't mind pay for convenience, which is what the atom shop is adding. Most free to play games, or b2p with no subscription use. Since 76 is online, doesn't have a subscription, and are not charging for DLC they need to make money to host the servers, and continue development somehow. Those things are expensive, especially being their first real multiplayer. Which is going to set the ground work to have optional coop in future games.
---
Maybe what irritates me so much about this constant barrage of messages about repair kits is that I've never bought any atoms in the first place and never intend to.
---
Like royal taffy

Norwegian here play with a bunch of Italians that i met randomly.

Not on ps4, but [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgln59/tourist_and_camera_all_possible_spawn_locations/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is a list of locations
---
I’m on PS4 like to OP so I think my load times might improve a little. If it doesn’t I can always sent it back for free.
---
Finally dropped some Atoms on the Plague skin to help with my 40K playstyle.
---
Nothing will stop BSG from going pay to win.  It already started with the Unstoppables costumes this is phase II. The top brass already commited to it.  It's more how much can they get away with before people stop playing or the press gets bad enough (like Battlefront 2) then will they back off.  This is all just starting - the apathy I'm seeing here about repair kits guarantees phase III - probably refrigerators or bullet machines.  Then when that's exhausted they'll really get down to true pay-to-win armor sets, mods, charms to increase luck (legendary drops), etc... It's all coming if we simply ignore this and can only blame ourselves when it hits the fan.  Hopefully it will stay with repair kits and that's it. But a popsicle in hell has a better chance than that being the case.

You could make a decent shotgunner using those special points:

You could move the 3 points for chem fiend from endurance to luck and take rank 3 class freak.  Replace Lone Wanderer with Supressor 3 and Strange in Numbers if you play on a team. 
---
Weapon:  AAE Combat Shotgun (Vampire explosive shotgun would work too).  Carry a rifle for range and an auto Tesla for stealth boy users. 
---
Armor: 4 pieces of Assassins Sentinel and 1 piece of Chameleon Sentinel.  Dense mod on torso.  Ultralight on limbs.  
---
Mutations:  Marsupial, speed demon, bird bones, scaly skin, herd mentality (only if always on a team), eagle eyes, grounded (maybe).
---
This came up after last patch too, but turned up negative as a bug.  Keep trying.
---
But-but.... mixed matched armor is the [best kind](https://imgur.com/a/cST6yaz)! (:
---
Yes. Psn sbax77 tourist is next to the mothman museum by the statue.
---
Seriously?!  Because duping, making hundreds/thousands of items and introducing them into the game causing server instability and crashes, literally affecting everyones gameplay is really the same as someone being able to use a weapon in your PA.  How is that even comparable?  And how do you know this person hasn’t reached out to Bethesda to report it, or thinks that they made a change to the weapon/PA.  This is hardly a bannable offense 🙄
---
or that you can shoot the fans in watoga station and they break?
---
Energy weapons in general suck ass. Break fast, do little damage and have expensive ammo.
---
wasnt their a dead alien in a dumpster somewhere? you could try that one.
---
Was it a good concert?
---
Sounds more like each skin is only supposed to work on one type of armor, but this one is glitched so you can put it on any armor and it displays the X-01
---
TSE camera: takes two pictures at a time, both are blurry and over-exposed.
---
The best bug yet 😝
---
So far I think Bethesda is really missing an opportunity in diversity for weapons. It seems like the same old weapons since the game was released.
---
