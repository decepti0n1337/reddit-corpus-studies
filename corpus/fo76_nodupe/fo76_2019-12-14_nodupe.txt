Why would you craft them??? It‚Äôs definitely not worth about 750 caps a piece when you can go farming scorched and get at least 1 large one and a few other ones in less than 10 minutes
---
---
---
I am having a nagging issue where no matter what mode I use, team only or friends, no one can stay in the private world.
---

---
After a minute or so everyone but me is unceremoniously kicked out to the main menu because apparently they are not friends with me.
---
I have removed and re-added them to my friends list but no dice.
---
I guess these online 'friendships' do not meet Beth's standards?
---
What exactly is the event, killing Santa scorched and getting free stuff? I like getting free stuff, but what else is there to do?
---
So heartwarming of you üòÇ
---
Yeah at this point, i dont even think foul play unless they are over 4 or 500. Which i have seen. Like twice.
---
I love hunting these Santa scorched too. It‚Äôs awesome
---
As a new player I have not experienced any of that yet, but I try to help even lower than me. I‚Äôm level 30, just got the game after Black Friday.
---
- I use Power Patcher bc I always use Excavator PA (I should have mentioned that) and it's been a while since since I've used other armor, but I remember Excavator PA seemed to take a lot more resources to repair than regular PA. I use Excavator PA for the carry bonus.
---
- I really wasn't sure about Chem Fiend. I don't take chems unless I decide to help out with a SBQ or I'm struggling. I play mostly solo. I probably only pop a chem maybe 10% of the time I play.
---
- I've never used a mutation (other than taking too much rad damage) and I don't know anything about them. I need to look into them though.
---
- As for the perception tree, I really just wanted 3 perception so that I can equip 3 lockpick cards to pick locks when needed. If it wasn't for that, I'd probably just run 1 perception and go with green thumb (I make a lot of healing salve).
---
Thanks for the help. I'll look into mutations.
---
A craftable loot table!  thats actually pretty cool!!!
---
I dont know why but i got the impression you were just putting your items in there.   This seems like a nice system.
---
You use them to craft gifts - similar to those that the Christmas scorched drop - at the Tinker's workbench.
---
I am a little lost I‚Äôve found 4-5 Santa‚Äôs and killed them I‚Äôve not opened the gifts yet. Should I run chemist equipped now before messing with the gifts ?
---
Some very good advice here.  I would also concur on the glow sight instead of food perks in perception.
---
Thanks for the info...  to both of you
---
You craft a present at a tinker bench (hint: use chemist card) and it makes a present with a random reward like those dropped from scorched.
---
They are crafted gifts that give random stuff from the scorched present loot pool. Equip chemist to craft X2 the gifts.
---
I saw the bundle advertised on bethesda.net to li k twitch prime. I did that, but i havent logged onto 76 to see if i got it yet. Ive seen people here saying they havent recieved it two or three hours after doing it, ive seen some people say they recieved portions of it, but not all of it and ive seen people that have gotten everything after like a 10 minute wait. 
---
Ive seen too that people are saying you have to tinkers bench something. That it doesnt just show up. If nobody has a better answer, ill edit this post with my personal update next time i log in.
---
I just hide in a bush and do nothing with the exception of moving if the circle gets smaller. I don't like NW but I want to get the rewards.
---
From what ive heard, its a 1% drop
---
As a new player ( i got the game Black Friday ) I can heavily vouch for it. Most players in game are super friendly and more than happy to help( I‚Äôve had a few poor encounters, but I try to forget them). This Reddit is also very helpful with answering questions and the such. Pick it up! It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but overall if you enjoy fallout, this is one to pick up.
---
That is not a given. I got 22 small ones and a 'regular' one this playing session, no large ones at all.
---
On the other hand I have hoarded in excess of 500k caps - across multiple accounts - that I have no use for. Well, had no use for, now I do.
---
mutations are game changing and insanely powerful. 
---
At a minimum try marsupial, speed demon, and carnivore.  
---
Carnivore = never carry food ever again or just a bit for emergency as you can just eat what you kill.  marsupial + speed demon change the game in a very fundamental way and once you have them it's hard to go back.
---
Other mutations are more build specific but those 3 are the foundation every one of my characters is built upon.
---
I kept finding these at my camp on the side of seneca.
---
All Santatron brought me was coal.... I tried to tell him I've been good this year. He just won't listen  üò¢
---
Six accounts, about 12 hours playtime on each, no gift here either.
---
Fertilizer however, enough to make Unabomber a very happy man :P
---
As a solo player, I would also recommend dropping to Lone Wanderer 4 and Tenderizer as your Cha perks. 
---
They will give you so much more value than the ones you currently have up.   At least for basic adventuring anyway.
---
Well if it means anything I get what your saying and I know OP wants something different then the raids. Just by his description it sounds pretty close to the same. 
---
Hoard dungeon with 25 waves progressing to a legendary behemoth would be sweet though.
---
Maybe it doesn't need to maintain urgency.   We've lacked a reliable cap sink for quite some time and paying caps for a random shot at a rare plan is a pretty reasonable idea.
---
I live when people make statements like "BR is not fallout"....
---
Because everything about BGS Fallout universe is technically not Fallout. 
---
Games change. Off shoots happen. Series change as a whole. Get over it. 
---
And the major issue you're having here is that you talk about Fallout feel and then reference game mechanics and systems.... That's not what gives things the Fallout feel.  Not even close. It contributes, but it's not the primary impact on feel. 
---
It's the aesthetic. The humour. The soundtrack. The themes, tones, and setting. There's a plethora of little unmarked environmental stories that are told and they scream Fallout.
---
I presume so as it only has a capacity of 10?
---
I was wondering this as well
---
Source?
---
Because you will click on the wrong item and accidentally craft 5K cannonballs.
---
To argue with me.
---
Haven't been on Twitch in for ever, So thanks for the heads up for some free loot. That suit looks pretty sweet. 
---
Glad you got your issue sorted out as well. Happy Holidays!
---
Mine gets torn to pieces, even with the turrets.
---
I believe chemist only helps when you craft gifts.
---
How is it in terms of difficulty? It seems when I join the nuke event I can‚Äôt even survive the rads, let alone the creatures
---
No. Bethesda era Fallout games are known for their aesthetic, themes, humour, and setting. The wasteland. That's what their known for. A place you want to explore. The stories. The weird little places 
---
76 is rife with that. It's environmental and passive story telling is excellent.
---
PSA EQUIP PERK CHEMIST. crafts 2 !!! for some odd reason. 
---
Never but wrapping paper if the robot vender is at max cap. Get those 1400 caps off them and then get the paper. Maximize your efforts !!
---
Yeaah I managed to do it finally
---
Mines popped 2 gifts.
---
Nuke zones
---
I saw one user say it was a 1% drop rate. Ive looked for verification on that, but i cant find any. Asked for a source, havent gotten one yet. 
---
Not sure if thats true at all. Dont wanna get flak for passing it around like im assuming it is. Will continue looking for verification.
---
Yes
---
To get Stable Flux to use in crafting you have to make it at a chem bench. 
---
You will need the following for every 1 stable flux you make.
---
10 Raw flux of the type you want to stabilize.
---
1 High Radiation Fluid
---
1 Hardened Mass
---
1 Glowing Mass.
---
You can find all 4 of the ingredients you need in Blast Zones.   The Flux comes from plants that have mutated and the fluids and masses come from glowing enemies you kill inside the blast zone.
---
Go to tinker workbench and craft a gift.
---
They're rolling out new content for their player base. Why should they pander to those of you who have a negative opinion of the game instead of giving the people actually playing the game things they want?
---
Using chemist perk crafts 2. If  you are high level and floating at 30k when thee event began and usually just stuck buying and reselling serum plans for 18k.. then this rocks. 
---
I can make all my money BACK in an house selling the extras .. everyone gets to grab all the rewards and them doing so helps me get more. This is a win win shopping event for me.
---
Nuked Flora at a chem bench.  Tinker bench doesnt allow you to stabilize flux, only use it for crafting after its been made.
---
Thank god my turrets aren‚Äôt the only ones who see shitüòÖ
---
Ugh another gamebreaking bug. No wonder people say this game is literally unplayable.
---
Nope! You just buy the paper from any robot vendor under the misc tab. Then you craft it in the tinkers bench. If you put chemist on you should get double presents when crafting :)
---
Thanx u üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ
---
Yes, I had a three star spawn in the NW corner of Morgantown airport just across the street from the train station.
---
It says occasionally...
---
Ik most of that you need any level requirements
---
Datamining
---
I took a stroll from Charleston all the way to flat woods and got hella gifts
---
Why obviously? Double the effect for over double the price. Even weight wise diluted break even. 
---
People just don‚Äôt want diluted. They haven‚Äôt engaged the brain.
---
It‚Äôs free, and collects things for you.  I‚Äôd imagine the chance is pretty low, considering it requires nothing.
---
I have met 2 trolls and both ended up getting their butts handed to them. They were griefing a low lvl and everyone on that server kept killing them once it was discovered. I love the community here. One of the best around.
---
Because people don't usually compliment good services openly but complain about bad ones.
---
Thanks, edited
---
Pure flux requires 3 ingredients on top of the raw flux. High radiation fluid, glowing mass and hardened mass.  All 3 have a chance to drop from any enemy inside a nuke zone.  Most of the time you will end up with a bunch of one or two and not get the other.
---
Best bet if you are starting to need flux is to start looking for nuke zones.  When you see one head there and focus on farming the enemies, not picking flux.  All three parts do not spoil and can be kept in your stash.  Once you have a decent stockpile, then pick flux and craft it.  They all have weight though, especially the glowing mass and can eat your space up quickly.
---
When you do craft make sure to use the luck perk super duper. Gives a chance at getting two for the price of one
---
nope, you just have to be able to survive in the blast zone.   The enemies will be lvl 68s most likely, if you cant handle mobs of them on your own I would recommend taking a few friends in with you.
---
Sometimes you can get really lucky and find the mats for sale at player vendors. 
---
The Hardened mass show up in junk, and the fluids and glowing mass show up under aid.
---
yeah.  you don't read.
---
I do with ONE of my characters.  Not the present one.  Almost 3000 scrip used already .... ONE rifle in total of ALL the drops.
---
The only thing this game has out of what you listed that its the feel of fallout its the soundtrack. Whats the theme of this game? Loot kill declutter? If you think mechanics and systems arent what give it a fallout feel then you must not realize Bioshock isnt a fallout game. It has a insanely similar soundtrack, tone, and theme of the fallouts. Same with outer worlds. But theyre not fallout. Because the mechanics of the game are different.
---
Boosh, thats what I'm talking about. You make sure you get all the money from the venders 1400 cap before you buy that paper. Then you sell back whatever you can to get the 1400 back before the next purchase. This is a BLAST .. Did they realize this could work like this? Surely they couldn't have meant to let chemist work on the tinker bench. 
---
Yeah, I'm hunting the scoarched like MAD but I'm also nearly broke and my vender is FULL of THEE best stuff Ive sat on. Fixer plans, claw gaunt plans, all the rare extras from the gifts. Very fun.
---
Its not Christmas yet!!
---
Ban???
---
As a plan junkie I'm having a great time. Can't wait to have more play time.
---
Is it looking for naughty/nice gifts? Do you have a screenshot at least?
---
I'm sorry for the questions, but you're the first person to say yes.
---
I was asking because i was looking to verify your information and couldnt. I was hoping on a specific source. Sorry should have been more clear.
---
not if they're over encumbered
---
Lmao i ran into about 4 level 10-15 last night all doing collision course. I dropped 150 diluted stims and they went nuts
---
What fucking humor are you talking about? 76 isnt funny. There is no humor. Did you play 3 or nv? The whole damn game leads up to a choice. If what you are saying is true how is Fallout differ from Rage? Oh yeah fucking mechanics and system
---
That‚Äôs amazing haha. I‚Äôve only seen a few so far- no clusters yet! Everytime I see one I get excited like ahhh time for gifts!!
---
That is bizarre
---
Need Power Armor, radaway, and decent damage builds. By level 40/45 you should be able to contribute somewhat towards nuke zones. Enclave storylien will get you suited for launching nukes.
---
If they could figure out new and interesting stuff to put in the packages on a regular basis it would definitely work. The problem like someone else said is that the value falls off a cliff once most of the players learn the plans.
---
They should add some of the atomic shop stuff that bombed or didn't sell very well into the presents.  Or throw some of the ultra rare cosmetics into the loot pool once in awhile.  I would think it should be easy to add hundreds of simple weapon skin plans into the loot pool as well.
---
I would really enjoy this
---
Wander.  Then wander some more.
---
Do events when you come across them.  
---
Then wander some more. 
---
I have over 1000 hours in game, and I still find new things at least once a week.
---
Game starts at lvl50, don't worry.
---
Tbh the main quests are there to help you get to lvl50, then you can start farming gear, do fast level ups and get better.
---
I mean that sounds like a personal problem
---
Not funny didn‚Äôt laugh
---
Way ahead of you. 
---
I made 60 of them last weekend just to be ready.
---
I had to refill it last night because in the 3 hours I was on, my punch bowl got emptied.
---
I like the one that says something about scrapping stuff returning the "materials used took to build".  Great proofreading, and it has been there forever.
---
This game is super hard for me honestly, being forced to use melee because I never have ammo, dying quickly ect
---
Good game but I can't get freaking anywhere
---
Ps4 btw
---
I just don't see it as aggressive vs. "camping." To me it's about strategic positioning.   My play style is not simply to avoid fighting.  My plays style is focused on the end game.  To win the match, you only need to win one fight (the last one).
---
It's true... I've seen him find new things then squeal like a little girl
---
The rads are what really kill people PVP. It‚Äôs my secondary PVP weapon of choice, behind my Junkies exploding LMG.
---
Yeah but for some people they enjoy fighting more than just winning :) it‚Äôs not just xp for everyone.
---
Sorry man, I was drunk and I took it the wrong way. Sorry genuinely.
---
Literally unplayable /s
---
LOL! I I know right?
---
Someone datamined mail boxes maybe we will get those next tuesday?
---
I have never ever in over a year ever seen any legendary at that event.
---
Always get the medium if you are going for weapon plans large for if you are going for the mounted heads.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox as well and we had to join a team from the home screen and I had to switch the toggle to team only I think and then I joined us to my private world
---
Shark, your giving away my secrets!!!!
---
Thanks for that. I had no idea it came with Amazon Prime.
---
Thanks for the heads up, my lvl 5 ass won‚Äôt accept lol.
---
When we can‚Äôt use it as an exploit to get unlimited experience immediately
---
Any idea how switch to team only
---
Go to the main menu. Invite to team from there. Then join private server.
---
Literally just went through it with a buddy
---
Yeah once you‚Äôre on a team and you click like play with team and you have the option for private world you click X to toggle it
---
Who cares if people talk crap if you bought it tell em to f off your money your choice!
---
Curious are new people still joining the game these days ? I haven't played in a few months been waiting for wastelanders, curious how the game is doing pop wise. Thanks

I did a lot of that chanting.... as the horde of monsters chased me through the wasteland. Good times, good times.
---
I did that it joined us like nuclear winter we got in world and a min later it popped up on my buddy we weren‚Äôt friends and he couldn‚Äôt play on private server
---
Dont understand your question. You mean you turned in the daily limit and now have 150 scrip?
---
I always thought it was funny that some companies will put out a myriad of updates and hotfixes, sometimes for seemingly trivial shit, but rarely seem to have a punch list of simple "oops, that was stupid" fixes. I know there are priorities and all, but I would be damned if I was going to create something with such exposure and leave a "we might be idiots" sticker pasted in even the most shaded corner. It displays either an absence of shame or an abundance of apathy.
---
Negative. The machine capped out early it seems, I was an adventure and there were already items in the machine when I exchanged after two hours.
---
I hit the max of turning in items?
---
And then they start running for their lives.
---
Chemist and super duper cards ftw
---
mob is a term that gets its roots at the very beginning of online RPG gaming. 
---
Its a short form of the term "Mobile Object"
---
I haven't seen this in a while but it used to sometimes save items others have turned in and they were viewable (and buyable for scrip) in the scrip machine. There is a 20 hour cool down for scrip to reset. So if you started turning scrip in at 10pm one night then tried at 4pm the next day it will now have scrip yet and you will still be maxed. 
---
Sorry if this doesnt help, I am still not fully understanding what is going on because I have not seen it but I am on PS4. Maybe somebody else on Xbox knows.
---
You can advance in the opposite direction first. And then open fire
---
At 2200, 10pm PST I will be offering nukashine in the ole swamp near white springs. I call my camp the swamp in honor of mash. I love nukashina
---
EQ adopted it from UO which got it from Text MUDs.
---
Think I had too much while typing...
---
PS4 as well, happened earlier.
---
Decided to let it cool down, maybe I turned in too much and god greedy.
---
I think initially I hit the max then bought, then got gifts and wanted to trade em.
---
late 70s text based MUD (Multi User Domain) games. 
---
Its origin is meant as an abbreviation for Mobile Object.  A non PC element in a game that is mobile.
---
I‚Äôll try it thanks for reply
---
You missed out,  Everquest was life.
---
The first day it's all buggy and someone uses all of their saved scrap and it only gets fixed like the third day and they get pissed.
---
Make sure to put up a big sign no one drinks from the punch bowls.
---
Venting is a healthy thing that is the reason I play is the let it out and let it go
---
When in the scrip machine what does the number say in the bottom right corner of the right inventory box?
---
IGN: xXDemolisher
---
Typically it‚Äôs full amount (can‚Äôt recall off top of head, like 150??)  I turned in some valuable scrip but terrible builds for my character.
---
Oh look another toll account
---
Drops good stuff too. Rare explosives plans, PA plans (parts not just mods), random junk, caps, scrip, and the mounted head plans (all the other ones never released into the game)
---
I'm building a Heavy/PA during the XP event as well, but took a slightly different route: [Junkies Heavy / PA build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f234d5e&amp;d=sr2s32sq2s22ip2ic4lu2lt2ls2l71a04ib4pq1sg2c72eh2l22&amp;w=p01i12i91&amp;m=cf932e&amp;nw=&amp;n=Heavy%20Gunner%20%2F%20PA)
---
I'll preface with the following:
---
- Started out with a JE Minigun and JE Gatling gun, so Fireproof is key for me not blowing myself up while killing things at close range
---
- Luck of the Draw procs enough for me to not break my guns every 20 minutes as the big guns can be brittle
---
- Conc Fire and First Aid are my swap outs for Grenadier and Stabilized when I'm not in PA. The Gatling gun is a fairly efficient and effective sniping tool and I'll run without PA a lot of the time to conserve Fusion cores. So PA during big scuffles and 5 pcs UL Vanguard armor when outside of it
---
- Pharmacist is to fill perk card gaps when leveling up, no other reason
---
I'm currently at level 54 and loving the build. Junkies has been a game changer for me in that I can still do good damage but run around at full health. Have already done a Bloodied Commando, Bloodied Melee and Junkies Commando, so this is my first foray into the Heavies.
---
Eventually I'd like to add a JE .50 cal or JE LMG to the mix for queen fights, but one step at a time...
---
Nobody can fix one bug introduced in an update in 20 minutes.  Except by reverting the update.  I'm prepared to bet that was what GW1 did.  In the case of the last FO76 update I, and I'm prepared to bet almost everyone else, did't want them to back out all the things in the update.  Taking a couple of days to just back out the bad part was the right thing to do.
---
Lol they still drop a lot of weapon mods
---
I already use mic, why should we not have a text based communication using terminal? Not only it would be really cool and also make sense, but it would be really helpful for deaf players.
---
Pretty sure juice head mentioned it in one of his vids on youtube.
---
Sorry to piggyback but how do I build it? I redeemed it but can't find it in the building menu.
---
Alright well that 150 goes down. If you turned in a 3* weapon it drops by 40, 3* armor is 24, etc. If you are trying to turn in a piece that is worth more than the machine has for the day it wont let you. Sounds like you already hit the limit for the day or what you are trying to turn in is worth more than what you have left for the day. This is normal, the number will go back to 150 20 hours after your first exchange.
---
Thank you. Ill check there.
---
Free loot is never useless
---
If you can find the Marine Armor Helmet plans that‚Äôs a cheap helmet to craft (materials-wise). Make sure you have super duper equipped while crafting. With high CHR and hard bargain it‚Äôs 31c per. Union Uniform is also cheap with just gold and cloth, though that‚Äôs only 16c.
---
That's the easiest way to get someone to drink from the bowl. "Do Not Drink" :)
---
Only if you dont like junk, plans and chems.
---
Yeah, but "I couldn't take a picture cause I was more focused on not dying and running," is totally unbelievable.  Nobody is going to miss a good video on the tubes just to save their lives.  Be serious.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Weird, if it worked for you it should work for everyone
---
Best Beth can do is 100 atoms
---
New update made it do that more bugs theres like 500 posts of each subject on here lol everyones blowing up about it
---
Which caused several unintended consequences with weapons and armour. What I reported was presumably a result of that
---
Yeah I definitely need to look into that. I carry way too much food and drink. Thanks!
---
I haven't had any gifts from the santatron yet
---
What you‚Äôre most likely referring to is the new changes involving private servers actually being private now. 
---
Not sure if you already know this, but you now have to be on a team first before he joins a private server. You can join from the menu and he can‚Äôt send you an invite from the server itself. He has to be in the main menu and you have to accept first. Then he can proceed to join the server after your on a team together. 
---
Goodluck.
---
When your husband hovers over private world in main screen try to toggle the team join only option. Square on PS4 but you'll see it on the bottom of the screen like fill team on/off in NW
---
A CTF type scenario where you have to capture nuclear keycards and once you get enough it nukes the opposing teams section of the map!
---
I was on PS4.
---
Maybe its more of a platform issue?
---
Yeah hard to vent on here.  My bad though I meant no disrespect.
---
Anyone who farms treasure maps can tell you that it's one of the most efficient ways to gather large amounts of mats for a clan.
---
I debated about Lone Wonderer. My main question is, if I'm doing an event and there are other random people doing the same event, do I still get the Lone Wonderer perks or am I no longer considered alone if there's other people nearby? I guess I should have Googled it.
---
I'm just going to assume you don't have the capacity to examine any mediums aesthetic, tone, themes, setting etc. 
---
If you think rage and fallout are different simply because of mechanics, this conversation is way over your head.
---
Thank you for this! Was talking to a friend about it last week but couldn't remember the title! About age 8 when I saw it üòÇ
---
Found a random squad that were pretty good earlier and I'm half way to the skel suit. We got 2 chicken dinners and a few 2nd and 3rds.
---
It worked thanks for your help
---
I love you too, but 4x more isn't to be scoffed at. Xx
---
You can collect water way quicker from a lake or river. This is really in case you need a couple more waters for a recipe
---
Let's be honest, the games probably been running with a skeleton crew since launch considering the quality of the updates
---
Yes! A fellow Marine Tactical Helmet builder! Most days I get at least 1000 caps from building those things. The guns and armor I get all get scrapped because my .50 needs her steel.
---
This does require going to Grafton High School all the damn time for rubber, but what the hell.
---
No, you are.
---
This is exactly what we needed to do.
---
Ahhh Grafton High interesting. I hit up all the theme parks for the basketball stands and for the toys.
---
Awesome, good to hear!
---
It happens have had multiple "scorch" events not spawn any holiday scorch
---
I‚Äôm thinking there are a lot of new players right now because of the trial period.
---
Traditionaly it is considered extremely dishonorable to camp in a pvp game.  The thought being that anyone can do it and it gives you an edge in ‚Äúlast man standing‚Äù type games.  Personally I find these people on this board proudly proclaiming themselves campers or ‚Äúbush Wookiee‚Äôs‚Äù laughable and lame.  I don‚Äôt NW though so maybe it‚Äôs not as lame as I think, particularly with this non pvp engine and the pc cheats goin on.  If you‚Äôre just after rewards it makes sense.
---
Forgot about the mining in glassed, thanks for the reminder!!
---
If you're on this weekend am est time, look me up, ign raskol. You should have a mic though, as it's really difficult to express your needs/wants via emotes. Could give you a quick tour of the different areas of the map though. Level 129 so I could help with stuff, but if you're just starting out, you don't really need help, you just need to follow the early quests.
---
Thats good to hear. Despite everything this game has been through I'm glad to hear people are still giving it a chance. Underneath it all it's a cool journey.  Hopefully I'll be able to pick it back up and enjoy it. Thanks for the response.
---
Same here once and now at level 140 it hasn't triggered again yet
---
So you have 30 characters? Find the time to eat something mate.
---
You're welcome!
---
Yeah i know all of this already also i do have a mic but now that ive tried the game for about 2 hours on pc i think im going to stay on console, the game is verrry glitchy and buggy on pc and not as much at all on console so idk.
---
ranked, but the second best place is " not to bad, but have low spawn rates" .. wut?
---
look at the post on hot for idea's
---
Very, Very Helpful.  Thank you.
---
Yeah but everyone can do that, you‚Äôre not being particularly crafty. The real badass pvp player charges head on into fights with multiple players and wrecks them.
---
That is the 5 out of 6, 1 being the highest.
---
I sell them for 20 caps and they almost never stay in the Vendor for a day, so definitely people still find them valuable
---
I think that was part of a NW event?
---
You can bet your ass they‚Äôll follow through with anything fallout 1st and that‚Äôs a cash cow. People will basically be forced to subscribe if they want more space now. The free samples have passed, they now know what to monetize on and will NEVER let go
---
I am glad it helped :)
---
That's disgusting, OP.
---
/s
---
so number 1 is the worst and 6 is the best...k k

There's a room off the gym, if I remember correctly, that has a load of balls. Really fast rubber run.
---
The crafted versions have different drop rates compared to the dropped versions for the rarer plans.  For example if you want the rare mounted creatures that come out of large gifts and just go off of the dropped ones you only have a 0.6% chance per gift, while if you craft them you bump that up to over 2% per gift.
---
im looking for better gear.  Also might as well get xp while its double
---
Did the tunnel twice found 3 or 4 jinglers got level 20ish legendary gear.  
---
Anywhere to go to find higher level gear or scorched?
---
Not sure if I can do a fissure site yet.  Up to level 49 but havent shot at a scorch beast in a while not sure if I can kill it.
---
its easy when everyone is venting at the same exact thing, not so easy when everyone else wants to vent about something else or if you love the object everyone else is venting about. I have played with teams that knew what they were doing and I assumed their normal person was just not able to be on I wish the two mins could be used to chat with people and see if they are even people you would want to team with.
---
Probably over the next few months.
---
Aid item? Berry mentats? What is this magical item? Can't believe i don't know anyrhing about this yet.
---
Surprise
---
Ya. It‚Äôs in back of the gym. The gym also has a big square container full of basketballs too, iirc.
---
This.

St. Patrick's day super mutant leprechauns would be great! They are already green if maybe a little big üòÅ
---
Put them in a leprechaun suit thats way too small. Lol
---
Because the people that want to play will play regardless. Clearly they will. Because the game is broken and they're still playing. If they want to get more players, they need to fix the game. They should fix the game because, you know, you don't release $60+ broken games. Unless you're Bethesda apparently because people still buy their broken games for full price and don't complain. So Bethesda keeps going treating their customers like shit because their customers don't care.
---
Dummy Discord question here. 
---
I have looked at Discord a few times, following links from subreddits or whatever. 
---
Each time I can see people chatting but anything I type doesn't enter the chat log. 
---
Are you required to make an account to use it? Because if I just try to use it as I see it, it doesn't appear to work *at all*--yet I am never nagged to, like, make an account.
---
On Xbox we had to join as a team and join private world that way- you have to switch the settings to team only or something. I just toggled it back and forth until it let us in
---
For people wondering about drop rate, I made about 100 large gifts (high quality wrapping paper) and opened them myself (yes I'm naughty). I got two of these so far. And 8 icicles. Hope that helps.
---
You have to pre-form the team first in the main menu, make sure the Private World is set to team only or all-friends (depending on which you want), but the text is counter-intuitive, showing the one that is off instead of the one that is on.
---
[It's a legitimate strategy.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/689/518/b1c.jpg)
---
I scrip until I hit my daily limit and I‚Äôve been passing them out to low levels too!
---
Okay sure, on reflection I can see where you‚Äôre going with this. I think if it was permanent eventually it would stop working, although if you could buy scrip maybe not, but yeah if the pool of rare items you could gamble for increased occasionally it could have real legs.
---
We should have stockings that people can ~~leave~~ crap in
---
wut? Glassed Cavern has continuous groups of scorched spawning.
---
These guys have gave great advice on one strat for gathering stable flux. its the picking alternative. it works well and can quickly get you a specific flux you need. 
---
I use the second strat.  I grind the queen. I get a nuke card and launch and queen kill every 30 minutes back to back. you can do it 3 times per server. I can do a silo run in less than 15 minutes but I have to sprint every where ignore a lot of mobs and lootable junk in the silos. for me at level 376 with top end gear I take about 30 minutes per nuke launch. I loot my way through the silo and the entire endevour is 100% profit from front to back. 
---
I use my stable flux to make serum recipes. if I need a particular stable flux I just stop using that type of flux untill I have it. 
---
each time you complete the mission for killing the queen you get 3 to 5 stable flux. the selection is pretty random so sometimes you can go long stretches without getting that particular stableflux you're after. however you spend less time recovering from rads and disease. While I do enjoy the occasional frolic in the nuke zone I find just grinding the queen to require less micromanagement and to be less tedious. admittedly the yield is less predictable though.
---
Damn. That is SUPER rare. Not part of some NV event.. that's a rare drop. Congrats!
---
Favorites menu, LB. Or whatever it is on your system.
---
I‚Äôve gotten mine from the moth man event at the landview lighthouse
---
I'm dropping legendaries likes it's nothing for them. Getting a lot of them. No nukashine here. I drank it all.
---
I get all three. Seems like lowest also giving head plans. 
---
HEADS UP!! 1000 max script limit. The large give purveyor scripts sometimes so watch you limits!
---
scrap box is in the build menu right next to your regular stash box. 
---
for me on PC i open the scroll wheel and theres an option to push T to place my survival camp.
---
It‚Äôs so evil, I love it.   My fianc√© likes putting them in the punch bowl at his camp.  üòÇ
---
If you have 1st. The scrap box is through the build menu. Same tab as the stash box, I believe. 
---
Camp on xbox is built by using your dpad and look at option at bottom. One is place they survival camp/tent
---
It's rare, but I've seen a few. One guy was just mowing down anyone he came across on one server. I'm thinking he was cheating or using some kind of exploit because guys much higher level them him were just getting destroyed. I was just on my way to a quest objective, saw him coming, waved, and he stabbed me through the chest with a mole miner's gauntlet. That's what I get for being friendly.
---
Much love! Thank you! Can the scrapbox be built in your base?
---
Ok. We must have missed a setting then. We did preform the team but maybe 5 min into play we get booted. Gonna check for settings now.
---
I did this with a new player one time. Drank it along with him, and ended up on opposite ends of the map. Got a good laugh out of it.
---
Nope no gifts yet.
---
You rolled 3000 scrip worth of weapons and think that‚Äôs a lot.  If great guns grew on trees, they wouldn‚Äôt be worth anything.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve turned in over 100k scrip.  Do you use player trading forums?
---
I buy cheap maps whenever i can but i just horde them. I really need to start digging.
---
this is so true. and its important for us not to be greedy 25% increase is alot, not that im against it I would welcome it. but I would honestly just be thrilled to get 10% more, because im at a point in my camp where I cant remove anything more without taking away something important...
---
Ok, we had it on team only. We were a team, we set it up from the main menu, started the game and boom. 5 minutes in buhbye. We are on PS4 if that helps.
---
So after trying this I can't say it works, at least not reliably. Anyone else can confirm or deny?
---
That's a pretty terrible way to say you charged them $10
---
if fallout 1st is a "cash cow" then that would be indicative of the player base accepting it. if Bethesda pushes features that cause the retention to lower then they will back off or change the model. thats just what a business does. noone is going to be "forced" to buy anything, if someone thinks what they offer is a bad deal, they wont buy. Bethesda, (and every other business ever} know how to target the type of people why get jealous or mad at other people for having the better or shinier thing. Bethesda didnt invent this, the video games industry didnt invent this. its just marketing practices.
---
I have 29. Time to put the punch bowl out
---
That's great as my CAMP is close to there. win-win
---
I was in a similar boat, I‚Äôve had the game since last Christmas and played till about lvl 15.  I picked it back up about two weeks ago and made it to lvl 39, all solo.  Once I reconciled my experiences with the story and realized I was supposed to be struggling to survive at first things made a lot more sense.  I‚Äôm glad I picked it back up, I‚Äôm loving it.  Keep at it and you‚Äôll start seeing progression, it did seem to have a huge ability gap till about lvl 30 for me at least and I‚Äôm an uber noob.  People in this sub have been so helpful as well, lots of good advice and people even offering to give/make good gear for me!
---
I don't know man I just took a big diarrhea and I think it's pretty similar to 76
---
The only thing I am seeing is the flamer paint nothing else is showing up in the atom store as free.
---
No, we just got track suits and track jackets. Everything else was a canp item. That hat is a rare drop in adventure mode
---
I‚Äôve noticed when opening them, sometimes you get 500 caps!
---
Nothing; the gifts have the "chem" tag so chemist works on them.
---
Yes it can, I'm not sure which tab, let me check.
---
It‚Äôs not there for me and I have first. Could be a glitch?
---
Happy holidays!
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Thank you, not sure why I got down votes I genuinely didnt know.
---
Because reddit.
---
None yet for me. And that‚Äôs after I scrapped it, rebuilt the station, switched it to look for junk then back to Holiday Treats
---
The more this gets posted the quicker it‚Äôll get fixed people.
---
Not lying, I personally don't know anyone happy with the change. It's great that you like it, and if they were to survey the players you could tell them that. Not sure why you have to be so hostile mate.
---
Anything? I tried the armor bench to see if I could craft the suit and no go
---
I'm at 140, I'll hit 300 mark my words. I took 3 months off since launch
---
Try tinkers?
---
Ghoul crew*
---
Lol O accidentally posted this! But thank you!
---
With the way im doing it, im averaging 5 large, 9 medium, and 16 smalls in under an hour just by crafting and selling. Those are just the extras i get. i spend 30k on one toon on just HQ wrapping paper, 30K on the medium and so on. Craft them all, sell them on the LFG for a small profit to get my caps back. Rinse repeat. Its by far, more efficient to craft then find. I have stockpiled over 120 large, 200 medium, 380 small in over 2 days. Im honestly thinking about stopping at this point. Pretty sure i have more then enough present to get all the plans. Lol
---
Get the fire proof perk lvl 3 and the blast does not even tickle you, don‚Äôt bother wasting ammo when they are in the sky and when they land they turn to butter
---
I agree, played last night and in 5 hours I got probably 50. Same time today after patch, got about 20. Hit the most of the map with a full team jumping to different places, and waiting for the kill.
---
Hey it double xp. Get a higher lvl friend to carry u thru westec with inspirational, well rested, canned meat stew and cranberry relish. Get to lvl 50 and now u have 300 scripting potential. Do it again and u have 450. I'm moving on to my fourth character now just for scrip.
---
That explains some things.
---
You have to get it in atomic shop(free), then it will be in stashbox tab.
---
Wastelanders will bring a slew of buyers
---
Definitely. Im doing my part. Lol. Im running a racket on present crafting at the moment.
---
Because the quad loads more ammo into the gun so u use more not like let‚Äôs say the two shot witch uses one.
---
Make Watoga* a hub for old legendarys again, remember in the old days when watoga was a thriving place. The suitcase was full of junk and ammo and the the station protectron was full of legendarys. Now no one goes there. Well I'm selling my shitty 1-2* armor and 1* weapons Instead of dropping them.  just to feel some nostalgia lol
---
Wait, where do you get this??
---
What I would do?
---
pick one vampiric main weapon and kick bear arms to the curb. max out bullet sheild and blocker - that alone makes you extremely tanky. 
---
use healing mutation and ditch pack rat and traveling pharmacy.  stim packs are heavy and nearly useless while using healing mutation so i sell all stimpacks on the vendor and use quantom cola as an emergency heal, nuka grap can be bought at white spring and will clear rads better than radaway without the penalty to your immune system.  to supplement that I would ditch all of your end perks and replace them with fireproof and 1 point in sunkissed.  fireproof has a huge impact in how easily battles with scorch beasts and the queen becomes. fireproof is a must have for any build for me. period. 
---
sunkissed is a must have for any build for me as well. it heals rad damage in sunlight. this means less need for radaway, which means less need for antibiotics and disease cures. every time you use a radaway your imune system drops. so replace those with nuka grapes. when you do pick up a disease use antibiotivcs only because they boost your immunity by 50% . get pharma farmer maxed to keep a setady supply of anti bitotics. 
---
I only use green thumb in the perception tree but I could see having at least three in there for lock picking. 
---
end I already explained. I would use none of the things you have in endurance currently. 
---
supressor is poop. tenderizer is poop. travel agent i keep but i wouldnt consider it essential. lone wander is essential for me. combine that with bullet sheild, blocker, and a good vampiric heavy and you can face tank the queen and the bog with impunity. I can solo the queen with my vamp ultracite laser gat in about 8 to 12 minutes. thats not top end damage but its constant damage due to not having to heal and just being able to steadily strafe away from all her minons while keeping steady fire on her.  note that is SOLO, typical queen fights on public with randos are around 5 minutes depending on what randos show up. 
---
big nope to power patcher. big nope to gunsmith. I get so many upgraded repair kits from the queen I need to use them to repair my power armor and heavy weapon as a sink. I have about 40 in my stash and another 30 on me. 
---
no firstaid since I dont use stim packs at all. I carry 1 stim pack to res other players. all else I sell. 
---
demolition expert is not worth the hassle. I have tried to make it work 4 times since beta. its fun as hell but the land mines and grenades are extremely expensive to stay stocked up on. I found myself always out of springs screws aluminum etc. its a shame really because I do love me some boom boom. 
---
I also use thru hiker - I also hate cooking so I use melons for food and water - I have herbivore mutation to get better food and water from them and avoid disease.  this allows me to use nuka quantum and grape instead of dstims and radaway. 
---
I have to leave ammosmith 2 on at alltimes now so i dont forget to equip it. 5.56 sells as fast as i make it followed closely by .45 and .308
---
I max pharma farmer - I only take antibiotics - all other chems mean profit. oga BM are must have perks for me. ditch scrounger ditch luck of the draw. luck of the draw was broken last time i checked. the icon appears but if you look at weapon dura closely you will see it has not actually gained any condition. 
---
add super duper maxed. its a camp perk but I leave mine on all the time simply because if I dont I wil forget about it. I make serums. i sell the serums across all 5 characters to easily get cap limit daily in less than 30 minutes. 
---
add 2 points in starched genes. use marsupial birdbones scaley healing factor speed demon herbivore. 
---
I am level 370 I do not pvp this build is bad for that. however you can easily farm the queen bck to back to back, I do not have to cook. ever. I make tons of money selling serums and ammo, I am very lazy and do not really strive to minmax damage.  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)
---
Workshops are good. On private servers anyway. I take everything in the forest. Defend events usually have at least one every wave.

All the santa scorched are legendary and drop legendaries, of all levels. Easy way to farm scrip too. Double xp. It's loads of fun!
---
300 is the hardcore group on Xbox. People who've been there from the beginning and are typically very good.
---
Fallout 76 isn't working as advertised? What a shocking, unexpected turn of events!
---
Seneca rocks of that place that has a static fog spawn. Nothing seems to attack up on th e rocks.
---
i would counter carnivore with herbivore and melons, purified water sells well and requires a seperate keybind. melons are free once you plant about 6 . with carnivore you still have to carry water which gets heavy fast. i can see carnivore being neck and neck with herbivore. for me it comes down to one click food and water and the ability so sell purified water instead of hording / drinking it.
---
Robot vendors are the droids you seek
---
Train stations under misc
---
1000% agreed   Would be great if it didn't use up all of our resources while we did it as well
---
Ive been doing this as well. Lol. I kit them out with guns, ammo, and some armor as well. My camp is right by 76, so i get a lot of freshies wandering by. Running out of shine. Haha
---
Killjoy.
---
wait, so does this mean it's possible that the insane prices I see in player's shops might go down? I've only had the game for a month, but I see shops where okay legendary weapons are being sold $8000+. At first I thought those people were just low-key showing off their valuables, but so many people have those prices I guess people must have the caps to buy them on occasion.
---
Nah I‚Äôm too lame to be banned lol. I finally got in-just took two restarts and some cussin! Sadly tho everywhere I went to get everything is dead üôÑ
---
I'll buy maps that are 50c n under any time I see them
---
Duh! I feel so dumb now. Thank you
---
Np. Did the same thing.
---
It is like that in the beginning for everyone. I actually quit for a while because it was so frustating trying to stay alive. Things didn't get better until level 40 or so. By then I could handle most enemies and keep a steady supply of ammo on hand. The game kinda pushes you to conserve what you have. My dude is level 71 now and it's ingrained in me to conserve ammo even though I could just make more lol
---
Do you think you can craft gifts after the event?
---
I'll buy one of you're on Xbox
---
I have wondered this myself...
---
I'm genuinely surprised that bethesda's community managers haven't cheered you on yet
---
Selling all crap 1 star armor. Holding 2 star IF it's under 2 lbs. Holding 3 if it's under 4lbs. Weapons, idk. It depends. Getting rid of guns cause they weight me down. I have so many fucking presents.
---
Then why did you even bother asking if you're not going to believe anyone anyways?
---
They are well aware of this already, check Official Bethesda forums on occasion...
---
Havnt received one. And i even claimed every workshop on my PS and built a santatron at it. Played for 6 hours and didnt get a single one. Was mildly disappointed. I started making my collectron gather scrap again because it seems more useful at this point.
---
Yeah I domt do it anymore for that reason. I dont care about the armors and the exp is shit so I less I'm super board and sitting g on 90k ammo I'm not going in there.
---
Since mine came from Poseidon they were relatively low level and both of the 2* ones were exterminator weapons which are pretty much useless to me because I don't run across very many mirelurks.
---
Fallout 76 failed before it even got a chance because people were so angry that they were making a FO MMO instead of another single player FO game. The bugs didn't matter, the map they offered didn't matter, none of it mattered because people came into the game with an angry, disappointed mindset. The score for the game was tanked before the game even came out.
---
Thanks a lot.
---
I‚Äôve come across 4 in the last 3 hours. Glasses cavern had 2 that was the best so far.
---
The hunter became the hunted...
---
  I have been playing since beta, I always find content, people who cannot are simply not syncing on their end. no form of entertainment is perfect for everyone. IE I hate golf, ballet, and curling. the difference is I dont go screaming at the fan-bases of those venues because they like something I find ridiculous. 
---
I think having a smoother launch would have given the hater bandwagon far less ammo, but there would have still been a hater bandwagon no matter how well it launched. 
---
I also think competing studios have been launching "astroturf" campaigns in order to sway markets away from 76 into their own venues. while many of the complaints are warranted the amount of hate and toxicity isnt.
---
If linking your Twitch Prime and Xbox account got messed up somehow, you could try contacting Twitch customer support to see if they can take a look at it.  If they are linked correctly, when you goto your Bethesda.net account (in a browser) and check the section that shows linked accounts, you should see both your Xbox Live and Twitch accounts there I believe.  I have Twitch, Xbox, and Playstation icons on that screen.
---
This is a long shot, but do you have any ad-blocker active while on the Bethesda site?  When I linked, I noticed it did a popup that closed itself, so I wonder if the linking process depends on popups being enabled.  Not sure if this is the problem but just a thought.
---
I don't see myself ever saying anything about not believing anyone. And if i did, i don't remember it. The ScrapBox was bugged since it came out, i got Fallout 1st installed. I ask, cuz i don't want any risks of losing anything. We lost it before, might as well encounter another bug when you disable your subscription
---
You shouldn't have been downvoted for asking a simple question, damn. There's a bug where it doubles the presents made. The more you know!
---
I play the game and like it, but I do not begrudge the people who felt disgusted by the constant shenanigans Bethesda has pulled. If you aren't aware of all those things, I won't go into it here, but it's everywhere, so it's easy to google. Some of it was overblown of course, but the fact that it keeps happening is just eye melting madness.
---
&gt;the difference is I dont go screaming at the fan-bases of those venues
---
I don't remember the last time the ballet league tried pulling some sort of BS on the same level of Bethesda, though.
---
you perceive anyone badmouthing the game as a "hater" when there's a multitude of very real issues. I mean, the average person can't not stare at a dumpster fire, much less refrain from commenting on it.
---
I have winter Icicle lights plan...
---
I'm one of the local noobs. I got lucky with this, because the dude drank with me and came to my location, told me how to make it home (I didn't go to far, maybe Whitesprings) and gave me a shitload of goodies too.
---
Willing to sell or trade?
---
It's had a .05% chance to drop before this event, and only has a 5-10% chance from presents. It will go right back to being insanely valuable after the event I bet
---
I doubt it would have mattered. The hatred for this game started as soon as it was announced, long before any bugs or problems came to light. So while all the "10 Reasons Why Fallout 76 SUCKS!!1!" videos on YouTube might have been lighter on content, they'd be just as prevalent, and just as popular.
---
It's dropping pretty off in from the new holiday event. So far I've gotten three of them. You might be able to still get 3 or 4K for it but considering the event goes on for another 2 weeks a lot of the rare plans are going to be worth almost nothing.
---
I see some folks selling it now to squeeze what caps they can before the markets get really flooded. What the final value will be I don‚Äôt think will be known until the event ends.
---
So does it look different? Or is it a camp item?
---
Eh I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been playing it pretty regularly since NW came out and I‚Äôm at 120. It‚Äôs possible but you‚Äôd have to sink hours upon hours into it each day. I can‚Äôt because I have school and a job-it‚Äôs not possible.
---
What is the event called
---
I hate myself for saying it, but I would too.
---
How do you turn that off? Never knew this was a thing. Lol
---
I have been handing out a kitted pistol, leather armor, a hazmat suit and a bottle of Vintage Nukashine. It‚Äôs glorious.
---
It may take a little while, but the value will return.
---
Fully agree.  I blew through 27k caps today on large presents.  It felt great having anything to spend it on.
---
Yeah it makes it very apparent that it's a pretty bad thing.
---
Just to stop the poor guys down vote attack, I too have gotten a gift from my Santatron. Just one small one, but it definitely dropped one in the box yesterday. None since then though.
---
This is the equivalent if a dealer offering someone fentanyl because they are out of weed and telling them theyre bassically the same... And I love it
---
So you have to have an account with a non fallout 76/Bethesda account to get this??   I think that is an awful idea.  Worse than FO1st.
---
I‚Äôm addicted to hearing them.  Normally on 2X exp i do nothing but NW, but I don‚Äôt want to miss those scorched and plans.
---
One Violent Night is great for loot, XP and legendaries.  It‚Äôs the one event that one shotters aren‚Äôt the ones that ruin it, but rather people who try to force the event to end well before the 30 minute timer is up.
---
Under your Xbox display settings.  Just uncheck the HDR box.
---
This post needs more upvotes!  Thanks for the info!
---
Sent you a friend request. Ign is newt341.
---
Having same issue now. Any word on a fix or is this a bug?
---
You should definitely be getting more, especially on a private server. Private circles recycle after being logged out for five minutes so I'd start by logging out and going to a public server for at least 5 minutes then go back in. Hit up Bolton greens, Palace of the winding paths, and Valley Galleria Chris you should definitely get a couple. Then hit the Morgantown airport and go over to work collision courses, set off the flare and you should get one or two more. Log out of your private server, wait another 5 minutes, log back in and do it again.
---
I‚Äôm in xbox, and initially had the same issue. So first I had to make sure it was on team only, then teamed with the hubby. This allowed him to not get kicked second later. Now with all this in mind ... hours later another friend just pops into my server with no team invite(he was wanted there ;) ). What I‚Äôve seen is that folks are literally getting similar and yet very different ways to make this work. Good luck!
---
Sounds like it knows something...
---
I believe it‚Äôs up there with the camo jumpsuit, and the massive loot of jumpsuits and scout masks in drop rate. Definitely descent trade value.
---
Earlier I got 5 one on every round of colision course
---
I think the event is enjoyable also but I don't understand why people seem to be worshiping it? We're just killing scorched like normal with a chance to get some unique plans out of them but it's really no different than what we've been doing from the beginning.
---
having to be coaxed into playing is already a bad indicator. 
---
the fallout universe has a very unique vibe, it doesn't resonate with everyone. at the end of your play period you should buy it if you want to. no one can answer that but you. 
---
you should avoid trying to level fast, 
---
there is no fast leveling strat and trying to hurry in this game is the most surefire way of learning to hate it. 
---
if you have 4 days i would say just play in the forest.  trying to advance completely through the storyline will most likely result in frustration. or it could result in you wanting to know what happens next and hook you. I dont know that there's a right answer to what you're asking.
---
 There are now a lot of legendary scorched when there were basically none before.
---
RNG is weird.
---
That's awesome
---
It's Bethesda RNG so it's strange enough
---
Its wonderful. All the holiday scorched are legendary. I didnt want to post about it in case it was a mistake. Just 1 star but it's great scrip but even better I'm getting tons of guns to play with for different builds.
---
Or you're lying to yourself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Or there were never as many haters as you hoped there were. Right after 1st came out, it was the same 10-15 people constantly reposting the same complaints. They got tired of it, thankfully. I know I was tired of looking at it.
---
You monster, I love it!
---
It‚Äôs fun to get rare plans this easy
---
My Two Shot Fatman needs this.
---
But it‚Äôs also not just this event, it‚Äôs the game as a whole right now.
---
Look and see if it‚Äôs just not selected in your data? I get glitch where I deselect and reselect quest in order to see marker. Otherwise that‚Äôs a bummer
---
fallout 1rst is awesome I love it.
---
I haven't gotten any either.
---
I'm assuming they're legendary because it uses the same logic as how legendary spawns are determined, except these are limited to scorched only, with a different loot pool.
---
I got 112 legendary items today, including a bloody 50cal, an instigating hunting rifle and an anti armor 10mm pistol.  I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
---
missile turrets in my base will occasionally go bananas and one will appear RED, and there will be a rocket war between several of them.
---
I definitely don't miss having to fight for spots to farm, practically everything in public servers is contested or wiped out with these events going on, so I'm very grateful for the private worlds.
---
I've also noticed that my private worlds have been ripe with legendaries lately glad actually respawn when I exit and enter the server again, so that's really nice as well.
---
Horde modes would be amazing!!
---
The repeatable quest just never activates.
---
Yeah that could be, but I got 4 in one run earlier today
---
Yes I'm really hoping the mass frustration will boil over into my real life. Me and my fiance practically never fight. I need something to take out on her by projecting my disappointment and constant feelings of betrayal.
---
Can you do Stings and Things?
---
Explains why I did a solo queen in a couple minutes. Thanks bud
---
why did they add that kind of feature &gt;.&gt;
---
You can also buy wrapping paper from vendors and craft presents to either use or give at the Tinkerers Bench. 1 wrapping paper and 1 adhesive. Using the Chemist perk takes 1 wrapping paper and 2 adhesive, but makes 2 presents. High quality paper(Large Homemade Present) with capped purchase power is 1400 caps. I forget the numbers for the other papers, but I bought all 3 from each vendor and made about 70 presents with one loop of the vendors and maybe 15k caps. Sold water and stimpacks back to get the returned money.
---
Yes!!  I was to be Mrs. Claus
---
No.  Just ghouls. 
---
Zealots will work on not just scorched and scorchbeasts but just about every type of scorched animal as well (I believe scorched yao guai fur some reason didn't make the list)
---
So people wouldnt be killed for flux. Too many people were being  hunted and they were complaining about it, so they made it where you cant now.
---
Perhaps a silly question but have you finished the tadpole challenges?
---
People can't take your flux upon death anymore, it just disappears due to a bug. After the event you better haul ass. Or hide, but better to super run away
---
I think it's a bug actually
---
I would choose the best +1 strength available plus maybe rad resistance, because you will be getting smacked more often. 
---
My melee had leather, combat, metal and urban, because they had great legendary effects, like AP refresh, etc.
---
No,  It is intentional.
---
It happens. Jump to a public world for a couple of minutes and then back to private. It should give you a fresh world.
---
Do not like :(
---
I am happy to finally get those missing wall mounts. But I'm pretty unhappy about the lack of Christmas content. The quality of content has gone down since launch. Fasnacht had outfits, many camp items, recipes. Then meat week had a very tiny amount of outfits, 1 camp item, 1 recipe, 2 weapons. Halloween was better, but still all the camp rewards were just ingame assets. And finally now Christmas. Don't get me wrong, again I'm very happy to get the mounts, but I feel like they were meant to release with Wild Appalachia, and they just held them incase in the future they needed content drop. But no costumes, no recipes. 2 camp plans. Pretty disappointing
---
Wish I thought of this before now honestly
---
I don't think it's really that big of a deal either way.  Personally I'd rather carry water as it never spoils and purified water has 0 rads.  But hey if melons make you happy who am I to argue? :P
---
Yeah. Id rather risk it than not have a chance at all.
---
You just upset the rng gods, friend. There are places I got 2 jingle jangles yesterday that I got none today and places that had none yesterday that I got 3 today. Try again tomorrow and it'll be different again.
---
I agree. Thinking back to before E3 2018 when it was first announced people were furious at the idea of anything MMO and what not. Then there were some youtubers who jumped at the chance to prop up there own channel by creating video after video of all the reasons not to play. Hopefully 2020 will see more positives than negatives but nothing can be ruled out!
---
The holiday event is in full swing; Kill Scorched, get presents.
---
They aren‚Äôt?
---
"Don't not get drunk". Cool, so I'll get drunk.
---
Odd, I've found the exact opposite. Three people went down in the SQB fight I was in today, and I was only able to revive one because others beat me to it in the other two cases.
---
I agree, they should give is outfit to grind the gifts for, make it worth the time
---
All but fond a moth man wing and builf a frog in a jar since I dont have that either.
---
I do too, whether in an event or regular gameplay. Just did it tonight to a level 10 because I just happened to pass through where he was.  (He was doing that protest event in Grafton.)  Used a stimpak, helped him take out a mix of super mutants, ghouls, and robots, which I tried to let him tag first. Then I picked up an automatic pipe rifle that was dropped, and gave him 350 or so rounds for it. Gave me a heart emoji and a thumbs up, then tried to get me to join a team with him. I like solo play, so I went on about my business.
---
I have also been revived many times. Especially during the last Halloween event, I was a new player and went down a lot, couldn't tell you how many times I was recorded by people between level 30 and 500. There are some asshats, but I find most of the player to be pretty decent.
---
Doesn't work so well with a 4k tv. Plus why should 
---
I  bother? Quite easy for Beth to solve on their end. And now with private worlds, all the players who whined it was too dark a few months ago, well they can stick to their public worlds and all their shininess.
---
can confirm more than 12 hours. no gifts. 40 boxing gloves tho.
---
.....oh!  You‚Äôre finally awake!
---
I've gotten coal and fertilizer, sometimes the rate block. after the hot fix earlier I started getting sporting stuff like bats, baseballs, gloves and some teddy bears in addition.  I also had a santatron built in a workshop.
---
not one single gift at all.
---
well the Gatling plasma does not have lower damage, it does not work like a plasma rifle it is 100% energy damage not half ballistic half energy, so it does still have more damage it is a full 234 not divided in any way and should penetrate better.
---
this would be a good mode for a workshop defense type event
---
Smoke weed everyday.
---
At first I thought it was a sham; now I‚Äôm heavily leaning towards getting it.  I‚Äôm lvl 38 so I‚Äôd like the privacy to complete quests without a lvl 270 causing everything that spawns to be 20 levels above me.  Thoughts?
---
&gt;you do not get to tell me how I perceive anything or anyone you are not me.
---
funny of you to say that considering you're telling people not to do the obvious: to point out how bad of a dumpster fire Fo76 is and lumping everyone who does so as a "hater".
---
I also feel like you missed the point. if anything, **we** are the dancers. I've been playing since release and feel more than entitle to "whine" about their baffling incompetence. it doesn't really matter how you feel about the game on a personal level, the only thing that matters is that, from an objective standpoint, it *is* a joke.
---
I had no idea, I wish I had a plethora of caps. I found 5 small presents yesterday and finally one large, one normal and 3 small ones today. I'm going to buy some to make and cross my fingers.
---
well that is what is so weird stabilized dose work on energy weapons now, with the patch they do a lot more damage with it on. But still they do less even if on paper they say they do more, because they fixed the no armor pen bug for energy weapons a while ago.
---
Unfortunately (or fortunately for us non-pvp players) that's how the rewards are set up.  You get more XP for hiding and surviving than for killing players and dying in a blaze of glory.  If they want play styles to change, incentivize the killing of other players with more XP.  The math may also change if lobby times were much shorter.
---
Yeah but I didn‚Äôt start playing till March. üòû
---
Agreed. Private worlds are made for this.
---
its a rite of passage for this game
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Same. Game changer. And to the people who supposedly hate the idea of a FO MMO, you refuse to buy FO1st and yet this feature essentially makes it what you wanted - single player FO - soon with NPC :).
---
This is true, except it‚Äôs never a daily, it‚Äôs a repeatable that‚Äôs must be activated.
---
Pay attention to which mats you use regularly for repairing armor, weapons and crafting ammo. Don't store more than 50 of anything except maybe screws and ballistics fiber. Bull everything else and sell it.
---
Can confirm, match exp is doubled. Duplicate perk card exp is not doubled.
---
Also, just found out - you dont need to server hop or FT to vendors. Just exit menu and re-enter trade and vendor is stocked again.
---
Okay cool..awesome ty
---
Did you finish order of the tadpole? Do the quests show on a personal terminal?
---
How would they wreck anything unless you're shooting back?
---
Its under stash boxes.
---
I started on ps4. The shaders are waaay too bright. and it's really washed out.
---
Every faction vendor has it at train stations and in white springs resort.
---
Where did you find it?
---
Enjoy it you son of a bitch. Feast on your scorched Santa buffet while myself and the other peasants claw each other‚Äôs eyes out for the scraps.
---
No... But free is free. So it's worth the 10 seconds.
---
I didn‚Äôt release how bad I needed a super mutant grinch boss in my life until now.
---
The contents of your chassis go into your inventory if you scrap it.  Just find another chassis and you'll be good to go
---
Np, sorry for the delay. Had a puking child yesterday ;-)
---
I think for junk yeah. Though i have mine se to scrap and he just keeps collecting.
---
They cannot attack you unless you attack back.
---
You literally just described the actual game.  Escorting NPCs, disable stuff, collecting stuff, bosses.
---
Horde modes are basically PvE for multiplayer shooters that dont have an actual PvE mode.  76 does, so a horde mode would be redundant.  You can already group up with people and kill stuff at areas or dungeons, and whatever the various events make you do
---
My mistake it's just under 3 hours.
---
Where do you find wrapping paper?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüëç
---
I had a similar problem.  Even if you do everything think as it asks by linking and claiming I still didn‚Äôt have the loot.  But, I figured out that logging into Bethesda separately and Re-linking twitch fixed it.
---
Dont let him harsh your mellow. It is a great game. If you play it for 1509 hours there are some things you will be annoyed with and they could definitely do a better job with fixes and communication. 
---
I'm thrilled to hear you enjoy the game. Not another like it imo.
---
That's what i did too
---
It needs to be a random spawn
---
Sometimes it glitches and wont let me stim people
---
I have a mule specifically to hold extra stuff.  He lives at Berkeley Station and I either ask a friend or use the blue suitcase on a private server.  Yes there‚Äôs the risk of the cell resetting, but I don‚Äôt dump stuff to transfer and go make a cup of coffee in between.
---
Raising the limit to 200 would be nice.  It can‚Äôt be too high or we‚Äôll have yet another devalued currency and god roll gear will become increasingly common.  Quality gear is the only thing with any real value.  
---
Now that everyone is getting all the rare plans they could want, the value of most went from five figures to nothing in 24 hours.  I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt pay 30k+ for a plasma grenade plan. I had a feeling something like this would occur.
---
My punch bowl at the camp is "Reverse Russian Roulette" in that it has 8 Vintage Nukashine with 1 bourbon and 1 whisky mixed in.  There's a display case right behind the punch bowl that has 4 Nukashines in it with track lights pointing directly at them.  I've seen a surprising number of people hitting the punch bowl, and most of them were not new players.
---
Come to my camp, you'll have an adventure.
---
If you're ps4 I can help ya out.
---
Yeah even once the month runs out it'll be nice to have that stockpile to draw from, even if I can't add anything extra to it.
---
This is the same game that needed to give people a confirmation action to avoid sitting down. A craft all would need at least a three stop, something like
---
Click to craft all - pop up can craft this amount (yes or less) - select amount to okay crafting all
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. This game is brilliant; love the main quest, love all voice acting and the scripts, love all little misc details, like the random encounters, the treasure maps, the re enactors.
---
No.
---
If you dont want to deal with any of that nonsense you can enable pacifist mode in the gameplay options.
---
Sadly xbone
---
i get roughly 20 and hour. i cant even sell them fast enough and all my alts are maxed on scrip
---
This isn't Call of Duty it's Fallout.
---
Good luck out there man :)
---
Fallout 76 is a hot mess. It‚Äôs an absolute mess at times. But damn, it‚Äôs so hot you‚Äôll forgive it every time.
---
I literally just logged out and joined up üòÇ I need that space for this awesome loot I‚Äôm getting!!!
---
they are good for scrapping weapons and armor you get from them, and for junk like black titanium
---
It's the concept that's important here.  If they repeat the wrapping paper system for future events (using appropriately themed crafting materials each time) then they can regularly add cap sinks into the game on semi-regular intervals.  Not too frequently but frequently enough to lower the cap surplus.  The only real issue then is keeping the loot pool each time full of enough new stuff that people want to spend their caps getting everything.
---
Actually, when I first signed in today my camp dropped right on top of a lvl 145 fighting a vindictive moth man!  I got one shot in and got awesome loot, a lvl 50 gauss sniper rifle and marine armor chest plans!!!  That‚Äôs when I first thought I might have to have it üòÄ
---
Dang. Ok it needs to be a random spawn and alone. Habe the required perk cards animal friend and some cases wasteland wander. And a gun with no scope.
---
Easiest spawn point to explain is fast travel to thunder mountain, head north on the road. You will see a flipped van (I think it's on its side?) Its right before the tree with 3 wendigos in it. Sometimes it spawns "the messenger". 
---
That spawn has given me a pet bear, radstag doe, radtoad, attack dog and sloth.
---
Also the lookout tower east of vault 94
---
If there is nothing at the spawns, server hop or leaving the cell will change the spawn (if it's not an event)
---
It‚Äôs just paying for entertainment though, no different than having a beer or a two or a couple rounds of ski ball.  I see your point but I say live and let live!
---
How can you even make 500k?
---
Does your level have anything to do with it? Like a level cap or something?
---
I played it maybe the first month
---
What is the event
---
Lmao. I woulda put a couple mines in them. That's awesome. Hit detection boxes are pretty shitty in fo76 too that doesnt help either.
---
Did this to each of my buddies when they first started lol
---
You have to be at least twice the level of the creature you are trying to tame
---
It has to be 1/2 your lvl I believe. The locations I gave you should be no problem. Spawns in the bog might be a bit high still.
---
Welp, that explains it then. RIP to me getting a cuddly yao guai for a while
---
There is actually a guide on the sub as well if you just type in taming and it‚Äôs a really good guide for taming
---
I used to play it for about 20 hours a week. Now I play for maybe an hour a week
---
Eastern regional penitentiary is awesome
---
It's your private server. If you wanna add randoms to your friends list so they can enjoy a more private session then it's well within your rights.
---
People play this game sober? Hell, people do stuff sober generally?
---
I play as much as I can but I have to divide my time between fallout and art so sometimes I get get more art
---
Multiple in valley galleria glassed cavern national radio astrology whatever and big bend tunnel. More than one each place. Very few 3 stars. Maybe one or two a circle. Seems less after the patch this am too.
---
Probably the only person out there that thinks this
---
I want to play it a lot more it's super fun and I really enjoy the community
---
I'm tempted to move my camp near fissures, and make benches so people can sit and watch the peasants fight for the gifts.
---
Matt, it's been a long week but this comment genuinely made me laugh out loud. Thank you and may the odds forever be in your favor.
---
If you're ever on PC and you need a private yacht to hang out on and shoot those bastards freely, I got you covered.
---
Yup. They will spoil
---
I do that every time I walk into a WalMart or Target anyways...
---
I know I could just Google it. But what the heck is twitch?
---
I play it when the mood strikes, honestly. FO76 is my getaway when I'm getting burned out with WoW or FFXIV. I tend to get really hooked in my sessions but then I'll disappear for a month or few months again.
---
Wait, isn't this a re-post? I swear I read this exact post, word-for-word, earlier today.
---
The siren should do this
---
 They are just huge c\*\*\*s that have nothing better to do.
---
Twitch is a livestreaming service now owned by amazon, primarily used to stream games.
---
Due to amazons now-ownership, they made their amazon prime (a subscription for package related perks) also give you twitch prime for free, which is just an upgrade twitch experience
---
As a part of the twitch prime perks, some games will do partnerships with twitch, where twitch prime members can receive unique loot bundles for various games through their prime membership.
---
When do the scrip vendors reset?  I read 20 hours but seems like it's been more and I still cant sell
---
Thanks for the info! I'll have to try to link my prime to my account then if I'm getting it for free anyway
---
I agree nearly 800 hours in and I'm still enjoying it. Some of the best 29 bucks I ever spent
---
You better! If youve already got prime, all it takes is a few minutes. Plus, there is loot for more than just fallout 76, so youre bound to find some more goodies there somewhere
---
I made some awesome trades on the Bazaar. The Hunters Long Coat was the best one.
---
Ok so I have claimed my twitch rewards.  I'm familiar with doing so on fifa and GTA.  I have not gotten them yet?  Where would I look or how would I know that they are dropped on my console?
---
That's the thing I don't like sometimes you will have 12 people spawn on top of themselves all rushing to the loot boxes if I can find any weapon that's when I hide
---
Just playing.
---
Do it for long enough, stuff just builds up.
---
When you look at me sitting on my hoard you are not seeing a highly skilled individual, just someone who has poured an excessive amount of time and resources into the game.
---
There is no accomplishment to be found here, just another pathology.
---
Pretty much every day
---
Hmm. Just as a bit of troubleshooting, have you made sure that the twitch and bethesda accounts are linked?
---
If so, how long ago did you claim the loot? Id do a complete shutdown of the game and load it back up again for it to hopefully work.
---
And to check, just go to the atomic shop, hit the apparel tab and scroll down slightly until you hit outfits. There should be a clean striped suit there. If its there, everything else is, and you can enjoy! If not, submit a ticket.
---
I'd be happy with 7-7 or 6-6
---
I just came from wavy Willard‚Äôs and got 5 Christmas suited legendaries, male and female. Hunting these jingle bell guys is the most fun to come to this game in long time.
---
Hamburger Hill would be cool!
---
 
---
* Perfectly preserved pie - Worthless, has static spawns
---
* Whitespring Jumpsuit - 5k
---
* Engineer's suit - 500 caps
---
* Halloween Costume Skeleton - worthless, static spawns
---
* Halloween Costume Skull - worthless, static spawns
---
* Jack O Lantern Pant Suit - 5k
---
* Suppressor's Tesla Rifle \*\*\* VATS Critical shots do +50% damage 90% reduced weight Reduce your target's damage by 20% for 3sec - Terrible rolls for a telsa. scrip fodder
---
I want tdm at the Gallaria Mall!
---
Give them a nukashine and tell them to ride a fuzzy ride for the next 2 minutes
---
This would be cool in the city areas.
---
I hope! It looks really nice
---
You can just set the normal one to collect gifts in th ed terminal
---
World of war craft style capture the flag would be love
---
Wow. Thanks for that.
---
You should do an AMA, Innov.
---
I concur. I have the private server and have messaged/invited randoms to it on several occasions. You won‚Äôt be breaking any rules whatsoever.
---
I like your enthusiasm and optimism, you will need both on this journey you about to endure.
---
The pantsuit is worth around 10k in trading groups, 5k is a pretty good steal
---
Daily. Gotta get my possum badges and daily challenges done yo. After that I head to other games.
---
Ok I didn't check the atomic shop previously.  It isn't there and I claimed my reward about 40 mins ago.  I will shut down for the night and check it out tomorrow.  My accounts are linked but did have to reset password.  Thank you for the help and if not there tomorrow I will submit a ticket.  Thank you
---
Glad to help! Fingers crossed its in your account tommorow. Enjoy your sleeping bags!
---
:Nods in agreement:
---
Add in some subways...
---
Yeah most city areas have inside areas and rooftops without loading screens it would be cool.
---
Yeah, you need to create an account. Otherwise it's read-only.
---
The discord link is at the bottom of the spreadsheet in the credits.
---
It is easy to call out incompetence when shrouded in ignorance.
---
&gt;It's OK to be a little bit in both camps.
---
Dude, you're not in both camps. You post obsessively *every day* about how broken and bad it is and you never have a single positive thing to say about the game. You lecture other people about how it's a bad game and they're wrong to think it's a good game. 
---
You're firmly in one camp only. 
---
You've said it's a 3/10 game. Now, if I had a game that I thought was a 3/10, I'd junk it and go play something that I actually liked, rather than spend every day complaining on the internet about it. 
---
But even worse, you don't even have the courage of your own convictions. By logging in and playing, you're supporting Bethesda by keeping the player numbers up. If you really felt strongly about the game, you'd actually boycott it.
---
If a game is that broken and bad that you're making hundreds of posts about how terrible it is - go play something else. Because right now Bethesda have your money, they have your ongoing support, and all you're doing is playing the victim and spending way too much of your life being angry over a video game.
---
Jumpsuit is 5-10K
---
Well the t51 power armor skin came back i assume this will too i just hope they dont charge 2k atoms again for it if it does come back cuz i want the elf set this time and the candy cane cane skin
---
So, if you previously linked your accounts, do you not get the rewards?
---
If you scrap a chassis the pieces go into your inventory
---
Or just have it be irs own instance. Would be so much smother. No environmental loading info
---
I log in and get the daily cap limit on all characters at the bare minimum. its less than 30 minutes. 
---
once I get that handled its usually 4 to 6 hour blocks depending on what life is doing.
---
Great, thanks!
---
Great!  Thanks
---
6 is the most for me. i run pharma farmer and i consider it a drug a palooza!
---
Yea yesterday was like store closing sale lol, i even saved some for today‚Äôs scrip. Today after the server update the drop rate came down, but still better than normal days.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. I figured that had to be the case but it was weird that it didn't spell it out.
---
uncle jerry ??
---
I dunno what a twitch is other than that thing that happens to the outside corner of my left eye.
---
I've been running the big bend tunnel, I usually average around 4 per run. The highest I've seen in one run so far has been 7
---
A purple twitch colored wallpaper would be neat or something.
---
Don't bother, world is full.
---
8 if i remember right
---
As i said in another post, I‚Äôve noticed today after server update the holiday spawn rate cooled down. Still better than nothing though. 
---
For all of you who said ‚Äòit‚Äôs just RNG‚Äô, you‚Äôre half correct. RNG is based on a pre configured rate, that rate makes a huge difference. We‚Äôre saying the rate has been lowered today than yesterday.
---
Use looking for group and keep reading the likes of Reddit.  Really good community that will happily assist and answer any questions. The fact that you didn't mention being overweight amazes me.  We only had 400 max stashes in the beginning.  The kids have it so easy these days
---
i run straight to the nearest pay to win tent and dump that flux in the elitest of all scrap boxes like its hot floop. 
---
if no pay to win tent is present i shout in open mic "PAY TO WIN POWERS ACTIVATE" in my best liberty prime voice and then throw my own tent out :P
---
Currently dropping from gifts.  Kill the scorched wearing xmas stuff.
---
Thank you
---
There is no daily limit on caps earned through a Camp Vendor.  When people talk about hitting their limit, they mean the character limit of 30,000 caps.  Once you hit that amount, you cannot earn or pick up any more caps.  Theoretically, you could price one item at ridiculous prices lime 50,000 caps, and if someone bought it, you'd only earn whatever brought you to the 30,000 limit and anything over is lost to the ether...
---
One can only hope it does
---
I've only seen a measly three. However, they did scare the hell out of me when they followed me home.
---
Currently I‚Äôm leaning heavily toward shotguns over all else, though I admit, this dashing scorched in a winter-y suit gave me my first Shishkebab tonight and I am tempted, but I‚Äôve loved the shotguns since FO3.
---
Admittedly, part of the reason is that I suck at FPS and lean on VATS to compensate for my inability to shoot worth a lick, and shotguns are more forgiving.
---
We're all farming Santa-Scorched, I'm guessing.
---
I am sure they‚Äôre going to be bringing the outfits back from last year- probably next Tuesday or something :)
---
[deleted]
---
I just did one run back and forth through the bog and got 17 legendary items ranging from 3* down. Between SB and SM and scorched.
---
No joke just hit fissure sites all over map. Big bend, Camden park, Morgantown, whitespring.
---
That means that is one you have already gotten. There is a whole 3 part video walk through for this on youtube if you need some direction or help :) hope this helps you.

I saw a bunch of plans in the suitcases at that station today. Some PA and weapon mod plans mostly
---
I got one the first time I logged in after the event started none since. I think the drop rate is just really low. I can't imagine they're going to do another maintenance just for that.
---
This would be a viable solution if we had a shared stash between accounts and didn't need to bother friends or have a dedicated second account just for one game
---
Every day.
---
wait.... they teleport you? I just remember them saying they increase unarmed damage? Gave 1 to a guy that i saw was using fist weapons, and then boom hes gone
---
Good luck! I think it works better if you leave something, like the pre war money, and don‚Äôt loot everything in the box!
---
If it‚Äôs the grenade plan you are tying for just buy lots of small presents (cheap wrapping)
---
Thank god that didn‚Äôt happen to me when I was low-level.
---
Although I did do the same thing to my friend who was, at the time, level 7. Let‚Äôs just say a lot of screaming unfolded as he landed in the mire next to a lot of enemies..
---
Yes.
---
You trying to sell one? PS4?
---
They re-did Morgantowns interior airport a little while back and iirc there's only one entrance that's on the left side of the "arrival" section block in the front. I was just in there today!
---
Confirmed, when ultracite is mined in any area of the game it should spawn from 1-3 scorched. I noticed this a while back during the BOS mission through the glass cavern. I could walk from beginning to end with maybe a few scorched that are static spawns, every time I mined a single node three would come trailing down around the corner, I was not sure at first but I did timed segments from 30 seconds between grabbing each ore and 5 minutes. Essentially when I first did that mission I was way under geared and had a stack or chrisma perks "you know since ever fallout ever had speech checks" in any case I did it slowly one node at a time and than did three and got swarmed. Also reconfirmed today down there and did like 7 at once with a group and about 24 came charging in from our 12 and 6, we then proceeded to basically get as many as we could till it just stopped working. Don't know if it's a server thing or a individual/team thing, and I can not confirm if a server hop would rectify it.
---
Do you have frog mount?
---
Dang, I'm looking for the plan.
---
The 'bad' parts of 76 are mostly technical issues. Bugs, glitches, server issues, performance issues, etc. And boy oh boy is it bad. It's a mess.
---
Now when it comes to gameplay, that's subjective. Some will enjoy it, some won't, like any game. I enjoy the Bethesda gameplay loop, but the technical problems do very much get in the way of my enjoyment. Glad you're enjoying it so far.
---
If you have pacifist on the mutation won't proc PvP. It only will if the Griefer is wanted and you have pacifist off
---
Need anything else?
---
Or scrapping super mutants make some delicious soilent green
---
Yep I found one of those the other day- luckily didn‚Äôt have any junk on me! But you can always try to fast travel out
---
XB1 here, we have seen some shit in the past year with the bugs, glitches, disconnects, pvp exploits, scams, stalking, cheating and bans, cheating and no bans.
---
The game great now, welcome to fallout 76.
---
Snallygaster and um the deer skull. Mirelurk queen and scorchbeasts heads aren't in the game yet right?
---
No idea but I‚Äôm interested to know.
---
I have deer head and skull. You have either of the two I asked about?
---
Blacklist the players that have their camp in your spot and you wont be placed on same server anymore. You'll only have to do it few times until its a guarantee your spot will be available.
---
Ya sure
---
When will you be on
---
 careful there chief. Show up with a pistol and you are gonna get stepped on.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a couple hours now and the tent alone has blown my mind, it‚Äôs sooooooo much easier when you can summon a tent and get rid of all your garbage.  Not having to worry about the weight limit makes adventuring carefree and fun again!
---
I'm on now
---
check your refresh rate isn't at 30Hz
---
Pretty sure 20 is correct and that has been my experience
---
Visiting new places and getting rewarded for it is what makes it cool.
---
Gamertag?
---
if its only 50 caps then why do you keep notating that mr salty salt
---
Yes you can select which one you want for each
---
not true
---
What's yours, I'll join you
---
MojoTeaz
---
Interesting. Are those your pics?
---
dodgy doesnt work with sent or cav. and you can be killed by a headshot with concentrated easily.  One hit to stagger you out of stealth the other to take your head off.
---
April fools? Is that real?
---
true
---
I'll tell you why - because your post makes too much sense!
---
I'm 99% sure it's that your refresh rate is set to 30Hz. It's always the solution to perfect 30 fps
---
The crates and everything else is the same as when it was first released you‚Äôre correct.
---
That also counts for the beeping noises that let you know a orange crate or a nuke briefcase is near. And other things like the terminals not having all the same weapons.
---
lol "you make your own fun"
---
smh
---
Changing to fullscreen instead of borderless fixed it. Weird
---
you call what happened last patch, what? after a long list of mess ups? for over a year now? you're questioning the status quo at this point, friend.
---
not to mention I have experience with the CK from Fo4 and could fix several of the issues still present in the game since the beta within a couple minutes. and in case you're not familiar with the CK, no, I'm not trying to impress you. literally anyone could do it. except the devs, apparently.
---
While I get you're angry with cheaters (who isn'), how does it personally affect you? Nobody's gonna win a pvp duel with those.
---
What I mean there are hundred more reasons to quit, from incompetent patching proces to aggressive monetization, why pick this one particularly?
---
You should invest in a weightless WWR set, or just  give them to other players
---
I‚Äôm only saying I don‚Äôt understand because I didn‚Äôt live through it. Trust me, I‚Äôve had my fair share of games that I‚Äôve been super excited about only for the company to leave the player base out to dry. 
---
What I meant for this post to highlight, if some wanted to take it this way, is that this is where the game should have began! 
---
Sure, every game is going to have bug to begin with, I just personally didn‚Äôt see them in the beginning because I wasn‚Äôt there. The game is fun for a new player a year into the future, which I hope would be a good sign.
---
You dont see them because they are a waste of time.
---
In the Cranberry Bog, where BOS has been around. All their locations have military ammo bags.
---
Another benefit is they don‚Äôt need to be placed on dirt üëç
---
AFAIK; they literally -just- do the obvious thing of making purified water.
---
I believe it's 1 bottle per filter too. Not 100% sure there since like every other player of 76 i've never actually used one, despite playing since beta.
---
Absolutely perfect! üëçüòÇ
---
If it has NW's style of restrictions (no crazy legendaries, just base weapons and armor) I'd be down for it.
---
Killing sheepsquatch, their fur when scrapped has ballistic fiber as well if memory serves me.
---
Oh it's leaps and bounds above its start point. But stick with it for a few patches and I'm sure you'll get an feel of what's wrong.
---
I only commented the way i did because its so common for someone to post that and then everyone jumps on it saying its fine and people just like to hate on stuff. Almost use it as ammunition to drown out dissenting opinions. 
---
Glad you're enjoying it though, it has its moments and I really hope wastelanders is everything the community hopes. Because if it is the game will end up pretty great.
---
Man, I dump this stuff routinely to free up space.
---
It's everywhere.
---
U on pc?
---
Nice photoshop work
---
Xbox?
---
Yea
---
What level are you at the moment? I'll see what I can get you.
---
Lvl 12 but if you have other legendaries you don‚Äôt plan on using I could sell them for blueprints
---
I tend to scrip them myself but if I get anything around 10 - 15 that's actually good I'll let you know.
---
1. No, but they do drop higher level legendaries. 
---
2. Yes. Large presents have more plans in their pool, give caps and I‚Äôve seen some give legendary scrip. Is it worth paying for? No, Scorchy Clauses are everywhere. 
---
3. Nope. They‚Äôre the same items, just acquired differently. 
---
4. Sure, buy your stuff, then sell 1400 caps worth of stuff back. Or, just go kill more Scorchy Clauses and don‚Äôt worry about buying the wraps. 
---
5. There‚Äôs a limited time seasonal event going on, plus double XP. People aren‚Äôt CAMP hopping right now, they‚Äôre doing those things. 
---
6. Hard to say if that‚Äôs even true, but I have been on some servers that are clearly getting to the end of their life and see less...but that could certainly be coincidence.
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôm on rn and should be on for about 2 hours
---
https://youtu.be/w2GPPvyH1Vk
---
If you do craft presents make sure to equip chemist perk which will allow you to craft 2
---
And then he realizes everyone is dead and reboots.  If only we could do the same.
---
by sleep you mean making use of an ingame bed ? 
---
so we could use our free Tent camp no. 2 , to get a quick bed on the spot.
---
Great job üëçüèª
---
Goodbye.
---
&gt;Traditionaly it is considered extremely dishonorable to camp in a pvp game.  The thought being that anyone can do it
---
That's pretty ridiculous thinking for a battle royale mode.
---
The best is to do a little bit of both: Camping only will make the game boring for you and your mates and only being a hunter is the best way to get yourself killed.
---
The asylum has easy 20 ballistic fiber spread out through ammo bags on the upper left side.
---
Yeah. Hope this doesn't happen on consoles.
---
Last night there were 6 full ones and mine made 7.
---
I'm pissed that this can happen on an online game. It can count as an incompetent patching process since this been around for months without getting patched. And is there any reason I shouldn't be pissed off about hackers and rage quit?
---
I would like to say I‚Äôd trust them but RuneScape taught young me its survival of the fittest out there lol
---
Scorched Yao Guai is marked scorched and animal last time I checked so Hunter's works on them too. Hunter's work on SB/SBQ but not on any of the other animals turned into scorched.
---
&gt;Yeah but everyone can do that, you‚Äôre not being particularly crafty.
---
No one in nuclear winter is being crafty.
---
You can sell them for 1 cap each. Best use for them.
---
ITS LITERALLY SITTING RIGHT. THERE.
---
NUKA GRAPE! They could have a bunch of Nuka Grape twitch skins that would fit the color theme and be lore friendly.
---
I had no idea this was a benefit of amazon prime, thank you for the info!
---
Well the entire point of a battle royale mode is to be the last person standing, so why wouldn't it reward for staying alive longer?  It makes no sense to have a mode where the goal is to be the last one alive, then give max XP to the guy who killed six players but died with 15 minutes left in the match.  If the goal is to be the last person standing, then that's what it should reward.  And it's not a simple matter of PVP vs, non-PVP. Like I said, to win the match, you have to be the last man standing.   To win, you only need to fight and win one PVP  fight (the last one).
---
lol, Iove that you watch them go. I just put one in my bowl and when that one is gone, I put in another one. I grabbed some toxic goo to put that in there, sadly didnt work üòï
---
well at least something worked :)
---
Well with work and kids I spend about 3-4 hours a day if I'm lucky!! But the Mrs is out this weekend and the kids to, so I'll be ignoring my real buddies all weekend and be glued to the TV, or until I fall asleep, getting on abit now.
---
Every days, as much as I can. Why ? Because when you start grinding and farming things in that game, you simply cant stop; plus the game is pretty good honnestly.
---
I am help desk level one I am no coder. At my company we use an older custom built  program to link our robots to our pcs to our databases and to our users. every time any of the supporting software has a patch there is always a fresh batch of problems for our programmer nerds to work out. people always bitch and offer up a ton of non constructive criticism, they throw out "terrible IT department"  blah blah blah. and the slightly more than smarter customers always says "why dont you just get rid of X software and get something newer."  and it is not that simple. that software has to work with german, japanese, and american manufacturing robots and link them all to data bases and provide user interfaces to all three languages. replacing the old entrenched robots would cost the company millions per machine. the truth of the matter is due to the number of variables our coders are working with they do a brilliant job. they literally invented this software at our company, there is no one else they can call. just a few of some of the coolest lil nerds you can hang out with. people just trash talk them to no end. people on the ground level have a couple hiccups on the user end interface and they just go ballistic and start screaming like howler monkies on crack, at the end of the day. its because of ignorance.I would love to take the most hateful of our complainers and just sit them behind the desk that has three languages of codes being displayed simultaneously and just challenge them to fix it. 
---
maybe you could fix the source code from fallout 4 easily and quickly, and maybe you could apply that to 76, how about for people on older platforms, how about people on different versions of windows, how about for people in other countries,other languages,  how would it tie in with the inventory databases? I suspect they're running the entire game on VM ware or some sort of virtual server system, how would your fix integrate with that? 
---
end of the day the game runs pretty good for me. I freely admit I have no IDEA whats going on behind those closed doors, so when they have a boo boo I am patient. By all means make a complaint, thats how they know there is a problem, but to call someone incompetent and just be rude and insulting when you don't even fully know the variables they're juggling is just ignorance. I automatically pic the devs side in this equation every time just from what I have seen in the IT world.
---
Can you explain to me what you mean by this, I stopped playing 86 and am starting to get back into it, but not sure what you talking about
---
U got off?
---
Oh I thought you got off I can get back on
---
If your on xbox I can take you on a route to farm all the rarer materials. The things you use etc. Also can give you 250, have loads and I only really use it for repairs.
---
Unfortunately as a dad I can't justify being high having kids but when they're tucked up in bed and it's the weekend I will get drunk asf and troll people with the mic, I can do IT and a few other voices lol. Pvp is hard asf when under the influence I find though.
---
It‚Äôs double XP weekend. Never a better time top level up fast ;)
---
Oh no he died &amp; had to respawn at vault 76. Oh &amp; all that junk he didn‚Äôt even care about cause he‚Äôs new, what a shame he lost it.. 
---
There‚Äôs way better ways you can be trolling... Anyone can start the wasted on nukashine mission that early. Morgantown is a low level area anyway... your bragging cause?
---
it really only matters if I try to pvp with them, peeps have been cheating at pvp since day one so I don't bother. so even if these pics are real it still wouldn't make me quit. if you want good pvp you definitely should go find another game though.
---
Thanks but I‚Äôm from pc, sorry about that!
---
That‚Äôs great to know! Maybe I‚Äôll get higher than 12 this time.
---
thunder mountains has one ballistic bag near the microscope, silos always have a couple when I am doing the nuke run. other places I know are already listed.
---
Easy. Get the well rested bonus by sleeping in a bed, Go to Morgan town airport and kill the scorched and do the event that pops up. Claim any Xmas gifts and legendary weapons. 
---
You will be level 12 in one hour I‚Äôd reckon :)
---
Oh, that seems so easy! I hope I don‚Äôt die quick, though.
---
There is a wood farm/mill just down from vault 76. The Robots will give you wood and there is loads of stacks just laying about. Use the wood chucker perk card if you have unlocked it for double the amount.
---
Aluminium is a bit more tricky, You can tag it in your Pipboy then all the junk that contains it will have a magnifying glass beside it.
---
Lol honestly I was thinking of what the point of this post was too. Nukeshine is one of the first missions I did too
---
I was listening to title screen music for like 10 minutes it was so epic.
---
There‚Äôs a couple lower level places for wood in the forest. WV Lumber and Gilman Lumber. The former is located directly south of Vault 76. It has a few robots that have wood in them and several lootable logs. The latter is far northwest on the map (even has its own little drawing on the map itself.) It‚Äôs also a power armor spawn.  
---
If you have access to a private server of either a benevolent friend or one of your own, Tyler County Dirt Track is a workshop with a node of aluminum. Other than that, I‚Äôm unsure. I know stuff like clocks, aluminum cans, some toys, trays and such have it but I don‚Äôt know spawns for them. Other more knowledgeable folks will know.
---
Bro yes!
---
Lol
---
Don‚Äôt even worry about dying, Just charge in with the machete you pick up leaving the Vault. 
---
Kill everything you see (even the cute critters)
---
If you die you only lose your junk, Just spend your time running around like a crazed lunatic :)
---
I can't tell if you're joking?! It takes me aaages to find even small amounts of it, and I very rarely just stumble across it in the wild; I have to actively farm it. It's a pain! I have taken to just using the free repair kits.
---
Thanks for the answer! *west virginia song starts*
---
Nice to know, thanks! *Country road take me homeeeeee*
---
Its certainly in a much better place than a year ago. As a new player you should enjoy how it is now, but you also need to understand how bad it was for all of us that played at beta. It was pretty bad. Trust me, I want this game to succeed and Ive had some great moments in Appalachia.
---
Best try the market for buying things
---
It still works until you team up with somebody.  If you don't have team mates showing on the bottom left of the screen, it's doing it's thing!!
---
Nukashine. Never again. Worst hangover ever.
---
theres tons of military ammo bags around camp mcclintock
---
once you get to top of the world look for skiing equipment, ski give wood, sticks give aluminium
---
You don't think about getting your char back? Tried rebooting your console? Did you contact Bethesda/PSN support?
---
Characters infos are saved on Beth's servers, it should be possible to restore it.
---
Really??! I rebooted my console but all the options wouldn‚Äôt work, neither did putting in a hard drive with an update file. I totally forgot about support! Im gonna try in a few minutes or so, THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME DEHDJSKWKHAJ
---
Nah, I'm dead serious. 
---
I randomly dump all manner of excess materials away at train stations, and bf is one of them.
---
Welcome to my world. I do that since FO3, and my drug is wine
---
We can put it in bowls again?
---
Yes, if you mean nukashine. Just tried now while writing and it works.
---
Neat. Last time I played we couldnt out anything in the punch bowl.
---
Haha it‚Äôs no different on a 4k tv than it is on any other tv. You bother because TVs aren‚Äôt calibrated to the best settings out of the box for each different situation and room. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt need to change the settings, you do. My private world lighting is perfect
---
Welcome to Appalachia!
---
Ghoulish. I take rad damage that much in this game I may as well take advantage of it.
---
Ah, yes. Forgot that part. Was fixed during wild applachia if I remember it correctly.
---
Niceeeeee, thanks for the advice!.
---
Wish we could add toxic goo tho, to punish the bowl spammers
---
There isn‚Äôt really any tools to modify the code on consoles like you can on a pc. Its one of the main issues with pc gaming.
---
Along with the stupid 1,400 cap limit. I need to make my caps back...I spent them all on gift wrap :/
---
I will gladly pay you for your unwanted bf! If on PS4.
---
Not gonna lie without a community like we have I'd have stopped playing Bugthesda 76 a while ago. The people in the actual game are amazing, back when wastelanders was announced they also said they'd have a free week so me and my fianc√© hopped on to give it a try.
---
Within our first few hours we found ourselves around Morgantown airport and a man named Sebastian (a level 80 something) approached us, gave us some loot like ammo, stimpaks, radaway and over the next few months we'd meet up daily in-game and he'd teach us everything we'd need to know and answered every single question we had, he's been through everything with us from building our first camp to launching our first nuke.
---
Next month me and my fianc√© are getting married and we're gonna be flying Sebastian out, I actually love this community even with the games flaws.
---
"Bug to begin with" every update/patch Bethesda introduces always brings other bugs and some can even be bigger bugs then the one they tried to fix.
---
Fallout 76 is fun, but when stoned it brings it to a whole new level. Putting on Spotify and running around with a QE Harpoon Gun has changed the game for me.
---
Per 20 hours is the same 4 me
---
If you're on PC there's an active text chat community on here https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151 üòÄ
---
Pacifist, don't engage, teleport away, change server or call some pals. PvP is consensual; griefers like these will get bored easily and switch targets.
---
Because it‚Äôs just a means of showing how many hours you‚Äôve played and not actually encouraging people to stay online AFK forever.
---
thank you, yes it does give two. i hope super douper perk works as well ;)
---
 No, since they aren‚Äôt ghouls. Zealots affects scorched.
---
Go to posideon power plant. I got a like 7 presents last time I went there. Plus there's the quest for the extra xp.
---
Dave's not here, man.
---
This event was so freaking cool.
---
I don't think they'll do anything beside maybe featuring the name in their weekly talk
---
Robot train station venders sell it under misc I think. They are pricy but if you are sitting at max cap with nothing else to buy, it makes sense to get em. Equip chemist and craft them into gifts at tinker station for some reason that makes it 2 instead of just one.
---
Wait so you are still a tadpole? That‚Äôs our problem right there.
---
I love this event too, they should apply this logic behind this event to future events. Like next Halloween all the ghouls could have carved pumpkin masks and drop some Halloween outfits, rare plans and candy. Imagine fighting a glowing ghoul wearing a rotting carved pumpkin! Chills...
---
I am selling all my most treasured loot for CHEAP to get my hands on more caps. May end up opening all 100 or so I am sitting on and selling duplicate head mounts so more can get what they don't have yet and I can get more caps to make more gifts to get more CAPS !! AHHHHH
---
They‚Äôre both (last years) atomic shop items c:
---
There's another way to play it?
---
You can do both. You don‚Äôt need to be in the private world all the time, I alternate a lot.
---
Just because people don‚Äôt like pvp doesn‚Äôt mean they should be playing a different game. They want to play *this* game, *without* the pvp or the lag. Don‚Äôt get pissy just because they have money to burn.
---
Oh no question it‚Äôs worth it if ur a serious player. unlimited scrape farms without ppl attacking and storage for it. The tent camp is great. And the atoms
---
I don't play pvp part and don't do workshops so I don't know about the preying..I assume that is the very point of those areas so I don't bother with them. Looting gets me all I need. Wouldn't pvp in adventure mode be more viable than the NW mode?
---
Has anyone had any luck getting plasma grenade plans from any of the gift boxes? I got the plans for plasma mines last night and it gave me some hope that eventually I‚Äôll get the plasma grenade plans.
---
Also, if you‚Äôre on PS4 and you have the plasma grenade plans I‚Äôll wash your car and bake you some cookies for it :)
---
I've ended up on servers I blocked, so it doesn't work!
---
Anything can be a worthy gift if He/She likes that. Look [gift ideas](https://www.fanjackets.com/holiday-gift-ideas.html) for inspiration.
---
Crafted ones have better chance of rare drops shown by the datamine
---
Water filters and the scaly skin mutation are the only two things that require coal.
---
Yes 1000 times yes!  I have my camp in a spot where it's not uncommon for others to place one (the price of wanting to be near a train station), but I would think there are more than 3 servers in existence, so why do I often get placed on the same server several times before it finds one I can use?
---
There ARE more than 3 servers in existence, aren't there?
---
Thank you, I suspect like everything in this game, it may be a tad buggy. That or maybe having players nearby can mess with it perhaps. I'll give it another shot.
---
There‚Äôs a whole datamine of stuff still to come. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8t1f6/atx_update_patch_16/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
A fair bit is Christmas related and we may even see some old Christmas stuff from last year
---
I‚Äôve been forging level 1 brotherhood of steel recon rifles and gifting them at vault 76. Man, they‚Äôre so powerful and the players love them.
---
Are you able to buy the same wrap more than once from a vendor? I read you can leave trade and go back in but it isnt working for me?
---
The fucking fireplace .. YO
---
It's not fixed. They reverted the fix on +250 reloading armor defense. So basically, that skill will again break your first legendary effect, like before.
---
I shut down the game and booted it again, same issue
---
If the quests are in your personal terminal you should be able to talk to the robots to start the quests. If the quests don't start you are screwed.
---
I just ran into this and for me it was a display bug. If I went to a vendor or a possum badge machine, I still had all my stuff it just didn‚Äôt appear in my pip-boy.
---
I can see how it would improve your gaming experience, but it's still fifteen bucks a month to avoid griefers. It just bugs the hell out of me, especially as a recurring cost.
---
That's how they function. 
---
They can produce that much per hour but they can only hold a few at a time. You need to collect it regularly.
---
I once made a camp.
---
Nearby Whitesprings, it had two powered doors, one always open, one by default closed. Open area was labeled "public" with neon signs, the other one was labeled private.
---
Near the private doors there was a stepping pad labeled "no step", and it opened the powered doors. To get in or to see what's in you had to run, and if you got inside the doors closed.
---
There was a single switch in the room. It was labeled "no switch". Switching it turned up the sirens so I knew the dish is served, and killed whoever entered the room.
---
Most of the times these fine folks who completely ignored the labels were giving me a thumbs up sign as they were learning new definition of scorched.
---
as far as the data miners said, its a 1% chance of a gift per roll.
---
thats a very low chance by fallout standards.
---
no not really pvp in adventure mode is extremely pointless and broken.  NW is just as bad from what I hear with people hacking and afking. When I do take a shop I only invest a super bare minimum and if someone takes it they can have it I don't give them more caps for being annoying. also I don't even defend the shop I let the intital wave take it from me. so for a pvper to engage me they first have to clear the mobs the rest of the way out. the pvper loses caps I get quest completion reward for retaking the shop and a warning not to go there. 
---
an attacker at my shop now loses caps and pays me. doesn't get a fight and I just get a chuckle.
---
Is that a question. Its Bethesda, they will always add more stuff to the atom shop.
---
when you reach 7600 hours the game should probably shut off for a little bit and encourage you to take a walk and perhaps go outside for a few minutes.
---
How fo you set two different resolutions. Do you reset res each time you login?
---
I know the max is 5, but if I check back after say 20 minutes, they only have 3. They should technically be maxed at 5 after 5 minutes, maybe a few more minutes if you account for possible server lag, but they only make 1 every 5-6 minutes.
---
If the ‚Äúfeed the people‚Äù event comes around go play that - it rewards cans of stew that give an hour of xp boost.
---
Are they unlocked? Only time I noticed my ones not producing correctly was when I left them unlocked and players where taking my water.
---
They changed the cost of the bulb letter lights, if you‚Äôre using those they have doubled in cost
---
Yeah that the problem the tidy quest wont trigger so never finished it to put it in the computer.
---
Well you can‚Äôt unless you buy 1st and to some people like op and myself it‚Äôs worth the $23 a month. It‚Äôs not too expensive and I like being alone in my own world sometimes, you can‚Äôt have that for free because it costs money to run those instances.
---
Large one holds max 5 so u have to collect them.
---
The drop rate is as good as the drop for the Plasma Grenade plan.

They are but I‚Äôm on a private server so no one else is around :( I keep them unlocked so when on public servers anyone who visits can get some water. I only farm it for myself on my private server.

I sell crappy one stars to the vendors when I run out of scrip.

allright in that case i have no clue
---
Could be mothman needing a drink of purafied water....
---
Could be something up with the private server you are currently on. Or Bethesda broke something again.
---
Yes! Hitting all the fissures, big bend tunnel, point plesant, collision course, etc.
---
They are not bugged. The 60/h is shared between all your purifiers, it's not unique to each.
---
I usually use the rule of thumb of waiting 5 seconds before searching again, 95% of the time it worked to find a new server.

How can people build huge mansions but I have a few things,and my budget is full?

I‚Äôve had so many hours playing this game and was sorely disappointed in my melee skills right out of the vault the second time around. She‚Äôs now level 70+ (double xp events are a great way to level), but the memory of that tick still haunts her.

Side note: my GT is same as here. Add me and we can play through some stuff together.
---
Nobody drinks from mine! It's up north, come visit the general store and hit the tavern!
---
Yeah it can happen in the white springs golf club too
---
Really, I am sorry for laughing but that is about the funniest thing I have heard in a while. ....with a pipe pistol!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Also can add from myself, that dozens (maybe hundreds) of people in our Russian community know that Delt is a fair player. He helped many people in different ways. Spent so much time in the game and got a ban for what? For broken server? Looks like it's ok when cheaters spoil almost every single match in NW without getting banned. But in this case they can't even give a proper anwer. Amazing!
---
Basically, you think my build sucks and I need to change it completely! Haha, honestly I really appreciate your comment bc I've never really used most of those you suggested. I've also never owned a weapon with the vampire effect so I had to Google it. I'll definitely keep an eye out for one and eventually I'll try your build suggestions when I get enough perk cards. It seems there's a lot of very different approaches for a heavy weapons build. My current explosive weapon sucks against the SBQ so I've never taken one down, even in a group. I pretty much just ignore it now. When I get a good non explosive heavy, I'll start working on your suggestions. Thank you for your help!
---
I'd rather get random stuff than anything Twitch-branded. Purple, fine, but that's the extent of it.
---
Thanks,  that's likely the problem. 
---
Thst really really sucks though

True

This is true, all large purifiers share the same storage space. Once the weight limit is reached they stop storing more in all of them.  Not sure if it's still the case but it used to be that small, large and industrial all have different storage. So you could do one of each size and come back to more water.
---
That works, our mind doesn't recognize the do not. It will be do drink and thus they will
---
Just cause you have first doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get excused from everything, I have a really hard time believing you found an undiscovered bug that would only happen because of server lag, on a private server.
---
I‚Äôve been waiting to see a post like this. It is rarely discussed (maybe posts are taken down for speaking about drugs?)
---
Anyways, playing video games stoned is the best. Seriously, there‚Äôs not much else to say.
---
I dont know? I mean, 50 caps is a lot I guess compared to.other ways go earn caps in the game via combat. So I guess that makes it worthwhile. My reason for notating it changed with each notation, sometimes salty, other times resigning my fate to ignorance. I think it's pretty obvious if you read the threads in context.
---
I get it from people
---
Story of my life
---
No theme, what?? It‚Äôs the military business man camper‚Äôs holiday dream!
---
Large and medium
---
if you can make 5.56, you can make caps. They will all sell within minutes you put them up for 1ea.
---
undiscovered bug? i't not someones' problem is this a bug or really special soft. the guy just asked to check and explain. Is it difficult to write an answer? For 2 weeks.   
---
Or maybe someone doesn't have proper tools to track real hackers?
---
He's thinking that it may of been someone on the server before him that may have done something to break the server becasue Beth reuses the servers and doesn't reset the private servers after use.
---
I don't think he believes he should be given special treatment for being a 1st.  I didn't get that feeling at all from the post.  He seems upset that his sub is being wasted.
---
I mean that is a year of playing day and night every hour so I think it will take a few years before anyone gets their
---
Coal a big use in crafting a few different mutation serums if you have the right plans. Then in return sell those serums to vendor bots for 450-500 caps each. 
---
Coal one of the harder junk items to acquire beside this event.
---
Well he should‚Äôve thought about that before he bought all those armor pieces.
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing because most of the places The scorch hangout is where the new wastelanders are going to be
---
In big bend tunnels I found all the legendary scorch headless unclothed and invincible. So hard to walk past a unkillable enemy when you can hear the jiggle bells
---
This is probably the evilest thing this entire community has ever seen.
---
It's just a visual bug. Happens to me as well.  If you hop servers a lot of the time they will show back up in the pip boy
---
And that or they were banned for one instance, seems off.
---
The only thing that‚Äôs been known to do this is buying things with caps at the purveyor, which he probably did and he‚Äôs trying to beg this sub to be on his side.
---
üò≠
---
The psychology of this game is centered around, essentially, gambling.  In exchange for play time you get a chance to get the most sought after 3* legendaries from enemies and the purveyor, or rare plans from events and now scorched.
---
With the age of the game and the amount of time that has passed since any new content is added the total number of wanted plans and legendaries is going down every day, and when a player obtains all of their wanted plans and legendaries, the incentive to continue to play drops exponentially.
---
The scrip limit is in place to prevent players from endlessly grinding the purveyor until the game is flooded with god rolls, which would remove the incentive to play for any player motivated by obtaining legendary gear.
---
The cap limit is in place to prevent inflation; if it wasn't there someone could endlessly grind enemy loot and everyone would have a million caps.  This is a problem now with most veteran players running out of things to spend caps on, it would be amplified 1000x if the limits were removed.
---
tl;dr removing these limits would ruin the game within a month.
---
I was relying on them to communicate haha. At least the neons are worth using again I guess :)
---
They will still be around. They already said this
---
I am not sure how being drunk as fuck and acting like an asshat is better than being high.
---
...wut? He said 6. How do you get 30?
---
Armor pieces? What armor pieces? He bought just 1 3\* leg (it was a gun btw)  
---
left the server and bought other stuff FOR scrips. It means he bought only one BROKEN leg. If he would do it consciously what is the reason in buying just 1 leg?
---
Three spawned at or near my CAMP in a two hour (real time) stretch this morning.  Unfortunately, the last one who show up at my CAMP also somehow caused my turrets to start shooting everything in sight including a guy who was shopping.
---
They will definitely at the very least still be a major presence in Cranberry Bog and the caverns they call home.
---
Most I've ever seen were 1 pile of four, 1 pile of three and two individual boxes - all lootable.
---
During the clean up Appalachia community event, people thought that once wastelanders came out there would be no more scorched or schorchbeasts. Bethesda confirmed that they are not going away.
---
Hmm, world of warcraft private servers exist. Perhaps one day, someone with enough drive will grace the community with something very similar.
---
I know mate, I was on for 4hrs earlier and only one sale for 5k lol. It's a madness on the other sub, everyone is liquidating their assets- seeing lots of high end (trade only) weapons, clothing and armour selling for caps, couple of people selling hundreds of thousands of 556 too.
---
You need a proof that my own account is ok? I'm trying to be on his side, cause the guy doesn't speak English and he just created an account and can't post here
---
They are fine.
---
The first night I got six in five minutes from one fissure site...Granted they were all one and two star legendary‚Äôs, I came out of there with four plans I didn‚Äôt previously know.
---
All I can say is I the "gifts" are significantly better on the east side of Appalachia because  the ones near Vault 76 are crap.
---
But how much? Only in the CB?
---
That's what I was hoping, I do like killing them lol
---
It'll be like the fate of the WS jumpsuit
---
Just send a message let them know they can fast travel back to 76 for free. Totally worth the trip pun intended
---
Well the title is somewhat misleading don‚Äôt you think? People can buy all kinds of stuff then get punished for certain activities. A bank robber can say ‚Äòbought Donald duck mask and got prison time‚Äô. I have no idea what the player did but I would think Bethesda has the ability to detect what a player did and didn‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs like all those ‚ÄòI got banned for picking up a paper bag with a million fluxes in it‚Äô threads. Players here can‚Äôt do anything about it, only Bethesda can help your friend and hope they respond to his tickets üôèüèª
---
Did they say to what extent or just that they will still be here.
---
Sounds like this has been addressed by Bethesda but I love this idea. It would be cool to show the phrasing out of scorched and phasing in of human/ghoul repopulation. So maybe not completely eliminated, but perhaps reduced? Could have some areas with sealed fissures and reduced scorched #s and stick human communities nearby.
---
Are you on pc? I'm also interested if you dump it üòä
---
This helped me out a lot, thank you üëç
---
The peace of mind is priceless üëå
---
Assuming you collect a bunch of raw flux and all the necessary other ingredients to combine with it, just be sure you know where the nearest chemistry workbench is and can get there in a reasonable amount of time.  Otherwise, be sure to have the Good With Salt perk enabled to keep the flux from going inert before you can stabilize it.
---
I stand in my camp for 45 minutes staring at a weapons bench everyone I try this
---
It showed up about an hour later I can craft the suit on the armor bench now
---
Oh no, you are not allowed to say those things around here!
---
Every time i see it I put the game down and do other things. It‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs friendly reminder that video games aren‚Äôt worth our time üëçüèª
---
They work as intended
---
1 purifier would be filled after 5 minutes.
---
10 purifiers should take 50
---
Not sure how many you built but say you have 8, every minute a purified water is deposited into one of them.
---
Clear em out and wait 10 minutes.
---
Check your purifiers and you'll see one with 3, a few with none, a few more with 1, and a couple with 2
---
I cant remember where they posted that comment, but Im pretty sure it just said something like, ‚ÄúThe scorched are here to stay.‚Äù
---
Also, hanging paper snowflakes and snowmen similar to Halloween‚Äôs
---
One account but hours upon hours of play, coal is all I get.  LMAO, I know, its all I  deserve !
---
You're doing the Lords work. A+
---
To be fair, there is nothing for some people to do. On the other hand, there are people who start playing for the first time each day. They have plenty to do, and one of the experiences is taking over a workshop to gather resources. I would bet the goal of a level 5 player taking a workshop in the forest area was not to get attacked by a bloodied level 300 player with the best of everything in the game. 
---
What if your idea came with another built in "feature".  Break in and steal someone's caps, and you can only take the amount you're carrying. Then, the other player gets an instant option to engage you in a private pvp, where you get the exact same health, armor, and weapons. Everyone loses mutations, and it's a one on one fight with combat knives or pipe pistols, no vats, no stealth boys, no stimpaks. If the thief loses, they lose that same amount of caps to the target, and goes to Fallout jail, where they are not allowed to carry a weapon for 30 in game days, like being on probation. Make it a fair fight with something for the antagonist to lose.
---
And no one asks for immediate actions. They could just give an answer. We detected that you were doing this using these. Easy. And nobody would start this discussion. But not. Two weeks and no information. It's not difficult to say even something like "we are still investigating"
---
I do t know what CB means but seeing as they said the main quest will still exist where people have to try and get inoculated and destroy the scorched plague, it wouldn‚Äôt make any sense to get rid of them. 
---
People speculated the same thing when we had the clean up Appalachia event and it was shot down.
---
But I agree with you, that a lot of the current enemies will dwindle due to wastelanders. A bunch of the towns and raider settlements with scorched or super mutants, etc.... will be filled with npcs. Cant wait by the way. Im especially excited to see all of the cabins at top of the world filled with npcs.
---
Wow private servers, or any MMO private servers for that matter. Only time will tell I think.
---
Large only... They're the only ones according to the data mining that have a chance to drop anything.
---
Medium / small for instance don't drop Santa Crash, Icicles, and a bunch of mounted heads
---
&gt; Is this legal at all? Take person‚Äôs money and then ban him without proper explanation. How long are they going to suspect me? A month? A year? A decade? Forever?
---
If you broke the TOS then yes absolutely legal. It can be forever depending on the situation.
---
1 account has 5 characters.
---
I hope so too, I‚Äôve been saving up atoms. I will wear Santa outfit all year if I can. 
---
I‚Äôm still annoyed I missed one Easter egg in the spring also
---
Bethesda is like your incompetent partner at work. He messes up everything, so on the rare occasions when he does something half right, you have to congratulate him.
---
I like t now but wouldn‚Äôt want this to be permanent, it deteriorates the value of lendaries if they are this common
---
Another shhep leaves the flock!

A Magical Lime if you ever want to play
---
I haven't even built a camp yet.. Don't know wjere to put it or even farm the resources for the crafting stuff
---
You would think after half a year they could fix it
---
so did you end up scraping it and getting the plan ? I find myself in your situation and im scared to scrap it dont I need armor perks for better chances to get a plan ?
---
They really drop the ball on this stuff tbh.

Welcome to this reddit. People like to worship everything bethesda does here

Big facts. I put the kids to bed and burn one. I dont run around trolling kids. I might STROLL to the fridge a few times, but i usually get all stoned and run around giving people presents... "Because like i can always just get more man."

He definitely used a third party program to do the exploit

I don't know if others can hear it, but I own it and yes it does make a unique jingle jangle sound.
---
Me too lol
---
Sell everything you find. Even weapons. 
---
(Yes you need to decon them to learn plans, but caps is caps)
---
Don‚Äôt pay more than 1 cap per round of whatever you‚Äôre using. 
---
If you can, kill super mutants. They often have ammo and gunpowder (needed to make your own ammo).
---
They can ban someone for this, but can ignore NW cheaters for months?
---
Well than no issues there friend. Lol.
---
Do you kill the SBQ often? You should have tons of improved repair kits. 
---
White Knight perk is a must in order to enjoy the.game for me. Otherwise, some piece of armor is always ready to fall apart.
---
You mean pirated not official servers, maybe, who knows.
---
1: ‚ÄúFallout 76 is good‚Äù
---
2: ‚ÄúAre you high?!‚Äù
---
3: ‚ÄúActually yes.‚Äù
---
The good reviews finally make sense.
---
Yea after the latest patch i found an empty frame in my inventory, no PA parts nor core, just an empty frame. Dropped it (no recall) and later found another one in my inventory. Very bizarre.
---
I have two plans for it now, how I got it:
---
1. Went to white springs vendors and bought out all their gift wraps (happy to have some bring to spend my caps on now)
---
2. Equipped chemist (INT) and super duper (LCK) cards time max out number of gifts I can craft.
---
3. Went to tinker bench and crafted gifts 
---
4. Go to aid and open gifts - profit
---
If they‚Äôre TSE weapons, they‚Äôre gonna have the same damage numbers as Junkies because Explosive bumps the damage up by 25% (projectile does additional dmg explosive equal to 25% base damage) and so does 2 shot (barring certain weapons like the fatman).
---
Back when two shot explosive was king combat shotgun destroyed the competition.
---
I know, i still have two because a part of me likes to hope. Lol.
---
Super duper hasn‚Äôt worked for me
---
I got the plasma grenade plan from a small gift, they are worth it.
---
I find that explosive shotguns seem really prone to trigger the damage rubberbanding problem due to the simultaneous burst of pellet damage, and that makes them almost useless to me... or at least completely unreliable.  They should drop most enemies in one hit, but instead, it's a half of a half of a half.
---
I found more success with shotguns after going stealth with them, but it still requires me to get very close.  At that point, my pistols outclass them in every possible way, simply because I can headshot everyone at range.
---
Make presents at tinker bench. Was confused when people said chemist perk but it does work.
---
Haha, I bet.  Those weren't exactly easy to come by back then.  I can say for sure I did not scrap mine either as I'm overly cautious when scrapping too. Plus I  always store power armor when I get back to camp, before any scrapping and crafting. I would only be able to scrap the entire frame and not single pieces with it stored.  
---
On a side note, that damn jet pack finally works correctly.  Took long enough.
---
I think, to be fair, most of us have used one. But thats it. Lol.
---
üëçüèª
---
There is a lot of evidence of the use of cheats on NW and bettes doesn‚Äôt accept anything about this, but here the guy took it by mistake, not wanting it too much, since bettes does not reset private servers. The guy admits that he made a mistake, but bethesda all-for-all on it. They would be better at tracking real problems than banning ordinary players. I wonder where everyone is looking.
---
I will freely admit that the game's shortcomings earned it a crap reputation.  
---
Had 76 launched as is, this year, instead of how it was, last year, things would be completely different.  
---
That said, I have 250+ hours, in, my wife 350+.  We got our money's worth!
---
I run both on bordered windows, log in with one (usually on ultra as long as I‚Äôve reset it after the last log in) then change the display settings to low - you get that notification that it will take effect after logging in again - and then open a new instance which will come up in low display mode. Then move one window to my second monitor.
---
You can only have a max of 8 people on a private server. If you want more than just your team, you use all friends. Then you can ‚Äúblock session‚Äù for all you don‚Äôt want on server. But you have to be friends with everyone on your server
---
You get a plan, and you get a plan, everybody gets plans!!!!!  I love seeing new plans around. I can't sell what I have for the life of me...I think it's cause their pretty easy to come by these days! So nice to get new ones!
---
I think you typo-d the price. Its $13 a month.
---
i will try this.
---
That's what I'm thinking, I'm so annoyed that I want it but despite EVERYTHING I still really love the game and the franchise. So conflicted, augh. Thank you clan!
---
Maybe once a week. For like 3 hours.
---
No you cant. The subscription is tied to your Bethesda account, and cannot be shared between different accounts on the same console.
---
Ah you can always fast travel back to Vault 76, don't feel too bad for them
---
Yeah, I remember server hopping for bunker runs. Lol. I got both calibrated shocks that way. 
---
The jetpack is a whole lot better but I still seem to have a hiccup occasionally in certain intensive situations (SBQ or vault raids).  But it‚Äôs a significant amount better. Enough to where it‚Äôs usable again.
---
Dual consoles, we each have the two systems and two gamertags but are able to share the Live sub which lets us share content but I don't know if the First sub counts as "content", you know?
---
So many boxing gloves. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love getting whole giddyup buttercups, but I‚Äôd like some presents.
---
Damnitt, you're ruining my liiiiiiife IcyPuffin. I kid, I was afraid of that but there's my answer! Many thanks to you!
---
Oh! No, it doesnt. You'd hafta get two First Subscriptions. It is tied to you Bethesda account.
---
hopefully i come across \*your\* camp (when i have more caps hahaha
---
I think he meant 6 characters not literally 6 accounts. Unless he bought the game 6 times. 
---
If he has that kind of money he can probably afford to run 6 accounts. What else does he have to do? Dive into his caps McDuck style?
---
Such sad. I appreciate the clarification Korey, thank you!!!

No problem!

It IS fun with friends! Find you in the wasteland!

Did bathesda ever say you would be able to host the server

Read this guys post. It explains how to set up the setting to get the performance you want. Withought just reapeating his post, the settings are really unintuitive, and often you can end up trying to render things that you don't need to.

I just sell them for caps. Get so many but I'm not dropping them that's for sure.
---
the current running theory is that it was supposed to happen when wastelanders dropped.  since wastelanders was delayed its assumed steam was delayed until then
---
More than a fella who thinks a good time is  annoying people.   That's is just sad.
---
I was thinking more like the Gears of War Horde Mode
---
It's a fine game at it's core but theres many game breaking bugs still, for example losing 1700 bullets in your inventory for firing a weapon.
---
 Other than that, the game hasn't seen a meaningful content drop since release with the exception of Nuclear Winter. Wastelanders is coming so we'll see how that goes.
---
Basically if, like me, you spent $100 on day 1 you'd be pretty unimpressed with where's it's gone

I play same times Dino2GunZ add me ill be on today round 3

Nope

I think they mean a horde mode similar to how Gears of War had done it, but that‚Äôs just my take. Not like the actual game at all. Lol
---
Thanks for the answers!
---
 I'm wearing my overalls because I'm milking the fuck out of private servers!

I am scared to try it and there be a bug keeping me from progressing. I hear it is quite the grind.
---
Nice, I found that place yesterday!.
---
The game only costs like $15, you could buy 6 accounts for about the same price as another new release title these days.
---
'As much as i like to believe it, i'll have to see for myself first.' &lt;-- That's you saying you don't believe anyone. (I don't know how to do quotes in Reddit) It may not be the way you meant it but it's the way it comes across. The scrapbox was bugged for 1 day  for a small amount of people. They fixed it immediately and it's worked fine ever since. They even gave the people who fell victim to the bug a bunch of rare scrap that you can only get through vault raids in an attempt to make up for the junk they lost in the bug.

At the bottom of the steps you‚Äôd have to add another flat concrete block base which would connect that single block with the series of blocks behind it.  Then you should be able to remove the steps or whatever else they are attached to.
---
Same here, then I barely get in the top 5 anymore. I wonder if we all tend to stay cautious when we first try something and half the game is just surviving.
---
I can't believe that people are just casually flexing their privileged rights in here. It's so surreal.
---
We found the absolute best farming method to just be fissure sites.  At the site you have the ultracite deposits, each time you harvest one a bunch of scorch will spawn in.  This effect ask STACKS with the number of players there harvesting the veins.  So if 3 players hit a neon you get 3x the scorch spawns.  So we tested it with 6 players and we had well over 15 Christmas spawns plus an ungodly amount of scorch just in one site before we ran out of veins.  We stuck to the mire and savage divide fissure sites so all scorched where high level. 
---
That means we end up with TONS of Christmas scorch and double XP massive gains,  plus the scorch beasts are worth like 1000 xp on my unyielding character so even past level 300 I‚Äôm leveling up hella fast. 
---
This method is by far the best farming in our testing, even stomps events like collision course and is a no brained compared to location farming.
---

I know this person. He would not do this, use a third-party program. For him, this game was like a pleasure, to kill time, he often went into it and he liked it. And here it is not in his vein.
---
Can anybody tell me if the wastelanders expansion will overwrite the existing landscape or not? I have just completed the outlaw robot questline and I would like to know if I have to sprint to the end of the main questline or not.

Will they set it as a side mode like the battle royal mode?
---
That's why I love the horde mode events. It's like brrriiinngg it!
---
You really don't understand the flak this game gets? Are you sure you played it lmao
---
Agreed! I am wondering if there's enough of a base that they'd consider that. So many other services offer the family subs and this would be such a great community thing.

And when uranium fever starts which is right next door join that and pickup/loot everything!
---
bye bye
---
Fortnite and Warframe are free, so there was no risk there if the game was buggy at launch. WoW was one of the first big MMOs of it's time, so it's understandable there'd be a level of issues. Those games also fix their issues very quickly. Fallout 76, doesn't have any of these excuses. It's also, not really an MMO. It's more of a survival game, like ARK, Conan Exiles, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, etc. It's much much closer to those games than an MMO. Plus Bethesda is a Triple A game dev and they've been making games for decades. They don't have the inexperience excuse either. Their shit should've been in order.
---
One comparison I will make to an MMO though, is to Final Fantasy XIV. That game, if you don't know, was goddamn atrocious at launch. So many gameplay and technical problems. Look it up if you're not aware, it's awful. But what did Square Enix do with that game? They literally shut it down and released a brand new game, a brand new version of FFXIV created from the ground up where they learned from their mistakes. They took a huge financial hit to do so, but they did it to give their consumers what they deserve. And today FFXIV is known for being the Best Ongoing Game of the Year.
---
ah rip my dudes. I ended up in the mines when I did the nukashine quest.. at like.. level 10. I got a lung disease so fricken fast lol.
---
For the power armor the lights twinkle on and off and you make a jingle bells sound when you walk around if that helps you decide at all
---
**First idea:** Hover over the trouble-causing item, hit the R key (PC) which should bring up the scrap option, then instead of scrapping hit the T key which allows you to change structural items like foundations or walls into variant types (in your case, you want to turn a concrete ramp into a wood ramp). It's the same process as if you were trying to turn a brick wall into a barn wall. If you're able to do this, it might fix the problem of being unable to select the letters so you can remove them and then hopefully remove the ramp.
---
**Second idea:** As someone else mentioned, sometimes things can't be removed because they act as support for something else (like the lower part of a wall supporting an upper part). In that case you have to figure out what exactly is being supported by the item in question, then give it a new support so you can remove the old one.
---
For example, say I have a metal staircase I can't remove because it's supporting 2nd level floors; I can add a new metal staircase attached to the 2nd level floors in another location, which will give them the support they need so I can remove the original staircase.
---
However, generally an item with letters or other wall decor on it will not count as 'supporting' them, and so can be removed normally (the wall items would simply go to stash). So in this case the support conflict may not be related to the letters; the ramp might be acting as support for something else, like an adjacent or intersecting foundation.
---
If those two fail, I would go with the other person's suggestion to move your camp into non-flat terrain so it busts up into blueprinted chunks. Then find the offender and break it into pieces from the storage screen. I'm sure it'll suck a bit but I've had to do many rebuilds in this game and others, and I generally find the rebuild is nicer. :)
---
&gt;every time you show up 
---
So how often should you check them to profit the most out of it?
---
Only losers get high
---
When there are 4 or 5 people at UF and the spawn rate is high I've actually been able to hit very close to max caps (with Hard bargain 3 and high charisma) from selling all the weapons, meat, and junk they drop.
---
Surviving is definitely the name of the game in NW. I played a match this morning, and was a Bush Wookie in the middle of the map, at the end it was a solo unarmed me wearing a vault suit, and two people from the same team with mini guns and combat armor.
---
The map was now probably 100 in game feet wide, and while the other two were looking around and checking their Pip Boys, I ran between them and into the storm.
---
The holiday PA definitely causes some stray rounds to be directed my way
---
Fortunately, Whitespring is relatively safe, with all the Sentry Bots, Protectrons, and Assaultrons. The ghouls are a problem though.
---
This is good advice. I price most of my ammo at 1 cap each. Give some away for free too.
---
Newsman77 here. Feel free to add me. I'm on pretty much the same time as you. The wasteland is definitely better with friends.
---
probably not because you weren‚Äôt cheating. and if you were you‚Äôd probably still be fine.
---
I mean that's the whole point of pushing it to Q1 of 2020 instead of releasing it Q4 this year. And they may not be AAA but they are by far not a "one man outfit" they are a 2.5 billion dollar company.  And 76 had a rocky start but it's going strong, it started with 1.06 million sales and we are around 2.6 now, that's more than double over the year. If it continues to grow and improve it may end up being one of the best fallout games.
---
I was thinking the other day how easy it would be to copy a smoke machine and have it fart snowflakes out cmon Devs pretty please ü§ó
---
Yeah I understand a room or something but the whole thing??? Lol
---
No, why would it? You'll just get cooked by the storm, or killed by a passing player, and then it's on to the next match.
---
People AFK all of the time in NW.
---
...and The Whitespring, not White Springs.
---
What if that is the case... like it will have a scorched mode then they will add a wastelanders.
---
I lock certain parts of my camp. Usually just a single room with spare benches, bed, and a banjo. Dont like having to wait for someone to finish doing what theyre doing.
---
Bwahaha üòÇüòÇ
---
Fort Defiance is great for aluminum runs. Pick up all the surgical trays around
---
Congrats! I've seen a level 0 win once or twice, and it's always amusing. 
---
I won my first match in the new smaller map by accident, when the other four remaining players all managed to kill themselves simultaneously. (It was hilarious, and I wish I had been recording it.)
---
Nice, thank you!
---
The good stuff, mostly the Atoms and scrap box. But the survival tent thing is actually super cool, I thought I'd be able to play on their server and that's it. Thank you for the insight!
---
Exactly lol. I mean only so much stuff. I was super excited for wastelanders in November and now it's dragging on and on. Get real. Lol how can you expect to get peoples hopes up and keep on pushing it back for them NOT to get burnt out. I have a feeling this free trial weekend is more to tempt new players to get it to account for lost players. Otherwise they probably wouldnt of done it at all.
---
Yeah, I bought a really nice (I thought) 3 * shotgun.  I was so excited until I actually used it.
---
I'm on PC and about to log in if you still need someone to help
---
The lack of any meaningful activities after really exploring and questin through some ok stories really detracts me. Game should have launched as wastelanders plus. Technical side that speaks for itself, tired of these posts,  they feel so fake.
---
PC only or all platforms?
---
Yep, only comes from the Queen of the Hunt daily though
---
They aren't broken. Sometimes they take awhile to register.  You can try closing out the game a restarting.
---
Edit: I shouldn't say not broken. Lol. They do register after awhile though
---
Thanks
---
AFAIK - PC, I'm not too aware on what's happening on consoles.
---
What perks you run? I got a quad explosive double barrel and I have to reload before anyone dies lol. I was melting people at close range with my non explosive shotgun. Maybe explosive isn't the way to go because of range? Maybe try exacutioners I had a low level one and it was pretty good.
---
I have a 3 star instigating shotgun. It's my close quarters secondary weapon. With all the perks applied it stops anything in it's tracks due to the cripple perk. So no, I don't think they're weak. My primary weapon is a 3 star instigating lever.
---
Ikr lol , its like people never played any other game with a gazillion times better holiday event. Its not bad but like? Is this game so starved that scraps is celebrated as the second coming when people were wanting the game to be all snowey . Im prob gonna be spending more time in esos new life festival for the most part.
---
Dude I got the deathtambo skin from Halloween and finally got one junkies swing speed for 800 caps from someone‚Äôs machine. It‚Äôs so good with the eyeball skin lol. I love it.
---
Agreed. The shotguns in FO4 were heavy beasts. I used one for the majority of my first play through.
---
I think it's just so surprising to have something positive to say about the game for once. I've been getting an itch to come back recently after I left when the raids broke everything, and it's somewhat nice. Some of the clunkiness of the game is already hitting in and already saw plenty of bugged NPCs, but at least I haven't had anything game breaking like the damage bug yet and only had one hard crash. The issues are definitely still there but this event seems like just a net positive. At least after the rollback of the +250dr "fix"
---
Best I've gotten from the large holiday gifts was a duplicate plan for a prime lever action receiver, but it's nice to see that good stuff is circulating back out into the world.
---
Back when I still actively played, I was fascinated with lists of major bugs or ridiculously rare things. Stuff like the plans for mods like electro fusion hatchet, or the ultracite gatling laser, or plasma grenades. Maybe one day we are going to get things like the wood mask or marine armor helmet into the game for everybody and not just the cheaters that are still unpunished
---
No worries!
---
And yea I'm pretty sure if they throw down the survival tent you'd be able to make use of it.
---
You are a god-tier player then! Thanks for helping the rest of us.
---
Also, I have the perk that makes the spread wide and accuracy good, I also got lucky, the crosshairs are closer than my lever.
---
What are your specs
---
You guys have all the fun with your fancy script writing 
---
This seems easily tracked, idk why some people even take that risk, especially in this game
---
I have be shotgun family and the double barrel says over 1k damage in the pip boy but it struggles to kill super mutant point blank
---
Just thought of this as a time to share some opinions. I‚Äôm not some hardcore Fallout lover, or some big cooperate hater. I‚Äôm simply calling it like I see it with 76.
---
When you equip it in the atom shop it asks "drop bag, death bag, or both?" You get to choose
---
U know it fam! I be on dat day tripper
---
You all moaned and whined that shotguns were to op and Bethesda did what any other Online game developers do and nerfed it into the ground. Now you know why asking for nerfs are bad. Reap what you sow.
---
Adrenal reaction, nerd rage, enforcer,  shotgun perks x9, skeetshooter, bloody mess.  
---
One shotting glowing ghouls with my quad fire rate combat shotty around nuked WS.  
---
Or bump up your health a bit and kneecap them so the power armour or melee peasants can tag them to share the loot.
---
Thanks I didn‚Äôt know that üëçüèª
---
Unfortunately, it's not new. I saw a video about it last week. Hopefully Bethesda just bans anyone with 4 or 5 stars in their inventory.
---
Yeah I've seen one before, like you though I'm level 300+ and just last week I saw my first yao guai ghoul
---
I‚Äôll take on mobs at Whitesprings solo with a two shot explosive pump action and a double barrel medics no problem...Four leaf clover is the lifesaver and then put medics on top of it.....constantly healing
---
Since the nerf shotguns seem totally useless. I used to have a shotgun build.  Then they introduced the nerf. And it took me at least 5 to 6 shots from very close to kill a supermutant warlord.  Then i switched to automatic rifle build
---
Lol still never saw one of those yet. Sweet. Thought I had seen it all!
---
I see you‚Äôre on PC. 
---
I would love to trade. 
---
Add JoeyHollywood 
---
RemindMe! 10 days
---
I use the heal hotkey instead of stimpacking from the wheel, that doest cause crashes but it good to make sure you don't have diluted stimpacks in inventory as it seems to default to those at the worst times.
---
It was the same feeling I had when I bought the game 50% off a few months back. Awesome game, cool people, and infinite fun.
---
Yeah there is some bugs and glitches but you learn how to work around those prettyyyy quick.
---
Yeah this sucks. I ended up adding more like the other guy said and it works. But I'm so mad I can't remove stairs, I can't remove floors, I can't move them. I would literally have to take my entire camp apart and all I want to do is move stairs to the left, and change one flat floor into the angle floor. But it's impossible. What a shit system.
---
Will the server crash? will the game break because something is inaccessible? What the hell is their reasoning on this?
---
I dunno with combat shotguns I'm easily beating scortched twice my level.
---
Molerats with bombs strapped to them usually show up at Breach and Clear events but not sure if they look like that
---
I've seen them a few times while doing lode baring.
---
Is there a man in the bushes? I don‚Äôt know. Has he got a gun? I don‚Äôt know. Red team go! Red team go!
---
Part of the mole Miner faction. See them at breach and clear a lot
---
Where do you buy it ?
---
Yeah, the shotgun part wasn't the broken part.
---
I just came back too.  Annoyed with myself that I didn't peek in earlier.
---
I wish I had screenshot but it was pretty cool looking like it had a holster on each side with a blinking mine in each. I'm sure I'll see one again, never ran into one at a breach and clear yet
---
Max caps or 1400 caps?
---
I‚Äôll have to look at them better next time I see oneüëçüèª
---
Yup, its bonkerz two people account for about half my deaths, I'm pretty sure they have really good gaming chairs as they always know where to find everyone
---
I've been seeing these a lot recently after patch 16 dont know if it was part of that
---
I know! I was super bummed they pushed back wastelanders. Your probably right about the free trials. Lol
---
Your time machine is malfunctioning... It's December.
---
Omg...Uncle piggy banks I am gunna need you to calm down with that 1 percenter. gibber-gabber.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ kidding! I actually got the game for 5$ on xbox during walmart's violent videogame purge, after already buying it at launch for PC. 
---
I just think he meant across his characters and not on all his accounts, but who am I to judge?
---
I‚Äôve used Fire Breather uniform and a fire axe my entire game this time around
---
They‚Äôre really best at crippling legs and arms and then you switch to a real gun. Shotguns got double dicked when two shot and explosive got nerfed, shotguns got nerfed on top of that.
---
Full sheepsquatch loadout, I love it. 
---
Staff + Imposter Set + SS Imposter Assaultron Head + SS Shard
---
I meant daily max, yes the 1400.
---
Imposter sheepsquatch outfit with mothman cultist headpiece, burning sheepsquatch staff.
---
Beat the Juju out of the non believers.
---
Wastelanders will add new locations, items, weapons, and quests to the game. We will have the Main Overseers Quest we have now alongside a Main Quest for Wastelanders. Everyone will have access to the new Wastelanders update at the same time and the new player's experience will be slightly different than what it is currently. They will see NPCs  and interact with them in the updated Appalachia.
---
Worthless over level 25.
---
Bot vendors
---
That would be really cool
---
The two shot pump is the worst offender with like 3 accuracy
---
Guessing you've never been to Disneyland in October or heard of the movie The Nightmare Before Christmas and therefore aren't making the connection with the fact that the event is called The Nightmare Preceeding Christmas? if it really bothers you just don't play the game till after the first of the year when all the Christmas decorations are gone. Somehow I doubt you're going to do that though you're just here to make a pointless complaint while still playing the game to get those rare drops from the holiday gifts.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
I would go for that, for sure.
---
Atom store purchase from LAST holiday.
---
Do I get a police cruiser and taser?
---
He means in game. It's still october
---
Oooh damn it... so I will loose part of the mistery in exploring abandoned areas... 
---
I have just completed the bandit robot questline and I am exploring the lands on the other side of the mountains... how long till the end of the questline?
---
I‚Äôd like to experience the world without npcs to see the difference with Wastelanders content but I don‚Äôt have much time to play
---
It's a free update that adds 2 npc factions, and some new quests. 
---
Beyond that we really dont know anything. We know what they promised. But...yeah...no.
---
What weve seen though does confirm 2 factions of NPCs and some quests. That's it.
---
A second are you sure prompt is still better on my thumbs then having to press it x amount of times
---
I know, but I had to make this pointless post have something worthwhile in it :P
---
Well i have mentioned them above. And the monitor is 1080p 144hz
---
Yep :).
---
Honestly though walking around in the game stoned is really chill fun
---
time to get 40 radstag head plans!
---
I have not had it work. Chemist doubles the amount you make though.
---
So does chemist
---
It says "occasionally"...those of us who have prayed to RNGesus know what Bethesda's definition of "occasionally" is
---
I have like 30 shotguns, i hope and wait to fix shotguns, i did love my shotgun character but now im doing only melee with that character
---
Yay! Can you get the scorchbeast queen head from them or no?
---
I got sorta burnt out in like April and I haven't played since.... Oops
---
The last bit I read on it had like 5? factions.
---
For first-time offenders I think it would be hilarious if instead of banning them they deleted their camps and took EVERYTHING from every one of the characters on the offending account.every item in their inventory, stash, and all their caps &amp; collectibles such as tadpole badges, scrip, etc. Leaving them homeless, naked, weaponless and broke in the wasteland.
---
I saw a photo of the space station crash site rebuilt as a village... I think many other places will change and I won‚Äôt be able to explore them in time
---
Yao guai ghoul?
---
Better idea (assuming they can build it into the game and make it stable): Crafting specializations, based on your SPECIAL distribution. There can be seven different kinds of scrip, and they can be used in various combinations to make special items. Even then, when you're done, there are random chances to attain various attributes.
---
This is not dissimilar to crafting solutions in other games that disallow one character to build everything, and encourages community and basic economy. Also, just seeing what people build would give Bethesda several good data points encouraging rebalancing of specializations (and we've all been sad to have a build plateau while others down the Scorched Queen solo in a matter of seconds).
---
Thoughts?
---
Yeah they exist!
---
The New Vegas reference is to Shanghai Sally who stole 20 million from the casinos. The thing is most West Virginians recognized her as another west Virginian. So they say the 20 million is hidden in Vault 79. She was most likely working with the US government to build the ultimate treasure trove. With weapons! Money! Science!
---
I‚Äôm just having fun with all these weird low level legendaries. God tier prefixes on a level 1 weapon. Awesome!
---
Never even heard of it. Where did you see it?
---
I remember someone saying Super Duper doesn't work for the presents, only the Chemist Perk
---
Different currencies, it‚Äôs $23 here.
---
Every damn patch
---
My vampire shotgun was great for me in the early game. Made me pretty much invulnerable
---
I see. I misunderstood because im used to seeing different symbols for different currency.
---
I recently borrowed my buddy's Quad FFR Double Barrel to take for a test spin. With all shotgunner perks equipped (literally all), it put down 394 base damage, which was respectable. My results were mixed though... sometimes I could 2 or 3 shot a LVL 68 Warlord, other times I would go through eight rounds with a sizable amount of health left. Other times, they took no damage at all, even in VATS.
---
I wasnt using any VATS perks (Concentrated Fire, Grim Reaper's sprint etc), but I think that would be key to maximize a build with any any shotgun.
---
Chemist works. Ive made 15-20 and not had super duper proc yet.
---
They nerfed it with the hotfix
---
I have a furious combat shotgun and it takes 2-4 blasts for the regular high level enemies like muties and ghouls, even without any shotgun perks loaded. It just chews through mobs. You can really see the payoff from the furious effect. See if you can find one of those around and give it a try?
---
Dont know ive gotten any large from killing them. Only small and regular. Truthfully I though the large was just from crafting.
---
This has been around for a while on PC-- 5 star legendaries, but on level 1. It has nothing to do with this patch.
---
That's a good point.  I used VATS with my shotgun, but if each pellet could potentially proc the crit refill perks, you'd gain a lot of damage that way.
---
I like this event too. I just wish they had put a hour timer on a event that just spawned a bunch of scorched that attacked an area and had the good chance to drop large gifts.
---
I mean if u got that Tesla then for sure my dude, the only requirement is the uniform and to pass the test
---
Maybe... Perhaps just maybe... People are so unhappy with the game.. so unsatisfied that they chose to mod the game to their liking. Maybe.. Just maybe... Bethesda should release an offline only/local coop version of the game so the modders can fix the broken game themselves.????????
---
I have gotten a large gift from the scorched, weirdly enough it was a 1star one, and I killed a 3star by my camp and it gave me a regular present..
---
that is complicated. 
---
Players can sell fraudulent √≠tems to vendor bots, and those resell them‚Ä¶ I've found some like bottlecap mines... 
---
Imagine the scandal that could be, that random legit players (who don't have to know about those stories) were banned for buying items from oficial in-game vendor bots.
---
Do the 5 star items give any ideas about what legendary effects you can apply to the last two stars? Or are they just the ones we've already seen?
---
I don't consider this a deliberate nerf - to me, there's a problem in the way the game is handling damage that puts explosive shotguns *behind* their non-explosive brethren, simply because it either can't deal with all the points of damage occurring at once, or there's some invisible cap in place that's preventing all the hits from counting.
---
If the damage counts like it's supposed to, the nerfed explosive it shouldn't really matter in PvE.  The thing should die regardless.  But it's not, and the way it's not - the way health seems like it gets down to 1 HP, then "corrects" to 50% of what it was over and over again - strikes me as a bug.  How else can one really explain why I can apparently deal 50% of "corrected" damage the first time, and struggle to deal with the remaining 10% in the final shot?  It doesn't make sense.
---
I‚Äôm enjoying giving West Tech a break for awhile. Gotta make the mutants happy too.
---
They also we in Fallout 4 as well. Located at the raider camp where you have to get the daughter's locket for the Abernathy farm quest.
---
As someone who's used shotguns since day 1, I now feel like I need to re-evaluate my life choices.
---
1 run through fort defiance as long as no ones been in recently will get you 3 days worth of daily caps. Straight jackets will sell for 50 or more if you buff charisma and there‚Äôs like 30 in there total. Plus junk and chems. I go here to restock chems with pharma farms as well.
---
Happened to me too. I just tried not dying while some random guy did most of the work. Stopped playing ever since. Too much stress lol.
---
I credit the previously OP (unintended according to Beth) TSE perk set and duping of those shotguns, for the nerf. It almost seemed like they wanted to crack down on dupers and ruin the weapons that were duped as a punishment
---
Same here. My jaw dropped.
---
im gonna go with...bloodied
---
At least shotgan better than fatman /s
---
It was all the people who moaned and flooded the subreddit with posts demanding they nerf TSE that caused this. No nerf is ever small. Every time a dev nerfs something they go overboard. This is why I hate nerfs but the squeaky wheel always gets the grease. Now we all suffer the consequences of the whiny children.
---
Camps were added to the game as an afterthought, probably when they realized the base game needed more hook and that they can make a lot of money from camp cosmetics on the atom shop. So yea, it's not always the most reliable system.
---
Given other limitations like the budget and buildable area, it won't be a major thing in this game until mods are released to fix the problems.
---
I've yet to hear from anyone that Super Duper works on gifts, but Chemist definitely does.
---
That‚Äôs trippy as fuck. I like it.
---
only scorched earth unless you get lucky and find it at a player vendor.
---
FWIW, At L157, I can account on one hand minus a few fingers the number of times I‚ÄòVe intentionally used a decontamination arch.
---
With build i meant Armor, perk cards, mutations, etc.
---
Just remember - good thing often come in small packages :)
---
Maybe... Perhaps just maybe... we shouldn't cater to the players who wreck the game for everyone else.???????????/
---
If memory serves me right you actually were able to get four or five stars from the SBQ at a very small chance. I had seen a five star legendary someone had about a month after launch and saw another one bout four months ago. Not even good ones. A legendary board and a shovel. So I kinda doubt someone would go out of their way to create a bad five star. But does that mean I am denying people are manually making five stars now? No, it is just that I am quite positive they were possible in game already, but extremely rare.
---
Not yet- currently it‚Äôs the nightmare preceding Christmas for a week then the Christmas rewards will start
---
Clown outfit, fascnacht man mask, and a chainsaw.  Too bad chainsaws max out at L20 though :(
---
grognak outfit (atom shop) and grognak axe.
---
I have one for sale for 500 caps.
---
I avoid going near them as I need my rads high for my Bloodied build
---
It‚Äôs apparently not in the loot table
---
The one that spawns at the central nuke silo is normally a level 76 glowing one, but this one time it was a ghoul variant.
---
I‚Äôm doing pirate outfit plus a meat hook :)
---
I have only gotten the plans one time. Must be pretty rare
---
Which vendors sell it?
---
Are you on Ps4?
---
Yup, it‚Äôs impossible to sell the thousands of shotgun shells I collect while playing because it‚Äôs such a niche build as it is. They should‚Äôve never needed TSE‚Äôs imo..  TSE pump‚Äôs would still be useful &amp; it would vary builds because basically everyone is either bloodied or junkie‚Äôs at this point spare a few select builds a small number of the user base uses. We need to remove some legendary effects or combine them &amp; add a few more that would be useful. I‚Äôve always wanted vanguard for weapons (anti-bloodied) more damage the higher your health.
---
thats what I do.   Equip excavator, take everything I can.   Dont forget the laundry building. Doesn‚Äôt have to be whitesprings though.
---
lower levels can do similar around Morgantown and Helvetia.
---
YES! I AM!
---
Very easy to get great low level loot for new players
---
Like 2 out of 25.  
---
My best gifts.  Plans.  Are coming out of the small gifts though.
---
I got like six last night doing fissure sites. The chances to get one are pretty low.
---
Use a junkie automatic rifle
---
Huh, weird. Ima have to check that out.
---
Haven‚Äôt played since July. I‚Äôve missed a few events.
---
They just need a range buff. They‚Äôre really weak at medium distance, but if you‚Äôre in melee range then they‚Äôre really powerful. But at that point you might as well smack whatever‚Äôs in your way.
---
there's plenty of guides on bloodied heavy guns build
---
Junkies build you wont get as high damage as bloodied but you will have better health and weapons are cheaper
---
Oh no. My combat shotgun is so good I'm one shooting everything
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt. Only chemist works. If super duper worked I‚Äôd know, I‚Äôve crafted a few hundred.
---
You can still run the game through steam, and it works well. It even has full support with my steam link and steam controller for when I feel like playing on my tv. If you want the game just buy it now and add it to your steam library.
---
Good to know. Least that brings their cap value down a bit. Because 700 caps a present is kinda crazy
---
Yeah it‚Äôs broken unless it‚Äôs gonna take three weeks to register. üòâ
---
Yea you‚Äôd think the Skeet Shooter perk at max setting should make the spread reality tight and functions like a slug within 50 yard? Nope definitely not the case. The range and spread is so nerfed you might as well toss some pellets at your enemy with bare hands.
---
If you can, get a friend who's higher level to take you to the Whitesprings, the Burrows, and Glassed Cavern and just have you shoot all of them once or twice then let him do the rest.
---
I saw somewhere on Facebook how you could direct it to gather certain things, but I'm not able to find that option.
---
The number is really meant for the user. To take advantage of the marketed number you have to shoot at your enemies at point blank range, and that either kills or cripples the user himself.
---
I always equip it just in case, but have not as of yet seen it go off.
---
I‚Äôve restored power so many times it almost solves the climate change challenge. 
---
But it never registered the electrician possum.

Add Ulakanakulot_1 and you can explore it yourself .... Will be online in around 2 hours or on another day .... Feel free to visit
---
I know, I just feel they‚Äôre pretty generalized so I wanted to hear the community‚Äôs first hand opinion
---
No, max that was legitimately possible is 4 stars on machete (sacrificial blade mod) or ranged weapons with anti scorched receiver.
---
First night I did this I ran away from everyone I knew when they ran up to me. I couldnt explain why. I felt like they would see me and know I was gone. I found my self just going off in random directions all night. A true Lone Wanderer.
---
That is a pretty hilarious idea.. completely devoid of everything lol..
---
Also, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been said but I think they can‚Äôt figure out how to make the legendaries above a level 1 so not a lot of trade value..
---
Still tho, 76 on PC is wack
---
I was thinking of adding in perks for secondary weapon damage, was leaning shotgun but you just convinced.me to go for pistols.
---
You can learn the plans yes but the mods cannot be learned like plans. They are the physical mod.
---
Can confirm. They do look like that. I do breach and clear every time to get lead and steel ore. They have two regular mines attached to them with a leather strap.
---
Wrecking the game for everyone else?????? You mean like Bethesda did with the last patch that broke all armor in the entire game????? For some strange reason... I think Bethesda maybe... Just maybe... Getting what they deserve.
---
well, people are busy collecting gifts it seems, im sure there's lots of posts in this forum regarding bloodied heavy guns buillds, i've always stayed away from bloodied myself, so not much insight here...except use unyielding armor, unless ofc you use PA
---
This is my [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5d353de&amp;d=l71lu2pg0ph0pi0an2ar2ao0lt2a32l12ir2c72s01ek1la2sg2a72pp2p02po2eu0p10cu0&amp;w=li2&amp;m=cf82a&amp;nw=&amp;n=Bloodied%20Commando%20VATS) 
---
First of all get rid of Admantium Skeleton, Born Survivor and Adrenaline.
---
You don‚Äôt need Adrenaline if you‚Äôre using Gun Fu.    
---
My Bloodied Commando VATS Build is OP.  (Even with 3 Commando Rank 1 perks, good for 30% extra damage).        
---
Blocker is good for ghouls and can swapped with Pack Rat if needed.    
---
If you use VATS use Ground Pounder with Concentrated Fire, Vats uses hipfire! This is a good combo. (Tip: maxed out the VATS perks and Grounder Pounder).    
---
I use the mutation Herbivore and Green Tumb, I can make easily Corn Soup (3 APR), Cranberry Relish (200 AP, 10 XP), Sweet Blackberry Tea and Sweet Tato Stew from my own garden.   
---
Then when you use Rejuvenated and get well hydrated (50 APR), get Tuned (25 APR) and using perks Lone Wanderer (30% APR)/Nerd Rage (15% APR)/Action Boy (45% APR)/Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint, you‚Äôre get so much  AP/APR that you VATS is OP. It‚Äôs beats Marathoner, so you don‚Äôt need it. (also green food weights lighter than meat)
---
I use Stimpack Diluted because it‚Äôs enough for my 20% HP and with Chemist/Super Duper you can get 4x or 8x diluted from 1 stimpack. And diluted weight less.    
---
Also if you‚Äôre playing bloodied, use Radicool gives more Carry Weight for just one perk.    
---
I use a Bloodied Prime Handmade with +33% VATS hit chance and 25% less VATS Action Point cost. It‚Äôs a godly weapon, especially in sneak mode.   
---
With one tap aiming for the head of a Mutant Level 68 and he lost his head and with Gun Fu I make easily +10 headshots in VATS in a row.   
---
My Handmade mods have prefixes as True (Hipfire), suppressor and no scope. I use also 5 Unyielding Sentinel Armor for the SPECIAL points boost! 
---
With the Ground Pounder and hipfire mods you don‚Äôt have to aim anymore shooting outside of VATS. Good luck to you.
---
All of the large gift boxes I‚Äôve received have had worse rewards than the small or regular boxes.  They have been disappointing.
---
MAYBE EVERYONE DESERVES A 5 STAR LEGENDARY ITEM??? Is this insane thinking or what?
---
If you played in beta you bought the game
---
Yeah that sucks
---
Nerd rage and radicool are a must.  Being explosive also run fire proof.
---
Thats where my base used to be until they filled it up and put something there, BASTARDS! My base had unbreakablebfoundations blocking the entrances to this large cave or well it used to be big, and I got outside the map where they put in that bunker and built a house that was under the map with food and water and concrete defensive walls, it was all awesome but then they blocked my base!
---
WEST TEK! 330 per supermutant..:
---
See them more often in the ash heap events
---
Exactly what Player23man said.  If your playing solo, honestly quests while killing everything and always loot the meat.  I forgot to do the whole Camden park quest on my level 36, by the time I finished the guaranteed 4 quests (dross toss, Lucky Mucker, Hotdog eating, Main Camden Quest) I was almost level 39, almost 3 levels from that alone.
---
Uranium fever is great, use a fast firing weapon or shotgun to just tag everything then always collect their meat to cook as higher level meat gives massive exp.
---
Harvesting Mothman eggs from point pleasant gives around 20ish eggs, which is both great cooking exp and caps from selling them.  Plus you get exp from killing scorched and a chance of holiday gifts.
---
I have a BE combat shotgun. I can make it to 1100 damage sometimes. Sadly the range on it is shorter than a melee weapon, anything further than about 5 feet hardly takes any damage. It‚Äôs really sad considering how much damage that shotgun should be doing.
---
So this isn‚Äôt working for me.  Are you sure you‚Äôre still getting the extra 100 lbs?  That would be 200 lbs total?
---
I know and it‚Äôs stupid because I built so much and it was completely scorchbeast proof and I had a nuclear bunker outside the map!
---
Yours are headless? üëÄ
---
This sounds a lot like self justification. Just sayin'.
---
I love shotguns, if only for the crippling effect from the enforcer perk.  It's saved my ass so many times from mobs of high levels...  cripple the lot and finish them off with a Gatling plasma.
---
Update: it has been 24 hours since I got home from work so looks like there is a limit of large per 24 hours. Lame
---
Perhaps you have been bad all year and are only recieving coal, the santatron has looked at your browsing history, he knows!!
---
Thanks for the second half of your post, I have two stealth weapons in my bloodied build (sniper and shotgun) and I tend to rely on the shotgun in buildings/dungeons because of the close quarters. Speed demon + faster reload kept resulting slow reload and I wasn't sure why.
---
Do you happen to know what causes the faster reload to stop working, in which you need to unequip/re-equip the card?
---
No gifts here - came to post this
---
Where did you get it
---
I would go melee/rifle bloodied if I were you. Could sub rifle for shotgun if youre tryimg to move away from perception. 
---
So glad they "fixed" the reload unyielding bug.
---
That's literally most people's issues though, the players shouldn't have to learn work arounds. The problems should be fixed by the developers in a timely manner so the users can enjoy the game as its meant to be...
---
Oops lol. Better get em while you can, most of that dupped stuff from the beginning of the game is still here.
---
Isnt the plan in Harper's ferry regularly?
---
[The gang pitches a tent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idoYCVLh2qI)
---
That is not a bad idea.
---
Bethesda? Who catering to Bethesda?
---
Been running into a lot of headless ghouls at Whitespring, just standing around, being impossibleto kill, haven't seen headless scorched yet.
---
This event is proof positive that the designers are listening to community feedback, following what players do, and create content that players want.
---
Legendary hunting has to be one of the most popular activities for players of all levels, particularly end gamers.  In second place is acquisition of rare plans.
---
What do they do?  Give us a real holiday gift by combining those interests into a fairly common legendary enemy that appears all over the map at all levels.
---
When players start complaining that they have too much of a good thing, you know they did a great job.  Yes, it would be nice to turn in more scrip per day, but at least one in-game currency has to resist inflation.  That being said, the wrapping paper has made me blissfully poor.
---
Radicool for a gun build ?
---
That prob wont happen caus if they did make a reverse bloody (.and what is the drawback that bloody has) it would make snipers crazy. 
---
Im hiding on a roof thanks to marsupial, it would be crazy. At least when i snipe (i run bloody) whrn...if they get to me i dont have full healt to deal with it like your proposal does.
---
I suspect they don't drop if you already know them like the prime receivers.
---
Agreed, I gifted about 20 random plans, stims, water and food to the last low level I saw.
---
I love the look of the pump action so much but I hate it in fallout 76 I wish someone could move it to fallout 4
---
Pre orders could be canceled.
---
I'm finding lots. I haven't opened any yet because I wasn't sure how rare they were.
---
The guns are rare drops. The plans are available at Harpers Ferry or the Whitesprings. Give the number of mods there are to learn you‚Äôll need to build and break down a lot to get them all, you‚Äôll never find enough to learn the mods .
---
I don't want no children soldiers, could I have an adult instead?
---
If you die during an event you're doing,you don't lose any of your loot, only if you die after...
---
I get known ultracite power armor all the time
---
To join another flock...
---
Went to AVR medical and there were 4 legendary Christmas scorched.    Got 1 large gift 1 medium and two small.   
---
Thanks for the location ideas.
---
It doesn‚Äôt need to do the same damage as bloodied, junkie‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt do enough damage unless you‚Äôre a sneak build &amp; bloodied does more damage than possibly could be intended. Bloodied builds can do 1k+ easily with melee‚Äôs there‚Äôs no build in the game that even goes close that‚Äôs my only issue. But yeah I know they likely won‚Äôt do it they don‚Äôt care much for balance besides nerfing TSE‚Äôs into non-existence
---
725 pre nerf range buff
---
I get opposite results, no more than 2 shots for lvl 68 super mutants assuming headshots.  Gotta get close though.
---
I found mine on Graham.
---
There is a spawn in a shack on top of a roof in Berkeley Springs. It‚Äôs on the other side of town from where you spawn in if you fast travel there.
---
I had a fully perked shotgun build I finally gave up on. First the nerf which ok I went from being able to quickly kill anything to having to work a bit harder. But what finally did it for me is the enemy health regen bug. Pumping shots into baddies only to see the life pop back up again once it was below half got annoying fast. I do miss the crippling effect though that could help a lot in a tight spot. Then again with an explosive two barrel I would often enough kill myself. Though some other perks and armor mods helped with that.
---
They are too weak.  End of story.  Not fun to play as a shotgunner at all.  Shot gun should be king at point blank, even moreso than super sledge.  Point Blank should stagger everything except maybe Mirelurk Queen, sheepsquatch, encriptid assaultron, and SBQ.  It staggers nothing.  
---
Long range? Okay.  But 5 feet in front of you, it should be devastating.   Waste of memory space on a game to have useless weapons that have no fun or function.
---
Or simply let us exchange ammo with ammo at the dispenser
---
Pretty much every Bloodied build should have those.
---
Harpers Ferry is the same. Loads of weapons to sell and the vendor is right there.
---
Depends, are you red hatband cops or black hatband cops?
---
Bloodied in general for the strength bonus.
---
I never see that event for some reason, been months.
---
Who the fuck wants to be a lame ass cop when you can be a Ranger, or be in the Enclave/BOS.
---
Buy the plan @ Watoga trainstation. Then craft and scrap till ur fingers hurt.
---
Wdum by that
---
?
---
Yup.
---
And I don't need to waste my ammo carrying a bunch of people in an event who will steal from me if I die. Before or after the event.
---
Y'all thieves want to play dirty. I'm going to keep a low profile, save ammo, get my reward and roll. Too bad loot bags don't contain ammo because y'all high health builds are going to be using a lot more ammo without the help of bloodied builds.
---
Watch your mouth young man, imma be handing u a ticket sir
---
You must be new to life.  Welcome!
---
If you can obtain a BE heavy gun and you have no idea, what the fuck have you been doing?
---
I know, sexy right?
---
The dollar sign is used for other countries dollars as well, the dollar isn‚Äôt used in only one country.
---
mods are 1 time use, and pretty useless if you already learned the plans, you learn the plans by scrapping armor/weapons.
---
Spring season.
---
Ah, so casual cops then.
---
Yeah and apparently the weapons don't do any damage at all. Not sure about the armor though.
---
Ranger Pach here demands your cooperation.
---
That'll be 4.99
---
After New Years
---
I acquired a BE 50 cal awhile ago but I mainly ran a melee build, stopped playing for some time and I just started playing again, never researched good builds for heavy guns hence why I am asking for insight
---
Yeah we be just out there to help all the citizens and stop all the do Gooders
---
Sorry absolutely no idea, tho had been running few SBQ that day so could have been from one of those?
---
that would make sense, but apparently you can only use them to create random gifts for yourself or friends, you can't decide what to put in 'em, afaik
---
Has there been any progress on this?  I'm having same issue and cant find a resolution anywhere.
---
I‚Äôm demanding u to stand down sir
---
So you accidentally shoot some player and you fear he may kill you, he doesn't , so you go find some low levels and grief them basically. 
---
Congrat ...one clap
---
thx
---
https://youtu.be/FjYyIKkRvUU
---
I didnt get to screenshot my finished base or what‚Äôs inside or outside the map!
---
I get the rationale, but saying Y'all seems a little much.  Most of the events I come across whether I participate, or just passing through, the majority of the people there are working towards a common goal together.  It is also common for players to help each other out.  Yes there are those that take advantage of the situation, but it seems like you are kind of going the same route, taking advantage of others work and not contributing.  Seems a little hypocritical.
---
At L15 you can find golf clubs all over and even decent legendary ones in player vendors. Later level get yourself a free All Rise from the watoga mayor quest and for your endgame maybe an Instigating Grognak‚Äôs Axe.
---
As a shotgunner myself the numbers that fly off when you use vats and normally are incorrect. A decent bloodied pump build can do 1k-1.2k
---
Nah for a while they were giving extra keys to people who preordered and somebody gave me their spare key to test drive the beta.
---
I see..... I misunderstood........ Because im used to seeing the other symbols........
---
I enjoyed F76, despite all its technical issues and cashgrab practices. But I didn't get far because the lack of proper story telling. I took a break from the game, but after couple of months of inactivity my account got hacked and sold on some russian website. The hackers used my account for exploiting the game and my account got banned for it. 
---
Thats my experience with the game sofar. Enjoy it while you can. It is an bugy, unsecure and meaningless experience full of hackers and exploiters. Bethesda should stick to singleplayer games.
---
I have found that my 2 shot hardened with built in faster reload outshines any other shotty I tried including my now stashed TSE. With stagger I use it for melee (nose to nose) and find I'm hit way less frequently.  I buy and farm all my ammo tho. I only use it in vert close quarters. Explosive on my Fixer for mid-range and a 2 shot gauss VATs for long range and it works. No shotgun VATs, just blast. Thanks for the Scattershot heads up, seems I can lose the level 2 seemingly useless perk. With speed demon and faster reload I didn't notice it did nothing lol....
---
Well, thats what perma banns are for.
---
That scrapbox has given me a whole new level of vending, i get to be a little junk rat (i stealth so over encumbrance isnt a problem) then i bulk the stuff and sell it for cheaper then the amount you get for selling them to a robot vendor so people literally come to me to get their 1400 caps as well as any other resources they need and it does t burden my stash amount.
---
In my cases I just gave to re-equip the actual gun. Its due to leaving the server and having the gun out.
---
Agreed, seems like leeching to me ;)
---
This lol,
---
Do the eyeballs flop around?
---
Baseball bats are surprisingly good with a decent amount of mods.  There are 2 statics spawns in the morgantown highschool.  One of which is in a display case by the front door.
---
So much this. Please.
---
I‚Äôm torn - really wanted to start a new toon but spending all my time running around killing scorched..
---
Looks like it. Only supermutants now @ Lewisburg.
---
No way. My shotgun wrecks players and enemies alike.
---
That sucks
---
Last night a friend and I went through Big Bend and got about five, about another five at Poseidon, but then didn't see any except a few singles at any other location
---
Yes, the armor plans do, but for some reason prime receiver and shower don't.  I don't know how many queen fights I have done, but I have about 200 repair kits in my stash and they are the only way I have repaired things since they started dropping, so a lot of Queen fights.  Only once did I get the shower and no longer get prime receivers I have learned.
---
Honestly it seems server dependent.  Camden is my yardstick.  I see two or more there and I consider it a good server.
---
I just picked up a AA lvl 1 bat last night. That thing is amazing.
---
I run into then a bunch in the Ash Heap. One or two usually spawn during Breach and Clear.
---
Pistols better.  No question.  Far more fun.  Far more effective at level 50 and beyond.  Shotguns get more and more frustrating the longer you play with them, and absolutely everything sponges up shot after shot after shot with little effect.
---
Pc
---
This game is garbage all the hours of work I put into to getting a two shot explosive pump and it was fucking bugged. A year later and it‚Äôs still bugged.
---
Picked up a level 5 quad 10mm yesterday. Went back to my base and fully modded it and spent 35 caps to fast travel to a new level 5 player to give it to him.
---
Level 341, 185, and 150 toons playing since BETA and can proudly say that I've never once stolen a single loot bag.
---
I'm not a piece of shit so I don't steal people's stuff.....but I am tired of having my shit stolen and realize that I really only need to contribute enough to get my reward from events. Since mats are so important I'm going to be more conservative with mine instead of going the route of being a thieve.
---
I've gone through a couple of servers with a decent amount of the holiday scorch spawning, and others not so much, just seems random to me.
---
Yes, today killing a ghoul, I just take him a little of his health bar.
---
Chrismtas items start on the 17th. They readded the haloween rewards for people who didn't get it last time
---
Just building it requires higher level components ie stable fluxes that are obtained in nuke zones etc. What level are you?
---
I can go a while without seeing any then hit about 4-5 in a area. It's just random. If you get frustrated just take a break and do something else.
---
I just with they'd add scrap boxes to the Whitespring and the Enclave.
---
I‚Äôve never really done a shotty build but one time I decided to play around with a TS shotgun I picked up off a legendary. 
---
It claimed a hundred-something damage but when I shot things, even point blank, it did like a quarter of that damage. Whatupwitdat?
---
Same with gauss rifles, the time I tried one it did hardly a fraction of the claimed damage.
---
Buy it from the free states vender bot in white springs.  There is also a lvl 45 static spawn on the roof of a massage palor on the north side of berkely springs.
---
Dude, this game stutters enough when Im mashing X when crafting. Safe to say you would just disconnect upon hitting a craft all button or kill the server.
---
Unless it's a bayonet for black powder rifles. Then you have to scrap the mod to learn it. Only one that works like that as far as I know.
---
Its been datamined, although I can‚Äôt find the thread.  A lot of extra damage effects, either while hitting, while being hit, while blocking, etc.  Cryo, flame, things like that.  The most exciting one is a flat +20% damage boost, which outperforms most primary effects.
---
Just drop gifts. Wrapping is in the factions vendors in whitesprings not the normal whiyesprings bots tho.
---
Yep! Sometimes they don‚Äôt seem to understand I‚Äôm trying to give them things tho lol
---
Junkies Vanguard build, 100%. I use it with auto rifles, and do great damage even though some of my addictions are messed up. Make sure you choose the right addictions for your build though!
---
Interesting lol
---
I‚Äôm getting so many legendaries I‚Äôve started dropping off loads of cheap 1* stuff in front of scrip machines.
---
You can just make handmade versions of the gifts you can claim off the scorched cant put things in them the loot is exactly the same as the loot you get off the event, I know it would be good to be able to gift ppl things of your choice this is still pretty cool tho them caps that nobody values are now worth something and you've got a good chance of getting some of them plans that seemed impossible to get
---
That is insane.
---
It's all part of the journey you just have to adapt and strategize I started in october and I Solo erythang I'm lvl 53 now but I had to play this game different that fo3 or fnv I never used melee at all then I got All Rise and omg it was a game changer my build isnt dedicated to one thing but a combination of sniper, heavy, commando and a smidge of melee I'm gearing more towards heavy gunner now that I'm capable of crafting .50 cal in qty. but I would've never been so spread out in 3. In 3 it was power armor and a mini gun or chinese assault rifle all day. Now in NV I did incorporate the 45-70 because I'm a fan irl, the anti-material rifle, and any heavy gun that wasn't flame related.
---
I just drop off care packages of 1* stuff in front of the Purveyor‚Äôs scrip machine.
---
Friend keys were passed out during beta for friends' of purchasers to play with them, to encourage extra sales
---
Hmm I hope that's not going to be the final version. The elemental effects are cool but if you put them against a flat damage increase there will be no competition.
---
You won't lose much because the NPCs being added. They will just be another mob in the wasteland, except some will be friendly while others want to kill you. You probably won't see them at most locations in the game.
---
Radium rifles are the hardest to unlock mods in the game. Suggest you find someone on the trading subs and pay them to do it. Worth every cap.
---
I wasn‚Äôt really getting frustrated, just confused. I found one though
---
Running from cranberry glade to forward station delta this morning I ran into three groups of them.... one group was in the middle of nowhere.
---
I have a instigating which is quite good as it doubles damage, best used at close range
---
How does it work the thing you are suggesting me?
---
Can anyone walk me through this junkie build?
---
It's all relative though. I get more enjoyment out of playing the game then I do aggravation from the bugs. I would love if 76 was a well oiled machine, but I am also not going to pretend it is the dumpster fire that the circle jerk makes it out to be. I paid 20 dollars for it and have gotten 150 hours of game out of it, I'm not complaining.
---
I think they saw old vaults as places to plunder, I don't remember what the scribe said in FO3, but they had files on the different vaults as possible sources of tech
---
Somehow I got 2 kills using the automatic laser pistol.
---
Pistols are legitimately a lot of fun.  My main was built for Bloodied melee and heavy weapons, but gravitated into pistols due to their reasonable damage output, range, and overall efficiency.  My alt was built for pistols from the start.
---
Inspiring.
---
Everybody else has to expend ammunition and or materials, if others started doing the same the events will fail.  What if an event you are in doesn‚Äôt succeed, but just barely (how many times have we seen that happen on SBQ events), maybe it would have been completed if you had contributed.  So not only do you not get the goodies, neither do the others.
---
Sorry, I just think we all need to pull together, there will always be those that are selfish and take away from the game for others.  I too have lost stuff that way, as probably have a lot of others.  But I will continue to try to be an upstanding vault dweller.
---
Muhammad Avdol?
---
I would love the protectron faction themed vendor, instead of each vending machine having a 30 slot limit you just use the vendor bot for everything. They already have them in game and would fit the theme of robots. When wastelanders comes sure but something about hearing a raider bot say ‚Äúfive finger discounts will be repaid with said fingers‚Äù makes me happy.
---
Hmm...out of the frying pan and into the fire! I like it.
---
You find someone who can craft the mods, you agree on the price, you give them the rifle, they mod it the way you want it, they sell it back to you for the agreed price.
---
Put that arch out of your mind.  Even with the plans, you still need a fair amount of flux which isnt something you can easily farm without dropping a nuke.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
&gt; If you can think of yourself as a legit pvp‚Äôer after hunkering down that‚Äôs up to you. 
---
I don't see how getting killed minutes into the match without killing a single other player makes you a 'legitimate pvper."  Like I said, I actually killed another player. The guy criticizing me for 'camping' and bragging about being a hunter didn't kill  a single one. I've made that argument several times and the only response people can come up with is to downvote it, rather than explain why I'm wrong.
---
5 named NPCs mentioned so far, but I hadn't heard of any factions beyond the raiders and settlers.
---
Though there will be dialogue trees, companions and romancable characters according to the big piece that PCGamer did on it.
---
Well it was fun while it lasted.. Back in the Stash box Mr Crossbow...
---
Go to the fissure sites. 80-85% of the time there‚Äôs a legendary scorched.
---
Double barrel is so underpowered. That thing should be blasting through shit and it barley dings metal.
---
I don't think I agree. 
---
It forces those who over farm to potentially sell to vendor bots and makes legendaries much more available, like when the game was launched and you could find legendary weapons and armour for reasonable prices everywhere, reducing the RNG frustrations that can be experienced.
---
Share the wealth.  Make the holiday season a giving and festive occasion.
---
Sadly no. But it does have bone nubs too, but also it still jangles...it should make squishing noises.
---
It would sort of be like them hating the Visigoths; Vault-Tec doesn't really exist post war. (No, we do not talk about Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel)
---
Monthly.
---
Is this IRL, or an in-game item?
---
Not anymore, SH power armor makes them a beast in PvP and PvE.
---
Level 20-something ... oh well, maybe I‚Äôll get lucky with player vendors, otherwise guess I‚Äôll wait lol
---
I can‚Äôt believe I read that whole thing
---
Yep, it's the same people that keep killing me and I need to ask them what kind of chairs they got so I can git gud. LOL
---
Ah ... well perhaps I‚Äôll get lucky, otherwise, guess I‚Äôll limp along with my RadAway lol
---
I think you have to travel to the area of the Mire that triggers it. Also, some time between events (seems like more than a day).
---
Good idea!
---
Yep, that's some grade-A seal clubbing, right there.
---
At least above legendaries, yea! And auto body looting companions with wastelanders.
---
A locked vault supposed to hold unimaginable treasure, hidden in a land full of monsters, lunatics, and guns? Where have I heard this before...?
---
Is this new to you guys? It‚Äôs been happening for months.
---
If no one helps you, i may have one for you.
---
In3briatedPanda1 is my PSN.  Im on X1 now so i wont need it.  I think its a level 50 though and its not a legendary, just a standard.
---
I dunno dude my bloodied shotgunner deals out 1K + damage ü§î
---
I've fwlt that way for a while, got my perk cards specced into it and it still felt underwhelming compared to other weapons.
---
Adding elemental damage and elemental type enemies would be a pretty cool addition to 76
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure what triggers it, because the weight reduction part still works. I tested this a few times but haven‚Äôt found an exact cause. Sometimes it would still fast-reload after I quit the game and restart. I don‚Äôt know if it has anything to do with Speed Demon, that‚Äôs one thing i haven‚Äôt tested yet, since I‚Äôll need to remove a bunch of mutations first üò´
---
No. The subscription is tied to the Bethesda account, not the Xbox Live sub.
---
I‚Äôll try that, so you just switch to a different weapon when you leave the server?
---
Yes. This. Please.
---
Does anyone have a list of Halloween stuff?
---
Yes, But if you forgot just swap weapons when you do load in. You load in with a pump action. Reload is slow. Switch to a melee or somthing else and switch back. Issue solved for the most part
---
OMG this is a really good idea!
---
Definitely a better reward than the randomized ammo rewards!
---
I like this idea!
---
BINGO!!!
---
The game would absolutely SUCK for starting out players with removals of these limits.  Sure the High Levels would find thrills and giggles at the expense of trashing the whole game.
---
Better for players to just start over and build a new character and remind themselves that those limits actually help the game perpetuate itself for, hopefully, a long run.
---
If you're not a bloodied build they're a lot nicer than RadAway, what with the mutation suppression and lowered disease resist. Heck even as a bloodied I like using mine to fine tune my rads. Don't always have brahmin milk on hand.
---
That being said, it's a drop from an end game event and extremely costly to build (lots of flux) and costly to power (30 energy). Keep it as a long term goal, but at level 20 it's going to be extremely difficult to acquire and run - resources that would be much better spent on other aspects of your character.
---
Yeah, I only use the combat explosive shotgun. It's the best for me, especially with all the shotgun perks. I tried the double barrel and pump and they seemed really weak so I told them.
---
I have been playing high since like day 1 lol... It makes things more interesting for sure. 
---
Now imagine mushrooms + 76. That would be insane.
---
Some real squares for sure..
---
Yes. It drives me nuts
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre trying to tell us that you‚Äôre a little cunt.
---
Yeah, they were the end-all and be-all when the game first launched, but then they took a massive beating from the nerf hammer. Personally, I'd have left their damage the same and crippled their range. You know, like *actual shotguns.*
---
If rads are a concern hunt for legendary armour with rad resistance, with the scorched event on right now players vendors should be full of low level armours.
---
AGREED.  THIS EVENT IS AWESOME. Why? You just go out and hunt legendary scorched and get decent rewards. no glitchy timed events or need to depend on others to get rewards.  No OP boss and rewards are plentiful (if low level) and really provides something.  All in all they nailed it.  Now please fix everything you broke making this happen.  Oh and shotguns need to be fixed they suck now.
---
Radaway doesn‚Äôt suppress mutations, it gets rid of them if you don‚Äôt have Starched Genes.
---
I have a 2-star Bloodied Combat Shotgun that works really well for when I‚Äôm mobbed by ghouls. Depending my my health damage is usually around 430-440 although I can get it to break 500.
---
But it‚Äôs a secondary to my lever-action. 
---
I will say that it‚Äôs fantastic for finishing off scorched beasts once they land. It chews through them and prevents them from taking off again.
---
I do 3x as much damage as a vampire build and
---
2x as much as a junkies build.
---
In all fairness I contribute the same with half the ammo. Considering that all of my led and steel gets stolen if I die...... theoretically I am contributing the same as others if I only use 1/3rd if the ammo and instead play defensively to protect my loot.
---
I'm just not sure why I am doing 2.5x as much damage on average and technically am wasting more ammo because of the loss of mats for crafting ammo upon death. I can easily just dump one clip into the queen and then take a defensive position and watch for legendaries for the rest of the event....it sure doesn't seem like anyone appreciates me wasting my ammo.
---
All m0d Con I'll be on most of Sunday
---
Hmmmmmmm....
---
Appreciate it
---
cool idea, but honestly right now I would prefer them fixing bugs.
---
tl;dr,  I am a dick.
---
They‚Äôre common, they just don‚Äôt drop once you know them, same with prime receivers. Ultracite armour is different, it continues dropping.
---
I‚Äôll try that. I‚Äôve tried swapping weapons many times, didn‚Äôt help unless I do the unequip/reequip
---
Okay all good. Try what I said before.
---
Junkies will get addicted to everything that does effect their damage. That's about it really, your tse would be replaced with a junkies weapon and same with all other weapons. 
---
I'm just a melee/rifleman build with no junkies can do fine though. It really depends on if you want to be OP and have to grind new weapons.
---
I can make you one for free or give you the plans to build your own.  Name on ps4 is Clownskull1234 I'll be on after work around 4 eastern time.
---
This would make finding bodies  in a badly placed nuke area so much better
---
Its really the same with pistols too. Shotguns and pistols both need to be brought up to par with heavies and rifles. Not necessarily through damage buffs, but maybe pistols get dual wield. Shotguns I guess need more armor penetration. I think the way the damage is applied is based on each pellet. So 100 damage divided by 10 pellets, and all of a sudden the shotgun cant pass the minimum damage threshold depending on the enemies DR. While we are at it, lets add dual wield to the one handed weapons too. Or sword and shield. 
---
Might be too op with fist weapons though. Can you imagine dual wielding Death claw gauntlets!?!
---
A. Heavy Gunners carry the raid, not you, wimp.
---
B. Materials and ammo is cheap and easy
---
C. Very few people in F76 steal
---
I think you just plain suck at video games üòï
---
There is a lot of strange things with this game.
---
IRL
---
That could be.
---
Get the plans and make and break a bunch. You‚Äôll quickly learn lots of mods to make them better, and they aren‚Äôt expensive on materials to make.
---
But just imagine a Vanguard Sentinel Handmade
---
I dont understand the question. Are you asking when the actual game mode of nuclear winter, which offers a battle royal experience, will be removed from the game? Because we have no evidence whatsoever that it ever will.
---
Drunk and high are waaaaayy different. And I‚Äôve had a great time running around with drunk people.
---
Well there are still overseer's that exist which is where my confusion is
---
Most of us aren‚Äôt children.
---
nuclearPANDA86 I'm usually down for some teaming up.
---
Yes, but I won't be back on until tomorrow.
---
Whats your GT?
---
The next time I'm on find you and you can have it for free!
---
If you don't mind my asking, why are you bringing junk into an event like that?  I try not to have anything, certainly nothing I really don't want to lose, into an event where I could die.  It also limits my ability to pick up stuff during the event, I try to be as low of a carry weight as possible.  I was also under the impression that you didn't lose stuff when participating in events (before or after is another story), but I don't trust that to not bug out so I don't tempt fate.
---
Not necessarily.
---
Today, for me,each of  the ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù gift wraps I crafted with - which makes large presents...dropped 2 plans as well as a couple of scrap type items.   
---
Honey beast head was in one of them
---
 the mediums have dropped prime receiver plans And PA mod plans
---
I was on 3 servers last night and saw 1 total. Than got on another and was finding them no problem. It seems to be very random.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I wanted it, so I could have mutations and still clear my rads. Some kind soul found me being murdered by a bunch of high level super mutants and gave me some gifts which included plans for a fusion generator, so power is not a problem for me. But it sounds like I‚Äôll need some other high level mats, so I‚Äôll put it on the back burner for now. Thanks.
---
I used to play with a guy that did this. All he did was say the N Word and then stand around at my camp and talk on the Mic about his issues, he would go on some app and yell at people, we (our usual team) had to block him. Sad really. He was Ok not drinking but unbearable on Grandpa's old cough medicine.
---
I'm saving half my handmade gifts from now on and all of the gifts I get as drops the last week before Christmas. Hoping the Christmas trees from last year come back on Tuesday for a festive opening atmosphere.
---
Dual Yield is my wish.  
---
Can you imagine pairing an Instigating with an Executioners ... BAM BAM
---
OR  a Berserkers with a Vampire  BAM BAM BAM
---
OR  just Two AAEs  ..... Yeah Baby.  Let's have at 'er.
---
 I really wish Bethesda had made all legendary gear untradable.   They do it for certain items you can earn legitimately, (like the strangler heart armor).  The rampant Duping of legendary gear is something the game never really recovered from IMO. Keep em or scrip em should be the only options, but it's too late for that now probably because it seems we have an entire economy based on the trade of legendary gear.  I actually wish the game had not contained any legendary gear at all.
---
They were nerfed along with the Handgun
---
I still don't get Borderlands humor. Fun game, though.
---
Lvl50 super sledge with "heating coil" mod
---
Yeah
---
Some new players don't understand. First I get frustrated but then I remind myself the time when I was lv2 straight out of the vault and a scary PA guy lvl 200something starded crouching and shooting the ground. I got so scared I ran away. Though he's some kind of a gangster saying: dance mothe%#¬£&amp;_r. !!
---
You need to craft/scrap literally hundreds to unlock everything. Actually maybe not everything.
---
Yeah its super hard to learn more, you can buy the plan from the guy at harpers ferry I think, but seriously i would make like 15 of them in one sitting and if im lucky learn 1 or 2 mods. I must have scrapped like 200 or so by now and im only just over half of the mods learned.
---
nice!
---
I‚Äôm only lvl 15:(
---
Sorry I missed that in your post...
---
So basically as long as you had more fun than not, the developers don't really need to fix the problems with their product... Is that what your trying to imply?
---
Why? Is it affecting your life in a negative way? Other people smoking?
---
Two MAIN factions, the Raiders and Settlers (they'll likely have actual names). But there will be several smaller factions for other quests, such as the Cult of Mothman.
---
Or smelt all items with one click! And ect ect
---
Well my double barrel shotty is pretty solid tbh but its a legendary. Id love to get an explosive one tho
---
It‚Äôs all good. Do you have legendary stuff you don‚Äôt need? I still need plenty of caps for recipes etc.
---
If it‚Äôs just one server, it could be just your luck or RNG. However after yesterday‚Äôs patch I noticed an obvious decrease of holiday spawn. I hardly stay on one server for more than 15 min so they may indeed dropped the spawn rate.
---
There isnt much at the space station right now anyway. Find a peice of paper with a door code, open an airlock, get a spacesuit IF it wasnt already taken on that server.
---
I feel major overhauls like that will only happen in places with nothing going on right now.
---
I wish they would‚Äôve done a Krampus themed event or brought back Graham for a holiday themed meat week event.
---
I immediately sell all my legendary stuff I don't want at the depots.
---
I have been thinking about what to do with all my known plans I've collected - they take up .25 weight in inventory
---
Was just about ton ask the same thing
---
2 hour play and not one holiday scorched
---
In fact, not even much acorched but plenty of ghouls üòí
---
What level gat plasma are you looking for? I have a few but none at level 35/40
---
Well if you want to free space just lmk I‚Äôll gladly take anythingüòÇ
---
Oh, and yes, if i have Super Duper equipped,  you can handle randomization of success.
---
I got 2 or 3, seems like it's a clean 33-33-33% split for me so far. I got a large gift off a level 6 scorched at that bolton greens event. Seems completely random. My best drops have come from medium gifts too
---
Sounds like a bunch of die hard pvp players are starting a murder clan to me.  ;)
---
Or a snow machine !
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been emote spamming the gift and the cmere emote to try to make it seem nicer lol
---
There is an older post from a build scientist here that has every detail you would ever need. It's called pa heavy bloodied build I believe. I don't use pa unless it's a sbq. I can solo her now using this person's build. It's sick if you have the right weapon.
---
I went through the outside of Morgantown airport today and there was one just walking around out back and then when I triggered collision course three out of the five waves of scorched had Santas.
---
Baseball bats. I got a bloodied/faster swing speed/power attack damage baseball bat and it‚Äôs silly strong.
---
The extreme members of the brotherhood likely see vaults as an attempt to hide advanced technology.
---
Other members likely don't care.
---
Yeah yo and I got scrip from the large handmade presents as well.
---
They rolled back the drwr fix, so you armor and weapons should be back to normal.
---
I use mine a The Whitespring every visit. Vampire's to cripple, and Bloodied to execute. If you get the groups in the clubhouse to follow you on the tennis court it's a lot of fun.
---
I'm on Xbox as well but I don't know how all that works to meet up and trade - in game. What I recently did this morning I'm not playing this afternoon was to drop a bunch as a test at white springs. I'm not going to sell 'em as a vendor at my camp
---
This is correct. Bos hoard technology and use vault dwellers to help acquire it when necessary. They will kill anyone including vault dwellers when they get in the way. 
---
Lyons pride tried to focus on charity and was cut off from the rest of the bos for it. 
---
76 vault dwellers fraudulently joined the bos through hacking and false identity. Especially having no military experience. Also sharing technology and using mwd‚Äôs. 76 dwellers should be considered terrorist infiltrators.
---
I do it for the XP.
---
It‚Äôs available until December 17. If you read the [patch updates](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3kVcfMX9lDS3xImrNmpMnX/atomic-shop-update-16-items-and-sales-december-10) , it lists the new items and when they leave! So you should be able to get it :)
---
Because it's never been a real ban wave of any real bite. Even during the cross platform dupe days guys were not getting banned with 50 plus be weapons of each type in the inventory. I had an old friend who bought tons of stuff on his main to resell and never had an issue. I thought he was nuts but he ended up being the wiser I guess  Saw sellers on eBay with 200 plus sales of different weapons during that time.
---
I am not trying to imply anything. I paid 20 dollars for a product, got more enjoyment out of that product then I did aggravation, therefore that product was worth my money.
---
Double barrels and combats still do something. Sometimes i oneshot others it takes a flippin clip. Lol just depends on ur build i guess :) and how many perks u want into it
---
I ran into a naked super mutant in a cabin.
---
They look so peaceful and somber when not screaming about murder.
---
So basically we get on at the same time and add eachother as Xbox friends
---
This.  If you‚Äôre a shotgun build basically you‚Äôre only viable job is to cripple ghouls in WS or in a nuke zone.   It‚Äôs fun as hell but it‚Äôs still just one trick.
---
This has been asked for a year, and CMs been avoiding these posts like smallpox.
---
Have you turned on the damage numbers to confirm your actually doing less damage with your handmade?
---
I am mute....
---
:(
---
I think you had a bad day in the Wasteland.
---
Nah, I couldn't take your caps. 
---
Happy to let you have any excess I've got, no charge.
---
Big Bend Tunnel has been best for me.  A Legendary at each end, two in the tunnel even if you don't go sides.  2 2-star each end, one each 1- and 3- star kin the tunnel.  Unscientific survey, of course.
---
Sorry friend, PS4.
---
I paid 60, got almost 400 hrs of more enjoyment than anger and don't feel robbed either. 
---
I don't know what any of this has to do with my original comment though...
---
Finally found a used for the 450,000 caps I've amasses across my 3 xbl accounts and mules. 65k in and I've only still needing sb and sbq mounts I think. Are they confirmed available?
---
Yeah same. I take most everthing I find.
---
It's a real problem üòÇ.
---
Of course. I always have numbers on.
---
Because even with an SSD load times in this game can reach upwards of 1 minute. It can take nearly 3 minutes to fast travel to your base and then again to the event.
---
I used to go to my stash first to get weapons dedicated for the queen fight but nowadays with all of the duped gear floating around and players exploiting double Unyielding glitches you're lucky if the scorched Earth event even lasts 3 minutes, so I go straight to the event get my licks in and then take a defensive position to protect my loot.
---
A big problem with nuke zones for bloodied builds right now is the invisible line of radiation zones. One second you're good and then next thing you know you're taking max radiation damage. After the event you go to loot the queen and don't realize that she is in the Nuke zone......this is when vampire build power armor guy seizes on the opportunity to steal your loot after you just carried his ass in the event.
---
Beth must have a bad day everyday then
---
You're right - it's RadX that suppresses them.
---
And the shower will clear mutations too without starched genes. I think anything that removes rads can.
---
It‚Äôs been a minute but I recall the paper damage being 500ish with a bloodied explosive combat shotgun and the proper perks. When it works properly sure, it shreds but I‚Äôd definitely see a wall of 1s and 2s when a shot should have killed way too often. 
---
People here seemed to think it had something to do with the explosive effect triggering the same damage bug that occurs with a tesla. I found it frustrating enough to retire that character which says a lot - I‚Äôm usually not easily deterred by bugs.
---
From what I've seen here and on the official boards, YES they are dropping from Santatron at a very low drop rate. I've seen 1% thrown around and that may be correct. 
---
Hate all you want but I think that the rate is fine as it is. Considering you don't have to do anything yourself for them but build/toggle your bot on. Plus since they work in workshops as well as camps I don't think the drop rate should be increased. Players COULD hypothetically run 20+ of the bots as it is already. IMO this is probably why the drop rate is as low as it is.
---
I prefer to think of 76-BoS-ers as extreme Cosplayers with working Power Armor and Weaponry.
---
Works for me. Consistant 1 shots and can melt anything. Not sure if only some experiance this but others talk about bugs with shotguns I never heard tell of.
---
Yeah they did. Which is why I bothered to post. I'm not hitting for the numbers I did just last week. Tried screwing around with every perk. Only the handmade. My 10mm SMG, plasma, laser, all seem fine.
---
Bethesda: The community has been asking for corpse marking for sometime. We are now adding the utility for active FO1st members.
---
Exact reason that pushed me over the edge to finally stop playing the game. I made a shotgun build for my level 150 character to take advantage of my explosive nocturnal combat shotgun.....then they nerf the hell out of it. No point in playing now.
---
Don't worry. I will kill any 3* legendaries that pop up while you are shooting the queen so you don't have to waste your precious mats for ammo on them. Help yourself to my lunch bag if I die.
---
If you're lucky I will use my bloodied 50% limb damage Fixer to at least put her on the ground for you so you don't waste all of your ammo spinning in circles shooting at the clouds
---
They been running around with the Mole Miners during events for quite some time now. Not sure if they're pets or not, but those are some hardcore dudes to weaponize angry animals.
---
I find them in lvl 3 safes pretty often.
---
Ok.
---
*Rolls around in 200 pieces of coal*
---
I appreciate they finally added target dummies to test weapon damage against
---
And let us convert our unwanted ammo to scrip to get the ammo from those same machines
---
Odd, don't know what to say if your perks and effects are all in order. Especially since the numbers are lower. Hopefully it's not a stealth nerf or something wild lol. I'll be checking my guns today too
---
Still trying to figure out how to display my banjo.
---
Still trying to sell it for 5 caps, too.
---
I usually find about 3 inside the airport
---
Shotgun nerf was a big reason I quit
---
No we‚Äôre just here to in force the law
---
I can make you one, any level. I also have about 30 legendary ones for sale in my vendor (all max level)
---
That's why I think it has more to do with the armor piercing effects. The Pip Boy numbers look correct.
---
edit; or maybe they increased the armor of certain mobs
---
How do you know you got it? Is there a notification?
---
Always. My name ain‚Äôt Special_K_Friend for nothing ü§òüèª
---
Death Stranding can be fun too.
---
I thought of early bf4 .they wanted to save costs. used a bottom-level 30hz server. I always thought it was just a console. It turned out that the PC has also recently been used.
---
&gt;I know this has probably been asked a million times before
---
Did you bother searching for any of those previous questions?
---
I thought people were saying with the new power armor that does acid damage works well with shotguns because the acid damage is applied to each bullet?
---
B) obviously mats are worth something or people wouldn't steal them.
---
C) if there are 10 people at an event and 1 person steals your junk that means at the very least 10% of players in Fallout 76 steal.
---
Hopefully you're better at video games than you are at math.
---
Nah it‚Äôs okay, just made thirty after a little not of farming and i have an two shot explosive one üòÄüòÄ
---
Have you tried teaming up in the main menu then starting the private world, as far as im aware thats how its supposed to work
---
The arch clears mutations, you're really best off just using starched genes.
---
You need to go to fissure prime or glassed cavern.
---
In addition to legendary scorchbeasts lurking there have been multiple legendary scorched in those areas.  Made two runs and accumulated too much stuff lol.
---
At the bottom of the screen it shows which button for team or all friends. It‚Äôs square on PA4. Push that to toggle between the two
---
Pretty random. Some places have 1 or 2 per spawn but then you try later and nothing. Most I saw was 3 right next to each other in Morgantown airport. Then sometimes none.
---
It's entirely possible. Tons of bugs in this game that cripple some and leave others untouched....
---
Cool!
---
The All Rise treated me well at lower levels. Still pretty decent.
---
Are you serious? That is unbelievably kind of you. My GT is tuck n tape. I am happy to repay you if I have something that you need. Thanks again!
---
Actually i was referring to this sub. I remember when the premium membership was announced that everyone in this sub Reddit was really upset with it, but now there's post like this where a person is gloating above everyone else that didn't give into the membership. Its just a bit weird to not see this post getting down voted into oblivion.
---
And i know that this kind of stuff happens in the world, i just happen to live in a not so remote area and i just don't see it that often.
---
Side question, does anyone know if ghoul slayers works on "glowing ones"?
---
Ive heard people are but surprising im not even did 3 or 4 sbq events as well but passed 72 hrs nothing..
---
Melee shotgun is OP. The weakness of melee is flying mobs. Enforcer makes my melee tank a no fly zone. Fast bastards get slowed too
---
Sploosh!
---
You‚Äôre basically buying a lottery scratch off. Buy the paper, craft gift at tinker bench (use Chemist for double), then just open the present in your Aid tab, and see what luck gives you. You could give these to others, but it‚Äôll be random when they open it just like you. I would avoid buying small wrap and stick with medium and large.
---
On weeeeed man!
---
Unfortunately Bethesda is a little rough around the edges when it comes to balancing. But hey, tomorrow they might nerf everything else and your noctural shotgun might become the new meta!
---
Those people lied to you.  Demolition expert absolutely boosts the damage of those.  For a better AOE experience, ask your doctor if grenadier rank 2 is right for you.
---
Redeemable ammo vouchers would be nice. Set it up like at Responder camps n such. Dont even need to be super rewarded like 35 5.56, 100 5mm, 40 10mm, 3 missile, 50 energy pack, 1 fusion core, 1 plasma core, etc etc. If you really wanna get technical you could set up responders to give weaker ammo (10mm, .32) while an Enclave ammo voucher would give ultracite or heavier rounds (5.56, 5mm). Raiders give you explosives (missiles, 40mm). Brotherhood gives you energy (energy packs, fusion cores). Not a bad idea OP.
---
This ^^
---
Yeah it‚Äôs odd it‚Äôs never been this frequent for me to want to bitch about it but lately it has been crazy. My first SBQ in quite some time too.
---
they are weak because the entire sub complained that they were too op so they got nerfed to the ground
---
You cannot increase the level no.
---
I'll try that, and keep you posted, thanks for the reply!üòÄ
---
People who sell in game weapons on EBay are pretty slimy IMO.
---
It does, but the increase is very small. I‚Äôd only really recommend it if you are also using grenades or a grenade launcher.
---
As I explained in the post, I already know how to do that part, but thanks for the reply!
---
You've learned everything you can.For now we can only stare at the door of Vault 79 in wonder at what's inside.Whatever it is, the government went through a lot to keep it a secret. I'm imagining some sort of Indiana Jones warehouse type thing, full of government secrets, gold and more.&gt;!Somethings to note....!&lt;
---
* &gt;!The number for gold on the periodic table is 79!&lt;
---
* &gt;!The trucks travelling through the weigh station were severely overweight.!&lt;
---
* &gt;!Multiple references to gold have been mentioned in promotional material!&lt;
---
* &gt;!The Eden Theory, Appalachia was to be the Enclaves New Eden. Each vault holding an essential building block for rebuilding America.!&lt;
---
* &gt;!The secret service was created to "safeguard the financial and critical infrastructure of the United States ", we know from datamines that there is a new power armor called the "secret service" set.!&lt;
---
* &gt;!Conclusion: Vault 79 is a massive Gold vault, likely the US government moved all the countries gold there in preparation for!&lt; &gt;!the bombs to fall. One driver stole some gold and was caught, the US government covered it up. The secret service are still alive and well defending the interior.!&lt;
---
Well, shit.
---
Thanks for answering!
---
Grahm also carries the plan if you happen to see him, but Watoga or Whitesprings is probably more reliable. IIRC should be around 1800-1900 caps depending on charisma (before hard bargain etc).
---
Or engaged with enemies, all of a sudden.
---
Seems like she was one of the truck drivers delivering to the site and decided to try steal some of whatever they were transporting. The whole casino shootout simply being a coverup for what really happened, since most of the story is simply over the top and far fetched.
---
While it dose increase the dmg on say a tse lever. It dose not effect explosive energy weapons, such as a tse laser rifle
---
Just curious,  PS4 or PS4 Pro? I'm on Pro.
---
I prefer to drink my Nukashine while naked.
---
I've wanted them to implement a way to sell camp blueprints for awhile. That way builders can take a core role in the game and sell or give away the neat creations they make to other players/characters, who then just need to farm the required resources.
---
But in order to do that they'd have to improve the blueprint system because it's just plain awful-- it should be as simple as click **one** button and it blueprints your entire camp, but it's nowhere near that.  So I don't think they'll make changes like this any time soon. Bigger fish to fry kind of thing.
---
Modders though, they could probably create this function in a matter of days.
---
Lol that happend to me frequently in the beta. But with jetpacks.
---
I wanna know how long can i earn the nuclear winter rewards
---
are these good rifles? the radium ones?

Just dont like playing games in movie mode. Game mode is best also for latency but far too bright.
---
This is the build I use for my bloodied heavy gunner.  Mutations are on there too, although I would skip the talons mutation (I use melee too).  For gear, I use 1 ea mutant slayers. Zealots, ghoul slayer, troubleshooter and exterminator, all with the sentinel legendary perk as well, which means no matter what I‚Äôm fighting (except animals, but I haven‚Äôt encountered any death claw hordes lol) I get a 90% damage reduction 75% of the time as long as I‚Äôm standing still.  I‚Äôve found this works best for me for all around protection.  You can also go with a full set of unyielding or bolstering if those are more your style.  
---
Disclaimer: this is a non PA build.

I have always been a combat shotgun gal.
---
Rifle hits from long range, then run in, pellets a flying. 
---
I get more damage from my ski sword than I do my shotgun. And I still have my rifle...
---
I remember when my shotgun was a one-two shot killing God. After level 50? Yeah... the sucker does very min damage, even at close range. 
---
Dear Bethesda: Stop fucking with our shotguns 
---
PS: please make ammo sellable to vendors. Isn't worth the space in my shop/stash to place ammo at 0 caps just to get rid of it/help players out. Either that, or make the damn things scrapable
---
Got all 3 types. Didnt count today, but yesterday 7 large, 15 normal &amp; 32 small. Got plasma grenade plans and icecile lights today though.
---
You: my finger hurts...
---
Bethesda: what was that?
---
You: I said my finger hurts, from all the button pushing
---
Bethesda: well now your back is gonna hurt, because you just pulled landscaping duty
---
Jet hasn't been invented yet in the lore I think. That's why it's out.
---
Tbh, I wish there was a way to exchange stars between legendary. And make it grindy if it happens.
---
Pistols need to be brought up to the same strength they have in fallout 4. You could play the entire game with a 10mm
---
Ha same. I considered holding off til after the event but said screw it, set them at higher prices and they‚Äôre selling. Recycle to buy more gifts.
---
Not in battle royale
---
You've been selected by Beth! It's your entry token to the vault in 2076 when it all goes ass over elbow. :p
---
I like this
---
Yeah they had one hell of an Xmas bash.
---
I have a 3 star level 50 FSS rocket sledge that puts the all rise to shame. I will give it to you if you‚Äôre interested. Gamertag Lone Dovah I will be on this evening around 7pm
---
I made one alt as shotgunner, but havnt played it much 50+ because of this reason. They really killed it with the nerf.
---
Honestly I think what plan you get isn‚Äôt based on what size gift. For example, same chance for each for a plan. Buttttt....small has a chance of no plan at all. So you might get a plan and it be a rare one, or get no plan. At least that‚Äôs the case with dropped small gifts. Idk if that changes when you craft them. Also have noticed large gifts giving sometimes 2 plans as well as lots of caps (got back 1000 once) and scrip. I don‚Äôt think medium or small gives chance of any scrip either.
---
Thank you for the offer! I will be on at 7üëç what does the FFS stand for?
---
What‚Äôs your gamertag I will message you
---
GSG062
---
Ok
---
I‚Äôve lost so much loot to not being able to find the body after a big battle.   I downed a SB and it went flying behind me, but I was too busy with crowd control to see where.   Searched but never found it.   (Later it down down next to me)
---
I really liked games like Diablo, with the colored beacon of light beaming like a laser into the sky showing a Legendary drop.
---
But the idea of fireflies is the best idea to keep it immersive in 76.
---
Or just give us the ammo for the weapon we have equipped
---
Just craft it yourself. When I used my .50 cal I crafted 15k each time. Just run lucky hole mine, have a decent amount of steel from scrapping weapons and find your source for acid.
---
Nope, try a powercycle reset. Hold down the power button until it fully turns off
---
You can share the game amongst accounts. I have a buddy with 20+ accounts, for simplified high volume trading, each with five characters all linked to his same Xbox live gold so he doesn‚Äôt have to keep buying the game
---
I think Junkies is.  Is there a particular reason you want to sometimes play full health?  I sometimes bump my HP and use a primed Zealots FFR for SQB fights when I don't want to pay much attention to the mobs. Considering some  troubleshooters kit for Encryptid so I can take pylons.
---
Also got this feeling and pretty much suspected it to be stealth nerfed. It‚Äôs still good tho, get more legendaries then I can scrip on all characters. lol
---
It‚Äôs still RNG. Should is not a thing. I SHOULD have gotten a god roll weapon by now but I haven‚Äôt in over 1000 hours
---
Probably because the game is like 10$ so losing your account wouldn't really be all that big of a problem if they can just make whatever legendary items they want and buy the game again for 10$ if they were to get banned.
---
Have a collection of bloodied. W the right perks and mods they're viable. Recently picked up an instigating non explosive combat sg. Very effective
---
You have to undo it backwards: the floors touching the top have to be removed or stored before you can remove the stairs. It's not a "glitch", it's part of the camp logic rules in the game. They're there to prevent floating structures and other things.
---
Make the part of your camp you DO want into a plan, then ‚Äúmove‚Äù your camp and scrap everything, and place the plan where your existing campi is. 
---
Not ideal, but works.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Well Rested +5% XP just by sleeping.
---
Yea I guess it's different for us console guys because the can ban our psn/xblive
---
Mostly for raids. When I‚Äôm in power armour I very rarely die, but when out of it I‚Äôm very frail. I‚Äôm a stealth build and I‚Äôm rarely detected, but sometimes it happens and if I get swarmed I often go down. It‚Äôs also be nice to have a little variability.
---
Taking pylons is another good point. I can‚Äôt really do it at the moment unless I sit in a corner spamming stims in my inventory to avoid the animations, unless I get in PA.
---
Huh really? I didnt know about that. They screwed up the music in the radio pretty badly that raped the lore lol
---
the game's lowkey already been wrecked, but its not because of the players.
---
Tried that, doesn't work. I literally can't remove any part of the structure, including the upper floors at the very top. There is no way that's intentional.
---
Reason they place you back on same server is to try and prevent server hopping. Personally I want them to remove the system they have to try and prevent server hopping as it only adds extra steps to do it.
---
I love how you're getting downvoted but you're actually right LMAO... If they tested their patches and such and had an actual testing server, things like this wouldn't happen. Its just super unprofessional, some games who let big exploits like this pass by them always immediately get on it to fix it, whereas they take weeks and sometimes fucking months to fix. It's not the players' fault although what they're doing is wrong but it's more of bethesda's fault for always letting shit like this happen in their game, this isn't the first time an exploit like this has come out and it surely won't be the last unless they pick their shit up.
---
Im considering doing that, it would just be extremely tedious. My camp is large and very detailed, so I'd have to make multiple blueprints. I have a lot of stuff in my vending machines that I'd have to re-enter, and a small part of my camp has an underwater pool, so I believe that would mess with replacing it.
---
One of my santa scorched last night was headless, naked, nob-interactable. Very annoying hunting down the jingle bells to find that(sexy) abomination.
---
I feel you. I had to do this, but it was actually beneficial in the long run
---
By "do it backwards" I mean you literally have to disassemble the entire floor leading to the stairs. Before it let's you remove a floor piece, it checks to see if that would make another floor piece "float". Yes it's frustrating, but it can be worked around.
---
My buddy's private server was terrible. Switched to mine, chock-fulla-fun .
---
Yep tried that and still didn‚Äôt work. Idk mate
---
Have you tried using the double barrel with damage enhancing mods? Its decent, but not good.
---
AFIK, it's an AI pathing issue. Bethesda decided when they designed the game that it was REALLY IMPORTANT that monsters can attack your camp and wreck your generators. That meant making sure there was no way you could build a second floor, put your generator up there, then delete the stairs to keep monsters from getting to it. So basically they crippled building, to support a mechanic that was never fun in the first place. Hands up everyone who thinks it's FUN to have your camp attacked by monsters all the time? : P
---
Even at half health the bloody/adrenal bonus is still higher than Junkies. Bloody is flexible like that. Everyone thinks you have to stay at 20%, but it performa well at 50% too.
---
I DID. The entire structure is just not deleting. I can't store it, or move it. It's just sitting there, taking up space. It isn't attached to any part of my actual camp. Its literally just two floors, and three stairs stacked on top of each other with two upper floors at the top. NONE of them will delete, no matter what.
---
Try building a floor piece connected to the stairs you want to remove, then build new sets of stairs (the metal ones with railings but not the ones with premade floor pieces and supports attached).
---
Connect those new stairs to another floor, or if not possible, bring them all the way to the ground to connect to a new foundation.
---
That has worked for me in the past.
---
I‚Äôm not a huge shotgun user but my fianc√© was and he said they ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù them recently, so I guess they suck now?
---
What platform are you on?
---
I went full in on shot guns, and it kills me that they don't work. 
---
Now I'm heavy weapons and it's ok, but I miss my quad shotty one star double barrel.
---
Ps4.
---
Plasma grenade, guitar sword, the raider/metal armor plans, the t45 and t51 PA plans. Maybe the SB and SBQ mounted heads.
---
Same. When I get home maybe I can take a look for you.
---
&gt; Plus Bethesda is a Triple A game dev and they've been making games for decades. They don't have the inexperience excuse either. Their shit should've been in order. 
---
This right fucking here, you took the words right out of my mouth. This isn't their first rodeo and they shouldn't be fucking up this bad, this is what makes me so upset about 76 because they obviously can make it a good game but it just seems like they're going in the direction of, "screw the game just give us money" now.
---
The most valuable will be the one(s) you wanted, but didn‚Äôt get :)
---
The ‚Äùbiggest‚Äù I‚Äôve gotten so far are about 5 different prime receiver plans and some PA mod plans.
---
But for my play style and preference, the crashed santa and the lights, plus the mounted heads that are not already in game are my goals :)
---
B
---
Probally
---
They're nice to have, they fit their own niche. It's like a Combat Rifle, but it spews a bit of radiation at enemies per shot. Now this can have negative benefits (ghouls heal from rads) as well as positives (Great if you're into PvP and have friends who are too). They also look and sound unique, but there are rifles that get the job done better.
---
SB and SBQ Heads and Mirelurk Queen Claw don't drop. They aren't part of the Event
---
My shottys are wildly inconsistent.
---
Some days they take down an enemy in one shot, other days it takes at least 5.
---
The phantom damage is incredibly annoying (health bar goes down, then jumps back up).
---
Im about to try that and see what happens
---
Well that would explain why haven't found them yet, thanks for point that out
---
Impeccable logic.
---
Me and my friends are currently farming them on a private server so yes you can still get them on a private server
---
You can do the same thing in the glassed cavern. Tons of ultracite in that cave which spawns tons of scorched!
---
I have a spare all rise
---
It's mentioned in a terminal in the Burrows. Not by name, but the terminal entry implies that people figured out how to huff manure before the war.
---
Also respawn legendary corpses if they end up at unreachable places. I just killed a legendary scorchbeast that fell into a fissure site.
---
They are good for taking out turrets. Guns in general are kinda shit
---
I mostly play a rifle build with low endurance.  In the past I used a melee weapon against low level enemies to conserve ammo but I realized I was always dealing with silly slap damage and disease.  Ive since put melee weapons away and carry a 10mm pistol or.38 as a secondary.  
---
Very few people are able to run both high strength and perception successfully.  I would pick one or the other.  The handmade is great with comando/vats/criticals, and as much adrenaline as you have room for.  
---
Might also consider the Adrenal mutation.  Even if you don‚Äôt run bloodied, the extra damage you deal at low health can get you out of a jam until you have time to heal up.
---
Post yours for sale at your camp. I get a ton of caps that way. Once you have been doing long enough, you know what ammo not to hold on to
---
It's the same concept as legendaries, you have to give them a few seconds to spawn. Will start off looking like a regular scorched and then lo glow green and turn into the santa scorched
---
The same thing applies in the Glassed Cavern, at least up to the very end. I did this last night.
---
Well, with all the perks enhancing damage and how the "Explosive" shotguns could one hit kill players at full health from far away, they were ridiculously f#@king OP.
---
On the other hand, I totally agree that up close, a shotgun should 1-hit obliterate monsters/NPCs that aren't "boss level" or higher.  
---
If you're up close, fighting a player, and you get a headshot, I'd say it should be no more than two hits like that to take out a player, no matter what perks/armor they have never more than three close headshots maxium to kill.  
---
The problems w/Fallout 76 seem to mostly lie in the exremes, with "min/max"er players who find every way to exploit combinations to fall outside of the normal range of damage/damage resistance.  
---
In any fight, there should always be at least a \*reasonable\* chance of either opponent succeeding - there should never be a case of one player being able to make the other player completely useless/simply crush them with no effort or luck involved.
---
Guess I should hang onto that Plasma Grenade plan for a bit.
---
How does radio music go against the lore?
---
Agreed
---
One hit kills from distance with "explosive" shotguns and Perk multipliers, were why I quit long ago.  I might try coming back - I just want them to not allow players to "min/max" their way to exetremely unbalanced OP offense OR defense.  Either opponent should always have at least a SLIGHT chance to win a fight and there should always at least some slight amount of luck involved.
---
I know it sounds tedious and complicated, but it's better than rebuilding everything üòÇ 
---
Sometimes you have to trick the system so you can remove pieces, I dunno why but (especially with the supported stairs) the game gets confused about the order of placement and the connected structures.
---
Another thing to think about, is if you build the supported stairs and then connect walls to the stairs (even if the top of the wall piece is touching the floor of the supported stairs) you won't be able to remove the stairs until you remove the walls. I don't know if that might resolve your issue
---
You should be able to expose yourself to forced evolutionary viruse and play the game as a super mutant low intelligence increased strength
---
Ok I appreciate it. I just wasn't having very good luck. I'll try again tonight
---
True true, I guess it all depends on what you consider valuable. I like to resell stuff that I‚Äôve already learned, so my question was more related to that. Like what are people really wanting and isn‚Äôt dropping much that could be valuable for resale. Santa Crash and Icicle Lights went for like 5000c total and I wasn‚Äôt even trying just threw a high price on them.
---
Bad luck.
---
I farm almost exclusively on private
---
Nothing pissed me off more about this game than being one-hit killed by a player that's far away (by an "Explosive" shotgun) - so far away, in fact, that I felt like I shouldn't even have to WORRY about their shotgun hurting me significantly.  
---
But no, BLAM, I'm dead.
---
Ok cool deal. Crossing my fingers for better luck next time
---
10mm jack-o lantern

Jack-o lantern for combat weapons(combat shotgun.combat rifle etc.

---
I read somewhere that you can do the same thing in the glassed cavern. Lemme find the posts as proof
---
What i was meaning is some songs dont belong in there. Like Old West virginia. The transister was not created in Fallout and that song wouldnt exist if it wasnt for the transister so it shouldnt be in the game
---
Didn't know they were giving free stuff for Fallout 76, thanks for heads up and looks like theres going to be two more drops too.
---
This has worked for me before.
---
My suggestion, build your own based on the obvious choices. Radicool has been mentioned, excellent for 1point perk card. Nerd rage is also a must, this goes with adrenal reaction mutation, and emergency protocols for your PA. Unyeilding at minimum 2 peices, maybe some bolstering, or lifesaving. Then you need to consider damage reduction. Serendipity is awesome. Depending on your build you can add alot to that. Blocker is great for melee damage, ricochet is  good for ranged damage. Dodgy eats your AP, but another option. Fireproof is sweet. Revenant adds crazy more damage, when another player, the mysterious stranger, or your lifesaving armor picks you up from your downed state.
---
I play bloody hvy gunner, in and out of my power armor alot. BE .50 and aa gatling for run-around, prime .50 and prime lmg for SBQ. With all your strength any bloody melee you like will save ammo on all the low level stuff.
---
So nothing further on the note at the post office?
---
It always seems to coincide with the time I actually feel motivated to decorate my camp, lol!
---
Well having the monitor specs was the important information your missing....
---
Your still missing resolution and basic information like which games your experiencing the problems with and what you have done to help
---
Didn‚Äôt Kevduit do this
---
There is definitely something funny going on with purifiers. I have five characters, four are very similar (rifle builds with normal stats) the last character is a bloodied build with like 25 points in each stat. All characters have between 4-6 industrial water purifiers. The bloodied guy will have 5 water in each every time I return to camp. Always, has been this way for months. On my main level 179, I could wander the wasteland for an hour and come back to maybe five total. Not sure why this is occurring, but I play for at least a few hours every day. And it‚Äôs consistent.
---
Spelling is hard.
---
Yesh I just saw his video now
---
Ps4 original model
---
The standard performs like a flame thrower, so faster damage at close range. Crystalized barrel works like an automatic rifle, with slightly more damage per shot, so longer range.
---
I like it , I just think you're willing to look past a lot of bugs if you think it's good.  Granted i left for 9 months but I come back to here's a patch. Oh look it brought back bugs from the beginning. I n one year they'd not patched launch bugs, added nuclear winter and back packs. If any other franchise pulled this people wouldn't defend them so much.  I agree the game has much potential just bummed it's still in the same state a year later.

---
I have a junkies commando that uses weightless armor and chameleon mutation, it's pretty stealthy and doesn't die much. Using the auto stim perk helps a lot since they added stagger to every enemy's attack it seems
---
Good luck!
---
If you don't know it yet I would learn it, there's no telling if you'll get another one.
---
Batch crafting.
---
I think it was mentioned as a qol improvement a year ago, and it would help so damn much.
---
This is what I heard.
---
If I remember correctly, you could break down ammo in new Vegas. Give us that option, where I can take this 10k .38 and craft something I can use.
---
That would be amazing to be able to sell blueprints!
---
What I don't understand is why blueprint budgets are arbitrarily smaller than CAMP budgets.
---
solid suggestion..
---
you should only get specific ammo types as a reward if you also get a weapon that uses it..
---
scrip for the ammo machines is brilliant
---
This is the only game where im experiencing these issues. Setting the game on full screen instead of borderless doubled the fps from locked 35 to 72(im not sure if its locked or not but it only sometimes goes 1 frame above most times it just stays 72)
---
 Just got it for the quest. Straight to the Station and scripped it. I used to just sell it to Phoenix, but now we have Mrmrgh. ;)
---
It happened to me today too, but I closed the application and when I opened it again it allowed me to log in.
---
That made it worse lol. I couldnt delete any of the stairs or floors I added.
---
Well I‚Äôm not downvoting you, I‚Äôm merely explaining why pvpers might see your tactics as cowardly and shameful.
---
Ive done that multiple times. Still nada. Powercycling my PS4 rn for the second time.
---
They won't live up to people's expectations and everyone knows it, man.
---
Lock your fusion core generator and don‚Äôt stay inside the workshop zone because owning a workshop will open you up for pvp and people will come kill you to take over the workshop.
---
Yeah I can't stand it. Also it bothers the heck out of me that during the game the hunter is silent or not I'm any of the cut scenes then as soon is the next game comes out they are used as plot points for the story or forgotten altogether. 
---
But it is fun and I love the guns lol lydia for the win!!!
---
how do you even have hope?
---
 Any reason you can't test this? You need 5 Intelligence for a non Heavy build so you can slot your 5 Explosive.
---
Bethesda won‚Äôt do it because it‚Äôs a really good idea ü§£
---
Damn. Well, if you completely run out of options, contact Bethesda's Support. They might give you a solution within the year. Or not.
---
Same. VATS melee crash to Xbox home screen. I even reinstalled game (no different). Mine has been like this for over a month.
---
Something something glassed cavern
---
I have a plan.
---
Private way to go if you got it. Public server you run risk of hitting spots that were already farmed or dealing with others killing the legendary before you if in the same area. Unless you planning on spending a ton of time at once farming as the private server doesn‚Äôt reset on a server hop like public I believe. I‚Äôve yet to try and hit all the farm spots in one run on private to see how long that would take but by the time I come back later on many spawns have reset.
---
I ended up just making things worse and had to delete the whole camp. It wouldn't place back down when blueprinted. Guess I'm just gonna make a new one.
---
Yep
---
I mean it is like this with most FO and ES games. In FO4 going into downtown Boston was asking for issues lol even in modded. But after time it gets better. I think I goes to say in a game where 70 of things are able to be picked up another 15 being movable and the rest static there is going to be issues in that alone, not even adding all the other programming. 
---
I think for what they make they do a fine job.
---
I already have full responders police uniform and an aa ss baton that i enjoy hitting people with
---
Does the SB have to be alive at a fissure site for scorch to keep respawning?  I read that somewhere else but maybe it‚Äôs the vein that actually respawns them and nothing to do with SB.
---
Recording your horizontal screen vertically...lol
---
U sound like the kinda guy I need son
---
They really need to work on their shotguns
---
No. They respawn even if it's dead
---
That‚Äôs not cheating, it‚Äôs called being a selfish-annoying prick who has no better thing to do than ruin other people‚Äôs fun.
---
they save the scrips as an RNG option for large holiday gift
---
Okay cool thanks !
---
Thinking of switching build and not sure what alt account has my Explosive energy weapons to test it with and want to know as well for other weapons since using nothing but power cores and plasma cores for my weapons would be difficult to maintain. Good news is I should be trimming my alts by about 14 characters as I got Scrapbox.
---
What do you sell most of? I did well with shotgun shells for a while but can‚Äôt seem to sell anything these days.
---
Your wrong in regards to army bases. 
---
Look at the hints under the UV light.
---
Think about places related to those words
---
Or maybe liberty has been sabotaged ü§î
---
I didnt even NOTICE the blacklight! Thanks!
---
Which note are you referring to?
---
The one where FS says they are going hunting and to flip the switch if they don't come back in 30 days
---
I was before yesterday's patch. I'll check today and see if I still am.
---
Do you guys know the lore. The transister was not created until years before the bombing which is 2067 the song Take Me Home Country Roads was made in 1971. That song was made with the transister so it doesnt make sense that its in there
---
Depends on who you're talking about. They seem to be living up to some hater's expectations. I would rather they didn't and surprised us with a good, relatively bug free DLC that isn't grossly overmonetised but sadly history has shown otherwise.
---
Lol same. I used to move my camp like 3 times a week
---
Same. I have a TSE fierce pump with the cards,(except explosive cards), and I have the exact issue. Great for rabbits and small game though, which is what I use it for mainly so I can unequip any shotgun cards.
---
The "switch" was an automated mail system. Which delivered the 11 packages (5 lore, 6 map fragments) to their destination. In regards to going hunting Flavia was headed to 79 and as we see when we get there  her journey ended there.
---
Yeah - let's start with you.
---
Damn those communist
---
If you buy strengler heart pa or skins on pa from atomic shop or unlockable  in NW  you can be ban this items are not intended to trade... Sry for my bad lang... boys :)
---
Ohhhh ok
---
And i just figured out Jet was made before the war so idk what you guys on lol
---
I mean, I want Wastelanders and the game in general to be a success. But we are talking about Bethesda here.
---
I don‚Äôt have either of these lol
---
I remember on day 1 or day 2 where i killed my first player i thought shotguns were amazing. The more i levelled, the weaker they became
---
as a little treat, it stacks with both that of big guns and the explosive perk demolition's expert if you attach the crystallizing barrel.
---
If you need anything else explained dont hesitate to ask. I was the guy who made the original post discovering it haha. At first i thought i was crazy then it all paid off.
---
Heavy Junkies is the best IMO. I rock a JE Gatling and a JE .50 HMG.

Mine fire and kill beautifully
---
Dang thanks for the tip, I kill em to fast
---
There are settings to manually adjust settings inside a mode.. every tv has settings to do so. You just have to turn the backlight down
---
You have to make sure the stairs you build connect the "cannot remove" floor level to a floor that can be removed. Think of it as legitimately building stairs from the second floor to the third.
---
Yeah, for sure if you get shot from five feet, you should not be fighting back after that, unless maybe you have power armor on?
---
Every legendary scorched dressed in holiday regalia has them. It‚Äôs really neat to hear the sleigh bells jingling and ring ting tingling as they rush you. It‚Äôs lovely weather for a slay ride together right now, prob bagged 10 or so since yesterday. Mostly low level, they drop plans often enough. Picked up a hard to get heavy raider legs plans and traded it for a few mounted heads earlier.
---
I like this idea.
---
I liked both FO 4 and NVegas, in that ALL the BEST guns and gear were accessible to ALL players, without the need of Luck.  But if Luck is required to keep a game going (I don't think it is, both FO4 and FONV are still played by lots of players), then make legendaries plentiful, but not trade-able, and the dupers go to hell where they belong.
---
Not sure!  Could be a visual bug too
---
Thanks for your help! I'll Google that quest and see what I can find.
---
What's the point in doing that shite?
---
They're definitely fucked up somehow lol I got a bloodied ffr fr pump action I was gonna use as a farming weapon on my heavy gunner and it's fuckin useless
---
Cool good to know.
---
I think there may be a cooldown on the ultracite ores though? I ran the cavern last night and had spawns on all but one ore at the end. Ran it twice today and zero spawns on any of the ores at the end.
---
I mean hitting less buttons would have to help a little right?
---
Isn't that the truth?
---
Looking at the Fandom wiki there is some contradicting information regarding Jet.
---
But I take it more as a slip up on part of the developers. They mention some inconsistencies in FO2, but its after BGS got the IP that it got weird, from the looks of it. FO4 has mention of Psycho and Jet being shipped to Vault 95 before the bombs fell.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jet#Origins](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jet#Origins)
---
/shrug
---
I was getting spawns last night up until I got to where there were forks in the cavern, then they completely stopped from that point forward, so I kind of saw the same thing you did also.
---
Lol duh. But the Take Me Home Country Road song was made with the transister part of it
---
You might want to start a second character with high strength.  Short of that, a Gatling gun has good damage with only 3 heavy weapon perks for 30% bonus. Of course, the Gatling isn‚Äôt on your list, so.....  Bandolier only takes two perk cards and you may already be using it.  With Bandolier 5mm is almost weightless.  So, with unlimited ammo , the minigun is still usable, provided enemies will stand still for a while.
---
Strangler PA probably. Whenever more then one of them shows up game goes slide show until I just leave.
---
Invest one point in each heavy gunner perk using 3 in total as the first rank gives you a 10% each consecutive rank only adds 5%
---
How often should you see special Scorched?
---
I just spent an hour fast traveling around the map to places people listed, and spent a while in that cavern, and saw nothing but mundane Scorched. I grabbed ultracite ore 3 times, and more normal Scorched Conquerors showed up.
---
Try to get a faster swing speed grog axe. With incisor perk it's really nice
---
I just played for an hour, fast traveled everywhere, and saw nothing.
---
Idk about him but 5.56 50 cal 5mm fusion cells in that order
---
556 sells almost instantly, other populars are 45, 5mm, and 50 cal, 10mm. 
---
Once in a while you'll get a 'whale' who'll by your entire stock of 40mm grenades, missiles, syringes, etc
---
Im one of those whales
---
I just spent 30 min in the cavern and got nothing but level 68 conquerors. &lt;shrug&gt;
---
I doubt it. They had to put an update a few months after launch to stabilize crafting due to server/disconnection issues cause items were spawning in so fast. Safe to say if someone were to hit a button and craft 1000 whatever would cause an instant crash
---
Can be, today when I did it I stayed far away from the other players tho and it still crashed.
---
They said they were gna do somethin bout that issue months ago wer still waitin
---
Oh I definitely feel that. It‚Äôs hard at first but you will eventually realize you dont need all the junk you see.
---
You can use the camera to find bodies. Look through lens and if there is a dead enemy close enough and in frame it will list the name on the screen
---
It‚Äôs RNG, and if the area has already been cleaned out by others. I‚Äôve seen none for awhile, then sometimes 3 at a time. I‚Äôd say just go where there are usually a ton of scorched and just keep server hopping. Personally I am going to start concentrating on fissure sites and the glassed cavern.
---
I‚Äôm curious how much dmg you do per hit
---
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense though as you wouldn‚Äôt be over there until the near end of the main quest. Anyway I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what is going to happen.
---
This is a good idea. I have a melee with one perk of each in commando and can still do real well like that.
---
Thanks! I only play melee so I‚Äôm always unsure about who‚Äôs buying what. Usually I just try to dump the random stuff in front of a vendor or at my camp. Appreciate it!
---
something, something, darkside
---
I once bought a tse gatling gun from a guy for 2k back when the game came out  he asked me if he was a terrible person for sellin some of his clearly duped 200000 of every weapon for 15 bucks i said no he then sold me more for dirt cheap i still use that weapon best purchase ive ever made in this game
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
&gt; I actually wish the game had not contained any legendary gear at all.
---
Then the vast majority of end-game would not exist
---
Do the event Leader of The Pack. You‚Äôll get three low level 1 star legendary items each time. I got a level 5 Instigating fire axe that I used up until about level 35. It was a beast. Good hunting.
---
Yes. 100%!
---
Make a new character with high strength and level it up during double xp weekend.  poof, now you have a home for those heavy weapons and can switch between 2 toons with different playstyles.  
---
The problem you have is you'll never get a lot of mileage out of heavy weapons with 4 str, and respeccing so you can will most likely break your current build.
---
hahAA
---
Privilege?  Many people work very hard for what they have,  I grew up on a cotton farm and have literally been working my entire life.  My family was too poor for me to have video games as a kid and if I choose to enjoy them now that‚Äôs my prerogative, I have every right to enjoy my hard earned success.  Jealousy doesn‚Äôt look good on anyone, work hard towards your goals and they will come true.  But maybe think twice before you cast judgement on others.  
---
I don‚Äôt think OPs aim was to brag but rather to discuss.
---
tank killer doesn't affect automatics, put a situational perk in for it, like glowsight, or Concentrated fire Etc, as tank killer is for a rifle build
---
Sounds like a solid plan to make better use of the machines. Unfortunately they have to find a way to make us pay for it before implementing it.
---
Thanks!
---
that wasn't the point...beth said they'd release it to steam later...unless we shouldn't trust them to follow through on their promises
---
I'm a whale who buys the 10mm because its the best silenced pistol for late game
---
there's no point.  Bloodied has more damage than junkies, there's no scenario where you would be better off using a junkies than a bloodied weapon at low health or vice versa at high health.  
---
The main benefit of junkies is that you can achieve solid damage without the handicap of low health. If running full health doesn't appeal to you then just remain bloodied.
---
yes this almost always fixes it. if you cant find an event try poseidon or monogah, usually fast travelling there will spawn the power up \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ event.
---
Put the spiked mod on a board.  Has a slow swing, but a long reach.   Also very quiet, I‚Äôm able to stay in stealth with an Instigating Board.  Under rated, imo.
---
this is the solution that works without requiring anyone to log out and then back in.
---
Uuuh what about that song *requires* the transistor? It was originally performed with acoustic instruments (and was initially pressed on 7 inch records, which were viable before the transistor was). They had been recording and distributing music pre-transistor as well. Nothing says they couldn't have just used the tube based equivalents to accomplish the same thing.
---
I got me a two shot auto grenade launcher and I'm starting my own Appalachian space program
---
Try pulling the power cord out and pressing the power button a few times to clear the cache and plug in and retry
---
super sledge, grognaks axe are both good.  modded sledgehammer is decent, and nothing can beat a vampires buzzblade for regen - you will never use a stim again outside of exceedingly rare scenarios.
---
Are you using a bloodied build? If that's the case just move one point to Intelligence then use Nerd Rage and Stabilised.
---
If you are using a full health build then still use Stabilised but the 30% damage in STR will be crucial.
---
It was Flux for me, I am a casual player so that was a huge hit to me.
---
I really hope you mean reboots, and not reset, that would be really bad :)
---
have you tried switching to fullscreen instead of borderless or vice versa?
---
Have you tried diff. screen resolutions to see if that changes anything?
---
Does your PC just go black and then restarts, or do you get any error, or popups?
---

---
This is what I use. PA is a must, I use strangler heart with emergency protocols, but if you cant find people for the raids t51b or x01 are good options
---
There‚Äôs another Misc quest to visit the lookout tower near there.
---
Believe that one is started when you read a note found on a dead responder.
---
556, 10 mm , 50 call and .308 sell very very well. Others sell less frequently. If you are a non-PA build, Fusion Cores sell well but only if 75% or better. Key is to sell most ammo that is not a specialty for 1 cap a piece.
---
I would really love it if I could leave a workbench on even the 2nd try. How is this bug still an issue? Also the pipboy light still flashes so you didnt fix that bug either. Please its like your trying to force me to buy repair kits by making be dread using workbenches. Between having to swap out perks to repair and having to exit each station multiple times it takes me forever just to repair equipment make ammo and food. It makes me not want to play because all the stupid tedious tasks required to play the game are made that much harder. It should take me 15 min max to make a pitstop and the time is double due to this and many other UI issues with workbenches.
---
Depends. I have a Quad double-barrel and if I'm faced with a group of Ghouls it's still a pretty solid option for me to blow legs off. It's got me through Vault Raids and I still trust it. 
---
But I solidly use it as a secondary weapon only. It isn't good enough to use primarily unfortunately.
---
I haven't tried with other resolutions, and I don't play with borderless ( I use fullscreen). The PC just goes.black without any warning and start to boot up like it just got turned on.
---
Same here. I farmed scorched locations for 5 hours today and found 2 holiday scorched
---
That's hilarious.
---
I'll have to look into that one.
---
We‚Äôre just lowly regular mutants, you‚Äôre just the strongest boring mutant, and we‚Äôll most probably never be super.
---
Best commando weapon I've ever used so far is a Bloody Faster Fire 25% less vats cost handmade.
---
Since it doesn't appear that you're going bloodied, I guess AA with the same 2nd and 3rd would be good too.
---
As for your build, take 1 point out of each rank of commando and max out Comcentrated Fire, it increases accuracy and damage per shot. Why do you have the power armor perk in strength? I would swap that out for something else personally.
---
With adrenaline x5 it‚Äôs in the neighborhood of 400 ish explosive damage with the Gatling when I‚Äôm mowing down mobs. With the .50 I don‚Äôt recall damage per shot, but I switch to that because of the ROF when things get troublesome.  I can be more specific in a few minutes if you‚Äôd like. I have a quad explosive harpoon that does over 1k damage without sneaking.
---
Ya no worries. Figured it out farming legendaries before. If the server is especially laggy, it won't have a chance to trigger before you kill them.
---
would you mind share your build/perks?
---
normally I check them every hour or so
---
Or just more caps and actually have decent amounts of ammo at dispensers.
---
The complete and utter lack of anything good at vendors coupled with Jack of all Trades characters makes caps useless and any attempt at an actual economy irrelevant.
---
It's definitely best to do this in private servers, I tried to farm fissure sights in an adventure world earlier and it was nothing compared to my own private world. Some fissure sites didn't even have a Scorchbeast or any scorched.
---
That is pretty much the king, Fixer had slightly higher damage, but 10 more rounds in the max clip on a FFR weapon rules in my opinion.
---
all a big buggy mess as usual, some events do not give rewards, no gifts from the big advertised free santratron either! REALLY GET your shit together  or do a test server already, many free willing testers to help!!!! get your head out of the sand pls!
---
Fortnite BR and Creative are free when released it was STW and thus a 60$ game 
---
second Bethesda and the DEvs of fortnite are both Tripple A games 
---
third Bethesda has never made a mmo which are a completely different beast
---
BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Check misc?
---
Shotguns are freaking pointless, which is sad. IRL, if I shot someone at close range with a shotgun, they would die. In FO76, if I shoot a level 1 weak feral ghoul at close range, it does not die, because the "accuracy" of the weapon is poor. Also, the glitch or effect where an enemy's health declines and then rapidly increases, as if they used a Stimpak, is especially noticeable with shotguns. My understanding is that shotguns used to be crazy powerful if you had all the related perks, but then Bethesda nerfed them.
---
You‚Äôre going to have to cite some evidence to support that claim.
---
Fortnite when it came out wasn't free as Save the World mode was out 18 months before BR so when I said WHEN IT CAME OUT it means it wasn't free.
---
Full screen isnt resolution... you still didnt identify any game
---
Please answer the questions if want some help?
---
Does concentrated fire only increase damage in v.a.t.s? Also do you have any AA weapons for sale?
---
I'll double check again. Thanks!!
---
The cryolator is a big gun?  I did not know that.
---
It was most likley supposed to drop with Wastelanders and delayed along side it
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs tied to wastelanders. You are quoting old info.
---
Let them float. They just want to be happy.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much the only option.  The pipe pistol is somehow even more underpowered and the pipe bolt/revolver are slow.  I‚Äôm hoping the upcoming Gauss Pistol will be good, because pistols need some love.
---
try going into your computeradministration, logbook, system, and see if the details around the time it happened tells you anything.
---
not on an english windows here, so might be called something slighty different
---
Wpuld love to. Give me about 45mins till when im home and ill post my whole setup.
---
I've had varying luck. For a couple hours there will not only be holiday scorched, but tons of legendaries everywhere. Then I'll go an hour or two and on see a couple.
---

---
Your chest mod should be emergency protocols, and with low HP you‚Äôll be tankier than you‚Äôd be with full.
---
VATS is main damage source for commando. Critical hit frequency is how you maximize your DPS.
---
Core consumption from VATS AP consumption is main issue. Solution are zeroVATS weapons. Powerful automatic receiver, aligned long barrel, dot sights, forceful stock and any of the fast reload magazines - ballistic rifles modded like that consume 75% action point less than standard variant. Find a gun with 25% less VATS AP cost legendary mod, configure it as I specified and it will cost zero AP to shoot.
---
Your crit frequency and FPS will be amazing and you‚Äôlol still be tanky.
---
Have you done the new grafton pawn shop quest line? Apparently a decent bit of lore in it if you‚Äôre into that.
---
800 levels over 7 characters says no, i don't know what being burnt out from this game is like xD
---
I work every other week and every single 2XP weekend has been during work. I work 12 hour days with an hour commute so I don't get jack out of any of these events. Same with every purveyor sale except for 1 so far.
---
bear arms tho
---
My Junkies Explosive shotgun does a lot of damage but the problem is that when you shot something the game wigs out and give the target back some health so something that should die in one shot, i have to shoot 4 or 5 times
---
I have it... interested? :)
---
Good to know, what did they do exactly?
---
Sweet tato stew keeps you in the fight and your belly full.
---
Yeah ik,  I'm not disagreeing with you. Its just a ball-ache adjusting settings between games. All my titles are digital so I game-surf quite a lot. Playing something like arkham knight after FO76 with reduced brightness is near impossible.
---
Cram_sandwich scammed me and stole my BE handmade....
---
You get to leave?? Must be nice. I'm stuck listening to the heavy gun fire loop until the queen is dead, then I can finally move again.  So many times Ive showed up and dumped just about enough ammo into her to get rewards and then it just locks until she's dead and I get absolutely nothing in return for the ammo I did waste. Annoying to say the least.
---
You don't get keycards from US supply holos. Go to the Enclave bunker and get tracking info from a computer in the military wing. You can also find the cargobots randomly around the Whitespring train station, in Watoga, or the southern half of the Mire.
---
Try to shoot the engines with your rifle.
---
Cleared out Morgan Trainyard, didn't see a single one, as I'm leaving all of a sudden I heard the telltale bell sound playing &amp; about 6 scorched had spawned, 2 of which were the holiday variant.
---
Something funny going on with spawns I think, this happens to me out front of West Tek frequently. I'll clear the whole area &amp; about 6 muties spawn about 190 feet from the front door all clumped together.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I could help you shoot one down but yeah I just use rifles to shoot them down. If you shoot their 4 little engines they will slow down considerably tho.
---
I have some krill for you
---
It does. The pip boy numbers don‚Äôt show it but if you turn on damage numbers you‚Äôll see a huge difference. Comparing health bars will also show a huge change.
---
I haven't seen something like that happen yet. But yeah, something is up with the spawns when it comes to the holiday event.
---
Came up to me and started hitting me, shooting me and doing the exact same thing to my cousin. My cousin shot back and killed us both... XD (most of them were bloodied builds as well so they were high damage. Thx for the comment
---
Plans inside containers are not static spawns afaik. It‚Äôs randomized.
---
I just heard about it. In Grafton?
---
That sound ridiculous, so that 25% AP reduction stacks on top of the 75% AP reduction of the specified modifications? Also what automatic rifle is best? Handmade or combat?
---
Maybe once in the last 20. I hardly have any issues with it lately. PC also
---
I love scorchbeast mixed meat stew. Those are worth celebrating with a tasty homebrew.
---
Hmm, after asking around, yeah few my friends have had probs on the base PS4 model. Same probs with dailies being glitched etc. Wonder if its something to do with hhe pro having more base rescources to load all the data correctly from their server side.
---
So he‚Äôs famous/known for this then :|
---
How long were they hitting and shooting at you? Just playing devil‚Äôs advocate, but some people do that to see if others are down to pvp. If you shot back after a short time then some would consider that ok. Just depends on the situation (and whether it occurred in a workshop of course)
---
I ran through the cavern this afternoon and mined every ultracite ore spot and got 2 santa spawns.  YMMV
---
You can put wrapping paper and gifts into a display BTW.
---
Yes that heavy gun fire loop is incredibly annoying, I get it now and then to /:
---
Shooting me over and over even after I died the first time
---
Do you mean nuclear keycards?
---
The cargobots from the holos do not drop nuclear keycards, and they will land as long as you are at the right spot, just wait for it.
---
Nuclear Keycards drops from those randomly spawn or spawn through picking up a mission from the terminal in the military wing. The cargobot will be guarded by 3 vertibots.
---
To shoot down one of these you might just wanna shoot with your guns, the missile launcher in this game is kinda weak. If you cannot shoot it down then don't even bother, do events and level up to 50 and farm some good stuff.
---
They have ammo vending machines everywhere that go untouched. I don‚Äôt know anybody even In a pinch buying from them.
---
Speaking of things we‚Äôve never seen in the game before, today I went to Morgantown Airport and it was overrun with Protectrons. No Scorched whatsoever, just Protectrons.
---
I run 45 and railspike. Sell pretty much everything else. GT is npftech. Camp is west of warehouse. Let me know what kind and I'll make sure I stock it. 2and character is melee and camp is south of Harper's ferry.
---
Also if ppl are down for pvp they can go play the nuclear winter BR so there‚Äôs no excuse for it
---
Y‚Äôall bitch about everything
---
Also had 2 guys coming up trying to provoke me at my Christmas village. They kept shooting me, trying to start a fight. I've found I enjoy annoying them so that they just waste bullets shooting at you. In the end, they lose out.
---
Perfect idea
---
I believe so, and I can check. What platform are you on?
---
Imagine not being a mutant in 2019...
---
Puny humans. So small. So... ***weak.***
---
That‚Äôs a good counter
---
Psycho was prewar
---
I have killed 3 so far that were legendary, but not holiday.
---
Seems possible
---
West of Watoga*
---
Just an FYI this is against this subs rules. May want to read the sidebar before posting.
---
Fortnite STW was far FAR more polished and functional than 76 at launch. Yes it had issues, but nowhere near the issues 76 had and still has and Epic Games was on top of their game and improved it within a short time span.
---
See above.
---
Fallout 76 isn't an MMO. It's a survival game. Play an actual MMO. WoW, FFXIV, etc. There's no comparison to 76. Besides, even if it was an MMO, that's still no excuse for an unfinished game. I can understand SOME issues, lack of proper content, because they're not familiar with MMOs. But that's not the issue, the issue is the game is unfinished and broken. Big difference.
---
There is nothing. I searched in every place a log would be... nothing.
---
The bug happens very fast, like it was a problem with PC's power source or a black out.
---
What I find it so weird is how it happen (specifically on buy/craft menus).
---
Ok sorry, idk but it‚Äôs handy to have this info
---
Like you keep server hopping? If you took an item from a randomized static spawn, then it's not going to be there again even if you jump servers. Much like loot containers. Items only start respawn at static spawn locations and world containers after you looted a certain number of items afterwards (I think it's around 150-60)
---
Okay thanks, Playstation.
---
Running the game through my steam link creates infinite load screens.
---
Did they damage you? Sounds like they had pacifist on.
---
To avoid that, dupers have sold some and given some away to unsuspecting players, to be "nice". Now by your logic, an honest player that doesn't know shit about the game is banned, which in the end causes more losses for the company.
---
Pretty sure that damage scales with level. The other day I had a decent fight with a level 19. He used a Handmade and did a lot of damage.
---
yeah thats kinda weird, but i agree, sounds like power issue, but only in certain parts of a game, naah
---
You can check in the Atomic Store, if there's the sleeping bag pack in the C.A.M.P. section, you got everything.
---
I definitely would like a human vendor. That way it would be like shops
---
I don‚Äôt see much about this but the seeded RNG is what I pay attention to most before spending my scrip.
---
It used to be much easier when you could farm a nuked Whitesprings and end up with 30 - 40 legendaries no problem.
---
It was easy to see the RNG then when youd have three to five Vampires or Bloodied or whatever that that was what was heavy on the server.
---
They definitely damaged me, it seemed like it only took them one or two shots to drop me too.
---
This literally happened to me about a week ago.  Level 80, decent power armor and a gatling plasma that tears through most.  I was taken out like I was wearing paper and holding a flare gun.
---
I have it too now :)
---
Mabye your just bad?
---
I nEeD tO pLaY sInGlE pLaYeR iN a MuLtIpLaYeR gAmE
---
Upvoting this. But Im pretty sure I've seen someone datamine or find something out about them bringing in ammo converters, so I feel like they'll just respond with that's what we really wanted all along. And then make us pay for it.
---
At least I‚Äôm not the only one, I was pretty steamed after it happened
---
They are suppose to be coming out with something like that with wastelanders IVE HEARD. Take it with a grain of salt, but most leaks have proved to be right in the long run
---
They aren‚Äôt listening and if they are it will probably become part of the subscription.
---
Just drop it off at my camp by Summerville, licence to grill, Appalachia's finest outdoor grill and fine dining experience. 4.8 stars.
---
Edit: I should mention that each star is actually an asterisk, each refereeing to a fundamental fault with the establishment
---
But.. I play solo anyways? I only use the private world for the occasional workshop grinding.
---
Still, playing solo doesn't mean I can't interact with other people. Always got my mic ready :)
---
Nice info thanks.‚ò∫
---
Im pretty sure they nerfed them. Along with explosive weapons(like the Fatman and all). I literally had to change my shotgun build cause it just wasn't enough power. Now I'm a bloodied stealth rifleman/dcg. I made my second character a bloodied explosive and then I found out they nerfed that. I went to a queen fight where I should have been pushing 12k+ damage with a FATMAN, and this SBQ had like 3 damage taken out. Yeah it'll kill anything else, but it isn't endgame at all.
---
Hahahaha I was about to unleash until I saw the name üòÇ
---
I didn't say he killed me, I said he did a lot of damage. For the record he got me once and I got him about 12 times. 
---
But he was clearly using a PvP build on a low level to bait other players. Good tactic if you know the build.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap each and fusion cores for 25 and they still sit for ages. I get a fair number of visitors, too. And most of my legendaries are normally in the 200-500 c range. I need sales so I can buy more wrapping paper!
---
I was melee for almost a year - whisky and psychobuff were my ammo
---
Now I dabble in ultracite 5mm, but still mainly use my guns. 
---
By which I mean my arms and my 51 strength special
---
Thank you for your help, kind Sir. But, does it look like I searched or does it look like I asked the question instead.
---
I only played for a hour for this event so far (last night) and I didn't come across a single special scorched. I went to all the places that have them that I could remember. Top of the world, Camden park, Morgantown, and a fissure site. And nothing. :(
---
good point
---
I am. PS4?
---
That's disturbing.
---
Yeah, I keep server hopping and it is not there, and it is not random you get two outfit spawns and the Nuka cola power armor paint.  The problem is they are not there,
---
Good points all around. Fusions cells are another whale ammo type. Mostly for those stealth boy Tesla PvP folks. 
---
Ammo at 1 cap per is a good rate
---
Ah, that explains alot. :/ That bums me out I spent a hour yesterday going everywhere and didn't find one and just went to sleep
---
I am leveling up a character to try and do junkies. I was wondering if the addictions wear off over time or once you get addicted you don‚Äôt need to worry about it.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, normally I hold my own pretty well but this guy just shredded me.
---
My experience grinding for 18 or so hours of this holiday event is that 1 in 20 scorched are legendary, 9 out of 10 of the legendaries is a holiday legendary.
---
If your cousin shot back and isn't on Pacifist, it's on him. There are ways for people to game the system, but it sounds like your cousin just gave them what they wanted.
---
Yes, but it's randomised. Meaning that it has loot pool to spawn there. In this case 1 of 3 outfits. 
---
If I was go there see there's an outfit, think I don't want that, don't pick it up and server hop. The outfit would change, it would be a randomised spawn of 1 of 3 outfits.
---
However, if I went, picked it up. Thought, I don't want it, Server hopped, the possible spawn of an outfit wouldn't be there because I picked up on a previous server and that static randomised spawn location will not reset till I go pick up/loot 160 (whatever many) items from the world or world containers
---
Yup
---
U selling them
---
well pvp in this game is a lot about gear
---
if your character is dedicated towards pvp you will easily kill a pve character way above your level 
---
the key is armor penetration, damage reduction perks/gear and fire rate
---
a sledgehammer is just to slow and as you probably dont use incisor your not good at penetrating armor
---
as your opponent was attacking you he was clearely dedicated towards pvp and used an alt account wich he equipped with good gear
---
junkies for example can be done from level one and give you pretty much endgame damage output 
---
if a lower level attacks you and you are a standart build dont fight back, they clearly know what they do and have more advantage than youd think
---
That‚Äôs the joys of PC gaming.... Cheaters just can‚Äôt resist... FairPlay out the window!
---
Nice combo - I love the black cowboy hat.  Hunter's coat and black cowboy hat is the same combo my alt character has :)
---
My cousin didn‚Äôt know how to play the game it was there first time playing. lvl 435+ grieving a lvl 6 cmon it‚Äôs still too far
---
Cranberry Relish is a wonderful way to get ahead!
---
Yeah, I just got out of a "match" where someone (that I can't name because of rule 9) killed literally everyone on the map in 3 seconds.
---
I dunno why they find that to be a good use of their time, but I won't be playing that again.
---
Alrighty. I'll hyb in a minute
---
I see them all the time.
---
I see them from time to time but definitely bot as much as I used to see them.  I server hopped 3 or 4 times the other day looking for some and had no luck.
---
What even is the point of doing this? I can't even imagine getting some kind of sadistic pleasure out of it, as you can't experience your "victims'" responses.
---
There are people who like legit competitive PvP, and who shouldn't be lumped in with griefers. They shouldn't be forced to go to NW, just like you shouldn't be forced to PvP with them.
---
I should add - I am 100% a PvE guy, and I haven't had to deal with PvP stuff in ages. Just don't put yourself in a situation where they can take advantage of you.
---
It's exactly why I'll never game on PC. PC has the biggest &amp; worst tryhards and cheaters to ever exist.
---
How do you have to cheat on easy mode M&amp;K?? That's just pathetic.
---
Why are you wasting your limited and precious time on this this earth trying to spread negativity to a community that you arent even part of?
---
What‚Äôs the context?
---
  If Adventure, non-workshop zone, then pacifist mode would explain it.
---
People sell them for cheap because lots of people have them and you just have to find the right server. I got all of mine and my friends serums for cheap.
---
You decide you either open it or dont and drop it for someone else
---
That is super helpful thank you
---
I‚Äôve been seeing some lowlevel legendaries without xmas outfits as well (PS4).
---
Console Master Race
---
Fark. I really hope there's never crossplay
---
That happen during SBQ the enemies were nowhere to be found did exploring for flora they were all clumped in a massive group and it crashed my game
---
Yeah I just watched juiceheads video and saw that they are legendaries. I guess il have to server hop tonight. I guess this is where fallout 1st is kinda helpful if I had it.
---
I can afford it
---
this work on all playstation 4s?
---
Try a Gatling or LMG.   If its AA or Troubleshooters, thats even better.
---
Failing that, anything with a high fire rate.  if you are tying to hit them with a bolt action... VATS one of the 4 engines, if thats possible.
---
nuke cards are not delivered by the same cargobot that is called by the government supply Drop holos.   
---
Strategic cargobots cannot be summoned, and are usually, but not always, escorted by 3 strategic veritbots.
---
Ammo is not gone... But weapon is often unloaded.
---
That's what I meant.
---
I still dump that stuff in train station containers
---
Just drop it when you see a newb to keep people from snagging it
---
Yeah.
---
Idk... it works EXACTLY like if the reset button was pressed, and the OS reboots afterwards.
---
That's a good karma thing to do bruh
---
Fusion cells don't sell like crazy? Huh.
