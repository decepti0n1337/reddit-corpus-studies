I like the wheel better than fallout 4's "tap tap tap" system tbh.
---
---
---
Okay I'm curious how much are the suits really worth sold one to a guy for 1k pirate suit
---
I would love a glowing dead body, we had a mod on 4 that make them emit a purple haze once the weapon was put away. I am all for helping the disabled, especially as a deaf person and in a wheel chair... I know deep down they don't care, but I think posts like this help differently-abled people know they aren't alone.

idk it kinda looks identicle lol . Its got even the little baggy in the same spot.
---
Want some cheese with you whine?
---
ONE named community manager did post, but it was in another "WAH MY ELITE 1% STATUS ISNT WORKING. I CANT PLAY LIKE A POOR PERSON PLZ HELP" thread.
---
95% of the time I get 3* drops from her but I always do a lot of damage to her before I swapped my build I would always get 1/2* drops
---
This should be pinned lost 3star marine chest piece
---
At what point are you going to figure out it's time to stop supporting this game?
---
&gt;  Looks like I mistyped the date in the thread title
---
You sure did.  On what planet are there 30 months?
---
These are the kind of vendor shops that send me to Alpha silo.
---
Gonna say 4 raids a year along with 2 big story content updates would be great, I mean heck they somehow pump new zones out with tons of new assets and armors a year xD
---
I don’t actually need them but I use them and the subtitles are pretty off / even bad in some instances. 
---
Squinting at you liberator robot. 
---
&lt;talks in chinese&gt;

:)
---
THIS. at the time I posted, it was 100% true. Once this thread started trending, they shifted gears.
---
One might even speculate that this was the OPs goal all along but I guess I wouldn't know anything about that.
---
duuuuuuude
---
This was hurtful
---
at the time of the post, it was absolutely correct.
---
They seem to actively be avoiding the topic of the subscription.
---
What's the limit?
---
PC players can edit there custom ini file to prevent it from playing
---
I've seen that dialogue about stealing it before, as well as a dialogue to 'search' that yielded some resources.
---
PLANET MURICA, SON!  CHOO CHOOOOOOOOO
---
Exactly the same here. I have a group that are aiming to get raids done and ever since I got fallout 1st they have been so smooth it's crazy. No waiting for terminals to load or doors to open or anything, when we do free range the brahmin react to the "herd" command so much more, when we do project Paradise it's so much smoother, never a problem with habitat a spawns, you can pick up the toxic goo from the  barrels INSTANTLY! That's just a small amount of things, very sorry to go on but it's another game on these servers!
---
Followed instructions.
---
Got distracted by the devilshly handsome man looking back at me.
---
Forgot what I was supposed to be doing there.
---
A very controversial post.
---
Sure, for 700 atoms....😂😂🤔🤔🤔
---
AFTER this post
---
Well conti ue to think...one day...or not...you will realize how much you are.
---
No other game company comes close to BGS.
---
 No other games out there satisfy the itch I have like FO and TES.  I am also very excited for Starfield.
---
 To each their own.
---
Thanks.
---
Played a few hours last night, didn't see the event come up once.
---
Got some selfies around the entrance to Spookysprings but that's it.
---
I need it
---
Better to just attach a price tag to any suggestion to shame Bethesda for profiteering off our own ideas.
---
It’s rare but could happen. I’ve had radscorpions and other oddballs just flat out change on me mid shot.
---
Judging by this sub's reaction to most things, it's going to piss people off regardless. I'm not excusing Bethesda as they do tend to rush a lot of buggy stuff out the door unless it makes them money (which is a bit annoying but understandable as their initial sales flopped big time) but this community seems to be especially critical.
---
Woth most everyone I've read about having problems on consoles the problem has nothing to do with their internet connection.  When the game full on causes your system to crash to desktop (or whatever the equivalent for consoles would be called) that isn't due to having a bad connection.
---
In the data miner PSA they broke down how sneak worked, and if I recall correctly the specifics are rather hazy, however sneak bonuses from armor are redundant after the first one.
---
Been saying this since day 1.  All the hunter cards are audio only too. (Beeping for caps, mags, bheads, etc.) 
---
It's rather inexcusable in this day and age.
---
That's gonna cost extra. Custom Soundtrack Pass incoming shortly.
---
Hopefully you meet them again, it’s a small world.
---
this things worth 15-20k on the market right now lol
---
Got the vault boy one today at noon.  Dont have the mobster one yet.
---
Damn caught the astroturfers right on time lol
---
Theres a link in the banner of this sub redditfor returning players
---
Oh no I'm so offended what will i ever do 😬 hahaha seems to me like you're triggered 😂 fyi the keyboard inside your cellphone lol
---
I got the mobster.  Learned it.  Cant find it in my camp menu
---
They could put a lot of Halloween themed outfits in the Atom shop and make a fortune on pay for cosmetics, but they are too busy finding ways to lie to customers and put things like additional stash space behind a paywall.. so.. yea
---
 Explosive bloodied
---
Bloodied
---
People like you 100% deserve whatever this game ends up becoming.  The game is already well on it's way to becoming nothing but a means to feed the whales, and people having this mentality will only speed up the process.
---
See that is the kind of shit you do in your torture room not you shop room...
---
Yeah. It’s nice.  When I want to grind ill go to a private world and not worry about others taking my grind spots.  When i want to do events i just go back to public.  The survival tent and junk stash are very convenient
---
You also get 1650 atoms.  So if your buying atoms you might as well get first.
---
All your replies and comments have been worthless, the mods would be doing this sub a favor in perma banning you.
---
This and locking/favoriting items in the Pipboy that are important. Nothing more heart attack inducing than almost selling or dropping one of your legendary items or flux by accident.
---
It’s more like a private session. It would be as if your on a normal world but just solo. Once you leave, your workshops and everything reset. Your camp stays though as that is tied to your character and not the server
---
[removed]
---
It crashes for me on PS4 sooooo much.  It's hard to do and there's outfits I really want but RNG isn't my friend and I swear if I miss out because of this, legit canceling my fallout 1st cos I'm really getting over this shit.
---
I love it 
---
Sounds like Bethesda's problem
---
Bloodied faster fire rate is top tier. Especially if it is on the fixer or handmade
---
you reaLLY gOT noTHING betTER To do then add commas to peoples posts? dude get a life im fucking lazy and rarely use commas Mr proper english ... nobody fucking cares
---
I joined the game just before the pioneer scouts i think.
---
The extremely rare masks, were made too rare by the sounds of it
---
I forgot to mention this was a joke.
---
This is unironically was my experience for the last few months.
---
Thanks for the comment!  
---
I think that's what the original commenters was trying to convey, placing it without it disapearing...
---
mine got laagy a few times but I've never crashed from it are you on pc ps4 or xbox
---
There is still very little proof that they dropped during the event. During that time, a lot of people entered the dev room and got a lot of sweet stuff. All the rare masks you see now on the market or on players come from the dev room+ duping.
---
Thanks for that! I'm definitely having a blast but, wish I could get a pirate and foreman outfit. Got the Whitespring suit, but not much else in terms of rarity.
---
That's what I'm hoping for to. Fuck Bethesda, I just wanna watch this tire fire burn
---
yeah I'm a bit miffed about not being able to plant well more plants - or at least give me one potted plant I can pick for food
---
...and Fallout 1st is still cheaper than having to pay for hearing aids, implants, batteries and/or surgery.
---
For shame, for Shame ,for shame. Shame on you poopincel boi
---
At this point, for me, it's all about the goodwill and Bethesda burned it all. Even if it's good, I just don't think after this abhorrent display, they *deserve* to have Starfield succeed.
---
My old hearing aids cost £120 for a very basic set. The last set I had was .ucj more because it has more feature
---
I read the Classic plan and learned the Vault Pumpkin, I read the Vault plan and learned the Classic pumpkin, they're mixed up.
---
I see, so you where playing other games.
---
I love the event too!  Not sure what part requires teamwork though.
---
The dev room was still open then? they took their sweet time closing it 😂.
---
Id love to know what masks were genuinely available, and which weren't
---
At least try to be subtle, Todd
---
And from proper grammar.
---
Yeah but if you do it again or for too long you'll cancel the rewards screen
---
As I understand it, there's a law called CVAA, where any game with text chat has to also include text-to-voice and voice-to-text, to make it accessible to visually impaired users.  If that's true then the negative is having to implement all that.
---
Now that's pay 2 win?!? Heresy, burn the servers to the ground!  (sarcasm)
---
Yeah, they couldn't figure how exactly players entered the dev room and how to stop it. Poor bethesda...
---
Just sold a bloodied FFR combat rifle. 15k. I know i prob could have gotten more but it was taking up space and 15k was all I needed on that character.
---
simple answer its cheaper atoms
---
I love costumes so 100$ of atoms = 40$ 40$ and 20$ pack is 12,400 atoms 
---
where as 100$ for 1st is 18,800 atoms 
---
so basically 6400 more atoms - or around 40$ more free 
---
for people who buy atoms its just a smart deal
---
I found the Power Armor Edition in xbox one, the price is $59.49
---
Best not to give it attention, they thrive off of it like parasites
---
Lol
---
Does this count toward the challenge?? Haha
---
Its stupid that they left the dev room in the game at all.
---
Id like to think someone at Beth must have atleast once thought "i wonder how long it take before a player enters our dev room"
---
that is very hurtful
---
If you think that Bethesda implementing this in the way they did - broken, behind a massively shitty paywall - is somehow a dunk on my sentiment, you're way off.
---
I said they'd never implement it because it required work - in other words, unless they were paid to.
---
And even then, _they've fucked that up beyond belief._
---
Do you hve trouble getting atoms? Which utility items right now do you feel are necessary that you have trouble affording?
---
Hear hear... can’t agree with this more.
---
Cause people take workshops and some times I need a break from fighting the predicable AI
---
When i saw the news i was shocked. Like why would they even have the dev room in an online game? They clearly were not ready for this type of games
---
That's even more suspicious. Which means they've been watching and didn't say anything until they were called out.
---
Don't worry about it. You'll get plenty of duplicate perks especially from perk card packs
---
I dont know, maybe the eyebot could relocate his festivities every years. Maybe with murdering raiders instead of robots next time, idk, that could be a cool feature imo.
---
Like others say, just hide in a bush and you'll make it to near the end and get 400-500 points and don't have to do anything.    
---
I'm also terrible but I play it for fun, and I hardly ever kill anyone because I suck, but I still rack up points pretty quick.
---
Dont know what you paid, but it's a beauty. Good on you.
---
Honestly the biggest thing that you need real money for is probably fallout 1st scrapbox but that is not atom shop so im a little off base with this but I hope you see what I mean.
---
I know, right?!
---
It's a beauty!
---
Damn that's a good price
---
HAhA and they don't even realize they're ignoring the protocol.
---
And again to refresh the short cut
---
lol
---
*CRIES IN FALLOUT 1ST*
---
Will do. And you work on your hypersensitive tendencies.
---
First, I’m definitely not a teenager. I’ve been playing since Fallout 1 first released, and was an adult long before it released. I’d wager we’re likely of a similar age. And for someone that’s ‘mildly irritated’, that’s a lengthy rant. 
---
But let’s go ahead and look at your Hawking example. 
---
He was an expert in the field. It was his life’s work. I doubt Fallout is your ‘life’s work’.  So that’s part of your analogy dismantled. 
---
Let’s continue. 
---
Understanding theory and having practical experiences are very separate.  Let’s say there is someone that has read every medical and surgical textbook in the world, but has never performed a surgery, even as an assistant. Do you allow them to perform a surgery on you, or do you choose a surgeon that has real experience with that surgery, with hundreds of successful operations to his credit. 
---
The answer is obvious. The surgeon with **actual experience** is the one you select. Because you know that the real world experience has more value than just the theory. 
---
No one ever said you couldn’t have an opinion. But between two otherwise equal individuals, I’ll lend more credence to the one with actual, practical, relevant and recent experience. 
---
That’s the reality of the world, regardless of your opinion.
---
It's like when you mention your dog anywhere there's a tax dammit and that tax is a picture.
---
who is we?
---
I was hoping to click on this and see a suggestion to change it to the Troll Song.
---
I’ve only finished the event 4 out of 10 times. It will freeze anytime I run or blow up a car. Once it froze when everyone wants nuts on the 1 star Sentry Bot. Fun event but terrible execution.
---
Yes, it's a "Halloween Offer" in gamestop stores, the normal price is $109.99
---
I’m not going tell you you’re wrong, I’m just giving my take on it.  Yes companies will pander to players who continue to pay for more “stuff”, and yes  Bethesda state’s from the start it would be cosmetic only, we are in agreement there.  I’m just not overly concerned as long as what they are paying for has no real impact on the game.  PvP is shit so there’s no concern there, PvE is just a scavenger hunt anyways so what’s the big deal if someone wants to pay $16 to not have to scrounge scrap as much as the rest of us?   Personally I wouldn’t mind having a personal server but that’s about the only thing in the new update I really care about
---
I'm sure they sold enough to say it was a success so there's nothing really to say they did anything wrong.
---
“Controversy” everyone is buying it that’s not crying on Reddit
---
Finally someone gets it.
---
I was just amused, it's ridiculous. It's blocking adventure player camps from popping in lol
---
Works on PC dropping plans.
---
This is exactly why i can't buy stuff anymore. They always give discounts and always come with better stuff.
---
I've been running 720p since release. Also been playing on an empty ssd. It's gotten nothing but worse. Same can be said about nuclear winter. Just ordered a 300$ xbox one x and the next gen is coming out next year xD
---
the users of this sub, fam.
---
Well since they decided to abandon there whole community for greed...
---
Ok something in your brain  clearly snapped 😂😂😂
---
This is one of those things, as a hearing person, I just don't think about often. Which is kinda fucked, since I'm good friends with a dude I met in Destiny 1 that's completely deaf and one of the better players I know that slays in PvP and raids like a motherfucker and introduced me to a whole group of badass deaf gamers that have to try harder than the rest of us.
---
It would be super cool if Bethesda could do something, here. Even if it isn't text chat (which it should be, tbh) a new radial menu with a series of more relevant canned phrases and responses would be a nice step... somethig.l, anything really.
---
The pip boy could easily implement a texting function.
---
I've got a little keyboard that plugs into my 360 controller.
---
Even though they haven't implemented it yet they have mentioned they would look into getting us more picture storage on consoles.
---
Hell, even many users discussing (and quite often stepping over the line while doing so) F1st were not our usual subreddit community. The average active user count trippled or maybe even quadrupled after the announcement. Many people just came to make noise about Bethesda and harass people who are still playing.
---
That sounds like a decent deal, I would go for it ... game is awesome so you can't go wrong ..
---
That is really unfortunate, I do know that the issue with the xbonex seems to mainly be tied with microsofts "enhanced graphics" mode with tv's that support it. Something they added into mischief night borks up the enhanced graphics stuff and causes crashes quite often.
---
they were wrong, it starts at 0 and is a separate challenge
---
Yes! I can’t hear things too well sometimes and always use subtitles, I was really happy to see that Borderlands 3 let you adjust subtitle size, I was thrilled. Bethesda needs to make letters or something a thing plus maybe make subtitle size adjustable. I’m just a hearing girl but I hate It when people who experience the world differently have walls blocking them from things they can enjoy, I am all about accessibility! I hope I said that well enough I mean no disrespect to anyone if I misspoke please let me know, I just love people being able to enjoy things no matter what kinda cards they’ve been dealt.
---
Ah, my bad. And for what it's worth, I'm sorry things have gone _this far_ to shit.
---
It's hard enough to get camps to load without a mobile camp blocking you. Player camps should despawn mobile camps.
---
the free travel point is a game item/mechanic everyone should have so the tent the tent is what im more upset about and its cuz we let the fridge and robot slide too
---
I think the inventory should be hidden while trading. 
---
We should be able to mark stuff we want to show/sell.
---
Thanks I'm stuffed though.  I just had a whaamburger and french-crys and washed it all down with a couple wheinekens.
---
you and your logic... you realize this is reddit right fueled by gfuel, rage, and bethesda bullshit.
---
Oh you were trying to use radaway? Instead how about using an emoji instead?
---
And vice versa
---
Point; you'd think I'd learn by now...
---
It’s ok friend, we all make mistakes
---
LOL my time is too valuable to waste on the paperwork to do something like this. Next level petty.
---
They implement it and fast travel only works to Vault 76,  the strait jacket fits over power armour and wild mongrels start doing energy damage and now fly.   Welcome to FO76
---
It was a joke. But on a serious note, I play on an empty SSD and still crash. My load times are more than twice as fast as anyone who doesn't play on an SSD.
---
lol, "participate" in it all the time, just can't ever find the other 2 ppl!  mayb if we talk it up more ppl might give it a try!
---
Costs less than a coffee a week for convenience. For me as I’ve put over 1500 hrs into this game in the first year, if I played half as much for the next year the convenience is worth it. Plus I store a lot of junk as an ammo dealer and mod for the Discord I’m part of. That was the biggest benefit. Going from a full stash to having half of it free for other things.
---
I have missed out on a lot of good loot today when I get killed by an enemy robot or downed. When I try to respawn, it crashes my game on the load screen. Or i load up the game and it crashes as I'm getting into the server. It's annoying. And it's making it truly difficult to enjoy the event.
---
yeah, it can be real fun but idk if ppl are even aware its an option
---
CVAA Requires on-screen text menus and program guides displayed on TV by set-top boxes to be accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired and requires set-top boxes to have a button, key, icon, or comparable mechanism designated for activating closed captioning (when built-in to the set-top box).
---
So look, not game chat, but the menu options. Which, hey, they don't do anyway...
---
With a major thing like this, I would more expect them to address it at a later date once they feel they are ready to do so
---
Open the gates!
---
Good job keep fighting the good fight against corporate greed
---
Bruh, show us  your camp XD
---
But you'll take the time to make a petty, bitchy comment.
---
Yeah bruh, you showed that O.P.
---
Very well, thanks for the opinion, I just saw the Nuclear Winter mode and it looks good to me, that already compensates the price of the game, even more so if I wait for the Wastelanders mode that apparently is the total salvation of the game
---
Xbox. Some days actually seem to be better or worse. For me at least..
---
Holding my breath until Devs reply. Get my coffin ready.
---
Would love to see a pic of a built one in ur camp.
---
Lol I was just picking. Glad it’s doing better for ya.
---
Hopefully this gets removed just like your last pile of horseshit
---
Sorry to hear that but BGS has proven they don't give a fuck about this game or community unless they can monetize it, so don't expect to see text chat unless it's part of "Fallout 2nd", purchasable exclusively for 20k atoms. Sounds hyperbolic but that is the precedent they've set.
---
I’m assuming for this to work:
---
* You live in Australia
---
* You bought it in the time range specified
---
* I’m guessing you need to prove you bought it in that time range, perhaps with a receipt
---
What's that... 5 seconds out of his life?
---
Idk about the Australia thing but maybe so
---
Xbox one have volunteers?
---
So when is it going to happen in America?
---
U cant sell mags to robot vendors. 😬
---
Frig off ya cunt
---
I read the document just now and it seems legit.
---
It's not
---
Idk, look em up on Facebook
---
Hell bethesda should add this even if it's just to get some good pr right now
---
If my wife didn’t just hijack my media room, I would have helped lol.
---
All I do is start game, check on auto fill team \[No\], and start Nuclear Winter Mode, turn youtube on and check back in 20mins and if already over start next one, back to youtube, check back 20mins and start again and repeat.
---
Most likely... Bethesda shit the bed and is already halfway down on a slippery slope so I can pretty much say that this will happen.
---
I'm sure it's probably true. Is part of our rights, that if a product doesn't work as intended, you're entitled to one
---
Okay, thanks
---
Dont give them ideas, man
---
I 100%support this
---
Non atomic shop customization options? Blasphemy.
---
I deleted the last post myself
---
Said removed before you pressed the delete button
---
Stop asking for things. This o lay encourages their bad behavior.
---
you over estimate the number of complainers because of their loudness and consistent copy pasting of complaints and toxic vitriol.  In game - (which has been running just fine for me. ) almost every camp I see has a 1rst stash box and a collectron roaming around it. Rough guess 80% of the camps give or take 10%. this subreddit is only a small portion of the entire 76 community. and of this sub reddit I would guess the toxic avengers are less than 1%. bethesda knows no matter what they do the toxic portion of the player base will never be pleased and there fore dont bother talking to them. this is why myself and many other gamers actually AVOID forums. forumites have consistantly been toxic in the past and most players just dont bother going unless google sends them there when they search for something specific. I wouldnt be here telling you this now but I cant play and came here to research but got distracted, grr.
---
Yeah, the way he put it made it sounds like it was the mods. Just wanted to clarify, but accept your point
---
Was just saying cause usually when it says a post is removed, the mods did it. Usually says deleted if the poster removed it
---
ACCC is Australian Competitive and Consumer Commission
---
So yes, AU
---
I think you missed the point.
---
In fact, I know you did.
---
I know it's hassle af with them, I just want to put it with my x01 nukashine.
---
My thoughts and what I've noticed is kids that didn't know gaming before online play are more likely to find this acceptable. Young young players  that entered after battle passes etc. were common are much more likely to defend this. 
---
Older, Atari to Sega etc. are not. I'm curious if people older than the original console kids, the arcade kids, are in support. I guess that would be a big reason to have put more age brackets. Did the normalization of 25 cents a life vs. whatever price in 1991 to own it make a difference in the shaping of 'gaming morals?' That seems like a hyperbolic term but I can't think of a more fitting one right now. 
---
It's just an interesting theory and thought to me. Did having online as your introductory base vs a PS2 or N64 potentially change your view? I don't know. There's something interesting in the idea to me
---
Did you play and like Fallout New Vegas?
---
Yeah if you into PVP and the mode is pretty fun, you will definitely get your money's worth no doubt ... I have probably over 1000 hours in the game ..
---
Did you play and enjoy Fallout New Vegas?
---
I think you missed his point...
---
That his time is more valuable than to waste on paperwork and showing up to a tribunal...
---
He never said his time was too valuable to waste on giving an opinion on reddit.
---
Come on, bro... Keep up...
---
Whine?
---
I dont feel abandoned at all stop speaking for me and speak for your self. you arent a friggin hero and this aint a crusade.
---
Only seen it this one time, but I might as well get the perk
---
Only if you show me where your dad touched you?
---
Let us hand out candy
---
It was just a lie.
---
They said that before they decided to make repeated misteps.
---
Of course I did. I am also playing the Outer Worlds right now if thats where you are going with that.
---
 It's a great game and love it but it's like a Fallout light.
---
Bethesda: Whoops, looks like OP isn’t a Fallout 1st member. Next
---
OP, you got my support. This would benefit everybody.
---
I managed to get 3 fire man helmets not the outfit.. I'm guessing it's rare or not as common
---
https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/668146/accc-calls-courts-over-fallout-76-refunds/
---
Looks Like zenimax is offering refunds
---
Looks like the tribunal has spoken
---
Yeah, I know. So fucking sad. I love this game, I love Fallout. But that doesn’t matter to Bethesda.
---
Right then your first comment can't be correct since Fallout New Vegas, arguably the best fallout game and one very similar to the ones made by Bethesda, was made by a different studio. Not to mention Outer Worlds is being called a spiritual successor to fallout new vegas. Just imagine the amazing fallout games they could make if they got the licence back.
---
The game has a few thousand people left playing. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of people never care back. Stockholm Syndrome is strong with you.
---
There is a bit of confusion over the law, especially since it doesn't really give specifics, and nothing has been tested legally yet.  But the media, the IGDA, accessibility experts - they all interpret it as covering communications as well.  This uncertainty surely has a chilling effect even if it turns out that the Communications &amp; Video Accessibility Act doesn't in fact cover communications.
---
I just want text chat because I don't own a mic and don't plan on ever getting one...plus I don't want to listen to other people...I'd rather use text chat! GIVE US TEXT CHAT FFS. We've been asking since launch...like...it should have been in the game at launch...jesus.
---

Totally does! It's kinda cool to see someone else's perspective of a game after you've dropped it - For example, some of the reasons I stopped playing are some you kept playing.
---
Hope my post wasn't taken like an attack (think /u/erncon thought so?), kinda more a "It's 4.45pm at work and I'm kinda bored so what about that game I used to play".
---
Hope you keep enjoying the game man - Fallout 1, 2 &amp; 3 are some of my favourite games of all time. I just couldn't get into 76, unfortunately.
---
I have no interest in BR because it lags too hard for me. So it sucks that I will never get those rewards... Why can't they just make it so you can play whatever mode you want to get every reward? NW is a cool idea but performance wise it's just frustrating...
---
Well, I think that's a pretty normal mindset for the sub to have considering all the lies, false advertising, and rushed things Bethesda has done throughout the last year and a half. Bethesda has lost a lot of goodwill from its fanbase and has continued to do more to lose it than to gain it back.
---
I think a key factor in when it comes to monetization in games is pre-existing goodwill with your fanbase. When your playerbase is happy and on good/trusting terms with you, they'll be willing to let more things like expensive monetization practices slide. When your playerbase is unhappy and on angry/untrusting terms with you, the last thing they want to hear is another form of monetization that you expect them to buy, especially when its for a game that had terrible and broken launch, had a ton of controversies throughout most of its lifecycle so far, and already has very expensive microtransactions that break the promises made prior to the game's launch. Bethesda should be focused on getting goodwill with their playerbase before thinking about more ways to milk them for more money.
---
Can't tell if this is sarcasm, but if not it's ironic considering you once mentioned getting disconnected multiple times was pissing you off, but hey no complaining.
---
"Could just be a dude that REALLY likes the game, could be a PR account"
---
Never called old mate a PR account. Was more interested after finding a person that in a subreddit of (outside looking in) overly negative comments someone that seemed to like the game still. I stopped playing ages ago but we all know Reddit is an echo chamber for complaints, so was interesting to read someone's take on it who has a history of liking the game.
---
Yeah, I know, don't know how much that helps with Dylan's case since they don't have it anymore
---
Dont sweat it.   Depending on the perk, you will be able to upgrade it so its even better that it is now.

It wouldn't have been. If this sub, the first non MMORPG sub was successful we would have seen it in many other games locking off things we right now enjoy for free. 
---
In no world would this sub ever be anything more than anti consumer and highly dangerous.
---
Surely there are some great WV ghost stories! I've grown up visiting the Smokies and they have their local tales.
---
Live service........
---
Because it's bethesda?
---
Time doesn't mean anything whatsoever.
---
So the fact that other games don't have text to speech...
---
Total sarcasm.
---
The complaining was directed at the people saying it was my internet connection, which it isn't/wasn't. Somebody else commented the same thing was happening to them, and not to beleive the people saying it's internet connection.   Something in the game was/is doing it.
---
Source?
---
Are melee builds still good or where they nerfed
---
ghost that we knew.
---
South of vault 76, but I don’t remember exactly where off the top of my head.
---
nope, but it's finally shown back up after a few log in and log outs...weird...
---
A subscription to game libraries is fine. 
---
Subscriptions to each game is not.
---
I will gladly deal with in game spam so this poor Dutch woman can walk again. Merry Xmas.

/close
---
Also, get it.  If you every buy stuff (real money or earned atoms) in the stom shop you get 1650 atoms a month.  I personally love the private/personal servers.  I love the game, flaws and all, but I do like to be able to enjoy some alone grinding when time allows it.
---
nuke to win!
---
Crashed twice on the Halloween event.  Got nothing.  Fast traveled to One Violet Night and it crashed just before the end and I missed the Legendary and most of the loot on the bodies.          Then when I tried to open my inventory it froze.
---
Bethesda, why can't you fix these problems?
---
Trick shouldn't be murder..haha
---
No one is complaining about the low level developers though? And the hate is fully deserved?
---
So, like never gonna happen. Just tease us like a horse with carrot on a stick dangling way out there. Keep going. You will get to it. Hang in there.
---
Hard habbit to break... fallouts are the only games I've played pretty much since fo3 was new
---
I stopped after my 12th crash. Fk it.
---
Uh wtf does the overpriced MTX store that sells non cosmetics do if not fund continued game development??????
---
Only a thousand huh.... ok...lol
---
Looks like Victim mentality is strong with you... funny thing is you announce your leaving on a sub dedicated to Fallout 76... lol
---
See... even you can’t leave...ha!
---
It's not fair to expect the Zenimax owners to have to hold off on the down-payments for New York Penthouses &amp; Monaco Yachts until 2021.
---
I never hear of it either.
---
Best I can figure, its like punji sticks...heck of a trick ....
---
Wouldn't surprise me if it was game stability issues, you did also mention you're fine with the broken issues in game but 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I'm pretty sure his post was a subtle reference to that.
---
Honestly I just want the volume to be adjusted via the sound slider. They said they added the ability to change the menu music volume while queueing for NW, but I never saw how to do that.
---
It's a piece of music, it's not that much of a problem, if you don't like it just mute it in the menu and play your own
---
Then you did your part. No point in putting them on blast here.
---
Atoms are worthless, it means nothing 2k atom could be valued at any real life currency. But if you believe it's worth your money do whatever.
---
Couldve reskined assets to give it a Halloween theme because fuck lore these days right
---
We've gone this far, may as well have some fun
---
I think ir remember hearing about this when it released. And if I remember correctly moat denials were only on pc.
---
They are annoying, but not annoying enough for me to stop playing.   My biggest fo76 personal asshurt moment was.... Fighting a queen, falling into a fissure (had all my junk on me because I was hoarding legendaries pre purveyor and had no stash space), trying to recover my bag which was in the fissure, and walla.... Blue screen.  I didn't play for like 4 days after that.
---
Bufftats, Berry Mentats, Psychotats, Fury, Stimpaks. Little bit of everything.
---
and add text chat k thanks
---
It’s a pain in the ass and no better rewards (worse if you don’t get out of your PA at the last second so it counts). 
---
I’d advise hopping to a different server if you see Whitesprings nuke incoming and you plan on doing the event.
---
its not a completely virgin server either - its got dead mobs and missing loot drops often which suggests that its a leftover empty server. still worth it for me when I have very specific goals though. ie I was down to 10 waste oil. I went to a private server and I took wade airport and the beckley exhibit. I played around with defenses while not worrying about players, was able to do the defend events without being a crouched and stealthy all the time. its nice. combine those two shops with going out and collecting the oil from the grafton monster spawns, blackwater mines, and other places I cant think of without checking a map. I was at 200 waste oil pretty fast and it was nice not worrying about moron pvpers pushing their pvp agenda down your throat like 7 day adventists. pvp in this game is stupid, pointless,expensive, and you have to sacrifice most or all of your quality of life perks in order to stand a chance.  I just want the shop resources. private server is great for that.
---
Omg so it’s not just me. I thought I was going crazy.
---
Luckily it stopped for me last week but it was infuriating.
---
i never trade. The items I don't want are for sale at my camp. Players always try to trade to rip you off and offer crap for your good items you are using. I just ignore players who keep spamming trying to trade.
---
Maybe this is why they're delaying it, to Completely overhaul the system
---
Bluescreens are almost always hardware or driver related.
---
I’m pretty sure it is cause it’s working and your hero is the community of people standing up for your rights to not be scammed
---
Also, I know I am one of the people who doesn't think your case will go too far, but it will still be a pleasant surprise to me if it does
---
Of course its a success. 1 month sub is what you can buy the game for at retail
---
I tend to get no loot off the Queen once it's been killed, or I crash half way through.
---
But yay subscription services /s
---
I know they are worthless, but they are used to buy stuff. Some people do pay for atoms, and 1650 "free" a month would cost more then $12.99 a month.
---
... means they were either developed before the law affected them, the developers didn't think about it, or they have a different take on what the law means to them.  Like I said, it's not yet fully clear what effect it will have, and it is bound to have had a chilling effect.
---
Check out IGDA's page on CVAA if you like.  " CVAA requires any communications functionality and any UI used to navigate to or operate it to be accessible to people with a wide range of conditions, from no sight to no color vision, no speech to limited strength. "
---
Check out gamasutra.  " The CVAA requires that communication functionality like in-game chat and the UI used to navigate and operate those elements must be accessible to people of varying sight, motor, speech, cognitive, and hearing ability. The requirements themselves are outlined in the full legislation,  specifically in section 14.21"
---
Check out RPS.  " The changes means that developers should, where appropriate and as much as is possible “with reasonable effort and expense”, ensure text and voice chat are accessible without hearing, without vision, with colour perception problems, with limited physical dexterity, with cognitive or intellectual disabilities, and so on. "
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And so on, and so on.  The industry in general thinks CVAA covers in-game chat.  Whether recent games choose to abide by this interpretation is up to them.  Some will not take chances.
---
Nite there is a time window to get back I to the same session. I've tested it and used it to trade with My other characters.
---
What matters to Bethesda is money
---
Lol David s pumpkin was the first thing I thought of when I saw the pumpkin suit
---
Im on ps4 so that must be the case for a lot of players i guess
---
Its just too perfect.
---
&gt;  its got dead mobs and missing loot drops often which suggests that its a leftover empty server
---
No it isn't. This has been debunked.
---
That's odd getting no loot, I assume you are hitting here with bullets correct? 
---
That was the only crash I have encountered during a queen battle.  I'd say I've been in like 40...  Not a huge number, but 1/40 isn't to bad.  Mischief night....thats at a 50% crash clip.
---
That’s even worse, bro bro.
---
Oh my! My adhesive manufacturing became much easier!
---
9
---
I’m half deaf (lost hearing in my left ear) and I full agree with this, I wish there was a text based chat somewhere and plenty of games I think need to try implement bigger subtitles or options to change the size for viewing ease while running around and reading.
---
They will
---
Careful, the mods like to ban people who call out cheaters/scammers. Cause the actual scammers/cheaters are fine, in their eyes, I assume
---
I first solo'd the silo around your level, having armor that reduces damage from robots, energy resistance(for the asultrons), some rad shields if you're not a power armor build , something that cripples(i did it with a shotgun build and didn't bother killing a lot of the respawning robots I just left them crippled) and patience as it's a bit of a drawn out affair thought not too difficult. Some people also stealth most of it which is fair way to do it too.
---
That's not blue screening. It is a blue screen, but "blue screening" is a Windows thing.
---
That's why they included it, it gives players a routine. Previously players would be hesitant to purchasing atoms to buy stuff which meant Bethesda made no money, giving away 1650 atoms (which costs Bethesda nothing) makes the 1st thing seem better and almost worth the deal.
---
Run to drop site v9 and repair the turret and let it shoot them down.  If you run far enough away from SBs they quit chasing you.
---
Or just let it go and get back to playing, or go play other games
---
I'm guessing its because of rule 9. There is no need to know the users name. We cant do anything about it, so it only encourages people to seek them out. 
---
If the ticket was filed, then everything that can be done is already.
---
Yea I’m not happy about the scrap box either. I don’t think it should exist at all.
---
There is a challenge to collect candy while in a mask/costume
---
Personally I like knowing the name, cause then I can know who to avoid in the future, if they play on Xbox. Just think that rule is dumb, imo
---
They don't care about you anymore, only their fallout 1st pay pigs
---
Yes, if I fast travel when the event starts it happens to me
---
Thanks, I just did it and it was tough. Im a melee build and I mainly use a deathclaw gauntlet but I was using power armour to get through  the rad area so I couldn't use it lol. I just nuked whitespring and it was fun until my game froze in a loading screen. Anyways thanks again
---
Honestly, I'd pay 12.99 a month for the scrap box alone.
---
Thanks for reminding me. But I think ppl have the right to know about this issue in nuclear winter.
---
I have deleted every scrap of Bethesda on all of my counsels and unless things get better won’t be purchasing any of their content from now on 
---
They don’t care about us so why support them?
---
They do. Unfortunately Bethesda hasn't really done much about cheaters, from what I understand. Hopefully they get on that asap
---
Yeah I usually use the mini gun or handmade, when I go and inspect the Queen the loot menu would be empty.
---
I tend to get crashes when the Queen is half way or if I die and respawn it crashes and goes to dashboard.
---
Eh, ok. Whatever man.
---
McKamey Manor looking sweet tonight.
---
I'd rather put that money into another game imo
---
Ok so if he requested a refund prior to June he can get one. That’s nice... still seems silly to me but whatever lol
---
Lmao I bought fallout 1st as soon as the update finished. Y'all freak out about it but it's not that bad if you think about it. It's like $13 ok. Im in high school and work part time like 12 to 15 hours a week and drive a v8 suv that im always paying gas for and insurance and I can still afford it so it clearly isn't that expensive😂
---
When it's empty thst usually means no hits registered.
---
That's lame.
---
Whatttt. My game lags like crazy on PS4 I’m so jealous.
---
Half the time the ghouls don’t load in for a few minutes and the robots never aggro to me as I’m shooting them.
---
That is weird. Probably some syncing issue with the server. I’ve noticed that sometimes with quests. It always seems to right itself eventually
---
No thanks to the zombies all still paying for these scams...
---
Yep. Horde Events and and Earth Mover also count.
---
Well you say bluescreens, and me being someone who works in IT, blue screening has been a Windows thing for at least 24 years, so excuse me for going with established meaning.
---
So they misled customers about their rights to a refund. I just want to make sure we are all reading this correctly. This isn’t saying that they misled customers about what fallout 76 was or would be.
---
yes it does. I live right next to monongah, theres 3 typwriters in the tent across the street from my house. they were not there. there are also always 3 supermutants or 3 ghouls in the power yard for claiming the fusion core generator and those were missing as well. I literally walked in and claimed with no mobs to kill. whoever"debunked" it is full of shit.
---
Thank you kind horse, roam free now, unshackled from the bugs of this time.
---
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted
---
You are right that "gave" is the wrong term.
---
But it is not uncommon for retailers to have a contract with the publisher. Sometimes, when a large number of the items are not selling, they can return a portion of those items for a return on their costs.
---
I think when Epic gives "minimum sales" guarantees to the companies that sign an exclusivity deal, they are basically agreeing to permanent hold those copies.
---
Mainly, the point was that depending on wording, you can sometimes tell if "sales" actually meant "demand" by consumers. And for Borderlands 3, it was clearly mentioned as "sell in" to investors. (Though not in the massive number of articles that came after that weren't paying that close attention.)
---
Ha, somehow I knew that a follow up answer like that would come. A classic r/iamverysmart we got over here!
---
With you man. I hope they get their shit together, I really want to see this game improve, not ptw stuff like this. Ignore the bethesda bots in here.
---
Same lol. I wish they were orange on black like his outfit though. There are so few memorable SNL skits of late. This is a rare exception.
---
also there were dead supermutants at westek already as well. some were meat piles when I arrived.
---
1,200 max on commando build. Ideal situation. Night time sneak attacks with relevant perks, critical hit, full adrenaline stacks, gunfu.
---
Weapon is Quad 50% critical dmg handmade.
---
Hasn't happened to me that I've noticed, I can't imagine that they'd take stuff away you bought, not on purpose anyway.
---
That law states that cunsumers have a right to get the product repaired....
---
LOL.
---
They claimed Aus. consumers were not entitled to refunds, which is contrary to Australian law. 
---
So they good the finger wiggled at them and put on notice.
---
It's an interesting read, the ACCC document.
---
# VOLUME OPTION PLEASE
---
Shame it won't happen any time soon. 
---
People were asking for this during the beta, launch, and months afterward.
---
You need to have requested a refund as well during that time period.
---
I have 0 problem with this event I just a rubber band and went afk on the roof of the white spring I got many of the new plans and outfits
---
Good on you mate, keep it up.
---
Hmm, ok cool. Thanks :p
---
Correct. I just don’t want people misreading the title here and thinking it is something that it’s not. We have enough hysteria on here already.
---
Yeah so what does it do without sneak? I’m starting to think my handmade isn’t as good as it used to be and I’m thinking of respecing
---
Phew! Im hoping my mate is just mistaken. I just dont see why they would do that really.
---
That is not what they ruled on. They mislead consumers about their rights to refunds under Australian consumer protection laws.
---
I bought 2 subs day 1 before I had thought about it. I regret it with every fiber of my being. I didnt really realize the ramifications of what I had done until it was pointed out to me, and now I am sick to my stomach for supporting Bethesda. I not only gave both accounts away, but I will never buy another bethesda product again, and who cares? Outer worlds is great and wastelands 3 is on the horizon. I have real fallout under a different name, I don't need this sham shit dumpster fire that happens to own  the copyright.
---
Salt?
---
Yeah, that wouldn't make much sense.  Mistakes do happen, but make sure all the local options are checked before contacting anyone.  But if you're sure it's gone (and that it was there in the first place), you can try putting in a ticket.
---
I only have 78 damage on my handmade. After armor, it doesn’t do anything meaningful. This is why I am built the way I am. Maybe I can hit 300-400 damage with a non sneak critical head shot.
---
Well post was removed lol
---
With my lever action rifle, the 24 percent armor piercing perk, going for headshots and the sneak 2.5x boost, I get anywhere from 200 to 1,200, depending on how much armor the creature has. I'd say the average shot is around 300 to 500. It trends higher for things with low protection (ghouls, scorched) and low for things like robots. I also use the Tormentor perk in Luck, since crippling a limb usually "stuns" an enemy, and it's useful for the scorchbeasts to force them to land.
---
rubber band your sticks together so you run in infinite circle.
---
Ah so yeah mine must be okay then, just wondering what the kind of biggest damage perception builds we’re doing now
---
Ok thx
---
No way I got one and it mama one of the really rare in game items.
---
Yeah I get just over 300 with me lever action but it’s nothing compared to some mele builds I’ve seen
---
dont do that. you need to go to a location, pick a corner, start running into it and do whatever you need to do to have your run stick / key continuous keep  going in that direction.  could be manual, could be autohotkey, whatever it takes. should keep you up indefinitely
---
I only have like... 8 perception and 35% weapon damage. I maxed out agility and luck because you get a ton of damage from all the stacked multipliers. If you build and play right, you will outdamage people with good legendaries free aiming all day.
---
Yeh had a brief few.hour  headache
---
How bout starvation ?
---
I have a TSE 25 Lever and I usually do 300+
---
Did you go pick pumpkins before crafting it? The atomic shop ones take plastic, while the ones we get from the event require actual pumpkins
---
You'll starve to death!
---
Nice now I’d preferred real life but which we talkin here
---
I do the above at my camp with the Happy Camper perk maxed out. 80% extends your hunger and thirst quite a while. I throw on Homebody too just to be sure.
---
I want a ghost costume, like a cheesy sheet ghost.
---
They haven't addressed FO1st at all.
---
I'm aware people are doing this, although it seems incredibly daft.  I don't know about you, but by the time I leave a world and load into a new one - let alone load all the additional bits that Mischief Night creates and sync with the current state of the quest - it's been more than a minute or two.
---
I’m trying to do this while being able to mooch off mischief night like a lurker know an exact spot it’ll work ?
---
I love it. FINALLY I have enough room in my inventory.
---
hey , downvote me all you want but this game is shit and designed to do nothing but keep me and other weak people spending until the end of time. just because outer worlds helped me wake up and I am saying something, desnt mean your dumb ass cant keep feeding the machine, I just want to help other 'whales' realize what they are doing to us, and message them individuallyu to help them break away from this cancer that was barely ever a fallout game.
---
It's a sheepsquatch encounter
---
I've done it maybe twenty 20 times on xbox and I'd say at least half of them ending up making the game crash in one way or another.
---
Well if they mean the regular surprised pumpkin, it is misleading to call it a Jack O' Latern since it doesn't light up.
---
They kill just about anything.  Set my camp up near a spawn point and got a black cat one day.  Kitty took 2 steps and caught 8 rockets to the tuchus.
---
I personally like the inventory management aspect of the game. There are so few challenges and it actually forces you to be thoughtful about what you keep.  If I had the scrap box I would just have a lot more asbestos, glass, and cloth that I don’t need lol.
---
"We've now removed ALL visuals from the game to cater to audiophiles. UI has been moved to Fallout First exclusive."
---
This,
---
T51 with a skull mask.  Works
---
There are two different surprises jackolanters. Look at the one that requires pumpkins as an ingredient  it isn’t lit up if that helps.
---
I'm missing three Jack O Lantern plans, keep getting multiples of the plans I've already learned 🙃 such a pain in the ass
---
Cool! Is it part of the event or something?
---
This is the case for all the jack o lantern plans. They are same as the ones at the pumpkin house.
---
I know this post is for full health, but with my instigating lever action (1 star) and if I gate my health to 15% I can get over 4700 damage with a head shot, this includes adrenal reaction, nerd rage, bloody mess and full on sneak, but it doesn’t factor in possible explosive damage, night time sneak attacks (3.75x damage instead of 2.5x) and also vats critical hits
---
Thank you
---
Yes. I'm bringing another complaint, with a different agency, concerning another issue with the game. 
---
It's heartening because:
---
 (a) I have to provide documents to the tribunal, so mentioning this verdict may undermine the credibility of the company's counterargument
---
 (b) Australia is a big enough market that fear of similar judgements may lead to video game manufacturers being more conservative in their marketing, and less avaricious in their business models.
---
 (c) it is to my initial point yesterday, small scale consumer action leading to broader reaching decisions, that this judgement from the ACCC occurred. I'm not saying my claim is any more or less liable to succeed, purely that not trying is a certain path to failure
---
You won’t actually starve to death but it’ll bring you within an inch of your life.
---
Oh goody 🦆 thank you my fine man
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, at the same time, this is where the community is.  Its sort of their job to be here.
---
Still, you're right - even if people don't like their answer, it doesn't help anyone if its hidden by a low score.
---
Yea u shorted your self but I know that situation well. I'm usually at 20k caps on my toons. If u come across a bloodied pipe revolver, I'll be your new best friend :)
---
My game is in french, the thing is that the pumpkin that doesn't lit up are called "pumpkin" in french and the one that lit up is call "jack o latern". The plan says surprised jack o latern.
---
That means they didn't bother translating are switching the names.
---
I don't think so, I think it's just an Rng encounter
---
Hate it with a passion(inventory management). I like the exploration and fighting aspects of the game, crafting, changing perk cards, inventory management, they all grate on my nerves like fingernails on chalk. my character is literally built around avoiding those things. the scrap box is perfect for me because I dont even have to open my inventory to pick and choose just dump and go.
---
Well your description above was misleading. Probably why it was removed.
---
 woow that was amazzzzing
---
Video of you deleting your characters would top it off... I won’t wait for that...
---
Submit a ticket? So a carved pumpkin in French is just called “pumpkin”?
---
Another one of these.
---
Cya. You'll be badly missed
---
Bethesda
---
To each their own. Just feels like there is no challenge at all with the scrap box.
---
you wont ever die. you will need to make food when you come back,  but as long as you have a couple purified water and cans, you are good to go for days.
---
Well if I translate the name of a carved pumpkin, it goes like " costume pumpkin of halloween" which makes no sense
---
It’s a bunch of dead super mutants and a single surviving, crippled mutant. If you let it chase you around for a bit it’ll say things like “Scared..” and i think it’ll mention a sheep or baa-ing. Obviously meant to suggest that they’ve had their mutant arse kicked by the sheepsquatch.
---
Your friend is mistaken. If they aren’t seeing it they should restart the game. There is probably some syncing issue.
---
Nope, but on PS4 I'm getting a power armor bug, that seems to happen when I load in wearing it
---
They should show a video of them deleting their characters... either they don’t have them or they will be back...lol
---
I have no idea. I don’t speak French. I would call them both a jack o lantern, just one is lit and the other isn’t.
---
They said servers would be a paid service in September 2018 FYI
---
I'll blame it on bad translating honestly. I would call them jack o latern too, but the game decided to call them differently and doesn't write the good name for the plan...
---
I miss the nights being actually dark.
---
Downvote me, Bethesda still doesn't care about you lol
---
Lol. Definitely submit a ticket. They tend to fix localization/bad translations with each patch
---
 It’s a good catch.
---
I haven’t had the power armor one in awhile. These stinking glitches!🤬
---
Sent you a message, and added you on xbox. GT: DezzerrahJ
---
Different glitch this one either unclaims it when I leave or it's a display bug, but it fixes when I reenter it
---
How about you jump in a boiling vat of oil Ladydevann?
---
Just got 4-5 in tonight across a couple characters my son and I have.  One run was really bad tho.  After the event I went into white springs to check plans.  I discovered a bunch of bots and Assaultrons were in there and they aggro on I was not in power armor because of the event.  Tried 10 to get my loot bag but no go.  Regular armor not good enough.  
---
I have seen the bug where loot shows up on enemy corpse for half second then disappears.  Very upsetting
---
Eat shit bitch
---
Very important information for any Australians who tried to get a refund but could not and yet this gets downvoted.
---
Speaks volumes as to the kind of people on this subreddit.
---
I honestly hope all you Bethesda twats die in a fucking fire
---
Not in a long time. I do remember that happening for a short while earlier this year.
---
The option for replace, refund of repair is more the choice of the company than the consumer, though in some instances, the customer can demand a refund irrespective of what the company wants.
---
Same here im running 268mbs 18 Ms ping on my ps4 pro and it crashes often but only at white springs.
---
Yeah but most people don't or they might as well just use a computer.

Random encounter added with sheepsquatch a few months ago

&gt; Normal carved pumpkins = "costume pumpkin of halloween"
---
In french too? I play in spanish, and the pumpkins are named "disfraz de halloween", literally halloween costumes. I've noticed some other mistranslations during the event, like the "light" promp on the bonfires, they translated to "ligero" which indeed means light but as in "light armor" not as "light bonfire"... oh well.
---
I want a low budget power armor outfit.  Like the legs and body are just a printed sweatsuit.  And the helmet is a plastic face plate with the elastic band that still shows all your hair.
---
Add me - SEALofGOD_3. I'm mostly on in the afternoons and weekends. Would love to play with you! EST
---
If not forgotten, much like with cosmetics-only in the Atom Store, they've decided to break their commitment.
---
I wouldn't be at all surprised if they wrote an Inside the Vault article stating that the lack of communication is in response to our feedback.
---
This has happened to me! I had the cat lawn statue and the future tec globe, after spending some time away from the game, I come back and they're both gone. Can't build them or anything. I sent a ticket only to be asked to get a screenshot of them in the atom store showing I own them (HOW CAN I DO THAT WHEN THEY'RE ALSO NOT THERE?) They checked my account and apparently there is no record of me owning those items so they closed the case.   
---
I haven't put any money into the game, all items I buy from the atom store are from Atoms I earned or they were free items. I thought I was crazy with this happening, but hearing it's happened to someone else is nuts! I hope they can get further than I did with the support team!
---
Lot of cucks already. I sincerely hope you get targeted when you have your NV gear on.
---
Or you could just play the game instead of wasting space
---
I'm game, but to balance the tables- no team benefits, no mutation damage or resistance bonuses.  just flat armor and perks. All legendary events on weapons don't contribute to damage. That would be interesting. Especially to see the skill
---
Drop something useless first so the bag appears, and then transfer items into the bag. The items are probably falling through the terrain.
---
Same thing for the "light" of the bonfires... I don't feel alone anymore yay!
---
I'll do a ticket for the french one, you should do one for spanish too!
---
I could get in board with that
---
They got me excited thinking I got an atom item lol..
---
You and your astroturfing friends can rot. I'd delete my guy, but I'm never launching the game again, already deleted it.
---
Yes but I’m tired and also wish to be productive in my own self interest
---
Front or back entrance??
---
How about Bethesda just responds directly rather than using third parties (if that's even happening at all)?
---
See absolutely no problem with downvoting BS PR.
---
If you get the PA Edition, get it purely for the collectibles, that way if you’re disappointed with F76 you haven’t lost anything and might be able to make a few pennies back if you sell just the game.
---
Remember the communist salute? I don't.
---
Have fun in the shit game with you and your three friends. I was level 120 or something, I know not super high, but obviously I played. There's about 500 other games that aren't as broke or as flagrant in their bullshit
---
Because moderator bots don't exist right
---
Yet you’re still here... in Fallout... hey look your post was deleted as well
---
Mods, can you pin this to the sub? It's pretty important information for any Australians that have been wanting to get a refund but couldn't.
---
u/Cyrus224 u/_Synecdoche_
---
Ha ha ha. I can't believe you got downvoted. It's so true.
---
I mean realistically theres no challenge after level 60 or so, I dont play for the challenge I play for the atmosphere music exploration and cool camps and players I run across. I dont kill the queen because shes a challenge and I "need" the loot. its more of a pull the lever and see if I get something cool and I get to see other players show up and we fight in a big group. inventory micromanagement does not enhance ANYTHING I enjoy about the game. it is a bitter pill I have to swallow to get out into the world and the things I do like. my main is level 363, the game has stopped being challenging for 300 levels for me. by the same token I never feel bored because theres always so much going on. telling you man. not having to stop, scroll through that stupid count meter thing and tediously and strategically drop piles of scrap on the floor has improved my game play dramatically. when you have somehow accrued 2000 steel but you need to keep at least 100 for repairs scrolling over is annoyingly and obnoxiously long and tedius. THEN you have to rinse and repeat for woood, glasss, cloth leather. all crap as a high level you generate a metric shitton of. finally get your inventory clear and in an hour or so you have to go all the way down the menu and do it again. fuck that with a crate of fucks. its the single biggest annoyance in the entire game for me. I LOVE the scrap box. know how much steel I have now ? ME NEITHER! ITS GREAT LOLOLOL I AM FUCKING FREE! scrap and GO!!! how much glass do I have? YES! how much specifically leather do I have?  uuuh YUP! how much cloth do I have ? uhm that way ! --&gt;
---
Yes it did say something about a sheep. That's pretty cool thx for letting me know
---
Jokes on you. I have no friends
---
If you’re on PlayStation it actually saves to your capture gallery which is the next best thing in regards to infinite album storage without F1st and if you have the PS Messages app you could send the pictures to an alt or friend and save them from there as well
---
If that doesn't prove my cuck theory... Enjoy the dog shit world you're helping create.
---
Normal shots for my AAE Laser are 84+9 x4 on my Commando Build. So like 372. A little over 700 sneaking. I don't bother with vats or headshots.
---
Yeah, we know it's already been posted twice now.
---
Give me ur gt and ill msg u when I have 25k caps

Happened too many times to be a coincidence

Sweet, now more people will know
---
Oh sweet summer child.

&gt;Discussion
---
Fair enough, I respect that.
---
the real Inside the vault was sent to 1st people, us second class games only get an abbreviated version.

Yes, this! I live seeing the love my camps get with those snaps, and I'm sure to return the favor when I see some great stuff.

And I really would like to see any evidence where you claim he is most certainly one person. See what I did there?
---
I’m down to just the mobster pumpkin missing from the pumpkin plans.
---
Let me know if you disagree, but there’s only one workshop I grab for making caps.  There are some where if I need a specific resource, I’ll take the workshop and will fast travel back there to collect my stuff.  However, one workshop has a crazy amount of water production.  You can put 4-5 industrial purifiers down and gather 16-20 purified waters every 10-20 minutes.  It adds up so you can sell them at vendors to max out your caps every day.   Maybe there are other ways to do that, and I also supplement with loot that my fallen foe give me, but it’s a pretty easy way to get caps.  Especially if you’re multitasking.
---
That would be the right thing to do frankly.
---
You still here??? Can’t get enough Fallout can you? You’ll be back... lol
---
Someone gave me the pirate outfit for free after they read that comment but I'll still try to snag the fixer plan floating around my trade group for you
---
Okay, the price of the power armor edition is $59.49, "Halloween Offer" is good for me
---
Let's hope the mods do. Whether they pin this post or make an announcement post themselves. Either way.
---
How many more people will post this without looking first that it’s been posted a dozen times so far???
---
your "build"? lolz- sounds like just about every player. Most players in PvP are sneaky sniper builds.
---
Ight I expected to get a little bit more downvotes if I'm being honest😂. But actually tho why are things like this bad for games like I've heard they are but I've never really had a problem with it in my experience
---
I thought there was an update that kept people from collecting rewards unless you actually helped with the event.
---
Hey, I'm working on my first playthrough, about lvl 22 right now.  Im working on a melee build because I have apsolutely no ammo. If you have any extra decent melee weapons I would love you forever.
---
I would LOVE to see an area chat for NW.
---
Lol A1 reference.
---
YES!  And it's unreliable.  Try swapping weapons out. I had a shotgun, switched to my Rifle, and I tap left (?) to switch to previous weapon, and it brings up my Gatling gun that is out of ammo, WTF?
---
Or worse, when you are in combat and hit a square to reload, but at that moment ghouls are flying around you so suddenly you are given the option of taking Toothpaste from the corpse.  GAAAAAAAA.
---
In combat, I think the tapped square should always be reload.  Press and hold it if you want to do looting (or some other key entirely).  Nothing is worse than getting stuck in menus while at the most critical moment of a combat.
---
And this. Who releases an MMO style game without text chat? Oh wait.
---
Most people feel this way, or similarly. I understand the want to rant but this isn’t going to help you.
---
Ok
---
I love you, I support you and share the rainbow keyboard love as well as samhain &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I think so, but I can verify later (my kids are on the PS4 right now).
---
FO4 had a superior hot-button system, imho.  I understand that they had to add more context to the hot keys because of emotes, but the result was something far worse.
---
I was here to complain about why I was leaving. Idk what the fuck your problem is though, some sort of Stockholm shit.
---
That’s a huge steal for what you’re getting then
---
Or, they could have left at what was originally said. Pay for the game and free DLC. But they shit all over that too.
---
Yeah, it’s happened to me twice in the last few days. The first time it resolved itself after about 30 minutes where it would finally start switching to the right weapon, but tonight out of nowhere it started again. Now I have to switch to my specific guns with the quick selection wheel (or whatever it’s called) as a work around. Bethesda why are you this way!? lol
---
Although I have found the best thing to do with somebody like this is just wave high and be friendly.  Offer up spare ammo or whatev.
---
Who the hell cares
---
to put it in perspective - take one thing that always slightly annoys you and do it once per hour for 2500 hours. then have a way to no longer need to do it. its glorious. it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders.
---
You're right, but I don't care. Nothing we bitch about will fix anything. I mostly just want to vent and maybe someone from Bethesda will feel bad about it, but that is honestly too much to ask for.
---
Or to work out how much they can charge for it. Seriously doubt it will be free DLC ag this point. 
---
Fallout 1st was a test to see how many people would buy a subscription from them. You can tell that from the answers they gave such as 'more people have bought fallout foret than expected' hint hint nudge nudge.
---
Wastelanders will cost money in some way or form I reckon
---
I've never finished one, but I wish I could. The friend I play with isn't comfortable playing with other people, and the two of us haven't been able to complete it together.  If there was a queue or lfg system for it, I'm sure I'd run it with randoms when she wasn't on though.
---
As I said, to each their own. Each of my chars are all around level 130, so I get it. I just see no need to keep things I don’t need. I
---
Keep on using similar term like Stockholm as others... not even original...
---
Do you complained... congrats! 
---
Still here though... guess you weren’t serious about leaving... didn’t think you would...lol
---
Great idea, they’ll add it to the backlog for Fallout First releases.
---
I get what you are saying. This just has never annoyed me lol
---
WORD
---
16x the detail
---
&gt;First, I’m definitely not a teenager.
---
I didn't mean you specifically, I meant people in general. You're not the first one to use the "oh but you don't play the game" argument.  
---
&gt;He was an expert in the field. It was his life’s work. I doubt Fallout is your ‘life’s work’.
---
Well, like I said. 22 years being a fan. That's a pretty long time to be a fan of something in video gaming.
---
Also, my example obviously wasn't meant to be interpreted literally. I was trying to make the point that even though I'm not currently playing Fallout 76 *myself*, it is indeed possible for me to have a ton of in depth knowledge about the game.
---
The "you must play the game to know" argument is incredibly dumb. And I've seen how ignorant it makes people in discussions. For example, I had a discussion with a guy yesterday or the day before who denied that there were any bugs or problems at all in the game. He knew this, because he was playing the game and didn't experience any. When I tried to link him a very famous 20 minute video on YouTube, he refused to even click the link because he "didn't have to". He knew. I was wrong and he was right.  
---
&gt;Let’s say there is someone that has read every medical and surgical textbook in the world, but has never performed a surgery, even as an assistant.
---
The thing is, I *have* played Fallout 76. I'm just not playing it *now*. And I have played every single Fallout game that came before 76. So I'm more akin to a surgeon who's been operating their whole life, but only used this new method that was introduced last year on a couple of patients. A whole bunch of younger surgeons who aren't as experienced as I am think this new method is great, but I felt that it's actually worse so I went back to using the one from before.
---
oml, what if it's like super transparent floaters (A creature that will be added to the game in the next massive game update). Those already look kinda ghostly- and would be a really cool "ghost" mob
---
Dude. It’s easy to express disappointment while remaining civil. Your previous post was clearly lacking in civility lol
---
It just works 16 x the detail
---
Astroturfs *do* control this board, but it's against f76, not for them
---
Previous post was VERY civil for what it could have been.
---
Think you with your Reddit experiences would look to see how many times it’s already been posted before spamming it once again...
---
 I've done sixteen of these, now. Gotten all sorts of plans, costumes, etc. But, only 4 legendaries. Some of the times I've been inches away from the spawn, and happened to look away at the instant it spawned. Seeing everyone shooting towards me, I turn to see a dead robot, it was killed that quickly.
---
Idk, I went from 5 ups to 0 in like 60 seconds...
---
closing this thread -- it's overrun by people triggered because they find the behavior I describe strikes too close to home, and they'd rather downvote and deride those who don't agree with them.  Not worth trying to waste any more air discussing when the room is full of this type.
---
You can win if you died and a teammate wins.
---
Nope :D
---
Well... In the page of Bethesda the power armor edition the price is $200, and I like the helmet, but the tricentennial edition (the game) cost $50, and this offer $59.49 for all the PA Edition, for me, is a great price
---
Support for this post. Thank you OP.
---
Very good points.
---
The problem is that *sometimes* the assholes aren’t there, then the boss has a very appropriate amount of health and robustness.  Also, sometimes there aren’t that many people doing an even in general.   Ever done the mires free range by yourself?   Even with good gear, it takes some serious work.  If they made the sheepsquatch 5X harder, it would be impossible.  
---
*planning* for the assholes to be there, and overbalancing to compensate, definitely isn’t the answer.
---
Lol.  Then you subject yourself to something you don’t like for the “drama”.  How sad, well, I’m done talking to you, have a good one.
---
Where is everyone getting this info? I cannot ly see requirement for the next unlock not all.
---
Platform?
---
Definitely not alone hahah, they really made a lot of mistranslations this time... I'll submit the ticket then, let's hope they patch it haha.
---
I can't even trade the extra plans I've got, the vault tec logo pumpkin is called "vault tec jumpsuit plans" hahah
---
Ps4
---
...just to burn *even more* precious ammo in vain since they have pacifist on? :D
---
As long as you’re happy with it, you’ve already won
---
I have an extra helmet
---
Well, there is that mod manager that installs it all for you and websites that tell you what mods must be installed. This may help lower the time.
---
This all is very stupid anyway.
---
its not about keeping 2000 glass that I'll never use its about never having to  sort it. I dont see sliding a bar from 2000 to 100 and pushing R then pushing "ok" as challenging or interesting content. then forcing me to repeat that process 20 times in a row is just bullshit. words cannot express how huge of a downer that one aspect of the game was to my overall gameplay life. like end of the night I kinda wanna keep playing but do need to sort all this scrap. instead of sorting the scrap I would just say fuck it . log and go to bed. if bethesda really wants to make me happy they can add some sort of auto weapon and armor scrapper that works like the scrap box. obviously not on legendaries just on normal crap. and yeah I would drop a 20 for one of those in a fucking heartbeat.
---
Welp, Bethesda sure turned this place into a hell hole.
---
I one or 2 shot the Sheepsquatch in the mire when I do it alone. If 8 do it with a group I switch weapons. If you have an issue doing the Free Range event on your own look at your build.
---
Dude, just go away. If you're so done with the game stop posting and crying about it here like a baby
---
Well the ability to theoretically get the fixes we need is at when the mod support is opened....
---
However as it is paywalled and no tools or no mention of any tools to be released (correct me if i'm wrong) has not been anywhere yet, so
---
there"s no real hope to get things done even if there would people who would actually have their mind set in to it....... fuck 1st....
---
Awesome!
---
idk why you have this attitude, all I said was to leave the reddit.
---
At least for a while.
---
I saw one for the first time yesterday, too. It was raving about fur and needles or something, then after I put the poor thing out of its misery, I hears the distinctive bellow of the Sheepsquatch. I was kinda bummed when it didn't actually show up!
---
Hey not sure if you ever sent the request, but send me a message if still interested
---
I mean it’s on the compiled bug list report of known bugs
---
If you nuke Mischief night you are a dick!
---
Oddly enough they don't work for today's daily: Eat Candy
---
Yeah, shoot me an add please, I have some low level items I can give you to help you with your play through
---
Are those cabins supposed to be a reference to Cabin in the Woods, being controlled by others and all? Haven't seen anyone mention it and it's not in the lists of pop culture references.
---
You literally missed a sale via Xbox by a few hours...
---
Had to do a scan and repair for it to work FYI
---
One of this games many bugs just bit you.
---
I need this and I have no idea where/how to get it.  Google only points me here... Please help?
---
Really?
---
Vanguard melee build for reference.  IE lever action at 184 with 1 each rifleman and max demo expert.  Instigating makes it 368, crouching boosts it another 184, so 552? with minimal perks.
---
Are you available tomorrow around 4 to 6 pacific?  I'll dust the cobwebs off my twich stream for you.  I can 100% back up my claims.  But you can't.
---
Many people have. They are not old empty sessions.
---
not all are old empty sessions but not all are new ones either.
---
Yes most titles were up to 50% off. Next sale I believe is coming up for Black Friday. 
---
Best price now is Walmart. 
---
I’d get the regular addition unless you can get the tricentennial one for cheap, no game difference at all, just skins for armor and weapons.
---
It has improved, but as of the last 2 patches crashes seem to have increased
---
as ringo in tombstone says "bye"
---
Additionally if you’ve played previous Fallout games you’ll notice similarities within the game but not the game itself. 
---
First quarter of 2020 will release the first big upgrade Wastelanders which will include adding NPC’s into the game.
---
Around 2K with an Instigating Lever Action.
---
OMG, people would LOSE. THEIR. SHIT.
---
Going to copy this info over to the official boards for visibility.
---
I’m liking the game more that I’m in a discord with active players. In game text chat &gt; voice chat.  
---
The visibility of text in this game and Outer Worlds needs to be much larger too.
---
Completely agree with you on this!
---
I get a lot of wildlife like radstags, cats and beavers in my riverside camp located near Morgantown. Nothing really harms my camp items often, plus I have a free source of meat regularly.
---
That's exactly it, I feel like every Bethesda game has to be fixed by modders, and I do thank them for their service, I really do. And the shit is SOOOO simple when they do it, it's shameful how bad it is. Why they don't open it up is beyond me.
---
Much appreciated.
---
Do you guys have a board or email list or what?
---
I’ve never thought of going quite that extreme with my IE Lever, but it make sense.  In regular (full health) run and gun I do around 2K. I could see Adrenal, Sand Man, and nerd rage ratcheting it up. That said, I have a BE Lever that I use if I’m playing at low health.  It does around 2.2K damage under similar circumstances (no sandman).
---
This is interesting. People keep talking about crashing during the event but I ran it through maybe 15-20 times and haven't crashed even once. Yes, it's laggy as hell most of the time and my game crashes every now and then while I do other things, but it never did during the MN. Also, I run a literal shit ton of mods which is supposed to only make the game more unstable at the very least.
---
There's no need to be depressed about the event's rewards you failed to get, really. These are absolutely mediocre at best anyway. Also, people tend to throw away all this stuff, you never know what you're gonna find in all these bags lying around after the event. And also in player's vending machines for 10c. I personally found most of the rarest unique event rewards this way by acvident, wasn't even chasing them.
---
And yeah, if the event is so bad in so many ways, extending it for another week will only extend frustration from all this shit, it won't really help anyway.
---
actually its more of a fallout 4 style game with multiplayer added then a mmo.
---
You should be doing significantly more damage with the IE Lever.  I guess it’s because you have “minimal perks”.  I do around 2K from stealth (no Demolition Expert)
---
Ok I’m going to tell you a spot no enemies can get to you- don’t tell anyone else. 
---
Place your camp on the boat in the middle of the lake next you thunder mountain power plant. The enemies drown
---
I'll have to checkout your video, but I've found the top of the world/pleasant run is amazing for both magazines, plans, aluminium, steel and caps, if you work it right.  The route ends up being almost an "eight" as you go through it.  I can often walk away with 1-3 bobbles, the same with magazines, and 4-6 plans, plus a large bank of weapons &amp; chems that can be sold for caps, and a heavy load of aluminum and steel.
---
If somebody wants to turn the expanded route into a video, feel free to ping me.  I've thought about doing it, but meh :)
---
Along the way:
---
* Pickup every weapon, and chem, and clothes -- sell them to the vendor at the end (the gray ski outfit draw a premium price).  I can usually pull 800-1000 caps on a single run.
---
* Pickup every ski and ski-pole you find (great wood, steel, and aluminum source), and loot every corpse -- grenades and gunpowder are the usual, and grenades are an easy sell at the vendor.
---
* This /will/ overload you, but it's all good if you just accept it :)
---
* Load up Perceptibobble and the magazine perk for an easier run (you can skip areas if they aren't pinging).
---
* Don't bother unlocking anything, it's just a time-drain, skip it.
---
* At each kitchen and cabin, hoover up all the valuable junk.  Notably hot-plates, liqueur, and anything else that either scraps well, or is sellable (basically, avoid the glass, paper, and ceramic).
---
The route:
---
1. Go in where the patios between lodges open up, right up the hill from the railroad, and work your way north to the raider tower, terminate any resistance along the way, hoovering up their loot (don't worry about the two southern lodges, they are caught at the end of the loop).
---
2. Stop by the side room with the armor station on the tower complex, there are usually 1-2 plans around it.   I don't bother with larger tower complex as it's mostly mooks and is a time drain.
---
3. As you head west, there is a shelf area that is attached to the lodge and tower complex. 
---
4. Walk west on the road over to the back cabins, skipping the upper bank of cabins,  like you do in this route, check the lower locations first.
---
5. The first cabin with no roof has a mag (you probably cover this in the video), and two mooks -- get their weapons.
---
6. The next cabin on the cliffside has some good stuff, including the games and a kitchen.  Walkout on the back deck and get all the pencils (lead).
---
7. circle back and work up to the road.  You will want to backtrack to the southernmost weapons bench in a shack on the road.  There is a plan on the floor, and sometimes one on the counter.  Lots of good stuff on shelves, including mods.  Take the opportunity for a quick scrap.
---
8. It's getting late, so I'm going to summarize the rest...(again, ping me and I can help put a video together if anybody feels so inclined)... Follow the road south, pluck everything from the corpses (including in the arena), and stop at each shack and look for plans, magazines, etc.  Only go to the rear of the cabin attached to the arena if your radar perk cards are pinging.  Take the more western fork and clear out the three bottom cabins (mags &amp; plans--don't forget to look at the sidetable to the left and rear of you as you face the armor station in the northernmost of the three cabins.  Go out the back of that cabin and walk up the hill to the last and most northernmost northern of the cabins.  This one has three turrets if you are lucky.  Pop them, check the remains for biometrics -- great for scrapping.  Then walk up the hill to the motel, clear it out, head south through the long torn up lodge set, across the southern patio, around the back of the lodge, circle the base of the top of the world (more ski's and aluminum).  Don't forget to check the two armor/weapons stations, then, finally, loop the lodge closest to the train station and come around to the last lodge where the trader is at.  Take one more stop by the weapons scrap station, then head in, sell-off all the weapons, chems, etc
---
If you play it right, it's a large combination of many valuable resources.
---
It wasn't removed. I deleted it because it had my email in it and I couldn't be bothered editing and re-uploading the image

I’ll trade u a fireman uniform

Yep. PSN onmysignal98

I thought so.

Not being a dick but, are sure you have the walls facing the right way? I know the brick is easy to distinguish but the wood, if you're spamming inside walls especially, can get turned.

She turned me into a tiny deathclaw!
---
Yeah, play that version of Country Roads you used in the release trailer!
---
0. Proudly so.
---
A lot of people have been asking for this and I don't understand why it's not a thing. 
---
The whole reason "push to speak" was not implemented at launch was because it was "immersion breaking" so I guess hearing people chew gum, cough their lungs out, smack their gums, etc was totally immersive. 
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that they don't want to "ruin the immersion".
---
Hardly. I only have bought some a couple times. I love the game, so i would spend money here and there
---
its reddit. if you're posting here you should have enough sense to understand how reddit works
---
Bruh if you're on ps4 add me and come join my private server you can actually experience the damn thing without lag
---
Never have, and don't see why I would need to.
---
If a game sucks ass badly then you might need to pay to make it better, but Fallout rocks! so I don't see a reason to pay for silly add ons and crap.
---
They should of had 5$ server rentals and have a season system like battle royles have. A free tier and a premium tier
---
Yeah, I'm sure I could boost it.  I only have 3 in perception, so not sure where the numbers would come from.
---
Not bought any. Have 4k from challenges. Only bought a few things. Not alot of must have items.
---
I mean you shouldn’t have to look in the very depths of your soul to find good in something that you pay for.
---
I just blue screened after the event going to the Whitespring Station vendor bot.
---
No, it would still be something I am not paying money for.
---
I have 76 and have enjoyed what little I have played of it. The issue is that I love Fallout, but 76 is getting away form the game I love and turning into a new, multi player game with only the outer trappings of the game I play.
---
Between this and Faschnacht it has taught me that explosions are fun, just need to add some higher levels to Faschnacht
---
Halloween &gt; literally anything else :)
---
Zero. Proudly so.
---
I did, I enjoy the camp building but all the new pieces are behind the Atom store.
---
So I just bought atoms for that. 
---
But honestly, I enjoy Fallout First.
---
I rarely spend money on stuff if I can also earn it in game. I think I bought them once because I really wanted the greenhouse but it was limited and I didn't have the time to farm up the points.
---
&gt;the title says it all
---
it sure does..
---
have no fear floop I have returned because is seems like as soon as I shut down my old reddit account they took over. I will be distributing pro beth salt to counter anti beth salt  and try to bring balance to the force. ps do you still have your town build or have you moved on from that ?
---
I got it as a gift awhile ago it just sits on a rack looking cool il ask him how and try to reply to this comment!
---
Spooked
---
Didnt crash for me at the last spot. Got all the costumes already doing this.
---
Paragraphs. Please use them.
---
I think all multiplayer games should have a text chat option. It would absolutely help the Deaf community converse with hearing individuals. You got my support.
---
we are the children of Atom.
---
Atom be praised!
---
Butcher Pete is an amazing song to listen to if you're a melee build... 
---
Specially in 3 where you would just wander through camps of Raiders swinging a knife around like a maniac.
---
whine whine whine bitch bitch bitch...(yawn) done yet come on you got some more whine in there little guy lets hear a goood WAAAAAAAAHHHHH come on. one more
---
I think the two studios had to secure their own rights to songs, that's why you don't hear many of 3s in NV
---
[deleted]
---
About 25 for average, mind you,i stopped playing for year and had ~7k just sitting.....
---
But he’s hackin and whackin and slashin
---
zero
---
I’m an on and off player and Ive bought 3000 atoms some weeks. I enjoy the game and building and sometimes I just want to add a new flavour to my home. I’d estimate prob 2000 atoms a month in purchases so fallout1 would be awsome with the other perks. I’m yet to buy though as I go through stages of playing games and Taking breaks for RL like work. The thing that really draws me eye and why id purchase is for the junk chest!
---
I can't say for sure but I think the helmet sold in Captain Kids store in the Whitespring is the same helmet. 
---
But yeah, I'm still grinding for those outfits XD
---
I bought an atom bundle once, never spent any atoms. Never really felt the need to, I've farmed over 10k atoms. But I bought the pint sized slasher bundle because I liked the outfit and it came with a weapon skin too. I snap bought F1st because of the dance emotes
---
Not trying to troll but most things in this game hardly work :/
---
I love the event and the rewards. I'm all about some new costumes.
---
I don't buy them montly, and while I've been playing since Beta, to be honest the first time I purchased was this year, one of the bundles with an outfit (not the Maxson one), and only because I really liked the Rider Power Armor, so I decided to get the Rider bundle.
---
Oh I do, but it moved! I tried to build next to Charleston. Built it at the end of the little road. Here, you can check out some of it http://imgur.com/a/DcSnAJH
---
Zero, and I've spent around 7k atoms in the shop.
---
If playstation is able to build chat transcription, which provides instant and clear text of what people say, who says it, to your phone. I fail to see why video game companies \*cannot\* do the same.
---
And if the new version works for them, then it’s valid. 
---
It’s like the Star Wars prequels and now the sequels. “This isn’t the Star Wars **I** grew up with!”
---
Fallout 3 wasn’t the Fallout I ‘grew up’ with either. And gt here were people saying it was going to ruin the franchise.  Same thing was said with varying frequency about New Vegas and 4. 
---
The experience evolves. Maybe you don’t like this ‘phase’, but others do. So the best option for you?
---
Skip this one, and play one of the old titles you like. Get some of the mods for new content. Wait and see if Fallout: New Orleans is more to your liking.
---
He just hacks, whacks, choppin that meat.
---
They may of still owned the rights to it and not the others
---
Paid $30 for the three bundles they had this year(Quakecon, E3).
---
The 1650 seems like a good deal, but the problem is that everything in the Atom Shop is way overpriced.
---
But do they have an option to use currency in australlia? Or is it just usd.
---
Still waiting on text chat, perk card loadouts, inventory improvements, and lots of bug fixes.
---
Hi. I don't know how well I do without Power Armor in this because I've been in it all the time since I was able to, but now.. my CAMP is using a double bass to get under the surface. I assume it's protected there from anything. But of course you have to get out of PA to get into it. But finding that workaround was so interesting, putting a double bass on a mat, and putting it on a staircase, then moving that just the right way to get it under the surface, then playing the instrument, and then you're under the surface and can build! Took a lot of time but so different. 
---
I like showing it to people when I can just because it's freaky. :) You can actually see when it's nuked, but from underneath. 
---
I managed to do one successful Mischief event, but even wearing a witch costume I don't see particularly interesting rewards. Golf club? One star Legendary from the sentry bot?
---
Ooh, another quality of life improvement Bethesda will ignore.
---
Toxicity
---
Technically your squad can win you a match while you're dead.
---
Is the Fasnacht mask you can pick up at the insane asylum a different thing that this one?  I've come across probably 3...  It's not always there, but it's there.
---
The game is in a really poor state on PC. Many people are using aimbot, all headshots. This game is broken beyond fixing. Many backdoors for cheat software, not to mention sloppy coding with TONS corner case situations doesn't help either.
---
Bye my guy.  
---
Won't miss you terribly much honestly.  
---
1) What were the patches for in the first place you numbskull?  
---
2) Cash grab, how?  
---
3)They deleted a post where you were being uncivil, you snowflake.  
---
4)That's your fault  
---
5) DLC has been free ever since they promised. bethesda never fucking said private worlds would be free.  
---
6) You'd waste more money trying to buy stock to sue a company because you're mad then you would by just not playing the game or being apart of the community.  
---
7) Almost literally impossible  
---
8) Ever since two dudes posted on reddit that the companies they work for allowed them to shill on multiple accounts on multiple medias, everyone wants to be a astroturf-gater
---
And I quote, "We are looking to make these articles (inside the vault) weekly."
---
They will probably roll it out once they figure out how to monetize it. Eventually they will do it if there's enough demand. We asked for more scrap, they said it affects performance and now here we are with fallout sub giving unlisted scrapbox. On ESO we asked for account wide stuff like undaunted skill line / skyshards unlocks after earning them and now they're selling the skill lines and the skill points in the store.
---
Worse ITV?  
---
What was the best one, and how do you judge a ITV?
---
David S. Pumpkins
---
I'm getting tired of people whining that Bethesda won't address something that they have no need to address, enough youtube videos on how the ITV didn't mention something that they are not required to mention.
---
I mean.. just because a bunch of reviewers dont like games, doesnt mean you wouldnt.. same with movies? just cause someone doesnt like a particular movie, and rates it terribly, you might enjoy it. i know i have absolutely loved some terribly reviewed games and movies.. sometimes its better to just make your own mind up about something, over just listening too and following the hype.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
You sound clinically insane.
---
0
---
Yeah, the toxic  avengers are just mad that bethesda didn't address Fallout first when they didn't have to.
---
Community managers....  
---
ARE BETHESDA HIRED  
---
OMG, how dull can you be?
---
I don't like to talk to people. Text chat should have been implemented since day 1. Also realm/server chat for people to be able to ask for help on missions.
---
This is basic shit Bethesda.
---
Mischief Night, new halloween costums and icons. Two new things, and I'm sure there's more.
---
if they squash bugs in a patch the new content whiners pop up if they do new content the squash bugs whiners pop up, if they make a pro pvp adjustment the anti pvpers get cranky if they make an anti pvper adjustment the pvpers get pissed. cant win with some portions of the player base without pissing off other portions.
---
I don't think bethesda is going to downfall just cause you didn't buy some CAMP decor.
---
No. PTS would be PUBLIC Test server
---
PUBLIC
---
&gt; Speaks volumes as to the kind of people on this subreddit.
---
FO76 since FO1st is like a Nigerian scam email. It's purposefully, obviously a complete scam that scares away anybody except the most gullible idiots quickly and easily separated from their money.
---
People are so quick to drop Bethesda like a potato.
---
Wow that plasma rifle is amazing.
---
Gotta get that quaterly money, heaven forbid investors might get upset.
---
I'd say the whales complaining about "angry raiders" are the insecure one
---
I haven't bought first and am not mad that it exists, I personally would only buy it for the snazzy ranger outfit.
---
I agree they should have different tiers, our group paid the same for Conan, then Ark through Nitrado. They had a phone app so if nobody was on I could turn the server off so our Dinosaurs wouldn't starve  and if a group member wanted to play they just texted me and I could turn the server on from my phone. Also had full adim rights. That would be a better idea for 1st players then the tent that, as mentioned before should be part of the pioneers scout quests and the stash box IMHO.
---
None of us are worried about stupid kids with nothing better to do- we literally have private servers.
---
They don't take the stuff you bought but they rotate things out of the market for the time being, making it kind of a hassle to pin down when you finally have the atoms.
---
We pay in AUD, but well above the exchange rate.
---
For example, First costs $180 a year here. 
---
We cannot buy in USD.
---
BWAAAHAHAHA yes!! Rip floopstown huzzah floopton. looks good I have considered building there myself in the past because of that boat. good on you mate it looks nice!.
---
That's every game every conceived.
---
Sometimes new content adds new bugs, Devs aren't robots, things slip through.
---
Any fanbase has the people you just can't fucking please and they will ruin 76 themselves by complaing every fucking time Bethesda sneezes the wrong way.
---
If you originally placed the cat &amp; globe when they were free, then you wouldn't be able to place them again unless you bought them.
---
What do you mean? Foreign TV commercials in the background were totally immersive.
---
buy everything camp related in the atom shop.. every single time haha
---
I get around 150-250. Highest damage with instigating handmade and adrenaline was 750
---
I am sure that A) Bethesda is not going to kill their own monetary shop, so Mods will be likely either creation club or BethNet (Since PS4 has 76, Xbox has 76, and PC has 76, CC is more likely)  
---
B) Worlds might become persistent, we may never know.  
---
C) I believe your CAMP is saved regardless of server, private worlds are just servers that are set up so you and friends of yours are the only possible players.  
---
D) I believe if a camp hits budget in a public server, that you'll have the ability to store it and rebuild it smaller.
---
&gt; Community managers....  
---
ARE BETHESDA HIRED 
---
Yeah, I know... smh
---
Yeah. I've also tried the let the *** fully restore it's  health and get better drops trick. Near as I can tell it doesn't do anything. I do allow legendaries to fully go through the glowing conversion process before shooting.
---
It's you again!  
---
The guy upset that PVP is in the game.  
---
No. They aren't going to make Workshops that go against what Workshops are supposed to be, a type of CTF/KOTH PVP you can do in-game.
---
There is a link in this thread.
---
Wrong. Flying enemies still spawn and scorched spawn too.  All camps spawn enemies relative to the region they are in.
---
Johnny guitar and big iron are two of my faves. I only hear the radio when I walk by one in the wasteland so I avoid song burnout that way. if a good one is playing near a mattress I will get out of my power armor and get my sleep buff while I listen lol. I also took a minute to sort inventory while listening to "I didnt know the gun was loaded" at the west big ben tunnell yesterday. getting concrete I was a tad low.
---

Yes, I know the Wastelanders expansion, thanks for the information, but I really like the power armor edition ... Don't judge me please, but the truth is that the offer is very good for me, (all I hope is that Wastelanders is free)
---
Thank you!
---
THis is actually a good post I would love to upvote and also:  
---
u/LadyDevann  
---
\*Cough\* \*Cough\*  This would be cool for the deaf and hearing impaired 76ers
---
I doubt that since they often come on here and post, CMs are frequenting several different places. Reddit is not the entire customerbase.
---
Write his name down and then throw it into the trash.
---
He keeps hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
---
I found the Power Armor Edition in $59.49, the normal price is $200 or $190
---
It would be harsher. There's a frame of reference of what the game use to be to directly compare how far Bethesda has fallen.
---
Open a ticket with bethesda net?
---
It's like a witch...thing. A witch...pursuit thing.
---
I often debate spending IRL dolalrs for Atoms, but 1650 atoms a month for 13$ a month is a deal. Or farm atoms via challenges.
---
Never been attacked once when I was there for a month. Not once. 
---
Have you lived there?
---
maybe make it cost 1 land mine, tape it to the lock and shoot. 1 per level of the lock 3 for a rank 3 lock as an example.
---
The BAttle Pass system, a subscription service.
---
Edgelord over here
---
Wastelanders will be free, yes.
---
What?
---
It's a 1 star.  Who cares
---
It shouldn’t be pinned because it only affects a small %  of the *non* playerbase.
---
HEY EVERYBODY HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS ABOUT A GUY NAMED BUTCHER PETE?!
---
Poisen damage received a major buff when vault raids were released. As for the other perks/armor not working or effects broken...its a crap shoot with every "update" Bugthesda releases. They consistently use older builds of the beta and release them as new "updates". Bugs/glitches that were fixed in lets say patch 10 are now back in patch 14. I know I have to constantly reload my weapon upon login and also my water and food drain crazy fast. I know there was a patch that actually fixed those 2 bugs but now are back.
---
depends on what they're selling. I spent 80 bucks in one month for the greenhouses, liberty prime, etc. but then I pass completely on other months. I am a subscriber now but the main value I get from subscribing its the scrap box and the survival camp. I hate sorting junk with a purple passion. do I need 2000 glass? no. do I miss pressing R holding left then pressing ok for 20 seperate scrap pile once every couple hours. not one fucking bit. I hated that shit. 2500 hours of sorting junk I no longer have to endure. to me the subscription is freedom from one of the most obnoxious aspects of the game. should it be free yes, do I care if they charge me a pittance for the luxury? nope do I care if other people approve? not a smidge.
---
Except that bethesda is doing literally TWO big singleplayer games after 76....  
---
SavePlayer1 still exists my dood.
---
I think I'll settle on Cavalier assassins. Seems to fit how I play.
---
The people in the game are great.
---
Not too happy with Bethesda at the moment though.
---
I know. That wasn't what I meant.
---
Battle Pass,  basically what you're talking about  
---
Or like Destiny 2 has, the Season thingy  
---
A free tier that comes with the game, a premium tier you can buy
---
In a way a battle pass is a subscription service. Once a season is over, if you want the premium rewards for the next season, you have to pay again
---
Yep.
---
You're right; I didn't understand what a shitshow that is. Wow.
---
but...liberty prime. totally worth it for the initiial 2 weeks of joy it brought me before I had to put him in storage. I still take my liberty armor out for a spin from time to time but as a daily wear it can be frustrating hearing liberty prime, plus a frind talking in his mic, plus some events voice relaying information.
---
2020 seems like Wastelanders and then maybe something around the new games or new DLC for 76, idk.
---
For real maybe Oscar the grouch or some raccoons will care
---
And a robot.
---
Anyone having trouble getting atoms must not ever do a challenge...
---
Old screen was much better.
---
At first glance this is a shitty comment. 
---
Split second after reading comment it's an accurate description of what Bethesda probably does with all the reports they have recieved over the past three months
---
You mean future non-playerbase.
---
That's consoles for ya.
---
That’s because the community became pretty insufferable.
---
What platform you on? It's spawning regularly on xbox.
---
However the reason they requested a refund is because it wasn't as advertised or otherwise had a "major fault", as per ACL that entitles them to a refund.
---
They are working as always on public server stability.
---
It's available until November 5th :) maybe try hopping servers?
---
I'd never heard of fallout 1st, yet here i am thanks to that article.
---
I think OP's problem is hilarious.
---
This seems like it'd make the lockpick skill useless.
---
Its definitely better overall, I'm on the first gen xbox aswell. It still has its moments were it lags but, definitely better.
---
Meh no matter what beth does someone will bitch at them. I think first was a good buy for me and I also think a portion of this community are such toxic whiners no matter what beth does it will never be good enough. I also think these toxic bitches will create alt accounts copy paste rants and do anything and everything to spite bethesda.
---
When have they ever added a paint as something outside the atom shop?
---
r/quityourbullshit

Those who haven’t left yet after F1st won’t find better reasons to leave soon enough.

No News is good news

I just did mischief night. Hope whatever is going on gets fixed for you, it's probably just some weird glitch.
---
every fallout has been different from each other 76 is dif from 4. 4 is dif from 3.  3 is completely dif from 2. 2 was a big change from one. 
---
when you say fallout is "the game you love" which version are you talking about? 
---
I loved the story arcs in 3 but I loved the settlement building in 4. 4 had less choice in storie arcs but 3 had no freeging settlements to build in and defend. 
---
76 is good in some ways but i find myself missing the permanance of fallout 4 settlement building. workshop scratches the itch a tad but haveing to redo everything every time you log is frustrating.
---
I mean. Even outer world doesn’t do it.
---
They didn't forget. They just lied.
---
I've tried to play it twice, both times I joined after it was already in progress. I still have no idea what to do in there.
---
Even if it takes level 5 demo to break locks, it's better than having to swap perception cards since you get a damage boost with it
---
It just works
---
thats a good spot too but i left there cause it was constantly taken and lots of lag, and nukes. but i built army tents around the old jeep and made it look like a lil army base. it is one of my favorite looking spots.
---
BREAK SHIT AND GET CANDY
---
Haha nice- I used the tires from the atom shop as walls and put turrets on them.
---
Jus place three big tires ontop of each other and blue print it- tire walls!
---
currently i just live at the monongah power plant in a little clearing by the road. nothing great to look at but its never taken and its close to my fusion core generator.
---
As a laser gat user I can understand why!
---
Best response ever.  :)
---
I think there was an issue with Dion and "The Wanderer". That's why that one in particular isn't in there, a Google search might shed more light on that one.
---
You sit at my table and hold my pocket when we walk , because the others will never accept you again. You're one of us now .
---
Yeah it had way to many actual RPG elements , not enough mine craft features and generic missions and terrible dialog
---
&gt;Judging by this sub's reaction to most things  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;this community seems to be especially critical. 
---
What reality do you even live in? This sub has, since the very beginning, been ***too tolerant and supportive*** of Bethesda *if anything*, with the mood only really changing the last few months and now the straw breaking the camels back. I was downvoted into oblivion several times for pointing out minor bugs ("Bethesda has more important things to fix and are making the game great! You'll see!") and minor critique that mirrored current sentiment but before it was cool. Just because you aren't salty at Bethesda doesn't mean you can warp reality to just make it so Bethesda are still doing their best and the dissatisfied customers are just meanie pantses. 
---
Nothing is more irritating than someone calling a customer 'critical' when the company is at fault.
---
From their ITV:  
---
"In addition to Fallout 1st, Mischief Night, and new Nuclear Winter rewards, Update 14 brought a variety of gameplay improvements, bug fixes, and more to Fallout 76. In case you missed anything on patch day, we’ve gathered a few of the highlights below. "
---
Dollarydoos is it. Or emus if ur rich af
---
Couldn’t agree more. My time and enjoyment of the game is worth far more than the price of a coffee a week!
---
You’re a fucking bitch, dude. Go see a therapist, you clearly need one based off of your comment. History. Spineless little fuck.
---
yes on the first and no on the second. I fit in the second category. 
---
but being in that category kind of puts you in the "they give less of a shit about your opinion" box. they sold you a game and you got it. play it or dont. (I dont)
---
You’re a spineless little fuck, lol. Real brave pouring on your keyboard. 
---
I don’t okay 76, never bought it, I just come to this place to laugh at suckers like you, but she’s a community manager, not a developer. Grow the fuck up and go to bed, you’ve got school tomorrow.
---
My sentiments exactly
---
This is a pretty unique idea and i love it. 
---
There is a couple of points to consider tho.
---
In the scenario that we have to “make” them so we can drop them, then we would be constantly needing to resupply them and noone would do it cuz what a hassle.
---
The other scenario is that if we have an unlimited supply and we can just assign one to always drop and play when picked up, it would become suuuch an annoyence if in a pvp scenario when bags are been picked over and over back and forth constantly replaying them.
---
The way it could be implemented is that maybe have a cool down timer where if someone picks your bag and the holo plays then in the next hour or maybe even game session, upon picking the same person your bag, it wont play no more.
---
That's still something you have to deploy and maintain. That still costs labor.
---
It's better than "Anything Goes"
---
I wish I could just listen to the background music on Rose's radio the whole time... she talks too much over it, but the music is so cheesy and calming.
---
Yes, via the social menu.
---
I love all Fallout, in its single player glory. I would buy 76 again if it came in a single player version.
---
Pc mostly I solo. I am level 363. all my original group of friends have long gone. the only time I get involved in pvp is when players try to gank me at my shop. I am pretty good at staying on the outskirts when defending from the npc mobs and not getting player killed. I keep an empty friend list now days because in the past I found out a "friend" was ratting me out to pvp gankers so they knew when I was on and had a way to get to my server. I dont really do parties any more because pvpers use that as a way to initiate pvp with you wther you want it or not. my social interaction is limited to showing up at big fights stim packing downed players and just being generally nice and helpful as long as it doesn't involve joining a team or adding to the friend list. I would get into pvp more but even when i was specced for it and making a legitimate effort it was usually just a one sided fight I always ended up losing. so fuck pvp the qol perks went on and stayed its easier just to avoid it entirely.
---
importantly, this ruling was before the announcement of FO1st, and given that it is such an obvious and dramatic change to the dynamics of the original product and the against the initial promises of the product, there is ground for requesting a refund as a result.
---
If you are an Australian citizen.
---
One day you'll stop defending this trash and we can share a beer.
---
Yes I paid $300AU for it and within a year they broke serveral promises like bringing in repair kits and fallout First
---
Yeh hence why I typed mmo 'style' and not MMO 'game'
---
Bethesda have already abandoned the fan base that won't continuously pay for half-arsed broken content.
---
Vampire Explosive shotgun would be great if your parked for shotguns. Combat shotgun you need quick fire rate and decent magazine size. 
---
I use vampires explosive and Furious or executioners mainly.
---
ya am sure Outer Worlds community would love to hear it,not. they hate Fallout i guess now yet they want to play a game that's like it. I just wanted to state I think the 76 community is better.
---
Its actually about Pete fucking women but I guess your right.
---
Yea, I just started back myself, had been so long since I played that I forgot how to, had to relearn all the key bindings and shit and what buttons to long press and PTT. I was probably gone for 6+ months. But I have had the same issues, the game will play fine then all the sudden start getting choppy and the only way I've found to fix it is quit the game and reload it. I also had a mission that told me to listen to a Halo tape and I did like 10 times and it never would say complete, finally I looked it up and it's been an issue for 8 months still not fixed. Ended up having to drop the tape, then spend caps to fast travel back to where I had originally found the tape. If they can't fix the smallest of things like this then why would I pay for private servers. Don't have any friends that play it anymore either. Like 20 people on the friend list. In the last week I been on not a single one of them has been on. This game was and still is a shitty, I like the idea of it and it there wasn't so many issues it would be great. And what's worse is I spent my money on it I feel as though I need to play it to get my money's worth.
---
Joe Daddy! HAHAHA
---
Anyone who still believes what Bethesda says are fools.
---
I stopped by this level 12 camp and gave him a couple double magazine comics I had, molotovs, grenades, whiskey and bubblegum...lol...its fun randomly giving
---
I mean, do rush it so you can finish quick and server hop to a 2nd one but don't *rush* it rush it.
---
The time frame is frankly bullshit, and meant to prevent people who feel fucked over by recent events from refunding.
---
Everyone is entitled to a refund for this game.
---
Well... Honestly I don't think Camp and settlement building would work in Outerworlds. The game isn't open world and is fairly limited in that sense.
---
I've come across 3, 1 of which was my own that have been removed for seemingly no reason? I've checked the rules several times and none of the posts violated the rules.
---
Ok fair point.
---
Read the directions it tells you what to do upper right corner.
---
It’s not gaming community’s man the game just sucks and isn’t what fallout fans wanted . Since the beginning
---
Todd Howard going door to door.
---
Pirate costumes??!! GARRRR!
---
Yarrrrr
---
Start menu, weapon and emote wheels do it too.
---
You got my full support mate!
---
Oh, they CAN add items to player inventories? Good to know that they just chose to do nothing all the times players reported the game bugging out in some way and eating their items...
---
They can get them a copy of outer worlds instead .
---
It's awful that they don't make games more accessible already. We should all be able to enjoy these games to their full potential. I definately think that this is a great idea!
---
It will be free, no way Bethesda would go back on that especially after fallout 1st
---
Its hard to believe but they do read this stuff even if they don't take it fully on board
---
Due to Bethesda's terrible decisions and multiple broken promises/lies
---
He was rather, combative, whenever people asked how it would make sense or that it wouldn't fit the theme of the game.
---
Right though? It's like the most vindictive little people downvote every comment regardless of content.
---
Here's one ran earlier with tse handmade [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlvdLOXhSAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlvdLOXhSAE)
---
It's good when quick hands procs but the reload ruins dps as rifleman. Around 300 a shot with tuned receiver even on level 100 bosses in paradise. I need to change to stinging until they fix the aa. It doesn't seem to matter on the handmade if you run drum or perforating, numbers the same.
---
With dragon doing, well I dunno really.. in the video over 2k but hard to read, use it to one shot the nuke drone. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tlf7NEvqeo&amp;t=29s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tlf7NEvqeo&amp;t=29s)
---
Mainly sneak for full health. If your running around, you might try the stealth glitch. I found if you exit pa crouched while under attack, your guy exits and is stealth but standing up. This let's you run around while still getting sneak bonuses. I dunno if they'll fix this.
---
Two shot is ok but only if both projectiles hit target. Ts takes a hit to accuracy. I personally wouldn't choose TS over bloodied. I would choose anti armor and junkie over TS
---
I turn that off its is very annoying.
---
Good find. Might help someone with that card.
---
&gt;feelsgoodman
---
I think the community has been pretty insufferable on a few fronts since Fallout 4.
---
If they did nothing in those cases that is very unfortunate for those that were affected. perhaps this is easier because it is just scrap and I imagine it will be a set amounts and types of scrap that all affected players will receive.  It seems like this is a step in the right direction. Of course for all I know they could just give five of each common scrap item to those that lost their scrap. For now I am glad that they are doing something but we will have to wait and see if what they do is meaningful or not. I just wanted to share this for those that may have lost scrap like I did. I really hope they do try to make it right.
---
Bug fixes? Hey, I'll have you know the entire team spent months replacing that bathroom lightbulb only for it to revert! Gamebreaking! Everything was put on hold so they can change it again.
---
/s
---
You have tried more than one controller in this time, right?
---
They wanted this to be an MMO-lite experience but they won't even give us basic text chat. Literally call of duty has universal text chat now..
---
Have fun with that plasma grenade plan, can’t remember what i got for it but it was a lot.
---
Not everyone was as thrilled as you to see settlement building. Me included. It's just personal opinion. I got over it some people didn't and they play outer worlds rn
---
I guess you are not into hacking and whacking.
---
I have done the event at least 6 times and the only reward I’ve got was the grim reaper cut out. I can’t blame Bethesda, but man it’s like flipping a coin and landing on heads each time
---
It could, depending on your luck, end up blowing up the contents inside. But it Is too much to ask from this game of us.
---
Monster Hunter World was developed for consoles then ported to PC and supports text chat. Hell, MH games developed for the *3DS* with no intention to ever have a PC version had text chat. There's not much excuse to not have it.
---
One of my characters Is suffering from it. Ps4.
---
I run a full set of vanguard's scout armor. Using all the available  damage reduction perks, I have over 500 DR and ER. 
---
It's a combination of armor and damage reduction perks and damage rating perks.
---
Which damage reduction perks do u use?
---
well by pvp justifications they are using an allowable in game mechanic to kill someone else who willingly signed up for pvp by claiming a shop. regardless of the fairness of the they fight when they take the shop they agree to pvp. 
---
by dropping a nuke on their camp you used an allowable ingame mechanic to potentially destroy someones base and kill them. they willing signed up for that possibility by signing up onto a public server and everyone knows if you sign up on a public server you are saying you accept the risk of being nuked. 
---
sooooooo WIN for DJ plane keep dropping those nukes sir. I actually manage to get one guys camp once after he got my workshop. guess he didnt check that map. lost a nuke generator, his anti radiation arch, all his vending machines the whole 9 yards. I am complete shit at pvp but I can go from 0 to targeting a nuke in less than ten minutes. and yes most times I just server hop because I dont care but if you catch me on the wrong day in the wrong mood be prepared to leave server or lose your shit. if you are so dedicated to pvp you dont run player vendors because you want to stay completely off the radar. you already lose becuse youre denying youself content and income. not to mention you will have to catch me in the exact 2 seconds i travel in and out of my shop to get items which means you will have to wait for 15 to 30 minutes like some desperate loser for the POTENTIAL chance of killing me. at which point you will pay 100 plus caps to contest my fully fortified camp - i will pop stealthboy and head for the border spammin super stims. even in best case scenerio you do manage to get me. your down 50 caps and I walk away thinking "man hes so dumb he cant comprehend just how fucking dumb he is." THEN after you take the shop several things may happen 
---
1. I stand near the edge in pacifist mode. I go make a sandwich. either you try to stay and guard the shop while I chew and laugh because I know what you really want is a good fight. Naw man Imma just hang out and marvel at your stupidity. 
---
2. I go around event hopping and I make money watching you "guard" my shop. if you were an idiot and failed to put a lock on my extractors as soon as I see your dot else where I will just  steal them from you. I once got 4 hours of resources from a moron I came out of stealth before fast traveling out so he could see me. and when I looked back from the new destination he was at the shop. Muhahahahah looooooo...s eeeeeer
---
3. if you have a vendor camp set up as previously mentioned if I am in a nuking mood you got 10 to 15 minutes. 
---
4. if I actually need the resources of the shop you have taken I will just go to private server now and farm what I need. the take away from this is. if you see me owning a shop in public now days it means I dont really "need" the resources which also means absolout best case scenerio you lose 70 caps over all and there's a good chance I am going to fuck with your time.
---
What are you playing on? My OG Xbox One crashes every event without fail. I've tried running it 10 times now.
---
Fuck I don't even have a single emu, I think I need to tighten my belt and get a go.
---
Barbarian and Ironclad add to your damage rating, Lone Wanderer reduces damage.
---
PvE : Full unyielding sentinel AP refresh. Either run unarmed with deathclaw gauntlet or a fixer. If I get into power armor it's 2 handed super sledge.
---
PvP : Assassins sentinel + random prefix. Use AAE weapons and it does quick work on mobs if I pve with it as well.
---
imo, tankiest build for PvE for me would be running power armor with AA weapons. But get emergency protocols, it's 50% damage reduction &lt;20% health. Helps keep you alive.
---
Technically, everyone *isn't* entitled for a refund.
---
If you own a store and you just have ppl that hang out there and not buy anything, do you care if they're in your store or not?
---
I don't like using power armor as it just eats up resources I dont want to farm for. I also dont have to worry about fusion cores and making or buying them. With this build Intanked 3 legendary SB the other day no problem whatsoever.
---
Any specific type enemy your having trouble with?
---
If they already paid to enter the store where everything inside was promised to be cosmetic or free. No. No I wouldn't have a problem. Because they already paid to enter my broken store.
---
He’s hacking and

One of several added random encounters with the Sheepsquatch add-on some time back. Other encounters include:
---
-A dead brahmin with mysterious quills sticking from its body accompanied by a Sheepsquatch call.
---
-a Sheepsquatch nest surrounded by dead brahmin, accompanied by a Sheepsquatch call.
---
-a Sheepsquatch sleeping in its best.
---
-a Sheepsquatch fighting an enemy or group of enemies.
---
I have that.
---
This!
---
And happy cake day.
---
allowable in game mechanic used to enable an unfair fight isn't greifing if you sign up for a shop you sign up for pvp. 
---
if you sign into a public server you are signing up for the chance to potentially be nuked. launching a nuke onto someones base is an allowable in game mechanic for enabling an unfair fight. 
---
naw man pvpers are dumb. dont start nothing wont be nothing.  leave people the fuck alone. pvpers are like those damn 7 day Adventist. no I don't want to join your stupid church I just want to get these fusion cores and be left the F alone. fine dont want to leave me the fuck alone I will drop a nuke on your house. it is that fucking simple. both are allowable ingame mechanics, both are agreed to terms of play. yes I consent to having my shop taken, well fucker ya logged into public so you consent to having your camp nuked.
---
I'm on PC, the only way to use mods atm. Maybe it's some console-related bug, I dunno.
---
Cool! Thx for letting me know.
---
Haha. Kinda felt sorry for him too I didn't hear the sheepsquatch though. These features are quite cool and scary.
---
You weren't supposed to have those in the first place. They were both atom shop items that were made freely available in error, then psyched back into the atom shop later.
---
I wouldn't write off every dollar you've spent to support them. I'm sure that through the years, you loved the Elder Scrolls games just as much as anybody else. And Fallout 3 was a pretty good continuation of the post-apocalyptic RPG; I was also thrilled that one of my favorite series, that I had written off as dead and gone, was being revived and that others could see how great it was. And that was absolutely true... at the time. Times change, though, and with them friends can become strangers. It never changes the friendship you had, but  you're not obligated to hold that friendship as a reason to continue supporting them when they go down a different path. I never thought I'd say "I'm going to wait on reviews before I commit to Elder Scrolls VI" and yet here we are. Bethesda is nothing like I imagined it would be, and I hate it. I hate what Bethesda has become, too. I hate that they aren't focusing on making great games with great stories and great characters; choosing instead to go whaling for maximum payout for minimum effort. It feels like (and in many ways is) a terrible betrayal. But I will never regret the hundreds of hours spent making horribly disruptive spells (and sparking an inter-faction civil war in the middle of Imperial City), bringing the sound of Three Dog to the Capitol Wasteland, watching Faendal trigger the same pressure plate in Bleak Falls Barrow (you know the one) over and over again, and many other moments I still consider dear to my heart.
---
Goodbye (for now) Bethesda, I hope the negative feedback from all these disasters wakes you from your stupor and you find your way back to the path we fell in love with. But I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for you. There are too many other great games I'm enjoying without you.
---
I've come across two of those encounters you've listed. I do quite like these features for the sheepsquatch.
---
Anything that melee attacks.
---
Are you expecting people to behave like decent rational human beeings in here? Might be asking for too much sadly.
---
launching nukes is an allowable mechanic built by design and you consent to potentially having your base nuked when you log into the public server. most people DONT because its considered griefing. just like when people take shops. most people DONT because they know the guy is most likely just trying to farm. so most people consider "pvpers" griefers.  so if you dont want to be nuked dont take a dudes shop. and if you do and he nukes you dont be a baby about it.
---
nah he wins. pvpers suck
---
nah pvpers are winning 1 sided fights that most pvers arent really equipped to do. pvp in this game is horrible executed and people that take advantage of it are just dumb.
---
Sounds like Blocker might be what you need. Once I starting using it, I wasn't so squishy against ghouls.
---
How many gears did you collect?
---
BOS PA paintjob from Forbidden Knowledge?
---
Nah, they’re just funny
---
Their mistake not putting as a “deaf *1st* player”
---
Did you hear the point going over your head or did that escape your notice too?
---
Even in power armor, I find myself more squishy to melee attacks than in previous games - Maybe wndrstrck will chime in here and say their setup works pretty well, but some of the faster, higher level ones seem to just churn me up no matter what. For me, that would be Assaultrons, some of the Gustys, Sheepsquatch, even Gulpers and Feral Ghouls if they catch you in a bad spot close quarters, etc. (Oddly though, scorchbeasts aren't an issue.)
---
I got your upvote man. you have to think about the demographic and the type people you're dealing with here.  most kids I have ran into in game have been cool so far, most girls have been cool, and seemingly everyone that sounds over 30 have been cool so far. so far every "pvper" I have heard on a mic has sounded like some 15 to 30 ish man child. they're full of teenage emotions and testorone or just bitter with life because they're now fat and get no respect because they are no longer the captain of the football team their hot cheerleader wife swoll up to 300 pounds. so instead of taking the normal human approach they go out in game expressively just to piss someone off because finally they can have a teeny smidge of power nd self respect.
---
This honestly makes me fucking angry. Bethesda was fine before it grew. Now some suit is in charge of the only multiplayer fallout game and has made it shit, and mislead their customers creating a bad name for the team that initially developed the game, and has been developing great games for years. Fuck business people for ruining good games.
---
I dont consider it griefing if someone else started it. I dont get your point.
---
I think people expected a AAA game when it’s not. Still a fun a RPG with meaningful roleplaying, choices and a purposeful story
---
The one time they didn’t lie ig
---
Blessed Samhain to you as well! This is something I keep bringing up on Twitter - it's so frustrating that this feature hasn't been implemented yet. I'm not dear but this is basic functionality that really should have been in the game from day one. I hope they fix this soon.
---
You want Johnny Guitar *back*????
---
that meat
---
It’s a good bit and I hope to see it more
---
aaah fatboy I called it ages ago my man. private servers now. next theres going to be pvp free public servers. told you man toxic 1% are gonna get edged completely out of the community. power has shifted greatly since our arguments back in the beta days. nobody likes pvpers, in fact beth is making a mint off the fact that people will pay just not to be around the pvp crowd. I think the pvp crowd should just git already. go on. this is not the game for pvp. pvpers all suck , even pvpers know they suck.just shitty people all around. to dumb to even comprehend that they're dumb! its like the least self aware type person I have ever seen!
---
that's something I've been complaining about
---
Misleading title. How nice.
---
The fact that this sub isn’t an outer worlds sub is shameful
---
It would be awesome if they offered multiplayer in a remastered Fallout 3, yes. 
---
I guess an Atom Store to buy stuff (and in game Atom challenges) would be an okay extra layer on the game, and it wouldn't affect the core Fallout 3 experience or the game itself -- same with 1st -- so yeah, sounds alright to me. Atom Challenges in Fallout 3 could be a neat extra.
---
if you cant afford this subscription you should be at work instead of being on this forum. I can be here because I am rich and can afford many frivolous things.if your sweating 13.00 a month it means your income sucks. if you  have the ability to argue with me on this forum you are able to be productive in another way. learn to invest. research usefull things instead of game stats. theres no excuse. if you're here and you are mad over 13 bucks a month you have the problem not the game company.
---
Before Fallout 1st: $10
---
Now: $8.33
---
And rightly so. Total gouging on regions outside the U.S.

You know what, I should have checked his comment history. My bad.
---
What level was the perpetrator, btw?
---
0.
---
Never bought any atoms only earned them in game and in the time I’ve played  I was able to buy two power armor paint sets and a lot of camp items and still have like 1500 atoms left.
---
You know the truly sad thing about it, they'll ignore feedback like this, look to sales numbers and make up some insincere PR piece about how they're responding to community feedback while full well knowing that they're ignoring feedback like this.
---
I wish I could say that this is just speculation but they have precedence for it. Twice.
---
Yeah but its still better to voice our opinion than to keep silent imo.
---
It just works!
---
Bless your soul. I feel them coming...
---
I didn't contact them unfortunately but this Aussie says fuck yeah ACCC, the ACCC is what made Valve have to start giving refunds on Steam.
---
Absolutely agree. Just understand that unless it directly affects their bottom line, it won't make any difference. Logical arguments and public shaming seems to not be effective in the slightest.
---
It’s safe now but they haven’t returned the junk they owe to those of us who lost it all. If any new bugs arise and you lose something, you won’t get it back.
---
Do.... do you hear something?
---
Yeah and the worst thing is, the developers might already hate the whole model the game is taking by now, but their hands are tied by executives eho dont care about the community in the slightest.
---
Shhhh. They can hear you...
---
I would personally wait after wastelanders release, as it might cause some critical bugs, which will take some time to fix.
---
Not trying to be negative, but realistic.
---
Cheers :)
---
Oh I feel so sorry for you. 
---
You have no idea what Wastelanders will be like and you're going to pay upfront in the hopes that you'll enjoy a DLC that none of us know much about?
---
If you wouldn't mind some solicited advice, wait until Wastelanders launches before spending any money. You'll know for certain by then whether or not it was worth spending the money.
---
Although if you are sure you will play alot even before wastelanders, I'd buy.
---
I'm not Fallout 1st member myself, still considering.
---
I wouldn't trust Bethesda to translate things accurately at all.
---
You: "Hey man, how you doing"
---
Bethesda buggy translation "Say Dan, why you mooing"
---
Not just that. Bethesda have a very clear history of restoring bugs that they've previously fixed with pretty much every patch.
---
With this past history, how could you have any faith that the scrap deletion bug isn't going to return?
---
Melee builds are very good
---
I have 1 month sub and have not had any real issues like in the adventure mode. Smoother game play but I do notice some lag when dealing with vendor bots and my stash box.
---
You sure this is a problem with the game? Any other have this issue? I’ve been playing on Xbox one since beta as well and nothing audio related is broken for me.
---
Eatin good tonight boys
---
Fleshy meat sounda
---
Those will come...
---
...to F1st
---
I subbed immediately, I have had 0 issues with scrap. I logged in and instantly cleared up my inventory in my normal stash of all junk.
---
I don't see a misleading. What was he supposed to do? Write an essay on the title? It says that Zenimax mislead the Australian costumers. Just that, which is true. On what did they mislead the Australians? Reading the article you find out that that they mislead the costumers when they said that they couldn't get a refund for the game. You want all the info in a title?
---
Thanks for your advice. Sounds fair after all flaws, bugs and mehh content so far. Something just drags me back to fo76 time and time again 
---
What i know is that i struggle with stash space already and would love a private server. What i hope is that wastelanders brings new items and stuff to explore. 
---
So the extra's count for me pre DLC and hopefully even more post.
---
Atoms are also IRL money.
---
Except if you farm them of course.
---
Wait until after Wastelanders.
---
It's controlled by a terminal and speakers... so no ghosts
---
You can farm them easily.
---
Mmm guess thats the big??? For me now... maybe just enjoy the time that scrap is wweightless with the risk of having to scavenge all of it again
---
They probably realise that there are players like you that'll do the right thing and waste those resources. Why the hell should they play the support role? I'm sure that's what they're thinking. 
---
Same deal with the Free Range quest. Screw protecting the herd when you can decimate all the monsters ensure that you don't miss the opportunity to secure those legendaries.
---
Bethesda has a terrible incentive structure in place for these sorts of quests. There's very little to motivate people to work as a team, so why expect anything less?
---
What a surprise it was removed s/
---
Have you done the main mission for it yet?
---
Legit think they are just stupid and don’t know, and another part of me thinks not enough tanky builds turn up to activate them.
---
You sound like it's a lesser problem. People wanted refunds because the game didn't deliver what was promised. So, Australians demanded refunds which were rejected by Zenimax. The Australian govt interfered and demanded Zenimax to refunds the "first wave" of consumers who bought the game. I don't see much of a difference, honestly.
---
Agreed, a chat system would be great
---
I’d look at what ESO has. My guess is it’ll eventually be the same.  https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/store/product/eso_plus
---
This makes sense.  I just happened upon a battle between 6 Super Mutants, A Giant Hermit Crab and a \*\* Scorchbeast. Watched everything in stealth then picked off the Scorchbeast for the last 10% or so.  Went to eliminate the super mutants can the scorch beast vanished. :(  could be anywhere and in the swamp everything looks like a downed scorchbeast. oh well.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. Bought the subscription when the it was down. I opened up a ticket and they told me the purchase isn't finished yet and it can take about 24 - 72 hours to be finished. They have charged my CC right after I bought it.
---
Then you already know what to do.
---
&gt; For example, First costs $180 a year here. 
---
Including 10% GST
---
So Bethesda get 163 AUD, which is 112.59 USD, 12% "above the exchange rate".
---
Australians bought the game, didn't match expectations, wanted refunds. Zenimax denied refunds. AUS govt demanded Zenimax to refund the costumers because that's how Australian consumer law works. Pretty simple. And fair. I'd hope more countries had the same law.
---
Actually it isn't.  It's because of the bugs.
---
If you want those op one shot shotguns, find a Blooded Explosive one, but it's going to cost a lot and people don't sell it for caps usually.
---
Besides the shotgun damage perks, you should use Nerd rage and keep your health below 20%, use Demolition Expert if you have space for it, and Enforcer for crippling.
---
I think it was something along the lines of, if you use the launcher, even once. You cant refund it"
---
So some fine print bs that no one knew about until after they had played the beta.
---
Nope, what counts as a trick in London is shoving lut fireworks through peoples letterboxes...
---
Dude your taste is really bad.
---
JOHNNY GUITAR? HELL NO!
---
Are you on PC?
---
People don't know how to think rationally anymore. They only react to things.
---
Based on events over the last year since launch, they’re not actually ignoring feedback - they’re taking it all in and figuring how to monetise what we tell them.
---
Are you stealthboy tesla type of pvp'er? If not then add me RaidasB. I love PvP
---
Actually under Australian Consumer Law when it is a major failure (a reasonable consumer would not have bought the product if they knew of the issue) then it is the consumers choice if they get a refund, repair or replacement
---
Like I feel like there's a couple of legs to stand on and atm I'm ready to test it. An action by the ACCC wouldn't cost me anything either 
---
The retailer can’t refuse to help you by sending you to the manufacturer or importer.
---
You can claim a remedy directly from the manufacturer or importer if the goods do not meet one or more of the following consumer guarantees:
---
acceptable quality
---
matching description
---
any extra promises made about such things like performance, condition and quality
---
repairs and spare parts - the manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that spare parts and repair facilities (a place that can fix the consumer’s goods) are available for a reasonable time after purchase unless you were told otherwise. How long is ‘reasonable’ will depend on the type of product.
---
You are only entitled to recover costs from a manufacturer or importer, which include an amount for reduction in the product’s value and in some cases compensation for damages or loss.
---
Or just give him my ign Vault_dweller+
---
He's going to add you, thanks 😊👍
---
How about strangler with explosive gatling :D
---
And crops! That would make the purchase truly worth the atoms spent.
---
GW2, pay for skill templates!
---
I'm ok with that :)
---
I would certainly not be opposed. I don’t think xp needs to be connected since essentially it’s a new character as weapons etc wouldn’t transfer.
---
Beyond that I agree. We need a difficult mode.
---
Anything pvp related is a bad idea in this game. You have no idea what cheaters can do. It also doesn't help Bethesda has no interest in banning any of those cheaters
---
Yup
---
That's like complaining that a beaten wife cries too much.
---
I'm a BE laser rifle pvper. I absolutely love sniper battles in hills at long range where half the battle is just trying to spot your target before you get spotted because it's an almost guaranteed kill if either of us lands a shot.
---
I personally don't like the idea of being "tanky". Snipers aren't tanks, I'm a glass cannon that only wins by being fast and accurate.
---
My most recent fight was against a guy in strangler and a be gatling plasma and he literally never hit me with a single shot before I melted him into oblivion.
---
I love being a bloody build that's an inch from death but you better pray you shoot me before I shoot you. I haven't seen another bloody pvper in a long time, it seems like full health builds are "meta" now but I continually show them the overwhelming power of a BE legacy at 19% health.
---
Imagine someone doing berserker's low health build
---
You were right
---
Whoa whoa whoa, dont you start flyibg attacks at my home boy butcher pete.  
---
  
---
Also im guessing the reason for other songs not being used is like when the wanderer was used for FO4 and Dion kicked off about it, a lot of artists are very hippy type people who dont want to be associated with nuclear apocalypse
---
Pretend you're in Portland, OR. Then do what the handful of weirdos there do during protests.
---
Frankly it only would’ve taken another word or two.  It was a clickbait title.  It implied they misled customers on FO76 as a whole when it only applied to refunds.  
---
“Zenimax most likely misled customers on FO76 refunds” is hardly an essay and far more accurate.
---
For sure dude I love fallout and enjoy difficult gameplay and the vanilla mode is just not exciting enough for me
---
Hey mate, I have a question because it sounds like your a subscriber. In your opinion, do you find it sort of annoying that 1650 is just below the cost of stuff like PA paint? It’s a common thing to do with these sort of things, give people just a bit less than what they need so they end up purchasing points to fill the gap to 2000. I’m not trying to be rude, I just want the opinion from someone who purchased 1st.
---
I don't think so. But they need to find a way to monetize their game without triggering sore losers out there
---
If your doing The Black lodge Hunt and maybe you get to Hunt a radstage there Will be a mark on your map where they are this many but this has actually happend to me and a pact of radstage were fighting a yao guai
---
Wastelanders will be available for all. They have always said that. F1st was going to be released “alongside” of that dlc, not behind its pay wall.
---
I’m deaf and the subtitles in the game, to put it bluntly, suck. Thanks for making this post- you’re not alone!
---
Why do you people want to make the robot even less cosmetic than he already is? He is already useless and people still throw a hissy fit calling him P2W lol. Maybe they could right there wrong and create a separate robo earned in game that does this. I think this actually would go a huge way in pacing the hate from angry Redditers.
---
I didn't pick this fight. I made a comment, stating my opinion on people who are wasting their money on a game it has taken nearly a year to fix, you responded in a smug and completely misjudged way.
---
I have 9700 and didn’t buy any of them.
---
They already had a way, its called the $60 price tag to play it in the first place.
---
I do apologise. I hadn’t played in a while. You’re right.
---
It requires an active 1st subscription.
---
Most games still dont have those, as most games were still made at a time you would get full value for a one time purchase. Free to play games have outfits for sell, pay to play just some, sadly more and more?
---
They’re heeeeeerrre
---
I bought Fallout 1st on the first day and have had 0 problems. I have yet to use a private server, but for me, the monthly 1650 Atoms and the survival tent (with scrap box) is worth the yearly rate.
---
Alternatively, introduce Fallout 4-style settlers with the Wastelanders DLC. Hire some help to tend to your crops, brahmin, water purifiers and resource collectors. But you'll have to provide them with food, water and a bed or else they'll get disgruntled and leave. (It's probably not going to happen, but one can dream.)
---
Of course they did. Anybody really expected something else?
---
Bloodied weapon damage goes up in distinct 5% missing health chunks, all the way down to 5% health. You get nerd rage at 20% health exactly and your bloody weapon will go up in damage at 19%, 14%, 9%, and the last bit of damage is at 4%.
---
The common ways to run a bloody build is at 39% health as a "safer" build. At 19% for nerd rage, or at 4% if you are an absolute madman.
---
The mutation "adrenal reaction" works the same way, it kicks in at 49% health.
---
Which is excessive considering it costs them no extra for the content to be available here.
---
You're welcome to think otherwise but there's not justification for any difference beyond a few percent.
---
Im on xb1 s and im lucky ive only crashed on like 20% of the events ive done so far
---
Fallout 1st have changed so much, that we are now pleading Bethesda to put stuff in the atom store
---
Isn’t the ranger outfit right now just an oufit? You can’t mod a regular piece of clothing
---
How in the hell are you supposed to implement paid dlc in this game?
---
Honestly 0
---
Destiny is F2P and you have to pay for expansions. No thanks.
---
What type of pvper doesn't use chameleon? One piece of chameleon and an automatic weapon is entry level pvp equipment.
---
Good idea hadn’t though of that!
---
Don’t count on the server wide announcement popping up just check WS on the turn of the hour
---
I like this idea, though I do have a question. What would be on the holotape?
---
Ya I would say he is a few frys short Iof a happy meal.
---
Same way any other MMO does it and the same way fallout has done it in the past.  Instance the DLC content to different map about a quarter the size of the original one, and have it set to where thise without the DLC simply dont have access to it.  
---
Bethesda could also save a TON of money by allowing true private (3rd party hosted) servers to be a thing.
---
Maintained and updated? Bethesda brought a lot of studios to develop the game. After the initial 60$ pricetag i would be surprise if more then 2-3 employees work at the game for constant fixes and updates.
---
Yeah cheaters does definitely hurt pvp a lot I play on Xbox so I don’t deal with it really
---
Find a mirror then you will see who is whining. I didn't seek you out and start asking you questions.
---
My melee character runs a full set of zealots trapper armor with +1str and "Harder to Detect While Sneaking" and the radiation backpack. I use all the stealth perks including the card "covert ops" because it stacks with "ninja" on unarmed weapons (except the meat hook) so I get 3.5x sneak attacks. Add on lv3 ghoulish so rads heal me and I'm an immortal being. 
---
I'm basically unstoppable. The only thing in the game that kills me easily is the imposter sheepsquatch if I'm not careful enough.
---
But the SBQ? I eat her for breakfast. And the entire cranberry bog zone. Bring on every scorched in the game, I can handle them, that is, if they even detect me before they get power fisted ;)
---
Next month in Fallout 1st: Personal Robo-Water Haulers
---
I am both tired AND a mobile user. Mwahahahahaha
---
wtf is this event all about apart from cars exploding and hitting a few ghouls? The bot at the end was so swarmed in players i could even see it let alone shoot it. Shite event...
---
Something must have been fixed. Played six or seven events tonight without crashing. Actually got a few shots in at the end to get some legendary items.
---
 Nope- you are just on a sub about a game you don’t even play anymore whining.
---
Still commenting?
---
It’s been crashing a lot for me as well- the only way I’ve been able to do it is on a private sever with 1-2 friends helping. Sadly I don’t have the skills to solo it
---
Oh you need the last word bud? Ok go ahead have it- wouldn’t want you to lose any sleep over this.
---
There is 2 upcoming variants and 2 skins coming to fo1st members on the atom shop. it's all exlusive to fo1st, sad enough
---
The event was so fun but yeah it crashed waaaaaaaayyy to much.
---
No, it won't don't be foolish
---
Use a vampire big gun like a laser Gatling. I sometimes take all three pylons on and it helps a lot
---
Same, though I remember my own post on this topic a while back and all the little shills telling me “just get a mic” because clearly, that solves *everything* when it comes to communication in this game.
---
I got it a few days after the stash thing and have loved it so far. No other players have bugged me like reported on the sub. 90 percent of the camps I visit in the public have the stash box in them showing me they are fallout first subscribers.
---
They can’t leave, as it says in the ruling it only effects people from October to June which has been and gone.
---
No issues yet, but I haven't beem able run many of them
---
In hindsight, the game should probably have never been released for the standard Xbox One.
---
Put my automatic vampire combat rifle to good use to this recently. Grabbed a pylon then just kept to the edge of the fight shooting at the lesser robots to keep my health up.
---
That’s because you use pal and your a long way away from mother England.
---
When the event starts, ft to the resort, not where the event starts. Let everything load in properly.  Walk to the cottages behind, take out the ghouls there and wait for the event to come to you. When the event moves closer to you, you will join it. From there head to the courtyard and do the simple shit slowly. (get candy, fork the lawn) As long as you dont hit a robot you can essentially stand still through the mayhem. Move forward after the fire is lit, tag the legendary and then wait once again for everything to cool down.   
---
Sucks that you cant actually participate, but at least you wont crash out.
---
😂 I would like that too but I don’t think we would get enough support from the community on that lol
---
You’ll buy it if it’s not
---
That place is a pool of madness lately. You can always find that herd fighting some insect or 1 yao guai. But i once got there for a  bear horde event and there were like 40 animals fighting.stags,stingwings,bears...it was chaos.
---
I think it has to do with the hunting daily in that region.
---
I am subscribed and I crash 90 percent of the time
---
That may be because many quests are abnoxiously hard to complete and or are bugged. Daily or weekly challenges atoms are a small part of available atoms, the big part is not renewable.
---
good lord the game is ugly
---
16 times the details
---
It's worth noting that this doesn't remove the damage buff though.
---
If you do the dailies, excluding the ones like complete z while wearing y and using x, you get around 400atoms a week and from the weeklies around 150, so 550 atoms a week. I would say it’s not bad
---
You're probably right, I've not had one crash on the X and I've done it maybe 20 times now
---
They will only fix the paid servers. Those free servers will always crash
---
I know, but public by itself does not necessarily imply free, at least in how the company interprets it. They could say it is still open to everyone after paying for the subscription, it is not invite-only, and does not require signing an NDA.
---
It would be such a different experience, I’d actually go over there :) and it would be easy to implement
---
Problem is they wanted us to function as replacements for npc’s. They stated before beta that “every human is a player” because they wanted us to be immersed as our own vault dweller, and a text chat is really immersion breaking.
---
That said, I agree. Since they’ve given up on the “all humans are players” thing with wastelanders coming up, they should bite the bullet and put in text chat.
---
Unfortunately, nothing in the code is designed for this. There’s a mod that does it with.. I think it’s a flash plugin? Point being, I can’t see them writing an entirely new subroutine for this. Unless they could charge for it, of course.
---
Must be a console problem.  On PS4 I’ve crashed (blue screen) way too many times during this event.
---
I have a mic, but if i had chat i would have used that more. There is something about the value to the social aspect of it. 
---
Yes, chat can be used to troll and grief. But for the most its fun and effective. Trolls and griefers can be blocked.
---
Good luck.stay strong. I can't even sell mine'cause nobody has what i want.
---
Wait... Seriously. Does it remove the negative effects so say I get the addictions and get all the negativity effects plus damage boost. Each time I take a chem the negative effects are gone but the buff stays.
---
You're asking people to play rationally and as a team.  Have you been on this Reddit long?  That's clearly not the majority's strength.
---
Nah, I never do floating camps, I can't stand the sight of em haha
---
I'm mainly spending my time crashing and reloading back in hopefully with enough time left to get a reward.
---
it might be if the storage, tent, armor, private lobbies, and atoms were a one-time purchase instead of a subscription.  The the storage specifically is something that should have been part of the game from day 1.  Such a hard limit on storage space was a bad idea then and its a bad idea now.  Charging people a monthly fee for it is proof that the whole "we're not sure if the servers can handle the strain of all that storage" was a complete lie.
---
And so far they have kept every promise they have made... are you on their payroll by any chance???
---
I can see it being rolled out earlier to 1st subs
---
Just pay for a 1 month and try it , why wait
---
Good to know, good job.
---
This is what i plan to do once we persistent servers and the tools to mod them. I really cant wait. Its what i wanted out of this game since it was announced. Seems like the only logical way to go for pvp in this game.
---
I instantly thought it was about game development promises, cosmetic only etc
---
Well not the best news but afterall they said ranger armour is exclusive.
---
Getting one month isn't a big deal tbh, if you really want that outfit.
---
One time purchase would then cost several hundred dollars, even more if demand is low. Are you okay with that? Isn't that the ultimate pay to win?
---
You cant. Thry are different every day. Theres no path
---
Madness...sheer madness.
---
Chances are there is nothing new to communicate right now, and there might not be for a long time. It has already been confirmed that all upcoming content has been delayed to 2020, there will probably be nothing noteworthy for the rest of 2019, other than minor patches, and at best a return of old seasonal events like Fasnacht and Meat Week. And I doubt the company has any intention to change the monetization plans, they know it worked with ESO Plus, and there is too much potential revenue to just abandon it or make major subscription features free. I would expect more or less a repeat of what happened in the time period between November 2018 and March 2019. Lots of outrage, no new content, then it begins to turn around in February or so once detailed information about 2020 content is finally revealed.
---
That's a shame. I was kinda hoping for a route at least.
---
I’m not here for the insults. I’m only staying facts. F1st was going to be released “alongside” of Wastelanders. You can find this leak on Juicehead’s YouTube page and others. Furthermore, historically speaking, none of the dlc for fallout 76 have been behind a pay wall. If an when that happens, you’re insults will be warranted.
---
Yeah juicehead covered this to
---
Good thing is, this kinda fucked over some dupers that tried to store near million pounds of junks
---
Sorry for your loss. I hope something cool finds its way to you soon. As a suggestion, message the camp owner and let them know you’re interested; some people will take the “first come first serve” mentality, and others may pull the weapon out to sell it direct as long as you are offering what they would have gotten anyway or their asking price flat if you just need to sell a couple things. No guarantees, but I’ve found this community to be pretty awesome about stuff like that.
---
Ditto, I’d get two servers if this ends up being possible haha
---
Trick or treat......perfect time for it,like the jo ho's "do you have a minute to talk about pip boy".....
---
Hahahaaa fuck this shit is sad
---
Prices don't go up when demand is low, thats literally the opposite of how the concept of supply and demand works.  You might have a few whales that pick it up (like the ones who have already purchased a year's subscription) but the minnows wouldn't touch it.  They'd have to make the package more attractive and drop the price with a heavy emphasis on the latter.
---
&gt; They will only fix the paid servers.
---
They wont even be able to fix those
---
Yea that’s the point. That’s not what this is about.
---
It’s almost like they chose to do this for First players. It’s pay 2 win AND you get actual customer service? Holy shit.
---
&gt;An AAE fixer for 10k
---
At least for steam, people could set up a US account and family share the fuck out of it. 
---
But steam's regional pricing means the games are often cheaper outside the US.
---
Well said
---
Did you try subscribing to Fallout 1st?
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, but this is a not a feature that needs demand. It's a basic necessity.
---
That event works fine on my friends private world when there was just two of us.
---
The Battered Wife Syndrome. 
---
It’s like Bethesda read up on Psychology of the human mind and ways to manipulate it and went “this is big gamer move right here”
---
I would love this type of mode. Since NW came out, I've been (very unpopularly) suggesting that Survival should be a hybrid of both modes. I like NW not relying on legendaries, or armor builds.
---
As an aside, it would actually make crafting, and those of us who have unlocked all mods, relevant.
---
That is not what this ruling is about at all
---
Companies aren't your friends.
---
Ok, but let's be clear about the amounts.  I've seen people claiming the price difference is near double, comparing 99,99 USD with 180 AUD and so on.  13% is not 100%.  It's not even 80%.
---
You and me both. I always figured it was the stealth/tesla tryhards, that were benefiting from the broken status quo.
---
It’s not a hidden subscription. It’s not a mandatory subscription. It’s an additional service you can buy or not buy lol. This entire decision by the Australian courts is about zenimax’s representation of rights related to refunds. It has nothing to do with advertising lol
---
Right. Weve been asking for a server chat from the beginning and all they give out is broken events.
---
Im on xbox, personally i just gave up. Ive tred maybe soemwhere between 15-20 times to do this event and only had it actually finsih without crashing twice.
---
Wow! Good job
---
Dropping the price is not an option as it will do nothing but hurt their sales. If you're just asking for a cheaper lifetime fallout 1st, I really doubt any management at Bethesda or Zenimax will consider it seriously. Even if they did, they will just have to come up with a new premium subscription model like Fallout 2nd or 3rd to reach their sales goals
---
Nice! How close to center of Nuke ring do you need to be for ground zero to count? That’s my last one.
---
No
---
I keep forgetting to finish off my Achievements because I get so distracted by my Possum badges and Daily/Weekly challenges. I’m sure they’ll eventually even out!
---
This is what I do when I know this there's more than 12 / 13 people at the event because I know it's going to be super laggy. If there's less I'll start with everyone else and I'm okay.
---
I've done the event about eight times now and I have not crashed once. Not sure if it's internet speed related also but I've had pretty good luck.
---
I dont know i stood on the nuclear mark before it struck down and i died but got the trophy
---
Good luck
---
Thanks
---
Wait where do I get candy
---
I play on the PS4 pro and it crashes atleast 3 times a day for me within a span of a couple hours. And the event is a 50/50 I'll blue screen crash. It's not optimized at all and the fps is utter garbage lol. I wish I started this game on PC tbh, it actually looks decent on PC. 
---
But consoles are a complete write off. They struggle heavy on this game.
---
I agree though, there needs to be some serious optimizations for this game because it's extremely frustrating dropping fps all the time and blue screen crashing.
---
 Mean while there's other triple a games that look 100 times better and play at a steady frame rate on PS4. 
---
Fingers crossed we get some optimization soon ( if possible from Bethesda ) and a big " if " .
---
My main is a stealth commando too, he only has 2 END. But whenever there's someone doing encryptid I always put first aid rank 3 and blocker rank 3. Pop Med-X and medicine bobblehead (if I have one). 
---
I keep myself stealthed all the time and always try to take all 3 pylons if no one else taking them. I tag the boss with some bullets and then I'm just sitting on top of the roof the whole time. In the end of the fight I usually use around 10-15 stimpaks total. First Aid rank 3 is a must if you wanna take 2-3 pylons
---
Im not asking for a cheaper fallout 1st, im asking for bethesda to abandon 1st entirely for a less asinine revenue source.
---
Funny thing is it's actually about a dude with a really big one who goes around shagging everyone's wives.
---
Yeah I know right? It's like how r/StarWars isn't r/StarTrek. Shameful.
---
butcher Pete and his long sharp knife....
---
Naa, I think it's more of an atmosphere thing. The music is area specific.
---
I’m sorry your having issues op.
---
But I’ve got 20hrs in the last week alone and I’ve had one crash and that was during a heavy amount of server hopping looking for a gun. Maybe I’m just lucky but it also could be an issue on your end.
---
Hmm. Someone nukes whitespring the other day and I got as close as I could to the center (damn hotel was in the way). I got killed and my screen went white when nuke came down and I didn’t get the achievement.
---
If you're sticking with shotguns get yourself an instigating combat, that's what I use, headshots kill most lvl 68 super mutants and most lvl 62 charred ghouls in one shot. Only issue is accuracy, sometimes I've got to fire a couple of shots before they hit.  Cavalier armour helps as well as you're mostly running to get close to your target.
---
The dailies now give legendary scrip as well. I just enable them all in the pip boy, and plot a course. Use travel agent for low cost travels, a lot of fetching going on.
---
I so wish I could, but I dont remember their name and as the servers were so busy last night, it's lost amongst the bumble of other names. Given that their camp placement was in a popular spot (south side of Whitesprings) too, I can't even use that to try and narrow it down.
---
Is Butcher Pete meant to be a sexual song or am I reading into something that isn't there?
---
I thought so! I didn't know if I was just reading it wrong lol
---
You mean smaller and unprofitable revenue source that no one will care to purchase since it doesn't give you any benefits
---
You have to at exact spot the nuke lands ie the nuclear marker on the radar map at the bottom of your screen. You will die so don’t have any junk on you when doing it.
---
It's a great event to eat people to.
---
Perfect analogy! Another instance where a sub dedicated to an inferior piece of media should just switch to the superior one XD
---
That logic would work great, except the servers are the same. All the "private" one is is a separate instance.
---
I have a sneaky suspicion that the "test servers" will be 1st only, and guess what the first "test" will be.
---
Fallout? It's a codename for Restart.
---
&gt; Yesterdays ITV made it clear alongside some leaks that BGS is observing and waiting for the fo1st thing to blow over
---
Anyone got a link for this?
---
I understand. I just though the idea of being forced to repair something that's conceptually broken, rather than something that is literally missing pieces, was kind of funny.
---
That’s a steal most likely someone already bought it
---
Yeah, just for future reference. I had similar circumstances before and I learned to shoot a message as quick as I could if I wanted something bad enough.
---
Ive done it on both worlds. Zero issue on the private one during that event. Zero stuffer and didn't disconnect not once. Just saying it worked alot better
---
Why you gotta call them whiners though?
---
I see some complaints about this, and many others saying they've never had these many issues. I know my friends that connect via wifi or have a shower internet connection tend to have more connectivity issues (go figure). The less reliabke your internet, the harder it is for your console to keep track of your surroundings, the higher your latency is, and the more you will crash. Also, turn off auto update, especially if you have an older console/slower connection.
---
Ohhh! Almost forgot the big one. Even with ATT Uverse, and hard wired internet, I started having issues when I first played the game. It was after I got into trading on the communities pretty heavily, and my friends list expanded quickly. The more people on your friends list, the more your game will struggle. I found the magic number to be about 20. If you have more than 20 friends on your list, then it's time to go through and purge the ones you don't actually play with. The game forces an update of your friends list every few seconds, and if the list is too long it can cause lag spikes and disconnects.
---
Let the Purge begin!
---
Go off king
---
Wait, how did you do the trophies that are bugged like Queen of the hunt?
---
That’s what I was getting it , it’s a ridiculously good price.
---
Technically, and unfortunately
---
Ok, but I'm not those people.
---
Exactly
---
I did the event every day like last month coz my camp was at watoga
---
Only because it was instanced. The servers are the same as the public ones, and in some cases the instance itself is on the same server as other players.
---
The wood armor for chameleon mutation I can't live without. Love stealth combat. Sneak up and #BOOM
---
I did it at fissure prime and scorched earth started so i kept my junk
---
Yup. Addictions do fade on their own with time though, so just make sure to pop one if each class of drug every so often.
---
I mean , it did happen more than once and no one could've done anything about it
---
Could've been playing Sinjid 4 by now
---
Fuck business people
---
Lol you nerds that respond this to everyone dissing the game are the same nerds who defend heavy monetization expanding the game’s life
---
"you bought weapons on TF2? Sorry dude no refunds"
---
The only platform that would get "first access" is PC. They are the test subjects for new releases.
---
Inventory improvements are already here! You just need to buy Fallout 1st!
---
Then all the "instances" in the public world are garbage because they do work better in the private world. Now I haven't paid for a private world but play on my friends when they are on
---
No they don’t. You keep your addictions forever or until your use addictol
---
I got Monster Mash but Queen of the Hunt I haven't got
---
You may as well uninstall now because that's never going to happen. They will add MORE to the sub before they take anything away.
---
4 times the monetization of Fallout 4
---
You seem to make this same comment a lot and it’s always downvoted- when do you notice you are simply being annoying to the rest of us who still enjoy this game? 
---
Did you need to be told?
---
I've been waiting to try this build out. Been saving my junkies for awhile.
---
If I see something in a vendor, and need to get caps, or double check if I need the piece or whatever, then I open the map and quickly take a pic of camp and GT on phone, because been disconnected so many freakin times...
---
The $60 base game never covers DLC. Even in Fallout 4, NV, and Skyrim.
---
You just have me amazing Animaniacs memories
---
I did.
---
This guy's opinion means absolute bupkiss and he just doesn't realize it yet. 
---
Look at any of the YouTube streams of this game, and pay close attention to their friend's list. The success of FO first speaks for itself.
---
No, the perks of it should not be made free to everyone. That would take away from it's appeal, and make it harder for them to keep DLCs free. They have yet to go back on their word therex and for the foreseeable future, due largely to the success of 1st, they won't have to.
---
They are a business first and foremost, and businesses are there to make money. Not cater to entitled shitheads like this guy.
---
I don't think they're at West Tec... I do know you can find 20+ of them in Sugar Grove.
---
This guy is right. Let's go suck Todd together, friend!
---
I just wish these people who leave the game would leave the sub- this is a gaming sub about fallout 76. Enough whining from people who don’t even play the damn game. It’s just annoying.
---
However opening safes would be more fun.
---
No, I said they were found to be mendacious tortfeasers, viz. they lied about a protection guaranteed to Australian consumers I turn breaking the law. I am, as stated elsewhere, trying to achieve a similar end in regards to their mendacious marketing pre-release, rather than their anticonsumer practices subsequent to release. The fact that my claim falls under the same Australian Consumer Law as this successful action is comforting. That is all.
---
No, they couldn't have because they promised DLC would be free.
---
They TRIED to avoid a subscription via the atom shop, but all of you "loyal fanboys" just farmed the free atoms instead of buying them. You want to blame someone for the subscription? Take a good hard look in the mirror. So much for "speaking with your wallet".
---
I've always said that Berserker is at least on par in terms of risk than Bloodied, but the benefits are much, much lower. It makes no sense.
---
Too bad that the team isn't interested in balancing, only in finding new ways to make whales pay.
---
I totally agree.
---
Yeah I've seen this so much and thought the same.
---
It's rng mate. I personally never crashed the event but I've seen so many other avatars just stop and fade. One of my friends has a crash almost every time.
---
No, you don't. They fade on their own with time. I tested Junkie weapons extensively, to see if they were better than bloodied. They are not.
---
And here's another hint for future reference: if you can't afford an offered item in a machine, **always** take a screenshot of the listing that also gives you the camp owner's name. I always do this when I spot items friends of mine *might* be searching for, but I can't be sure.
---
For test purposes...
---
Actual "ready to play" rollout I can see there being an early access
---
I mean they never really explained the meaning behind calling it "first" have they?
---
The private ones only work better because you're not having to load and keep track of the actions of other players.
---
As many other players**
---
You spent more money after recognizing the first time didn't work? Lol. 
---
Contact your console's support or Bethesda support.
---
Definitely good advice and something I'll start doing. Alas I just didn't think straight last night. Live and learn!
---
You are reading waaaaay too much into this. Calm down, and stay off the deep web. It's making you a conspiracy theorist.
---
I've played since day 1 and have only spent $10 on Atoms. That was just for the Battlecoat. I farm challenges for the rest of my Atoms and have all I need.
---
However I'll buy FO1st when there's enough new content to justify the cost. I'm hoping Wastelanders will provide this.
---
It would still suck
---
Actually, you did. You shot the first salvo. You made the first attack of character. You’re the one who took an aggressive stance. 
---
Own your shit in the future. We’re done.
---
*told consumers that they were not entitled to a refund after they had experienced a variety of faults with the Fallout 76 game, including, in some cases, problems with the servers, lagging, graphic and visual problems*
---
I think the title is apropos, if a little clicky. It's more than just the time frame, it's also for failure to deliver a working product. That's a pretty common thread here.
---
Yes the crashes are annoying. But I continue to play because I really like this game. Ever since trying out Fallout 3 on PS3, I fell in Love with this game. I play because I want to. It’s just disappointing that at this stage of the game, that things like this still happen.
---
I don't really care why it works just happy I don't disconnect. Best money my friend has ever spent on me lol
---
One of my characters is junkies build never lost a single addiction
---
What about 
---
'Zenimax gives refunds for failure to deliver correctly working product' 
---
which is really the part that twirls my moustache
---
I wouldn’t give them anymore ideas in good faith :/
---
I don’t know if there’s a subreddit on CAMP builds but seriously there should be. I’d start one if I knew what the hell I was doing but I don’t :)
---
Wouldn’t want one as I find the game enjoyable and full of future content. Can’t wait for wastelanders dlc, which is free.
---
At least someone gets it! 🙂
---
I'm level 330, so all the easy stuff went a long time ago but I've still earned over 3500 in less than 2 months from daily and weeklies. Not even done all of them.
---
It's entirely possible.
---
If they tend to mimic the ESO formula (which they initiated with their F1st crap, and I don't see why they now wouldn't follow it up all the way), DLC should work on the same base: either you buy the DLC or you have access to it while you have the F1st subscription. 
---
Perhaps they won't dare try it on wastelanders (because they already said it would be free, though at this point, it wouldn't even surprise me if they went back on their word), but it will probably be done for future dlc sized content.
---
I think thats the crux of the issue. Public events draw in.....the public. On private servers theres up to what 8? Less people are less connections are less lag. Public servers its like a public swimming pool on a 100 degree day.
---
Because that's what they are, if they wanted a refund, shouldn't wait until now.
---
That’s the common one that’s been around since launch. There was a Fasnacht event where masks were given as awards and five of them were very regular, several others appeared just a few times across all of the game’s players, and a few more were seen on robots and in data files but never appeared - like this empty pumpkin rack.
---
Totally understand
---
The carry weight back pack has the ability to give you negative resistance, does this effect berserkers?
---
How many friends do you have on your list?
---
I don’t think you’d want him on your team. He just stands around and does nothing. While drinking coffee. 🤷‍♂️
---
The comparison mainly comes from the fact that Fallout was once a revered and praised RPG series, mainly thanks to Obsidians work with New Vegas, which was famously screwed with by Bethesda. 76 is a Bethesda abomination of what Fallout once was, taking away everything that Fallout was loved for. Now Obsidian comes out with a new RPG that’s really good. So the the two get compared based on those factors.
---
&gt; It's too much because a power armor skin costs more than the entire Far Harbor DLC for FO4. 
---
Irrelevant, that price is set to make them the most money possible. It could be $1000 and still be legitimate because that price tag would have been set by the company using data telling them they can make the most money possible by selling it at $1000. What I mean by that statement is that by selling it at $900 or $78 or $2 or $12000 would all make them **LESS money** than the $1000 price point.
---
&gt; That's an astonishing lack of value. 
---
I absolutely agree.
---
&gt; they should be making more money overall. 
---
That's simply not how it works. Prices are set so that the *most* people spend the *most* money. This is where people stop thinking about economics for some reason lol. If it's so simple for so many people on reddit to say "oh, why don't they just make it cheaper and sell more he he I'd buy it" why hasn't it occurred to you that perhaps **Bethesda has already considered that??** Prices are set to make the most money possible.
---
Picked up two fixers in the last two weeks one blooded perfect for me its changed my game completely and the other one not quiet what you were looking for but its available http://imgur.com/a/XH4d1bH
---
Handy tip for dolly sods daily. I've started saving all stingwing barbs, tick blood sacs, bloodbug proboscis and bloatfly glands.  You only then need radroach meat which you can get from the locked room where you activate the quest.  I keep them in my vendor for 25k so nobody buys and I can't accidentally scrap them.  Makes grinding for the possum badges really easy
---
I think it would be neat to start with a level 50 character build, more weapon and ammo drops, but lose all on death ofc then re-roll your character. That would make it semi-balanced so higher levels aren’t stomping noobs through perks.
---
I wouldn't even care about these sub-par outfits if they were for free. F4: New Vegas will absolutely stomp these into the ground.
---
Power armor.
---
This. Vampires plasma galtling plus blocker means i can usually grab a couple of pylons and still facetank the imposter sheepsquatch.
---
Thats just like, your opinion man.
---
No, he’s a cannibal serial killer

---
You can check the ITV here. But as many said, it's a lazy copy paste of previous ITVs.
---
Yes, very blatant innuendo for sure!
---
You want to see the game succeed, but don't want to have to contribute to it. Life doesn't work that way. $60 doesn't even pay for half a day of work for one person. MAYBE if loyal fans such as yourself had actually regularly purchased Atoms this move wouldn't have been necessary, but no one was really buying them on any sort of regular basis, so here we are. It's a necessity to keep the game running and to keep DLCs free. Unlimited crafting storage and private instances aren't game winning features.
---
Because public shaming doesn't generate revenue.
---
Because that’s what they are. Fallout 1st doesn’t hurt anyone, no one is required to get it and the funds from said service pays for the development of all the future new content which we get access for free. So when you complain about something that has no negative effect on you, that earns the title of whiner.
---
ITV’s finna start lookin like “the game will continue to exist. That is all”
---
You can pick up the halloween lootbag from the atom store, drop a mine, and then completely cover it with the lootbag.  Best i can come up with, though.
---
A couple orbital strikes and watch the fun
---
I am all against first, but this is really a conspiracy. It's easy to change the database entries for components, while on the other hand to produce each unique item for the use requires item tracking, which evidently they don't have and a lot of time to restore everything.
---
Sure they got some flaws, just don't get it then.
---
Probably should have included /s. Oh well I ain't mad.
---
I would really like to get the riot gear but even for one month subscription to fallout 1s is $22 in Australia. It's more than I paid for the game and being on PlayStation I already need to have a monthly subscription.
---
I really hate how they changed it from anyone can take it to only you can. IMO there’s enough supply drop holo tapes to go around
---
Nah, it’s to get panicked whales to spend money on the stuff that’s “leaving”
---
just because it is in the user agreement, doesn't make it legal. not saying that is the case, but it has happened in the past with other cases.
---
No doubt wastelands will come out a broken mess, so why not asking for more money before the last shred of hope disappears.
---
Yeah, I'm aware of the context, but 
---
As a Legion character, who's to say you can't do both!
---
On my third time I finally figured out the candy.  It is such chaos I don't really find it fun.
---
EULA are not enforceable by law
---
Yeah true. Good point.
---
I am getting people requesting my main weapons **all** the time as well, and as others have written, if people offer to trade, I expect them to offer something good, but that rarely ever happens.
---
I see three possible solutions to this:
---
1. Allow us to mark items as &lt;never show&gt; or &lt;available for trade&gt;, and make all items default to &lt;never show&gt;, so the other player doesn't have to scroll through my long inventory lists of apparel or aid items to find the interesting stuff. Would also help with performance issues during trades.
---
2. Offer basic atom shop paints for **all** the weapon and armor types, no exceptions, and for very little caps.
---
3. At least give us the option to reject a request, with various answer options alike to rejecting offers: [not for sale], [I'm close to max caps], [you can't afford this]. This can't be difficult to implement, as the same mechanism is already in place for rejecting offers.
---
Could not agree more dude especially with that last statement. Fallout 4 survival mode made players utilize every element in of the game in order to excel. Crafting buffs from plants, farming ragstag for the carry weight buff, building settlements to regroup and rest since fast travel and quick saves were unavailable. A survival mode in 76 could not only make crafting relevant but player interactions would be more meaningful. If the debuff mechanics were similar to fo4 survival then trading with a player in order to get a disease cure or water would be needed. They could give you bonus xp for trading with players similar to killing other players depending on the value of the item. This would give people a choice on whether to be good or evil and more greatly impact other players positively and negatively.  Area chat could be used to negotiate before a fighting another player. Sorry to rant I just like to daydream about these things 😂
---
Same man. The Last 5 Times I did it, the Game crashed 4 times and the other time I Just didn't get any rewards , Like I didn't attend the Event at all...
---
Man that suuuuucks!  I'm on PS4. Never had that happen. The event is super fun!
---
Wouldn't give Bethesda another penny for this game when I've already spent over 70 all together
---
Ridiculous
---
I wanted a fallout online experience. I don't wanna that ammount of bugs, but that's what bethesda is, a buggy mess. You cant talk about all gaming community. There are many people stilll playing fallout 76. Its still selling.
---
Have no problems on my One X or my One S, so strange that you have :/
---
Done the event 20 times across both boxes...
---
People are trying, but the lag de-synchs the server, so the pylons don’t activate simultaneously.  This is a software problem, most people are experienced and want to help and be successful.
---
Sanity check: do you think it is more likely that zero of forty players are making any effort, or that Bethesda’s implementation is weak?
---
You should factor in the prices of the items, that reduced the value of amount of atoms you get. Its not bad by f2p standards.
---
they did, just for 1st members it seems by the support tickets i think.
---
Damn dude, relax. Sort this sub by highest rated of all time and you'll see complaint after complaint. I never defended Bethesda for their bugs and missed promises either. I'm just saying this is a hyper critical sub and you coming out of the woodwork to personally attack me for my statement reinforces that.
---
Usually if I see somethings on xbox, I'll help test things out.. but I do not wanna test this. Unlikely, but it may be worth waiting 24 hours to see if theres some sort of updating delays or anything like that. You can also submit a ticket to Bethesda or microsoft. Both very bad choices, but if they really did take your money and give you nothing then it needs to be voiced. I would definitely start with Bethesda on that.
---
I've always gotten my atoms instantly. I'd contact customer support with your bank account transactions ready.
---
I thought they did if you priced it the same?
---
What kind of thinking is that? If a game sucks ass you shouldn’t need to pay ANYTHING to make it better?!
---
Nice leap...
---
Honestly what the holy fuck is wrong with some of you people?
---
I wonder if wastelanders would be considered a significant enough upgrade to necessitate compliance with accessibility laws
---
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-accessibility-requirements-in-33893/
---
Presuming that’s true, then you wouldn’t be a normal person OR part of the problem. 
---
If you switch to a regular/tagging weapon for the sentry, then it’s all good
---
Platinum trophy? Now that just sounds awesome. Never before have my "achievements" felt so inferior.
---
This happened to me just 30 minutes ago it does show in my purchase history but are not added to the game.
---
I believe the Halloween vendors play something else.
---
I would love the white springs music to play. lol
---
Same here. I'm going to make my next alt a junkies combat medic with high charisma because a pill popping healer sounds hilarious (and not that all unrealistic) to me.
---
The question is, can it be considered a "promise" in the legal sense that there will not be an option to buy something?
---
Lol you must be young.
---
I really sorry to deflate your point but your spelling of consumer really bugged me
---
Fallout.com
---
I have roughly a 50/50 success rate with it. All of yesterday I avoided it because the crashes are all way too annoying. I'd like the rewards, but it just frustrates me at this point. Which is crazy, because looking through this it seems I'm on the better end as far as not crashing goes
---
I never knew they weren't supposed to be free. As I stated in my comment I took a break from the game, so never realised.
---
I love bullet Shield- love love love it
---
where was the misleading? was there an advertising campaign exclusive to Australia that was misleading?
---
Exactly. The worst kind of hypocrites. Rules for thee, not for me.
---
Xo1 Milirary Paint
---
Graham would be in heaven. That’s not meat week, that’s meat MONTH.
---
Ugh. Ok so whitespring is a bad idea the.  Will try next time someone nukes prime.
---
Super mutant bones also count towards the challenge
---
Using big words doesn’t change what you wrote in deleted post
---
Yeah Fallout 76 definitely lacks in this area we need more creepy places like a dunwitch building like area
---
What platform? Only ps4 has a trophy for getting all trophys. Heheh
---
This is a good tip if the event can spawn!
---
On ps4 it has improved a lot to me.
---
I bought the game somewhere near April, it was laggy and shit, bought an Xbox One X because why not, saw on videos the game was even more unstable at this time. And one day, they patched the game and since then it run smoothly on PS4 to me. I had a non stop blue screen in NW before meat week but now everything is fine.
---
Xbox. We do have an achievement for that. But no fancy platinum talk. It's the same as all the rest
---
Don't forget Emergency Protocols if you're also a bloodied Power Armor player! We do exist!
---
Oh thats not really nice of them
---
I like all of those suggestions.
---
Lol yep, pretty much this.
---
Good [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UjAEOjdsg) that goes into detail about this very thing.
---
great news. A sign in the right direction and that those companys can be hold accountable.
---
 Not normally, especially for subscriptions
---
The only time I ever tried to buy atoms, which was back in the summer, I couldn't get the transaction to complete. I'm on PC.
---
Nope
---
I have a mic too. But I often don't want to use it, at least partially because I don't want to wake up my family if I'm gaming while they're sleeping. People responding to anyone wanting text chat with "get a mic" are assholes, imo.
---
Fancy Lads don't, but sugar bombs do.
---
what’s wrong with throwing grenades at the Queen 😳
---
The devs for MHW actually give a shit about their game though.
---
Worste case scenario, they will put it on f1st earlier like a week or so.
---
Yeah I had this happen the one time I tried dropping plans from the event. I do like others are suggesting now and drop something else first to create the bag and then transfer everything . Works fine doing it like that
---
Do you periodically take the drugs you're addicted to?
---
I prefer the term " unpaid spokesman "
---
Its character challenges I think
---
With a max of 8 people. It's definitely easier for servers to track 8 people than it is to track 24 or whatever the max is on public.
---
I wish I was paid!
---
It causes her to jump to a different spot or take off again.  Plus you're really not even doing damage given her explosive resist.  Easy queen - wait for her to land, no grenades/missiles/mini nukes/etc, and don't hide in the bunker or stand on the fence.  She will land quicker and down in be down 1-2 minutes if there's enough firepower, maybe even less time!
---
Big Rigs*
---
It was only misleading on the ability of customers to get a refund.
---
Have you tried replacing your component/hdmi cables? Are you using some off brand TV? Do you run your audio through a home theater audio system?
---
That is a very strange bug that I've never heard of before. Definitely not a "known issue". I'd check the rest of your setup first.
---
I would enjoy this!
---
If I was them I wouldn’t say shit anymore either. Anything they say is construed as some indelible promise.  Then people misinterpret what they even say. Then a portion of them make a rant on Reddit or Youtube and off to the races we go with yet another flame war over a video game. Rinse and repeat.
---
Reset game and go back in
---
HOHOHO
---
HEEHEEHEE
---
HAHAHA
---
People not chipping in?  Say it ain’t so!  
---
If you don’t want to help within an event then I make you part of the event (PvP).
---
Dion didn't realise Fallout was a game about violence apparently.
---
Glad you are enjoying the private world experience. I paid for a month subscription specifically for the private world. I have always played solo and never liked the fact others could intrude on my game. I dont use the private world to farm then go back to adventure mode, I have just stayed on my private world with no intention of ever going back to adventure mode so for me it is great however I do not agree with having to pay to play alone and I was really torn as to whether to get the subscription for reasons that have been stated in other posts but my hand is forced if I want to play the latest fallout game the way I want to play it. I never bother anyone and the only time I did try to help a lower level they constantly ran away so I gave up. I love the fact that when I go to a location the loot, scrap, junk and enemies will be there waiting for me. I dont have to waste precious game time server hopping for eternity just to get some lead for ammo. I'm looking forward to the wastelander update so I can play at my own pace and not be interrupted by others and I also dont want to get in other peoples way when they play.
---
The thing is that gets me is that they said there would be a subscription for the private servers.  Or if nothing else, they stated they didn't know how the private servers were going to work, and were clear about that.
---
THERE WAS NEVER A MAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
---
i can give you a private server too 
---
Owl_No is my psn 
---
im just lvl 51 tho
---
part of the issue is bloody meta, nobody that is bloody will generally take a pylon because it is almost an instant death sentence. Instead, they wait so they can hardcore dps the boss...
---
This is totally incorrect. my main is a junkies and my addictions have heald strong for months and months. They used to fade upon death but they changed that.
---
Are you able to use the audible perks like pannapictagraphist? I haven’t found a way even with captioning on.
---
Never going to happen, if you want it you have to pay
---
Im doing around 2500 per shot to the head with an automatic bloodied faster fire handmade. One hits nearly everything, can do a scorched beast in about 10-15 bullet in VATS. Bloodied commando build with all the perks and mutations
---
Bunch of reasons. One of them alone might not be a good reason to do it. All of them aggregated makes it a must.
---
1: Bethesda must suffer. Anything that inconveniences them is at least worth giving a try. They deserve it. This makes supporting the shit company by wasting your money on them less appealing. So that's good.
---
2: Punish stupidity. If someone is stupid enough to throw away $100 for basically nothing but a badge on a broken game they already paid $60 for, they're basically a genetic dead end. Hurting them is helping the human race.
---
3: Expose Bethesda's lies. If Fallout 1st players actually have access to private servers, it should be impossible to grief them. The fact that it can be done exposes them and that's hilarious.
---
4: It's fun. That's it. These people are playing a shooter game. If they don't like getting shot by other people, they can go waste money on Fallout 4.
---
Duh. It's still a spit in the face from Beth, but 76 would finally be an actual game with Wastelanders.
---
The place I went for most of the bones I needed was the Wendigo Cave.  There are a ton of the bone chimes hanging up, and a ton of bones on the ground.  I had already killed a bunch of super mutants before so already had a few, but the Wendigo Cave finished it off for me.
---
Nah they spooked you all sufficiently with Fallout First.
---
Sad but true, didn’t Bethesda say at one point they aren’t going to charge for add-ons???
---
Yeah ghouls, assaultrons, gulpers, yao guai and mirelurk kings take me out. I have to jump on something so they cant reach me and then shoot.
---
I just don't bother with them, same goes for the silo codes... of I find one; awesome. My fiance is full hearing so he has heard the noise a few times. Apparently where we had our camp at one point a code piece spawned nearby.
---
Corporate scum
---
These are all good ideas.  I also think they should have "clutter" packs that you can place in your camp.  Things like a table setting, desk setting, etc that allow the space to look more realistic.  I like how in FO4 and even Skyrim you can decorate with everything in the game.  I realize that isn't feasible here but I think if the Dev's create a bunch of small clutter pieces that are considered "camp objects" it would be a lot of fun designing.
---
One other thing I would like to see is the ability to have a pre-built house.  Just select it in the build menu and drop it in a location.  Then all people would have to do is decorate the inside.  I think this would really help with lag issues.  Give us a bunch of different building designs that are pre-built like warehouses, red rocket stations, small residential houses, garages, etc.
---
Just a side not but Bethesda really needs to discover ways of creating content similar to player vending and building.  The vending machines were probably the best piece of content we have gotten in FO76.  It basically added a whole new game play loop by allowing players to set up shops and stores.  scavenging -----&gt;sorting-------&gt;selling------&gt;profit.  I have spent more time in game messing with my shop and farming legendaries and junk than I have playing quests.  These are the types of activities players need in this game.
---
Good post. Have and upvote sir
---
There are few that I've taken photomode pics, and still value them as loading screens. I have now more cameras because it's easier to find, but I don't have them on all chars I play. Usually I like using the photomode so I can often zoom out and up to get as wide shot as possible and, and also to pose myself little bit on side of the picture.
---
If I would see the camp owner I would at least give them a thumbs up.
---
It's called DEAR hearts and gentle people, for Pete's sake.
---
Oh, uh, my bad on the phrasing
---
  Junkie's for PvP    
---
Why would you roll junkies for PvP? You can easily hit the 110 damage cap without being a junkies build. Not that is isn't viable, but I would say anything without any debuffs would be more meta.
---
did pre-ordering give you something extra?
---
btw pre-ordering is paying for a game that aint finished yet, and since fo76 got released as a giant bug, and also made pay2win...
---
u got done fucked up gud
---
Wow, even the same number of monthly in-game currency. They definitely based First on this as a starting point.
---
There's little bowls outside some of the doors along the cottages and also a couple in the courtyard.  They bowls look like the ones you can get in the Atomic Shop (has a hand rising up out of it).
---
Yeah that place is bugged.
---
You have gotten hours (I will assume many) of enjoyment- that’s why you bought the game? I’ve been supporting fallout since fallout one... should I get free stuff? No, I do not share the same entitled attitude you have. 
---
I have gotten many many hours of enjoyment- that’s what I paid for.
---
With fallout first I paid for a stash, a private sever, atoms and a tent. And that’s what I got.
---
So if you buy month to month, do you lose whatever is in the scrap box between the end of one month and the start of the next? Can you stack 1 month subscriptions if you don’t want a year?
---
Well, they did make junkies viable, so I think there is a fragment of hope
---
   
---
a desperate tactic of raising money after selling nothing
---
Yet here you are so distraught over the purchase of Halloween decorations in a game... and you honestly expect someone to take you seriously... if you took anything seriously you’d realize it’s a game and your own decisions that you made, all while no one forcing you to do it and you’re now complaining in an open forum about your choices.
---
If you want to talk about “IQ” you may want to evaluate your own here after you recover from your trauma and not so upset...lol
---
I've frozen a couple times on Xbox, but the majority of the time I've been able to complete the event with minimal issue.  My biggest problem has actually been a slight lag while trying to light the bonfires, but I can deal with that.
---
you sound like a spacers choice employee
---
Is she on pc?
---
There's actually a text chat mod, but you can only chat with other users that also have the mod installed. 
---
If you both installed, you could atleast chat between each other (and anyone else with it installed).

---
Anyone who made a Bloodied commando build without stealth or who charged into that situation without stealth should be killed for stupidity.
---
This.
---
Yeah its so stupid. Course I'm not selling an absolute god roll I've shaped my build around. Stop asking for it.
---
Anywho, my explanation for why the aa ffr is better is because uny sent doesnt provide the sustainability that ass sent has. Ffr is also currently meta in pvp to put it a lot of shots to basically bypass the damage cap, while explosive is good, it can be easily countered by dense fireproof.
---
People have been asking for a text chat since release sadly :-( if you're on PC there's a text-chat mod... I haven't used it myself so can't tell you much about it:

We all misled by zeni/beth
---
LUCKYYYY
---
Let's just say it happened, as it does. Who then?
---
Mate idk where you are from but our newspapers and magazines are shite. Literally a week ago our newspapers censored THEMSELVES in defence of media censorship. Does that relate directly yo game news? Probably not. But it shows how little aussies should and do trust our print media. So I and many other aussies turn to reddit for news for sure. It's easier to see replies and opinions of our peers and downvoted propaganda etc. It's a great source of local news!!
---
What about Cavalier assassins?
---
When you made the purchase did it say 1st was included? No... so then why would you get it for free? 
---
If they did offer it would in your opinion be ok with everything or just take it and still have your complaints? 
---
This is an optional purchase and not required for anyone to make. It does not make you a better player and you win nothing.
---
Good luck!
---
I haven't had it spawn for me and I was told it was bugged 
---
Can you go through how to get it?
---
I understand why your frustrated but if there’s a vacuum of good ideas in the current storm it will make it harder for them to make the right steps forward.
---
Fireproof/dense negates explosive dmg, AP drain is a concern for cavaliers to maintain the mitigation effects.  Bloodied does much more base dmg than than the AA, but at the disadvantage of lower health. With tank killer, the advantages of AA is lessened some. 
---
The bloodied player's low health is probably te biggest factor against the BE build. I would give the advantage to the AA FFR, as they also have a 1-5 point perk advantage over the BE build, that could be used for dmg mitigation perks instead of demo expert.
---
 Ultimately, it really comes down to the skill of each player, if one can't free fire, and solely relies on VATS, they lose, regardless of build.
---
How does it run? Broken sentinel armors and all the defense perks? Get killed a lot?
---
After doing some testing I've learned that cav is basically only good in melee builds
---
Also good Braxton medical supply has everything in one place which is nice.
---
How can you view this screen? (Console)
---
Could I buy that from you or trade a other event plan for it?
---
Demanding an apology from the internet. This gon be gud.
---
I'd think it would be great in large fights. Running and gunning, well I mean if you use tesla it would be.
---
Speaking of Lying op- maybe you should read past the title of the article. Just saying.
---
The survivability is great, the damage output could really use some love. As it stands I get much better defense and almost the same damage mitigation on my bloodied build, but, I can do 10x or more damage consistently.
---
Maybe they'll actually do something. Myself and other hearing impaired people have posted about this in the past, and Bethesda seems to not care.
---
lol that's not the reason, please don't spread misinformation. The issue was in return policy. Bethesda said "no refunds" and the Australian government said "Aussies can always get a refund here"
---
Theres ways to make the the build more viable. Takes some thinking and some work to do it though. I run a berserkers, its a lot of fun
---
- you can wear armor, it just has to be broken. You still benefit from the legendaries on the armor. I run a full set of bolstering sentinel wood armor. I chose wood because of the bonus to sneak and sneak speed. Playing a Berserker's,  stealth is your best option for survival.
---
- you can wear a raider under armor for those sweet sweet special buffs. In order to do this you need to het addicted to med-x to negate the DR you get from the sheilded lining, also youll need a high capacity backpack to negate the energy resistance.
---
- i highly recommend wearing bolstering armor. That way when your stealth is broken and start taking damage, your more capable of tanking any incoming damage. Along with literally every damage avoidance perk card, youll hardly ever die. 
---
- carry 1 or 2 good Vampire's weapons, once you start taking damage, and the bolstering armor starts increasing your DR/ER. Your Berserker's weapons will essentially become useless, switch to your vampire weapon to regen your health until you can become hidden again. Once hidden, switch to your Berserker's weapons again and start dropping bodies.
---
- super stims are your best friend. Coupled with born survivor, its very useful. 
---
All this being said, Berserker's is in a decent place damage wise, but i hardily agree that it could use a small buff. Maybe increase it to 60% or 70%. Hope this helps people out with perfecting their Berserker's build.
---
So, a bunch of butthurt salty boyz demanded refunds for a game they purchased, and probably played hundreds of hours?
---
What's the apology for again?
---
Log out of your xbox profile and log back in
---
 I beleive this is what i was told to do when knhad this issue a while back.
---
Yeah, pretty much. Funny we have to qualify that to avoid being called a shill though.
---
Should assassins armor/weapons suddenly be totally useless?
---
It's not going to drive new players, it will more likely stop some people from being interested in the first place.
---
Probably why it was going to be tied to Wastelanders, to give new people a reason to overlook the change.
---
In reality, it's a ploy to get new money out of existing players, with the hope that it brings in more monthly revenue than it will lose from people leaving over it. You could guess that it's partly because they weren't getting enough sales from the atom shop, but I think that unless the atom shop was wildly successful, it was going to go in anyway.
---
The business reason behind it is likely to show a more steady stream of income, which would make the business look better than the current model does, with huge revenue spikes on releases, followed by smaller ones with DLCs. Why that's important is even more speculation though.
---
\&gt;ZeniMax will offer to provide refunds to consumers who contacted them between 24 November 2018 and 1 June 2019 to request a refund and have not already received one. Consumers who accept a refund will no longer be entitled to access and play the game.
---
It only applies to people who requested a refund in the date range mentioned.  Nothing says that you can request a refund now and get your money back.  It also only applies to AU
---
Dude I'm gonna add you! Level ain't no issue!  I got stuff to help ya
---
I think most people who use them are fighting other people who use them too.
---
If I remember correctly, I went to the Hunters Shack in the Mire and read some things from the terminal in there that triggered that quest.
---
Except you can't shoot while running
---
This is IMPORTANT. The last pre-order disappointment I was involved in was No Man's Sky but looking back FO76 was a much bigger let-down and at more cost in both money and time.  
---
I requested a refund on NMS but had played the game for more than 2 hours so was ineligible under Steam's rules. I went on to play the game for 30 hours and at less than £1 per hour had a reasonable time with it. The updates have made it much better and Hello Games are a tiny indie company that have turned the game around.  
---
I may seem like a hypocrite as I clocked up over 2,000 hours on FO76 and could have stopped earlier but you know, the old 'sunk cost fallacy' kept me coming back. That and the friends I made in the game.
---
For those of you hanging on in there you are probably realising it is a case of diminishing returns. I have friends who have played WoW for ever and I always wondered what kept them playing. It was a depth of content and the community. It's not for me, I hated the "kill x creatures" quests and spent only 600 hours on it. Still I considered my time spent in Azeroth as worth the money. Besides, it actually worked even with mid 2000s internet flakiness.
---
That a country like Oz has won a small victory for the consumer is an important landmark: these things happen rarely but are watershed moments.
---
At various stages of my 2K+ hours of play I was behind, then against and now behind the complainers. Like a proper game reviewer you need to ask someone who has been through the full cycle of joy and despair before diving into a commitment like FO76. Up until patch 9 or so I would have said to anyone asking for my recommendation to buy the game. BGS's shenanigans and me getting bored with the game mean I would not do so now with the caveat though that I did have some good times in Appalachia.  
---
It's evident to everyone paid shills included that the game is beyond repair and in fact BGS knew from the start it would never evolve into something remotely "finished". The game has been in beta for a over year if you ask me. It's like the Steam Early Access scam but on a grander scale.  
---
So I've left the game (tons of shit over 9 accounts left to give away if I ever log on again) and can't foresee a time when I'd happily launch into that world with its buggy, diluted gameplay except to chat with those few friends again who I have on Discord anyway.  
---
No other game has left me with this feeling after so many hours. I suspect nostalgia might kick in in a few years but by then lord only knows what state this game will be in if it still exists.  
---
I'm an older games player and I think there were two peaks of video games: in the arcades, mid to late 80s and sometime around 2010 for home video games. Before micro-transactions and log in for daily action points kind of shit took hold.  
---
But hey, if you have a PC and an internet connection you have access to decades of good games, a lot of it free or almost free. And there's always indie games which may well turn out to be the salvation of this hobby we love.
---
/rant
---
Is your power armour pieces in your inventory? Check apparel
---
Hey fanboys. It's me, your favorite downvote button.
---
I just want to say, my popcorn taste amazing #popcorn.
---
When I started this game, I lost so many bullets and progression because of crashes. You guys told me how the game was in "kinda early access", making up this new word. The funny thing here is how you are telling this for free. Bethesda and other developers are literally taking advantage of the no brain tunnel vision fanboys, which I agree that is sad af but it's working. This is nothing new, where instead of actually promoting their fans, they use them.
---
Anyway, one year have passes. Is the game still in this acceptable early access state? Just wondering, would love to hear your arguments. Having fun with your girlfriend doesn't count I'm sorry.
---
Erm it's still spawning here. I just got another pumpkin plan.
---
Is this the only PvP game that people are able to cheat in? I find that hard to believe.
---
The news here is zenimax refused refunds &amp; that's illegal in Australia
---
*Very small rocks!*
---
wah wah wah
---
Its your PA. They probably used to all be on frames (10 weight each) but there was an update where they pulled each piece off the frames (5-15 weight per piece) so instead of each set weighing 10, they weigh 50-80. Put them all back on the frames and you'll be back to normal.
---
The modules you need for silo runs now have a substantial weight.
---
Also angryamerican talked about some loose screws... I need those.
---
If ps4 go to the game dont press it drag down and it should say like overwiew and press thet then press trophys. If xbox idk
---
Good cause i need those screws man.
---
There was an update earlier this year that took all your power armor pieces off the frames. It should have spawned you mear a railroad station so you could stash everything or whatever you needed to do.
---
update on power armour. your carring all your armour as seperate pieces and will need to sort all out again........probably.
---
PC here and I haven't crashed at all. Maybe I'm lucky.
---
It did lag out once though. Whole server standing around waiting for it to proceed and it just timed out.
---
There was an update a while back to fix some PA related issues.  
---
When they did that, basically all armor parts on frames were removed from them. It was all in the patch notes, but I couldn't for the life of me tell you which patch it was.  
---
Best bet is to crawl to the nearest stash box and get your gear straightened away.  
---
The ammo perk wasn't changed in any way, shells have always weighed about that.
---
Really would depend on who got rounds on target first. If the players were of equal skill I’d say the AAFFR has the advantage. In all other instances, especially when stealth is involved the Bloodied build is going to be superior, largely because of the unyielding bonuses. 
---
I have characters using both builds, They are both very fantastic and effective. If I had to have just one for the game as a whole, I’d go with the Bloodied build simply because if the increased stealth and less resource expenditure.
---
Griefers now have unlimited storage
---
For calling me a liar. I'm not saying it was you but it was a lot of people.
---
Yup. Well said. I too am a lone wanderer...
---
Have you tried Outer Worlds yet...? You might like it. My gf just got it as a suprise!  So again I will fight the good fight...alone.
---
Spunds like a self-perpetuating cycle. If everyone is only using them, because everyone is using them, and *they're* only using them because...
---
I don't get it - you store all your junk on your character and still engage in PvP?  You stand to loose all that junk whether or not the opponent is a Fallout 1st owner or not.
---
The dumpsters near the whitespring service entrance has a lot of bones, although sometimes it's picked clean. I had to use that spot to get my foot bones, but I think only one foot spawns at a time.
---
Well I mean how long are you standing still though after another player starts shooting back. I'd say they have the same benefit as the other. You will be running in a lot of fight, for cover etc. I have 3 peices of s/a and some cav assassins. I'm liking the cav so far. It's a hard choice tbh.
---
If you stored all your junk on you your retarded
---
Not sure why you are downvoted, it's pretty clear 76 has struggled to hit expectations.
---
*Turns over record, doesn't hear anything*
---
I think it’s safe to safe they’ve pretty much abandoned it already. The only posts I’ve seen them reply to were a couple fallout 1st posts and a couple about the broken event. People have been expressing concern after concern with no cm replys or even a post at the very least. So much for that “communication” they said they’d get better at.
---
If you're worried about losing your stuff don't pvp. Even before 1st it wouldn't have made sense to if you had all your junk on you.
---
Lmfao nice reading skills bud
---
No, I don't want to pvp. I got griefed by a Fallout 1st player, who robo-danced on my corpse as he took my junk.
---
I sound like someone trying to convince people to play Outer Worlds? Hardly. To me, $60 for 25-30 hours of gameplay is hardly worth it for a Borderlands/Fallout short story.
---
They're pretty easy to come by, I can't imagine you'd get much, if anything, for them.
---
I don't pvp. I got griefed.
---
The point of PTS is to get as many people on the server as possible playing and actively trying to break new or old features of the game before the new patch launches. This give the devs a little bit of time to find and maybe address bugs before they go to the live servers and bork everything up. Forcing people to pay to help fix their game seems counterproductive.
---
Nah man you THOUGHT you wanted an online fall out experience.
---
Blyat
---
Fantastic thanks really enjoyed
---
Then what are you doing running around with your Passive Player turned off?  Especially carrying that much junk!!
---
Aww i would invite you on my private server but im on pc lol
---
Thanks!
---
Da, znayu
---
Your target buyers are super low level players, I think the first set of power armor is 15 (may be wrong) so I can't imagine you'll get anything more than 10-50 caps.
---
20 caps
---
Get rid of the "Part of the Structure would be inaccessible" check and the "Object intersects another" check.
---
Bro it’s fallout. No true fan of the franchise cares about PvP and as a fallout 1st subscriber you’ll never catch me outside of my private world. Now 76 can be like an actual fallout game that I’m able to play with my friends. Fuck PvP and griefers they don’t even exist anymore just like they rightfully didn’t in previous games.
---
Nothing, sorry.
---
They are pretty common to find (if they are empty). I wouldn't sell them I would scrap them to count towards scrapping PA atom challenge.
---
Do you have a One X? Seems to solve all my issues when gaming. The OG just can't process new games correctly.
---
It's a serious crime that right behind you baby was in the first F76 trailer but isn't in the actual game.
---
Thanks to you and the others who suggested it was power armour
---
Apparantly Patch 11 did a thing on July 16
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-players-are-begging-bethesda-for-a-test-server-after-a-buggy-patch/
---
Look at all the shills, downvoting legitimate consumer anger, to prevent it being seen. Complaining about whiners, when they are here, reading through every comment, and literally whining. Disgusting
---
My passive was turned on. I claimed a workshop because I was overweight, to store some stuff, then out of the blew a guy contests my claim and kills me. Then I try to get my stuff back and pvp ensues.
---
I love some of the new junk decor pieces, like the Lighthouse Souvenir, and the House Teapot. I would totally display these in my kitchen!
---
That means after this dates they will have to give refund otherwise you can go to court and get refund by the force of law.
---
No problem thanks for taking the time to post
---
“If they add exp and cap boosters as well as increased camp budget to only 1st members, thats gonna be a straw too much for me” you literally said it would be the last straw for you....
---
But it's easier to *not* fix it, knowing that some people will still pay!
---
In hindsight, this game should never have been released on standard Xbox one.
---
Not becaurse its such a broken game.
---
" The ACCC has accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from three related video gaming companies after they acknowledged they were likely to have ***misled consumers about their consumer guarantee rights*** "
---
Not becaurse FO76 is a broken game, but Australians as us here in Europe have better refund rights.
---
I use bolstering heavy metal, although heavy leather limbs are good too. I'm not a low health build, but I worry more about my health when I'm low, it's like PANIC button armour.
---
Definitely use the blocker perk card. 
---
I also recommend 1 rank of born survivor or a piece of auto stim... And I've heard good things about 3 ranks of serendipity, but I've never actually tried it out, it looks good though.
---
I've been wrong before, and here we are again!
---
After some research, and input from yourself and one other, it appears they changed that, and I just never noticed because after I tested the junkie weapons I haven't touched them since.
---
Indeed, the instance is still on the same server though, your system just doesn't have to load more than 8 people, and most of the time far less.
---
I hate to break this to you, but that isn’t griefing.
---
Other games ban cheaters. At least try to warn them not to cheat. This game doesn't do any of that
---
If you fought back then you have no one to blame. If they killed you with mines, then that sux, but it isn't just fallout 1st subscribers doing it. Jerks will be jerks to anyone they find.
---
Fallout 1st player or not, you took an enormous risk claiming a workshop and carry all your junk.  I would suggest that you at least start another character and move some of your inventory to it so your not jeopardizing all your junk.
---
It's not exactly pushing any limits, why do you think it should have been held for the newer systems?
---
Have any of these IRL locations influenced where you placed your camp in game?
---
Yes, that!
---
Honestly idk what to tell you other than keeping all of your junk on you is just a dumb thing to do. You have a stash box with 800 storage capacity for a reason.
---
Plenty in the forest by vault 76
---
With this and any other possible scenario it doesn’t matter if they were a subscriber or not you still could have got gotten anyway!!!
---
That one was really great!
---
No, that wasn't. What was briefing was his continued attacking me for the rest of my time on that server.
---
Thats nothing to do with FO1st, you took the workshop, you wouldn't of even known it was a Fo1st had they not robodance'd your corpse.
---
Yeah I’m closer to your success rate with this event, usually run 4-6 a day and am unable to get through 1 or 2 and it is infuriating when it happens.
---
 “ZeniMax has acknowledged that they are likely to have misled certain  Australian consumers about their rights to a refund **when they  experienced faults with their Fallout 76 game**,” ACCC Commissioner Sarah  Court said. 
---
 “When a consumer has purchased a product that **has a fault which amounts  to a major failure**, the Australian Consumer Law provides them with the  right to ask for their choice of either a repair, replacement or  refund.” 
---
\-----
---
So, it's kind of a little bit of both.
---
That has not aged well....
---
&gt;For Fallout 1st owners, pvp now possesses no consequences, other than a minor loss of caps. Death in its entirety is pretty much meaningless to them. They can pvp freely without worrying if any junk on them will be lost as a result of their death.
---
Buy Fallout 1st you say 🤔
---
TL;DR - got invited to a server with a few other fully min/maxed players that probably have god rolls on gear, and farmed stuff. It was fun.
---
Not gonna lie, if I still played 76, this is what I'd be doing. I'd even go so far as to make a "clan" where I'd only invite good players that I could help min/max. Sucks that there just isn't anything left for me to do in this game besides help others.
---
O caps. They're very easy to find
---
You have to get them from Southern Belle Hotel and there is only a few there. Can’t be from anywhere else.
---
Im sorry OP but i will not sympathise with you and this will be a bethesda bashing comment so be warned reader. And to those rolling their mentally vocalizing not this again. Yes. Yes this again. Because they haven't gotten the message yet. I will continue to bash bethesda until they correct their ways. And this sub realizes that it deserves better. Far better than this piss poor excuse of a game.
---
 This right here, is and was always the real end game. 
---
I am sorry mate. You chose to support this game. A game that since it came out has actively and consistently chosen to defile the trust placed in it by one of the most stupidly loyal and sometimes rabid fanbase. I mean at release the writing was on the wall that this was a hastly scraped together content devoid integrity lacking sorry excuse of a not even passable semblance of a game.
---
Its like a corporate slime ball and a mobile developer had sex on a keyboard and this was the end result.
---
But somehow it just keeps getting worse and worse. I mean a bucket of afterbirth has more content than this game. And at some point one has to wonder whether this is a game that has a lot of bugs or a crapfest of bugs with bits and pieces of a game?
---
And the playerbase. Dont even get me started on the playerbase. Look. I like games. They really help take the edge off at times. But this recent trend of making everything online so that publishers can monopolize the living daylights out of the playerbase if frankly getting old and is downright disgusting. I mean if you people continue to support this and many other games like \*cough\* anthem \*cough\* then what kind of a message does it send to the developers? You see where im getting at?
---
This is why this type of business model and these types of gaming practices need to be rebuked and rebuked very sternly.
---
So sorry OP but you brought this on yourself. Peace.
---
One could hope but seeing as how its a hot selling point for It i doubt it.
---
 Honestly i think within a year the game will be subscription based only. What they will do is leave the public servers open and slow drip content to bleed what they can from the non subscribers in the atom shop until even they get bored and leave. Then they will keep everything good exclusive to the subscription service. Even making some items only work if you keep the service active. Eventually any new story or world altering content will be a fallout 1st exclusive. once they have chased away anyone unwilling to pay for fallout 1st, they kill the public servers and the game becomes completely subscription based. Certain players have allready shown they are happy to fork over more money on top of the minimum entrance fee from purchasing the game. 
---
Like it or not this game still has a decent size fan base and no doubt as i post this zenimax/ Bethesda is working on even more ways to screw a portion of long time fans over in favor of those they can keep draining money from.
---
You're right, five times is an exaggeration. It'd be nice if the boss would scale depending on how many people were in the event. Switching to a different weapon to tag seems obvious but these aren't exactly smart or rational people.
---
Ok looks like I'm not selling them
---
Umm I’ve gotten them from other places and they’ve counted. I usually get mine from around Berkeley Springs honestly.
---
It seems a standard Xbox can’t handle more than a couple of cars exploding simultaneously.
---
so we should apologize for your lack of reading comprehension? pass
---
Xbox. Seems like more people are experiencing it on xbox, and a bit less on ps4 based off the comments. Just my speculation though
---
They are actually a bit different, the atom one is a different shade with a flat top, the event one is rounded. Also the atom shop one can be crafted, but the event one cannot.
---
There's only a 3 dollar difference really. I can't tell the difference.
---
Ohh, right cheers
---
Willing to bet the bought version can't be traded. Or maybe it was supposed to be a diff model? Who knows. Most shit from the atom shop is busted.
---
I tried that before and it didn’t count. I’m going to try again next time I get it. Maybe I was t picking the right flowers.
---
It's super fun when it works!
---
This sub will never apologize OP. Rather if you stay here too long they might even end up convincing you to even get the damn game since its so good. Makes you even wonder whether this sub has any real players left or its just paid shills. Save your time and money OP.
---
I am right there with you. I may be able to hear but there are times when i do not have the option to chat on the mic, due to too much background noise or the game chat just wont work for some odd reason. A text chat would be great. They know how to do it. They have it in ESO so it should be real easy to import it into their other games.
---
Ugh that sucks... at that point theres no chance of making it back in in time....
---
I think the problem with Mischief Night is that they decided to have a rather intense event in the middle of *Whitesprings*.
---
I can travel the world and not run into performance problems on my PC, but the moment I get to Whitesprings, my framerate tanks.  I don't know what it is they are doing in that area, but it runs miserably.  And then, on top of that, you add the fact that it's a popular CAMP site, so you're loading those assets in and out as you move around, and enemy spawners that are occasionally on overdrive, and you have a total mess that should have been cleaned up because
---
I know ash flowers won’t count.
---
Fo76 facing many courts. Yet i didn't see anything change...
---
That’s not at all what the decision was.
---
Og course. Usually i refund games becaurse they dont work as good as i hoped for, or i didnt enjoy it. Guess thats the most usual reasons.
---
But on the other hand... dont play a game 100 hours then demand a refund. What zenimax did wrong here was this " ZeniMax representatives told consumers that they were not entitled to a refund ".
---
Of course atom shop items can't be traded. They can be craftet and nobody would buy them if that would be the case.
---
But like some people here already said, there actually is a slight difference in those models. Sad for those thaz bought it from the shop
---
Along with every other promise they made
---
nah, most of this sub just knows how to read past the title lmfao
---
Again, I get what you are trying to say, but it may or may not be the same from the company management's point of view. After all, similar reasoning would also have applied to the B.E.T.A., yet in the end it was still more of an early access demo for those who pre-ordered. Although I do not think the number of testers is the main issue in any case, even 10% of the entire player population is a lot more than Bethesda's QA team, the limiting factor is more likely to be the duration of the test period vs. the manpower available to actually fix all the problems that have been found. And they might not even want to run too many servers specifically for testing.
---
Never bought any, kind of a rule of mine with games these days. I do not allow myself to get nickeled and dimed to play a game. I buy the game and if there’s additional content with additional costs and I want it, that is when I shell out more money.
---
They may not consider your deafness but they do consider our stupidity.
---
I looked ot up, you were right. I concede.
---
It's not just this game you can get a refund for. Any game you'd be able to refund within a short period. Just y'know, they refused to give refunds illegally back then, so now have to give those refunds now.
---
I dont think* so.. I'm playing on an xbox one s I bought just a few months ago...
---
The only difference is that ESO is not a broken mess and has plenty of actual content.  
---
Kinda like Bethesda skipped several steps here lol.
---
Fireman helmet can be bought in whitesprings for cheap cheap
---
If they had experts in social psychology during development and psychology applied to marketing this game would have been a success
---
It still only applies to AU, and since I'm surprised an online video game is being treated as a product rather than a service since it receives constant updates, I don't know if they can go to Bethesda directly if they didn't buy it from Bethesda Directly, and based on the wording, it doesn't seem to be a full refund:
---
&gt;You are only entitled to recover costs from a manufacturer or importer, which include an amount for reduction in the product’s value and in some cases compensation for damages or loss.
---
or things like:
---
&gt;The business may take into account how much time has passed since you bought the product considering the following factors:  
---
&gt;type of product  
---
&gt;how a consumer is likely to use the product  
---
&gt;the length of time for which it is reasonable for the product to be used  
---
&gt;the amount of use it could reasonably be expected to tolerate before the failure becomes noticeable.  
---
&gt;For a major problem with services you can cancel the contract and obtain a refund or seek compensation for the drop in value of your services provided compared to the price paid.
---
I would imagine based on the above, it might be harder for someone who was a release day buyer who has hundreds of hours in the game to get a full refund a year later.  But IANAL, but I would imagine that after the case - they set those dates for a reason.
---
and when they balance they make shit straight up irrelevant like they did with two shot
---
Look, I can see your point.
---
This game was advertised as a way to play online with others, it was never supposed to be a solo experience. They said you could play the game by yourself if you wanted to, but there were never any guarantees that other players wouldn't show up.
---
Maybe you can use your money to make them stop attacking you?
---
This is probably my biggest gripe about fallout 76
---
Woah woah woah.   Scaling to the player count?   That’s a tall ask for Beth, who can’t even make the event stable enough to not crash 75% of the time
---
I have picked up quite a few really nice plans out of it (don't really care about the costume pieces I picked up) 
---
I still kinda regret I didn't play during meat week
---
These are all good tips. Thanks for sharing. I already have two different sniper characters, so I will try to make a commando build. Suicide. I know :-) Do you know if the various perks that increase DR count against the berserker effect?
---
Did you really compare your toxic relationship to video games with domestic violence? Wtf is wrong with you
---
So what do you want to know? Is it a mistake? I dont think they'd actually go on record and say that.
---
I’ve got all the plans I just need the pirate costume and the two orange suits
---
I'm not sure why they never implemented it to begin with if ESO has it already. Surely it can't be that hard to write the code in
---
Thanks. That would make it so much easier.
---
They're really just private instances. It's easier to understand what's actually going on if you call them that, because private servers makes it sound like we have access to soecial hardware, when really we're on the same servers as everyone else. Just different instances.
---
Hmm you get what you paid for but I can feel your sentiment since they said there wouldn’t be any PAID DLC’s . I can see why your upset . I’d be too
---
Given they have said it will change the face of the game and the biggest update/dlc, one would think so, but they will probably keep it just under the minimum guideline
---
It has nothing to do with the atom store or fallout 1st, though.
---
That's a polite way of saying it. They are a steamy pile of mutant hound poo.
---
I've been so un-adventurous as far as my camp location is concerned, I've really only had 3 camp locations (I always like to be near water).  I really need to expand my horizons and try to camp out at one of these places! I visited a camp yesterday at the top of Seneca Rocks that was really awesome!
---
I refuse to upvote this until I see the camp
---
No, it does separate rolls. Same goes for enemy's resistance.
---
&gt; all the future new content which we get access for free
---
Bethesda: Hey, we know we promised to have a ton stuff in game at ya know, launch? But we decided to just slowly update/fix the game to what it should have been at launch over the next couple years. And guess what it's gonna be free!
---
Consumer: What did I pay $60 for then?
---
I see the Oko problem has gotten so bad it's spilled into the plane of West Virginia...
---
You can just equip and unequip the perk to test it...
---
I can’t ever interact with those bowls. Is it cause someone got to them first?
---
This. So much this. SWTOR went the same route as ESO and I was OK with that because the game has actual great content. Very fun PvP and PvE raids. And everything there just works. No horrible lag on servers, no broken boss mechanics. 
---
Charge full price for a game and then want a sub fee too? Fine, but that game better be amazing and 99.9999% bug free. Charge full price for a game, want a sub, AND have a cosmetic shop? OK, but again, game better be flawless. Charge full price, require a sub, and add pay to win mechanics? Not OK. And doing all of that on a broken game that lacks content? Awful.
---
BGS, you are throwing away your fan base to make a quick buck. I know hundreds of people that I talk to regularly through my YouTube channel / Discord community that have said they will never touch another BGS game due to your treatment of your fans in this game. You need to start making this right, or start looking for new jobs, because you're going to go the way of all those game companies that died under EA due to horrible broken games with awful monetization practices.
---
Okay look I’m upset with Bethesda’s handling of the atom shop and have myself quit playing entirely for the time being. 
---
However, it’s disingenuous to compare the unlimited scrap container to the original request of more stash space. The scrap container holds a finite list of materials. All they have to track in their databases is the quantity of each. This is a lot less data to store than a stash which can contain anything, with each item having a different GUID (tracking number, unique identifier, whatever) and also tracking the quantity of each. With the latter situation, they’d have to plan for the hoarders out there (and we are many) who would have possibly thousands of unique items in their stash. With the scrap container, they know exactly what they have to plan for - there’s a very limited list of shit. 
---
That being said, the scrap container being behind a paywall is bullshit. Same with the secondary tent.
---
Wait. You guys are getting paid?!?
---
I took that onboard when I started playing the game in B.E.T.A and found that it could be enjoyed solo and that made me keep on playing it. As said, I did try to interact but it was so clunky and full of misunderstanding that I gave up. I think it's great that the fallout world has been opened up to a new type of gamer but feel we solo players have been somewhat ignored, especially with the recent seasonal quests. The private servers have tempted me back to 76 and I dare say a lot more solo/traditional players too. I'm just a bit miffed i have to pay extra for it.
---
Far too easy to get them on your own. I'd just give them away to a noob that you see coming out of the vault, along with a few free fusion cores.
---
I suppose I could take a point from Endurance and give it to Perception, drop Sunkissed and Green Thumb and get Grenadier 2 instead. That radiation damage healing is nice, though. Radiation damage is kinda my achilles heel with this build
---
What paid DLC?
---
Multi-shelf display cases would be cool to put those kind of things in. I am imaging things like in the Watoga HS.
---
It makes sense, but I PvP a lot and it's not unreasonable for most people to agree to no teslas. Some people refuse to PvP any other way though, and in that case all I do is not play with them.
---
If they don't want to get downvoted then they need to tell us something besides the usual bullshit excuses or ignoring the current problems.
---
The one from the atom shop looks better and more like a pirate hat. The event one is a good bit taller and has a weird edge and a rounder front tip. Sad for those that only got the drop.
---
Hey if you're on PS4 I'll throw down some capperinos for that OP. I'm gonna keep playing the event but in case I don't snag it then I'll have to spend some hard farmed atoms. Please don't make me :(
---

---
\^ Do that. Run bloodied with Ultracite (or better yet, strangler) power armor. The only thing that sucks is managing your rads when in a nuke zone, but you get used to it.
---
Why are you being downvoted? Youre correct. Why are people so rabid to defend being lied to?
---
They haven’t refunded anyone yet, as far as I know.
---
Ok shill see ya later, giving a company more money after they already bent you over and shafted you is fucking idiotic, sure they can spend their money however they want, doesn’t mean it’s not a waste, directly contributing to the massive issues in the industry right now, or just plain moronic behavior because it is all 3 of those things
---
Thank you. Buses would be great too. The assets are all in game, they would just need to grant us access to them. I move my camp every couple of weeks. Often times I end up using the rail car by the military boot camp.
---
I concur with the need for additional game loops. A scavenger hunt ability set would be awesome. Able to drop clues in different places? Start at the last point and work your way backwards. Put some huge reward at the end! I would have a lot of fun doing that. I loved that about some of the Nuka Cola rewards.
---
So many fucking brainless shills in this sub man I swear
---
I'm tempted but I'm going to wait until next month (it's my birthday 😁) Only ever played fallout for the past 8 years. Tried other games and none hook me in the way Fallout has. I had a good stab at Days Gone. Being a biker and loving all things zombie, I thought it would be the one to prize me away from Fallout. Although it was a great and enjoyable game it never made me want to play through again. Fight the good fight my fellow wanderer 👍
---
There is! r/fallout76settlements
---
Do events and side quests in areas that are level appropriate.
---
Also the dumpsters behind main ws building
---
Goat legs are useless most of the time if you have the healing factor mutation
---
It’s funny, I work in Boston and while I do think it’s cool that FO4 takes place there, everything seems so much more well known it doesn’t feel like a big deal to actually go to the Old North Church, for example. 
---
I had never heard of any of these places prior to playing the game. The attention to detail they played in building out the world is really amazing. I still can’t get over the pumpkin house being a real place haha.
---
Yeah there's like half a dozen you get from that.
---
Also it's funny you were down voted for a legit example. Have an upvote to balance.
---
Oh dang, Oko has invaded Appalachia!
---
...and apparently I follow it, derp.  Please forgive me, I really should not post before coffee... 😂
---
Wear power armor then kill the high level mobs
---
I can't give you advice on how to level quickly, but I can give you advice.
---
The game kind of sucks at telling you where you should go. The safest way to play is try to find every landmark on the map in each zone(because some landmarks have quests, but also you get exp for discovering them) and you should explore the zones in this order: Forest, toxic valley, ash heap, savage divide, mire, and cranberry bog. Although generally once you hit the savage divide everything after that scales from 1 to max level depending on who spawned the monsters in.
---
But yeah, try to do the toxic valley and ash heap once you finish the forest.
---
A few people here wrote they got their items back and then some via ticket.
---
And like I said, my RL friend had it happen to him.
---
not ever post is as obvious as it seems. ;)
---
My bday is December and I think my gf is buying me BORDERLANDS 3! It's a match made in Heaven...she buys me video games and I play them! She wont game with me but she doesnt knock it!
---
That was brilliant in time and manor!
---
Yes, they do. But you shouldnt need it in all honesty. Especially if you run wood armor. Your like a ghost in the wind if you have a max agility and sneak 3 equipped. I was pvping someone, i was hiding in the bushes. The guy literarily couldnt find me. I sat there for 20 mins hitting him with throwing knives while he looked in every direction. Priceless. Lol. I plan on upgrading my current armor to the thorn armor when i get all the pieces i need. Going to take awhile though. And it shouldnt be suicide, i run commando on my Berserker's. As long as you use silenced weapons your fine. I use a handmade and a fixer. I switch to rifleman sometimes though, just to conserve ammo.
---
Here you go dude https://drive.google.com/file/d/139YtPMVQTlp29S_pcGrafPu2LkFzobKT/view?usp=sharing
---
Same here, my build is very unique nobody else has done it.
---
For clarity, the part that they admit to being misleading was about the right to a refund for Australian players.
---
I have a ticket, and they said they’d notify me when I got a refund (it hasn’t happened yet).  They should be refunding everyone at the same time.  Also, I’m almost certain I won’t be getting back more junk than I had put in my scrapbox.  Hopefully I’m wrong, but I had the junk from 13 characters lost after I consolidated it all into one box.
---
This game has been a disaster since launch the person responsible for it should get a award for creating the biggest dumpster fire of the decade and continuous horrible mismanagement.
---
better to just give them to lower lvls
---
It only ever boosted the explosive part of the damage anyway, so demo expert is really a waste of 5 points tbh.
---
How many items on that short list do we honestly believe wont be part of Fallout 1st?
---
I dont play video games because I like playing video games. I play fallout because I like fallout.
---
At Leve l25:
---
You likely feel overpowered for the forest, about even in the toxic valley, and severely under-powered for the divide, mire, and bog.  
---
Whitesprings is still intimidating, and you likely die a lot.  But if conditions are right, you can be successful in parts of whitesprings.
---
OTOH, with the halloween event ongoing, WS will be full of high levels, which will cause enemy scaling higher than you you want to deal with.  (Although if you stay alive during the even, you can get the rewards)
---
Anyway.... 
---
At 25, You should be working on the mysteries questline and the western side of the map portions of the BoS questline adn Roses quest.  You may or may not have completed the quest that starts around Wavy willards.  
---
You are also about ready to venture into the ash heap and start working towards obtaining excavator armor.
---
I’m farming solar armour set, it will take me a while to get decent rolls 😅
---
You're not the only one. I've seen dozens of this exact post :-) And I had the same problem. You need to stay off the main quests for a while and explore the ash heap and toxic valley for a while. 
---
The best way to level up, in my opinion, is to go farm Whitesprings and the Uranium Fever event. You will die but who cares :-)  If you can get good gear - heavy combat armor and a good legendary weapon - you can take these risks and the rewards are high. Also, sleep in a bed and do the Feed the people event to get canned stew. This will boost your xp .
---
Not sure if it still works, but in the past you've been able to double-stack walls going in both directions (to expose both sides as "interior") as long as you originally place them as doors....they can then be changed to whatever you need them to be. Hopefully it still works and helps some people out!!
---
What really bothers me right now is I use powered doors to keep the riff-raff out and you cannot apply wallpaper to the interior side of those....so I've got a lovely room with two very busted looking walls. :(
---
You say that, but Fallout 2 is a far superior game to 76 lol it’s attention to detail was crazy for the time.
---
tanagra town is good too
---
It's only been a week-ish. Gotta give them time to actually fund the fixes. FO76 lost them a LOT of money, I'm sure the crew was down to a bare minimum.
---
Fall out first is Downloadable Content isnt it ? And it’s paid lol
---
There are about 5 broken Possum World challenges as well.
---
I'll wait a little bit and see for how much it's going after the event is over. Come back at me if you didn't get it yourself. :)
---
Spawns have been crazy like this ever since Fallout 1st patch. I ran into 8 scorpions outside Grafton the other day.
---
I wouldn’t do BOS until you do free states and that only comes after rose
---
Loving every bit of it. People coming together to absolutely wreck shit. It's incredible.
---
You're just having a great week, sir, enjoy it!
---
Crash and cash.
---
If they had a handmade skin instead of assualt rifle skins EVERYONE would be in NW! Lol
---
What’s the point of the meat hook and cultist dagger plans? I mean cool I got them but what for? Lol
---
I havent been able to switch servers and join and complete a 2nd event.. I did that a bunch with meat week though
---
You could always play Fallout 4, or wait for Fallout 5. Or play one of the other single player installments. The subscription is a necessary thing, this game was bleeding money like crazy. I don't see why anyone is miffed, they never said that all features would be free. They only said the DLC would be.
---
I do hope you continue to enjoy your solo experience though.
---
Boomer is also bugged. The quest appears but when I go talk to him he acts like there is no quest going on and doesn't let me go on with the explosives part
---
what the Fuck is wrong here?
---
They should fix it and run the event on extension on affected consoles. I don't think there's currently any upcoming new events or features that would make it difficult.
---
Fairly sure it's not happening much on PC, where I play.
---
i was going to put my camp near summersville town but it's just as boring and featureless as the real thing lol
---
yOu CaN'T wIn In FaLlOuT 76
---
True. I'll have to do it when I get home
---
Actually the upcoming wastelanders was not promised with the game as it was always said that the game would start out with no npcs. So you point only has some merit and still fallout 1st is not hurting any none subscribers.
---
I think there's a lot more stuff in the pool for this one.  IIRC, a data miner said the drop rate RNG/percentages were equalized for almost all items.
---
That does double duty, in that the chance of getting something unique increases, which in turn keeps repeat runs by any given player higher.
---
Additionally, the increased difficulty is probably appreciated by higher level players.
---
"Lets add annoying game mechanics that we can $ell shortcuts to get around later"
---
I see it going f2p and sub/ atom buyers being their cash source. Kids spending gift cards on the console store is fallout income.
---
bethesda: y'all hear sum'n?
---
A whole skeleton can be found at the mothman museum. Jump to the city there, cross the bridge and keep left near the water. There's a tent/pavillion with a lot if mothman eggs. On the table there's a sacrificed full skeleton
---
lol, someone downvoted so it must be a shill? with that logic anyone who upvoted is a shill for a competing gaming studio. just because you feel one way does not mean other fallout players do.
---
I’m curious how they’ll remedy this. Ladydev said they’re investigating the issue. Halloween is over, but maybe they should extend the event through next week and hotfix something to make it crash less.
---
Just go to their spawn point and they will be there...If you do not know their spawn point then learn them....they are really easy to learn
---
Finish the forrest first the go off to the toxic vally and then go to the ash heap to get your excavator power armor then savage divide
---
Ok and?
---
Nice, although for me the game has already died. It would be a completey 180 for Bethesda to finally do something for good.
---
because they are whining. lol
---
 munchausen syndrome give this a looky
---
 The embarrassment never ends for Fallout 76. The latest news is that the  Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission is making ZeniMax  offer refunds to Fallout 76 where they'd previously denied them.   According to the government body, ZeniMax was misleading when it told  people they weren't entitled to a refund for the broken, buggy, rubbish  game. They will now have to pay up.   This follows the whole "Fallout 1st" debacle, where Bethesda charged  $100 for a yearly subscription that was, itself, completely broken. It  just doesn't end. It. Just. Doesn't. End.
---
You can get it inside Whitesprings from the bot that sells expensive CAMP plans. It is like 1k caps depending on your perks.
---
Man, asking for a lot there from them.
---
You got it from the Halloween event that's going on now. I really like it
---
you have to go to the terminal and start it.
---
I *was falling to my death not infrequently before I got it, I like to do huge Marsupial run jumps when travelling and they get me into trouble sometimes. I SUPPOSE I could just not do that
---
Asside they probably are being compensated, downvoting serves no purpose. They are not Bethesda, they have nothing to say.
---
Haven't had it crash yet on my One X after about 10 runs of the event.
---
if you are on ps4 id be down to buy those unwanted outfits off you, i wont be able to play much at all this next week so this is probably the only way ill get any outfits!
---
psn id FritoZ
---
They have done it before. To some players who got hacked, to some who lost all carried items on raids. They are getting better at this.
---
Yeah, what they said!
---
Nice, that's good scrip
---
It took you a week to post this? After 1000 other people already said the same exact thing? God this sub really sucks!!!
---
Oh you wanted the dlc Bethesda support pack? That'll be 12.99 a month.
---
That's pretty cool you work in Boston, but I can see your point. From an outsider's perspective, I would LOVE to visit Boston and see some of the FO4 places. I had heard of the more well-known places, but I also learned about some things I didn't know. 
---
Just to have a game set in WV (the first of its kind, I believe) is cool, but you're right about the attention to detail being absolutely amazing. I learned things about my home state that I didn't even realize! And yes, the Pumpkin House is awesome and very real! 
---
I think you have commented on all my trip posts and I just wanted to say I appreciate that! :)
---
lazy bethesda.... or are they planning to make a 'pay to chat dlc' now?
---
No. Its server rental for private server.
---
Exactly what I thought when I read it, absolute bargain at that price
---
\*snickers\* Thought of a half dozen responses and decided against them all. This argument's a bit too... familiar for me. So...
---
Light travels faster than sound. That's why you seem to bright until I hear when you're saying! ;)
---
As they probably got few thounsands of players to track at least, then maybe they won't do them all at once.
---
But yeah, as long as I don't fall to my death healing factor takes care of it lickity fast
---
The dynamic between The Outer Worlds and Fallout 76 reminds me *so much* of the dynamic between The Orville and Star Trek Discovery.
---
One is a true to form classic, built on the principles and precepts of a well loved IP, but starting anew in its own universe; created and distributed in a normal, customer friendly manner. 
---
The other is a corporate bastardization of a well loved IP that carries the official brand, while exploiting its fandom to drive interest in an overpriced membership model.
---
You also get a tent and a stash . That’s DLC . Sorry buddy
---
Clutter sets yessssssssss
---
She's on PS4.
---
Aww, I feared I was just having a good week and that it was not permanent.
---
Please tell me the game ended there... I have some concerns that this escalated...
---
Cheers 👍 I've got a 1000+ hours invested in fallout 4 lol so was really looking forward to a fresh outlook to the fallout world with 76. I would give my left bollock for Fallout 5 right now 😂 I'm hoping they are working on it now for a release on the PS5 but I think that's a long shot tbh.
---
God damn I didn't know so many people watched meet the millers 🤣🤣
---
Yeah, or gettin 2 armor pieces with falling damage resintance to get the 100% falling resistance, i think 2 points on this perk is a waste lol
---
If they were persistent like Minecraft Realms I'd get one in a heartbeat.  With them being more expensive than Realms, there is no reason that they shouldn't be a persistent experience were your camp is there all the time and you can whitelist people to log on whenever they want.
---
You got lucky, it’s still mostly shit drops lol
---
I have got some decent drops this week from the purveyor, super mutants &amp; ghouls  this week
---
Bloodied limb damage less vats handmade
---
Bloodied explosive +1 perception double barrel
---
AAE ** LMG.
---
Definitely my best week since the start of the game.
---
I think despite the typo and errors, the game can still be interpreted.  
---
At the very least, the could use someone to help better fine-tune the little things.
---
For the loot, kind of.
---
However more effort could have been put into it, they’ve had a year to do it.
---
Not any more then other stuff that can be bought on  the atom store. Even skins and hairs styles is then DLC as it is downloaded.
---
Ouch. I wish you well on your recovery, man.
---
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Give me free things!
---
 i mean, you can have say 110 damage per shot or 140 damage per shot, seems worth it to me...
---
New from Bethesda: unlock general chat for only $5 per month! /s
---
OP, I'm with ya on the text chat. It would be better for everyone.
---
The price tag for a year is absolutely outrageous and should be condemned.
---
It's a blatant rip off from Bethesda.
---
Either you pay 144 a year separately or you pay a massive 100 upfront and it's a dirty form of making money
---
Nice!!
---
Unfortunately no, I'm on the infamous Xbox
---
Zero
---
I'm not sure when the window for the PS5 is, I would almost be willing to bet FO5 and TES6 both get released on PS4 first and then re-released for PS5. Or PS whatever they're going to call it.
---
Try fiddling with this one, it was a straight goddamn headache but I’ve still had some questionable amounts of fun with it.
---
Half-Dead Berserker Turret: 3 Unyielding AP Refresh/Sentinel + 2 Life-Saving Poisoner/Sentinel. Pneumatic chest &amp; lead-lined limbs. Wear the armor pieces and deliberately break them—the DR is gone but the resistance effects remain (unless I’m talking out my ass or something has changed with how broken armors work)
---
Mutations: Speed Demon, Marsupial, Adrenal Reaction, Healing Factor
---
Perks: Heavy Gunner (9), Blocker (3), Adamantium Skeleton (3), Revenant (2) Lone Wanderer (4), Nerd Rage (3), Suppressor (2), Adrenaline (5), Dodgy (3), Escape Artist (1), Mysterious Savior, Starched Genes (2), Class Freak (3) Serendipity (3).
---
This is, honestly, an atrociously bad set up.
---
I think Global Chat would defeat the purpose in a game like Fallout 76, where they do want you to wander around the landscape.  
---
However, the idea of local chat, team chat and area chat would definitely work, at least on paper.
---
Playstyle variations.  
---
II didn't do the questlines/steps in order.  l had all 3 questlines active simultaneously, completing them as my travels took me to the appropriate marked locations.  
---
I think I finished Rose part 1 and 2 before Bos part 2, and all segments of Freestates long before (the final) Rose and BoS segments.
---
Unfortunate
---
Then I can only help out through advice
---
I sold it for 800, so it must be kinda special.
---
Least you have achievements...
---
Oh wow. Yeah, I doubt you will be getting more junk back. That is quite a lot.
---
Pretty much sums up everything why a text chat is mandatory, even without any disabilities.
---
That's not how pacifist works... Beth nerfed the slap damage to 0 that's what's protecting people from this behavior.
---
100 a year is NOTHING. I spend more than that on coffee in a month. People are jumping up and down, screaming about how "expensive" it is. It really isn't, and if $13 a month/$100 a year would seriously break your budget, the ln you need to stop playing video games and get a second job. Or in the event that you're young enough to still be in school, you should probably be focused on schoolwork.
---
I haven't had that issue in months. It used to be a constant issue.
---
Big Iron would have been amazing or Jingle, Jangle, Jingle.
---
Butcher Pete is definitely an odd choice.
---
no its been 351 days since launch
---
When it doesn’t crash.
---
why would any @#$@$@ downvote this?  I mean do people really LIKE being disappointing by getting a 1 star from a  3 star enemy?
---
who defends this? WHY?
---
just make it so whatever star level you see is the amount of stars you will get!
---
It's constant spawn on the whitesrping robot vendor that sells camp plans that are made off of the decor inside that building.
---
How many times do we need to talk about this? STOP GIVING THEM IDEAS!!!!!!
---
Yo need bloody mess it gives you 15% more damage to all weapons at level 3, adrenaline, evasive and nerd rage are better perks than pack rat, junk shield, party boy
---
Oh nice!
---
Also mislead the customer when they said the game just works...
---
Oh I didn’t see it on the list of rewards someone posted
---
I remember now! Cheers.

As a kid i used to read lines like "Gamers donot like story in racing games", "Gamers donot care about single player games" from EA (way before i started using reddit)
---
And i thought it was strange. Now i realize that it was money deciding the directions, not gamer opinions
---
Luckily I've only seen that once.. I hopped to a different server before the event started.  but seriously.. You cant run around in costumes...
---
Enjoying your 100$ sub?
---
holy crap...... fresh air, do you breathe it?
---
Yeah and I love that song. But no, fuck that song let’s add some more butcher pete
---
You wouldn't get that much of a boost. 
---
Example: I have a Bloody Explosive Lever Action. The listed damage is 100. That's after the explosive bonus, and all perks (just an example). The explosive portion is only a 20% addition to the base damage, so the math on that is ~17 points of explosive damage. The total bonus from demo expert is 60%, so 60% of 17 is ~10. That's 5 perk cards for 10 extra damage. Not worth it, imho.
---

---
It's such a disappointment to the industry. I'm studying games tech and if I ever get thumbed over by some guy in a suit I hope the community backlashes and I will support them not buying our products for money grabbing purposes.
---
I like to follow the story. But yea it is open world so doesn’t really matter. It’s just harder to piece together lore when done or of order.
---
We were doing 3 an hour last night. Top of the hour hit a public server, then hit any private servers your group has.
---
Is it wrong I kinda wanna pay the 10 bucks to get this exclusive PvP survival experience? Lmao
---
Nope... I just replaced my xbox a few months ago. And theres way too many other people experiencing the problem as well.. it couldn't be hardware for 100s of people... well.. shouldnt* maybe..?
---
Wow biggest cuck statement if I ever saw one
---
Typical attitude of a bgs sheep
---
"it's your fault this happened because you didn't keep buying atoms"
---
No it's Bethesda who is at fault for being greedy corporate pricks that don't care for loyal players
---
Maybe depends on the day? Ive done it a few times arpund lvl 100 ish and got my ass handed dont really want to come back to it tell i have to quest it.
---
How do u use reddit? Text to speech software?
---
Couldn't that get them sued by the ACLU or some shit?
---
There is so much other stuff to do like the new event. Encryptid was popular due to it being annew boss fight, and it lost popularity and got stale. It regained popularity when the Fixer became legendary at the Purveyor if you learned the plan, then it slowly died down again. 
---
If you want people to join, don't start it near the Mischief Event or make a post on reddit/game platform you play on telling people you are starting one.
---
Bethesda did also lie about marketing but yeah true
---
Its definitely where you received it, its the only event I've been doing for the past couple days. And I received it also.
---
Haha! A couple of months back I stumbled across some random location in the forest that was overrun with these guys. But... I had never been chased down by a big herd of radstags before! They attacked! All of them!
---
I should have clarified in the post, I hosted it before misschief night was a thing, but the result kinda remained the same
---
That's fine with me, I solo the event so he literally doesnt have to do anything
---
Congratulations you clearly have more money than brains and can afford the luxury of throwing 100 dollars down the toilet to a company who doesn't give a shit about their players
---
100 dollars or whatever currency someone has is a lot of money and I frankly think those who spend loads on atoms and first membership are the ones who are pushing this shitty behavior
---
Haha. Had three scorchbests spawn at the same time with one being a 2 star.
---
We can be kindred spirits on that one... I did EXACTLY the same thing last week...
---
Just unlucky I suppose. Sometimes you need to check everyone's level in the server for over level 100 to get a good turnout.
---
There's a difference between caring about loyal customers and letting a game crash and burn for the sake of keeping a handful of vocal, entitled little shitheads like yourself quiet. Fallout 1st is doing well, it will improve the overall state of the game since there will actually be money to pay for maintenance and updates, and people like you will slowly fade out of the picture. Quickly, I hope.
---
If you called yourself a "loyal fan", and went out of your way to avoid spending any additional money, via the only method they had to generate more revenue, then you are both selfish and ignorant.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Or have a friend build bone chimes in their camp. You disarm them, they fix them and repeat. Worked like a charm.
---
Asking for money when they haven't even delivered on their initial promise is scummy.
---
And people buying FO 1st only validates that business model and makes it more likely they'll do scummy shit in the future.
---
I did more experimenting with the bug I was observing.
---
It seems the only way to use the "s76Password=" feature is to have your full password on it. Even if I have just the first character on there prewritten, and write the rest my own, it won't work, the login will always fail.
---
Really sucks as I don't want to have my full password there available to any trivial mod to read, so instead I have to use shorter and easier to remember password and type it always.
---
Oh well, maybe they will fix it later.
---
Hardly anyone was buying atoms. That's why we have the subscription now. Which, by the way, is much more cost effective than buying atoms was. 
---
Bethesda literally said "Please, buy atoms. We'll give you more for less, and extra benefits, just please, please spend some money. We're dieing here"
---
I have both money and brains. I make decent money BECAUSE I'm intelligent. Obviously moreso than you are, because you fail to see why the subscription was necessary.
---
I'm no loyal fan and never claimed to be
---
Bethesda shipped a game and has a moral and legal duty to keep it maintained, the fact they're doing that by hiding it behind a 100 dollar paywall is disgraceful
---
It really does amaze me that you seem to think that spending real money on in game purchases for a paid triple A game makes you better than us or somehow means your opinion is far more valid than ours
---
If you want to kiss Bethesdas ass and boot lick them that's your decision but don't act like you're above the rest of us because we refuse to purchase shed loads of atoms
---
Who was winning that fight?
---
Tip - try to find a server where high levels are doing Scorched Earth runs.  Pop Encryptid after the queen fight is over.
---
Canada- which in the fallout universe is part of USA.
---
Every creature has a spawn point....go to there and the corpse will be there....for example in the golf course clubhouse....behind the pool table...behind the bar...behind the counter....this is their spawn point....they go back there after killing them
---
There wasn't any revenue. The game LOST money at launch. They are just now correcting that with the subscription, so chill out. If you were that concerned you would have been buying atoms every month to help support the game.
---
It's not their only title. They are selling multiple products.
---
I think there are other things I'd rather have them working on...
---
With a different developer
---
That gives you all the individual pieces you need? You need to scrap specific bones.
---
Then Bethesda never should have shipped it as a paid game, they should have made free to play or subscription based from day one
---
Bethesda shipped a buggy ass game with numerous issues and knows full well it was the case
---
I shan't ever be supporting Bethesda again, the only reason I'll continue to play fallout is with friends
---
Yep
---
They said they were considering PA when they decided to go with WV instead.  I wonder if they're saving PA for the next single-player game.
---
If you think about this from a game writer's perspective, it gets interesting.  PA is rich with American history, and has the kind of stories that would be great to tell with NPCs.  It's begging for a Protectron that thinks he's Benjamin Franklin, for example.  WV on the other hand isn't as prevalent in the American consciousness, and you can weave its stories into cautionary tales like jobs fallen to automation.
---
Plus, PA is right next to NJ and what is more toxic than that?  It's a no-brainer.
---
It would be really funny if op was not a fallout first subscriber
---
There were 3 fog crawlers so they were def winning haha
---
My 2 caps worth of suggestions:
---
* Half wide vertical walls
---
* 90 deg. stairs on a single full sized floor section (half up, half turn),
---
* Fix blueprints, if I can build it and BP it I should never encounter the item is floating bug
---
It does. You may have to do it a few times but you'll get them.
---
I'm just gonna drop them off at the Morgantown rain station
---
It's not about purpose.  They removed NPC's because the "purpose" was to interact with players, but the problem then and now is the servers are so dead you can play for hours and never run into anyone.  It's about quality of life improvements that a global chat would actually allow people to communicate and meet up and work with other people on things, something that's literally never happened in my 100+ hours in the game.
---
Point taken. The story line is kinda disjointed for me as a result.
---
Is it just me or this reddit profile keeps posting only negative threads / comments?
---
Online games require patches, maintenance, and those things require people to do them. No other game does this for free. 
---
Bethesda promised DLC would be free, they never once said there wouldn't be a subscription, or other features that would cost money. 
---
Never said it made me better than anyone. I'm just pointing out that unless you are/were willing to support the game by making purchases (even $10 a month probably would have stopped this from happening), then you are the direct cause of the change in the monetization method. 
---
Don't be mad, and don't act like YOU are some how a better person for expecting other people to give you shit for free. That's not how life works. Get a job, or a better one. Maybe then you can afford to give a damn.
---
That'd be a good location I believe there's a vault or two up there
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm3kqn/mischief_event_rewards/
---
I believe I saw a thread like this, on same topic. Ppl were clearly responding in manner "to each his own taste" by majority.
---
Yeah! Could have some good story lines with the Canadians resisting the American take over. 
---
Ronto (Toronto) has been mentioned in previous games also
---
New York, either the city or around the upstate area.
---
No, you’re right, it sucks.
---
That quest has been bugged for me for months.  I've done all the steps up to waiting after submitting the sample and it just never completes.  The title of the quest is there but there are no tasks under it.  I try it out about once every two weeks but ignore it most of the time.
---
Neat, what else have you found?
---
Awesome, thanks everybody!
---
(On PC) I ran into someones camp that was almost like a floating boathouse with the neon sign "best prices on the lake"  i was impressed and took a picture, a few months passed and i found it again by chance yesterday i took another picture and it was nice to see the changes he/she made to it
---
Is it just me or is this reddit profile stalking me?
---
Steals from JuiceHead, changes the facts to suit his bias. Love it.
---
\*cackles\* Your smart-assery fills my heart with joy. Qapla'! (Yeah, I had to look up how to spell that...)
---
the game was a copy and paste from fallout 4
---
They knew what they were releasing and still didnt care enough to use the fixes from the creation club
---
not sure why you think i want to support really bad excuses with money and assume it will have a good outcome when they lie and take advantage of player feedback as marketing ideas
---
My bad! I'll get some screenshots of the hospital later today and put 'em up. It ain't much, but it's my home.
---
Sadly, she's on PS4.
---
Its a damn good sub it just needs content to really back it up like eso has, even to this day the vanilla content still wipes the floor in how much there is compared to 76.
---
Too hard and not enough people generally .. was good but you need too many people to be successful but if you have a group that likes a challenge, probably the hardest fight in the game. Also lots of people especially new people don't know what to do .. there are better and easier events, but it was fun while it lasted.
---
Probably to make the odds harder on the rest of the new ones.
---
I didn't even know there was a vampire effect on weapons, I've never seen it.  Sounds good if I ever find one.
---
And they add private play sessions to in affect making it even less MMO
---
What place is this?
---
I'm enjoying your series.
---
I grew up near the New River Gorge.  I remember when the bridge was first finished!  It made a huge difference in the area as far as traversing the gorge.  Shaved a lot of time off of that.  But more importantly, it brought a tourism economy to the area.  Now people go there for the bridge, whitewater rafting, etc.  
---
Crossing that bridge made it accessible to do Summersville as a fairly quick trip.  We spent summers there at the lake when I as a kid.  Fun times.
---
I'm slowly photographing my own series around the state with my NPC companion --&gt;  https://imgur.com/a/JtiOpCs
---
 Fallout 76 has brought me countless hours of entertainment...  
---
And I never even bought the game! 
---
I would love to see how they will fight this one
---
more examples of how theyre fucking up good games?
---
iirc, the way it is implemented now, you wouldnt be able to invite people to your session, per se. Anyone on your friends list who sees you online can join on  your character and be in your session
---
I like it! Has a very constructor feel to it . Hoping its a reward for getting good rep with em.
---
Seattle??? Sawant (Socialist city council members) would be protesting it...lol
---
They're far from dead on PC for me.
---
Yea I had this happen to me already &lt;w&gt;
---
No, because the pumpkins you get don't light up and the amount of crashes I've gotten towards the ending. Other than that, I like the idea. Just wish the pumpkins could light up when you make them
---
It looks bad if you played New Vegas and expected that level of detail. FO76 looks like a Halloween costume IMHO.
---
&gt; done a couple places on the map for different difficulty levels!
---
It occurred to me last night that the way they did Meat Week was better for that very reason.  Having the combat events spread out across the map for different levels helped make sure that more people participated in that part of it.  The actual cookout had plenty of things for everyone to do since it wasn't combat related.
---
Go where you want, do what you want. With 16 times the detail
---
&gt; They are just now correcting that with the subscription
---
That is the dumbest shit I've ever heard. 
---
We made a busted ass game, you bought it, and now we need to you pay to make it the game we told you it would be.
---
No, I just noticed your username being present in many thread, spewing negativity everywhere, without any constructive feedback. Get a life man.
---
It is also important to note that anyone given a refund will forfeit their account.  I don't see anyone mentioning that and if someone has continued to play, a very important piece of info!
---
That's because there isn't really "rare" items. From what Juicehead said, there's a few tiers. If you wear a outfit, you get an extra reward. I wish there was something rare but eh
---
Consider it lucky... I have only gotten plans for regular items and a witches hat...lol
---
Yikes BGS
---
Remember, this is in Australia so they are called whingers.
---
&gt;Cool! Is it part of the event or something?
---
It was added back when they were teasing the sheepsquatch and the quest line for the imposter.
---
I’d sooner die
---
I liked mayhem at whitesprings the first time when we called it a Nuke zone. Seems almost the same as many times the area was nuked. Pleanty of robot fights took place
---
Bethesda knows what they're doing and it's wrong
---
Pete Hines says one thing then another happens, then says everything will be cosmetic only but now they're selling useful in game items like the scrap collector, repair kits, scrap kits etc it's all BS 
---
Todd Howard talks about 16x the details and how it just works but it doesn't, the game and graphics look garbage compared to what the standard in 2019 is and the servers are as of late crashing periodically and disconnecting. 
---
It's now clear to me they were always going to go down the money grubbing route and it's happened
---
If they want people to play their game and actually pay for a subscription maybe they should actually fix the game and ensure it's playable and in working order first
---
Also maybe it would help if they actually bothered to update their game engine instead of relying on an outdated engine that doesn't work anymore, I can almost guarantee they'll use the same crappy engine for elder scrolls VI and find a way to screw players over with that.
---
If you want to support a shoddy company with your abundance of cash go right ahead it's your money and I frankly couldn't care how you spend it but I refuse to ever support bgs again
---
Yeah maybe if I got rid of pack rat to max out gladiator/expert gladiator/master gladiator, get rid of sunkissed and bring 1 point from Endurance to Perception to get Grenadier, get rid of Thru-hiker and Goat Legs to get Adrenaline, and replace junk shield with bloody mess that'd be a lot better. Damage would go way up, carry capacity would go way down, but that's alright, especially with a scrapbox. Damage resistance would go down noticeably without junk shield, but more damage is probably better. I think probably demolitions expert is better than nerd rage, I use a m79 when I absolutely need to shoot something at range and grenades are also pretty good for a melee character. If I did a lot of PvP nerd rage would probably be better, but I'm rarely at 20% health and wouldn't want to risk it
---
HA, Funny. 
---
PROUD to say I haven't bought the subscription and have been walking to every location since launch because I'm over weight in weapons and junk.....
---
Thanks for your thoughts
---
Good for you, mate. Hopefully US and EU pay notice to increasingly shady behaviour by companies like Zenimax.
---
To be fair, repair kits exist outside of the atom shop in the form of improved repair kits which is why I don't care that we can buy shitty ones, the scrap bot just allows you to worry even less about scrap which I like, and fallout first just adds to that because you have an unlimited scrap storage, also I don't own F1st or the scrap bot but I was a regular buyer of the normal repair kits especially in the middle of an event or quest.
---
I like it, but much like how the best of this game's community gives it the best rep, the worst also ruins it for everyone else. People who speed ahead of the event progress and blow up all the cars in the next area, so they don't count when the event progress finally catches up. Or people who instant kill the legendary spawn, so it doesn't drop a legendary. Or people who nuke the zone.
---
At this point what are they going to say? And if they said anything, would it matter?
---
0, just drop them...
---
The troll s don't care about that though!
---
I’ve been buying Atoms. I also bought the game on two different platforms. Once at full price then two more times at the discount (one for me and my friend). I’ve bought atom bundles three times and have been waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and the game STILL is a dumpster fire. I’m PISSED. I will most likely not buy another Bethesda product. They have totally eroded my trust with this game and their tactics.
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
Alaska
---
they got a community that will pay them money regardless, so why would they ever spend money to fix things? They could put an in game rock that did nothing but ask you for 6 dollars and a bunch of useful idiots would 'donate"
---
So the people who spent money can get their items replaced? Bet that makes everyone else feel good all those times that things were lost.
---
\&gt;They knew what they were releasing and still didnt care enough to use the fixes from the creation club
---
did u not read???
---
Most of ALL the bugs and general features the game is missing have been fixed by modders
---
Bethfesda would be losing the money for using thoses fixes because they DONT want to share profits
---
God Bethesda have turned into awful shite altogether.
---
Honestly I think a lot of people just don't understand how the event works. I've been there with 10 other players and people still won't activate the pylons. Have failed the event several times because of this. This event has probably also bankrupted me of stimpaks more than anything else in the game.
---
Thanks. I’m blind clearly
---
I just had the same experience. I signed on to this three-ringed circus fairly early on, so I didn't think people really still gave new people stuff anymore. Maybe now and again, but not on the regular.
---
In six levels, I had three level 100+ walk up to me and hand me stuff. Sometimes it was weapons, sometimes aid or armour. I didn't have my mic on and haven't moved anything between toons yet, so the best I could do was a heart emoji. Another guy came and helped me clear out some location. I'm so glad this community keeps doing this stuff!
---
They could weave that into the lore somehow
---
It is painful to do it. Most people don't want to become the conduit because they don't know or are bloodied and would die instantly. Also starting the event is kind of expensive.
---
The Imposter is tough and hits really hard (afaik, there is a bug that its attacks completely ignore armor). Imagine you have to be all 3 conduit and often you are getting aggroed by it all the time because nobody else wants to keep it busy. I heard a full set of Troubleshooter armor works great for it (it works fantastic for the WS and Silo robots) but I haven't had the opportunity to try it out yet.
---
Games these days aren't built to last, they're built to take your money as quickly as possible.
---
Bethesda sold out a long while ago. The once great company is now more concerned with profits and selling flashy products than it is about building fun games.
---
In other words, they really could care less about you. They haven't in some time.
---
We were farming it before the Halloween event but took a break for this I imagine alot if people are currently doing the same.
---
It's real, VERY popular locally. Any given night and the line stretches for blocks. Its definitely worth a check out they do tons of crazy stuff with pumpkins. My Diffrential Equations professor at marshall helps run it.
---
All things cost money. Continuing development and fixing things cost money and they are not running a charity. Everything has overhead, so they have to cover those costs somehow.
---
Actually, as someone who was refunded and in Australia, we were entitiled to a refund for most any reason, including, but not limited to;
---
damaged product, false advertising etc. I'm not sure if dissatisfaction is included, but my refund was given on grounds that Bethesda refused my refund, that I had a right to due to what I said was a disfunctional game and was indeed based on lies (the "only cosmetics, we promis" among countless others), ACCC ruled that a consumer has the right to their money back, replacement or credit. Key part, we decide the resolution, not the company. Bethesda initially refused my refund because, as they said; "Anyone who purchased the game digitally is not entitled to a refund."  
---
So the lie they were tripped on, was most likely the last part, about not being entitled to a refund. Though it could have been their refusal in general, as in AUS we are ALWAYS granted a refund under reasonable conditions. Steam was forced to offer refunds a while back over something not too different, they were nearly blacklisted from doing business in AUS, they backed down.
---
unfortunately I’ve spent about $30 to buy atoms so I could unlock power armor skins. Do I regret it...yes. I’m still deciding if I even wanna log on to  play the Halloween event or play more Outer worlds. With Bethesda being greedy I’m starting to think I should of used that money I spent on atom to buy outer worlds. Currently playing it for $1 on Xbox game pass so it’s not too bad.
---
Miss the days when Bethesda  care about gamers and not another cash grab. I would have happily paid another 100 bucks to be able to finally actually own this game , but this paywall cash grab lets your diehard fans down.
---
So you are making demands of a company- YOU with the fact they are now taking OTHER people’s money. 
---
Like you won’t pay your self but you’ll make the demands.
---
Wow
---
So you'll just keep reposting this every 10 minutes until someone cares?
---
If that's the look the settlers have chosen then I am going raider all the way. Lol. 
---
Thanks for the sneak peek. I'm curious to see what comes of it months from now when we get to meet these settlers.
---
Sorry that you feel the need to insult me because to defend your precious vidya, bro.
---
Hey, it's just a game, okay? You will get over it!
---
I think it looks fine. Toss the helmet, put on some cop shades and a red bandana and you’re good to go.
---
Thanks, I'm actually as happy now as I used to be when hearing of a new Bethesda title like Fallout or TES coming out. Though that now makes me sad, thinking that.
---
Would be great if Canada could jump on this train.  I ordered the PA Edition, I'd be curious to see how much I'd get back for this joke.
---
Right now my damage resistance is higher than ultracite or x-01 armor and without junk shield it wouldn't be, but still more damage is probably better
---
What system are you on? I have a few I could part with one
---
SO you think its great for companies to monitize childrens games with mircotransactions because they're easy prey?
---
its WORSE they make money on KNOWN facts like yours.
---
WDYM by more toxic than NJ😂
---
Degenerates like you belong on a *cross*
---
I posted once. I was told it was deleted for it's title? So I made corrections. Get over it.
---
It looks decent, but I don’t think any paint jobs for the T-51b will ever look as good as the Tricentennial, Blackbird, or Nukashine ones.
---
It even is poorly optimized on pc.
---
I feel the same with the ranger outfit.  Doesn't seem like care was put into it.
---
I'm not being white knight. Fo76 has so many flaws....
---
But ppl like you ruin this subreddit.
---
Btw, this comment, assuming my stance and going passively agressive........ah, no point, im out.
---
Make a alcoholic drink, Shroud Tonic.
---
Gives the player night status but sets your DR to 0 for 5 minutes.
---
Actually I saw that and edited. You can be salty or build a bridge and get over it.
---
Uh-huh. Tell me more, please.
---
Yeah, I think the helmet is what ruins it.
---
I just won the lottery tho
---
heads up.
---
Your comment can be written in a personal journal and have the same affect.
---
please reframe from posting comments just for the sake of arguing
---
Yeah, totally the people's fault. The game was good at launch already btw, it's just a portion of people who ranted on Reddit and Youtube who made it hated. Since that (and before that too) Bethesda was forced to lie again and again.
---
Needs to be call falloutfist
---
I had someone go into my garage one time and close the door on me and emote.
---
So I removed the wire from the outside and left him in there. He emoted for about 5 mins while I listened to him flick the switch on and off lmao.
---
After that he fast traveled away but i’ll take it as a win.
---
Same, I said sorry. I always get defensive on this sub, I'm used to being attacked for having a different opinion. Let's just end it there.
---
Nah I’m good I’m going to keep commenting thanks!
---
That’s awesome!
---
Somewhere in the southwest area. Texas would be cool. Or, even though it was already in Fallout 1, the Kern Country area of California. I’m sure that with either of those locations, they could tie in with the major oil fields. Maybe have some ghouls telling stories from before the war about the resource wars and how quickly they lost their jobs when the wells dried up.
---
Consider where previous iterations and expansion packs have taken place....and whether they want to avoid placed used in other games (recall Seattle area was used in infamous)
---
Main games:  WV, DC, MD, CA, NV, MA and nearby areas have already been used ... 
---
Expansion packs eliminate: AK, ME, parts of PA.
---
Where else in the country has a target rich environments for nukes?
---
SE VA and parts of NC fit the description.  Area 51 and Norad offer some interesting possibilities.  (Would blackrock? would be considered to similar to norad.)  
---
PA into TN (because of some of the gov't research facilities, but rolling mountains and small population centers might be too similar to WV.  Same problem with Canada)
---
OTOH, purely for strange critter mutations (from rads and FEV) southern FL could be crazy.
---
Yep, if I were still playing I would literally remove everyone on my friends list except for like 3-4 people. That also needs to change, seems silly.
---
sure try :D
---
What’s the reward for mischief event? I did it once and didn’t get anything other than a one star flamer from the one star sentry bot.
---
Don’t need your permission thanks💘
---
Works for me friend 🖒
---
Don't worry! They'll add it now! you'll just need to subscribe to fallout 1st to be able to use it
---
So now you don’t have the game and won’t be playing anymore... so I guess this is a good bye and good luck for you then eh.
---
I'm seeing more bloodied as well.  RNGesus granted me like 3 in 6 months before I decided to do a bloodied build, last 3 weeks I've pulled like 8.  No godrolls, mostly 1 stars but still.  Same with explosive.
---
Yes but having another way instead of only one way to pick it. i want choices we got one way to open a terminal and we got one way to open safes or doors
---
This nightmare beats out any of them that we heard about and seen on Elm Street. Holy fucking shitballs...it literally is neverending at this point.
---
im calling it now, the argument of cosmetics being locked behind a paywall they will either say sorry we listened but want to give something to subs but still release the data mined other colours or theyll say sorry we listened and say that the will release only recolours or changes to fo1st subs
---
Never knew this was a issue, I know people are mad about the lack of replies/communication but this is kinda weird. I guess they just think it’ll hurt Bethesda’s karma. Too late, they lost it a while ago hahahaha.... I’m hilarious. Really though it’s a childish move. You can always PM them and they’ll usually give back a reply if it’s done in the right manner.
---
Or Nothern Lights 
---
Jingle Bells, man! Jingle Bells!
---
How many you have? Maybe one of them is not currently working? In typical tech support case, you already know what the problem is.
---
I can only say my 
---
sResourceArchive2List = LockpickingBar.ba2, ore_glow.ba2, GbnbMAIN.ba2, GbnbTXTR.ba2, UHDmap.ba2, EventNotifications.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2
---
works fine.
---
&gt; i don't get the user/password page
---
Well you shouldn't, as when you start the game with launcher, it logs you on automatically.
---
I'm just happy that they gave me my money back, even if they had to be forced to do so. I actually stopped playing LONG ago and was rather upset that a company I used to love so much would turn around and refuse to do the right thing.   
---
Whatever your think about the game, you have to admit that it's wrong to refuse a refund, especially for no reason.
---
The helmet definitely does. I *wanted* to wear a football helmet with the outfit, like the Legion, but I fucked up and didn’t get it from the atomic shop. So, loss on that part, but it’s still good looking with a bandana and shades imo.
---
By killing those high level mobs so you get top XP. Invest into armor penetrating magazines and shoot them in the head while avoiding more than 2 mobs at a time. Also learn armor mods (leather is cheap to grind through) and buff up your DR.
---
Just bring back survival or make survival more interesting so more people will play it. Damn griefers.
---
Yeah lmao they all started attacking me too. Luckily most of the ones attacking me were low leveled
---
Holy shit I would have run away lol
---
Riot Gear? Did I miss somthing?
---
So you haven’t played this game in a long time and you still come and post here to whine about it? This is a sub for a game you don’t even play anymore. You coming to whine about a game that we still enjoy (that you don’t even play) is just annoying. 
---
Maybe just move on.
---
I could see that! That would be a classic! Haha!
---
They also reliably check this sub and charge us for the very ideas that we helped them come up with.
---
I’ve locked people in- they just fast travel out
---
Chill out, I'm here saying that "yay, I finally got this refund" Maybe other people who live in Australia will see this and think "Huh, good to know." But, sure I guess me being happy about a refund is exactly the same as complaining about the game.  
---
Did you read my comment? You like the game? That's cool, good on you. I didn't, but it was about MORE that THAT. Bethesda refused to do the right thing, but now are doing so. But only after Government pressure from the ACCC. That qualifies as 'News' as the tag indicates my friend. So calm down.
---
Is he whining? Seemed like just sharing info to me.
---
Nice thing about seattle and the PNW is there’s a variety of environments - coastal, urban, suburban, normal forest, rainforest, mountain, desert, glacier, volcano. Get some Rad-Sasquatches and Rad-Orcas in the lore, some side quests with an evil corporation based on AMZ/MSFT and one with an evil military contractor based on Boeing. After the inevitable Olympic Peninsula DLC starts, some vampire content out there and some Easter eggs with references to “An Officer and a Gentleman” to find while exploring Fort Worden.
---
Awesome!!   Now get off of Reddit...you no longer play...no one cares...adios!!!   Crybabies because they don't like the game.....I have played plenty of shitty games but never thought about asking for a refund....  To me it is absolute unreal that they gave a refund and your government actually has time to worry about stupid shit like video games....
---
It's an interesting way to do an event, but it's pretty tedious and frustrating. They need to scale back the amount of damage it does and how much health is drained from the pylons. Constantly slamming stimpacks isn't fun.
---
I would prefer they break the fight into stages rather then make it a big tank battle. 3 people take pylons, imposter de-cloaks, they shoot until it hits half health, it automatically re-cloaks and refills it's health to full and the pylons shut down. Maybe then you have to collect 3 spare parts from the robot mobs. Repair the pylons with the parts and pair with them again, imposter decloaks, you kill it.
---
I'm really enjoying it. I had a rough go at it last night - finally had one of those infamous crashes on Xbox One - but it was a good time. Finally got my Pumpkin Pant Suit. Just need the pirate suit and reaper cut out and I'm good.
---
I should add, it crashed once out of 4 times doing the event last night. I also did it around 4pm, and it was smooth as silk with literally 16 people there. I just got caught too close to an explosion on the one that crashed on me.
---
You asked for an explanation in your post about downvotes- now you are whining and arguing about the explanation.
---
Don’t ask questions you do not want answers to.
---
I got downvoted for pointing this out, lol
---
I think the point is you're arguing against a feature that doesn't hurt you in the slightest if you don't want to use it.  You may think it's fine, lots of people don't and it's one of the main reasons this game didn't sell or get played nearly as expected.  Then we've got knuckleheads on these forums arguing against features based on some kind of puritanical bullshit that are really just putting another nail in the coffin.
---
Yeah I expected him to do that but I guess because he was such a low level he either not understand he could or didn't had the caps to could.
---
The thing that got me was that he saw me building the cell.
---
This is why I no longer play on PC.
---
Thankfully very few people, if any, hack on PS4.
---
At least nothing this freaking obvious.
---
&gt;Everything has overhead, so they have to cover those costs somehow.
---
I understand that, but Bethesda released a shitty mess by their own actions, not the players. And now you're saying the players need to be the ones to pay to fix it after already paying for the game in the first place. 
---
Bethesda has many means to fund FO76 outside of Fallout 1st, unless they've deemed it not worth it. I'm just really confused why the community needs to take responsibility for their failures and not Bethesda themselves?
---
Sorry, I missed that part, I saw it pop up in the corner of reddit, it obviously didn't dhow the whole thing.
---
You didn’t even include the link in your post to share the information.
---
Even 1* is better than what I was getting previously.
---
Would help if he Included the link to share info eh? This is just rambling.
---
I found textures for variants of floaters (no model yet), animatronics from Nuka World coming in the latest patch and some mutilated deathclaws that may be in an up and coming quest.
---
Well, true, but some people pay money for skins and add-ons to try and make a game that sucks better.
---
Yeah, it's way too much work for what you get.
---
Are you actually serious? You never ask for a refund for anything? Or just games? Because you're wasting money either way, especially when games cost hundreds (FYI this game, the base game, cost $100 in AUS) The government here cares because otherwise, companies walk all over you.   
---
How is a government standing up for the rights of its people a bad thing?
---
Like my Johnny. For the one they caaaaall Johnny Guitaaaa-aaaar!!
---
Possibly but subscription makes more money in the long run especially if they offer exclusive content and feature. The f2p market is allready overloaded with better games. Fortnite has pretty much cornered that market.  Honestly There biggest money source is going to be the rpg fans and hardcore fallout fans. The ones that eat, sleep and breath fallout. 
---
 
---
Subscription or f2p either way Bethesda is still going to bleed the game dry and its sad to see because it really is a fantastic game when it works right.
---
Its like they dont care anymore...I submitted 3 tickets, no reply back
---
yeah i have lost faith after fallout1st. 
---
not sure how they thought making an online game even more segergated was the best PR move.
---
Do you need to shell out for Fallout 1st to do that or can I just do that with my regular Fallout 76?
---
Woah man you want the game you paid for the be playable? What’s next?
---
Someone is angry
---
Yeah, it's either on cooldown for a few seconds, or the event has moved onto the next area. They are only available in the 2nd area with the houses and the final area in the courtyard, when the event is in one of those two zones. If the event is not current in one of those areas, the candy bowls will not be interactable.
---
Meaning:
---
* If the event is in phase one (light bonfires, blow up cars) then no Trick-or-Treat bowls are available.
---
* If the event is in phase two (blow up cars, graffiti houses, trick-or-treat) then the bowls in that section - the houses locked by hand sensor pads - are available. The ones in the courtyard are locked.
---
* If the event is in phase three (fork the yard, trick-or-treat, etc) then the bowls in the courtyard section are open, and the ones by the houses are locked.
---
Because I have all the outfits and plans that drop.
---
What, for the ACCC? If people in AUS don't know what that is, they have bigger issues. But I see your point.
---
yeah me and my friends play on PC we get a large amount of laag but its mostly spikes for 30 secs when a ton of cars get nuked at the same time then it goes away
---
Most people now do encrypted and queen runs in private servers
---
I also hated Butcher Pete. But I always sat it out until it was done. Everything else from Galaxy News Radio was amazing. And I can't think of anything else from 4 I didn't like. And now... IT'S BACK! WHY IS IT BACK?!
---
That sounds like an amazing idea. For the workers striking it could be based in logging
---
Idiots were begging for additions to the Atom Store long before the subscription.
---
I don't use the launcher, apart from update days. I log in with different accounts on different machines (my boys take it in turns using the bad gaming laptop or the slightly less bad gaming pc, so i have to swap over what i log in with).  
---
That was the problem, my 2List entry still had all the game files (the texture and enlighten stuff) which was counting towards the number of mods. I deleted the game file stuff and it burst back into life.  
---
A link to what? He got a refund. A lot of people have been asking for refunds. He was sharing the information that he got a refund. You need a link for that? If your gonna troll at least put some effort into it.
---
This lawsuit yes I understand it has nothing to do with the atom store. My comment was more geared towards getting the lawsuits to go after the subscription next. It sets a dangerous idea when game controls can be locked behind a yearly pay wall.
---
In a year, this piece of shit will be dead. People arent going to buy a sub in numbers sufficient to support it.
---
The engine is 20 years old. Its stiff, dated, archaic and bug ridden, with bugs tied so closely to the code base theres no fixing it now.
---
This game is dead man walking. Why do you think they're squeezing the whales so hard now?
---
Cool, thanks for the updates.
---
Love all the Flatwoods Monster stuff.
---
Good mentality bro, just give up, nothing works... Spread awareness then, do something more productive then giving up. If there is enough backlash towards some scummy garbage companies like Bethesda it will result in interest from mainstream media which could have a much further reach.
---
Despite the recent backlash this game has received, I’m excited to see what’s coming.
---
It's only suspicious if you don't get people aren't just trashing FO76 to be "trolls". It's because a lot of fans were extremely disappointed and took a lot of heat from friends for even giving this game a shot. There have been multiple times within FO76s life that Bethesda has completely lied and taken advantage of fans good will. 
---
So it's not suspicious. Fans are just really pissed and disappointed.
---
I've seen videos of very high level aimbotters, which means they basically go unchecked despite (possibly numerous) reports.
---
Hopw long did you wait? When I bought atoms there was a notice that told me that they should show after 15 minutes (though it worked immediately), and that if they still weren't there, I should get in touch with customer support.
---
It's just too much of a hassle to me, rewards are cool and all but once you get the outfits it's done.
---
No but people just flately made shit up.  Just to stoke the fires.  And there are plenty of videos on that.  Then people interjected words that weren’t there such as “free” when referring to private servers.  Neither Todd nor Pete nor anyone else said anything of the sort. They said private servers was something they would “consider”.  
---
This isn’t to say that all the criticisms aren’t warranted. Game stability is a major valid complaint.  But people getting angry that looked like Fallout 4 when they told you it was built on Fallout 4s structure is just naive.  But it crashing repeatedly because it’s built on Fallout 4s coding is a valid concern because, well, regardless of source code it shouldn’t do that.  
---
The problem I have with the mob is that for every one valid complaint there are more that are preferences to that particular user. Or questionable in their authenticity.  What the exact ratio is I can’t tell because it’s all over the damn place.  
---
So when faced with a rabid fan base that misunderstands, misuses, or, in some cases flat out lies, about the conditions experienced in game, I wouldn’t say shit either.  I’d just put it out there and let the angry peeps be angry and let those who enjoy it, enjoy it.
---
Well I can’t say I’ve uninstalled the game cause I just might pick it back up. But I’m so sorry for your struggles. I wouldn’t know, cause I didn’t put it in for a couple of months. And after hearing about fallout 1st, I will definitely let more dust collect on the game, until Bethesda put out the new dlc
---
The sub-bases on the Kitsap peninsula would be great targets for the Chinese to target in game
---
I bought them last night
---
You complaining is even worse. Let him live for Christ’s sake.
---
Don't give them your damn money!
---
Well you can do all three conduits and just run down the hill. You can actually keep running as far away as you want and you won’t leave the event.  So conduits, if not attacking, can get to a place where they will never get shot.  Then maybe have 20-30 stimpaks and some purified water and your good to go.  I’ve done it this way with just one other person in the event.
---
Clothing and camp decorations
---
See - my experience so far is "run around like a chicken with my head cut off while I try to find something, anything, I can interact with that seems to match those 'goals' in the top right corner".  Blowing up cars makes sense - I can do that. I've never found anything else I can do, no matter what phase we're currently in. Even the bonfires don't work for me - I can see "press A to light" but pressing A doesn't appear to do anything. "fork the yard", "graffiti houses", "trick-or-treat" - I've never seen anything that'll do any of those.
---
This is meat week all over again - I only ever played the drums in that event because I couldn't figure out what the hell I was supposed to be doing otherwise.
---
Exclusively for fallout 1st members
---
Xbox here. Fallout First sinner as well. PM your Xbox name. 😉
---
Paid DLC I am more than happy to pay for. More than fucking happy. Private, fast travel, storage horse shit they can kiss my ass. 
---
I would have happily paid $60 for 4 DLC’s throughout a year. 
---
$180 AUD for nothing a year, no thanks.
---
No.
---
Eh, a lot of it is just directed from people who no longer play the game, Fallout 1st only has 2 slightly P2W aspects that don't really affect the game harshly in my opinion. The worth of the cosmetics alone is fine for the 13.99$, not to forget that  you can just cancel it.
---
See, that's where you wrong; PvP in adventure really isn't about numbers - except as in team of more vs team of less. But you do need gear, build and mindset...
---
Pittsburg dlc for fallout 3? Was awesome
---
?
---
ABSOLUTELY!
---
Wow, the whole $60 and it only took a year!
---
The article the 100 other posts have on this
---
Putting it as a sticky when it's already the top non-sticky post on the subreddit will actually reduce it's overall visibility for folks who aren't visiting the subreddit, due to ways the overall reddit algorithm treats sticky posts.
---
Given the narrow target audience of the post, making it a sticky would be a great disservice. As such, we decline to do so, for the best interest of the Australians who may benefit from this ruling.
---
Be careful what you wish for.  This has set a precedent that will likely ensure that Australia will be considered when game companies decide to roll out new games.  Expectations about how a game should perform are subjective.  Unpredictable Australia will enter a gaming drought.  Enjoy!
---
I’m glad you got a refund. That said, I think overall it’s very weird how the AU law treats online services as products, since the whole idea of the service model it that it can and will change.
---
IMHO, it leaves me *somewhat* worried for the future of the game but will continue playing the game. It’s not my place to be critical unless this directly affects me, and it does not.
---
but not immediately! give me time to stash my flux please
---
Another thing that makes me mad. The ending elite robot gives me 250 ish xp, but a regular sentry gives me about 600 xp. Which just doesn't make sense to me
---
Thanks that’s good to know! 👍🏻
---
Your username checks out.
---
Where is this? If you don’t mind me asking
---
I don't think internet speed is the main issue.   I'm on a 300 Mbps wired fiber connection and still freeze or blue screen crash at least once per session if not more on 76.  I've never had this many issues with other online games.
---
Crazy people, as they have been before.
---
Turns out you nailed it with this post lol
---
Please Give us more enclave content in general!!
---
Common sense doesn't work on stupid people.
---
Urban and forest scout definitely need skins. Mainly so that I'll be safe from accidentally scripping or selling it.
---
Agreed.
---
But it doesnt excuse the fact the game devs and company aren't utilizing know fixes done by die-hardcore fans that have fixed many problems currently going on.
---
A stash box that looks like the Fo3 Enclave Crates!
---
The court just ruled that a world wide company has to follow the consumer rights of a country they sell a product in... and your seeing that as a bad thing? The UK, USA and Europe actually have the same consumer rights act ZeiMax has simply been told in Australia they cannot get away with ignoring those rights.
---
Thanks but It’s pure business... they have a successful product that has gotten better with ESO. So I for one am hopeful in the future with Fallout!
---
This is graphic detail only sir if you want game detail we have a $19.99 monthly fee for the next 4 years that will help pay to outsource the next fallout then not pay the company who made it over deadlines and bankrupt them.
---
Most of it usually comes from Zenimax, pretty sure Juicehead made a prediction on why Bethesda has been changing their business practices recently, quite interesting. Overall I don't really care seeing as I enjoy the game either way.
---
It's been ok for me, but I've gotten like 5 whitespring jumpsuits out of it 😥
---
Crashes and events bugging out are the reason I don’t put time in this game anymore. I’ll get the itch to play, then less than five minutes into my session it’ll crash or an event will bug out and I lose all motivation to try anymore
---
I see a lot of Big iron, and johnny guitar love here which they're good songs but who can forget HEARTACHES BY THE NUMBER, TROUBLES BY THE SCORE, EVERYDAY YOU LOVE ME LESS, EACH DAY I LOVE YOU MORE.
---
Well, I’m sure crashing is very annoying.  I would not know.  There is no one ever on in the PC version to do the event.  The game is a ghost town.  The only social interaction I’ve had recently was with some jackass named ROKU_TV, who kept attacking me hoping I’d retaliate so he could gank me.  I know how to report idiots now, so I’m hoping I run to run into him again soon.
---
These events suck “go sow mischief in the park” is more like “go sow your e button all over campfires cause nobody wants the whitesprings robots to be hostile” speaking of which, the whitesprings robots turn hostile after the event if you attack them so if you want to do the event fast you have to leave the server afterwards. They ruined the rarity of two items (gilded clock and whitesprings jumpsuit) instead of making new cosmetics and plans. The event can literally give you a 10 lbs vase, the suits are reskins. The only new camp items are a cardboard cutout which I’ll never use and a bunch of pumpkins that I can’t even place since they all require me to carry a 2 lbs pumpkin to make as well as the amount of budget they take up. The cosmetics they did add should’ve been in the game in the first place (fireman’s uniform, pirate costume) and the suit is again, just a reskin so it’s not even new. Private servers P2W it by making it so you can get infinite rewards due to a bug Bethesda won’t fix until 3 years from now. Then after all that I’ll still get downvoted to hell because I don’t approve of people who don’t pay money only getting 168 rewards as their compensation for having 0 sleep and not doing anything for a week. This as well as the nuclear winter challenges make it impossible to get all the rewards possible without struggling for time in between every 30 minute nuclear winter match. In conclusion, the event fucking sucks.
---
\*$100 actually, this game (as well as most) is more expensive over here in AUS. But that's just the base game, lord help those who paid $200 or more for the other editions.
---
Omg this post is amazing
---
Colonel Kelly monument
---
Seriously, Sub titles need to be way bigger in ALL video games. And color graded to and shadowboxed.
---
Don’t confuse the drama queens who like to spout off like I’ll informed tools with the facts!
---
Sickkk. I'm gonna see if I can get a mod made this weekend. I know a lot of people will be glad to change their menu back :)
---
Playing on Xbox One OG Crashes every time. The ONLY way I get to finish Mischief Night, is to;
---
1: Fast Travel to the WS courtyard IMMEDIATELY when the event starts.
---
2: Force quit
---
3: Open the Home Menu , Go to recent players.
---
4: Hope there is a player, that was on that server appearing online (look for Gamertags with green dots last seen under 10 minutes ago) &amp; join their game.
---
5: Since you fast traveled to the WS Courtyard rather than joining the event, you are now positioned to stare at the loading screen forever, but usually load just in time to trick or treat the courtyard before the event ends. You do not have rejoin, just be in the courtyard when JES shows up and you auto, join.
---
The only other option is to get a friend in group, force quit and rejoin right away, each time it starts.
---
I have almost gotten all of the event patterns doing it this way...
---
It SUCKS... but it works
---
In the end, it was the crashing that got me to quit. I disliked other things about the game, but tried to power through it like I usually do. I loved building shit and exploring. But i would play and lose lots of work often. I couldn't even use any workshop because there was no point.
---
Bethesda denied my refund request shortly after release for the reason "you downloaded it"
---
What kind of bullshit is that
---
That'll be 40$
---
CHOPPIN THAT MEAT
---
Well, it is a GOOD, it's classed as a good still and I like that. A product is being sold. This "games as a servise" push, I think, was made for exactly what you just said. To try and turn games, legally, into a service, rather than a good. So that they can avoid laws that protect peoples right to a refund.   
---
Take into account that, at least in Australia, any online game is still a good. Physically purchased or otherwise, it is still considered a good and affords you far more rights that a service.
---
I don't want to fan the flames but it was datamined there will be one for Falllout 1st subscribers
---
Yea and the shoes clip through my skin
---
I mean, Home girl was replying to stuff yesterday.
---
Oh shit...i would love a refund...so much hope for this game such a shame...
---
Got a link to it? Or video ?
---
You really have nothing better to do than try, lamely, to antagonize these fanboys you have defined in your head?  Sounds like you need a girlfriend.  If you already have one, and you’re still here trolling, then maybe you need to trade up.
---
I can confirm this is the case. I don't know the time limit but it worked at least 5 minutes out for me
---
Yea, what they said. If you wear a costume it gives better rewards. You are not guaranteed Clothing AND Plans, it can be a mixture of the two. I had 3 plans and no clothing, other times I have received 2 clothing items and no plans.
---
Yes and no on one hand its new on the other hand once an hour is slow for somethin thats only 5 mins if it was more frequent itd be better
---
I have a similar camp for one of my characters. It's just up to you to get there first. I don't blame people for using their tents that way: it makes sense. And the roof is a good spot to fight from. Phuck the bloodied builds who reduce the time for fighting the queen to a minute or two, so some people do not arrive in time for a piece of the action, and there is NO opportunity for other, better (sick of the 2 star combat armor the queen drops), legendary creatures to spawn.
---
I still want them to make the Enclave Plasma Gun a legendary and give it actual mods instead of lock8ng them behind MODUS (so you can only buy pre-modded guns from him)
---
But there is 100 other posts that have it already.
---
The ammo's that show as 0 weight actually weight 1 per 10,000.
---
I had all TS armor and still die constantly. Don’t think it works as well against the assaultron.
---
Thanks. I’d like to go there to see the radstags there some day.
---
like 40 caps to place a camp makes a difference. Suck it up buttercup.
---
Isn't Encrypted a public event now? Or is it one of the exceptions?
---
Haven't tried it since they updated events, so I don't know if you still drop junk on death.
---
think its og
---
Congrats!
---
Very true, it could have been good. But it fell very flat and there was, is, so much broken. Plus the microtransactions really made me sad. It actually broke my heart when I played this game.
---
It's also fun watching the collection of Collectrons build up in my camp from doing this.. I had my own robot army searching for my pumpkin suit!
---
it is, and you don't lose it, but still sometimes i die right after it ended because it explodes or there are still other robots and I can't risk losing my precious flux
---
I didn't even know heh, but I will take a look at the files tonight and see. Appreciate the heads up.
---
I'd say upgrade, but new xbox next year. About half way through a generation, you gotta buy the upgrades man. These games are now being developed with the intent to port to next gen. That OG hardware struggles now.
---
 You deserve to get griefed. You and others that makes poor choices and have a bad mentality is making games worse and it effect's many people that don't want to get scammed from greedy game devs. It's OK to make decisions that doesn't effect anyone else but yourself, it's a another matter entirely to make poor decisions that fuck's over a lot of other people. You ARE the problem! GFY you POS!
---
It's expensive, with low drop rates for the actual rewards. I don't need any more stupid fedoras.
---
If they wanted to salvage their rep they would do this. But I think they would let this game fail before that happens. I deleted the game last week because of their nonsense. My bet is I will eventually dorgetnit exists and others will also and the game will fade out.
---
Thx
---
I've been following this game since release. I didn't buy it because of the negative reviews... I kept watching videos saying how bad the game was so a few days ago I decided to buy it cheap just to see it for myself... Only played about an hour but it doesn't seem too bad so far. I only bought it for £6 though so I'm probably not going to be as easily disappointed as others.
---
When did the responders get stuff?  I bought a power armor skin and a pump shotgun skin awhile ago.  I've been waiter for the flag and other stuff similar to the Free States.  Did I miss it?
---
Thank you for the clarification, maybe I received a plan but didn’t realize it, I’ll check when I play today 👍🏻
---
Then I shall be buy fallout1st so I can be hunted
---
It unlocks when a certain amount of XP is gained and does bot coincide with the player's level unfortunately.
---
Find a crossbow, hide as long as possible, kill mobs silently with the crossbow along the way
---
Still seems a pathetically small sum, especially over the course of a year, but hey, now you can spend blow it all on beer and pizza tonight. Enjoy!
---
Right, wrong or indifferent, Australia will feel the hit as game companies decide they are not worth the risk.  It doesn’t matter if it’s right.  Game companies won’t offer their products in a market where risk is greater than reward.   This is a slippery slope, and it’s subjective at best.  You don’t have to like what I say.  You don’t even have to agree.  Just remember I said it when it happens... or not.  I really don’t care.  I have a decent grasp of how the real world works.  I try not to insert my head into dark one places.
---
I need to offload some caps if your on Xbox.
---
It's hard to tell rarity and value of them so far, but Practice pumpkins seems low value.
---
I took so much shit from all my buddies. I stuck by the game. Grew my little power armor shop. Managed my storage so i had only the best peices available for sale(focused on T-51 BoS for liiifeee) then that sub shit comes out...well there goes my store...some ass hat that pays 12.99 can out sell my shop through pure inventory alone...such bullshit....
---
They printed redacted pages to protest shitty whistleblower laws and the Libs attempts at removing the last vestiges of a functuining press. What are you talking about thry censored themselves to promote censorship? Are you having a stroke?
---
Ibwas thinking the same thing lol. Subscribe, put on the Ranger outfit and wait for people to try and kill me
---
Others have reported it, but I've never experienced it on PC.
---
It doesnt unfortunately. It is useful for removing ER from underarmor lining. If you use raider lining, you can also get addicted to med-x which completely negates the DR gained from it, leaving you with only the spexial buffs
---
https://youtu.be/yw3fl3wsyJ4
---
Who's laughing now?
---
I hope you like the taste of Bethesda's asshole
---
Gl with that!
---
Ha did they put out a list of possible rewards?
---
Its crap. I run 1st icon always and have never seen this happen to me or anyone else. You can mothman dance on top of a scrapbox and not be bothered.
---
🤔
---
🙊
---
I get a lot of thumbs down when the mischief night ends, but I just hit them with the robot dance.
---
I never knew this. I might have to look into this. How hard is it to make?
---
People trying to act like they're victims for having a new outfit lol.
---
It's based on purchasing parity. Not the exchange rate.

[Closer to your theme.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1875c8&amp;d=lt2lu2l71ib4am2c72c81eo2eh2em1s72s52si2sj2se2sg2pq0a00ao0a80aj2&amp;w=i44c62ce0pe0pm0ss2a72ar2&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=) Blocker is flat damage reduction. So is Fireproof. As you have thru-hiker as a staple, consider Cola nut for healing instead of Stims, (or supplementing.) Inspirational gives you more exp when teamed, and Strange in Numbers makes all those mutations handier. Consider swapping in "Action Boy" when on team, to keep your AP up. Feel free to swap Sneak in for Evasive for maximum ninja action. Bloody Mess and Adrenaline 1 are must-haves, in my opinion.

---
it was great though they already tried shady stuff back then by trying to release DLCs outside of the season pass which they advertised earlier as included
---
To be fair I didn't play as much after patch 14. But after patch 13 I was able to do Queen of the hunt daily on at least one character. I didn't use another one for extensive play sessions, but to burn some legendaries to scrip, max vendors etc.
---
sounds like a F2P game to me but ok
---
It looks like hot ass but I'd put it on mine just as insurance
---
I haven't seen a full list, but there are Whitesprings plans thrown in to the mix. There are 10 Pumpkin plans and 5 Pumpkin Rack plans. You can also get sickle plans and Meat hook plans.
---
They told me to restart the game (well obviously since the game crashed, reboot my Xbox, and then reinstall....
---
It’s like, really Bethesda? So many people are having the problem....
---
I just got one from the Halloween event. What’s so special about it?
---
😂😂😂
---
Hunted no.
---
Harrassed and insulted in game, yes.
---
I’m glad the posts with some sense make it to Hot, New is a cesspool of shills.
---
Have you found any use with this sub considering you do not plan to play anymore?
---
so when we fix a lightbulb a year...how long approximately until we rebuild Appalachia?
---
Maybe some day they will offer real servers that persist even if no one is online.  I admit that I expected it would be this way, and I’m disappointed it is not.  At least I can go to my private instance if I feel the need to avoid people from time to time.
---
That is a really good point actually. Dupers have and still are continuing to really mess with this game, contributing to the instability of servers and screwing up the in-game economy.
---
Same. The way it is now is just mixed signals all around
---
Responders have got some cool stuff, the enclave has had nothing. As far as i know there was no big pack but at least something
---
Which nuka world animatronics? Make sure to check against older updates to see if it doesn't exist as not everything brought in each patch is an update
---
wow that’s a lot, no wonder the event is always packed 😂
---
Problem is you're watching click bait. He exploits wanna be gamers (twitch crowd) with rage over a game he doesn't even play. I wish it was happening, it'd be fun to teabag those guys back onto yong's nipples.

Dude it’s a multiplayer spinoff lol
---
Truck or treat bowls are in front of the cottages with hand scanners. There are big splashes of paint on the sides of some cottages, you can interact with those to graffiti.
---
The world already is buggy and crashes, so let make an event with multiple NPCs, ask the players to cause explosions (which since Day 1 have caused use to blue screen and crash), and load in a very dense environment. 
---
I really don’t know why they would ask us to blow stuff up when that has been one of the biggest lag-causing actions in this game.
---
Y They are ruining the future of gaming by accepting this shit. Before, early access was something you did if it was absolutely emergency, and you had no choice but releasing it early due to money issue and bankrupt. Then it started this trend with everything being released in early access. Then they started with releasing it dor full price as a ready game, in early access state. Trust me, the more we accept, the more they push. You are fucking naive if you think they honestly released fo76 in that state as an accident.
---
Big shout out to CaptainNoob! For posting proof of how bad hackers are in Fallout76 PC
---
Thank you CaptNoob for all the great videos on weapon meta videos that are always educational and so epic to watch!
---
fun part is they arnt even just targeting just the fo1st people, i got targeted for the V94 gold icon and i had some friends targeted for other yellow icons.
---
apparently its just yellow = bad, must die
---
Sounds... like a great idea, but for this you need to buy fallout 1st otherwise you can't listen to the oldies my friendo
---
No?
---
That’s their entire new business model so.. yup you’re right
---
You do realize that misleading customers as to whether or not they were able to get a refund is the same thing as misleading them as a whole, right?
---
Ask yourself, why would they have been entitled to a refund? The answer is simple. Because they were misled and purchased a product that didn't work as intended. Straight forward.
---
I will agree, the title is pretty click bait-esque. But it's in no way wrong. It just leaves out a few key details that one could easily deduce on their own with a little bit of critical thinking on the matter. The extent of the click bait, is so people would have to click it to actually get the full gauge of the article. Making it only click bait on a technicality, because how else would you get someone to read your article if the entire context was in the title? If I could get the entire context from one sentence? I wouldn't waste my time on an entire series of paragraphs. Not sure anyone would unless they were SUPER invested in knowing the raw details.
---
In summary, it's not REALLY click bait. But an argument could be made for it being such on a weak technicality. However, click bait tends to heavily imply that the title is intentionally misleading solely to encourage clicks.
---
Checked across, they exist in 00, might just be a mesh fix, not quite sure why though. There were 4, Nuka Girl, Space Suit one, Pre-War Dress one and a Cowboy one.
---
This will be great in my collection
---
I see
---
Never seen it...I have first but never have been hunted in game....most people either have it too or dont care if you do
---
Yea I know, I want the bonus lol 
---
What I had to do, was luckily the blast zone was just barely outside of the courtyard so I was able to take off my power armor for the rest of the event.
---
Had a blast last night.
---
Met a guy who thumb downed me in NW and he was swarmed with NCR armored players lmao
---
Why should they do this xD They have fallout 1st. They dont need a re release of this game they already make great money with their subscription lol
---
Not click bate people are saying they are being harassed for buying stuff in the atomic shop
---
US wont be giving refunds.  Gamers here in the US understand that once you open a game, its yours.
---
You can trade it in for 1/3 the value at gamestop if you bought a phsical copy.
---
If you did digital,  your SoL, either enjoy the game, or delete it, but your money is gone.
---
Done 6 crashed once bugged out and couldnt respawn once
---
Why should someone be able to enter a zone I claimed, worked, whatever, and on their leisure be able to wait for me to turn around to shoot me in the back and I can do nothing? It's so dumb! And this is coming from a guy who does take shops. The way it works favors the offender so much it's crazy
---
The new way for pvp-ers to get their fix
---
Okay interesting
---
Neither is counting all the grains of sand on a beach, but it's tedious. It's the job of someone making a statement to provide proof not the people they are proclaiming to.
---
I mean, he paid for the letters there. He’s not much better tbh
---
I respect the idea, but I don't really want that for survival mode. I want to end game PvP with the gear we've all grinded for. I like seeing what combinations my opponents come up with. Even if that means they'll be better geared then me.
---
Wow, aggressive much? Maybe try living in the real world. This is a game. A GAME. Quite frankly if this is what you’re spending your time and effort on being angry about well then you’re lucky, or very sad, or both. I’m an adult and if I want to spend MY money that I’ve worked for trying this out for a month then I fucking well will and I won’t be dictated to by anyone, let alone some jumped up douche who thinks it’s ok to throw insults around to total strangers. Eat me.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Lol one guy posts he got his refund and is downvoted into the depths of hell, this guy has 96% out of 1,500 upvotes.
---
It just seems to open a lot of loop holes. For example, what happens if another company takes over the game in the future like Everquest going from Sony to Daybreak?  It just seems when the law hasn’t been updated for the times, it would be better not to do business there. I’m all for consumer rights, but it has to be reasonable to prevent it from being abusable.
---
This game initially was advertised as light PVP starting with Slap Damage. That’s been changed due to player feedback. Since you can’t change things for one player without changing it for everyone (for better or worse), how does that work for perhaps the minority that liked it as it was?  Can the company never change direction?
---
Look at wastelanders. Lots of people wanted human NPCs, but the game was advertised as as having No NPCs, can expansions or DLC allow a company to change plans. Does that become false advertising even though it’s what players want?
---
And when’s a reasonable end point for refunds. If a person has hundreds of hours in, played all the content, but doesn’t like the direction the game is going now? Is it reasonable for someone to get a refund a year later (without requesting it previously)
---
I mean even with everything going on with the subscription. There are quotes they would have a subscription for the private service. Does ignorance of the topic allow refunds?
---
Like I said, I’m for consumer protection, but businesses need protection too. Sure we poo poo on large corporations, but thinking of say indy developers of all sorts.
---
Lol. I guess they just like getting their point across but seems pretty childish to me. Best thing was his name was something like old man so cant really call him childish.
---
So all the people who hate the game and are getting refunds will still continue to post how terrible the game is?  Just curious.
---
Australia will likely get blacklisted when new games release.  No game company will likely be stupid enough to admit they are doing it, but I’m pretty sure it will happen.  Enjoy a subpar gaming experience in the future as new games just won’t get released in your country.  Enjoy your refund.  Hope it’s worth it.
---
Not trying to start a fight or argument just passing along info.
---
Quote from pete hines during an interview in october '18, second to last paragraph
---
"All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76--all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff--is going to be free. That's important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you're getting for your $60," Hines said. "That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free. That feels right."
---
Gotta get them all, plus all those new clothing pieces.
---
Braxson's Medical Supply by Thunder Mtn. has multiple of every skeleton part for your weekly challenge needs.
---
What's a floater?
---
So I appears that the hunting and killing part is rare but just being harassed is more likely what you'll run into
---
People who buy $100 subscriptions or mtxs for that matter for a game in this state with the general lack of content it has (still no real end game), are why the industry is so trash, it’s why EA activision and now bethesda are the way they are.
---
Yeah, I'm figuring things that are just decorative. It'd be cool if they could \_do\_ something-- say, a ghostly re-enactment of some player's horrible death, or a figure hovering near one of Appalachia's many corpses. They could go full Disney Haunted Mansion, and have a bunch of ghostly golfers striding along the golf course., working the pumps and doing barbershop harmonies at the Red Rocket filling stations...
---
Only on Reddit.  Anything else is fake news
---
Wouldn't surprise me.
---
The NCR armor is considered riot armor.
---
I got Vault Boy last night
---
Okay
---
"The definition of insanity is repeating the same actions over and over again and expecting different results."
---
What did you expect this time?
---
The majority of players bought it scrub. Get real.
---
No I do not have to admit it.  If they say no refund when you buy, and you still expect one, then you are just an entitled person.
---
People who purchased between those dates, yes. Meaning, ANYONE who purchased between those dates can apply or re apply for a refund. Based on the premise that during that period, it was wide spread that refunds were not being handed out. So, even those who didn't apply could just claim they were misinformed into not applying in the first place.
---
Now, if they have play history post dating that window? It could make things more difficult? I guess? Depends on how the laws work around that in Australia and I'm not going to even try to pretend to know how their stuff works for that. Lol.
---
All in all? They definitely can "leave". So long as the purchase date is in the window.
---
I doubt it
---
Other than the lit Jack-'o-Lanterns and the coffin backpack  I feel really let down by the game's Halloween offerings.
---
Most of the rewards from Mischief Night are just recycled items. I think it'd be way better if instead of a costume we got something like toilet paper streamer decorations, mischief pyres, smashed pumpkins, the various vandalism sprays and throwable rotten eggs for rewards
---
I'd make all the rotting Jack-o-Lantern carvings a permanent part of Jack's Pumpkin House rewards.
---
I'd also add a plan for those posable skeletons you see to Braxon's medical supplies in the mire.
---
For atomic shop offerings,
---
I would have added a couple graveyard sets with decorative coffins, headstones, grave mounds, urn and casket  storage boxes, wrought iron cemetery fences and gate.
---
Black Cauldron (cooking)
---
A gargoyles pack.
---
A Grim Reaper costume that comes with a Scythe skin for one of the two handed weapons.
---
... I could go on but I've got things to do today.
---
I really want to know how specifically the One X players are doing.  I have the One X, and have not has one crash or server disconnect within the last month at least.  At the worst, I've had a about a seconds worth of frame rate drop if there's like two+ cars exploding, but nothing that breaks the event.
---
...you really believe that?
---
But THAT is a story for another day.
---
I read hot welcome, was both confused and excited.
---
My first thought, as well... I mean, you can grind for atoms, of course, but...
---
Wow. Glad you at least got a response. Everyone said they got their benefits right away after purchasing, this sounds like a BS excuse for something. They charged me too right away. I am 35 hour's into no response from my ticket. Good luck man, hope you get your benefits soon.
---
Lol. I had to go for a close up as I thought no it doesn’t say not.
---
That's completely untrue. If you state anything negative about Bethesda on here you'll get downvoted to hell.
---
Just a couple days before this new event i trade a fixer plan for a ws jumpsuit...damn.it was one of my first rewards offcourse
---
I think I'm going to build a prison, with pressure plates and powered doors.
---
The answer to every objection can't simply be "well stop playing"
---
He could simply be a player that enjoys the game and is annoyed or worried about how much of the game he or she likes may end up behind a paywall.
---
And i can relate to that. It certainly concerns me.
---
Or, could be a player having a laugh out of all the outrage currently out there regarding fallout 1st.
---
Regardless, why should he stop playing the game? 
---
I am still very much enjoying my time on 76 (have recently returned after a couple of months away), and i feel it's certainly possible to enjoy the game and at the same time make a point of you want to.
---
I haven't seen any evidence of this. It hasn't happened to me. I see a lot of 1st players on ps4.
---
They're the minority and don't even know it, it's hilarious. My favorite was a lvl 60is guy attempting to grief another player at the Whitespring before the event and like 6 1st players emerged like "try it bitch". We're fighting back now fuckers :)
---
as soon as you achieved this please give me a sign. when i first heard about fallout 76 being an online game and its camp mechanic i thought it would be like rust. with nuclear strikes.
---
would love to play on a modded server to get the rust experience in f76.
---
😂😂
---
Dude you're getting downvoted because anything negative against Bethesda is downvoted by majority of the sub.
---
I haven't gotten anything particularly amazing in the last couple days, although I've slowly filled out all but a couple of the pumpkin plans.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if different days offered different potential rewards.
---
I don't mind Fallout 1st. For my original $60, I've already played 650 hours, so I definitely got my monies worth. Especially, compared to seeing a crappy movie (like The Last Jedi), Fallout 76 is a bargain.
---
Used to be rare to get not anymore cuz of event
---
Umm, what would be the point? It's just something to scratch the itch till FO5 or ES6 which will most likely be single player.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
I did think maybe it was some sarcastic joke and it doesn’t mean that. Well the Mothman emote proved he did mean that and it’s no joke. Yeah there’s way more 1sters.
---
Oh my fucking god.
---
This is like the worst part of Fallout 76 to me so far. I get far more annoyed, frustrated, furious and angry at this complete bullshit than anything else in Fallout 76, including the Fallout 1st subscription.
---
i tried...have you ever used reddits search function? better off googling it
---
The community forgot to purchase the Customer Support Kits from the Atom Shop for 50 atoms per text character of the support request.
---
Plz remove gauss rifle from nw three epic chests in a row with notning but gauss and polehook hurts
---
People being insulting to FO1st players or even griefing them is uncalled for.  I do hope Bethesda starts handing out some 72 hour bans to let people mull over their behavior, but I’m sure they will not ban anyone.  If someone persists in griefing, then perms nans should be used.
---
I was in the Ash heap by 22 give or take and spent most of the 22-40 exploring Ashe heap and toxic Valley (Yes I ignored toxic valley ended up going there after finished exploring Ash heap.) then slowly inched across the cliffs seperating the west from the east. Make sure you got decent weapons (plenty of ammo before inching across the cliff.) I ended up finding the fun way that super mutants ( huntersville, west tek research come in massive packs unlike in the west.) and deathclaws like coming out of nowhere at you lol.
---
Also avoid whitespring unless theres people that can help you around. People build their camps around there which causes the ghoul population to inflate and max out level wise.  Not pleasant when your trying to do something in the area and get swarmed by level 40-60+ ghouls. Because of the high levels frequently going through it.
---
But if your alone focus on Ash Heap and Valley. People don't seem to often go into the Ash heaps so levels tend to be more reasonable.
---
Sure. News about the game. People post about their favorite movies but don't watch them all the time.
---
Why you being such an a-hole? People are so overly protective over this game, it's almost creepy.
---
So much untapped potential for cosmetics.
---
I also wish we could put a helmet on with the mask as it is the best helmet/mask in the game imo
---
Yeah that changed some time ago, could be about 4 months now. Now the custom ini doesn't need to be manually updated after each patch.
---
There wasn't a limit of files, but there was a limit of characters.
---
I will do that for sure. Hopefully it gets implemented soon. Ive pretty much put my white list together, depends on how many people they allow us to have on a server though.
---
Yea I got the pirate outfit and the Halloween pants on day 1, day 2 I got the Halloween pants again and 2 Halloween shorts, and fireman uniform, day 3 another pirate uniform and 2 pirate hats. There might be something to do with getting rares are more common in the beginning but I'm pretty sure its as simple as it's random chance, I don't think there's some hidden mechanic in place otherwise data miners would more than likely mention it.
---
I didn’t say he should stop playing the game. Like I said he came and waved so obviously a polite player. Walked away when I did the Mothman emote so yeah he’s just trying to get his point out there. And he can’t really hate 1sters as he was just in my camp buying stuff.
---
What’s creepy is people spending time going to sub to whine about a game over and over constantly that they don’t even play. 
---
I’m not being an asshole, I’m pointing something out. I would argue the asshole is the person that goes to someone’s playground not to play but to constantly tell them the playground sucks. Let people do their thing in peace.
---
Wait so you're saying that he's not allowed to get a refund because of the shity game just so other people in Australia can play continued shitty games from Bethesda?
---
Not attacking, just doing a little personal poll.
---
Bit of a different case though with games/movies.
---
If you don’t plan on playing what is the point of reading news?
---
Is there any news that might bring you back to the game?
---
Not sure if that was meant for me or not.
---
Its not about what they said, its about what the law is. Part of the reached deal, was that Bethesda had to change what they said on user agreement, because it did not go in line with the consumer protection law of the country.
---
See he’s not griefing he’s just saying 1sters not welcome. No way he can stop anyone from going to his camp or going out of his way to be annoying.
---
Oh I know... but honestly people are after the holiday rewards.. not the 1 star legendary junk.
---
Cheers, companies need to stop acting like because their product is solely digital, standard consumer protection does not apply.
---
Their being silent *is* the improvement.  
---
You saw how thing went when they told us 'we're adding more P2W to the cash shop *because the players demanded it'.
---
Hasn't happened to any of my friends that bought it.
---
It's a fun challenge to solo. I'm trying to beat it with as much time remaining as possible.
---
What do you think of this build?

I always try to be well rested and well tuned.    It makes some difference.   Then I eat deathclaw steak and a glowing steak which ups my melee damage by 20%.  I run with the Unstoppable Monster using radicool for added strength.  Thank you for this advise.
---
Someone doesn’t understand consumer protection and the legal system.
---
Well said my friend, well said.
---
No it won’t. It will come out for everyone- for free- at the same time.
---
I want the firefighter outfit more than the orange suits...
---
so those poorbois who cant afford 1st are now dreaming that betshesda cancel's whole thing... yeh... keep dreaming if that makes you happy
---
Excectly most pro fallout 1st does not understand that.
---
Wile anti fallout 1st people should just politely give there dissliked opnion on the matter. (Aka freedom of speech)
---
Running away is not a solution, it's the same as saying if you hate global warming, Then move to the moon or mars you punk.
---
That fixes nothing, same as blaming everything (unrelated things) on global warming.
---
You sir are a wise human indeed. ^-^
---
I think steam does this the best. Give you an amount of time you can play and a set amount of days. If you  play more than 2 hours its on you now. If you put in more than 10 hours in a game it should be yours. It doesn't take more than 2 hours to figure out if you are going to like a game or not. Thats like paying an employee less than minimum wage for the time you spent using it. Or saying you are going to return 2 bites of a sandwich at a deli and say it was bad.
---
I mean I am happy for you and all if you spent like 20 mins running around and generally unhappy but if you put in any time at all in this game you sir are a douchnozzel.
---
More players then not have fallout first- it’s a success.
---
This is why I got the private server. Never lags, crashes and my boys and me run through the events like butter. It is sad it takes getting 1st to get all that but that’s how it works in corporate business.
---
Not enough of these posts.  Everyone wants to dwell on the negative instead of showcasing the positive that is coming as well.
---
Its not all dog shit and cat piss.  Sometimes there are bunnies and rainbows too.
---
This is absolutely unbelievable, its disgusting.  It reminds me of that time Rosa Parks was told to go sit in the back of the bus.  Where the hell are the mods?  This sort of discrimination needs to be bannable.
---
Extremelly messed up, please take my upvote.
---
We shouldn’t make fun of people who don’t have enough money to get it. Not everyone has a lot of money to spend on extra things like a game subscription. 
---
Hell anyone on Xbox who can’t afford it for whatever reason dm me to use my private sever.
---
So of you get refunded do you have to return the disc (if you bought a physical copy)?
---
Would this also mean you get a lifetime ban from 76? 
---
Surely, getting the game for free is not the fix here.
---
I really like it.. I just wish the game was more stable.  That event hits the engine in the daddy parts.  :(
---
Lol no they didn't.
---
It's not P2W by any reasonable measure.   Yet.  Stop with that BS. 
---
Note I said yet.
---
Not my girlfriend :(
---
Yeah them not being persistent and the 8 person limit kind of kills my hopes of a RP dedicated server
---
I know it practicality, it’s dumb and counter-productive, but how funny would it be for those people who qualify for a $60 refund go through with it, then turn around and buy it again for 30 or whatever it is now. Like they did to us with the bullshit Black Friday sale
---
Anyone else not getting rid of / trying to refunding the game solely because you want to see where it goes first hand? If by the end of its lifetime it is still Fallout Worst I think I'll be rejecting all future ZeniMax stamped games.
---
Did you ever think that people could both enjoy the game and also be constructive of it? I uninstalled the game on my PS4 two weeks ago. That being said I'm on the sub all the time because I did enjoy the game and I still love Fallout and I'll return when they address the issues, however I'm going to hold them accountable for the crap they pull.  I check everyday and hopes that something has changed but I still enjoy everyone talking about this Halloween thing going on that I'm unfortunately missing out on. But that's okay. I'm glad people are having fun in the event when it's not crashing.
---
This sub has and always will be a place for people to be both supportive and excited about the game but also constructive about the issues that are occurring. I feel his posts was showing that he got a refund and that there's opportunities for other people to get refunds. Was it already posted?  Yeah. But its Fallout related so I think it's appropriate for the sub.  Not everything can be gushing about the game like some noob when we all know it's not THAT great.
---
I like that he's added the mounted ticks to his sign, I'm assuming he's calling Bethesda 'blood-suckers'.
---
Not a 1st player here, don't have any animosity toward them, or really anyone playing this game. However, I did think of something hilarious and while everyone else was doing Mischief Night, I was taking over workshops and building a blueprint mock-up of the Fallout 1st Tent(4 wood foundations, a Tent, cooking pan, stash box and a turret) at every one of the workshops I was taking over. I wound up with five workshops, until the fucking game crashed.
---
Agree, I think there’s a couple of places that could use that
---
Idk, I'm on PS4 and never crashed once. Although I only got to do the event 4 or 5 times.
---
If anything the mods should of maybe sticky it- we don’t need 100 posts about it
---
On PC, heard one guy make a comment over the mic about someone in NCR armor, but then the Halloween event started and nothing else was said.
---
Lol, that is rather funny.
---
Yeah about that try sorting by hot posts over the last week. Here's a few.

Conan Exiles and Rust are online games also. But you can host your own instance of the game. How is that anymore or less boring than doing the same daily events all the time?
---
lol got put on 10 minutes between posts.
---
I'd just show up and troll him with emotes
---
Looks good! If you like it, go for it!
---
Well, the consumer law tries to maximize the wellbeing of the consumer or at least it should, it would not make sense to stop a company from improving a product if they want. It does make sense to stop a company from making it worse. 
---
Altough I think this case was about th initial state of the game, not the updates after.
---
Would that make them "Wanted"?
---
OP said offline
---
I’ve just heard stories and never seen any actual evidence of it
---
I don’t blame the employees from not participating on the sub a lot- it’s very negative lately
---
Agreed
---
Don't tell anyone but we already have it on private.
---
I tried to solo it, but wasn't prepared.
---
I’ll help you do the event on private after the public one then we could do it on my private too so 3 an hour
---
Enjoy paying up fanboy, my money going to better games.
---
Well Bethesda did not think it was a small amount, otherwise they would had paid it one year ago.
---
Thank for the excellent recap kind sir or madam.
---
You have access to the internet and cant Google: Fallout Floater?
---
It isn’t too bad. Took me a few runs to get a good routine going.
---
Wow did you really just downvote me?  No wonder this game is going to shit when a community can't even unite in the face of hate.
---
You must have a brain of an ape
---
Lol. I like the sound of that.
---
I see more mothman dancers than not.
---
I didn't know if it was a new thing or not. If it was a new thing  then there wouldn't be anything but if it's in a old game then there would be.
---
Yeah dude they did, just a bunch of bitches on here crying make it look like no one bought it.
---
I sort of did but only to confirm it wasn’t a joke. I’m sure he probably gets of grief for it.
---
Supposed to be a 10% chance to get one of the 4 new halloween outfits if you are wearing a costume. (0% chance if you are not)  
---
I've done 38 events, received one out the outfits (pirate hat)... Just means my RNG sucks.
---
You could do the event 90 times and get nothing, then get 10 in a row, it's still 10%.
---
I have the sub and like having the private servers, but usually still play on regular ones because the private ones just feel so.....
---
Empty.  
---
This is from someone who almost always plays solo too.  
---
Weird.
---
[FEV injected flatworms](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Floater_(Wastelanders)) No ingame images yet but they said they would be difficult fights. They also previously appeared in Fallout and Fallout 2 supposedly (haven't played them).
---
Consumer protection, worse's the products consumers receive, yes that makes sense. Companies exciting a market because their profit may be marginally smaller, makes even more sense. Man they pounded you American consumers into submission haven't they ?
---
I can see PR peeps are in here downvoting me. Sad
---
It’s impossible to grief anyone on this game.
---
Don't want one. The game has provided hundreds of hours of entertainment already.
---
😂
---
Those things are terrifying
---
I was trying to figure out how I got a vase.  Not impressed with the rewards. They really gave a vase as a reward.
---
Haven't seen it yet on PS4 and a lot of players are at least one month subscribers based on the number of scrapboxes I see in camps.
---
I've done the same... drop a handful of whatever ammo they are shooting me with. I wish people actually did it more often because the level of anger they get when you help them try and grief you if awesome!!
---
I would like to thank them for the many MANY crashes.
---
It's to show his opnion.
---
Like "no lowballers here" wile that is infact a pure personal opinion.
---
Except it and move on from it, but do know if you buy f 1st you do say f people 1st. Atleast that's how it feels to some of the people.
---
I'm sure you don't mean it this way but do know you are working on scruwing everyone over by buying into this pay to win crap. (Even 1 time is enough to do so. (Not that i have a problem with you, along long you're polight and nice i don't mind. But i'm just telling how some feel about it, try to understand it.)
---
I understand how you feel, for every choice has consequences and you can not always make the right one.
---
I'd say don't change your text when you get push back also stay polight to everyone no matter how they act to you.
---
I wish you a good day and j hope i could've helped you atleast a kittle bit. ^-^
---
Thanks for the breakdown
---
I think your title is clickbait.
---
RIP
---
Need to get you a bloodied Western Revolver if you are doing a bloodied build. Best damage output handgun i believe.
---
Did you do a month or a year?
---
I think you're reaching, baiting, and intentionally trying to stir the pot.
---
How many hours of that have you spent restarting because of crashes? I’ve sent literally hundreds of crash reports and there’s been no fix.
---
Fallout Bandicoot ™
---
I've gotten 700 hours in. I'd say I have received my money's worth.
---
Would I be able to get a refund if I already sold the game? I bought it for full price and sold it for $5..
---
Before the event I think the only way to get it was a rare drop from savage divide quests/events. You'd get the bos, whitespring and white powder jumpsuits but the drop chance was something ridiculous like 0.3%. Before the event the whitespring jumpsuit would set you back anywhere between 4-10k. Now though? You're gonna be lucky to get 1k for it.
---
Bethesda PR in here so fast. Amazing and sad.
---
My western revolver has been my favorite pistol . I use a lot less ammo than when I had a semi 10mm
---
I'm not suggesting that it be single player only, but a self-hosted server - which is actually private, could be modded however, suitable for LAN play, and would not require a subscription to maintain an account.
---
Even realms on Xbox limits you to 10 so I'd be ok with 8 but it needs to be persistent.
---
Americans, the land where companies are consider people, the only people the government should protect.
---
You don't need all that, you need a paid subscription, and paywalled features. You, part of the community, told them to do it.
---
They could make it require a Blast Mine.  Since that requires Inert Bombs from the Idle Explosives it would limit so that it doesn't completely negate the lockpick skill, and also give more incentive to do that daily quest.
---
Am I the only who hasn't crashed during the event?
---
maybe 20-30 minutes.
---
Nuke it, thats what I would do. With the 1st icon. Finally we have a reason for war in game.
---
these are all great tips as well, anything that can speed up the end of the final boss is a great help
---
Vanguard BOS combat armor paired with a Vamp gatling laser (or vamp mini when I'm low on fusion cores). I usually run photosynthetic perk as well.
---
cant expect much from dedicated playerbases who would literally defend bethesda if they charged 500$ per month to play, some people are just stubborn to the core. i for one am glad the aussies were able to get this taken care of, if only for some people.
---
Post has been up for 4 minutes, there are 4 replies (2 are you).  WTF are you talking about?
---
So people can't disagree without being on BGS's payroll? smh
---
It wouldn't surprise me if they did, but at the same time, it would be a lot of work to have two different versions of the world up at the same time.
---
My internet is fine speed wise and the Xbox is wired in. I rarely ever had problems with online games like Battlefield, for example. I also have very few people on my friends list, maybe like 2 or 3. It's one hundred percent this game.
---
Yeah if they did away with hiding the unlimited scrap and larger camp size behind a paywall.
---
I do not really care for their version of private servers. So I do not care that they are changing for that. I don't buy atoms so not that either.
---
This is the information I need
---
Grats! im slightly confused why bethesdas own launcher  (PC) doesnt even have achievements, but consoles do...
---
Will start from the next hour bro what’s your gt
---
What risk??? That we might ask for a refund if the game is completely shithouse ? Ooooh no, such a massive risk to our company, we cant risk doing that!!
---
Didn't you know? Everyone who enjoys the game is just a Bethesda shill.
---
PSN is jdmquip
---
BOS
---
Yeah seems about right. I've gotten 2 pirate costumes, the new fireman outfit, 2 jack o lantern suits, 2 grim reaper cut outs and multiple plans for the pumpkins and racks. 
---
I'm just missing the short suit, vaultboy and mobster and empty rack plans and fireman helmet.
---
Did they post numbers somewhere
---
not true, i bought it on my CC and ordered a chargeback. depending on the circumstances (game non stop crashing and in my case multiple blue screens and rebuilding databases after the game forced my ps4 to shut off.)
---
Consider me learned : /
---
Also on PC and never seen it...
---
&gt;ggested this in like patch 2
---
Link?
---
Weren't physical copies just cardboard cds that had a download code on them? No need for a physical return.
---
I’ve done it about 15 times and had 5 blue screens.  It’s not consistent though.  Twice it happened near the beginning of a the event and I was able to rejoin to get the event rewards.  Another time the event had just ended and I pulled up the map to fast travel away and it crashed.  Two other times I wasn’t as lucky when it crashed near the end.   It may be more of a whitesprings problem though.  Almost all the other times I’ve bluescreened in a year of playing are when I’m doing a ghoul run at nuked whitesprings.   For the record I have a PS4 pro.
---
Well at least Jim Sterling had something to wank to today.
---
&gt;  It reminds me of that time Rosa Parks
---
I'm going to have to stop you right there...
---
Your RNG’s choice of a vase, a golf club, a golf ball, a walking cane or a cigarette I believe.
---
BAM! its the Vede
---
Not sure, guess we'll see next month.
---
Think I have one in my vendor machine. Check it out. Commando76
---
No, they're just pulling these "facts" out of their asses
---
I’m not mean enough to do that, lol. He’s not harming me but I can just imagine if I had a sign saying 1sters only, well I just know my camp would be nuked.
---
What I've been having my buddy do since he also crashes quite often, is just stand on top of white springs for the end bit and do nothing. Since he's started doing that he hasn't had as many crashes. Give that a go and see if that helps.
---
You’re equating people being pissy towards fallout 1st players to decades of systematic racism... yeah people are downvoting you.
---
Not all items are equal. When it comes to items that stack like ammo, grenades, scrap, etc. their memory is just one item and their amount is just a property value and there’s no difference in data from having 1 of something versus the max value.
---
What eats up server bandwidth are items like armor and weapons because each of them can and will have different condition states, skins and mods.
---
The stash limit basically just represents the worse case scenario with stored items that the game can handle.
---
Thats temporary idk if id include that for new content and legendary scorched beast about it
---
lol. No pvp, no camp damage, blocking people isnt that enough? I’d like to see this drama in full pvp mode.
---
I'm actually saving up for the Collectron rn, gonna get plenty of junk combined with my junk extractor
---
Pay $13 a month for the game to work like its supposed to sounds great...
---
Have you heard of a thing called law? It's not being an "entitled person" if they are *literally entitled to one by law*.
---
are they making sure these people are not playing the game still. I mean regardless of how the game came out, if you are still playing it or playing it now they should not be able to play in the future and get the refund. I mean the whole point is you unhappy with the product so why you playing it even a year later?
---
You know that one picture of Brendan Fraser?  Yeah, you know the one.  That's exactly how I just pictured Bethesda.
---
Oof, thanks for the idea! 😁
---
Mmm I refund Fallout 3 cause it won't open out-the-box on windows 10
---
It’s just weird in my opinion, and can be subjective on what “worse” is, and the run out for it. If I like an update, and another player doesn’t - then what. I mean think of wastelanders. How many locations might be changed? Will it still make sense for things like Scorched to be around? 
---
More importantly and recently however, does utility items really make the game worse?  Even if they advertised the game a certain way, and feedback truly was asking for utility items on the atom shop(and I can see why, the backpack quest is tedious) is it making the game worse. 
---
I agree it being this case, I was just trying to understand the law more broadly since it seemed really vague.
---
I guess I’m just wondering how much control someone has over their product, especially if things didn’t go as planned for them
---
Noooo don’t join them.
---
Really?! I love it. Please, carry on.
---
Never had so much entertainment for a game I don't even own.
---
How is this confirmed? Without video proof this is hearsay
---
Fallout 1st is going to have mods soon. I know that isn’t a self-hosted server but also don’t really see the distinction being necessary. Servers are getting more in my experience.
---
That is 100% not going to happen. The biggest hurdle is the ratings board there. Australia will be considered for new product releases and will not enter a "gaming drought". I have no idea what experience you have that makes you hold such an absurd belief.
---
There are glitched camps where they can supposedly shoot you from underground but you can’t shoot them.
---
Can you read? That’s literally the first thing I said lol I can’t post video here
---
Submit ticket
---
I'm sure they will sell you different tents soon enough....
---
I'm gonna be honest with you my man, Bethesda doesn't give a flying fuck and it won't be added probably ever. Pick up an new game that respects your time.
---
Yeah it's definitely the xbox's fault and not the game...
---
A refund for what tho? The game? Atom points? What happened? I guess I don't understand. But I am glad you did what you felt was right, ignore the down votes. Not like they really matter anyway lol
---
I have 1 million dollars but I can't post it here.
---
Bethesda: You're feedback suggests that you want a $13 Riot Gear 1st PREMIUM subscription service
---
Ahhh the storyteller. Totally read that in his voice.
---
there's no reasoning with most of the people in this sub.  Oddly enough, the article is about how Zenimax misled customer about the refund (everyone upvotes).  You point out that the OP's title is misleading. (everyone downvotes).  Hating on the game/creators takes priority of reasoning and consideration.
---
No thanks
---
wanna link the proof? that would be a great start instead of "i have proof i swear"
---
 on xbox im willing to bet it was a stealth boy assuming revive doesn't break it. ( i never tested)
---
Oh they'll communicate, just not to non-premium members.
---
Oh shut up.
---
Like it's not just a limit to renamed items in your inventory, but a limit to how times you can rename things even if you don't have them anymore?
---
The reason they were entitled to a refund in the first place is because they were mislead about fo 76. Then they were mislead a SECOND time and told no refund. Otherwise why would a refund be a thing
---
Link via youtube or similar, id love to see a console hacker
---
I like setting it up at Scorched Earth events and seeing other players use it to drop off junk or retrieve weapons/ammo.
---
Dude you don’t play the game. Is it surprising people who actually do enjoy the game. Get it if here.
---
Precisely.
---
Incorrect
---
Lol. Love that even when BGS breaks laws and regulations people still act like they haven’t done anything wrong.
---
No we actually play the game and see the stash boxes
---
It will be, but why not give a week before to those who paid and pressure others to pay a little to play before, they already did it with the beta.
---
Reminded me of the Greek streamer who was locked by Russians in a cell in Sea of Thieves =) The guy went to Google Translate and typed "Please let me out" to get Russian translation and then tried speaking that in Russian (obviously first time).
---

People hate to earn anything in game anymore. Its a shame.
---
Damn that sucks.  Why would there even be a limit to that?
---
Aka pulling facts out of your ass.
---
Not a penny
---
dear Evil Corporate Overlords,
---
Please give us private server software so we can host it on our own computers
---
and mod tools so we can Fix the game you cant seem to be bothered to fix
---
k thanks.
---
\- Us.
---
only on PC iirc.  
---
On consoles it was a physical disc
---
Well, sure, but now they come up with this scrap box which helps, because now you can store scrap in there (because it is lower bandwidth) but the result is more room to store stuff. Which they said could not be done for technical reasons. But they did it, but not for free. So it was a lie then, essentially.
---
You've gotta be entirely stupid if you haven't noticed that the OG systems are crashing fucking constantly on the newer games, especially the multiplayer ones. It may be an in game issue, but I roll Xbox One X with a SSD, and I don't think I've had a game crash since I bought the fuckin thing.
---
There will never be anything like Fallout: Dust, Fallout: Frost, or Fallout: New California. Mods will be limited to those approved by Bethesda and will never be as elaborate as those in the past. Mods in 76 will be content created by volunteers and published by Bethesda, which will need to be paid for with a subscription to enjoy.
---
So tempted to buy this game, use MTX to power level quickly, and hunt fallout 1st subscribers. This sounds so great.
---
 Nice to see the community of this shitty game doing something constructive
---
There was something similar in FO4, maybe they just didn't touch anything but I agree it's nonsensical.
---
Praise well deserved!
---
I’ve got a bloodied pipe revolver*3 on Xbox, only prob is it’s level 15 🥴
---
This sub is the ONLY pro-FO76 sub I'm aware of.  Bethesda knows they can ignore you all and you'll still be here cheerleading for them.  
---
What open communication are you looking for?  The response to their latest moves was overwhelmingly negative and they couldn't care less.  This is the sub they plan on milking with each new chance for players to spend money, not a sub where they care what you think.
---
Ok? You already have fallout 4 for that. And those mods are free.
---
I finally did too. Only one I still need is Mobster.
---
Please hold. I don’t have a YouTube account. Gonna make one real quick.
---
No it's correct. Refunds aren't issued unless there's a problem with the product. You're just ignorant.
---
Nuke it, then go back to private server.
---
Literally give it to us.
---
Hey, sometimes cows see you light up the grill.
---
I love bethesda.  I have bought nearly 18 games of theirs.  I cannot protect what they've done with 76.  I denounce it.  I will give them another chance.
---
This is great!  Thanks for sharing these.  I love how these things are going full circle.  First the WV tourism board does their excellent RL vs. FO [tourism map](https://wvtourism.com/fallout76/fallout76-interactive-map/), and now we're seeing deathclaw masks at RL Fasnacht and "As featured in Fallout 76" tags on Flatwoods Monster signs.
---
Don't be so damn negative
---
OP is a bitchass punk and you know damn well it was on purpose.
---
 Besides stuff on reddit I haven’t seen anything like that on ps4.
---
well if r/fo76 wasnt so shity i would post a pic on here of my build for you. but i do play a bloodied sneak build.

Better trick for next year: buy several cans of whipped cream (such as Redi Whip). Hit your local fast food restaurants for as many napkins as you can. Tear up the napkins into tiny pieces and store in a bag. Spray your friend's car with the cream (especially the windshield). Shake the bag of napkin "confetti" over the cream. Let the sun come up and melt the cream. Napkins are now "glued" to the car.
---
Imagine a world where if a company is being forced to comply with that nations laws after they admitted wrong doing, the entire industry just stops doing business with that entire country. 
---
That sounds like a really really dumb world doesn't it?
---
lol 😂 not my intention
---
Congress says open servers are coming soon.  But private servers are necessary in this stage of the investigation.
---
No one I know with an OG Xbox has crashing issues.
---
You seem angry.
---
Hahah well this guy went from a angry Russian to an angry German in no time.
---
Ah I see. Thanks for clearing that up for me.
---
Do the assaultrons not start attacking when you fork the lawn?  I e had them doing this constantly without touching a robot at that point.
---
Its funny you see them as blood suckers and are paying them to do it.
---
*chuckles 
---
"I'm in danger!"
---
Booh you've already got enough content
---
We did this a LOT during the 70s and 80s... wait..  damn, I'm old.
---
I am on PC and it crashes or disconnects several times almost every time I go on. However there are occasions when I am on for an hour and no diconects from the server or crashes at all so PC Spec appears OK.
---
Getting to the stage where it's almost too troublesome to play.
---
Nope I think that's all the Responder skins there are rn
---
I wish I could have it without having to pay for it
---
Can i move to australia for my refund ?
---
Then deal with it
---
Does this mean you'll stop coming to this subreddit?
---
Why must we always edit to defend ourselves. Who cares. You said what you wanted to. Leave at it that. Nothing looks more pathetic then when we have to defend our original posts cause of people who won’t agree on our views. Internet points. 
---
Glad you got what you wanted.
---
I'm literally not lol. I'm pointing out potential issues, you are using anecdotal evidence to try to prove a point? Like it's known that the Xbox One X fixes some issues when gaming, but sure, this guy hasn't PERSONALLY seen a drop in quality on his OG system lmao. Why are you so adamant to shit on the game haha?
---
lol, had some low levels go at my workbenches so I just closed the garage door and left to do something els. (I’m pretty sure they did not know about fast travel.) It felt good
---
I dont think the regulator tries to measure how much more or less fun changes are, they take a much more simplistic view. They care if the game performs according to what is minimally acceptable, it comes down to crashes, performance and server availability.  If we take for example a real world camera, the regulator wont care if the photos it takes  are good or bad, it will care that it does its job of taking photos, and that all mentioned features on the box are present in the item. This is the standard I think they apply for digital items, and its all we as consumers should ask.
---
I didn’t pay a 100$ subscription
---
We dont pay a monthly fee for that DLC.
---
Why not err on the side of the consumer though?  By percentage they almost always stand to lose the most when businesses behave poorly.
---
I feel there is a fallout joke here but I don't get it
---
I'm not being negative, I'm stating a fact
---
Yeah wish I could get a refund
---
What? Deal with it? Ok
---
Yeah lets all just forget the fact that bethesda didn't just take people money but then had the audacity to lock the most fun features behind an abhorent paywall. Im sure bethesda's throbbing heart is really warmed by this gesture. I mean its not like they are just a game company with the corporate mentality of nickle and diming the gaming community. 
---
Well done bethesda, well done indeed. You deserve it. And this sub and all the fallout players deserve it too.
---
Yeah isn't it nice that such a useful feature is locked behind a paywall despite having already paid for the game a good 60 bucks. Im sure bethesda is learning a very positive and consumer friendly lesson from this. Nice going bud.
---
Protip: there's a massive circlewank of lowlife pseudo gamers who love nothing more than a good bashing, and regardless of the fact that there are countless games out there far worse and far more shameless, its 76 that gets the heat because it's a fallout title, and too many little kiddies are butthurt they didnt get their demands met.
---
Bethesda hears your feedback and realizes you want it behind the Fallout 1st paywall not the atom shop.
---
Exacyly what i do
---
oh shi-
---
No people who contact Bethesda about a refund between those dates can access a full refund of the game’s price (other mircotrandactions do not apply). Now nothing is stopping you from attempting a refund after those dates and my May honour it, but they aren’t obligated. 
---
Also this also only applies in Australia under Australian law and not in say Britain under British law despite having similar laws because the British law only applies to physical good while the Australian law seems to apply to both physical goods and digital goods.
---
I target everyone
---
Lmao
---
Of course they could.  Definitely wouldnt be the first time they've lied to us.  They could soften the blow and save face by adnitting that the business model they had set up for this game was unrealistic from the beginning. 
---
As for the atoms, i spend my time in 1st person view and have a pretty spartan camp.  I think the only thing i ever bought with atoms was a door that wasnt blown in half.
---
This is true, but the game was launched in a barely playable state, and Bethesda keeps going back on every single one of their promises, so I think people are definitely entitled to a refund.
---
No. I find it funny how he made pretend survival camps in workshops.
---
Yeah, basically the point i was trying to make.
---
These make too much sense for Bethesda to incorporate them into the game.
---
Havnt seen anything bad happen on xbox, and I see alooot of people subscribed. Not even the use of emotes in attempt to bully haha
---
I bought it for $60 and honestly have had fun with it. But like every game it has it’s problems. We as fans should pressure BGS to do better not the consumers.
---
I have noticed extended loading times coincidentally since Mischief started. I have a tinfoil theory that they are throttling joining, but that's just speculation though.
---
I just see a big discrepancy between different people's experiences. Even having other players around who have a bad connection can cause it to lag (albeit that is a problem with optimization. Unlike Battlefield or CoD where the other player would just be frozen, in this game the engine desperately tries to reconcile the difference).
---
I just think the underlying issue is a network/connection issue. It feels like it anyway.
---
This! I would pay for this!
---
Maybe, but hopefully they do the right thing.
---
I must be doing something right if you keep reading my posts i stead of just blocking me and being done with it.
---
Simply put - Bethesda has found a way to profit off of the modding community. In order to use mods, you must pay. The money doesn't go to those hardworking and creative volunteers, but Bethesda.

Haha, ye hearing the switch being flicked with no effect is really satisfying. I made a furnace ones, with code door, numbers shown above. I also had a switch to the power of the door on my side. I lol’d when they came back for their loot, they thought.
---
I also had the sign ”employees only” on the door to the controll room.
---
Wasnt the case when they twisted Valve's arm. Before that, Steam had no refund system, after that jt did. And Steam is still thriving down under.
---
Bloodied or junkies, heavy emphasis on vats, aim for the head.
---
Why are you so adamant that people need to spend $500 on new consoles when the game is the problem?
---
I only decorate my CAMP with the creepiest stuff.
---
Shitty Behavior (Bethesda's) + Shitty Behavior (These type of posts including yours here) = Shittier Environment. No one wins and nothing happens.
---
You can earn your Atoms
---
You can also buy Atoms
---
Jenn this post didnt have the power of the first. It's just us. I'm still ugly and your still a horrible human being though.
---
And release a toolkit so 3rd party servers can be a thing.
---
" Berserker build misses the misc and legendary armor effects "     
---
Put on armor and let it break, never unequip it. This may be a bug, but it allows you to benefit from the perks without the DR
---
I have two now.  I figure I'll hold onto these until after the event, then charge some stupid amount of caps for them.
---
As pro consumer this would be, I don’t see this ever happening.
---
It's a good thing I have incredibly amazing foresight and I actually called out that this game would be a piece of trash months before it even was announced and never spent a dime on it.
---
You don't know what the problem is. Kinda how bugs work. It's either a game issue, or a hardware issue, or a game issue CAUSED by hardware. My biggest point here, fucktard, is that upgrading your system will minimize bugs, as all games released/updated into 2019/2020 are being prepared for next gen, so the hardware is gonna start getting finnicky. Or do you not remember the shitshow that was BO3 on Xbox 360 and PS3?
---
10/10 I'd wear it IRL.
---
Lol turns out you may have been right. Another user in the same boat as myself said Bethesda Customer Support responded saying it takes 24-72 hours to process your membership! I think that's BS cuz I have never heard of anyone having to wait and this is the first time anyone has heard this. They obviously are having an issue they cant resolve. But good guess!
---
nope, they dont aggro me until the final boss shows up, and once the boss sees you, it seems to trigger all the other enemies that were up to that point ignoring me
---
While i agree that yong can be a bit clickbaity at times, this time around its true, but then again it really depends. If you ask me the people that actually had the mental deficiency to actually buy the subscription deserve it. 
---
I mean think about the message you are sending out to the developers. That instead of making a quality product with good amount of content, fuck no they should make garbage anemic games that are broken on launch and people get to pay to have the privilige to be the alpha testers and then with all the feedback collected lock the most useful and requested items behind yet another paywall. 
---
If you dont see anything wrong with the above picture then you need help.
---
Like your moms vag
---
It would also save bethesda money since thats fewer servers for them to maintain.
---
As it is right now it’s a definite HELL NO. But if it had the changes I mention I would more than likely get it.
---
Oh it’s just because everyone came back to play.  Never seen the servers so full!
---
Yea but also less subscriptions they sell.
---
Hahaha niiiice!
---
I upgraded my OG XBone to the X when the Falout 76 edition was released.  I haven't had a crash in a little over a month.  While I think stability could always be improved on the game end, some of us should be looking at our own gear as the reason for our crashes.
---
It's not, but that's a a weird difference for the literally the same robot. How is a legendary giving less xp than a regular one? Considering the legendary takes "longer" to kill, technically speaking
---
" It wouldn't surprise me if different days offered different potential rewards. "    
---
Me either. It would surprise me even less if Bethesda didn't mention that...
---
I think the "common" mask drops were: giant, man with nose, soldier, witch, owl, and the other man that had the mouth (old man).
---
It seems to just be crashing, but the annoying thing is that it usually takes a few minutes to load, so you have to wait for like 5 minutes to decide that it's crashed and restart.    
---
It's annoying cause I tend to set it to load, then go take out the trash or get a sandwich only to come back 15 later to it still loading.
---
What are you talking about? You are suggesting having to pay for a subscription to be able to use mods.
---
&gt; privilige
---
Check your privilege.

---
But a year later if they have hundreds of hours in? I think that’s where I get stuck
---
I can see - week to a month after release, you’ve played it and it’s bad. Maybe even a few months that they haven’t fixed it.
---
But if you’ve been playing through the bugs but don’t like the direction with the subscription or utility items.  Well now your refund is not because the game was unplayable
---
Thank you! This guy gets it.
---
With all of the "I see PR shills everywhere" posts in the past week, I think a lot of the subreddit could post a photo like this now.
---
FO4 mods are free... unless something changed in the year since I played.
---
Its fun to see you get bent out of shape tho. Who cares about upvotes anyhow, not like Tschudy or players like him need you to say "I agree and you aren't annoying" while give him the internet equivalent of a gold star.
---
I had fun with it too But they are being silent about this disaster.
---
We are all frustrated man I totally understand. This is the kind of thing that makes me terrified for starfield and ES6. Bethesda has become just as bad as EA(maybe even worse??? I don’t even remember battlefront 2 being the same level of dumpster fire that 76 has been since it launched.)
---
Agree
---
Should be available through in-game atoms
---
Tbh, I wouldn't even mind (as a non-sub) if they added different ones to the atom shop for the rest of us. Then they got it "First" and with their sub, and we get one later that we would have to spend atoms on. I'd rather that than some of these skins...
---
I dunno. The first thing I did was contest and take  my friend's workshop on his private server.
---
The event is nice but it does feel like the bare minimum.  I feel like they came out the gate swinging with Wild Appalachia then it was downhill from there.
---
I already imagined how you would be cutting meet on the cauldron, because they wouldn't bother changing the animation for it, just like the meat week grill.
---
Knowing Bethesda they would offer it for 800 atoms in the shop.
---
i can confirm they dont fade, i play daily and have not lost a single effect since i swapped to junkie about a month and a half ago.  i have also completly stopped taking any type of chem that is not stims or radaway
---
I don't think BGS has actually told us that. Darn good question, though!
---
So why advise someone to spend a ton of money on a slightly better current gen console, when a new gen is just around the corner? When it's definitely an issue with the game?
---
Personally I have targeted them.
---
Thanks! Someone with commons senses finally
---
If it takes that long to log in, I'd just give up and join a different one.  Even if you got in, there's clearly something wrong with that specific server.
---
Very shady, but a mans gotta buy his stims and snack cakes some how. Might be hard to find a buyer.
---
&gt; Only played about an hour but it doesn't seem too bad so far.
---
As a single-player or small group experience, if you can get in to having the story delivered posthumously via terminals and notes, it's actually a good experience. Not great, definitely behind all the other 3D Fallout games, but good. Exploring every corner of West Virginia is really enjoyable.
---
Endlessly grinding junk, the woeful flop that is "raids", any other end-game content, PvP and trading are where the game fails.
---
I wore a Fasnacht man mask (long nose), and it counts so the owl should as well.
---
I guess I assumed it would change each month, but we don't really know.
---
This group isn't as feisty! I'll try and keep up, just for you.
---
You ARE still ugly. No wonder I can't get any scorchbeasts! My bait is scaring them away!
---
Of course I'm a horrible human being. I talk to YOU, don't I? lol
---
No crashes on xbox either
---
Good for you, they currently have 12.99 of my money and I have been blown off for 3 days and haven't received my Fallout 1st benefits. Don't know what I was thinking, Just wanted to try the private servers...
---
I DIDN'T. I LITERALLY SAID I WOULD, BUT IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. Were you just not comprehension, or are you stupid? Honestly, I gotta know how this mistake of a human came to be lol.
---
I'd love to go back to playing the game if they could just fix the damn damage bug already. And all the other broken weapons. My fun in the game is finding unique combinations, and it's pointless when half of them prevent me from being able to attack anything. Even more pointless trying to find rare weapons and make builds around things like the alien blaster or black powder blunderbuss when they are both bugged and useless
---
I would probably come back if there was somekind of ingame LFG/MM.
---
This can't be true, I was doing the mischief night event and my girlfriend and I both got one shot by a level 200
---
Oh, I see. Very funny.
---
Play it with Revenant, Mysterious Savior, and literally broken Life Saving armor. You'll have 0 armor, yet still have survivability. Revenant will give you the missing 50% damage bonus and you should be equal in damage to Bloodied builds
---
Dame thats hot ...... nuclear hot lol
---
Or, preferably, through a questline
---
Google it and find out.
---
Too bad that as NV has shown in contrast to outer trash, it was a one off lucky shot and not skillful execution by obsidian.
---
OLD PETE JUST FLEW INTO THIS TOWN AND HE'S CHOPPIN' UP ALLLLLL THE WOMENS MEAT
---
Fallout 76 Mods.
---
Can’t wait to spent even more money on this game 😃👍
---
I agree, it should be equally as good as bloodied, both make you very vulnerable, both should have the same damage boost!
---
I'm sure this is a dumb question but, how do you place it?
---
Good point... or a recurring quest line - weekly or monthly
---
They were pretty awesome enemies in there. In fallout 1 they were essentially end-game enemies because of how resistant and tanky they were combined with the rads/poison, but in fo2 they became somewhat outclassed by the other end-game enemies. Still pretty tanky, but with a decent critical build and good gear you could wipe them out no problem
---
There's not a single f2p game in any way even slightly similar to 76.
---
Imagine thinking companies will miss all that revenue from a new game in a whole country just because a minimal amount of people might request a refund. I don't know man but if you really wrote this thinking it is true, you should go check you brain mate. Wait my bad, just so that you subbed to fallout first, so Im really sorry to make fun of a guy with brain damage.
---
I've played other MMO's where the PUG scene died off, and it was always the beginning of the end for me personally.  I'd be in a guild/clan in the game, and met lots of awesome people, but it just wasn't a replacement.  Sometimes you want to do a non-committal game session with some strangers for the variety and novelty of it, without worrying about interacting with people you know and have some kind of online relations with.  I know it might sound weird, but I think there might be a decent sized (although mostly silent) demographic of online game players that feel similar to this.  And I think a  LFG/MM system is just the ticket for people like us.
---
That's what I meant. My husband got this game ONLY because they promised private servers. When First came out, he put the game down and he hasn't started it since. I am trying to lure him back.
---
We're in Canada, so we're looking at $15/month for what it is now. That's a hard pass. But with what you're suggesting, I would consider it, at least!
---
The Floater textures are VERY similar to the concept art for 76 available. If you'd like to see what they look like just tell me.
---
I’d be cool with that!
---
inquiry: why is is "bad" to throw grenades at the queen?
---
I got the pumpkin backpack went to build it and it's gone.
---
Perfect lets start a petition
---
But when it comes to applications on a computer (or other device) a lot can depend on your hardware.
---
Using your camera example. If you use poor lighting and really old film (or if it’s a digital camera a bad SD card) it wasn’t the camera developers fault.
---
Not saying that FO76 wasn’t buggy (and still is for some) but I haven’t crashed once during Mischief Night on PS4. Why not me but yes for others? Presumably we are both using the same code so what’s different?
---
What if the user isn’t keeping their drivers up to date? 
---
I know i sound a lot like I’m defending Bethesda, but it’s actually more that I’m studying computer science and trying to see it from the other side
---
I don’t want that at the expensive of having expanded story etc behind a paywall. You are entitled to your opinion but that’s a hard pass from me.
---
Crashed twice last night during the event at the very end, also during a sqb fight on pc. Frustrating as hell as I dont get much time to play, after the kids go to bed I get maybe 2 hours to play and then this crap. I love the fallout universe and enjoy 76 when it works, but these issues really are getting on my nerves. I paid for 1 month of fallout 1st to check out the stash box so I could focus on playing and not managing my inventory. Dont have any friends who play 76 so dont even get on the private server.
---
Depends how much it costs to keep a server online.  I still believe that subscription could have been alright if it were just a monthly lootbox of curated cosmetic items.
---
Boi i think your gonna loose more than youll gain.
---
Lol no clue. Maybe some people enjoy the rush of getting a bloodied fixer drop from a 3 star enemy, only to find out that it’s a one star
---
Maybe the fallout 76 settlers won’t be completely useless and defenseless like the ones from 4
---
How would you be less surprised than "not surprised"
---
i have no personal interest in the private servers, if they did throw a similar tent in the atom shop id definitely end up getting it at some point
---
Sorry mate but as an active D2 player, D2 monetization right now is far worse than 76's, not sure what the fuck bungie is thinking but they're on the wrong track.
---
Bloodied Pipe Revolver with a rifle stock is the best imo.  The stock gets you access to all the rifle perks, and the revolver keeps access to all the pistol perks, even with the rifle stock. That means both rifleman and gunslinger apply at the same time, along with tank killer etc etc ect.
---
This trick works for the pipe bolt-action too, but not the basic pipe/auto pipe.
---
cummon switch, no whammies
---
I'm junkie chameleon handmade/combat rifle build. I dont title myself a good pvp'er. Average I'd say. But I love pvp even if I'm loosing and I'm not butthurt if someone kills me 10 times in a row
---
Considering you can only put scrap into the box how exactly does that ruin your business ?
---
:)) now that we solved this problem ...
---
How can we solve world peace or at least world hunger ?
---
It's sadly not surprising. This sub is going downhill fast thanks to brigading, the hate bandwagon and people loudly proclaiming that they are going to quit the game only to stick around whining instead of doing us a favour by just sodding off. It's really difficult having a rational discussion here when the reasonable, constructive posts get down voted down while the negative and trollish posts from people with no interest in the game gets voted up.
---
Same here and it makes me sad. I enjoyed that daily.
---
Well tbh, in extra content this have been a trend in this game. People complained about exp in raids aswell
---
I think you mean recurring monthly payments.
---
I can smell the shills in here
---
It's very good by f2p standards, i'm beginning to suspect most people here aren't really gaming much.
---
This is one reason I loved The Division 1 so much. Everything had MM.
---
dont work. those badasses who said they will grief anyone with ranger outfit never disble pacifist mode
---
Atomic shop. It might not be available anymore.
---
Wow, Big if true. As the kids say. That sounds like it would be able to one shot anything.
---
Pumpkin Backpack?
---
The only pumpkin bag i know of is the death/loot bag
---
Instructions unclear.
---
Penis stuck in Fallout 1st Subscription.
---
Ironic cause fallout games criticise the american way.
---
Oscar the grouch looks like a giant dank nug. Just sayin
---
if hes on xbox he can just link xboxdvr
---
So basically, you bought a game.
---
Played it for a while, stopped playing it. and got a refund?
---
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, what if everyone did that as soon as they'd competed a game that has limited play time like borderlands or outer worlds? 
---
"I've completed the story 3 or 4 times now" time to go for that refund!! 
---
Absolutely ridiculous.
---
Use the favorite wheel
---
Maybe that explains why it's not three
---
They said no NPCs when we bought the game, does that mean that everyone that wants them is an entitled person?
---
I... Doubt it? 😅
---
What do you mean it’s gone? Do you have the standard backpack unlocked?
---
So how do they grief them? Just act like morons in Voice Chat?
---
Is there video hosting on xbox these days?
---
I know you can stream, but didnt know theres a YT-esque system
---
fun feature?...i don't find the junk box or the survuval tent to be "Fun" ..so what fun features are they locking behind first
---
I have a bloodied explosive faster reload one, with all the perks on it hits for \~900 per shot, without adrenaline running.
---
no, in Australia you must barter for it because they have no currency, that's why it's so much more expensive over there
---
I just want them to add the green grass of home
---
You misunderstand. Storing stuff like scrap and ammo was never a problem. The problem relates to items like armor and weapons.
---
If they gave us a 5,000 lb stash in the game as it stands, filling it with nothing but scrap and ammo would be fine as they’re basically just a couple dozen items as far as the actual coding is concerned.
---
Filling it up with nothing but armor and weapons and server stability will plummet hard.
---
They did the same limitless crafting stash with sub for ESO, but at least when I played most player’s inventories (that I could gather anyway) were being taken up by crafting materials. For just items we had a ton of space.
---
FO76 has an ongoing storage and content problem, while I get this was likely intended to release with wastelanders and there wasn’t a good reason to delay the sub alongside it, releasing it now makes them seem super tone deaf.
---
And they are IMO to a degree.
---
The biggest problem this game has to me is backend management. If it had waited a year to release everyone would have been so much better off.
---
Too true.
---
think of the sources you get the info from first before reacting
---
I already saw the concept art and they are terrifying. And from what the link said I'm guessing that they're failed FEV experiments.
---
I thinknit was less about defending himself, and more about clarifying what was said/ questioning the response to it.
---
its kinda just a cloud that you can view and link people to screenshots/videos that you took, kinda like imgur/imgbb for xbox.
---
  all you gotta do is upload it to xbox live and them give the dvr website like an hour to update
---
Its ok to like and enjoy the game. I do too. But to act blind when BGS is actually being scummy is ignorant and lame.
---
Only the stupid ones were pounded into submission friend, prime example is the guy you responded to. Others aren’t so weak minded
---
&gt; inventory improvements
---
no need to wait, just give them money for the game you already bought
---
Sue them for interest!!
---
Right, I read you,
---
Thanks for the info
---
I think it should not be based on DR but the number of armour pieces you are wearing.
---
No armour = +200% damage
---
Chest armour = -150% from +200%
---
Each pieces of limb armour = -50% from +200%, 
---
PA = 0%, even just the frame.
---
Bethesda Bad
---
Pretty sure this is when I get upvotes?
---
I've definitely met a few medical professionals in my time that prescribe themselves medication via other medical professionals.
---
I see a lot of folks wishing they could get a refund and I kinda wonder how many hours those folks had in the game before uninstalling. I get that it probably changes from person to person, but for me personally I got 100 hours of enjoyment and while I'm not sure I'll pick the game back up, I feel like that's a fine value for what I paid.
---
not sure cause they are too scared to even log in
---
Well, of course its not a small amount for Bethesda. There's a lot of butt-hurt incels in Australia that now get a refund. Still though, individually $70 is pretty much nothing, I'll spend more than that on dinner and drinks tonight.
---
Are you sneaky? I have an explosive .44 as a backup on my main (shotguns). I am also doing a pistol build, looking into the pipe revolvers with the rifle stocks.
---
I did a energy resist Vanguard build with lvl 3 Ghoulish, lvl 3 Fire proof, &amp; a furious ripper. 
---
Triggered all 3 pylons and stood in the water to get rads to heal, and just sawed away while everyone else did their thing.
---
Took less than 5 minutes.
---
Normally is not like this however, and the ensuing chaos usually just ends in a someone stealing your bag
---
Except those are complete games that were not falsely advertised
---
this is gonna sound weird and might not work.  manually set your computers time and date then restart your computer.  it fixed some sizing and overlay issues for me before so I hope it works for you as well.
---
That's where I'm at. I'd even \*consider\* doing the same for the scrap box.
---
Yeah, I'd be a 1st member if it wasn't for that pesky price. Hopefully they hear reason at some point and adjust the price. Its more expensive than basically every subscription service out on the market, whether it be streaming or sonething else
---
Will come to you subscription based for 10.99 a month or a low payment of 99.99 for the year
---
Speaking of DSC, have you seen their Short Treks series? It’s SO MUCH better than the main show.
---
I really like your ideas.
---
To talk about the idea of having it privately hosted from your machine is a fantastic idea.  I was just thinking that technically speaking, it might be something that would require some huge code rewrite on their end because it just wasnt designed that way to begin with -- but it should have been.  
---
it would probably be the number one thing requested but also the number one money eater on their side.  I think your ideas should be taken seriously though.  They are very pragmatic.
---
It does look great, not sure how rare it is. If my friend gets a spare and you're on PS4, I can see about giving one to you
---
I've gotten everything except the empty pumpkin rack. I hope they make more limited time events like this, especially fasnact, I would love to be able to get that jester hat, or have a fair chance at obtaining one.
---
If you pay 60$ for something, you deserve to complain about it even if you stopped using it, especially if what your complaining about is what made you stop using it.
---
Some primary effects are lost when the armor is broken.
---
awww Mannnnnn
---
thanks for the location of the Mole rat head thing!
---
Did they disable your copy of the game?
---
but what if I have to use 5 int anyway.  what perk should I use in int besides nerd rage as a bloodied build?
---
If you care, the reason this works is that the frame of the revolver and bolt-action are marked with the pistol keyword and then it gains the rifle keyword with the stock.  On other guns (like the laser and the basic pipe), both keywords are tied to the grip/stock and so are mutually exclusive.
---
It was, I started asking questions trying to understand the limits of the law as it pertains to online services. 
---
The law can be clear cut if you buy a car, or even a game that just doesn’t work up front like this scenario
---
But how does it apply to an online game like this, 6 months, 9 months, 2 years down the line. Is a company never allowed to change direction for whatever reason on a game they provide
---
Ok, after everyone's advice I think this is the build I'm going to move to. If anyone has any thoughts feel free to share them
---

---
Who cares?  The whole point of giving support account people names is to make people think of them as like your cool friend, but they aren't, they are group accounts run by companies. They aren't gonna get sad and leave if they get low karma
---
With a pirate costume hat that can drop too alongside it or you can get one in the Atom shop to keep.
---
People are paying for the subscription. In droves. Why? Because it has good percieved value. It has nothing to do with a desire to support the game or not, most likely. You just get more atoms than you would normally, plus a couple other perks. There is nothing game breaking about any of it. The convenience items in the shop aren't game winning or pay to win.
---
Really, you are over reacting, and are many other people. It's like when you tell a kid he can't eat the whole bag of halloween candy in one day, and he just doesn't understand WHY. Or why you have to PAY for what you get at a grocery store.
---
They are a company, providing a service. There was never a promise made that a subscription was out of the question. I believe they even specifically said at one point, or something to the effect of "at this time there will not be a subscription. Everything will be funded through the atom shop". Something like that anyway, in an interview pre-launch.
---
Just call down. You don't want to spend more ey on it, then don't. If you were really that mad though, you would delete your characters, uninstall the game, and never touch it again. You won't though, because what you REALLY want is for them to give you everything for free. Even the things that were never promised for free.
---
Hit me up, i got your back...
---
I'll take a 4 v 1 anyday.
---
Exactly!
---
I never thought to do this! Thanks!
---
Save that salt for your chips.
---
Now that it’s sticked we don’t need a million posts about this :)
---
.......yeah......hopefully......
---
Because most people keep a lot of scrap (particularly if you're building, maintaining and upgrading power armour), so allowing you to store that for free means 80%+ extra space in the stash, which means you can hold more items, which means you can hold more items for your vendors.
---
It's absolutely insane. Servers crash constantly and entering the Whitesprings area causes stutter on such a scale that it's impossible to move around and actually do stuff. I just have to guess where I'm going to end up when I press W.
---
one time use just 500atoms for those commies who want everything free
---
You, sir, are ignorant.
---
I hve 1 pumpkin plan left. All I want is that pumpkin suit. The game knows! That’s why it won’t drop for me.
---
Yea bloodied synergized too well with other aspects of the game. Especially for melee. There should be other synergistic perks/mutations to go along with every other weapon class. Even the shitty ones like nocturnal. A mutation like shrouded in shadows that makes you be nocturnal during the day or something. Junkies should have perks that allow you to keep med effects +1 min for each addiction or something. Just spitballing but you get my point!
---
They aren't friends, but you definitely get several things wrong. If they're downvoted to oblivion, again and again, they will probably quit the contact to this subreddit as it isn't worth the trouble. Why should that be preferable?
---
A little update: I just checked and this is in the ATX section, meaning it will be in the Atom Shop.

They advertised the game contingent upon content/playability that would be in the base game, as well as the future updates and the cost of said updates.
---
The promises they made; anything not cosmetic would be free. They would include XYZ either in the base game or in a future update.
---
The standards on which they advertised the game were not met, therefore people got their refunds.
---
That’s how products work.
---
I'm curious how many hours you played the game before getting a refund.
---
I do I I know it's been happening I'm just curious how often
---
This would be cool, and actually it's similar to what I'm asking for.  Have people's icons be more than just a dot on the map.  Have them be mouse-over popups like vending machines, showing if the player is exploring, wanting to raid, in PVP mode, etc.
---
Imagine if you are PVP flagged and you know other PVP players can see you on the map as flagged and are probably on their way to make it happen.
---
Imagine you are not in the mood for heavy gameplay and just want to explore the map or do some low-key quests and don't mind similar-minded company.
---
Or maybe you are trying to form up a group for a raid or to nuke/SBQ and don't have your regular teammates available.
---
This would make so many different people happy, I really feel it would make the game better if they added it.
---
That's why games have minimum system requirements.
---
So if your Pc meets the minimum requirements stated in the game then if it doesn't run still you should be given a refund if requested.
---
We get that you don't want a refund under any circumstances but a lot of folks don't like paying for broken products just like they wouldn't pay for a broken service.
---
Yeahp.
---
I have a few extra...which ones you need?
---
Plans I mean?
---
If a senior officer of the company said there will only be cosmetic items and the store starts selling utility items, that's clear false advertising. I think it's odder that you think companies are entitled to say what they want in order to sell a game and then change it later.
---
Dude i play the game the game too way to make assumptions about me and or that other guy id say its about half just becuz i refuse to pay for an overpriced sub thats triing to stranglehold me doesnt mean that people who dont have it arent playing the game now if u know somewhere i can see actual evidence please point me in that direction im actually curious
---
Level 5, yeah, that'll be rough to start over... Even if you do make a build on nukes and dragons and follow it, it could take 80+ levels to get the perks, not to mention the basic necessary crafting ones
---
unfortunately no, on psn friends list it wont show up at all, but in game we still show up even if we place ourselves into "offline" status
---
Wait what!? How would I go about doing that?
---
I've heard about this but don't really understand the details. Why am I playing other games that have text chat but none of this text-to-voice / voice-to-text.
---
save it from what
---
So will I. But something has to change.
---
Look man, if you don't want to deal with people requesting a refund after a year. Stop treating the game as a service and give us everything right then and there when we buy the game.
---
They didn't sell us a finished game.
---
Consumer: "I can't hear."  
---
Bethesda: "We're not listening."
---
Park card loadout are badly needed. Every time I want to repair a weapon, armour, craft ammo, make chems or bloody anything I have to rebuild my perks. Then I forget to change it and wonder why my weapons are so low damage and my AP takes an age to get my AP back.
---
The fact it was crapping itself across all the platforms is a good indication that it wasn't just one guy refusing to update his drivers.
---
Yeah but the game is not complete.
---
Asking a refund after the game is done is another thing but the full game hasn't been released yet.
---
Who says it need saving? Internet trolls looking to make a buck on Youtube trashing everything that comes out?
---
I disagree, I don't like loads of games in this world. Therefore I don't waste my time on their forums.....
---
Anyone on here rubbishing the game is not only salty about Bethesda, they're also allowing fallout 76 to take more of their time. A game they're so ANGRY about.
---
Or maybe people shouldn't buy things immediately because of hype? Wait for reviews and videos to determine if you'd be interested?
---
Buyer's remorse should not be a valid reason for a refund. There are many, many things I can go out in person and buy, and not be able to receive a refund if I ask. 
---
Unless you can make a case that the game doesn't feature what was described in the product description at the time of purchase, then you're just experiencing buyers remorse and I have no sympathy for those who make hasty decisions with their money and push the responsibility on the company.
---
They have burned all their good will with me.
---
No more chances, they have to earn trust back.
---
Interesting. Citation needed.
---
You can drop anything on a world container then log in with another character and pick it up. Don't just drop items  because the bag will still be there but empty
---
If you don’t see an issue with the horrible stability, 50/50 holiday events crashing, and Fallout 1st features not working on release, then you’re more fanboy than I am.
---
It just works, 16 x the detail
---
I'm guessing changed up periodically. They want to keep grabbing players who only sub a month for the free stuffs. There is also a datamined thread showing other stuff flagged for 1st members which includes additional riot gear variants.
---
&gt;It doesn't take more than 2 hours to figure out if you are going to like a game or not. 
---
I can confirm i have spent more then 2 hours on every single bethesda game on launch just to get it running properly so 2 hours really isnt anything
---
oh no, not downvoting!
---
Wait what???? So if I got a refund then I wouldn’t be able to rebuy and play the game later?
---
Few things - I haven't seen 'the juicehead video' or any of his/hers for that matter. 
---
I also said I was being conservative to account for short, hacked, or otherwise bad matches and other players who are bad all around.
---
Yes of course I kill AI but killing mobs only gets you 5 measly points. So if you only find one or two before you die / end of the match - thats only 5-10 pts. I wouldn't call them a kingmaker by any means.
---
AFKing only works that well if you place higher then 5 in my experience. If you have a 'bad' AFK match - and say place 7th and live for 8 minutes - you'll get a pretty similar number to that above .
---
The game also ignores Damage Done - so perhaps consider I'm not that bad but maybe I'm just not the one capping the kills.
---
How does it let you transfer items between characters?
---
Right becuase disk copies and video game trade-in stores don't exist.
---
Two words. Bullet sponge.
---
Going to add this to the official boards for visibility.
---
Posting this every 2hours won't make it happen....
---
Are you seeing hundreds of posts about this?
---
Coz i sure arent.
---
I agree!  My little idea is just a very casual way to achieve a lfg.  Unfortunately if you join a server with no one interested in what you are doing you likely have to server hop. It's a lot better than nothing though!!
---
As far as the pvp goes a good friend of mine just hops servers looking for mutual battles.  He would love this.  It would also be a good way to avoid pvp as well.  Most people I know just take the workshop so they can fight.
---
Yes
---
Again, it was more of a general question
---
Bethesda should not release FO5 or Skyrim 2 in Australia as a punishment/revenge for this betrayal.
---
Apparently mole head is also a reward from the event. Literally just got it lol
---
Wow..... Great knowledge you're showing.
---
How is taking money from a company like cex, anywhere near the same as getting a direct refund from Bethesda?
---
If you spin the Tech Globe you can see where the bombs land...including Las Vegas and WV....there is on that lands as what appears to be Florida...maybe??
---
They should be sued for their bullshit, Bethesda is a trash company and should be bankrupted from this game.
---
Big fucking spiders.
---
Are you joking? I have my stash. Which holds my stock, scrap, personal items ect. It is always full. I need scrap to maintain armor/buff and craft mods. I a very limited on how much i can grab while scavenging and have had to pass up plenty of lvl 50 power armor peices because i am out of space.
---
Someone with that scrap box can store UNLIMITED crafting materials freeing up space for more product. Or unlimited  supplies for services. Made a good deal of caps maintaing peoples power armor. 
---
Why the hell would i keep investing time into a game that is going to sell such clear pay to win mechanics. Its only going to get worse from here...
---
Lol, you really can't let it go can you...
---
Excuse me what the fuck? 
---
No. Fuck you. The game they released on the Xbox should WORK ON THE FUCKING XBOX.
---
I'm in the US. Stopped playing since day 2 and haven't went back. Refused my refund request and I'm basically fracked.
---
Not sure what it’s called. It’s the flat one. I’m sure I’ll get it eventually. And literally just got pumpkin short suit!
---
If you read the ACCC document, it states that they are only offering refunds for people that contacted them before June 19th 2019.
---
You actually got your money back ? As in , check/cash in hand ?
---
&gt; "Anyone unsatisfied with and having played it for no more than X hours should be able to get a refund. Anyone having played it more than X hours shouldn't be able to get a refund."
---
Again missing the point. It's not about how much you played, it's about the fact Bethesda violated the law.
---
hi, im down to run it and see how it goes, i normally solo it as well, i just dont aggro the robots til the very end!
---
I also have a private server so we can jump into mine after we do yours!
---
psn ID FritoZ
---
&gt; with zenimax forcing Bethesda into a rushed release and a paid subscription.
---
Got a source for that or just talking outta yo ass?
---
That’s not what I said, I don’t mind people getting refunds, I was just questioning the way the law is worded the balance swings too much to the other side, and for a small company (again, speaking broadly if the law not Bethesda itself, how would an online service prevent abuse). And minimum requirements doesn’t necessarily take into account other changes made to a computer.
---
I also have an instigating bolt action pistol that does some really good damage when combined with covert ops, but I have the same problem. To many mobs and it's pretty useless
---
Not solo, but also only with 2 others the other night, but we completed it in 5-6 minutes with enough time to server hop and catch the ending rewards of another one. It's just rush rush rush
---
OMG, that’s so awesome. I swear I’ve had my C.A.M.P on the creek next to that bridge
---
That's a fair assumption I can see how that could have a slight impact but due to the limit on venders while that's still there I can't ever see it been "p2w" there's plenty of people who have 4 maxed vendors and still materials
---
If anything I can see the srap box bringing down the price of materials and helping the economy now stash space  it out of the question, helping people like this guy aquire mats for cheeper
---
GOOD
---
Talk with your wallet. I see most of the sub complaining about his game except \*they are still playing\*. I stopped months ago. Why didn't you?
---
Some of the people on this sub will never admit this game sucks and Bethesda is shafting them. There have been multiple threads about how Fallout First is *TOTALLY* worth it and how it makes the game so much better
---
Fallout 76 fans are like the Trump supporters of gaming at this point.
---
anyone know the new reward?
---
The 3500 do one?
---
I don't think that's the case... Just that you cabby get a refund for the digital copy and keep playing it
---
Keep going this is making my morning to follow.
---
I said it above, but the remaining Fallout 76 fans are like the Trump supporters of gaming at this point
---
Okay that makes sense, my bad for misreading.
---
The world should learn from Australia, but everyone can do better in the future.
---
Story time: Personally I'm not an refund-guy. I always bought Bethesda games on day 1 or preorder'd them. The same Quality/Bugs over the whole RPG palette since Oblivion are a shame, but I was able to live with those annoying "features".
---
I have \~300 hours OK-ish gameplay in FO76, never been happy with the unfinished product. But I'm still shocked how Bethesda betrayed us over and over. Promises, lies and now this Fallout 1st scam for a full price title....  $17.50 per month (my location) for game improvements, promised stuff and community ideas, really? It's enough. Uninstalled the game today.
---
For the future? Does any one think I'm going to buy another Bethesda title at release? No no no, for me it's pirate hat time! If it's good I will buy the GOTY Edition at a steam sale. The damage has been done, not my fault.
---
I will change my mind if they respect us players/customers. I can't understand anyone who still wants to support those criminals. (fraud/scam is illegal where I live)
---
Anyone with half a brain, knows exactly what's happened here.
---
Do an ounce of research and it's obvious zenimax is pulling the strings.
---
Not saying it's right Bethesda have caved in, but it's so obvious that's happening.
---
So no need to be so hostile.
---
I thought you meant the TV, which is clearly coplaying as Mothman
---
Did someone hurt you?
---
Consumers will always take advantage if systems available to them. If you make getting refunds easy online, then you're just incentivizing playing the game and then requesting a refund when you're done. 
---
See PayPal disputes for example. I work with small online retailers and help them fight fraud. The amount of actual cases of fraud vs the amount of people who just try to get a refund when they're bored is staggering, and they use it to purchase products and refund it whenever they feel like they've gotten the use out of it. 
---
I'm all for helping people out, and in some cases a refund should be given, but making it easier for everyone to get refunds has some pretty costly side effects. Fraud is rampant with online consumers, and there needs to be systems to protect against it.
---
Only some people have to. They still have to fund the content. That's just due to the monetization model of this particular game. Flat price for dlc that everyone pays vs some people paying more consistently through mtx or subscription and others paying nothing but everyone gets the expansions.
---
Glad someone else gets to enjoy! :)
---
If you don’t want a friend in you can use “block for session” then they can’t join for a day
---
Thats not the problem. They get unlimited scrap storage. My bussiness is power armor. Its heavy. It takes allot to maintain and craft. My stash is filled to the brim. Someone with that damn sub can have all the scrap they can nab and plenty of room to fill their store with product. While im sitting there with two suits of power armor and some misc mods cause my storage is full. More product available=more sales. Not to mention why the fuck would i play a game that so casually implements pay to win bullshit....
---
It’s incredibly hard to get the exact citation, since the articles have been updated, tweets have now been deleted, etc - but I was able to capture this before everything went to heck:

---
I’m sure there’s a way to find the exact tweets from archive (though the PC gamer article doesn’t have that in it archive) so I did my best.  That said I do remember the conversations about it last year, and I know people were talking about it, even if they didn’t have the exact wording on the servers, most people were assuming a subscription for it.
---
Yeah man, what's the possibility  of some guys doing that?! Of course there's no possibility of that happening in a crappy game with thousands of players, many mad by already buying this shit of a game and even more furstrated by those that pay even more for features that were supposed to be given to everyone ...
---
Seriously, holy shit lol, what's so hard to believe? He's not telling you that  he has a talking unicorn as a pet that gives him advice for scoring with women and it always works. What's wrong with you people? The only thing that your comment lacked is " pics or it didn't happen".
---
It's not about value - it could be the best value product in the world, but Bethesda still violated the consumer protection act.
---
Give up man...its just like anti vax moms...I gave up, very very sadly tho, had to accept that now FO76 is a very niche game, things are probably going to get worse from now on.
---
They really did kill pvp. I used to love running cyrodiil
---
While I sort of get your point I have two major problems with it.  
---
One, execution. It should have been more kindly in order to receive a better and more excepting response.  
---
Two, a “trustworthy” company that has made something that has previously been good or great making a product that then completely throws morals away without warning, that’s a whole other level of “buyers remorse”. For someone who had an incredible experience with fallout 4, and then wanted to buy the next installment of the series, there really wasn’t all that much of a reason not to preorder or get it right when it came out.  
---
Just remember that this is reddit. Being abrasive in your response will generally get a lot of downvotes. Even if your point had some grounds.
---
People pay to repair armour ? 
---
Most people I know who use armour usually look after there own but that's just my experience 
---
And with the likes of raid armour that can't be traded or dropped ect wouldn't have that hurt your business in the long run anyways ? (I agree with it for balance reasons it should be character bound) as more and more people will discard there old sets for the newer ones it's a constant evolution
---
You are right. 
---
I don't understand how peoples can defend subscription that actually is broken. Peoples paid for subscription and lost their stuff and the YouTube's are the baddies in this story. Lmao.
---
I mean, I can't even get FO4 to load on my Toshiba Satellite I bought in 2016.  My 2018 Dell G5 runs FO4 nicely, but I wouldn't think of running FO76 on it.  My current RoG laptop runs FO76 as good, or possibly even better than my XBone X, and I've never had a single crash on that deck.
---
That's been my life since the Beta. Worst-performing game I've ever played, in 20+ years.
---
Can you get refunded for atomic shop purchases aswell?
---
I think that was proven with this weeks ITV. 
---
They are weathering and waiting for the 'nuclear storm' to close and die down because there's so much vitriol amongst the legit criticism. 
---
Seen a ton of salient really good advice / suggestion posts over the last week or so and they get literally 1/100th of the focus that one crap *"give me attention for uninstalling out of rage"* posts gets.
---
So all in that I'm pretty sure they've taken a good look at it all and realized they don't have a big chance of a win without 1. something meaningful and 2. letting those who don't play / won't play tire themselves out.
---
And FWIW - I don't think all of the criticism is totally undue or unfair but a lot of the reaction 1. focuses on the wrong things and 2. goes so overboard / personal with the attacks.
---
Its the responsibility of the manufacturer/developer to sell a working product to a customer, its not on the customer to make every purchase a research project... If there weren't consumer protections to be able to return flawed or poorly designed products then I'd just assume we can make the case for fraud and push this through a criminal case. Even then researching every product you buy isn't always feasible or some people aren't very knowledgeable about it to begin with. Reviews are recommendations... and 3rd parties can and are often are wrong... If you buy a product, and its not what you thought or broken... its either fraud because the product was misrepresented, or you misunderstood and there is no reason you shouldn't be entitled to a refund if you try soon enough.
---
Most, if not all things you buy are protected in some way by law. The reason why you can't exercise your rights in most cases is because buying a lawyer is just not worth it compared to just eating the cost.
---
That’s the sad part though. It has amazing potential but every update it seems to get worse and worse stability wise and the team just doesn’t give af.
---
They are able to free up storage in their stash for more product, have a much larger cache of supplies for crafting/repairing.
---
And fraud isn't rampant in modern business?  I hear what you're saying but once again I think the relative impact matters.  Individuals simply cannot impact society at large like a bad business.  It rarely makes sense to protect a business over the individual.
---
Fireman hat is not event-only. It’s been in the game since the beta. You can often buy it at the toy shop vendor in Whitespring. So it’s not anywhere near as valuable/rare as the pirate hat.
---
And \*CASH\*. The Atom Shop is the only thing that consistently works.
---
That’s a little different since mobs are endless in raids
---
I don\`t understand the \`\`thrill\`\` of sneaking up and killing someone with 1-2 shots who is not prepared to fight back. A little junk worth it? People like Liquid Blade 2000 are deeply troubled if they think this is "fun". They are beneath contempt. Why not warn your quarry first you will be back in 5 minutes. Now that would be a fight, not an execution.
---
That’s how the world works. And Players don’t have to pay to fix it as the purchases are voluntary. So they can’t make you unless they put a proverbial gun to your head which they are not.
---
We arnt fanboys because we dont have the same issues that you experience. 
---
Most server disconnect issues are client side, not host side, or the whole server would drop at once, not random people here and there.
---
Some of the bugs people claim to have have been fixed 6 months ago, others never existed because they were not bugs with the game, but rather issues with current network infrastructures. 
---
PC players have far more issues than console players because PC gamers are not all running on standardized hardware.  One PC gamer may have a top end graphics processer and the latest and greatest CPU, while another may be running minimum specs.   These differences in hardware will cause more issues that a network dedicated to standardized hardware with everyone on the same system (consoles).
---
Basically it boils down to your local infrastructure.  If you are in a rural area and or use a potato as a modem, you will have more disconnects than someone who is right next to a data center.    Before you start blaming disconnects on Bethesda, contact your ISP and find out when they updated their lines last.  Im betting they  have some decaying and  underpowered hardware routing your signal to the main data hub.
---
You may be good at identifying bugs, but understanding how hardware infrastructure works seems to be lost to you.   That is, if you are not outright lying about being a game developer, who cant even state what game he worked on.
---
Lol I play Smite, BF 1, IV,  and V, Blops 3 and 4, Dying Light, Titanfall 1 and 2, Fallout 4,  TES Legendary, The Division, Wolfenstein NO, Destiny 1 and 2..... Had maybe five crashes total between all of those games in the past four years. 
---
FO76 I've had crash 7 times in the same day. I have regular crashes. I had less crashes in the 7DtD Alpha than this. That argument is nonsense. It's THIS GAME, not the console.
---
There's a club down on 42nd street where you can get bear head pretty much any night of the week.
---
I would wait to do it until Halloween event is over
---
I guess I would liken it to a magazine subscription. Yes the future content is unknown to me (to a degree) but if the first issue showed up at my door and the staples were missing, pages were torn, and it had coffee stains I would want a refund regardless.
---
How about false advertisment
---
How about false product promises
---
How about incomplete bug fixing 
---
The way you defend the company at fault AND blame the victim here makes me wish a nuclear winter.
---
If you buy a product and didn't fit your expectations AND the product is excatly like seller description, surely thats buyer remorse
---
But standing at conference and make a big fat lie about how good your product is, and make promise about feature that's free, YET do excatly the opposite is not buyer remorse, it's scam.
---
I hadn't seen this quote before. I knew the cosmetic only thing was something they back tracked on. As far as the bit about the DLC, it reads different than I feel like the spoken word was intended. It specifies DLC, so I really feel like people expanding that to encompass anything and everything else is a bit of a stretch. A few atoms, better storage, and a pup-tent don't qualify as a DLC. Wild Appalachia, Nuclear Winter, Wastelanders; those are DLCs. Reading this quote for the first time, I really feel like it's been taken out of context. I understand that people are upset, and rightfully so, over a lack of base versions of certain items. The fridge should have been attached to a questx with skins available for purchase. Same with the Collectron (hell that quest could have been tied to the 2 junk yards somehow. I would have loved that. Charleston landfill is my favorite workshop.) The crafting storage and portable tent though, I think that's not really pushing the envelope too far to be exclusively attached to a subscription. It had to have value somehow.
---
The sub flies in the face of their promise to keep features free. How do you defend that?
---
It's not buyers remorse, the game was factually broken and violated the ACCC's ruling.
---
If $60 is going to break ya, video games shouldn't be on the list of things to waste money on.
---
Preach
---
I would get bussiness for over-repairing power armor/modding it.
---
They didn't forget. They lied.
---
Sure, the consumers have the responsibility to inform themselves, particularly when they have the power to do so ( many products require a level of knowledge most consumers dont have, games are not such products ), but this in no way affects the responsibilities companies have of putting out fully working products. Companies dont have the right to take advantage of consumers, even dumb ones. "It just works", my ass. I should get a refund just for that. teach them not to lie.
---
Because if consumers have too much legal power it becomes unfeasible to produce certain products and services and actually make money.
---
If that happens to gaming either the whole industry will disappear, or a company will only make games as a loss leader the same way electronics sections and pharmacy’s are for many retail outlets. Said games will be narrowed in design and scope such that they don’t trigger laws and regulations.
---
\^ This :)    👍👍👍
---
Can confirm this doesn’t work.
---
And the sort of person who thinks companies should be allowed to fulsely advertise and shit out barely playable products, without any penalties, disgust me. Not only do they disgust me, but letting the game industry get away with it for so long they're responsible for the sewer that gaming has become.
---
Definitely we can't
---
I've never minded downvotes. If I ruffle stone feathers then that's fine, I'd rather speak my mind than pander to people for internet points lol.
---
&gt;For someone who had an incredible experience with fallout 4, and then wanted to buy the next installment of the series, there really wasn’t all that much of a reason not to preorder or get it right when it came out. 
---
That's the thing, there's nothing that guarantees a company will release the same quality product as its last iteration, and blind company faith is exactly what led us to these messes with Bethesda, Blizzard, etc.
---
I did the same thing as a test month and was one of the people who lost all their scrap in the box. This is why i got the month lol. Im a junk dealer on ps4 so same idea, alot of repeat customers, and the scrapbox helps tons with weight. The tent helps me just drop everything and continue my route. I honestly dont farm events or even take over workshops in my world, my route gives way more then they can produce and i dont have time considering my route is the whole map. Also most the ore cuts into acid sales besides lead. I honestly dont care if people join my world or take over the shops, i just let them know that im busy working and to please leave me be when im in my private world. More of a focus deal, no camps or people equals no distractions and i can actually get the orders i need. I dont need the private worlds to get quanity i get by any means, i was doing it before hand, just less of a headache now being able to move bigger orders. Yesterday i sold 250 bulk lead...and that was just lead without any help from the shops. Needless to say i have to do another run after work 😅. But totally agree if they ironed out the issues and lowered the price im sure itd pan out better for them.
---
And this bitchy/whining post is just as bad and has been said enough times as well. Great you have opinions, thanks for sharing
---
Check the trello board.
---
upvote, because you are right.
---
Though, people will hate you for it.
---
60$ will not break me but i will certainly not throw them out and forget about them.
---
You act as if 60$ is nothing to you, ill send you my bank details so you could transfer me them because clearly you are super rich and cool.
---
Can you find an example where consumers had too much power over businesses.  Can you find 3?  Can you find enough examples to outpace the damage big business had done to individuals?  Fuck no you can't because that simply isn't how the world works.  Might as well fear the boogeyman.
---
Welcome to class struggle bitch ;)
---
You get that the judgement was against Zennimax, right?
---
What ruined it for you?
---
More than lower the price, they could offer a second subscription for half the price without the atoms.
---
You got a gold less than a minute after you posted this. Did you reward yourself?
---
I will....it has gotten really bad where everyone is in passives mode
---
That's nice. Are they going to actually fix anything?
---
I have heard that beep many times on PS4 and never crash afterwards.
---
There have been downvote-bots in all 76-related subreddits since launch.
---
And you can still do that, I don't have any power armour mods and I can only repair it to 100% if I ever need it doing il come to someone like you and I have the stash box 
---
What I'm trying to say is shops like yours that are more of the service types will always be in the decline as there's no cap on what mods people can learn, bound armour, and respecing 
---
Since everyone can collect all the mods and most people will have them all after a few months of playing
---
This post is a breath of fresh air.
---
“Shut up and play the game” bro I didn’t know anyone still played this game, let alone recommended other people to play it
---
Steam’s refund policy is very different.  You don’t get a refund a year later.  The precedent of allowing a virtually unlimited time to get a refund is way too generous.  People can just play a game until they get tired of it, then say I don’t like this anymore give me a refund.  No company in its right mind is going to assume that risk going forward.  You people aren’t nearly as smart as you think you are.
---
And by all means you people can keep giving a thumbs down.  Just because you don’t like something doesn’t mean it’s not true.  I have bought plenty of games I didn’t like after I tried them.  Life has risk.   I don’t post here to be popular.  I’m not a millennial.  I don’t get my self esteem by how many thumbs ups I can get from the unwashed, ignorant masses.
---
Yeah, that's fair. The spider and snake situation isn't ideal...
---
Yeah, totally. I wasn't clear and I apologize. I blame Reddit While Working™.
---
If there are laws that would oblige a refund, folks should totally feel free to avail themselves of that and Bethesda shouldn't sandbag on their refunds. 
---
I'm making the assumption that the people _wishing_ they could get a refund are unable to get a refund because they are not covered by the Australian consumer protections in question.
---
Yeah but everyone is blaming Bethesda!! All I'm seeing is Bethesda this, Bethesda that!!
---
Yet people can't get it through their skulls they aren't stopping shit.
---
Had that before.... lol!
---
Bethesda's non-existent refund policy should be shamed into fucking Oblivion.   Sorry, but if you're defending their policies, you're an idiot because you're actively supporting something that is not beneficial to you, or your fellow consumers/gamers. 
---
They only allowed 76 to be sold on their own digital distribution platform (which is barebones), and were considering digital purchases non-refundable, which is ridiculous since other platforms like Steam at least allow you to refund a game if you play it only a set amount of time.  Bethesda offered no such grace period.
---
You could tell it was all very calculated.  They most likely knew that Fallout 76 would be received negatively, and by having it strategically only sold on one platform, they could write the terms to how refunds are (in this case *not* given out) provided, and they basically screwed a bunch of people over even where it should have been illegal.
---
Don’t forget that there are people actively trying to harass 1st members. Shit’s a little stupid to try to make the game less enjoyable for others just because you’re mad at BGS. Most of the people on my friends list bought in, half of what’s left hangs out regularly on private servers. It’s a game, guys. No need to direct your hate toward other players. Uninstall if you’re that unhappy.
---
Ok lets not compare them to trump supporters or even bring that into the sub
---
You can block friends for the session but it’s time consuming if you have lots.
---
Let em'. Truth is the truth. Whether they like it or not. I'll be here when this game gets wastelanders just like everyone else. People wanna refund their games? More power to ya, doesn't hurt BGS/ZM a bit.
---
When companies employ unethical practices—and designing inconvenient mechanics into a product just so you can sell a more convenient solution is unethical—they should be called out on it. This argument amounts to “Shut up and take what you’re given”. No thanks.
---
Same can be said for your view. Do you think this post is gonna change peoples mind?
---
There is a random event where an eyebot is broadcasting morse code as it passes by. Could it had been that?
---
Did they even have time to read this before the gold was given?
---
Never seen it on PS4
---
As a Fallout 76 player, fan, and believer, I congratulate you. You are absolutely right. I'm sorry that it took so long for that.
---
He got 2 within 10. It’s almost like OP is right or something.
---
I wish we had an ACCC. EA won't give me a refund with Origin Access :) I bought it and 9 minutes late I get banned without even doing a damn thing.
---
not if you dont have any friends they cant!
---
;-)
---
&gt; Unless you can make a case that the game doesn't feature what was described in the product description at the time of purchase
---
Which they did and the court agreed, rendering the rest of your rant kinda pointless.
---
God bless the enclave!
---
I'll give it a look. I hope it'll not be qome kind of invisible sound generator like the one in harper's ferry that play a patriotic music
---
Sanddude is a foodbuild.....outside of sb/tesla is he trash!!!
---
Friends should ask first if they were friends...
---
No, bethesda made a game. People "enjoyed" for months. The remaining player base loved it and seemed fine. Zenimax decides to give use a sub service for private servers and suddenly there are more than just problems with the sub service. According to them, the game has sucked the whole time. Yet they were fine 2 weeks ago.
---
yes. tent is amazing. really love place it after destroying communists in american soil... i mean in workshops... and store some free junk in scrap box
---
If you have a full set of troubleshooter's armor, can you take all 3 pylons and not worry about using that many stims?
---
Aw I'm so upset that a person that seems to know nothing about the game called me that. Anyway!
---
Xbox. It seems to effect some people and not others..
---
Boot lickers must rise up to defend the interests of big corporations. Don't you see?
---
It's not about that 60$ is a small sum in a whole year as you pintlessly described, but hurting Bethesda's ass by refunding this abomination of a game.
---
A post crying about people crying - how original and refreshing and not at all hypocritical.
---
Honestly was so happy. Never got one before. Got 2 of them actually. Crazy! I appreciate whoever done it I know that.
---
Why would that be a bold move
---
Or a credit card
---
I don’t have server disconnects, I have crashes, like everyone on every device. The game is the most unstable mainstream game on the market. 
---
Bugs that were “fixed” six months ago got re-introduced with recent updates. Being stuck in power armor? Duplicate frames? PA pieces magically disappearing on login? They were fixed months ago, but many people are still getting them because newer updates invalidated previous fixes. Fallout 1st’s features not working for a week for a majority of players? It’s called lazy testing. 
---
I play on console and everyone I know plays on console. We all have the same issues, constantly. Again, it’s an engine issue. 
---
Again, not disconnects. CRASHES and bugs. I haven’t been disconnected from anything in months. Same with everyone I know, all over the US and one from Canada and one from Sweden. Again, this is an engine issue with attempting to run on Xbox One X’s not an ISP issue. Losing a full set of PA, PA unequipping in combat, the raid wiping characters, events causing crashes because of the amount of players, lag during the Queen, freezes, legendaries not dropping anything, enemies dying for no reason, Fallout 1st features not working, NONE of that is ISP related lol. 
---
I can’t state what game I worked on since I released minor details on our processes, which is considered IP and, at worst, I would be black listed for disclosing.
---
I guess it is up to the ACCC and what they consider "a fault which amounts to a major failure." I can certainly see how the waters could be muddy there. I suppose I can see how not being able to finish one of the main quest lines because you can't click on a vending machine could constitute a major failure, but I'm not sure about things like getting stuck in power armor for months or atom shop items not functioning.
---
u/ladydevann i know you must be busy and all with these complaints, but it'd be great if you could tell the people who designed the fasnacht masks that they really nailed it, and it'd be great if you could show them my photo! Thanks and good luck with the trouble, i hope you and the team continue to make the game better!
---
If you like it then play it. If you think that its value dropped low enough for you to go somewhere else for your entertainment then do that.
---
I'm of course glad that people are getting refund if they think they were cheated and didn't get their money's worth, but I certainly do not need it. I think I've got about 100h or even more and most of it I enjoyed. So even if I play different game for a few months now and they introduced some pay2win options during my break I do not want refund. Maybe they will trash this game so much I will never come back, but it was good when I played it and that they can't change.
---
Good choice.  Our users would very much make bad faith edits to change the narrative. 
---
This is the environment you have given us by not moderating all of the hostile anti-FO1st hatespam this sub has been ripe with since launch.
---
Rule #4, remain civil. 
---
The haters have been nothing but the opposite, and you let it happen. 
---
If you have rules you have to enforce them for everyone, not just the people who share your view.  IF they share your views and are being assholes and bashing, trashing, harassing and treating one type of player with disrespect, then you should take action.   But you dont.   
---
This sub is no better than Congress right now.  One side is allowed to be lawless (the vocal minority) while the main playerbase (the silent majority) has to take all this heat, hatred and greifing without consequence.
---
Right..... that's why the ACCC of Australia has issued zenimax to give out refund for misleading customers?????
---
No, I'm not whining about anything. Just giving a reminder to those bitching about non-sense.
---
Link to video... how did you later record it live from Xbox?
---
He said
---
&gt; some ass hat that pays 12.99 can out sell my shop through pure inventory alone...such bullshit....
---
I'm not saying he's right, but that is the argument he's making.
---
Dude, I don't even know. Pretty sure they seen, "stop being crybabies" and knew it was good lol.
---
Can you use anyone’s scrap box if you have 1st?
---
We have been investigating reported incivility and personal attacks. We have issued more bans in the past 2 weeks than any other point in the subreddit's history.
---
Lmao I love how utterly nonsensical the loot is in this game. 
---
Kill a yaoguai? Here, have this assault rifle he was holding In his ass! 😂😂😂
---
I'm sure it will some. At some point the people that are hopping on the hate train will realize that they've been hating on nothing and give up.
---
Yah, wastelanders needs to make this feel like a real fallout game and future games need to come out actually finished and in a good state. Otherwise I wont support bethesda anymore.
---
only thing that premium subscription need is allow 1st players do slap damage to other players
---
So to a point I agree with you, that doesn't make them saints and your also pretty quick on forgiving them who loses people items ( one of those bugs from the vaults). So like i said your kinda right but that doesn't give them a free pass. My main is worth about $400 atm and I'd be understandably mad if i did lose all my items. Expect people 2 bitch about this kinda game
---
Damn dude, you’re far gone. I feel bad for you and your family.
---
maybe not the definition of pay2win, but definitely leaning towards it... you can gain any item a lot quicker now
---
"There is no war in Ba Sing Se"
---
But why can’t you just find one as loot in game? Do they seriously not have ANY cosmetics outside of the additional paywall?
---
Your whole post is you basically whining about what others are posting.
---
But thank God you stood up for Bethesda and took the time to "remind" people bitching about nonsense to not bitch about nonsense with a post where you pretty much bitch about nonsense.
---
How you don't see the irony is beyond me.
---
Your argument is weak.  It has no facts.  It doesn’t provide a context.  Just generalized BS from a manure factory.
---
Melee bonus damage foods(don't think there's any drink?) all stack up. 
---
You can use the normal 10% glowing steal, the dog steak that runs with super mutants, sheepsquat steak and yuan guai steak. That alone gives 40%. Then you can run improved versions of at least 2 the two latter ones for 2x15%.
---
It would need to be tested in court... But if suggest that saying before a game comes out that there will only ever be cosmetic items, and then introducing utility items later, is likely to land you in trouble.
---
The browbeating on both sides of this issue is tiresome in the extreme. Some people have rational reasons for thinking this is/isn't a big deal. Telling people who are on the other side of the issue to "shut the fuck up," while they also rant away is juvenile.
---
Yes. Thank you. 
---
People just need to move on- specially the ones who don’t even play the game anymore.
---
Is it just me or do you need to get a life...?
---
I think they are the super rare that have been duped.
---
That's a lot of damage!
---
Jesus your butthurt. It’s called logical reasoning and doesn’t need examples to work. Why do you think restaurants reserve the right to refuse service to anybody for any reason? Why do refund terms have time limits before you no longer can?
---
In regards to gaming if we could get a refund no matter how long we’ve played it or how much time has passed since we purchased it then a company would go under because the majority would play the story once, or the mp for a week or two, then demand their money back.
---
If this has to be explained to you you’re the one who doesn’t have a clue on how the world works.
---
Make it three.
---
Sorry, but there is no way this abomination of a game doesnt carry massive fault for the crashing. I love it, play it every day with a guy on a x1 he crashes just like I do. In fact I made it thru the last event and he crashed out.
---
If I bought a burger and took a bite out of it and it was raw then I should get a refund. A game isn't a burger though. Bethesda also made claims they never fulfilled.
---
&gt; I'll spend more than that on dinner and drinks tonight.
---
What does you being inefficient with money have to do with anything?
---
Just look at how the mods deleted the fallout first . Com post. This sub isn’t for fans, it’s for targets.
---
3 awards boi
---
Crap, someone beat me to it? I'll go look in a second.
---
For an online game Bethesda most likely has a team of 50-200 people testing it...
---
If op can actually justify spending the money on fallout first,  odds are they can tell themselves that buying 2 reddit golds to give to themselves is a good investment
---
*waits 2 months for Beth to steal the idea*
---
Amen.brother
---
"Can you guys stop being crybabies?" - person crying
---
Classic. 
---
&gt; Stop trying to find stupid shit to get mad over
---
pot meet kettle
---
Monster mask isn't even supposed to be normally wearable except in monster mash.
---
 OMG you hit the nail on the head. I said the same thing before this event even came out. The white spring was the stupidest place that they could have had it. there are so many better locations that would have actually fit the Halloween theme better and had better framerate performance. 
---
 Places like fort defiance, the prison, Point pleasant or hell just about anywhere else would have been a better choice. 
---
 And I don't get why we have to fight robots for Halloween? How is that even halloween-themed?
---
I mean don't get me wrong the idea of the event was amazing but just like everything Bethesda does the execution needs loads of work and they were definitely unprepared to release this event.
---
 I will say that while I got sick of grinding meat week it ran almost flawlessly. Whoever was on that team should have been put in charge of this event. And whoever came up with the idea to run it out of white spring should be fired.
---
 They just finished taking a fresh hot shit all over their players with fall out first and then decided to add a second round not even a week later.
---
Is @bethesda trying to run this game into the ground on purpose!?!?!
---
The big problem is my bussiness its very limited by my scrap. I bust my ass to gather the correct materials to have them on hand for repairs. It infuriates  me that someone can buy unlimited space grabbing everything they can see. Make me feel like my hard work means nothing.
---
People paid for a service that had advertised promises or commitments. I think its reasonable to assume either fraud or maybe just give them a refund because its not what you sold.
---
&gt;Unless you can make a case that the game doesn't feature what was described in the product description at the time of purchase,
---
Which is exactly what this whole situation is about.
---
What exactly is the point of your rant?
---
Probably have been, damn dupers
---
No fucking shit, brainlet. 
---
Defend them some more.
---
Lol This is pretty funny
---
One hour later.......
---
Logic without practical application is just philosophy.  Hopefully I don't have to explain how blindly applying philosophy can result in catastrophe.  
---
Did you bother reading about the thing that has you so triggered?  Only Australians who requested a refund on or before June 2019 are eligible.  Nice straw man that didn't even need attacking.
---
Np, btw there's also a public Halloween event on now until Nov 5th (with free travel).
---
You really aren't fooling anybody
---
Congratulations! Props to Australia for holding Bethesda accountable at least.
---
I understand the actual problems people are having but a lot of the stuff people are finally complaining about has been a problem for a long time. Don't wait until now to complain. Like they waited for a sub service to cause an uproar and then complain about things that's been happening for months? How does that make sense.
---
Old Man Winter masks were being given out like candy a few months ago.  I got one myself.
---
That's anecdotal at best man
---
Well maybe on the old winter mask because if you have one you know its duped but the monster mask was an old glitch and can not. E obtained anymore
---
Sure, agreed that individuals can't impact as much as a company like Bethesda. But what about smaller companies? 
---
Treating games as a de facto good instead of a service, technically means that if a game was to change much from release post-launch, then people would be entitled to a refund if they desired because it wasn't the good they originally purchased, even if it was a better product in the end.
---
So you got your refund on a $60 game yet you are probably still playing it? Good job cheating the system.
---
Well said, paying for private servers isn't what bothers me about FO1st, it's the tent and scrap box that you can't get without a subscription that annoy me
---
Bethesda.
---
No. Paid game mechanics... no. We are trying to fight AGAINST this... Why would you suggest it as a paid mechanic?
---
I’m on XB1X and I’ve run the event 8-10 times and zero crashes or disconnects. Worst I’ve had is some scumbag griefer shooting me in the back as I went to get my loot from the final sentry bot, so I missed my legendary.
---
The downvotes are from all the people that work at Bethesda
---
What does that have to do with a badly broken game?
---
Hines said. "That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I'm getting that stuff for free.
---
He literally specifies new features or whatever will be free. However you feel about it isn't my point. My point is that he said them. I see it all over the place where people say this was never said, like in your comment, and im just sharing that it was said. Happy gaming
---
I seen a guy that made 2 posts within a week talking about quitting, finally quitting and then trying to get a refund. All of which he talked horrible shit. That in total came out to make no sense at all.
---
I bailed on this game after I tried the beta.
---
This game was like a long term paid alpha/beta. It shouldn’t have been released as a finished product...
---
Can't fathom being this delusion and blind to reality. Are you being purposefully dense or do you genuinely not see why people are upset?
---
Imagine saying that like you think the ability of companies to test consumers like shit is a good thing.
---
I’ve loved the game since launch, warts and all. My issue is the unethical practices. A sub service is fine. An expensive sub service is fine—buy it or don’t, I don’t care. A sub service that locks community requested QoL improvements behind a paywall is not. 
---
I’ve given Bethesda the benefit of the doubt on almost everything, including monetization—and have vocally defended them—but this is a bridge too far and criticism is necessary. The subreddit that Bethesda tells players to provide their feedback on is the appropriate place to do so as well.
---
Unspecified hatred is still considered hate speech, it is brought on by hatred of one form or another. 
---
Hate speech is defined as:  abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group 
---
Undefined hatred directed at Fo1st members is still hate speech.  Yet you do nothing.
---
You should read your own rules and understand them.  If you do not understand them, you should step down.
---
im so glad the mod team was articulate with the TLDR of the ruling, hopefully that will help with the shitshow of threads that were "everyone gets a refund" from when everyone was spamming the link
---
Does the game run on your computer? Is it the game that was shown in the trailers? Congratulations, you're running their 'working product'. Whether that product is up to your personal 'snuff' is different.
---
The game works, regardless of if it's shit or not. I can launch Fallout 76, play the game for as long as I want.
---
&gt;there is no reason you should eat the cost if you ask for a refund immediately
---
Okay, sure, immediately is fine, but for those who didn't, and waited months before trying to refund, I have no sympathy for them. They bought the product, used the product, and then got bored of it and want a refund. People want to refund now just to 'stick it' to the company.
---
76 wasn't their first online game fyi
---
Both of you went straight to shit talking. Any opinions you have on this post have automatically went invalid.
---
I’ve won the monster mash and the mask stayed on me until I logged off. Even if I put on a different mask it was still worn underneath
---
Id like to believe that there is a larger story behind this event, but honestly I doubt it.
---
Maybe maybe not remember when ea had online passes wed still have those if people gave up
---
Technically - sure.  But even in a worst case scenario it'd pale in comparison to the impact of services released in bad faith.  There is also pretty much no examples of overzealous consumers sinking a small company unjustly.  I struggle to even think of one.
---
That said I think we all agree nobody wants to sink a small company acting in good faith.  For my money I believe the consumer is more likely to do right than when the relationship is inversed therefore you rule/legislate to the ones who have historically lost and stand to lose the most.  In this case (and most cases) that is the consumer.
---
Sub says they’re against it... meanwhile we’ll see one in every camp just like the fridge, collectron and scrap boxes...lol
---
You clearly haven't played the outer worlds or you wouldn't call it trash. It is probably the best rpg in years with tons of choices you can make and tons of builds to play and the best companions in any game since mass effect (although that's kinda unfair as it had 3 games of building characters)
---
Also, would like to point out he said F4: New vegas. A mod that's in development that's remaking new vegas in fallout 4 so obsidian has literally nothing to do with that conversation
---
Only if Australia makes them do it.  Fear the kangaroo punch.
---
Fasnacht-Masks have their own Event. It would be stupid to put them into another.
---
Someone doesn't know what anecdotal means, ig lol. It means that your personal experiences don't make the game broken.
---
I actually like fallout 76 when it works. 
---
But I don't like the fact it's been over a year with some of the same bugs. I don't like that one of the key issues people had with the game was storage space and the game makers said "It will affect server stability" then just to offer more storage space behind a pay wall. I don't like that one of the main PR guys said the atom store would be cosmetics only, but now it's not. And so on.... I don't like when AAA game makers aren't held accountable. 
---
I'm glad to see the legal action making headway, even though I don't want the game to die or close down. I want them to learn from this. To do better.
---
It's probably intended that way since it respawns every hour and is usually being attacked by at least 8 to 10 people at once many of which are at least level 150+ so the few low levels that jump in don't get leveled up to quickly.
---
It's the low IQ sheep who follow trash like yong yea and jim sterling, you are completely right, nobody is forcing you to buy it.
---
Bro smfh, your talking about how BSG is shit and your defending it at the same time. They dont do one thing after another cause there lazy as fuck and hungry for money. And you making this post is no different then any other post on here. Its just another post some people wanna read and some dont. Some wanna boot lick, some dont. Being the this game is broken, BSG is lazy as fuck, hungry for money, and have like 10 people making this game what it is, and you are trying to defend that? You reddit mf’s i swear think a long paragraph with a bunch of worthless points really only based on feelings, turning as much shit you can into an acronym to look good i swear all you are going be talking with one letter words in 10 years, and beth will be bankrupt, and you’ll be at some rally tahm bout, “bring back beth, bring back beth!” Smfh
---
I've got over 200 hours in and there are a lot of issues that didn't surface in even the first month. I don't think you can definitively say that everything wrong with a game is going to be clear in the first 2 or 10 hours that you play it.  Especially when there's tons of content you can't even unlock/access in that time period.
---
Deadass
---
Because now they've shown their hand.  The idea that things would get fixed has gone out the window.  Bethesda looked to the community and said "so you want QOL updates and the removal of artificial limitations?  Sure.  10 bucks a month and you can have them"
---
K
---
I understand that but you have to see my point. People are endlessly complaining about a lot of shit that makes no sense. Unethical practices performed by a company (Zenimax, not BGS) aren't something that's going to change. They already have a hanging onto fallout for the amazing stuff diehard fans are willing to pay and go through. The people that are addressing bugs that have existed since the start just to add shit-talking to their post specifically about these unethical practices is stupid and useless. That's what makes most of their opinions useless. They try and over-exaggerate their point with unnecessary facts.
---
I was just wondering cause since the last update my damage output went down and that was the only thing I thought of that maybe they nerfed it, but I'm about to get home so I'll do what the other guy suggested and unequip it and equip it again and see if it changes.
---
Easy. In the real world we have promises that are contracts and promises that are made in good faith and can’t be kept and promises that are made in bad faith and were never intended to be kept. 
---
The “promise” here is a bit nebulous and certainly isn’t a contract. It’s a naive statement of intent read as a promise. 
---
You can argue I suppose that the promise was made in bad faith but those arguments seem to go tinfoil hat really quickly, are made in bad faith by folks who hated BGS long before Fallout 76, or who believe that some sort of redditor uprising can turn back the tide of “what’s wrong with AAA gaming today” aided and abetted by some YT personalities who make money off of controversy. 
---
The game needs to have income to pay to fix bugs faster and add content. New DLC is still free even if every single feature isn’t. Hoping that a PA skin will be popular is harder to figure into a budget than a stream of subs. Simple as that. If you don’t want to pay no one is making you but it’s silly to expect those who will to get nothing at all for it.
---
but your personal experiences mean its my xbox. drop the insults, they dont help your anecdotal attacks
---
I did?
---
&gt;A sub service that locks community requested QoL improvements behind a paywall is not.
---
\^This, absolutely this! I have played since beta, I enjoy the game for the most, despite the bugs and stupid stuff Beth has been doing but this really grinds my beans.
---
I don't remember unlimited being on the store page. Was there some sort of lifetime membership or pass?
---
I wouldn't have any issue if the subscription was only for private worlds, or the same package was on a different mode for private worlds. However granting advantages for money is wrong and shady!  
---
Also spare me the argument for "Wastelanders".  
---
They already went back on their word for the game. And you can't be sure it will be good, because once again you don't know anything other than what they already said.
---
All of them but can you name one that has released a such a totally broken game. 
---
Honestly the more I think about it their has been many lately.
---
Bethesda now has the audacity to charge for private servers while using assests from a prior game that was better received which wasn't even produced by Bethesda.
---
Plus they still continue to charge for cosmetic parts of the game that don't even work properly?
---
Maybe I should I have further elaborated but my response was rather simple also so was your counter argument given the thread of this conversation.
---
Would love to see this fixed. I have a habit of randomly joining any friend that is in fallout 76 at that time as the quickest way to switch servers if the one I am in has problems. I have accidentally joined private worlds multiple times using this method. I'll just keep running my missions or whatever and it takes me way too long to figure it out when I realize the map is totally empty of camps. Sorry to all the random traders whose worlds I have trespassed into this week.
---
@LaxinPhilly I concur. It’s not like they have anything they could say to the 20 different mob groups shaking their fists in rage. This is a double-edged sword, ultimately. I was outraged for the first week or so but now I’m thinking yes, they lied and yes they’re in the wrong, but good Lord I don’t know what people expect out of what they paid for the base game. Why do players think they dictate what is and what isn’t part of a base game? And before anyone bulldozes in here with their rage points, I don’t care what they are. And before Bethesda tries to make amends for something they don’t care about, I don’t want to hear anything that takes away from the obvious: they do it all for the money.
---
It is in fact their first online game, in the Fallout series.
---
Not life-saving at least
---
Nice!
---
Says the person that calls people with dissenting opinions "cry babies". Are you completely blind to irony?
---
Fair.
---
I also really liked the game (all through Wild Appalachia, until Nuclear Winter) , although their adventures in utility items have put the nail in that coffin.
---
As someone that was just about to purchase the game finally, the subscription service has completely turned me off from ever trying the game. I can't imagine I am the only one.
---
No i have a freind who says the same thing that most are saying doesnt watch either of those some people just dont like having sub fees shoehorned into games they bought that dindnt originally have them

This isn't a cry for help. It's a reality check to the people that can't get it through their skulls that their opinion really means nothing.
---
An Australian court agreed.
---
Which we can get into the case of goods vs services. Should companies be allowed to release video games as services? Australia doesn't think so. You know what that technically also means? Any post-launch updates to any game launched in Australia, could technically be grounds for a refund, because you are altering the original goods purchased. Even if you make said imaginary game way better than it was at launch over the year, it's still not the same product you purchased. 
---
If video game companies were to all adhere specifically and only to the Australian consumer protection laws, we would see a LOT less people updating their game after launch. You would get full games at release, that would never be touched again except to add paid DLC. Free updates that touch any content the game already has added, are gone, because they might alter the original product. 
---
Personally, I'd like to see devs have the freedom to launch their game and continue improving it post-launch without worrying that people are going to refund the product even though the update was a year after launch.

I've never found this to be remotely good.  Sure you can get solid dps but you need to sacrifice too much to achieve more dps than a handmade or fixer and having more damage than either of those isn't really going to make the character much better.  
---
There's diminishing returns to more and more damage.  Once you can headshot for over 700 or so damage you can one shot most mooks and contribute just fine vs endgame foes like SBQ, ISS, Paradise Alpha etc.  
---
So throwing away up to 18 perks to make a god tier pipe rifle when you can easily get away with 6-9 with a handmade or fixer and have tons of additional perks available for defense, crits, stealth, general utility etc seems like an easy choice for me, anyway.
---
In the fallout series, yes. That's not how you worded it in your post though.
---
You for sure aren't the only one. But that's my point. Why has the sub service turned you off for the game. It makes 0 sense. I'd understand if they put game-breaking features into a paid service but they seriously haven't.
---
I ran into a camp with a bunch of players and everyone was wearing it, apparently a duping party of some sort.
---
I understand that, but considering the post was in a Fallout reddit, on a Fallout post. I assumed people would get what I was saying.
---
The first time I thought that I didn’t post it so I just made another one.
---
Unlike your opinion,  of course.
---
That just depends on the post actually
---
Not as an Atomic Shop item, no.
---
But I do think having a few functional ones scattered around the wasteland would be cool, like at AVR or the clinic in Harper's Ferry.  It's odd that you have this magic drinking fountain at Whitesprings.
---
Well considering my points are valid, and most of their's aren't. Yes, unlike mine in the eyes of some. Whether you like it or not. I guarantee you I can have more people back me up on this than most.
---
I had a conversation with another berserker about 2 months ago. So I don't remember.
---
Are you ever going to post that "proof"?
---
Bethesda shills jump at the opportunity to downvote
---
Expensive for whats offered not just expensive
---
meanwhile youre the one here crying and actually being a baby... figure it out Karen
---
I'm sure I read it somewhere that the masks would be an ultra rare drop on this Halloween event tho... 
---
First statement still strands. 
---
Compare the atomic shop outfits to you're Halloween rewards... 
---
You're kidding yourself on mate.
---
Fallout 1st members are not a protected class. You are incorrect on the interpretation of our rules.
---
Literally the opposite but go off.
---
Clearly, since you had them giving you gold before there was time to read.
---
Seriously?  I’m surprised you didn’t call him a paid shill.
---
No it's the truth. What many fail to understand in this sub is that you can like the game and still be constructive and expect more from the developer. Both can happen it's not one or the other
---
Except that the Xbox One X is proven to increase game performance. That's not anecdotal.
---
Yes but I feel that promises made by sales persons that there would only be cosmetic items in the atom shop was a big one for me.
---
Repair kits aren't just cosmetic, fridges aren't cosmetic and when / if they introduce the scrap box to the atom shop that isn't cosmetic.
---
I know you can earn them outside of the atom store, but what was sold to me was a purely cosmetic store.
---
Lmao, karen. They're the Karens. Finding literally anything to bitch about.
---
Imagine being this stupid. Thinking that it is the consumers fault that the corporation released a poor product.
---
Imagine if this mindset was used in other areas. Bought a new car? It's *your* fault that car isn't up to spec! You should have waited. No one should buy a new car. Imagine if no one ever bought a new car? How fucking stupid would that be, no one would make cars. But in your opinion, if you buy anything new, and it isn't as described that is your fault for believing the hype you rube!
---
Nevermind that this was the attitude in the gilded age and it let corporations run roughshod over people and is exactly why there are consumer protections now. It's almost as if you completed ignored the last 200 years of history and are astoundingly stupid.
---
Also ignores the fact that "hype" comes from the advertisements for the game themselves, which means that anything in them should realistically be present in the game itself (that's those pesky consumer protections laws at work again). Which means that you should be able to believe hype at least to an extent that the company promotes it. You shouldn't have to rely on third parties to determine if a company is telling the truth about its product, the company should just do that. And obviously in this case they didn't tell the truth, give the legal decisions that went against bethesda/zenimax and said they didn't. Such as this one in Australia, which ruled that zenimax broke the law, specifically that their product had a major failure and didn't meet the quality it should have. Zenimax also made a direct statement that they misled consumers.
---
But. I guess in your world, that just makes the consumer a sucker and the corporation has done nothing wrong!
---
Now that I've set you straight. Why don't you go back to bootlicking corporations. And let the folks who actually understand how things work have a conversation.
---
It’s even cooler in power armor. Mothman or the robot.
---
Thrill of the Grill will spawn a herd of radstags for an optional requirement for the daily. I'm pretty sure it spawns the herd before the player even starts it by talking to the chef, causing the toxic valley to be a mess of wildlife.
---
There are legitimate gripes.  But hell, we had consumers lieing as well.  Remember all the “I was banned for duping but I didn’t! I swear!” Bullshit. So it isn’t like these groups have any real moral authority to stand on themselves.  But now it’s literally anything you want to be angry about.  
---
Bethesda could come out and say “Look we went outside the box on this one and we obviously have aggrieved our fans. We won’t do it again.” And people would crucify them for it.  “Rawr! They didn’t offer refunds!” “Grrrr! That was a week apology” “Whaaaaa I’m making a Youtube video about this.” 
---
It’s a lose-lose proposition for them.  They knew this thing was a risk, they knew the only people who were going to stomach it were RPers like myself.  And they struck out on this one. It happens. They’ll move onto the next project and hopefully it’s better received by the public. But they aren’t going to come out and make any kind of statement now about it.  It’s better to just let it sizzle out.
---
The game isn't that bad. In fact it's quite good. I've enjoyed a lot of hours playing it.
---
However it could be way better than it is now. If this would guarantee a near perfect Fallout game hell yeah go for it. But it'd be foolish to do so without test servers. 
---
Let's face the facts many AS items have been released which were clearly never tested. If Bethesda has testers they're bad at thier job  
---
Let the players report the bugs on dedicated test servers during this period. I'm certain there's more than a few players who would gladly do this.
---
Because if they do something like this the game better be damn near perfect or it will crash and burn.
---
I mean, I got them in about 2 minutes. The TLDR is plenty long enough to give someone a very good understanding of what they need to know about this post.
---
I mean, I'm probably jaded from years of working with online fraud, but there are absolutely a large number of consumers who frankly don't care about the companies. I've worked with companies who, before they hired me, had about 15% dispute rate. Meaning 15% of all their sales were disputed, which can be a LOT of money. Only about 20% of those disputes (so ~3% of all sales) were either proper refund requests due to issues with the product, or actual cases of fraud (i.e. stolen cards). Losing ~13% of your sales due to people getting bored with the product after ~2-3 months of use, can be a big blow to a small business owner. 
---
Especially when many of these consumers will purposefully make big purchases, just to dispute them a month or so down the line when they want to spend the money on something else.'
---
So sure, I agree that you should regulate for the consumers, but I also believe there needs to be more protections for games as a service.
---
You do not have to be part of a "prtotected class" to be the victim of hate speech. 
---
Again, you need to step down as you do not understand basic human decency, this is not a political forum.  If a group of people is being targeted, that is in effect hate speech.
---
Hate speech is most common when it affects the protected classes, but hate speech is not limited to protected classes.   To think that it  does is ignorance at best, and would not hold up in a court of law.
---
Then since you have a very PC left leaning definition of hate speech, and claim that it cannot happen to one particular group because they are not considered a protected class, lets look at another part of rule #4
---
Harassment.
---
Moderate for harassment. 
---
It is not your decision what is considered harassment, it is the victims decision on whether harassment has occurred.   '
---
Yet you do nothing.
---
Thank you for showing your true colors though.  I appreciate it that you only follow your own rules when it serves your own purposes.
---
Bethesda/zenimax admitted to misleading customers. Australia is doing the right thing here. And any corporation that stands behind its product will have no problem releasing in Australia.
---
Imagine being so stupid as to think the corporation is the blameless one here when they admitted fault. Jesus.
---
Show what you currently have, with this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
I use explosive perks, but that's because I use a lot of granades, some mines and real explosive guns too. It is true for players who are only using guns with explosive legendary effect, the demo expert perk is quite wasteful. Have max 1 perk if that's the case.
---
And if you have like 8 int, you probably really don't need to, and could move those special points to something else.
---
In general bonus damage from different sources is better than bonus damage from one source, because the latter gets just added up while the first gets multiplied. That means, have at least one card on any damage increasing perk.
---
Are you blind? Look at the subreddit page, its repeat post after repeat post hating on Bethesda and fallout76 with high upvotes and cringe ass gold and silver for the most low effort bandwagon posts.
---
Yes. It's been taking around three minutes give or take for me to get into a world the last few days. Usually it's around a minute.
---
I think we need an "easy way out" button, but with a LOT of restrictions to prevent tryhards
---
Do you know is this only for people in Australia or everywhere? Because I contacted them for a refund before then but I am in the US. I assume I am still out of luck and out my $60 but maybe I will get lucky.
---
Did you even read the article? Zenimax/Bethesda broke Austrlian law. And admitted to misleading customers.
---
Imagine being on the multi billion dollar corporations side of the average person who was mislead. I can't imagine being so stupid.
---
I WANT TO SPEAK WITH THE MANAGER!
---
2/3 of my Legion outfit can be found in game. I’m just saying the football helmet.
---
&gt;would not hold up in a court of law.

This is not a court of law. This is reddit.
---
If you don't like our rules, you are welcome to leave.
---
much private.  very seclude.
---
Best part about all of this happening is it will filter out the vocal minority. Once these people are gone from the game and conversation things will improve.
---
If paying $100 a year has the benefit of making my game mostly troll free then, that alone, makes me happy.
---
I have paid for subs to other games that gave me nothing (looking at you Eve).
---
you have like 50hs of play with some bugs here and there and maybe some crash 
---
but on the media eyes that is BUGGED AS HELL, INCOMPLETE, NOTHING TO DO
---
oh but when they are talking about death stranding they are saying, IF YOU ARE OPEN MINDED AND PLAY 50hs this game ok (i see you yong yeah, i wish you were open minded before talk shit everytime about f76 i bet u never played not even 5hs)
---
Did fashnacht give full exp? I honestly don’t remember. Silos are also low exp. Not sure about SBQ and ISS. I’d have to say even what the case is, I see a lot bigger and more relevant stuff that needs improvements.
---
Mine too
---
Defend bethesda from getting shit on for communicating using community managers they hired to communicate to the playerbase?  
---
Sure.
---
Your post is at 45% downvotes and falling.  I am in complete agreement with everything you said. For a MUCH BETTER experience with a group of people who truly enjoy the game and a bunch of mods who keep it that way try r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
Slick edit, but you were talking about Bethesda as a whole in that paragraph and I'm just letting you know.
---
Also, since you changed the context with your edit why not make an edit note for that instead of just edit notes for gilding your own post? Lol
---
I mean if you look at that threads that's just one part of it. I'm talking about making comments on anything. You say anything negative about any facet of the game is down voted. 
---
But let's just agree to disagree.
---
Strange, his post won’t reach hot because the majority of people don’t agree...
---
I don't agree with you for the simple fact that I don't go by game reviews to determine what game I'm going to purchase.  If I did that with Fallout 76, then I never would have bought it, and for me, it turned out to be a great game.  I love it!  Just because some people don't like something, doesn't mean others won't.
---
I got the game in like December after it came out. I had heard that there were tons of bugs and figured 2-3 months for Bethesda to figure their shit out in their programming would be enough time. For the next 3 months I could not play for an hour without the game crashing or freezing. Was it frustrating? Yes, very. But I had played FO3, NV, FO4 and loved them all, so I thought I’d tough it out and wait for Bethesda to deliver the game I had been waiting for. It never came. Patch after patch reintroduced bugs that had been fixed and nerfed weapons that didn’t need to be nerfed and didn’t fulfill promises of upgrades to a variety of items. Topping that off with half finished quest lines (they released the burrows and the devs forgot to finish the quest), and a lack of new content, the rampant dupping in the game, and now the pass you can buy to have weightless junk and all that nonsense made it lose its fun and value to me. It became less and less about having fun and exploring the wasteland. So slowly but surely, I played less and less, and here I am now, moving on to games that actually function and deliver what they advertised. I wish the game had been another page in the fallout book that I love, but now it feels like a page I want to rip out of the book and forget about.
---
Dude.... It's not hard to get a refund for this game because it barely fucking works. Seriously.
---
No. Not guarantees. But beyond a reasonable doubt. It’s the same thing with antivaxxers.  They believe that “Big Pharma” is out to get them without having any evidence to back it. By your logic of not having “blind company faith” whenever a new vaccine comes out I should not get it until it’s been proven to be successful. Even if it’s already gone through the processes that prove it’s effectiveness.  Company integrity. Before fallout 76 bethesda had good company integrity (at least in what I’ve seen).  So there was no reason not to believe that this new game, that was said to be complete, was said to be good and “proven” by the games developers and testers, I should be able to trust that what they are saying is correct.  Buyers remorse caused by the broken integrity of a company is I believe a valid reason for a refund. And beyond that it’s law and there’s a reason it’s law. 
---
(Just a disclaimer, I know my analogy above isn’t perfect but just try to see the parts that are)
---
Relevant detail:
---
&gt; ZeniMax will offer to provide refunds to ***consumers who contacted them between 24 November 2018 and 1 June 2019 to request a refund*** and have not already received one.
---
Happened to me the other night. It's an eyebot
---
Need to place a large display case in your camp, then assign the power armour helmet to it
---
It is content, and is new, it may go away, but the fact is it is content and is new.
---
I agree with everything you said except: " You can't win a game that doesn't have a competitive goal. "  
---
That is horseshit and with that attitude it would be justified to start selling bloodied explosive gatling plasmas in the atom store.
---
They can downvote it to the negatives. My point was proven when they came here being little shitheads and arguing before they even tried to prove their points lol.
---
You just threatened to ban me for trying to have an intelligent debate?
---
Improper use of mod power sir.
---
Imagine being from Australia and thinking you represent the entire world.....
---
Your cousins from England say hi BTW.
---
&gt; Does the game run on your computer? Is it the game that was shown in the trailers? Congratulations, you're running their 'working product'. Whether that product is up to your personal 'snuff' is different. 
---
No... if they say the product "works" there is more than reasonable expectation that it does more then turn on and run on your PC. If you play 40 hours and can't continue because it's incomplete or defective then your might be entitled to a refund if the company can't repair the product in a timely manner.   
---
This is like MANY consumer protections... in the US there is a mandatory 1 year warranty from the date of purchase. Sure you have to give the devs the opportunity to fix the game... or deliver promised features.
---
To some extent I think the law needs to be updated to properly address software issues... changes that are made to the original product, defective, patch quality... etc. But I have no reason to treat games differently then any other product I purchase. There is a reasonable expectation it work... beyond able to turn on... and that advertised features aren't removed/unplanned. 
---
&gt; Okay, sure, immediately is fine, but for those who didn't, and waited months before trying to refund, I have no sympathy for them. They bought the product, used the product, and then got bored of it and want a refund. People want to refund now just to 'stick it' to the company. 
---
Immediately and if the product is discovered to be defective or misrepresented later. There is 0 reason consumers should be entitled to a refund. I agree if you didn't like the experience is an opinion. But if features/quality is misrepresented even if its updates that come later... then consumers should have the right to a refund. If they have the right to unilaterally change their commitments or features of something we purchase, then we too should have the right to get a refund after they modify our product.
---
I know.  Just try that other sub, have fun and don’t look back
---
So you believe corporations and companies should have more rights than individuals? I believe you're an idiot.
---
I'm sorry, could you point out where in their statement it says what you have asserted here, or is that just an extrapolation you've made?
---
Because that seems like a pretty far stretch from what I read.
---
Nope I got him one for being so right
---
until you provide documentation it is. Im not interested in going back and forth on anecdotal vs facts. Point is this game is built on old frame, like pulling junker out of the weeds painting it up real nice and selling it. underneath its broken. even before this event there were crashes. A lot of us cant run out and upgrade, and at this point why would I when every other game Ive played recently works just fine? oh yeah anecdotal...
---
Imagine posting actual drivel that has nothing to do with the conversation.
---
Bethesda broke Australian law and admitted to misleading customers. How do you even type when you must be so busy wiping their ass for them?
---
It's not though. $13 a month for 1650 atoms is already a better deal than usual. The rest just makes the value even better.
---
Doesn't seem to work. Does the large one need a plan? 
---
(And I did go right from the slanted one to get the big rectangle one)
---
I think those that get a refund and complain all the time should be banned from future play. 
---
If you hate something and can't stop going back to it a ban would keep you away.
---
Not at all. I illustrated a hole in your argument. Have a great weekend! We'll never be using your terrible enforcement ideas.
---
Law or not, if you've been playing the game for this long you got your moneys worth and deserve nothing back.
---
From OP on a different account
---
Revive does not break the stealth boy. I rezed a teammate in the middle of another squad last night and ran off. Probably freaked them but no angry messages.
---
The title alone was worth the gold
---
ACLU is about diversity in the workplace, not pay for convience items in a game.
---
Borderlands 3 no crashes, blackout(100 players in one server) no crashes, sea of thieves no crashes etc etc etc
---
Fallout 76 has crashed for me every event for the past 2 days, thats 30+ times. Xbox one s. its not the hardware. Yes better hardware can help but its not the cause. I have not played any other game in as long as i can remember that crashed as often as this.
---
And I understand that. But bethesda added in a new feature for a price that some people pay double monthly. If they were going to pay that much why not make a sub service with a discount and some extra perks. Don't want it? Don't buy it, the game will stay the same either way.
---
My point is that the way someone says something, and they way we read it in writing afterwards, can have very different meanings.
---
fun doesn't mean let's make a whole skill useless because people can't lockpick good.
---
Look at your downvotes, now look at your (likely self given) awards.  That should say something.
---
And Todd said that they shouldn't have done the BETA that way.
---
I'm in the UK, last time I checked they're from America? How could I possibly wipe their bottoms? Are you insane?
---
Thanks for the reply I didn't notice anything yesterday that said bonus when I wore it. I heard there's a box you can get costumes out of do you know where that location is?
---
I agree again. Half of those rage-baiters are all busy pretending to be in love with Outer Worlds anyway, so maybe the dust will settle. One thing we do know, is that it’s waaaaay too early for Bethesda to release an official statement on the 76 climate right now, not to mention the fact that said statement is a HUGE thing going forward. I would take my time with it too.
---
I do agree that most of the posts people make on the subject (positive and negative) are somewhere between incoherence and fantasy. However, that’s the price we pay for an open forum.
---
Yeah, that would be a bit far. But my point was that people are calling a sub service that adds some small features, with some included atoms that some people probably buy regularly, shitty. And in my opinion doesn't make sense because with or without this sub service the game remains the same at its core.
---
Ok boomer.
---
You're literally a dumbass. You need documentation to know that the upgraded console is...upgraded? Gtfo lol.
---
The downvote ratio lol
---
Sometimes the majority only means the idiots are on the same side.
---
PS4 PRO -- crashed once in the 10 or so times I've done it.
---
It’s not buyers remorse if the company deliberately lied and refused to deliver upon what was promised.
---
I've picked my 760 locks I just like blowing stuff up 😁
---
To be fair to those folks, the ACCC's headline was vague to the point where intentional sensationalism must be considered.
---
The media coverage of the ruling has honed in on that.
---
A nuanced reading of the ruling's contents is required.
---
Never purchased 1st, porbably won't despite wanting them atom points and the ranger outfit.  
---
1650 atoms a MONTH means you could save up each month, and have the purchasing power to buy the entire atom shop in a year or so, while 1650 seems small, it can grow huge in a couple months' time.
---
Batteries included/portable power or 5 ranks of gunsmith.
---
So you don't understand something as simple as the fact that a company can operate in multiple countries. I mean, even kids know this. Why am I not surprised.
---
Nobody gave me the mask or any candy! WTF!?!
---
I play Final FantasyXIV and pay the monthly sub without complaint. However, since launch they have added features that have drastically improved the game. They didn't put these things behind another paywall, another sub, or even to certain players. Even players that play the free trial can experience some of these changes. 
---
The developer clearly has respect and listens to the playerbase. They don't put features and items behind additional paywalls. Everyone plays the same game with the same experience.
---
I like to watch the ones who say “i quit” then you see them never quitting haha
---
You should.  You would have a much better regulated community with far less vitriol and hatred being spread around.
---
But maybe you guys want a sub full of hatred and deceipt.
---
&gt; because anything negative against Bethesda is downvoted by majority of the sub
---
And that's why crap posts like this get upvoted to the front page.  Wait...
---
I feel for the mod team- they are most likely walking on glass atm... but if someone doesn’t even play the game they shouldn’t be here.
---
You learn them easy enough....west tek, golf course, generals, robco....all these places have set spawn points and are easy to find and not hidden...I never have a random legendary disappear though...always seems to be the places like mentioned above
---
Because there are plenty of haters that slap on a downvote and go on. Then there are people who appreciate someone who understand (the people who awarded the post). Big difference. I can guarantee you I didn't give my self the gold. I mean, I got the 2 awards for gold and reddit premium literally today. No need to award a post for something that'll be downvoted into oblivion for no reason.
---
The fact you replied seriously to my clearly childish and sarcastic comment.....means I've already won this argument baby girl. Goodbye

They may have been made prior to the law coming into effect; the developers might not be aware of the CVAA requirements; the developers might have a different idea of what the CVAA specifies (it's kinda vague in some places); or they might simply be taking the chance that nobody will make an issue out of it.
---
Well throw grenades at a ghoul, asking for a safe blowing mechanic would not make the game fun for others.
---
&gt; Buyer's remorse should not be a valid reason for a refund.
---
That's the very basis for the concept of a refund.
---
"Oh, I bought this drill.  It's not everything I thought it was and I regret buying it."
---
You're telling me that I shouldn't get a refund for that drill?
---
Exactly. Surprisingly though some people have actually quit and turned into Karens, "I WANT TO SPEAK WITH BETHESDA AND GET A REFUND".
---
The fact that you don't understand simple sarcasm in my replies, means you're a fucking idiot. Oh. And if you have to tell yourself you won? You didn't win.
---
I think there will be no new outfit, but they will probably put other outfits “on sale” in the Atom Store for 1st members only. I hope I’m wrong and there’s a new outfit monthly though.
---
They deleted it themselves- don’t claim reddit censorship if you don’t even know how Reddit works.
---
When mods remove something it says “removed”
---
We have been trying to tell you this for weeks. 
---
But you could not hear over the sound of your own misery.
---
ESO was made by Zenimax Online Studios and PUBLISHED by bethesda SOFTWORKS
---
How bout instead of Fallout First it is called Fallout Fist. Cuz that's what they are doing to the players.
---
Take a look at hot.  There’s a reason they’ve got thousands of upvotes and awards.
---
Great story and new perspective. Very unique post 👍.
---
FO76 strikes again.  The one thing you can be sure of in this game is that different people have different experiences.  I also have a PS4 pro, I've played every night since the event came live and eight hours straight today.  One crash (bluescreen).
---
Ya I have like 40 of them. I didn't dupe any tho, I just bought from some guy who had 1000s
---
There was a limited firetruck skin for the excavator
---
A box that only holds junk is not fine..okay.
---
I hear the beep all the time. Well often, not all the time. Maybe like once per hour.
---
I recall it comes in somewhat similiar situations always, can't remember what though, it's like picking up an item or something like that.
---
I don't have crashes. PC.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer%27s_remorse
---
If you built it up in your head to be something it never was, and then disappointed yourself, then no, you should not get a refund.
---
Key word being sometimes
---
I didn't ask for it. I just said it would be fun. You can't say it wouldn't be fun.
---
Besides hacker and lockpick should be passive perks anyways.
---
Oooo, you used a swear word. You mad haha me the winner!!
---
I would leave everything as is.
---
I just did. 2 posts completely opposite of hating the game, have platinum. I have the most gold reward from my post up on the hot page.
---
Ok OP
---
If I tried making caps for repairing pa, I’d probably just get scammed time after time
---
Mwhahhahahaha food
---
The amount of people I met that say “I quit months ago” is insane.. why are you here then?
---
Lmao k. Your either a troll or a complete brainlet. Your call on which
---
Bethesda has not said, "Oh, subscribers get all the future DLC"  
---
They added a second CAMP (Within a team, you technically could have 4 already), a junkbox, a ranger outfit, and some icons and skins, and a private server, that's it for now.
---
Yeah totally fake account- just spent all this effort to make it to fool you- all for this moment.
---
Please continue to show us you have no idea how reddit works
---
OP was asking about pistols. This is the most powerful pistol build in the game right now. There's a reason a BE pipe revolver sells for stupid amounts on the trade forums. It's also quite fun. I have plenty of points for the sneak/crits I need as well as the requisite points for bloodied and mutated cards. I wish I had a point or two more in places, but I'm not really giving much up at all.
---
I do have to switch utility cards in and out when dealing with the vendorbots etc, but you shouldn't keep those on all the time anyway.
---
This is the "game" for them.
---
I’d swap demo for gunsmith, but that’s a matter of preference really. Looks solid to me
---
I don’t want to judge other people’s lives but I am going to- if you sit in this sub and whine all day about a game you don’t even play then you need to look inside yourself
---
Didn't you say goodbye?
---
Not gonna argue. Haven't seen a single person in this post justify themselves against the game. Maybe 1-2 but that's it. That's my point. So quick to hate, but they never take time to realize whats happening.
---
I've done the event about 30 times and haven't received a single rare outfit yet. My luck with the rare plans in meat week was pretty similar too, didn't land a single tato salad recipe or firework  on either week, and only got about 2 tenderizer mod plans.
---
They literally broke the law that doesn't matter.
---
Maybe you were their Stimpack. :o
---
So a guy on reddit claims to work at AAA company and wants Bethesda to stop adding in new content (That comes with patches), and a remove a subscription service that has 0 effect on the game's stability or anything regarding bugs, and spend 3 months fixing bugs when they've been fixing bugs all this time?
---
Money wise.
---
This doesn't seem like a cool thing to say. Then again, nothing's tougher than saying that behind a keyboard, so I defer to you 🤦‍♂️
---
I believe they are looking into public test servers that that’s a plus. If they did this and did it well it would hopefully breathe new life into the game.
---
Lies, the team does give a fuck. Sometimes bugs can slip by. Developers are not robots, they will make mistakes, they will learn and fix it.
---
A) It's just not feasible to do all the upkeep and maintenance while losing money. That's just not reasonable. We can want it to all not cost money, but it does, and I understand why it does. 
---
B) Overall the game was really great for what it was. There's no other game quite like it. There actually is a really in depth, rich storyline to follow, with equally rich side quests. People just never bothered to look into then deeper than completing the quests. If you took the time to read all the holotapes/notes etc left behind, it was really descriptive. This game takes place only 25 years after the bombs dropped. There's still another 175 years before any of the other games take place. It makes sense that most of the people are dead in game. The ones that "survived" are all scorched or ghouls, super mutants. That's what West Tek is, the super mutants take people there and dip them in the green stuff. You either die or turn. Same concept from other games too.
---
C) I mean. He who inseminated giveth, and he can taketh away. Lmao
---
welcome to the club
---
Not exactly correct.  They listen to the feedback that they think will make them more money. 😛
---
Sucks to suck
---
You sound like you just want the game to make things easier for you.
---
Why do you feel the need to lie about this? It's not remotely comparable.
---
**FF14's monthly subcription literally prohibits you from playing the game *at all* without paying the sub.** Fallout 1st is NOT mandatory to play the core game.
---
Read literally every thread on this sub that isn't licking todd Howard's asshole.
---
Anyone can have multiple accounts for whatever the reason being.
---
People act like this type of service is a new idea. Sorry to say, its not
---
That will never happen. This is not a law that only exists for video games it's a general consumer protection law. If what you said was the case NO ONE would do business in Australia.
---
Yeah but I hid round the corner, so I could waste more of your time while you comment on a game/company you clearly don't like.
---
Instead of you going out and getting some friends.
---
I mean....... How empty does your life have to be, when you get to the point that commenting on a forum, for a game you don't like....is all you have.
---
Really? What 25% are you comparing this too? Everyone is stuck on the $100 thing, but that's only because it makes it sound slightly worse. That's $100 for a whole year, and just the atoms you get from it are more than worth it.
---
My account is clearly established and a separate account. Anyone that isn’t stupid could see that.
---
Jeez I know people act shitty when nobody the know is watching but that is worse than I would've guessed.  Ultimately I agree that it needs to be a two way street.  Despite being a socialist by nature I think cyclical policies are the only sustainable solutions.  Stagnation allows for bad actors to do their worst whether or not it's the consumer or business.   
---
Thanks for disagreeing via idea man.  It was a pleasure even if we still don't agree :)
---
We want a sub where users are free to express their opinions without making personal attacks and understand where the line is drawn at all times.
---
We have that.
---
Making the enforcement of Rule 4 be based on individual targets' opinions of harassment would not present any standard that users could expect, turning this community into an argument-free safe space for yes men.
---
That is based on years of volunteer and professional experience in this area.
---
This is the end of our discussion. Good day.
---
That'd be nice the players are significantly better at finding bugs than Bethesda.
---
As much as that was crappy of them it's also hella funny.
---
As someone that runs the Cannibal perk:  
---
DYK? The button to Stimpack someone when they're down and the button to cannibalize them are both R? DYAK that Cannibal takes priority?
---
I've accidentally eaten people when I intended on giving them a res with booze. Because it's *all the same button*, and when I'm being shot at by several hundred things, I'm not going to check, "Shit, do I have Cannibal on right now or did I tag it out?"
---
Someone mistakenly ate you. Get over it.
---
God you are desperate to try and get a W aren't you.
---
I don't think you have any grasp of how the real world works lol gotta be honest there. Your entire "argument" is based on silly conjecture and conspiracy ranting.
---
Bump
---
Wtf is this world coming too...
---
Go buy any game.... Wait a year, and it will. Be 80% cheaper.
---
Welcome to life.
---
Just like every word you've written lmao the guy has a better argument than you do haha
---
most likely
---
Will do. I’ll be having fun with my friends in a game I enjoy while you pound on a keyboard ineffectively on the Internet. Enjoy your life!
---
Nice use of name calling to veer off of the topic
---
If you don’t play the game why are you even here
---
I mean, almost all games go down in price after a while. It’s now a year old. 
---
That’s the gamble of pre-ordering. If this is honestly your biggest woe in life then you’re doing fine.
---
Holy shit, I’ve been using my tent wrong! How does one go about making it a sex tent? Does the front zipper closed?
---
I'm not down voting your comments.... So you tell me!!
---
Yeah.... no..... I didn't get through picking 760 locks by not switching perks. I can change perks very quickly it's not a problem. 
---
Would I like to free up the time it takes to switch said perks? Yes, who wouldn't.
---
this evening i took someone's loot during the event, but i thought you dont lose loot then
---
It isn’t my fault you are trying to claim everything that isn’t truth- Reddit censorship (denied) alternate accounts (denied)
---
Smarten up and stop being so deceiving (you are horrible at it anyways) if you don’t want to be called out.
---
Yep. PS4 pro here. Crashing seems to be a part of the event ahaha goddammit Bethesda you lazy fucks.
---
I am curious why you care
---
Gosh, you people are getting real annoying. Either get it, don't get it, or bugger off and uninstall - but no matter what you do, shut up, have some maturity, and do it in silence without trying to rally some kind of internet ego for your, "bold", expression of.. "temerity".
---
It's a shame to see someone ask for help...real help...and idiots in here use it as a way to bash Fallout1rst...some people never grow up...act your age not your shoe size
---
So you want everyone to have a unlimited stash weight box, and be able to host their own serves when the server stuff is AWS, not bethesda, Bethesda doesn't own the servers they run for 76, they pay for usage through Amazon, also Subscription services are supposed to have names like that, Spotify PREMIUM, Pandora PREMIUM, you're getting shit the nonsubs dn't get, sorry that it feels like classism.  
---
Private worlds will probably get settings options in the future, just not now.
---
Watch the interview. He says the same exact same words as the quote and i shared the whole quote so it would not be taken out of context, which is what you are talking about
---
No, it’s not fine. Not when every day for nearly a year, you’ve had players practically begging for stash space relief—a limitation that we were told was necessary for stability. That was a lie. Scrap items always could’ve been unlimited. The only reason they weren’t was so they could release this “Feature” behind a paywall. 
---
Creating an artificial problem only to sell a solution is unethical. We wouldn’t accept it with any other product, so there’s no reason it should be acceptable here.
---
Thanks for being a shining example of why the "AAA" gaming industry is getting so bad!
---
I'm guessing this is a poor attempt at a troll? What betrayal are you talking about? 
---
Bethesda fucks consumers over, consumers stand up for themselves, somehow that equals betrayal?
---
1) I revealed minor details about internal processes. This could get me blacklisted if they figure out who I am. Also I WORKED at, past tense.
---
2) The subscription service barely even worked/works so yeah, remove it. It needs to be further tested. People are lying a subscription fee to basically be pre-alpha testers on it.
---
3) Stopping new content will allow EVERYONE (artists, sound guys, etc) to focus on testing and reporting bugs essentially multiplying their QA team.
---
4) They’re incredibly slow at fixing bugs for an online live-service game. It takes months to get major issues fixed (hello raid wiping and stuck power armor) and 30% of the time they reintroduce these major bugs with future updates (hello every PA bug that’s ever been in the game). They keep falling behind on bug fixing and at this rate they’ll never catch up.
---
Again you can’t stop using “personal attacks”.
---
Lol that’s kinda funny
---
+karma
---
"Bethesda's servers"  
---
People do know that bethesda doesn't run the F76 servers right?  
---
They were paying Amazon to use AWS servers.
---
Keep whining. 
---
CENSORSHIP
---
Typical reddit, downvote for 100% factual post.
---
No. If you read everything I said, it would be host ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM where as the servers in fallout 1st would have more customization and always be on.
---
you and your insults. Im sure you calling me names wins this argument. Go find someone else to attack who has made a complaint about this broken game that just works. Im sure you can win that one to. See ya
---
Why?
---
Look, we might disagree now, but when they come for us gamers (and they will), me and OP will still be there to put our lives on the line to defend all of you guys.
---
Semper fi, gamers.
---
That ruling wasn't based on misleading customers, it's because Zenimax refused to give refunds and Australians have a right to request a refund, within a reasonable amount of time. Had nothing to do with the state of the game.
---
It Is part of game mechanics. Just have a laugh and enjoy. The event is fun.
---
The subtitles for the radio plays are awful: *Radio Drama plays*
---
Not Bethesda's fault. You forget that Sony has cracked down on modding back when Fallout 4 had it built in for consoles. That's why they created the Creation Club.
---
That would be perfect!
---
These events are about the limited time items. If there are enough people participating you don't have to fight the sentry bots to complete the event
---
Actually I'm sure most of the money goes to the modders and some modders have stated as such, and it ain't bethesda's fault that sony's a big bitch about modding.
---
Same. Shelling out for the Tricentennial Version and seeing the game half price in a month was a kick in the nuts. I haven't played for months now.
---
Uranium Fever items are level 35-40. Baseball bats are crap. 2 or 3 star are only as good as the 2nd or 3rd attribute. The harpoon gun sounds good though. How much is Bethesda paying you to LIE!
---
Okay, my point obviously isn't being made. 
---
I'm saying that the spoken word and written word can be the same but mean different things, via tone, surroundings, circumstances.
---
I believe the intent was the DLC and new core features of the game would be free, and those have been.
---
Is it stealing? Op is literally giving them the idea
---
doesn't matter Bethesda broke the law
---
I think you need Max rank ground pounder.  Its a great perk for autos and works with semi auto rifles too.  I would sacrifice on of those max commando cards for it.  As long as you have Rank 1 in all commando cards you get the biggest bang for your buck.  
---
Otherwise this is pretty good.
---
Pick a thread any thread. It’s all the same. Let me clarify. Let me explain. 
---
How about I mean what I said how I said it and you don’t like oh well. Paper skins these days ... ignore em
---
It's a reddit myth, just like the trade-steal exploit BS. Youtubers really need to stop just reiterating what's been posted on the subreddits, cause some of it's lies my guys.
---
This whole post is about these people...
---
I would like to be able to bottle the water from whitesprings
---
I agree.
---
Everyone is acting like a bunch of "Todd"lers acting like the service itself is bad.
---
The only issue here is that Bethesda mislead us. People need to get over it already, Fallout 1st is genuinely a pretty good deal
---
Knock knock
---
After what they did with the creation club, id say it is
---
Pay to win only has as much power as you let it. I'm not buying Fallout 1st, and I'm not buying whatever new Bethesda games that come out. They're as dead to me as Konami and EA (we'll see about Fallen Order).
---
In the gazebo structure where you light the beginning bonfire, there's a red trunk which contains a clown hat and a tinfoil hat. Most costumes require a hat to be "complete".  The end rewards won't say "bonus", but there should be 5 different lines of stuff listed. The last one will say something like plan: classic jack-o-lantern, or plan: full pumpkin rack, or it will list a costume (fireman outfit, pirate costume, etc).  I've found that if I'm not in a "full costume", the game will put a quest marker on the gazebo chest and top of screen will say something about donning a costume.
---
Been quite a while since you've had one I imagine.
---
Yeah, I’ve seen that eyebot around a few times in various random encounter locations. The morse is a little faster than I can translate so I’m not sure what it’s saying but I assume it’s just “responder here. Go help the responders” or something.
---
they are both viable.  Gunsmith will be better for repair costs. 
---
Demo will be better for a bit  more damage.
---
I actually use GS instead of DE myself too, but thats mainly because I dont use an explosive bloodied bulid, I use a sniper bloodied build with +10 aiming instead.
---
Not really, I mean. Look, a game company changes. Bethesda stuck behind and lost money. Zenimax was tired of it. And done what every other online game company has done. And made money off of something. Don’t like it? Don’t play it. You haven’t been and aren’t going to be forced to play it.
---
1.  The level of his lockpick skill is irrelevant -- if he picked the lock he would be wanted, you could TWEP him with no problems.
---
2. Why didn't he just fast travel?
---
It's OK, this discussion has come to an end. Welcome to British humour......sarcasm is hard to grasp.
---
But thank you..... Sheldon.
---
1) Coool.
---
2) verify your sources bucko. Some people have said it hasn't, but the majority 1st-ers have had their subs for a while now.
---
3) Cool, but then people will get mad that bethesda isn't making new content or working on wastelanders, there's no pleasing anyone in the bethesda toxic section
---
4) Slow, because of how many bugs are being found, and sometimes bugs slip past or something you add recreates a bug, it's ievitable that sometimes there's gonna be bugs, bethesda is focused on the bigger fish first thenthe small fish.
---
Good to see bad business practices get punished and called out for their lies. People who tout how they spend money on "digital nothings" make everything worse no matter how they try to justify it, Fallout 76 won't be around but maybe another year, not because of lack of micro transactions, but because Bethesda will start charging to play on their servers in general and use the excuse of "we need more funds to keep the game alive...by that point no one will be interested and have moved on because most will realize the game is too shallow to pay a sub fee.
---
They obviously delayed Wastelanders to make it a good DLC, sooo....moot point.
---
Make sure to cancel your sub, otherwise it will re-new next month
---
Because Bethesda, I guess
---
A quick dive into OP and OPs alt account appears to show 73% similar word choice, graphs with the same comment+post activity over time, one being a gaming account and other more leisure and personal. 
---
Not to mention both being rated highly controversial.
---
Well, giving everyone an unlimited stashbox also sounds crazy.  
---
Personally this is a Pay For Convience thing since the scrapbox only holds junk and scrap.
---
Why do they call it hate speech if you love it
---
Good on you bro! To anyone considering this I encourage you to do the same
---
Not to mention both being rated highly controversial
---
Nice try, PR shill!
---
... unless?
---
Yes dude watch the interview and make that call for yourself. 
---
Your point is called context and you are not wrong but he also said the exact word you say they didn't, so you are also wrong. You are spreading misinformation that you put no effort into seeing if it was actually true
---
Then ask for perk loadouts, not blowing up safes.
---
Actually there is very little evidence to support your supposition,
---
Alt account? Explain. Because right now you’re making no sense.
---
Lol my account is an everything account- I just been playing the game more. Like I said anyone who is not stupid can see I am a totally separate person with multiple years of history behind my account.
---
Plus I upvoted OP- if you upvote yourself that’s against reddit rules and I would be banned.
---
So once again- quit being deceiving you are not good at it.
---
That made my day, that is hilarious
---
Saving this thread so that we know who to raise pitchforks at if it gets atom shopified.
---
Omg there’s a sex tent in the game, take my money now😍
---
Legally, not very many.
---
FO4’s perk system was garbage too. Bring back FO3’s/NV’s, and I’ll be able to get behind that.
---
No I removed it lol.
---
Bethesda has said maybe Workshops will be persistent in the future, so...maybe.
---
&gt; have some maturity, and do it in silence
---
You first mate :)
---
You must be an older sibling! Ha!
---
Why don't I?  Because the game is a fucking blast.  Why the hell would I stop playing?
---
Op's post was about blowing up safes. 
---
I just said it would be more fun than lock picking.
---
My bad, why may I ask?
---
&gt;They bought the product, used the product, and then got bored of it and want a refund. People want to refund now just to 'stick it' to the company.
---
If companies want to use the model of "live service" games and still charge cost of entry, they shouldn't be surprised if refund requests for that cost of entry come in months down the line when the "live service" aspect of the game isn't up to peoples' standards or wasn't what was promised initially. If FO76 was a standard FO title, I'd agree that getting a refund after so much time would be stupid, but it's not...peoples' refund requests in this scenario are entirely justifiable.
---
If it's being taken out of context, then it's not misleading. I keep saying the promised DLC would be free. Not that a scrap box and portable tent would be, as neither can really be called "new". They are both just different, premium versions of things that already exist. 
---
They DID backtrack on cosmetic only though.
---
Idk why not
---
Don’t worry about downvotes. Bethesda’s bots are pretty active lately. We all know why.
---
So you're asking to be getting free shit because you played the game when some of us, like myself, are lifelong fallotu and bethesda fans and don't feel entitled to shit?  
---
Get a fucking life, stop with your entitlement.
---
Zenimax actually.  Bethesda don't make decisions at this level.
---
(Yes, to some extend they're the same people but Zenimax answers to the investors).
---
Pretty epic I’ll do the same
---
&gt;For example, what happens if another company takes over the game in the future like Everquest going from Sony to Daybreak? 
---
Same thing as with any other service. The customers transfer, the obligations transfer. It happens all the time.
---
&gt;how does that work for perhaps the minority that liked it as it was? Can the company never change direction?
---
That wouldn't matter a thing.
---
I am...
---
The service is bad when you consider that oct 1st the survival servers were cut, then we find out wastelanders got delayed, but hey look, fallout 1st...
---
It was a misallocation of time and resources that'd be better spent elsewhere.
---
Gotta love how everyone ignores the fact your game crashed and how that is normal game behavior.
---
Some stockholm syndrome level shit here
---
I just posted it to my Xbox feed. Don’t have time to fuck with YouTube at the moment.
---
That's 2 of 3 requirements. I'm assuming you don't know the plan heh.
---
So many spiders.
---
The crafting menu will show what’s missing, for intance, is your gunsmith card equipped and high enough of a level? Are you the minimum level to make the pistol itself?
---
A tent and a stashbox is not DLC dumbass  
---
DLC is stuff like a whole fucking gamemode, some new quests, new outfits, two new events, a new creature, new weapons and a camera item.
---
I get that, but I still personally like the concept of a online fallout game just as much as a single player fallout game. I will continue to keep a eye on 76 unless they continue adding ptw items and the like like fallout 1st. But yes, 76 should have been delayed for at least another year or more.
---
I'll edit the post to include that. I'd just like something better than this current card system.  :)
---
Well, we did find out that all the revenue from Fallout 1st is actually making developing Wastelanders go by more smoothly and more efficiently
---
The problem with #3 is that people don't want to pay for cosmetic items, they want to pay for utility. No cosmetic that could exist in the game will change that.
---
Sigh...
---
Dont listen them its perfect the way it is
---
Dude, the post is at +896.  What downvotes.
---
Private servers worth the money no more Jagoffs
---
Hi Todd.
---
If I were modifying this for my play style.....
---
Five strength, 2 Bandolier and 3 to play with.  Three charisma, 2 LoneWanderer and 1 Traveler or 3 HardBargain.  Drop Agility to 12 and move points over to luck.  Drop thru hiker completely and put it all in Adrenaline.  Lots of power in criticals so I’m going with FourLeafClover and possibly BetterCriticals.  Drop class freak, don’t need it. 
---
Use Unyeilding gear to boost stats.  My mutations, Adrenal, Healing Factor, Eagle Eyes, Marsupial, Carnivore.  Possibly speed demon, but frankly I get along ok without it, the faster reload speed would be the advantage for me.  
---
Again, this is how I would change it to work better for my style.  I don’t like carrying too much aid or food, and those perk cards just take away from damage.  I focus on killing faster so I don’t need to heal as much.  With Carnivore I can eat as I go, no need to carry lots of food.  Inert Flux for water, it lighter.
---
Sure thing, the title screen will be changed back to the original video in Patch 15!
---
I hardly ever have those issues (PS4). I have had times where it was worse before, and it was either because of a looooong friend list, ore because someone bear me had a poor connection, and the Creation Engine just isn't designed to properly reconcile that. 
---
They really should have changed the engine, probably to Havok like ESO. It would have changed the way the game is played, but it would have handled the concept better.
---
I was with you up to F2P NW. Let's not do the Fortnite thing. Adventure mode will suffer.
---
Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not happening.
---
&gt;I'm seeing a lot of downvotes...
---
[There's literally a post from 10 hours before yours about this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpy1gc/australian_court_rules_that_some_customers_are/). Might be people are downvoting you for the obvious karma grab of making your own post instead of commenting on the existing post about the topic.

So you are telling me, if I bought a new car from a dealership, it runs, and drives like it should, but the gauges on the dashboards are inaccurate, the car occasionally dies and has to be restarted, the built in heated seats that were advertised as a feature is actually just a button that does nothing, and you only get 15 MPG when it was said to be 35MPG, that you arent entitled to a refund for that vehicle?
---
😂 you're right this is the only post on the whole sub. Why don't you pull off those rose-colored glasses

I'm ok with map expansion (but not recycled areas) and faction war. Would love that. 
---
The rest, I personally disagree. 
---
I do want perk presets though, which were announced already. 
---
I strongly disagree with time travel.
---
I'm at work now, so recreating this from memory, but here's my general build.

---
This is good news for Australians! Good for you guys!
---
Yeah, yeah.
---
I just take that as workshops stay active as long as someone is still in the server.  I want them to allow you to whitelist people so they can play whenever even if the owner isn't online just like in Minecraft Realms.
---
Half payment up front half after. most people dont try to scam the repair man. Plus i work for caps ammo or other trades. If a price cant be hashed out i refuse the work haha
---
ESO was a broken mess.  
---
FF also has a sub service and that mmo had to be RERELEASED.
---
Ah. That’s smart. 👌
---
Where have you been, People have been asking for new atom shop stuff before Fallout 1st.
---
2 copies and 3 atom bundles for the costumes doesn't keep a game like this running. Be mad, but it's for no good reason. The subscription will finally give the game the revenue stream it needs to improve.
---
&gt;Get rid of perk cards,
---
No. That's how 76 words, it's a nice idea and honestly I hate Fallout 4's chart. Plus they said perk loadouts are coming.
---
&gt;2. EXPAND. THE. MAP.
---
There are a lot of empty spaces to fill and locations to flesh out before going somewhere else.
---
&gt;Forget this whole "people coming back to re-settle" thing.
---
Again, no. Games are a story, that's not how storytelling works. The theme of this game is resettling and rebuilding shortly after the bombs fell. This is not Fallout 5, a game set in the proper time will come.
---
&gt;4.
---
All things that can be explored in Fallout 5.
---
Fallout 76 can grow while still being Fallout 76, there is no need to throw everything away. Even once Wastelanders hits there is still next year and hopefully the ones after that to grow and expand the game, its story and the direction it should be going.
---
Are you on PC? If you are you can swap the music files. One of my friends replaced *every* song with Big Iron for a bit...until he got annoyed.
---
Stop dying

Perk cards (you) perception/refractor [i use 3]

See you say this because there is no way you can prove I am using this account, nor is there a way I can prove I don't.  You pretend to use percentages and shit like you know what you're talking about but in all honesty you don't. I use this very reddit account for all needs. Why would I need 2? You claim to have reasoning for me giving myself gold but you seem to be making a big deal out of nothing. I mean literally. Why would I give myself gold. It does nothing for me. Literally. Nothing. So I don't get where this is coming from. If I wanted premium or something I'd buy it. I don't. It's useless to me. I don't even use reddit enough to need it. Go elsewhere with you little "quick dive" bullshit. You aren't fooling anyone lol.
---
I'm thinking to get everything quickly and easily, we'd need to skip ahead a bit. I'm not sure I trust the developers to get things "right" by themselves.  Re-cycling already established areas might speed them along to truly new content (NYC would be an amazing area to explore). Thanks for commenting!
---
To be fair, it might not have been his decision.
---
Persistence means sticks around. Workshops will stay the same when you log off and back on.  
---
Just because Realms does something doesn't mean bethesda has to do it.
---
Where was that posted?
---
Bethesda literally comitted fraud by false advertisement of their product.
---
1) You wrote this. "Why not err on the side of the consumer though? By percentage they almost always stand to lose the most when businesses behave poorly."
---
That is what I was responding to, not the main topic.
---
2) A straw man is defined as thus, "A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent."
---
You asked a question, I gave my opinion with reasoning. You attacked it for lack of evidence. I countered that the evidence is common fucking sense with an example. I was conversing on the topic presented. There is no straw man, you can't actually counter what I said so you're making up excuses to just dismiss it.
---
3) The reason there aren't examples is because traditionally, people didn't just memorize facts in school but got taught how to think logically. 
---
Because of critical thinking skills, people realize full well that if they do A, people are going to do B because B is human nature and they don't need someone to fuck up to know it. 
---
That has changed, people aren't taught logic but feelings in school nowadays which is why you even had to ask the question in the first place.
---
4) The only one who is triggered is you, you can't handle a different opinion than yours and have zero critical thinking skills.
---
If you had said skills, it might have occurred to you that the reason there aren't examples is because these policies exist in the first place!
---
Yeah, but still. He at least has hindsight.
---
I just did this to some guy on PC. Its pretty fun.
---
Yeah everyone loves the guy who eats half his meal and throws a fit and demands a refund because it was overcooked. Surely a fair question. Glad people are getting refunds, but not if they played the game for 20 hours first.
---
It's one thing to try out a game for an hour or two, realize it doesn't meet your expectations or is broken, and want to return it. It's a different story altogether if you play it for like 30 hours and then want to return it. If you play it t for that long, then you have received a fair value from the game, and you shouldn't be allowed a refund at that point.
---
How Bethesda could earn my money: Be an actually competent game dev...
---
Im not entirely sure, i heard it from the youtuber Juicehead, he seems pretty reliable. 
---
I dont remember the exact details but basically some article was made talking about it or something.
---
Don't feel bad for Zenimax or BGS, they've made millions, maybe billions by now with all the combined IPs they have. I feel bad for the people who love renting from the Atom Shop, you don't own a fucking thing but still keep forking over the dough...you ruin games and show these assholes there is are idiot buyers for their idiot market...
---
I wear the winter mask, it looks sweet with the blue shirt and slacks
---
 I've been eating people every chance I get.
---
You don't lose your loot during events so it's all in good fun.
---
It's Halloween.
---
One time the game was so laggy, I stimpacked a dude. He gave a heart emote, but the prompt for executing was still there so I ate him.
---
re: White Knight, I'm around level 110 or so, and I took it off once I hit level 70ish. By that point, I had tons of extra junk and materials anyway, and you don't have to worry so much about repairing armor if you just kill stuff faster. (Likewise, I removed all of my weight reduction perks around the same time, and now that the backpacks are out and you probably have most of the map explored, you -really- don't need to use them mid to late game.)
---
&gt; Just because Realms does something doesn't mean bethesda has to do it.
---
I never said they had to what. What I said was that I'd sign up in a heartbeat for the service if they made it work like realms does where I can authorize the 8 people I want to be able to play with and they can log on at any time even if I'm not on.  And to be honest considering Realms is cheaper and supports more people, it's asinine that they don't allow you to do this.
---
&gt;C) They haven't lied about anything, and they said &gt;before that they get a lot of their ideas from right &gt;here on reddit. That's actually where the &gt;subscription idea came from (originally from ESO) &gt;but it was brought up here in this forum more than &gt;once.
---
Never said that. I was responding to your comments.
---
How basic refunds are being handled absolutely shows the state of the game.
---
The losses are all what they care about instead of fixing the game.
---
Could I get a link to those leaks, please?
---
Lmfao you're delusional my friend.  Read your past sentence again.  What the actual fuck?
---
No, it would be a dream come true. I’m on the fence on you being senile though.
---
I don’t think you get it
---
That being said, a $60 live service game that has minimal content, extensive bugs and crashes and cancels its DLC isn’t worth it for me either
---
Not once have I been attacked on pc, despite spamming emotes. I actually have only gotten thumbs up.
---
Since fucking when??? This whole sub burns BGS on the regular
---
I doubt it'll end up that way, but NW is absolutely unplayable in its current state. If making it free is not an option then they should throw away the battle royale aspect and turn it into something that needs fewer players per instance, like the online modes of games like Call of Duty and such.
---
You do realize that paying for something is paying for something. Literally providing the company with the funds to give you shit. You pay for a private server, the funds you provide gives them the ability to financially support those servers. The unlimited stash is possible, is it expensive? Yes. That's why the ratio of what you're paying for is so simple. You're paying them to upgrade their systems so that you can have more shit. You want unlimited storage? pay for it. That shit is expensive on someone who doesn't have top tier servers for their game. I'm not fully for it but when the game sales are low and they don't have anything but atoms to support them and those sales are relatively low you have to take into consideration how much it would cost them to run top tier servers for a small game with tons of shit.
---
Old age is no longer "creeping", it's coming at me full tilt.
---
Troubleshooter's armor increases damage dealt to robots.  When the sheepsquatch imposter is vulnerable to attack, there are 10 people shooting it all at once.  Increasing my personal damage won't make that much of a difference.
---
That might be setting the bar a bit too high. :)
---
I haven't played since Mischief Night started, but it doesn't sound like this is going to be very forgiving for little ol' level 8 me. 😬
---
I downvoted *your* little contribution here, not because I work for Bethesda (I don't) but because you're a prat.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UjAEOjdsg
---
Watch this video
---
Umm since forever? It's always been like that. I can't even count how many times I've had to remove a post that I put because it was being critical of the game or Bethesda and I got downvoted so much I was worried that my karma was going to drop 500 points. It happens. If you want to stick your head in the sand that's fine
---
I agree to an extent, but unfortunately that's the way its going.
---
Theres crappy games in the mobile app store making more money off micro transactions than epic titles like fallout new Vegas, assassins creed and any gran turismi etc.. Combined!!
---
Fallout 76 is but a blip on the radar that is the gaming world today.... Its sad. I agree....... But it's optional. You don't have to buy it to enjoy this game.
---
Okay thanks a lot that's pretty specific. I know I used a tinfoil hat in one of them and an owl mask in the other which I noticed the plan you're talkin about so I must have got in the bonus for that one
---
&gt;NW is absolutely unplayable in its current state.
---
You must be on PC? I play on PS4 and it's seems fine to me. Not perfect but not awful. I always get 48-52 players a match as well.
---
I'm inclined to believe that you've never actually played Fallout 76.
---
The event is fun when you get completion of it.... My game literally circled around my corpse and I could not respawn/revenge/ignore...
---
yeah no shit thats why your dad was sucking me off
---
It's a public event, you don't lose your loot.
---
QQ
---
f you even smell like you're supporting BGS you'll get downvoted lol
---
So, you have no actual source for that statement?
---
As someone who likes Fallout 76 everyone who bought it should be able to get a refund. No game should be released in such a broken state. It's like buying a fridge but all the shelves are broken and it doesn't work half the time.
---
Yup.... and its not that it 'crashed' I had to FORCE CLOSE the game because I couldn't respawn/get revenge. The camera circled around my body and I could still see action taking place.
---
I'll find it
---
Thank you. :)
---
With Bethesda's recent announcements of future games development, I think FO5 is at least several years away. :(  Just thinking that with as much flak as the game seems to get, perhaps a "start over" option might have to be considered. I agree with you, though, that the 76 story could be a good one, but I'm growing despondent about the current devs and their roadmap. Really hoping I've missed some subtle cues that will prove me wrong. Thanks for commenting!
---
Do you think they would ever revisit this franchise in the future? If they are making a good profit that means most players are purchasing items from the atom, subscriptions, etc... which means that it really is what the player base wanted, we just don’t see the transactions occurring.  If they don’t that means it was too expensive to deal with the constant work on the game and the PR nightmare.  If I were them I would not revisit this property for at least a decade...unless of course the players are really enjoying it.  So basically give them what they want that you can do.
---
Stop dying??? Oh you mean when you are targetted because you HAVE to get close to get a shot in to claim loot?
---
So you only got 300 hours of entertainment from a game so now you gotta start stealing.  Gamers are such trash people.
---
Also, to you. I want to mention that the whole "cosmetics only" bullshit. You do realize the only things that aren't cosmetic provide the slightest, and I mean the SLIGHTEST advantage to the game? Again, haters with their shitty fucking backup stories that are so invalid and useless it funny. As for the servers I'll tell you the same thing I tell everyone else. Severs are expensive, so are upgrades such as storage and processing power. 
---
Here is a good explanation.
---
You take a combat rifle that is one thing to add into the file
---
you take that combat rifles file and add another file saying bloodied to it. that makes 2
---
you take any combination of perks and legendary affects to that weapon and they keep adding up into thousands of combinations between weapons and items. That takes a lot. Especially for the fallout servers considering how unstable they are now. So take into consideration how much each person paying for their own server is helping them pay for those servers they need. If this game had the players they planned it to have this would've happened earlier and smoother.
---
I lose my loot/quest credit when I have to forcibly quit my game cuz it froze...
---
May I ask how old you are?
---
To be honest they did not owe you anything because you willingly paid for the game. Congratulations on the refund anyway! But that refund or better said no refund policy from Bethesda for fallout 76, shouldn't be like this, everyone has the right to refund something they don't like or it's not meeting their expectations or when it is not as it was advertised. I support the game but I don't support what they did with this refund policy. I think and it's only my thought that they probably did it in order to be on the safe side, they maybe didn't have enough money to bring the game to the state it should be on the release, that's why they sold it anyway collected the money to get money and develop it further. Which didn't exactly go like this. But just as I said it's only my thought. I still support the game and hope it'll get better and get more content or side missions like a proper RPG when we get the npcs, because now we only got the main quest line and that's all no other quests just some little ones. But not much. I hope we'll get a proper RPG game when wastelanders dlc comes finally out.
---
Wah?
---
Funny that the game wouldn't let me respawn and had to force quit? Absolutely hilarious.
---
lolz stand up comedian in training here \^
---
If the game camera was circling your body and the event already ended, you get the rewards still. Everytime this happens on Xbox at an event, Queen fight, or Mischief I tell my friends to wait until it ends to close the game. You always get rewards to the event you are in.
---
The only thing that they made arguably good was NW. And I mean the mode at the beginning. It was actually polished and run well to almost everyone. And it's the only thing they marketed a week before launching it.
---
Everything else was hyped and good according to BGS, until we tested it.
---
It's pretty good but it has its issues. It was a completely broken mess on launch though. A lot of the hate and criticism the game gets now is from people who didn't play it or onlt played it at launch and watched a bunch of  videos on it. They basically aren't criticising the game anymore a lot of the times but a caricature of the game the internet created.
---
NV wasn't Bethesda btw.
---
They shouldn't be running cannibal on a huge event like this where people are dying left and right asking for revival...
---
who the hell is down voting? what a bunch of bethesda sympathizers. go play your broke ass game.
---
Why did you remove it? Change of heart? I feel bad for the people who put money towards this post just to have it removed.
---
Good on you, companies need to realise they should honour their products in good faith.
---
Will be 48 this coming December
---
Remove what? Nothing ever got removed lol.
---
Love the empty
---
It says it's removed. Maybe the mods did it. If they did, you can't tell unless you log off and view the post.
---
Good Lord it's only $14. Just buy it.
---
2nd attribute is 40% power attack damage iirc. I'm no fan of baseball bats but I believe a bloodied one would be quite good, I'm not a bloodied build. What exactly am I lying about?
---
Good job, mate! Is that the way to say it?
---
Anyway I got downvoted for pointing out the reason for the refund was a broken, buggy game, the only difference being we don't have that kind of consumer protection anymore in the US. 
---
Australia, Australia, Australia, we love you, Amen.
---
It's only a year old, it has a decent amount of content that has been released over the course of the last year. All games have bugs and crash, especially online games. The DLC isn't canceled its postponed.
---
you only HAVE to get close if you CHOSE to run melee only.
---
jump on the bus, double tap it, call it a day as everyone else gets tags and draws agro
---
yeah i know, it was good old OE.
---
I saw it and immediately knew they basically copy and pasted ESO's system.
---
The dude cannibalising you was funny
---
Nope - no reward
---
Yep. Mods removed it. Glad I know to log off in order to tell.
---
Because you can't fix a game that isn't making any money. They invested a 100 million dollars in creating the game, they lost money on release, and now they're trying to change the revenue model so that there's actual profit. That's all completely reasonable stuff for a business to do, and all of this outrage is ridiculous.
---
I didnt earn the quest rewards cuz I couldn't respawn....
---
I was being sarcastic. Cuz you were pointing out that this one post has 900 up boats. I can give you a whole list of post that prove my point as well. And rose-colored glasses? Means you're always looking at something optimistically, more specially for many on this sub, FO76.  Bethesda supporters will eat up anything fed to them and consider it the greatest thing since sliced bread but yet lose their minds when people complain about disconnects and blue screens during these new and shiny events Bethesda craps out.
---
Atom shop is a service. Services can change. The idea that they can never change is a bit nonsensical, no offense. You bought the game because of the actual game, not the products sold in the store. Has your gameplay changed at all after these items were added?
---
No idea honestly. I never pay attention to xp
---
And some people dont like the fact that there locked out of content some people just want the server dont want atoms some want a tiered service some dont want at all what is wrong with saying whats they think is wrong with it
---
I love the event.
---
I've had it fail once when I logged on, saw the event had been running for 11 minutes, turned up late and found the 15 idiots doing it had blown up all the cars in the wrong places.
---
I've had one blue screen.  Sad.
---
I reconnected to a world where some genius had nuked the event.  Sad again, but also funny.
---
Once I didn't get a hit on the legendary bot because overpowered dicks blew it away on 3 seconds,
---
But every other time has been perfect.  It's a blast.
---
They lied about paid content only being cosmetic.  Infinite scrap storage and a private lobby where you can farm every single workshop uncontested is a considerable mechanical advantage.
---
This is good that you finally got what you wanted. But I mean you went through all that to get your original purchase price back? It just wouldn't seem that serious to me I guess.
---
if you are on ps4 hit me up, we can run it together so you can get some sweet loot!  
---
If the subscription didnt give a mechanical advantage it would be fine. Its the fact that scrap storage and orivate lobbies are locked behind a paywall that is the issue.
---
&gt; by running back and forth getting candy over and over
---
Wait.  So the candy bowls refill?  I've never gotten candy out of one if I'm not the first person to the bowl.
---
Most likely PR bots!
---
Ah fuck.  So obvious, been battling supermutants for bones, I am such a dumbass.
---
I love the tent as well.  Definitely a very nice bonus to the membership.
---
That's okay, Pepperidge Farm remembers...
---
Good tip.
---
Well there’s a free pumpkin in the store that glows at least. Better than nothing
---
I have yet to have mine crash while playing the event. Thankfully. Tbf I've been lucky and don't seem to have anywhere near the amount of crashing issues it seems most have.
---
I've run into the "can't respawn" glitch once. I waited until the event was over (since I could see everything that was happening. Force quit the game, logged back in, and boom - all rewards were there in my inventory.
---
Did you force quit before the event was over?
---
Aww, I'm on PC (and a bit socially anxious besides), but it's quite kind of you to offer! Thank you so much, I truly appreciate it regardless. :)
---
For you it might be then we all value our money differently i could say this is a ripoff based soley on comparison to what other games offer for my 15 bucks
---
Bethesda has started making its way down a slippery slope. I for one don't like the idea of a real cash shop, period. In any of my games. But it is what it is. I can live with it. My main gripe is the price of things. Atoms shouldn't be this expensive. If you don't earn your atoms via challenges then it's essentially $5 for a skin, or $8 for a power armor skin. That price just seems so high to me considering in fallout 4, $5 bought you a LOT more. We're talking an entire DLC pack with 100s of new things. I think prices in the atomic shop should remain the same, but the atoms themselves should be cheaper. I'm thinking 300-500 per dollar instead of 100 per dollar. It would greatly incentivize people to purchase them more, and you still wouldn't be able to earn enough in-game to unlock everything.   
---
It's a win-win on everybody's part here.  The subscription fee is a bit much, though. Fallout 1st is double the price of PS PLus. It's a bit outrageous when you consider what you're getting for your money. Sure, if you look at it one way, if you're a player who purchases atoms regularly, then this will be an easy choice for you. You're basically getting discounted atoms PLUS all these other "perks" if you will.  From the perspective of someone who's willingly throwing their money away on atoms, this is an easy choice, you already get more than your money's worth in atoms. And that's the people they're targeting with Fallout 1st. That's what makes this shady to me. 
---
Are we paying for the atoms, or are we paying for the perks? Why do these two things have to be bundled together? It's basically a dirty sales tactic. This guaranteed they would get subs from those people who drop cash on this game every time the atom shop updates.  
---
At the end of the day, I don't really know what point I'm trying to get across here. I'm sorta just rambling. But the takeaway here is that people are too loose with their wallets, and Zenimax (or so I've heard) is taking advantage of that.  Gaming as a service! I miss my Super Nintendo.
---
A good one! Throw the x-02 skin from creation club in there!!!
---
I’m not following this logic.  You can earn atoms in game to buy stuff from the atom store.  You don’t have to spend money.  Calling someone an idiot because they also spend money on atoms, which keeps this game alive is sort of juvenile don’t you think?  It’s like people who sit around gaming the welfare system and talking crap about the taxpayers who work to fund their free stuff.  Don’t even start in the “I bought the game bs”.
---
And how did you obtain this mask?
---
Same here
---
I have when an atom shop purchase didn't work!
---
Where you going to log out for the final time? I suggest at vault 76- where it all began
---
Did you save any sentrybot for others or did you just unload on him and help kill him in 2 seconds? Either way just cause he ate you isnt the problem. Blame this broke game. Its pretty funny someone ate you besides you were just gonna get an ornamental vase and civil war hat.
---
Weren't you around few months after release when there was a huge hurr hurr we gonna sue Bethesda thing going on. 
---
There were lots of videos about some internet lawyers going over the TOS and class action suit this and that. It was a circus. 
---
Hell this sub is always a circus. Like now people spamming this Autralian thing that doesn't apply to most people here, and to those it does they probably have heard about it already.
---
I bet the old US class action things are going to get a second round inspired by this. Lots and lots of posts about Bethesda, and not about the damn game.
---
So in a few weeks we can say theres no new content then
---
Don't worry they fixed that by making them not actually private
---
By buying it for 15k
---
Nah I've gotten a couple jack o latern suits... just need the fireman helmet and thats it.
---
I just hope they lean into the factions of the fallout universe heavily. Like have dedicated raider factions, brotherhood, enclave, etc and give us the choice to pick and play as one. With each faction having unique quests and gear, and even pvp events against each other. I feel that’s what 76 should have been in the first place. Kind of a one off game where players get to be the factions. The lore is already so deep it wouldn’t have been difficult for them to rehash and they could have just treated 76 as fan service instead of its thrilling story of “everyone’s dead”. 
---
Doubt that’ll happen though haha
---
Awesome. Thanks for your interest in the pictures! :)
---
same here, it was chaos.  this post makes sense tho, thanks for sharing
---
You forgot that weapon and armor condition would also effect the item. 2 exact same combat rifles with slightly different condition are two different items too. 
---
That's going to add another sever thousand different items to the mix
---
I'll try it see if it works, hopefully it does be annoying to abandon a Plat run just because of a stupid bug
---
Not really. Exploiting a broken event is one of the most idiotic things someone can do.
---
Look another one who wants to be the very 1st by trying to shut down opinions with privileged expressions lluuuuul rofl
---
I agree with this. It's funny you brought up the meal thing because my wife and I were out to dinner and I heard a gentleman eat a good portion of his meal. Half, or a little more, before he realized he was given "the wrong meal." So it's pretty much the same thing. "Oh, after 25 hours of playtime, this really isn't for me."
---
Minutemen Skins!
---
Oh really? I actually didn't know that, my bad. I'll move mine then.
---
You wrote that wrong. Its called you 1st :D
---
Youre gonna regret this when wastelanders comes out and your broke and weaponless. At least leave yourself something cause you will be back.
---
That is besides the point of whether there is an actual legal obligation to fulfill promises regarding **not** selling items that you do not have to buy, and if you do not buy them, the game is not worse than it was before the items existed. A further complication is that the game is sold as a "service", the terms of which can change over time. It is possible that the pre-release marketing applies only to the launch version (where it really was cosmetics only), or the terms could change after a reasonable amount of time (like at least 1 year), or they could change anytime but recent purchases can be refunded in that case, I do not know the exact rules.

Bye Felicia

"Started with NV" - Good Taste my man
---
Well one could argue atomic shop purchases could be subject to that same refund if the base game it's dependent on doesn't function as advertised.
---
That's what i had in mind.
---
I do wonder if you preordered and how long you played until you realized you wanted a refund. If you preordered, I hope this experience was enough to make you not preorder in the future. And if you played for more than 2-3 hours, legally or not, I don't see why you would request a refund as it shouldn't take more than 2 hours to realize a game isn't up to your expectations.
---
Good luck and Godspeed...
---
Do you have gunsmith perk card on?
---
I'm not renewing PlayStation Plus
---
That's cool! I remember going to Bridge Day one time when I was younger and loving it! I have never spent any recreational time at Summersville, but I know a lot of people that have. 
---
I love your pics! I remember a while back you posting the pic in front of John Amos Power Plant! When I first saw the power plants in the original trailer for the game, I got so excited!
---
Difficulty?  It's a massive CF that lasts 2 minutes at most.  I wouldn't say it's difficult at all.  It's a blast and a chaotic mess, but difficult?  Hardly.
---
Does your helmet have an atom shop paint job on it? If so, I don’t think it can be displayed. Not 100% sure since I don’t use pa myself.
---
Respect 👍🏻
---
Wear the vault suit and the party hat
---
For real
---
I graduated from Marshall! Go Herd!
---
Why is everyone so god damn dramatic? If you're quitting then quit. We don't need a god damn soliloquy about why, because nobody really cares.
---
So you don't play and listened to some knuckle head who also doesn't play. 
---
You are a sheep.
---
I got the Sheepsquash Head Assultron Head weapon refunded, as it is a separate craft able weapon and not the skin that they implied!
---
Cool. 
---
Didn't realize they had initially said it already so long time ago. It was obvious you can't get server software for game like this, though.
---
No mechanical features should be behind a paywall.  Unlimited scrap storage should have been a feature from day one,  and private servers are better done by releasing server-side software so 3rd party hosts can exist.
---
Don't waste your time server-hopping. You can no longer find Scout Armor Masks from MODUS. They only drop from Savage Divide events now.
---
Nope. X0-1 with quantum paint
---
Thanks! I thought those were neat, too. There is actually a map of all the different Flatwoods Monster "chairs" around the area.
---
I love that you sacrifice your money to deliver some feedbag just to tell us that all the community most wanted features are actually good, but the price is horrible. Thats excactly why the majority is angry. That stuff should have been free from the very 1st second.
---
This is one of those times.
---
There's always pc :(
---
I agree for sure, it’s weird that they added things to synergise with bloodied but just neglected the other effects. Like junkies a simple perk that reduces the negative effects of addictions would be great! And yeah nocturnal definitely needs a boost! Mutants could even scale with the amount of mutations you have
---
Been looking too, rumor has it no longer spawns in the vendor but can drop from dailys, queen of the hunt being one. also, the colors of urban and forest seem to be fucked up after patch 14, at least in the view/inspect window. don't know if its alright when equipped?
---
I thought i was far from dramatic but thanks for your opinion simply leaving some people with some free loot.
---
Lol! What are they going hunt? What can they do to me? I have pacifist mode and I only do workshops in private servers anyway so I dont have to worry about pvp or any real griefing. I say just let them think they're helping a "noble" cause because at the end of the day its their own time wasted.
---
I think they only come from enclave events now. Pretty annoying they did that. Im Glad i grabbed them way back but dont have an extra. The forest one sucks though you cant wear it with other head pieces but the urban one you can.
---
I wish I could have lots of things for free, but alas life does not work that way.
---
Off topic:
---
Those who uninstalled &amp; don't play anymore. Why are you still here bashing Bethesda? Move on. Build yourself a bridge and get over it.
---
What point?
---
I simply said that the OP complained about getting downvotes on a post that's currently at 1332.
---
It seem to be the trend these days, like the guy posted "Guarentee this will be downvoted by Bethesda PR as well. Give it a few days and everyone will forget about fallout 1st and go back to praising Todd.", ended up at 9092.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/doirss/bethesda_pr_is_out_in_full_force_in_the_sub_again/
---
Victim culture all over the place.
---
Boss was just killed so fast there was not legendary just standard junk, everyone is way too sweaty at these events, most on crack probably or just drunk or young ?
---
This guy gets it!
---
76 was my first fallout game, and I have only just started getting into fallout 4. It’s a shame to see how great 76 could’ve been. If they took their time it would be a great game.
---
Yeah they are normal when equipped but viewing theyre all urban blue.
---
i get what youre saying but at the same time youre not posting something positive either. haha
---
Hmm... that's a good idea!  Would you lose the ability to use certain items if you decided to swap factions?  Maybe give you a bonus of some type for using items from within your faction, etc.
---
&gt;Buyer's remorse should not be a valid reason for a refund.
---
That's pretty ignorant. Buyer's Remorse is a perfectly valid reason for demanding a refund. Most states in the U.S. have Buyer's Remorse laws protecting consumers, granting the right to cancel contracts or return goods for any reason or no reason during a given number of days after purchase.
---
Hey Bethesda made their own choice who to partner with. At this point I do t think they do give a crap about their game, but how would I ever know the truth, it's not like they would say anything.  Would hines and company lie? Sure why not. I have no reason to trust, again they could say "hey I'm sorry..." But they won't so..
---
Idk how the jump ahead in time thing would work. Everyone would have to make new characters given that, you know, people can't live that long.
---
I can’t imagine anyone wearing anything that denotes them as a subscriber.  Harassment is real.
---
It's fine to like something but still be critical of its flaws. Due to the negativity bias, people focus on the bad thus they talk more about it. Those same people can still go and have a good time with the game they were just complaining about. This is the same with Modern Warfare, Destiny 2, and a few other games. Some shit sucks but some shits fun.
---
Well speaking as an adult, I dont give a flying "F" what people think about me or what I do. Everyone else should too. If i want to go into the atom shop and purchase everything, is anybody going to stop me? Nope I didnt think so. With that being said, I'll be on later and I'll purchase some atoms and I'll buy something and I want to see someone stop me. Let's see what rock one of those neckbeards will crawl out from under and try to stop me.
---
I hardly call 100 bucks a year a _micro_ transaction...
---
Queen of the Hunt is in the Mire, pretty sure you can't get Scout Armor Masks from that one.
---
I'm guessing rule 3 or 4 violation from the title, hard to say though since the body doesn't show in that.
---
Of course you can. No game company would have any way to know about who are their "new" customers.
---
Oh I don't know if I can support this hot take! I've busted into it shoveling snow...grilling...walking into the office...at a backyard fire...
---
It's addictive as hell.
---
thank the gods, was worried Id be looking like a freak when wearing them with mismatch parts
---
Yea I misread that lmao
---
Never seen it on PS4. When I do my dance emotes, people usually do them back at me. Are you trying to find some good stories to churn out some video content?
---
It's a game dude. It's not that serious. Turn it off for a bit and take a breather, do something else.
---
Idk gloating just seems petty and childish it’s like you want a cookie or something that’s why i downvoted it’s the same with the long annoying I’m leaving post spam that got posted here awhile back like just leave why do we need a life story it just seems childish
---
My guess is they're bored and try to have fun by shooting hoard of ennemies like flies...
---
Almost positive the recent problems everyone is having with crashes, lag, &amp; loading times are due to Fallout 1st....BGS dumbed down the free servers in order the boost server responsiveness for FO 1st renters to have a better experience. Just the first step before they try to force everyone into a sub for their shallow puddle of a game.
---
Again. Your not reading what I'm writing.
---
They DON'T have to work to hard to make fixes.
---
Releasing the Fallout1st before Test Servers.
---
I'm have no idea now you dont see how they're using those excuses to sucker you in.
---
Its great your a sympathizer 
---
But what is your objective by just pointing out one sided reasoning.
---
someone claimed he did some days ago in another scout post.
---
Dumbass, they don't happen because businesses put policies in that prevent them from happening in the first place because they know what will happen if they don't!
---
I'm sorry that your parents and school system failed to teach you common sense and critical thinking, but your delusional if you think insulting me actually counters anything I've said.
---
If you can't actually debate my arguments with a counter argument, you don't have an argument to begin with.
---
Seems they had a salty meal
---
I focused on a single point. That’s not simplistic; it’s specific.
---
Okay, so should a delay be good?  
---
Or is Wastelanders doomed to be bad because it's made by BGS?
---
Before getting the refund or before requesting it?  That seems an important distinction to me.  If people spend money on the game and apply for a refund early and then are *denied* the refund...or think they're unlikely to get it, it's totally reasonable for them to keep playing to (often futilely) try to get their money's worth out of the game.
---
Great job testing it before shipping it. Way to go. My god, how is this company still able to exist?
---
Why are you acting like some customer service representative?
---
I'm pretty sure if you have a responder outfit on and talk to it, it will give you a message.
---
If I'm thinking of the right bot.
---
Can I buy one?
---
Also, the fact that when trading for anything the prices were just arbitrary and you were always met with greed rather than having an actual functioning economy really pissed me off
---
Care if I add you? I'm sorry to hear about your bad experiences with 76.  It's only because of the small groups of people I play with that keeps me playing as well.  Best of luck in the future.
---
The second sub formed in direct response to a bandwagon circle jerk moving from Fallout to this subreddit, displacing their community. The people there, previously here, were attacked constantly just for playing the game. So it's only natural that the mods there would be removing posts that are only for the purpose of game bashing, circle jerking, trolling, etc
---
That definitely applies to people who apply for their refund after finishing their meal.  But if people apply for a refund once they realize the meal is terrible and *then* try to choke it down after their refund request is denied/ignored, that's different.
---
It was a very well-written and civil post.
---
I stopped playing this game almost a year ago. It is still having crash problems?? WTF
---
That's the point dummy.
---
You *played* the game, they didn't.
---
Hence the refund..
---
Yeah the mods here suck
---
Same, where you playing lol
---
Lol someone’s desperate. Gotta project your insecurities to feel better about your life? Pathetic.
---
people still play this game??
---
My comment won’t help directly, but may give a different perspective.  On levels 1 thru 50 take damage perks as often as possible.  Quality of life perks that allow you to carry more stimpaks and such are useless at killing enemies.  Use NukesandDragons to create your build, then stick to it.   It’s ok to put a point into Perception but take a card in Intelligence although the game doesn’t make it clear this is possible.  
---
By taking damage perks, even non-legendary weapons will kill enemies across the map.  I suspect it’s your build that is holding you back. 
---
This is just a guess based on my experience with helping people understand the game.
---
Your problem is assuming everyone here wants to make the community a better place... most of them are here to troll...
---
I'll have you know I bought that fridge for the express purpose of making a kitchen. I literally never use it since I only use canned food.
---
YES THANK YOU SWEET BABY JESUS
---
Acquiring caps isn’t “winning”. P2W implies there is some way to definitively win the game. Which there isn’t. 
---
I completely respect your opinion and understand your frustration, but it’s getting extremely irritating seeing people misconstruing exactly what is being offered with this service. 
---
PvP is entirely optional. There isn’t a leaderboard that tracks kills or caps acquired or who clears a dungeon fastest. There isn’t a single “competitive” aspect of this game. Someone having extra stash space in no way effects your experience.
---
Hahahaha
---
Maybe you could pay a hundred caps or something to get rid of a disease.
---
Ugh just so you know more people bought than even Bethesda's expected. Nobody posts about it though because of the hate its recieved.
---
&gt;Good job cheating the system.
---
If you did a modicum of research into this you'd see those that got a refund won't be able to play any longer.
---
Idiot.
---
No. They promised most of that stuff before launch. Not buying it period. Give us what u promised first than u consider giving a sub with differen and newer shit and for no more than $5 $6 at most a month and like a 50 dollar a year. And take away and pay advantage things as well.  another promise they broke. It's a shame cuz I did enjoy the game. But the crashs and the loot drops were pushing my buttons and than they came out with the pay advantage things in the the shop and I just couldn't do it anymore. U do all that I would easily come back and play and buy that 50 sub as well.  
---
Theres just to many games coming out that are gonna be SOOOOO much better. Cyberpunk, Death Stranding, Modern Warfare (Best COD Since MW3), FF7 Remake, The Last of Us 2. Y give a game  That clearly doesn't really care about its fans considering all the promises that they broke. Then try to charge you for most of the stuff that they promised for free. MW is all free no loot boxes either. Sorry for the rant . I've been a huge Fallout since Vegas. Sorry but to me is almost a slap in the face from them throughout all of 76 especially when u paid 60 for it and it wasnt even close to finished.
---
Used to be a cannibal. Can confirm that the button to rez someone and to eat them are the same. Once went to revive someone awhile back, ended up eating them instead, they died immediately. I felt so bad 😂
---
lol you think it's v few people. It's been pretty good so far, the dance emotes are fun, I don't really wear the NCR ranger outfit. It's worth more than the atom bundle I bought once, good atom value
---
You do when someone takes your bag. Happened to me last night but it wasn’t anything to fret over
---
I've countered your arguments and acknowledge the logic behind it.  I explained that your logic had no real world application or practical value.  So I've heard you well and explained why I have a different PoV and you've failed to make any point that shows how your ideas are valid.  Since there is no practical application of your logic and you're failing to demonstrate a good reason for holding them how is it reasonable to expect to change my mind.  Now youre pissed because I disagree with you.
---
Yeah I'm not the problem here.
---
Poor analogy. Meals don't get changed drastically after you order them/while you're eating them. 
---
If you play for over 20 hours and the developers release updates which massively change the game in ways you don't like/enjoy, you should still be entitled to a refund, because the game is essentially no longer what you paid for.
---
You mean how they actually lock all the best stuff behind said $15? Are you saying that's what they should do with Fallout 76? Make the subscription a requirement for the DLC, or buy the DLC separately?
---
I changed my fo4 menu theme to that and im happy abt it
---
Yay
---
100%, loving every second of it. Thanks for the passive aggressive post 👍🏻
---
Me too!
---
Yes. The scrap box is very useful
---
I disagree. If you expect a refund, then don't play the game. If you play the game, don't expect a refund. It doesn't matter why you play. Spending 30 hours on a game is getting the value from it, whether you claim to be having fun or not. You can't have it both ways.
---
Eh, all they've really introduced are the repair kits (better ones can be earned in game), and the scrap kits. I do think the Collectron and fridge should have had free basic versions attached to quests, with skins in shop. That part I was a little surprised at.
---
The infinite scrap and private instance really aren't that considerable of anything, except a convenience. Calling it an advantage in a game where most people want nothing to do with PvP is a bit of a stretch.
---
As long as they have gloves.
---
You don't drop a bag in public events anymore.
---
That sure was a bummer.
---
FO76 is trash, and time and again, has proved to just be a cash crab in bethesda's eyes and nothing more. There should be no payed subscriptions in a game that u already spend 60$ to play, there should be no content locked behind a pay wall. The people who bought fallout 1st deserve to be kicked out of the community because clearly they are on the wrong side of the issue.
---
May you find more fun for your money on your journey. 2x Full price buyer here, only reason I play is for my wife, she loves running her store and I find her good gear to sell, together we've made millions, own all plans, and have 8 mules of God tier gear....my work is surely finished on 76, but she doesn't like playing without me. Bounce between TOW and 76 for her.
---
You do and I did
---
Its amazing. I can finally finally get out of my wwr set and put on some sentinel. Also the Halloween event is so much better. Its not even about the lag. I dont have to worry about missing any of the legendaries. Sometimes its nice to unwind with my group and farm script.
---
The rest of the budget was spent adding "Ring of Fire"
---
Berserkers works best with Nocturnal.  Wear Nocturnal Wood or trapper armor, during the day use your berserkers weapon, as the negative armor from nocturnal increases your berserkers damage, then at night swap to nocturnal weapon to make use of the damage and armor buff from it.  Its a fun build I have on one of my characters but compared to others not properly viable. 
---
A damage buff would make it more viable or add a serendipity type dodge to Berserkers.  The lower your damage resistance the higher the % to dodge incoming damage up to 20% at 0 DR, to make up for the loss in DR.
---
Nicely said! Thankfully FO1st has no bearing on the ability to hear. If it did; it would be worth it. Seeing as my last "ears" cost a fortune
---
&gt; the atoms you get from it are more than worth it.
---
If you care about atoms I guess? But a lot of the features of Fallout 1st should have been added free at release. And if not at launch, should not have been added behind a paywall. Like Bethesda themselves stated they would not do.
---
It's like when they offered 500 atoms for lying about the bags. Instead of refunding and allowing the players the choice between their money or atoms. They lie and expect the players to just take it.
---
That is server lag, if you wait it will proc for you.
---
Not disagreeing with you but your last line is so beautifully surreal.
---
Good suggestion. I've thought about joining someones private server but Im not sure how they would think about that, as they are just completely strangers to me I've just traded with, so I've not.
---
25 hours of playtime isnt equivalent to half of the game though.
---
It's way more than just a few. Love it and yes, worth every penny!
---
Yes you can still find the outfits as well as the plans for them. If you're on ps4 I could give you a set of both
---
From the event? Yes, you can find both.
---
It's a broken event that only pops up every hour. I work 8 hours a day unlike your home schooled ass.
---
Ok, not sure if it's a glitch atm but you can take any scout armor, mask included, and change the paint from urban to forest and back. In a armor workbench.
---
At the moment this is done entirely in good faith, unfortunately you get companies like Bethesda and Activision that introduce microtransactions and other revenue streams like subs post release, generally not too much longer after reviews have gone around.
---
I think it will be something that will eventually have better laws covering it, as with most things that rely on good faith.
---
So it seems you're just going to fall back on someone else literature to uphold your argument.... huh. Well not to worry, as this statement still doesn't hold water. 
---
&gt;Any post-launch updates to any game launched in Australia, could technically be grounds for a refund, because you are altering the original goods purchased.
---
&gt;If video game companies were to all adhere specifically and only to the Australian consumer protection laws, we would see a LOT less people updating their game after launch. You would get full games at release, that would never be touched again except to add paid DLC. Free updates that touch any content the game already has added, are gone, because they might alter the original product.
---
So your point is that this will lead to people asking for refunds because their game had content added to it? Do you actually think that the majority of the population of gamers would do that? Because it seems more to me like individuals were wanting refunds because of what content was added (mainly microtransactions) and what content wasn't (anything actually worthwhile). BGS swindled its customers. First with the preorder merchandise, second by failing to adhere to their own plans for the game, and third with the microtransactions and subscription. That's why people want a refund, and the fact that they ARE getting a refund goes to show they're justified. These kind of braindead, half-cocked arguments are truly my favorite.
---
I was going to say the same thing.  Typically it’s ghouls that immediately teleport back to spawn. After your 15th run around the Whitespring, you’ll have every ghoul memorized. By the 1500th time, they’re usually easier to find at the spawn instead of random body parts scattered all over a smoking parking lot.
---
Guess I have bad luck then! Thank you!
---
[Got 'em] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uOMCfopR8).
---
Thank God I saw your post. I was going nuts wondering why it was the only plan I was missing from the event. Maybe next year.
---
1. I am aware of earned Atoms (they have recently taken away some of them which is its own controversy)
---
2. Have no issues with post launch monetization / subscription services when its not pay to win and / or taking away from the base game. Scrap bot, fridge, Scrap box, and soon more "feedback" driven "utility items are P2W.
---
3. I'd like to see more quest based rewords that way there is actually something to do when I get a new item. Players need more things to do if you want them to keep playing.
---
4. I did pay for the game and have bought atoms for cosmetic items so I am one of these "tax payers".
---
5. Rather than fixing / adding in free content post launch (like they said they would) it gets delayed, is seasonal, or offers little to no fun factor / rewords.
---
6. Now they are trying to sell me a private server that has less lag, free of any competition from other players, and a scrap box that stores infinite scrap (which they claimed was impossible but not when there is money to be had).
---
The problem with Bethesda's post launch monetization is that it isn't being done in a way that benefits the game. They actively lie about there products too. Its no wonder there are so many people being loud and calling foul with this.
---
3 and New Vegas don't feel like 1 and 2, 4 doesn't feel like any and 76 feels different too. Many original fans stopped playing at Fallout 3 and never came back. 
---
So ... There are levels of tolerance, I guess.
---
What about the fact they can go to every power armor station on the map and collect pieces to build sets at no cost then undercut the competition?
---
Really? Ive wasted so much time acquiring forest and urban sets. In the leaks thought there was a scout paint. So that should be coming in the future though i wasnt a fan of it.
---
They're a pretty common reward from Mischief Night. Alternatively there are places where they always spawn so you can just go get them both without having to rely on luck. And if you're on PC I can just craft them both for you.
---
Oh really! Yeah I'm on pc that would be awesome!
---
According to BDG they just need a 4th era of ska
---
I’ve never objected to a cost for private worlds, nor have I advocated for a totally unlimited stash.  As I stated earlier, I have no issue with a subscription service. My only objection is QoL improvements being paywalled.
---
If unlimited scrap is possible—and they know people are going to go absolutely bananas with it, so it must be—it should be available to everyone.
---
The servers are AWS servers. The hardware is not an issue. Software and optimization deployed by Bethesda might be, but players who subscribe aren’t getting better servers or even separate servers. It’s all virtual.
---
My name is Codydabeast87 on there!
---
That’s a good looking evolution for your build.  Should be fun!   You can always swap in the carry weight perks for fast traveling if needed.  And I don’t think you’ll miss class freak...playing without it becomes normal pretty quick.
---
If people stop making money they usually look at why, and adjust their tactics.
---
If they introduced microtransactions 3 months after release and people wanted refunds, maybe they’d avoid that, or even try being totally transparent about it before release so people don’t feel cheated.
---
A loyal consumer will fully support a company and product they feel they’ve gotten good value from, this extends into future purchases.
---
Very well. My IGN is Pryce\_Permafrost.
---
Same... but since no one can see what’s in it technically we’re guilty in some eyes... I’m like ... whatever, it’s my game...
---
They drop from savage divide events from what I've heard. I got mine from uranium fever
---
Truth, every single word.
---
Thanks man I’ve been having a blast on The Outer Worlds. 
---
That’s awesome though I’m glad you guys are enjoying it, sadly nobody I played with ever logs on anymore. I bought the Game twice as well (PS4 and PC) was also gifted the Power Armor edition by my girlfriend and the Pip-boy edition by my best friend. I’ve given away two copies of the game to try and get people to play lmao.
---
I can craft them if you need one for the event :)
---
Ita been great i think its worth it. I bought atom shop wall paper that 8 always wanted and have been letting randoms join my server as long as they leave the ammo depo alone
---
I suspect that with the amount of instability we already currently have we shouldn't even ask for them to attempt to do this.
---
Why not judge players buying into it? They are enabling the behavior.
---
I only crash when I die... 3 out of 4 times now. On PS4 too
---
Problem is there is a lot of hackers on Pc. Especially NW. would be chaos and would probably drove people away.  Cross play on consoles sure. But with PC I’d would need a lot of work to fix all the exploits hackers use
---
Anymore? It has been my primary complaint form the very beginning.
---
People seem to forget that NV was unplayable for about two weeks after launch before they finally patched it. They also seem to forget that you have to deal with corrupted saves and hung load screens even to this day.
---
It’s a great game, I personally replayed it just before 76 came out, but it’s still buggy as hell even after the modding community did their best to fix it.
---
I tried that event 5 times on ps4 ...it crashed three times ...and last night I completed the event and didn't get ANYTHING as a reward ...now that was fun 😭😭😭
---
Sent you a request. I'll go craft them now.
---
A lot of my friends thar bought it dont really care enough to voice there opinion or have reddit
---
I appreciate it but someone else said they could. Thank you though!
---
&gt;And Players don’t have to pay to fix it as the purchases are voluntary
---
We're discussing Bethesda, and the fact that the reason they're short on money is because they shipped a garbage game and abused players trust on multiple occasions. 
---
Then have the audacity to ask players to pay for what they stated would be free at launch. And your argument is, because it failed so bad, it's valid that they now charge for what they promised in the beginning. When they've already charged for that. (The $60 purchase price)
---
That's shitty. They're shitty. Paying for it encourages them to continue to be shitty.
---
Id at least give myself a cushion. Weve all swore were done with a game and maybe in a year you want to try again. Im at least going to let wastelanders come out to confirm this games done or maybe its has a shot. Im not optimistic as this event is the same BS as the others. Lame RNG and crashes on top of crashes.
---
No details regarding why you wanted a refund, or what happened. Gilded, thousands of upvotes. _All aboard the Bethesda hate train, no questions asked_
---
When it went on sale for Black Friday last year, I had kept my receipt from my original full-price purchase at EB (Canadian Gamestop). Since EB doesn't have any sort of price protection or guarantee or anything (because they're a shitty, scumbag company) They wouldn't refund me the difference, which was about 45 bucks. My solution was to purchase a new copy at the discounted price, put the discounted receipt in my pocket and pull out the full price receipt, and return the game I had just bought 30 seconds before with the full price receipt. No serial numbers on games, so all the see is a sealed game and a receipt. Fuck EB.
---
Yeah true
---
Anytime :)
---
Shit at this point i wish i was in Australia as i for sure want a refund after they lied about giving us private server. It was all a lie just like the cake was.
---
I agree, they fucked themselves in the long run. Now shit had 2 be good because they have no excuse
---
Im on PC but thank you!
---
Pro Tip:  Stop posting garbage and they will stop banning you.
---
Zzzzz zzzzzz zzz yap yap yap...
---
You care too much dude.
---
Is it annoying that the event is glitchy? Yeah.
---
Does that justify you being obnoxious? No, but I'm sure you think it does.
---
Well this is a mean-spirited post that shuts down any communication on the topic.
---
👎👎
---
You probably know this, but to get them you have to wear a costume or you will end up with lower tier rewards only.
---
Then don’t buy anything from them as I said before it’s your choice. Me I’ll continue to support the game I enjoy playing.
---
You want the mask and hat too or just the costumes?
---
Hats would be awesome
---
Private servers allow you to expierence FO76 the way it was supposed to be.  Ever done an Uranium Fever with maybe half a dozen mole miners the whole time? Not on private, all the spawns show up for the party! Very little to no lag, world loot is just chillin waiting for you to pick it up. Scrapbox means my stash(es) are all in good order, and I get atoms to spend( meh, we need better Atom shop items) From my obsessive point of view, very worth the dough.
---
I’ve never advocated for an unlimited stash box. Just scrap, which, contrary to their earlier statements, is actually entirely possible after all. 
---
“Pay for convenience” is just paying to solve an artificial problem the developers designed into the game so they could sell you a solution. If you’re ok with being played like that, that’s on you.
---
Actually it does and stating it's happening while presenting no evidence is poor reasoning. You seem to have an emotional need to defend fo76 while I try to be objective and use critical thinking skills. To posit that there are no ongoing and chronic bugs associated with this game and simply respond with "there are no problems here" is foolish
---
I’m not renewing PlayStation plus so if I do give it another chance it will be on pc. Still uninstalling it though.
---
I mean, if you’re averaging 100 points of XP per match, and I’m making that easily while afking, you seriously just bad, I have a hard time believing that you’re never getting any kills even if that means that you are just one tapping them. I’m mostly just stating that you literally have to be trying to get less than 130 per match and even then it’s incredibly hard. If you seriously are that bad, just do what everyone else who somehow makes a worse score trying to play then my amazing macro that stands still does, and that is to just sit around in bushes with a hazmat suit hoping to get that placement XP. I can agree with you that damage done should be worth some XP, however a more accurate estimate if you tried to hide or optimize your build would be around 200-300 for a bad match.
---
Is this even rewarding all the whiteprings vendor plans or just certain ones? I got the gilded clock plan and a bunch of resort lamps plans.
---
Whats crazy is that Bethesda could do both!  Make money and appease the Fallout fans. The real problem is not listening to the customers.  They take one part of a conversation and run with it and twist it to fit their agenda.
---
Jesus. I'll just stop you right there before somebody gets the wrong idea and thinks the place you are moving the goalposts is where they've always been. 
---
Pay to Win doesn't just apply to scenarios in which paying makes you literally enter a win-state.
---
Highly doubt you’ll get banned bro. It’s a bug that’s been around for months. Usually happens when there’s a lot of lag and you are using a higher clip capacity gun then switch to a lower capacity. 
---
So let’s say you using a Quad Tesla then switch to a pump. The pump might have 80 shells in chamber due to lag.
---
If you go to crevasse damn you spawn right next to a random encounter that will sometimes be a dead trick or treaters. They should have the plans for one of the outfits. Sometimes it'll have the plans for the hat and the outfit and other times it'll just be 1 of them. The plans will also be for the costume the dead trick or treater is wearing. Hope this helps you get a set for yourself
---
That's because it *IS* a Halloween costume
---
I sea what you did there ; }
---
Uninstall the game. They only look at the amount of devices downloaded not currently playing. Play some outer worlds, its a good game.
---
Honestly i home my $100 helps oit to develop the hame more. If they release expansion packs like ESO where we can go to other places in america like the pit or capital wasteland ill gladly buy it
---
Yeah but FF14 is a massive gigantic MMORPG. Fallout 76 is a sub par low on content multiplayer survival game with a fallout skin.
---
The Mayor of Fallout has spoken.  You heard em firsters, get the fuck out of here, you've been canceled by some anon.  Thats it for you.  Out.
---
Ah ok thanks, I'm primarily a heavy weapon user but switched to shotguns cause I've been out of bullets.
---
Sorry but I can't hear you. I see you're trying to use your microphone. I added some other costumes for good measure.
---
I really enjoy all my friends having it. I just give them all of my junk. Farming legendaries are really nice too. I also like transferring all my Legendaries to other characters via train station suit cases without worrying that the game is gonna crash or someone is gonna steal them.
---
You are every company's wet dream.
---
lol yeah don’t worry fam you good. Unless you running mods to have more ammo you won’t have a issue :)
---
I could ask the same thing of you, regarding the one sided reasoning. I'm doing my best to be objective, and not just let my emotions and personal feelings get in the way of my judgement. Everyone wants free stuff, as illustrated by this feigned outrage everyone is expressing. 
---
I AM reading what you're writing. I'm just not agreeing with you. There's a difference.
---
They do have to work hard to make fixes. They have to try to recreate the bug, comb through lines of decade old code to try and determine which one caused the error. They have to pay people to do this. They have to pay then t ok make the fix. They have to pay Sony for the use of their servers, because Sony hosts the game. They have to pay LadyDevann and others to be on here monitoring Reddit's reaction (which is far from a majority of the player base, we are just the most vocal). They have to pay the people on customer service, the ones who pass the bug reports on to the dev team. Etc etc etc
---
There is nothing easy or cheap about this. You just don't understand what all goes into the games we play.
---
Except your "truth" isn't true whatsoever and is only your own ignorant viewpoint. Also of course people refunding their games hurts BGS?? That's literally them losing money how would that NOT hurt them??
---
Lol. It was not and still is not even after the editing of what op originally said
---
I like this idea, although I think it should be rank 5 and cost one of your explosives
---
Yes to all
---
No it’s not. Lmao
---
Yeah echochambers are fun and healthy 🙄
---
That's the problem. We wouldn't know until it's delivered.
---
However the argument they did this or that so it would be good is not okay.
---
😂 Oh, like Outer Worlds? There was a whole lot of hype for a game that ended up having MAYBE 30 hours of gameplay, all of it linear and story driven.
---
I've gotten the gilded clock and the WS sign, no lamps yet.
---
Yeah i say if your a fallout fan get it for cheap. If not a big fallout fan wait for npcs to get the game
---
Except that doesn't work here.
---
You say very few but it seems like everyone in the mischief night event is doing the mothman dance after
---
GG, I only have one more quest to do and.the plat is mine.
---
Very few people? I’m not sure which public servers you’ve been on lately, but just about every camp I’ve visited has the scrap box.
---
It seems a bit sporadic what counts and what doesn't. I got credit for the cars in the maintenance building lot for both the first and second sections, but not every time. Sometimes I was getting credit for objectives not listed, like for killing bots when that wasn't on the list.
---
The best method IMO is just repeatedly taking from the candy bowls (except the first section of course). If you sneak you don't even have to fight the bots.
---
At no point did I say the goalposts were moving. 
---
Literally every game that’s come out of Korea has something similar to fallout 1st. Most mmorpgs do too. 
---
They all over some sort of cash payment that increases carry weight, inventory space, increased xp, etc. You know, **real** P2W mechanics. 
---
Giving you some extra stash space in a game in which another player has **zero** impact on your gameplay experience isn’t even in the same area code as P2W. 
---
You can climb down off your high horse now. Just because you’ve lived under a rock and this is the 1st time you’ve heard of something like this doesn’t mean the goalposts are moving.
---
I like it. It's brisk, plenty of action, and the game freezes and/or crashes less than half the time.
---
Yeah it's about as fresh as India's current air quality lmao
---
I think that's a new bug.
---
I have pacifist on and recently I did Awol event with 2-3 other players. They were a bit low level(like 20-70), I was playing with my melee char so I only tagged the enemies and wanted to avoid charging the masses of robots with my melee as then I could die and possibly risk my loot getting stolen. There were few deaths, one time nearly all died, I just let them repawn normally, I didn't want to get in there with all robots, since it's not public event.
---
Then the last two robots were both 3 stars, with their usual explosions. Though they didn't come together, first one, then second. The first one killed some level 50, but he was resurrected by someone else, and the second 3* boss, after it's death, killed one level 26 who apparently haven't learned from example to avoid the exlosion, so I went to resurrect him as the other players were already leaving.
---
And I saw the second prompt besides stimpak. My melee char is the only one with cannibal, I think the prompt was specifically execute. I even got some atoms from it, because the daily mission had just changed and that kind of task was one. Now I don't often resurrect other players, I do it plenty of time since I'm never short of stims, but most of the time Im doing public events or just soloing, it's always better to play events solo because then there's no potential asshole to bait you to die, or to one shot enemies.
---
And also while I play with my melee char plenty, I play my main char, and my other bloodied rifle build more. But the thing is I'm fairly sure I haven't previously seen that second prompt. I'm not supposed to see that since Im not supposed to be able to harm anyone. I even double checked that I really do have pacifist on with that char too, since if long time ago I've taken a workshop and turned it off, without remembering to turn it back on.
---
My team, as little as 1 other( bloodied for damage) and I kill her regularly. I take all 3 pylons. The above advice is right on, just wanted to add, cola nut and nuka colas make you nearly invincible.
---
Except those supporting fallout 1st are ruining games for everyone else. So yeah there is a need to direct hate.
---
But it is...Why do you think Sony delays games?  
---
Just to make people mad, or to make sure it's good?
---
I still like FO76, but it is true that Zenimax is awful. I couldn't get ESO to update for years and they kept making easily disprovable arguments about how it was someone else's fault. Not good guys.
---
Fuck I wish that were the case in America
---
The sidewalks around the center garden have boxes set out around the semi circular ends that are full of forks. You just click the box and it does it for you. If the boxes are gone someone did it already. If they're there just click them and it might take a little while because of lag.
---
You can like the game. Enjoy what you enjoy. 
---
But not allowing Bethesda to take responsibility for their failures and falsehoods will ultimately make the game worse in the long run.
---
I never said there were no problems, just that they are working on the problems. You seem to think that you're a fucking know-it-all and want to state that I have an "emotional need" to defend a game when I don't. I am not defending 76 because it contributes to my emotinal health, I'm defending it cause I want to. Being objective would be understanding that bethesda isnt sitting on their hands doing fuck-all.
---
It does while i struggle to maintain stash space someone else has unlimited because they paid extra for it. 
---
Im sorry man but your being naive. I really hope you can find enjoyment in the game. They killed it for me im done.
---
How? I haven’t bought an EA game in 10 years or more, I don’t commonly buy into MTX, this is the one I found real value in and I’m ruining gaming? I’m utterly confounded.
---
So we toss rocks through the Slocum's Joe windows?
---
Upvoted because it made me chuckle.
---
I haven't payed for Fallout First because I don't see a need to have a unlimited stashbox thing. If I did,  I'd be buying it for the 1650 atoms a month and the ranger outfit.
---
Dude, they can't even fix they crashing, what makes you think they can even do 1 of those things?
---
You don't need a shit load of supplies.
---
They’ll definitely be more in-depth, each having their own stories instead of “Let’s trade some things.” every time.
---
Saw a guy flexing on people by making a wall of scrap boxes at white spring
---
If you respawn after the event has ended, then you drop your junk anyway.
---
I don't know about event rewards though. They might be applied anyway.
---
&gt; Anyone downvoting care to explain what is so bad about my rights being upheld in the face of Bethesda refusing to do the right thing until forced by a government body? 
---
Shill accounts, gormless fanboys, and people who sunk money and time into it already and refuse to see the truth.
---
You on pc?
---
If you participate in the US economy as a consumer you've already been in submission so long you've got stockholm syndrome.
---
Um you do but ok...
---
i am a human
---
fridge and scrap were the beginning of the end imo, repair kits were the justification the scrap and fridge were the profit
---
Giving everything up after dumping several hundreds of hours into a game is no joke.
---
Lol!!! I didn't even realize that. That's frustrating. I'm going to leave it there so everyone knows I'm a fuckung rotard.
---
Thank you for doing the right thing. Much appreciated.
---
I know that I changed my ubran mask to look forest, same with my Bol/sent/RR USA left leg. Name stays it's just a paint skin swap.
---
Dang, if you could wait till tomorrow I'd gladly take some free stuff on ps4.
---
I was just planning to come back after 6+ months of not playing
---
Lmao. That’s hilarious. Why does this bother you?
---
Lmao that’s hilarious. Why does this bother you?
---
Error unknown input
---
my username is my psn, add me
---
Yes.
---
Why cares? You don’t lose anything.
---
I agree considering the game dropped in price a week later
---
why do you even care tbh? Jealousy?
---
Well I up voted his and downvoted yours cause you're a twat.
---
This is just fine. So long as the news gets out there.
---
Thanks for caring mods :)
---
Yes, but the event ended when he was in respawn timer.
---
If you respawn while the event is on, you don't choose respawn point or to respawn at all.
---
This happens if you are in respawn timer phase when the event ends. You might not be able to respawn. I have managed to, but many others seem not, it might depend on event or possible how far you are from closest fast travel point to respawn into.
---
We used to have EB as well here in the US but GS bought them and rebranded them. I remember way back when it was Electronics Boutique!
---
I get that they are what you want and at the end you are having fun with your friends. I'm just laughing at the bare minimum effort Bethesda did to implement the system and then charge 100$ for it. After a full year of development. I was actually expecting private severs with custom mods after 1 year not just a toggle off players setting.
---
&gt; It’s called logical reasoning and doesn’t need examples to work.
---
So Philosophy.
---
This is an odd place for Philosophy. 
---
You might want to stick to talking about real world examples here.
---

---
If your doing PVE, your agility and luck need to look more like that. The rest is flexible but if you really want to max your damage those agility and luck perks are more important than pretty much anything else.
---
You need to use sneak with rifles, you will only be plinking for like 3-400 damage per shot without sneak crits and the right perks.
---
Demo expert is useless unless you have a ton of points left over, you won't with rifles if your build is right. Its only like a 12% increase in total damage I believe.
---
 Adrenaline and gun-fu give you a huge damage boost, with the sneak attack bonus from covert operative, handmades will be hitting in the thousands each shot. You can push this even higher with vats crits. Better criticals perk makes your crits do more damage, and grim reapers sprint keeps you in action points for a long time. 
---
Agility determines your sneak effectiveness, and unless your doing pvp theres no need for dodgy or serendipity because nothing should detect you with a full set of unyielding. The 35+ perception makes you extremely accurate in vats as well.
---
In endurance I run radicool and fireproof on all my builds. It makes you invincible to scorch beast sonic attacks unless you just stand there for like 20 minutes. Rejuvenated only adds like 9 hit points I think? When I tested it at 20% health it was basically nothing and not worth it at all.
---
Put a suppressor on your guns, crouch and sneak attack everything. Otherwise you're damage will be meh and the low health thing will be pointless. A junkies sneak crit build could out dps the build you have, as sneak is necessary to hang with the big dogs damage wise.
---
See my reply from above, for specifics.
---
Again your literally talking like I'm actually saying that making a game is easy??
---
If anything your speculating could be maybe possible if the situation and reailty actually fit....
---
AGAIN I said they make it clear they are looking whale hunt by releasing fallout 1st in response to outer worlds being released. I really cant understand how you dont think the ranger outfit being giving in the first entitlements isnt a CLEAR jab at other game makers like a child...
---
They CHOOSE to monetize people INSTEAD of starting the test servers to maybe test shit like this so release arent a PR disaster
---
Please understand no one asked for you to respond to let everyone know you opinion. Your clearly not looking for a explanation to why I have my opinion, like I asked of yours. Soo.... you really could just stop trying to argue for the sake of arguing
---
Wow that sucks but okay at least now I know!
---
Not that you should upgrade your system for this game's sake, but if you have the cash get an external USB SSD and install the game on it if you haven't already. I have two xbox's and the one running an SSD doesn't crash nearly as often (not just this game, but also NV, fallout 4 and skyrim run way better on it).
---
No... you don’t. Not while event was going on at least.
---
Might be file size. Lot of npc coding and replacing empty towns enemy spawn points
---
I care, I love that you used the word soliloquy, but no point in being rude about it. He's giving shit to other people on his way out...
---
&gt; Anyone unsatisfied with and having played it for no more than X hours should be able to get a refund. Anyone having played it more than X hours shouldn't be able to get a refund.
---
So the laggier the developer makes it, with the longest possible cutscenes right away, the less chance we have to refund?
---
Terrible idea.
---
You don’t need to respawn to earn them. You just done get the notification. Check your inventory.
---
Holy shit, someone actually made a compelling argument and did it without calling people boot lickers or making any derogatory statements. It can be done. Have a silver for actually thinking and articulating without insulting like a child.
---
&gt;Perhaps, many years from now, the game will be released in this way as a last ditch effort to make back the immense financial losses
---
Immense financial losses huh 🤔
---
I don't recall them ever mentioning how much the game has made one way or the other.
---
Theres this from near launch
---
&gt;The NPD Group's report for US game sales in November show that Fallout 76 was the fourth best-selling game of November, only behind Battlefield V, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and Red Dead Redemption 2. While the NPD Group's reports now contain digital sales numbers, this only applies to some publishers. Bethesda doesn't share digital game sales, so Fallout 76 ranking fourth with only physical sales accounted for is a more impressive achievement.
---
&gt;Fallout 76's physical sales in the US in November amounted to the third highest launch-month sales in the history of the Fallout series, only behind Fallout 4 and Fallout: New Vegas.
---
Source https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-first-month-sales-heres-how-the-game-d/1100-6464002/
---
So at least it started good before the reviews and general hate. No one except BGS and Zenimax knows for sure how much the game has made.
---
I paid full price based on the series. Beth didn't deliver.
---
The problem with music is that the enemies are more hyper alert over it so sneaking is next to impossible
---
P2W is ANY system that gives clear advantages in the game over other by paying real world money. You can try to defend it all you want but in the end you are arguing for the degradation of the game. You can't deny the small "advantages" gained by spending real money are adding up and ramping up.
---
Not sure i care about what someone who imparts his own bias onto others has to say.
---
No. Doesn’t bother me, but it is bold to flaunt your exploited gear
---
tell that to the ACCC lol, get fucked zenimax
---
classy move, my friend.
---
hope you find one you are looking for!
---
Depends on your local consumer laws &amp; body. Might be an idea to write to them &amp; sites the ACCC ruling.
---
Good luck.
---
Whatcha want lol
---
Then it must have been magic because it happened, event was still going on but you know best, I guess
---
What'cha want lol
---
They broke their promise of free features and cosmetic only dlc, stop shilling
---
Biggest DLC ever doesnt necessarilly refer to map size.  It is more likely file size. 
---
There is alot of new content being added to the existsing map.  Repopulation of WV, NPC coding, Questlines, Dialog selections, ect.
---
They may keep the same map and just have a boatload of content to add to it (this is very feasible with how empty the world is)
---
I think the player's vendor didn't finish it's update. It takes a few moments and or the player left in the middle of the transaction
---
Probably not. Maybe a few underground locations but when they say biggest they probably mean amount of new or changed content. (NPCs, dialogue, buildings, etc)
---
Good. Fuck them
---
Used to happen to me a long time ago, too bad it only happened to my syringer, which has a firing rate equal to its reload speed.
---
Yeah I'm really enjoying the halloween event too. I think I like this one better than fastnacht and meat week. It's more exciting and the rewards are better (IMO) and easier to get all of them.
---
This so much makes me want to be a cannibal now....I never knew
---
Them not wanting to dig out refunds is provably one if the reasons why Fallput 76 isn't on steam. I doubt Bethesda would have made as much money if everyone was able to get a steam refund lol
---
As did I friend, as did i
---
Yes it is still worth getting into the game.  I suggest trying the core game out for a little bit before jumping on the subscription though, find out if you will be playing enough.
---
There is a very strong player economy.  Players can create vendors at their camps to sell to other players
---
The community is very active.
---
There are new players popping up every day so chances you will find another fellow noob to play with is almost 100%.  People are posting here every day looking for people to join them.
---
i *KNOW*  - this place does suck - I totally agree with you
---
Yes, since launch :) an SSD and wired internet connection has helped though.
---
If legendary characters becomes a thing (talked about before), you reset your character so it would be useful.  I still have my "Vampiric Beta Stomper"-  A level 5 Vampires, explosive, 15% vats Laser Rifle, that I will never part with.  So yes while yours is level 15, it will help you out until you get one better at high levels, and hopefully in the future.  Btw Great drop 👍
---
Yes totally worth it, glad I bought a year of it! Can wait for the Wastelanders to roll out!
---
" Consumers will always take advantage if systems available to them "
---
I need you to clarify to me right goddamn now, that you are defending corporations with this unholy amalgamation of words.
---
i hadn't even gotten to this yet
---
" Fraud is rampant with online consumers "
---
jfc
---
The games i was refering to offer more content than this does on the f2p section which was what i was getting at but sure i dont have a problem with dlc i use to buy dlc all the time
---
I burnt myself out too, and missed Meat Week. I haven’t played in a few months. 
---
I got back in when they announced Wastelanders. I was disappointed that it was pushed back, but Fallout 1st brought me back. 
---
Scrap Box: Less grinding, I can store so much junk I no longer have to pick and choose what I pick up. I’m a pack rat, so it’s awesome. 
---
Tent: Super cool. I placed mine by the ammo factory, so it’s an easy pvp spot where I can regroup if I’m killed. 
---
Private Server: I’ve only used it once, but when I get more time I plan on capturing every workshop and stocking up on junk to sell. It was weird, knowing that no one could mess with me or take my junk if I die. Not sure if I’ll use it much. 
---
Anyway, I was burnt out on the game and now I’m back at it. Working on hitting everything I’ve missed since I’ve been gone as well as improving my character to get ready for Wastelanders.
---
Ha! Forget that! It’s Bethesda. Enjoy Fallout 1st suckers, y’all deserve it. https://falloutfirst.com
---
The only workshop I care about is Hemlock Holes Maintenance.
---
By your own admission, there IS a paywall in 14. There are no free trials for Fallout 76 with required membership afterward. Fallout's subscription is not needed at all to play the entire core game. That is not the case with FF14. Period. There is no comparison.
---
It must be nice to be the authority on fair value. Unfortunately most laws disagree with you.
---
The reaction you just wrote is exactly what they want... you know that right?
---
What did you hope to accomplish by posting this?
---
Shame about your lack of consumer protection laws. Might be an idea to vote for anyone that'll give you these basic protections when you can.
---
Just restart the storyline. Keep your stuff, just have the Vault open in a diff year. Things get ret-conned all the time, why not start with a fresh slate?
---
You mean T-60 right?
---
A bit presumptuous of you to assume I'm ignorant of business models that have existed for years, and which I have interacted with in the games that I play.
---
In any case, no I wouldn't expect a person moving the goalposts to declare they were doing so. That would be dumb.
---
&gt;They all over some sort of cash payment that increases carry weight, inventory space, increased xp, etc. You know, **real** P2W mechanics. 
---
Please. Please define the line between **real** P2W monetization and only quasi-P2W monetization. Because most would agree that buying a mechanical advantage qualifies as pay to win.
---
Furthermore, since you reference MMOs and Korean games without any specific examples, I will point out that those games are, in general, free to play. Getting the bulk of their monetization through subscription tiers or microtransactions that often can be described as P2W.
---
&gt;Giving you some extra stash space in a game in which another player has **zero** impact on your gameplay experience isn’t even in the same area code as P2W. 
---
You continue to shift goal posts. Pay 2 Win doesn't necessitate a PvP environment or even the existence of another player. If you could pay extra money for extra stim packs in Fallout 2, that too would be P2W.
---
&gt;You can climb down off your high horse now. Just because you’ve lived under a rock and this is the 1st time you’ve heard of something like this doesn’t mean the goalposts are moving.
---
You can step away from my high horse because you clearly aren't qualified to groom my magnificent steed.
---
Glad to oblige then, still managed to get full rewards for myself but will call our cancer when the cunt community rears its fugly head
---
Again, I respect your opinion and I’m not trying to blow you off. 
---
My two cents is that you’d be struggling with your stash space regardless of whether that person purchased the service or not. You only feel exponentially more frustrated because you’re comparing your current predicament with the other individual. 
---
I’m sorry the game is dead to you. I truly am. I’ve been struggling myself since Survival Mode went down. So I definitely understand your frustration. Different strokes for different folks.
---
Agree, partially.
---
Make it a tiered system for example: Maybe make a scrapbox that's free for everyone but it has a limit of 800 (like the regular stash). Subscribe to Fo1st, then the limit is removed.
---
Blizzard and Bethesda are in 2 different leagues as far as gaming goes. 
---
Blizzard has had paid subscription services for its core games for decades.
---
Bethesda started 5  years ago, and has not yet had the time to build a playerbase like Diablo, WoW, Starcraft, Overwatch, ect.
---
Blizzard had the worlds most successful selling game of all time with starcraft, and held that title for decades, since the 90s. 
---
WoW was the largest subscription based MMO ever created, it dethroned EQ, and is still going strong.
---
These 2 games alone put Blizzard in a class of its own.   Lets not even get into the other top titles they created.
---
Maybe try again to your local body/member &amp; sites the ACCC ruling.
---
I agree with you, I think it’s a dick move but that’s what they do...
---
Yup, got it for a month, my mission is to grind all the scrap i can so i can leave a good time without scrap farming and just roam enjoying the game and the not meta guns that are just fun like the fatman.
---
Those are really QoL features. Personally I think the Scrapbox should be available to everyone. Charging subscription is fine for private servers, free atoms every month, exclusive atom shop items but not for in-game features like the Scrapbox.
---
Years and years without a single win.
---
I mean I feel ya, people are too sensitive. But I have to rephrase my words all thr time because I think so differently from other people. I say something that I mean, but the person who hears it thinks of something entirely different. And not always an pffensive way. Sometime just completely different but still benign. 
---
It translates even worse with text where there is no tone to help understand the meaning.
---
Holding out hope. ESO was horrific at launch but eventually turned into a better experience. Given the 1st subscription is ESO+, I'm making the (maybe not so) big assumption that the two games will mirror each other. Might take stealing a few competent devs along the way...  ;)
---
Hey everyone, it’s another person who doesn’t understand what P2W is.
---
Eh, let the trolls come.  Running around and wasting scortch beasts is getting boring anyway, legendary or no.
---
I’m “shilling” for pointing out the truth. Lmao. 
---
Everyone is still getting (and has gotten) the DLC for free. They’ve worked on the game for nearly a year and have required **zero** payment aside from the game purchase in that time. 
---
Ignorant to assume they’re not going to try to make money at some point. Offering a completely optional service that offers some meager QoL improvements is not the end of the world.
---
How much does the vault tec jack O'lantern plan go for? Any help is appreciated
---
The current map is very big and has room to add new things as well as renovate current structures like the space station.
---
If it were possible to run workshops without PVP and make pacifist mode 100% non-combat, i would be inclined to agree, but thats not the case.
---
Yeah cunts are always going to be cunts, doesnt mean we shouldnt/cant call them out beacuse of it, just beacuse they crave the attention and will view getting called out as nurishment, these people live sad and lonely lives and im hear to let them all know that they are indeed infact scum :)
---
Exactly. I guess it’s an unpopular opinion
---
lol, if people give you heat just cause you like something they don't can you really call them friends? As stated in my comment, I understand people can get frustrated with some of the things related to fallout 76 such as the canvas bag  issue. However, it should also be noted that two wrongs don't make a right.
---
That sounds like a good plan actually, probably gonna try that myself
---
Or have multiple containers that each increaee your overall storage at the cost of camp budget.
---
The private servers cant be free. Hosting isnt free.
---
You make a website you have two expenses right of the start. The Domain name (www.yourdomain.com) and the Hosting (the place where your websites files are stored and where your website runs from). Then you may have administrative fees and web designer fees.
---
Now the scrapbox like I mentioned in a previous comment what BGS could do is: Make it a tiered system for example: Maybe make a scrapbox that's free for everyone but it has a limit of 800 (like the regular stash). Subscribe to Fo1st, then the limit is removed.
---
We had a whole clan @ one point, but most people couldn't tolerate the bugs early after release and played for a month or 2 then it was just me and the ole lady. This is a game where the more ppl you have teamed up the better for sure, you also have to make your own fun more often than not because you can't rely on deep, lore filled content from devs any more....they just want the nickels and dimes to not have to put out anything meaningful that's actually worth a dollar..
---
Too lazy. I work hard for my money, so should they. They won't get a dime from me until I see some hard work going into this game.
---
I did the same as the guy that downvoted you.
---
Totally agree... that’s why a lot of people opted in for private servers.
---
Your angry retort supports my first supposition of your emotional need  but not necessarily only of the game Resorting to name calling swearing etc denotes a poverty of emotional regulation. You seem to bristle at any comment you perceive as not supporting your thinking fully. It must be difficult for you
---
If it is anything like the last time I will get a generic "no refund for you" response. But I will give it a shot.
---
Call it what it is. Unlimited junk space. It's not unlimited stash space
---
Yep Found this out the hard way.
---
What matters most is the point of requesting the refund. If you played a year &amp; then request a refund is very different to playing a month &amp; doing the same.
---
Same with taking a bit VS eating the whole meal &amp; then requesting a refund due to poor quality food.
---
Fuck i want a refund too
---
Eh, I say let the trolls come. Killing scorched beasts is getting pretty boring anyway, legendary or not.
---
cool I'll give that a try as I always play in FP. Thanks see ya in the waste!
---
Those low level high tier weapons are valuable for people wanting to level up their alts. They are the sort of weapons you want when starting out.
---
Do you have any graphs on what their expense to profit ratio is for Fo1st? monthly?
---
Regardless, 25 hours is substantial amount of time to recognize whether you like something or not.
---
Thank you for your courage.
---
Weird, I sat there for a good 60 seconds waiting to see if it would unfreeze, definitely haven't seen it before and I buy from vendors countless times a day. I know there's no getting it back, it's all good, I just wondered if anyone else experienced this or not.
---
lol wait so people who didn't play are gonna have to pay for characters and maps?
---
My opinion of Australia has gone from a 6 to an 8 the only think stoping it from being a 10 is cause my simple mind cannot fathom that y'all's Christmas is in summer
---
If the post was as well-written and civil as the title...I’m going to say no, not really.
---
As I'm sure a lot of people in the community are the same.
---
If more people fought back like you these companies would stop releasing broken games.
---
I do tho
---
Don't run or try to do anything that would stress lag the game too much.
---
 Switch out your pipboy to the clear view instead of the animation. It helps with lag idk why a simple animation causes lag
---
Try to wait for things to load
---
Dont use autos or explosives
---
Dont try to vats much
---
What does Jim Sterling say thats apparently so low IQ?
---
i wonder if it uses encryption, and how hard to reverse engineer
---
You have lines of people waiting for you to repair/mod their PA? It sounds more like " I have to better manage my storage" you *should* be able to keep the junk you need to repair PA in stock. ESPECIALLY if you mod/repair t-60 since it has the lowest mat cost...
---
2) Probably.
---
3) Lag
---
6) **Bug**: Probably not new. Failed the Encryptid event but I remained the Conduit which kept killing me over and over. Only relog fixed it. [https://youtu.be/FhiQsSFUI7w](https://youtu.be/FhiQsSFUI7w)
---
Yes max level
---
Yeah same here im on xbox and i get maybe 2 runs a day at it on my lunch break and usually crash once on it and at least once an hour doing the Atom challenges
---
Nah, they didn't forget. They're just pivoting but it's OK because they listened to our feedback &amp; give us Inside the Vault articles as always &amp; have committed to not giving any competitive advantage with their communications.
---
i would like if even ptt worked with a controller:(
---
No brotherhood originally used Winterized T-51b haha
---
Or realize they've been hating on something that deserves to be hated and keep on going lmao
---
The game is trash.
---
I got get crashes that often, only time I have any problem is when everyone in the server is at the same event.
---
I don't understand why people actually wanted an online multiplayer Fallout game to begin with.
---
An online co-op with friends? Yeah, sure.. that would be pretty nice.
---
The overwhelming majority of players online in any game are toxic losers who try to use video games as a way to idiotically take out their frustrations on other players. 
---
Harsh? Maybe. True? Definitely.
---
Don't act like r/fo76filthycasuals is bad because they don't allow players to bad mouth the game. Filthy Casuals was created and exist solely for people who just enjoy the game. Here are some of thier rules because you couldn't be bothered to read them before you post nonsense.
---
&gt;Rule 3.No bashing
---
&gt;Posts &amp; Comments
---
&gt;This sub was created for and by people who don't want to listen to all the hate and negativity. No bashing the game. No bashing Bethesda. No bashing on the people who are enjoying the game. No bashing other Fallout related subs. That's not fun. Take it elsewhere.
---
&gt;Rule 4. No hardcore elitism
---
&gt;We don't care that you are level 150 and blast nukes 24/7. This is a place for the casual players. It's all about the journey! If you are a casual and you are high level, great! If you are a casual and still a noob, welcome! Don't be an asshole to lower levels just starting out.
---
&gt;Rule 5. No complaining
---
&gt;No complaining about bugs. Feel free to post workarounds, but whining about bugs isn't going to get them fixed any sooner. If you really want to complain about them, go do it in one of the other Fallout subs please.
---
So you're so fucking deluded that you agree with a moron who says "The downvotes are from all the people that work at Bethesda".
---
What does that say about you.
---
I bought the subscription and there is a huge difference between private and public. Last night i was on public for a bit and it was ridiculous the load time not just logging into a server but also fast travel with areas loading in, super slow.
---
Outer worlds have loot? Like armour pieces weapon customization?
---
That's about .27 cents a day... sounds pretty micro to me. You also aren't pigeonholed into purchasing that particular subscription either
---
Can’t you just have a server made for events and turn nuking off or does that make too much sense for Bethesda ?
---
Thanks for keeping up with these posts. Glad to see that you're not being cynically downvoted to hell.
---
Shame about the lack of response from Bethesda. They normally would have been all over this showering it with praise.
---
Speaking of praise, some nice shots you got there :)
---
Nah not really. I only used a private server on a small number of occasions. I recently found better ways than taking over workshops for resources. Such as, unlimited low level scorch spawns at my base and a great location for my survival tent to ft to and get legendary spawns or wendigos almost guaranteed. And best of all, don't need a private server for that.
---
It gives us more option on how we approach things like some have already said that you would need lvl 5 of demoliton expert perk and that it would cost one or more of your own explosives and that it would attract enemies rather when you pick it with Bobby pins
---
Considering that a multitude of people would have gotten the refund immediately, given opportunity. Kinda makes the fact it's been a year completely irrelivent.
---
yeah this is a really great idea
---
Lol dude relax
---
Felt this since 2007 after the release of C &amp; C 3.
---
Publicly traded video game companies are not sustainable because unlimited growth is impossible.
---
I would honestly make this a sticky if I was a mod. The paid Bethesda shills are going to try and bury this with downvotes. I encourage all to upvote this post.
---
I read your post earlier in fairness it was well written and a generally good post. I think it was removed because of the title. Otherwise it was a good post.
---
Wastelanders.
---
Thats part of the upcoming subscription, fallout 2nd, for all the ingame utility's that should have been there from launch for only $30 a month!
---
Its T-51, T-60 was fallout 4s brotherhood armor. But i repair all kinds. Are far as lines no it was about 6-9 recurring customers with some randos whenever i felt like peddling my services. If i didnt have to worry about scrap space i could have had more sets ready to sell.
---
Don't expect map extension for a good time, they said before launch that they will focuse the new content on the actual map, then after that probably add new map content
---
Biggest issue with this event is the pathetic rewards it drops. Kills all the desire to go there.
---
Of course? It's an MMORPG with thousands potentially tens of thousands of hours of content with near constant free updates. A sub fee for that is pretty acceptable (although I wish they didnt have a cash shop too but eh) and is an amazing value. 
---
Fallout 1st by comparison offers you very little for the same price aside from things the community has been begging for for months. Furthermore the bigger issue is that if the sub is at all successful, we'll start seeing it in lots of other games. If you want to be paying a sub for every major "AAA" game you buy for things that were previously free then hey great but most of the rest of us would rather not.
---
Yeah it's just a whole mess of ignorant fanboys its pretty bad.
---
Yea but, laws aren't agreeing with his feelings so..  He bought the game and hated it and wants to dictate how everyone "should" handle the situation.  Which is to get scammed big time
---
Yeah, no.
---
Here in Australia it doesn't matter how long you play for, if the game or product is not as advertised in any capacity, or is faulty (Fallout 76 is a faulty mess), you're entitled to a refund by law.
---
If you expect to sell your video game in Australia, don't expect people to not refund it if it's broken. Consumer rights is literally the one area where our government doesn't fuck us, so damnit we're using that right to its fullest in situations like this.
---
It **is** a sticky.
---
That'd be Elisabeth Warren.
---
I'd submit a ticket if I were you. That seems pretty stupid if the only people on the server are max level(50+).
---
I can agree to that. But maybe it’s just a collective experience of reading different threads and would apply better to others rather then this one. 
---
Keep an eye out. You’ll notice it more and more now. Once I noticed it - it drives me nuts now.
---
Yea its not but a major portion of the stash no longer needs to be worried about.
---
It’s a private match, not a server and are you expecting to see lvl 250+ enemies? Cuz that isn’t gonna happen.
---
Because if fallout 1st is at all a success you're going to see it in lots of other big "AAA" games. This is the first non MMORPG sub based game, what do you seriously think will happen if Bethesda makes a profit from it??
---
It holds so little and slows spoilage so little that is basically all it is useful for.
---
Except you will be. If this is at all a success then have fun paying sub fees for allllll of your "AAA" games lol.
---
Nope no scale otherwise kinda abusable people would complain
---
Wouldn't that be nice.
---
Again, missing the point. These companies aren’t going to stop because a couple people got upset over a setup of microtransactions so shut up about it?
---
People are complaining that a AAA studio released a bugged out glitchy unfinished game that has had a year to fix and are still having some of the same problems since launch. And yea the microtransactions bein so inflated jus kick us while were down. The other games u mentioned at least came out finished and smooth gameplay with very little problems. I think if bethesda waited a year or so before launching to iron out alot of their problems it prolly wouldnt have gotten or still be gettin all the hate
---
I never bought it because it looked like everything I never wanted in a Fallout game.
---
3rd party hosting will never happen if characters can move between public and private servers.
---
I ca usually solo it until the last section - when robots appear out of nowhere while I;m trying to complete the last few things. Usually assaultrons - that last section gives you only about 4 minutes before the legendary sentry bot appears.
---
Haven't managed to do it yet.  So close.
---
Jesús. 
---
Fallout New Vegas literally offered you direct P2W advantages from pre ordering the game. You got a canteen (prevented dehydration) a grenade launcher (pretty OP to walk out of the tutorial with) and other goodies. 
---
Black Desert is buy to play. With an optional sub that gives increased carry weight, reduced fees from the auction house, and increases to exp gains. They also have flat carry weight you can straight up buy, as well as pets that loot faster, costumes that **hide your name and identifying titles**, and market items you can buy with real money and then sell for silver in game. 
---
It’s also arguably the most popular mmorpg on the market aside from WoW. Don’t take my word though. Go hit the steam charts. And the majority of players play straight through the game client, 
---
Pay 2 Win does require competitive aspects to be applicable. That’s what “winning” means. For you to win, someone has to lose. If at the end of a soccer game both teams “win” regardless of the score, then no one has won. This isn’t a terribly difficult concept, but maybe sitting on your high horse you aren’t getting enough oxygen. 
---
Again, **real** Pay to win implies there is some fucking way of winning. Because that would imply you get a **real advantage**. If you have more stash space than I do in 76, it’s not an **advantage**. It just **is**. You having more space than I do has **absolutely no impact** on my individual game experience. 
---
If this was a full loot PvP game where I had a limited storage space but you had an infinite one because you subscribed, that would be an **advantage**.  And that would definitely be classified as P2W. 
---
The same would be said If this was a game where acquiring the most amount of caps was rewarded with special skins and titles. There would be competition for those titles and skins. 
---
Again, there is **zero** competition in 76. You cannot have winning without competition. 
---
****I do not support Bethesda’s decision to lock features behind a paywall, but calling it P2W is incorrect. It’s just shitty ethically. That’s all.****
---
And? Both games still launched in better states and even at launch had arguably vastly more content and of higher quality and unless I'm totally remembering wrong ESO didn't even launch with a sub fee just buy 2 play I think. I'll have to google it I could be wrong.
---
Can you update your subject? It says 'dear player' and I assume you meant deaf.
---
So to be clear here..  
---
If I deliver you a pizza and it has the wrong ingredients and is missing cheese on half you just eat it and be a man about it right?
---
It really could have been. Ive been into fallout since 3 and it would have been so great if 76 turned out good.
---
Why not just hook up some randoms? 
---
It'd spread more god will. Your stuff will most likely only end up with traders if you do this.
---
No offense to the traders but it'd be better if these items hit players who would use the gear.
---
Spamming. Constantly.
---
Right?! Look at all these salty downvotes xD
---
It's an event with very low chances or rare items that only pop up once a hour... Half the time the game crashes on its own. Bothers me because I finished the event and didnt get the loot.
---
Because ESO is an MMORPG and Fallout 76 is a generic multiplayer survival game. A non MMORPG has no excuse to ever have a sub.
---
I hear you. My plan is to drop things randomly around vault 76 just giving people a heads up. I’m not taking requests either, you get what you get.
---
I don't even play the game anymore personally but I'm pissed and a lot of other people are too because the sub is extremely dangerous for the "AAA" market and if it's at all a success will seriously hurt all of us.
---
So to be clear here..
---
Would if I could.
---
Double walls still work - my CAMP has had some for a while, and just a few weeks ago I changed all of my interior walls to double walls. Kills your budget if you have a complex layout (like I do), but felt it was so worth it to be able to have all of my rooms looking exactly the way I want it. I found using the Barn Doorframe wall worked best for me. Also works for half walls and angle walls.
---
Apparently autocorrect wanted to be extra polite
---
Game is fun as hell. I put in 700 hours. I only stopped because its slowly becoming pay to win. If you're ok with that, have at it.  The in game economy ESPECIALLY is amazing. So fun trading with other people. You can literally post your CAMP up as a store for people to visit. Its wonderful.
---
Around the time the sun swallows the planet.
---
Yes it is worth it, i have been going back and forth between public and private and it is a huge difference in load times alone. I have yet to have a disconnect or any other error. I bought when it first came out and just the fact that areas are not cleared out when i get there is great, i have been able to get a bunch of legendaries with no issues at all. To me it is worth it.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
Bethesda Softworks LLC is an American video game publisher based in Rockville, Maryland. The company was founded by Christopher Weaver in 1986 as a division of Media Technology Limited, and in 1999 became a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media.
---
Oh? Why won't they? Are you saying internet backlash has never made a difference?? Are you saying that if not enough people purchase something it will still be called a success?? Were you just born?
---
do u think pay-to-win has the potential to kill the existing economy?
---
I've never listened to the hollotapes as you can probably imagine, but my fiance signed some and gave up.
---
Then I guess I’ll stop paying my bills then
---
Fallout wishes it could be everything ESO is. I'm not even going to throw up any bullet points, because anyone with any sort of intelligence will know how much better ESO is with stability, content, player feedback, etc. It's not even up for debate.
---
I'm not pissed they're charging for Private servers. I think the membership should just be Private World access and maybe 500 atoms a month for $5 or $6 a month, not $13 for all these in game advantages, infinite junk storage and a second fast travel spot that can keep someones camp from loading in... They dont even have more than one package option (yeah 12 month sub for the same shit). The extras are things that should be in the game with a quest or something, I dont care if they want to give a million atoms and outfits and dances and crap for free, too. But releasing CONTENT that is not FREE goes against what they said.
---
Well 100 is for the year, I think most of us pay month to month. I don’t know if I’ll be playing in a year so certainly didn’t drop that much coin
---
Yup, it was EB Games here in my town, then it transformed into Gamestop lol
---
I would love if this was implemented. I just don’t trust Bethesda enough to get it together and do something like this. I hope to be proven wrong though!
---
at first reading the title i though you sold bugs to a vendor lol
---
&gt; Yeah, if he moves to Australia he'd have to deal with less crime, less gun violence and free healthcare. The horror.
---
That's true of any other first-world country.
---
Most of them have less spiders than Australia.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
For money i think they would
---
Where did you see officially stated that it scales?  
---
My assumption is the opposite, it just works like any fo76 server.  Areas have a default level the enemies initially spawn at, and once they respawn they scale to the player that respawned them within a range.  So forest areas might spawn lvl 1-15 or so, and 15 is the max.  The bog might spawn lvl 25-100+ and 25 is the minimum.  So forth and so on.  
---
So for whitesprings it ranges pretty wide like 6-68 or so, and if you run through with low level characters you will get low level (re)spawns.
---
It was a wall of text that was getting awards before anyone could have read it, and the OP was declaring opinions invalid when that was pointed out.
---
I just played all the way to the end killed the legendary sentry bot grabbed my legendary plasma the mischief night event complete comes up and then server control unresponsive then kick out load menu.  Quickly join a world and all the events rewards and my legendary plasma are gone.  Such bullshit.
---
Then. Don't. Buy. The. Subscription. This isn't an MMO. I wasn't promised an MMO. I didn't expect an MMO. I didn't buy an MMO. I'm not entitled to the same content as an MMO. It's an exploration game with light survival elements with the opportunity to interact with other players in the world.
---
The core game is completeable upon purchase. No subscription needed. Any additional free content Bethesda provides - be it missions, free shop items, events, or a complete overhaul like Wastelanders, is above and beyond what I paid for. 
---
I've reached the endgame having only spent the $60 for the main game at launch. I did not feel compelled to buy atoms or get the subscription, and the availability of both to others, and my lack of purchase - did not in any way impact my ability to complete the game.
---
If you don't feel the subscription is valuable, don't buy it. I'm not.
---
With most shitty dying games only the fanatics stay for this long.
---
Oh dear, not your precious karma!
---
My favourite was from before I lost my hearing completely, a bus driver asked me if I was deaf. I took my hearing aid out and said yup! I have never seen a man look so pale and utterly ashamed in my life.
---
On the other hand, you have to live in Australia. Refund for 76 or fighting real live giant insects?
---
Just kidding; it's a beautiful country that obviously cares about consumer rights.
---
Sounds like Euro commie bullshit, but okay.
---
The way it currently is?  Only minimal impact on junk economy, since subscribers can store unlimited junk and non-subscribers cant.  So subscribers will own that part of the market. No telling how they'll affect it long term. But I dont really see the values changing too much, they've been at steady values for a while. 
---
But if they make any updates where you can buy weapons and armor, then definitely. There are market subs (I'm not aloud to name them here) mostly deal in rare weapons and armor, and bulk high value junk purchases.
---
Imagine feeling this cool about yourself
---
The cabins above bolton green? On no you poor soul. High level super mutants spawn there and a suicider mutant lol. If you're on xbox I might have seen you run all the way back to my base below bolton green. You missed out on a 3 star legendary lol.
---
Eyebot.  Huh....Interesting.  
---
Been playing since January, never heard /seen that before.
---
Thank!
---
I do play others, and some game developers are better than others, but there seems to be a distinct lack of help for differently-abled people
---
I’d rather have more lesser known songs than a few popular songs. I don’t see why they can’t add some more tracks over time, but also the games OST is so damn good I usually don’t even use the radio anymore.
---
Gods I hope not!
---
they said "one of the biggest" and there's been no hint of a map extension.  So who knows, they might just mean biggest in the amount of stuff it adds to the game (new items, new npc's, new quests etc).   
---
Personally I don't think there will be a huge new land mass or similar but rather any new areas will be instanced like Vault 94 and still lie within the map we have now.
---
fu bugthesda !!!!
---
Dont be a douche.
---
If you're referring to the Scout Armor Masks, while it's not a helmet per se, you \_can\_ equip it with some head cover items, like the BOS Hood, which really does help with how it looks on the character. More options would always be nice though.
---
😂😂😂 you're so butthurt
---
I disagree that spending hours on a game inherently determines value, but disagree **far** more that continuing to play the game you paid for after you've been denied a refund invalidates your refund request.
---
The first point is debatable, the second is straight-up crazytalk.
---
I agree
---
Good for you. Screw those lying thieves and forget the Beth circlejerk going on around here. It's full of Beth shills. Have an upvote!
---
I miss Babbages too.
---
&gt; It just seems like such a kick in the teeth to see them just ignore feedback that would make their game - and now their subscription service - better.
---
Where did you see that?
---
I had no idea! Im trying it when i get home
---
What did I write that contradicts what I've written
---
I can access it, maybe you got banned OP
---
Pathetic Fallout nerds are actually downvoting this. Sad
---
It's really hit and miss what does and doesn't work. Someone in this subreddit posted an image a while back of the Armored Raider Skull Gas Mask (Atom Shop) worn in conjunction with the Scout Armor Mask. Why the game allows that is probably due to a bug, but it actually looks really cool. Doesn't work with the normal Raider Skull Gas Mask though.
---
But yeah. BOS Hood definitely works, probably some others. I didn't like how the mask just left the back of your head open, and that helped a lot.
---
Store them serverside and that issue goes away.  Just like playing minecraft or ARK (unless theve changed it in the last few years.)
---
I also got the tricentennial version, after they announced fallout first, I uninstalled, nothing is worth getting ass pounded that hard by a game company.
---
...and?
---
Kind of a lame way but hiding in a bush and then ambushing people is how I usually play. Often the point of the game is to catch people moving away from the fire so it's good practice to watch the hills while hidden. Dont immediately attack people but wait until you have a good vats chance to knock them down in one or two seconds. Any longer and he's already healing. Think of it as a cheetah. Uses all of their energy now to catch them fully at a surprise. Unless you're a sniper and know exactly where people would funnel through. You can get a few surprise kills.
---
I must admit it was very handy to drop a stash box at taken workshops, and scrap and stash at same time.    The very definition of convenience.
---
This is great, thanks!
---
There are plenty of games that would never work on this model. Take for instance Destiny 2: how would private servers help, when everyone is after matchmaking? How would a game like WoW work when you go to run dungeons or raids and need to PUG 3 people because your off healer and two DPS dropped out? How would Call of Duty multiplayer work? I’m at an absolute loss as to how this would work outside of a sandbox style game. And not many companies are trying to make themed sandbox games. All the sandbox games like Minecraft already host private servers at a monthly fee. 
---
I was one of the guys when the game was first announced that wanted the option of not playing with other people. I wanted to explore the game with just friends, but that’s not what I got and ultimately I made even more friends as a result. As a FO1st member, I get the private servers to play with my friends I wanted for farming and just messing around while having the opportunity to go play with new people and hopefully make friends. 
---
I think the biggest issue for a lot of people aren’t the servers, atoms, outfits, or emotes; it’s the whole scrap box thing. Where I can see why people are mad, Bethesda/Zenimax is renting extra servers for FO1st members, meaning with the space from those rentals is what’s giving the capacity to have “unlimited” junk space. I’m still restricted to 800 for my weapons, armor, and aid items but it doesn’t hurt me as much because I don’t have to juggle junk on top of it all. The game has been out for over a year now and Bethesda hasn’t asked for more money for the additional content they’ve added, as sparse as it may be. Adding private servers was a convenience they recognized not everyone was interested in, and the people who saw value in the package would invest and those not interested wouldn’t. 
---
I’m pushing toward 1400 hours in game, for the $100 I payed for the Tricentennial edition. I rarely get 100 hours out of a $60 title, so to hit 1400 I felt comfortable spending $13 a month at my leisure to add another element to the game I’ve invested so much time into. I consistently play with the same group of 4 other guys with another 4 coming and going regularly and two of us have private servers. So 9 people are in and out of our two servers and we get to have a great time without trying to coordinate onto a public server.
---
In Aus and NZ, consumers are not required to accept minor flaws or a product that is not fit for purpose.  The game, at launch, was not fit for purpose.  Australians and New Zealanders are entitled to a refund at that point.  However what the enforcement agencies REALLY take offense to is an organisation misleading customers about their rights.  "NO REFUNDS!" signs are illegal in stores here.  (other than some very specific exceptions).  If you tell people they're not entitled to a refund when they are, you almost guarantee that the ACCC (in Australia or MBIE in NZ) are going to find in the consumer's favour if a complaint is made.  Which obviously it was and for good reason.
---
Year.
---
username checks out.
---
I agree should be invite only, ended up deleting my whole list because of that. Which was not a big deal they were just players i traded with at one point.
---
Same, I haven’t had a single crash and only a few players insta-killing the legendary sentry
---
I actually lol'd at that one.
---
Yeah, I get it.  There are times when I just want to wander the wastelands on my own.
---
Now the US courts need to do the same !!!
---
A more apt summary would be 'Online retail is rampant with consumer fraud.'
---
Greed is not exclusive to corporate structures. There are plenty of people who pay for a product, use it thoroughly, and return it when they're done so they don't pay for it. 
---
There are literally people you can hire, to get free stuff for you online, and they just dispute it with the company or payment processor. 
---
Why pay 2000$ ordering a really nice couch online, when you can pay someone 300$ and get the couch for free?
---
I don't mean all consumers are like this, but a lot are. Enough to hurt small businesses, sure the big guys can eat it up, but it's a lot bigger hit on the small businesses.
---
Please, don't.
---
Bethesda already take too much between each update; mix up all platforms would extend the time needed between updates.
---
They ran out of Potato Crisp and needed a salty snack. 
---
I'm going to run Cannibal after reading this.
---
What will you ever do without your 1 star legendary, golf outfit and the pumpkin plans you already have?
---
Hopefully Bethesda fixes their shit before more dumbasses like you continue to ruin the game.
---
This is really the point that the ACCC will have a problem with.  Companies may not blatantly lie to consumers about their rights.  "You are not entitled to a refund" - yes, you are.  By law.  By saying otherwise, the company has broken Australian law, and they should have known better.    The Australian law was drafted from the New Zealand consumer guarantees act so the same should apply in NZ too.
---
r/shitamericanssay
---
I know right!
---
r/everyfuckingthread
---
Thanks for this!
---
Do you to show lower price point would increase profits?
---
Do you think they pick price points out of thin air? They crunch the numbers on how they expect a particular price point to do, this is not a unique thing. This type of work goes into virtually all marketing. What is the highest they can charge and still have a profitable number of users?
---
They were afraid of text chat lagging too much. Probably didn’t know it can be on a separate server.
---
Have you played fallout 76
---
THIS.  
---
I love the Enclave plasma weapons but without legendary effects and the ability to mod 'em properly they are just meh.
---
It’s more about making a point to Bethesda that people will fight them when they are that deep in the wrong
---
Someone’s downvoting all the anti Bethesda comments so I’m upvoting them
---
Have you played this game?
---
You should very well understand why he wanted a refund
---
Op of this post made a post the other day how mischief night event is p2w and goes further claiming xbox one x console owners have a p2w advantage. Either a troll or someone who's opinion i don't trust in the least
---
I guess I meant more of fans initially defended it, because honestly there was a lot of potential at launch despite the issues. I was one, so I get what people liked. I played it for a long time. But Bethesda just made us look stupid thinking better of them. it's like every opportunity they could screw up they took it. So Bethesda made us look like idiots.
---
This is me
---
I like the game, it has potential, the only reason I haven’t gotten a refund is because I want to believe that it’ll be good in a year or two, so I’m just not playing it until I see something good on this sub
---
Yeah my reaction to the comment was just to laugh and realize it was probably a pointless question to ask given Bethesda's track record thus far with the game.  So many MMOs have this figured out already, Bethesda doesn't even need to be creative or original, just literally put in the effort.    
---
Making me close out the game and open a ticket on the website frankly just encourages lazy behavior, i.e., not doing it at all, which at this point I'm half convinced is intentional.
---
Lmao your getting downvoted
---
I gotchu
---
I think of it more like this:
---
PizzaPlace has been producing pizza for years, and I've ate there a lot. However, over the years quality has declined, and I've enjoyed their pizza less. They release a new specialty pizza, say bacon and pineapple for example. I order it, hoping their quality has improved in their new addition to the menu. However once I receive it, there are a few pieces of bacon on the pizza that were burnt, and there's only a few small bits of pineapple on each slice, with the pineapple being clearly out of season. 
---
It's a bad pizza, and I didn't enjoy it much or finish it, but it was what I ordered. Next time I won't order from PizzaPlace anymore, as I no longer trust the quality of their pizzas for the price.
---
Yeah thats the only one i care about also, need me my acid.
---
Within a few days or so, sure. Months after?
---
Name me one small business pushing a games as a service model product. Go ahead, i'll wait. Name me one small business advertising at e3 a product that they arent delivering
---
It
---
Is
---
A
---
Joke
---
Niiiice.  I'm thinking th he same for the camp and stash
---
Won't make a difference, we're like the biggest torrenting pirates on the planet =)
---
Last I heard, it has not been fixed
---
It does not scale, which is bullshit, and maybe the main reason I don't continue my sub. Even my alts are all 50+, there is no reason for lvl 5 mobs to exist anywhere in my world.
---
But if you think the backlash over the stash/tent is bad, wait until the salty butthurt from the unwashed masses over "P2W farming advantages".
---
I played it and no I don't understand it because the game is fun and I like it, it lacks some content but its being added.. and I didn't tell anything wrong and already have been downvoted.. I only said the truth that Bethesda didn't owe him money because he paid it by him self, and I didn't tell anything against, I didn't support what Bethesda is doing so if that's the reason to downvote okay fine...
---
Yes i would like my money back, but I’m keeping the product I want my money back on
---
Imagine doing that irl going to a store and asking for a refund then taking the product and the cash like a fucking lemon
---
They did a maintenance the next day. Its fixed.
---
As far as we know, the problem was fixed. But to be honest, I got it on release (my platform is PS4) and I never had any problems.
---
Imagine voluntarily exchanging currency for a product and then thinking it's your "right" to be given your money back because you don't like the thing you bought. 
---
r/shiteuropoorssay
---
It was fixed with the last hotfix.
---
What do you mean they nuked legendary farming?
---
The sheer amount of bugs and glitches made it insanely un-fun
---
The gameplay is fun and all, but there’s about 3 hours of content at most including nukes,
---
That’s if you don’t count when the nukes went out of service for a month when the year ticked over as nobody thought to program in other years.
---
I went farming all over the place today with a couple of my friends. Probably four hours total, and got one three star. I’d call that nuked.
---
&gt; It will be nice to cross the river and explore the forest on the other side though even if it's only up to the edge of the map
---
There is a section that doesn't have the invisible wall. I ran out to the literal edge of the game map and then the ground turns to quicksand and you fall through, then ported back to the surface just before the "quicksand" area.
---
I get downvoted every time I post in this subreddit, no worries. Thanks, though.
---
SO level 9 ghouls at WS is normal? Not in in my experience 1000+ hrs in
---
I'm also pretty certain OP is giving themselves rewards.
---
The one person at Bethesda who was supposed to test this event was on vacation. Also he doesn’t exist.
---
Have you travelled on all the areas on the map? Gone off course lately? There is a ton of empty space
---
You do know the only communist place currently existing is China and North Korea you fucking watermelon
---
Heugh heugh imma go fuk mah cuzin yee haw ah murcia trump is lord europeens are commie bastards
---
YUUH MURICA IS BEST CUNTRY EVR
---
No I'm expecting WS to not have level 9 ghouls smart ass isn't it a high level area if one even exist anymore
---
I glitched out after riding on the mr Fuzzy ride. Got all the music I could wish for after that. Ran the new event with that song blasting right after. 
---
Good times.
---
I’d call that an unlucky RNG.
---
Nah, nothings broken if you don't want to be a snack don't die.
---
Well your pay was removed but you said they are now being compelled to issue refunds because of marketing
---
I duno if the tent stays put, but I dont think you get to place it anymore, and the stash box can only be withdrawn from, nothing added.
---
I'm sill waiting for an eyepatch.
---
Because it would expose console commands, if not implemented carefully.  BGS track record of quality exploit-free code implementations is shoddy.   Anyone with knowledge of the foundational game code is salivating at the thought of a command text window.  ;)
---
Hopped to different worlds, tried logging in and out, still nothing. This is happening to a bunch of my other friends.
---
That's kind of a bummer to hear.  Truthfully I've completely ignored NW up to this point and only just started to get the Halloween skins.  I really dislike NW mode as it is, and the cheaters just make it that much less enjoyable.    
---
Not that that should be taken as me discouraging others from NW, as it's a lot more popular than I would have figured and obviously really enjoyable to some.
---
How can you tell the difference between an entire server crashing and your own connection simply having a wobble and kicking you off?
---
Yep was already planning on it once my work schedule slows a bit and I get time. Thanks.
---
I fucking wish I could refund mine in the US. So, so badly.
---
I'm usually not hesitant to buy a Bethesda title, especially a fallout or elder scrolls title, but with everything that's happened I think I will be going forward
---
If you just hung around for a minute it would have still issues you the rewards. It’s a funny story and just a game.
---
There was [server maintenance](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/370433/complete-fallout-76-maintenance-october-25-2019?language%5B%5D=en) on Oct 25 that was supposed to address the issue, but it's not clear from the post if the issue was actually fixed...
---
What is certain though is the folks who did lose scrap due to the bug are still without it.
---
Servers for existing games would fall under that.
---
For example, Minecraft. While Mojang released the game, the game has sprouted up several small businesses hosting servers and providing further content for players.
---
These servers usually add gamemodes, different items, mods, etc, and will have different monetization methods. Subscription, one-time fee, in-game purchases, etc.
---
There are plenty of games that are in a constant state of development after 'release'.
---
I've only read it on Reddit.
---
But apparently you get to keep the stash box, but cannot add to it after the subscription end's.
---
I never had an issue with it on the first place.
---
I did notice a ton of my legendary drops have been lame things like walking canes.
---
Man it’s been stupid long all week since the new event. Just crashed loading in after a 3-4min wait. Xbox
---
The one I got today was a two star zealots pole hook.
---
I too have noticed level 9 ghouls around the whitespring both in my private server and a public. I thought at first Bethesda had toned down the spawns so lower levels could participate, but I've also seen the usual level 68s roaming.
---
I haven't had an issue since release, but I also didn't have massive amounts of junk to stash. I managed my on hand junk pretty tightly before, so only dropped around 200 lbs in mine.
---
It will delete your character. Jk.
---
Long-nose tribe always wins 👹
---
I absolutely agree. Anyone saying the fridge is a P2W is crazy.
---
&gt;Stating it is not hate speech because FO1st subsrcibers are not a protected class is like saying racism against white people isnt racism because they are white.
---
Sorry champ, back to 1L con law for you! Race is a protected class, regardless of which race it is.
---
I bought a game in which defined by Australian law is a product. I was sold a product with certain promises, those promises were not kept.
---
When the repair kits were added I took a break from the game out of disagreement with that choice. It may be different in America or other countries but tbh what they did went completely against the direction they sold to consumers
---
How is it able to be abused? If I can kill level 50+ enemies I'm in the right to get their loot and that doesn't stop me from going to the cranberry bog and grinding it then logging out for 20min and doing it all over again so.....
---
It's a recycled server. They just disconnect everyone and you use it on your own
---
I don't know that it's normal, but I've definitely seen low level enemies there.
---
If it's respawning lvl 9s though that does indeed seem weird.
---
I spend a lot of time in private servers and can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that the scaling is broken, but there are things you can do to fix it. 
---
Countless times I’ll nuke an area like WS or the Burroughs and the enemies there will be mid to low level. I immediately leave the world, wait about 90 seconds and join a private server again. It will place you back into the same server and the enemies should then respawn and be properly leveled to you. 
---
If you wait more than 5 minutes though, you will be put into a different server.
---
I actually called the other guy out for giving himself a reward on the post I mentioned lol. I'm just stirring things up.
---
Lol.  My alt is lvl 75 now.  I have yet to get a decent 3 star.
---
Point being it could be worse.
---
Black guns are scary mmmkay?
---
I've had the same problem since last year. I rarely play without headphones so it's not a big deal for me, just a bit irritating that it hasn't been fixed yet.
---
Go to Racer Street yah racerst
---
All those exploding cars.
---
Lol thankfully i got plenty of monopoly money banked up for the down votes.
---
I paid the $100 and feel like I’m happy with it. I like the additional features and though there are a lot of other crappy things I could have spent that money on, I’m satisfied with the purchase. I only play two games, FO76 and GTAO, so maximizing the features of this one was a no-brainer. 
---
In GTA though, conversely, I don’t ever buy shark cards.
---
If only I used my powers for something useful :(
---
No problem. And this'll help as a reminder for me, so I can help the next person with a similar issue by telling them which patch it was. So much obliged to you!
---
For me it's all fun, it's no one's fault that everyone rushed through the main story missions to finish it as fast as possible... That's their own fault.. for me it is fun and always was since the beta, im Happy with the game and don't regret my pre order. I like to jump online and play it to relax run around and make fun stuff.. not everyone has to like what I say but it's my opinion, sure it would be better with NPCs and more content, but it's coming sooner or later, and I won't complain about it, I knew what I was getting into while preordering it, and I knew it's going to be a great game. And so it is, for me. I don't care what others say. I like it and nothing changes it.
---
Oh my bad I thought that was your post. Damn my reading comp needs some work lol.
---
&gt;It was a wall of text that was getting awards before anyone could have read it
---
I was actually the one to call him out for this :D
---
Damn that's next level butt hurt and even deeper level poor man to stick with all that for a refund. 
---
The game is fun 😂😂😂 my God what a world we live in.
---
In what reality do you live in where you would be so self-centered to think anyone at all gives  a f if you do or do not play a silly game.
---
Seriously noone cares.
---
Ya I  dont buy games at EB anymore.
---
It wasn't edited, it was removed by a mod. Wth are you talking about?
---
You never heard of scary black assault weapons like the baby killer ar15?
---
I don't care about music or radio at all in fallout.
---
2 games at once my dude. Welcome to the Future.
---
You got to a restuarant and order a burger, and your server brings you one without a patty. Server then proceeds to tell you that they will add the patty at a later date.  Wouldn't you want a refund?
---
NO  
---
IT  
---
IS  
---
NOT  
---
Because to be a joke it would have to be funny.
---
But there's no metric for that. Any change they make can consitute a refund by the logic your presenting (or at least how I'm understanding it). 
---
A weapon could be OP in this game but if they nerf that could constitute a refund in someone's mind. Fixing a bug that someone enjoyed can constitute a refund. They can play for 100+ hours and decide their bored then demand a refund because the developer isn't making the game interesting anymore.
---
Gaming companies would cease to exist because they couldn't afford to stay open.
---
Also worth noting that there's no way to just buy/rent a private server.  One of the major criticisms is that the servers are bundled with extraneous features that consumers have to pay for.  Including something that violates explicit promises made about the game.  So even people who knew that was coming can argue this was a bad faith move.
---
Nice productive comment.
---
Nice edit bruh
---
Been there, done that. Time to entertain myself.
---
Yes. Run the games exe twice and log in with each account.
---
I’ve spent half a year looking for a handmade like that. Whoever gets it will either be rich for a while or a monster killing machine
---
That's a game and not food... Pretty bad comparison. If you all hate this game so much and all want a refund then why are you still here...? It's a sub Reddit for people who play and like the game. Not for a constantly hate on it and on everyone who says that he enjoys the game...
---
Yes u can open multiple instances of 76 through the exe file.
---
Good job advertising your sub. That's not allowed here, read the rules.
---
Lol I got one too. How do I cash this in?
---
Anyone have an extra Jack o lantern pant suit? I've been doing this even Everytime it shows up... I cannot get it. I have extra jack o lantern short suits. And grim reaper cutout plans. Will trade for it and some caps.
---
Literally have been trying to trade with everyone in the server seeing if they will trade still no luck.
---
Not only did I pay full price for the Tricentennial Edition I also bought the PA helmet edition.
---
Killing three starts and getting one star drops. Blows.
---
And did you buy 1st
---
Server stops responding vs blue screen of doom?
---
It's not my sub, there is no rule forbiding mentioning other subs especially ones that are directly related to 76.
---
I have read the rules, you should as well.
---
While I don't necessarily disagree, this gets a lot more complicated when refunds are denied and the consumer keeps on playing.  In this circumstance, it's like if a customer is dissatisfied with the burger and is *denied* a refund, so they choke the whole thing down.  Continuing to consume a product after your refund was denied doesn't retroactively invalidate that refund request.
---
It also gets more complicated when companies violate explicit promises or release unfinished products, which is where live-service games turn into a gigantic mess.  A lot of these products aren't good or fun at release, but players continue consuming under the expectation that things will get better.  The game might not be good now, but they want to be strong/leveled/geared for when it does get good.  Such players view their time spent not as value, but as an investment that'll pay off in the game's future.   If the game never gets good or promised content is never delivered on, that time spent is a failed investment.  So I guess a restaurant comparison would be:
---
The company promises "If you keep eating this burger long enough, it eventually gets delicious!  And we'll give you a bunch of free sides as you eat!"  But that never happens.  So you've got people who've finished their rancid burgers trying not to be sick wondering if they just wasted their money, time, and stomach space.
---
That doesnt put them in the same calibur of companies as Blizzard. 
---
Its like comparing AT&amp;T to Boost mobile or Cricket.
---
So why did you comment? Just to show how much money you wasted?
---
Should i drop tenderizer? Alot of what ill be doing will be pve for a while so i can get used to build as im coming from melee and im getting tired of power armor and melee.
---
First of all  Congratulations on your victory!
---
Believe it or not, Canada will support these same laws. The only issue is that in order to receive it, you would have had to file with in 6 months after purchase. 
---
I am waiting for a class action lawsuits to happen in the near future.   I have a few friends looking into it as we speak.
---
 As the saying goes, you fuck me once, you fuck me twice, the next one is on you, bitches. 
---
I honestly don't understand the thinking behind Bethesdas business practices. Like what are you thinking!?
---
People are just going to sit here and take it. Its bad enough that you have a compulsive liar as the head of your management team. 
---
Is it really worth the couple million dollars a year. To be out of a job in a couple of years, because everyone hates you, and your company goes out of business. I hope you enjoy working at Mc Bethesda, make me my burger and fries, Toddy Boy. 
---
What next the company name will change, the servers will stop working, not that already don't.
---
 Let me guess, you bought the servers off of kijji on sale from the nineteen 90's, or maybe you bought them at a  garage sale on the corner. 
---
And now you are fucked, and had to buy new ones to service Fallout 1st. To try and bring back the community that you keep fucking over with your bullshit antics. NPC'S will out in 2071, sorry we will talk to the bullshit team for you. 
---
I get it, Donald Trump is secretly the president of Bethesda, that is why this game is broken. Because there are quite a few resemblances. Let's make Appalachia great again. Vote for my closest friend, Toddy Boy Howard's. He is just as incompetent as I am. But listen, we will continue to keep fucking you, unless you pay more. And that is Okay. 
---
Anyway, enough of my after work rant. Once again Congratulations Australia for leading the way.  
---
I apologize for being so rude, and vulgar. I just needed to express my feelings, because my psychologist told me so. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
It's takes so long it's painful.
---
I’ve never been able to complete it due to getting  corrupted save files near the end of the game. Literally every time. No mods.
---
I made several attempts to get a refund in November, but was obviously denied. Do you know how I got about getting one now?
---
Did I say I didnt enjoy it? And how exactly is it a bad comparison? The pickles are the glitches, the lettuce is the server stability and the patty is the amount of content. Both thing you trust the creator to get right, both things you pay for quality and content. Your message reads as an ignorant fan boy looking to argue with people on the internet.
---
Tat? 
---
The edit did not help :D
---
Yeah so don't get it and your good.
---
Good luck with that. You are literally trying to set a precedent where companies cannot every change their mind or add new revenue sources to keep their products profitable. You are making a huge deal out of nothing, but you do you. Do you know why normal people do when a business makes a business decision they disagree with? Just stop using the product.
---
Who says we've been playing for this long? I got the game on release, tried to play but couldn't because shit was broken, then attempted to get a refund. Haven't played since.
---
Oh and dont forget the restuarant server says that they will put u in a private boot while you wait for your fixed foor to make up for it. But theres a monthly charge
---
Oh I haven't played and never will unless it goes F2P. But how can people justify that purchase when there are far better things to spend that money on
---
ESO did in fact launch as a sub to play game, until One Tamriel, which made the subscription optional.
---
i didn't got a costume yet t.t only pumpkins plans T.T (did it 4 times and failed like 3 on my own solo world lmao)
---
What makes me ignorant.. because I have my own opinion on it.. I'm not looking to argue.. it's all the hate defenders who are arguing I only said what I think.  And it had nothing to do with this here... I said j don't support what Bethesda is doing with the refunds... Seems that people don't even read the whole text immediately start answering when they see a good word about the game ..
---
I was just trying to add to the discussion dickhead.
---
You have to know how to legendary farm events. Project Paradise, Encryptid, and Scorched Earth all summon at least one guaranteed 3*, with possible spawns of more
---
I did west tec yesterday. There was five 3☆ Supies all crap gear but it was still 2 and 3☆. Good scrip.
---
I think you're focusing on the wrong thing. RNG just sucks they didn't change anything.
---
Haha! I’d have to use a specific old save to load into the game, then load my current progress, and do the same every time I wanted to load into a previous save (for dialogue reasons, etc). Needless to say it was a huge pain in the ass and way more game breaking than anything 76 can mildly annoy me with.
---
I had several mods that fixed various quest and performance bugs, but file corruption is still a huge issue for NV. Losing hours of progress is just a game feature.
---
I realize it may come as a surprise to many, but there are a lot of different perspectives on play, not all shared with your world view.
---
I'm not against PvP, I'm against toxic play in the game.  I have zero tolerance for players who think PvP rules give them an opportunity to be a jerk to other people -- it is toxic.  Children (either physically by age, or mentally by emotional maturity) often take online gameplay as a way to act-out in a seemingly anonymous manner.  While I really do feel bad that somebody has to play in a toxic manner like that, I just don't want them in a game with me. I don't have time nor patience to put up with that.
---
I also would like to use the workshops as building exploration areas -- but it's not worth it to me because of this toxic play.  I don't want to spend 3-hours playing around with building things only to have somebody come by and trash things before I have a chance to blueprint it.
---
Consider this.  If everybody was playing on the beach, and workshops were a way you could go build a sandcastle -- even spending hours doing it (they can be fun, and I have) -- it is totally understandable that the ocean will come in and mess with stuff (so an event of being attacked by creatures).  How should I feel when some "dude" comes along trying to measure the size of his member and stomps through things that I spent 3 hours building?  Should I be okay with it because the beach is an open area that everybody has the right to be on, or should I have an expectation that there is some decorum between civilized people.  
---
The flawed thinking that all the pro-PvP'ers are shouting any time I bring up something is that the Workshops are designed ONLY FOR PVP.  I realize that is some people's perspective.  But it's not everybody's.  And, amazingly enough, this is a living game that has a cool opportunity to change -- hopefully, following the player base interests.
---
So, when players realize that a world that is all PvP is a total joke, and then the majority of players stop playing it, the mode is removed (Survival).
---
I suspect the real reason some people shout down these suggestions is they are afraid the voice might be heard by Bethesda, and they will lose something that they like.  But that's the way this type of game works.  I realize it's not a democracy, but the voice of the population is a factor in things.
---
So I will keep speaking up, despite your childish mockery and derision shown above.
---
The heart of the challenge I have with PvP in Workshops boils down to there are really two 
---
 play styles, shoved into one box.  I want to go build and just have fun building, for the pure pleasure of it, with friends, or not.
---
I don't want to have to be thinking somebody might come attack at any moment, so I have to reset my character build-out to be PvP oriented just to go jack around building stuff in a workshop.
---
I've played PvP in many games, I've built video games -- one of my engines is still used within Sony -- I've designed paper games, written them (both for WoTC and Crafty), I understand game design probably more than most people in the game.  I think in fo76-adventure it's broken because the game is to easily min-maxed.  There is a reason they've stripped a lot of that stuff from Nuclear Winter.
---
In my opinion a well-balanced game is one where the game system itself does nothing to help nor hinder another player.  If you had two perfectly matched players, the conflict would never end.  This sounds boring, and it could be -- fortunately we are analog creatures, and we make mistakes.  But the game system itself should not create a huge variance between players.  Otherwise, it isn't PvP, it is Player+(min-maxed build) vs Player+(min-maxed build) -- and it's more about who has the right combo of legendaries and perk cards, than it has anything to do with player skill.  It's meaningless if a player has spent a thousand hours grinding, searching the forums and markets, to get that one wiz-bang legendary that lets them dominate.  That isn't skill.  That's just... sad.
---
I've yet to bump into anybody who likes to PvP in this game, and does it in public adventure servers that isn't just being a toxic antagonist. Every scenario I know of is when players are being dill-weeds, and they like the ego-stroke it gives them when they do it. But that's for a masochistic self-serving reason, not because the gameplay adds value to the game.
---
I'm not opposed to PvP, I'm opposed to toxic players who are empowered by the system to be toxic.
---
Honestly, I really would /love/ to play a workshop with full-on PvP, if all the players interested would be willing to some game balancing limitations.  All of the other mechanics aside, it just boils down to:
---
1. *Remove penalties for dying* -- having it charge caps and drop junk is just stupid.  Doing this outside of any engine changes means simply an accepted code between players.  Don't take somebody's junk.
---
2. *Give a notification period when going into PvP mode* so somebody has an opportunity to go "oh, ok, shifting out of building-stuff mode, and into fight mode, fine, give me a second..." and reshuffle perk cards, shift around gear, etc.
---
3. *Disallowed when there is an imbalance of power* (that's more for others doing it, I'm sick of seeing level 100+ a-holes attacking level 13 players in a workshop.  It's nothing other than immature bullying at that point).  Something like a players can't be more than 2x levels from the defending player's level, and some other valuation of Legendary combined power.
---
But hey, if it helps you feel better, go ahead and keep mocking me.
---
But, you dont have personal experience with the game, only regurgitated outdated news that youtubers brought up. So you really think anyone here cares about someone who hasnt played's opinion?
---
Good way to spend some time while waiting for hourly event to spawn.
---
I literally said in the post that destiny 2's pass is £10
---
If you buy a stolen iPhone, even though you didn’t steel it you still broke the law. 
---
I know this is just a video game but you are still conspiring on violations of the TOS. There may not be any consequence, just personally think it’s a little brazen to flaunt your stolen gear.
---
That’s been my experience with some other games that have premium currency in the past that if you signed up for the monthly sub you could get a lot more premium currency for the money but at a slow rate.
---
Equip a full set of Troubleshooter's armor and Blocker.
---
Ah, another added to the 'things requested since launch' list
---
Wow... destiny is £10. And there are others that cost more. What is your point? A Big Mac meal cost £10 last time I was in London (4 years ago)
---
I don't need personal experience with a game to know a bad deal when I see one.
---
I mean theres a double bug there, 1 is that it repeats on both quests, and 2 is that your on wave 4 of 3
---
Cool.  Are there pics somewhere comparing them?
---
People seem to be selling extras at the whitesprings train station.
---
The pumpkin House has the skeleton mask on the porch and witch hat on the shelf upstairs.
---
Also the skeleton outfit is at the North (something) lookout... Not too far from the pumpkin house
---
Too bad u on PC. I can craft them
---
I don’t Blame you. Personally I was doing nuclear winter matches working on that combat rifle skin. I don’t think I’ll be able to play enough for that skeleton outfit so I’m not going to bother.
---
Yes and you get more for £10 than you do for £13 on top of an initial purchase, also destiny 2 actually works and is free.
---
If you actually earned a minor in philosophy you'd know this doesn't constitute philosophy but common fucking sense.
---
I even linked you a rare example of someone being dumb enough to give consumers too much power and you still schluff it off because heaven forbid this goes out of the realm of *philosophy* into concrete facts and evidence.
---
And since gamers are always on about companies abusing them and ripping them off I'd say it's more than appropriate to bring up what happens if the pendulum swings just as hard the other way.
---
I'm not also not even the one who started this sub-topic. If you don't think this is the right sub for it tell the other guy.
---
Your really just discrediting negative feedback from actual players who are displeased by making posts like this.
---
Thank you for your information, it's very helpful. Very interesting, I can work with that! 👍🏻
---
Why is nobody talking about the atomz?!
---
Ok. Hey you are totally entitled to say at what point you think it would be valuable. I personally wouldn’t buy it either as it exists. Sorry, wasn’t trying to argue with you there.
---
Triple A titles, like Battlefield and Ark, habe had and still have servers that you pay for. Bethesda may have not polished them very well, but they are going to be improving them.
---
I don't know anything about wastelanders, besides generic Preston Garvey Settlers. If you really want to know u need to research for yourself my dude. For example you could investigate all the Todd Quotes here:   [https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/todd-howard-quotes](https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/todd-howard-quotes) 
---
The best one is still this:
---
 "All new rendering, lighting and landscape technology, it allows us to have sixteen times the detail, and even view distant weather systems across the map."
---
Maybe u will find more than me about the newest and biggest dlc they have ever done lol
---
I'm not gonna read all that beyond your three points, make a TL;DR dude.  
---
1) Death being meaningless takes out the risk in anything  
---
2) When you claima  workshop, it pops up telling you you'll be open to attack from others  
---
3) Bethesda has said that despite level, you will deal the same damage, level does not control damage, making gear important
---
*Turns on mic, blasts music through it.*
---
&gt;because you don't like the thing you bought.
---
Yeah, no. The product didn't work in the weeks after release. At that point we're entitled to a refund. Pretty simple consumer law, the ACCC is very clear on it.
---
Hey, I love that idea. That would be great. Would also clear up looking at my stash box. As long as the frame had no weight, also.
---
Umm vats doesn’t work on players in NW, only creatures.
---
I’ve already uninstalled. I wish I could do this in the states, I’d love my money back
---
Do they give refunds for a disapointing night out at the movies?   
---
Do they give refunds to dudes who whine and dine a chick and don't get a kiss at the end of the night?
---
Indulging in something that might be fun also brings a risk of being let down.  
---
Maybe I'm just old.  A bad game of pinball was just a bad game of pinball back when.  Gamers need to stop feeling "owed" because they bought a game.
---
Let's all remember that the quality of games has not scaled with the costs.  Ataris 2600's Adventure(1980) and Bethesda's Skyrim(2011l are basically the same game.   They cost nearly the same $$$ (that part gets even crazier when you factor in all sorts of math) at purchase.  I think we can all agree that Skyrim is way better than Adventure.  
---
We get so much more game these days...yet bitch like we are "owed" something .
---
Oh like they improved the game?
---
Funny how people post about constant crashing and bug
---
Great idea. 
---
For the time being try Frog Jars they used to show damage numbers when shot. I haven't shot one in a while so IDK if they still do.
---
Dude... you don’t play the game. Why are you here? Do you work for bungie or something? Lol
---
I don't stick up for Bethesda, I only jump in when either people are spreading hate or shouldn't be jumping in as they have no idea. That's still the case with you.
---
Thanks, and Yeah just the weight of the pieces would be nice.
---
Okay thanks for sharing.
---
They did, I and many other people arent having those issues, the vocal minority is always heard. And again, outdated info from youtubers is probably all you have
---
From what I can tell (with no actual knowledge other then my own observations in game) is that when they first spawn in, enemies have a certain level attached to them, after being killed or respawned by players entering an area thats when they start to scale to the players, so I could always tell when I was the first person at whitesprings for instance because the ghouls would all be super low level, then after a round of killing they'd all be level 60
---
&gt;Jesús.

&gt;
---
&gt;Fallout New Vegas literally offered you direct P2W advantages from pre ordering the game. You got a canteen (prevented dehydration) a grenade launcher (pretty OP to walk out of the tutorial with) and other goodies. 
---
Why are we discussing New Vegas? Or are you trying to argue that P2W, in a single player game, is somehow an example of how P2W doesn't apply to FO76?
---
&gt;Black Desert is buy to play. With an optional sub that gives increased carry weight, reduced fees from the auction house, and increases to exp gains. They also have flat carry weight you can straight up buy, as well as pets that loot faster, costumes that **hide your name and identifying titles**, and market items you can buy with real money and then sell for silver in game. 
---
Yes? What's your point? Are you trying to describe the line between P2W and not P2W that I asked you for? Because this is just a list of P2W examples.
---
&gt;It’s also arguably the most popular mmorpg on the market aside from WoW. Don’t take my word though. Go hit the steam charts. And the majority of players play straight through the game client, 
---
So? That loads of people are ok with them does not mean those aren't P2W purchases.
---
&gt;Pay 2 Win does require competitive aspects to be applicable. That’s what “winning” means. For you to win, someone has to lose. 
---
An interesting position to take for someone who began with the argument that New Vegas is P2W.
---
&gt;Again, **real** Pay to win implies there is some fucking way of winning. Because that would imply you get a **real advantage**. If you have more stash space than I do in 76, it’s not an **advantage**. It just **is**.
---
Extra stash *is* an advantage. As are repair kits, a fridge that mitigates game mechanics, and a robot that gathers crap on your behalf. 
---
&gt;You having more space than I do has **absolutely no impact** on my individual game experience. 
---
Neither does my water canteen in New Vegas.
---
&gt;If this was a full loot PvP game where I had a limited storage space but you had an infinite one because you subscribed, that would be an **advantage**.
---
Why? What advantage does being able to store infinite loot grant you as long as I can get the same loot?
---
&gt;The same would be said If this was a game where acquiring the most amount of caps was rewarded with special skins and titles. There would be competition for those titles and skins. 
---
&gt;Again, there is **zero** competition in 76. You cannot have winning without competition. 
---
There is a strong argument that you compete against the game when you have no real world opponents and that beating a single player game is considered winning.
---
Look, I'll skip right on by the fact that Fallout 76 **is** a multiplayer game, that **does in fact** have PvP, and that these purchases **do in fact** grant advantages. The simple fact is that you can spend more money to defeat or mitigate some aspect of the game. That is pay to win. It doesn't matter if millions of people don't care and play anyway, it doesn't matter if it doesn't autokill your opponents or unlock a platinum trophy. It doesn't even matter if it's unethical or not. 
---
You are moving the goal posts when you try to change the meaning of P2W from "paying for an in-game advantage" to "only if it's PvP except for some single player games and only if give at least this much advantage". That's the same bullshit BGS themselves pulled when they said "it's not P2W it's just convenience". Or "it'll only be cosmetics. Until it's not."
---
Shifting goal posts.
---
Other new multiplayers I've tried on the original Xb1 this year: Apex legends, PUBG (a game advertised as still in beta), RDR2 online, Sea of thieves, maybe some others that I'm not remembering. None of these other titles have given me anywhere near the amount of disconnects and server crashes as 76. 76 for me has a server crash about once every 3 hours when playing adventure mode. Nuclear winter seems to almost always work fine, and I rarely/never used the survival servers when they were up. I think the game engine for 76 is what needs to be updated, not my console.
---
What are you talking about lol? The buffed legendaries. Where have you been?
---
So you're sitting here saying nothing in 1st is of value when you haven't played the damn game (And never will as Bethesda doesn't do F2P AAA games)
---
1st is subject to change, you could be in the future getting a lot more.
---
It is fixed
---
That’s still RNG lol.
---
&gt; If you actually earned a minor in philosophy you'd know this doesn't constitute philosophy
---
It does. 
---
&gt;If you don't think this is the right sub for it tell the other guy.
---
I am. My comments are public. He can read them as well.
---
This , this is the kind of attitude that makes companies keep getting away with it ,   
---
"I know they keep screwing us guys but lets give them  more money , maybe that will turn things around!!"  
---
Personal I'm done with this company, they a care  a heck  lot more for money than with it's loyal customers and i'm done trowing my money at them hoping the'll do better next time, and maybe they should cut their losses and sell back the Fallout franchise to the original owners
---
"Could"
---
Absolutely worth it.
---
If someone sells you a car that's missing a wheel and is at the mechanic's every other week you have a right to take it back and claim your money back. Just because a game isn't as expensive as a car doesn't mean they can sell you a broken product.
---
Yet you know Destiny 2's price for subscription and that game is premium (unless you got it off steam)...Hmmm  
---
You called him a watermelon lol
---
It actually hurts man. I think many of us who are fans of Fallout wouldn't mind an optional subscription if the base game was actually  a complete and solid base, and the sub added to that and not to the detriment of the base game players. It's pretty frustrating as we don't want FO76 to fail, many of us want it to be a great game but seems BGS is actively trying to milk it dry before it dies a quick death.
---
If the person got the caps u can try messaging them if u even rememeber their name and see if they willing to give u the ammo u paid for.... Idk
---
I don't need personal experience with the khajiit to know that they are garbage when I see one.
---
Btw is there a guide somewhere that explains the icons and basic mechanics of outer worlds? It all seems pretty simple but I feel like I’m missing some obvious stuff. I have a feeling i will get to the end of the game and wearing some plebeian armor lol. I’m only a few hours in.
---
I really hope I'm reading your comment in the wrong context. But I don't really think that's possible. what the guy is saying is:
---
 "hey, I'm done playing Fallout 76. I'm going to log on one last time to give away all my shit for anybody who wants. Thanks for the good times &amp; people I met along the way, peace out"
---
I'm hoping you just didn't realize the context of what the dude was actually saying. Because in my heart of hearts I'd like to think that people aren't that big of actual fucking douche nozzles out there as to leave such a comment to somebody just trying to do something nice.
---
So I hope it's just a misunderstanding.
---
We justify it because despite what it lacks or breaks, it’s still a world we’ve grown to love over the years and to be able to experience it either alone or as a community is a pretty big deal, current story sucks and I can only hope Wastelanders delivers but the world still matters to people, it still makes a difference because it includes the people in its barren world to be as nosey or violent as they want to be, be it scavenger, merchant or roleplayer.
---
You forgetting to mention all the absolute gremlins that dont play or have never played that come here to complain about something they have no active part in just to add fuel to the fire
---
Just search destiny 2 free its not hard
---
Can you even one shot? I know it can go down fast but honestly. It spawns at some place every time. Just be ready.
---
Ok RDR2 has huge server issues, PUBG literally isn't optimized for the OG Xbox and runs on potato mode. All of these games run fine on the One X. It's literally PROVEN that RDR2 and PUBG run better on it. I don't know what you're arguing about lmao
---
This is a stupid post. It's not a controversy.
---
Is someone going to post this yet again??? This is like the 10th time already and the exact same link and story...
---
Not a controversy
---
Dude I rocked a level 10 bloodied pole hook all the way to level 50.
---
They said biggest for FO76. Not biggest they’ve ever done. Don’t set yourself up for disappointment like that. I wouldn’t expect anything the size of far harbor.
---
Cool, Destiny 2 otherwise is a premium game with a subscription...  
---
To your definition, you bungie fan, it is stupid.
---
I'd bet my teeth, there'll be more to 1st in the future, it's only just been released, jesus.
---
This guys one of them, thats why I blocked him, I agree with what he says for the most part with the subscription, but he is using outdated ass info about bugs and shit in the game
---
Hey sorry i stayed off of here for a few days. No no second server. 2 out of the 3 of us were memvers though. No event respawn. However if we would have finished the event on my server quickly and then jumped to his before the initual time had ran out then it would have spawned the event. Just like on a public server if noone starts the event. As for the event restarting over and over again all hour long that is nonsense. On any server.
---
1) Yes  
---
2)Yes  
---
3) Yes
---
Awesome this is the kinda information I was looking for. Great! Thanks
---
Yeah...a car is not a night out.  A broken video game also isn't a matter of life and limb.  But I hear ya.  
---
Is FO76 really broken or are people just cranky about it?  I played since the early beta up until I hit level 130 something.  Never saw it as broken.
---
Haven't any of you gone out for a night on the town with your friends?  One of those nights where you drink too much and the next day you regret the fact that you are down a good $100+.
---
Bugception
---
Cool good looking I will give that a shot. See ya in the waste.
---
What are you on about destiny 2 new light is on all platforms for free.
---
This post is in reference to that one, so the logical thing to do is to, you know, link it?
---
The service is selling, everyone bitches but they all bought it lol. I feel like I got my money's worth. I just hate they're not adding anything substantial to the game now. Even Halloween costumes.
---
I started typing it out as a joke but i stuck to it and i did think it was kind of ridiculous that the first turret skin was black, but ‘seasonal’ where the standard turret is that white/greyish idk its bizzare if anything but given the bizzare things this game charges for (1st Member, it....... should have left limitfree scrapboxes for all players and the survival tent? Would have been great in SURVIVAL)
---
Yeah, Filthy Casuals is going to remove bash posts.
---
But its no there now and right now your paying £13 a month for barely anything.
---
COmplaing about r/fo76FilthyCasuals removing bashing posts when it's their rule 1, what a troll.
---
I have probably less than 30 minutes, FWIW.
---
Link it underneath the post you are referencing then, instead you create a new post... you can also search it in the header and post it on each post... it’s pretty simple...
---
Bye Felicia.
---
See you in a week.
---
Where's the vid?
---
Half price in a month?  You could get it free with refurbished used controller 20 days after launch.  How much was the Tricentennial Version?  Oh, right ... the same cost as paying monthly for Fallout First for a YEAR.
---
More like 10% of release cost after a month.
---
They spam stories take a look at their profile...
---
Same on PC, goes down in seconds.
---
Are you fucking high? Or do you just have zero ability to recall past information?
---
****You brought up Fallout 2, a single player game, and referenced unlimited stimpacks saying that would be Pay 2 Win. I referenced FNV as a single player game that already did that and not a single person bitched about it.****
---
**You** asked for examples of a Korean game and attempted to strawman my argument by saying “since you didn’t mention anything specific”. I gave you the specifics, and I explicitly elaborated on how BDO has **real** Pay to win mechanics that **directly** effect game play. 
---
Having an increased stash limit gives **zero** advantage in PvP. If they were offering bloodied/explosive Gatling lasers on the atom shop or part of Fallout 1st, then yes it would be P2W. 
---
I’m not the one shifting the goal posts here, **you and all the hysteric reactors are**. P2W means exactly what it says, **pay to win**. Bethesda is offering an **optional** service that does not effect character stats, abilities, damage output, damage resistance, perk efficacy, or modality of the character. It exists **solely** as a series of QoL (quality of life improvements). 
---
And finally, the population of a game does mean something. **Especially** when yourself and thousands of others are wailing that what Bethesda has done is “killing” the game because it’s implementing P2W mechanics. 
---
This entire community, yourself included, has lost complete sight of what that phrase actually means and now just uses it as a buzzword when they don’t like something. 
---
It is embarrassing to see so many people cry over an optional, QoL service implemented in a cooperative, PvE game.
---
Spamming stories... is that all you do?
---
It's a different but related subject matter. If mods take an issue with this, they're more than welcome to removing it. 
---
Until then...
---
What platform?
---
Different but the same... you said it was in reference to... then it should have been a comment under the original...
---
I hve a Jeep at mine that you can shoot. I think they added something recently (noticed at whitespring) that it will show damage even after it has blown up.
---
Ehh, kind of a half-baked appreciation post. Why? Because the rewards for this event sucked. It would've been cool to get a samurai outfit or a gladiator outfit? Guess what, that's in the atom shop :3 
---
What about a candy bowl? Atomic shop. What about Halloween decorations that aren't stuff already in the game? Atom shop. What about the decorations they made for the event? None to be found. 
---
I'm a supporter of this game and even I, have played this event once because it's not worth my time
---
I find it utterly perplexing that devs don't force anticheat/antidupe/antiRMT measures hard. In any previous MP game I've played fighting the cheaters was usually a top priority;F76 is, well, not in that camp.
---
1) Perk cards are unique and perk loadouts are coming  
---
2) Code doesn't work that simplistically.  
---
2b) There's plenty of spaces we have already in the 76 map and bethesda isn't going to add older game locales to the new game  
---
3) Wastelanders is about rebuilding after the bombs, 76 is about players banding together and rebuilding. The only factions confirmed so far for Wastelanders are Raiders and the Settlers. You want Bethesda to readd Enclave (Confirmed dead), BoS (was busy in Cali at the same time as 76) and Institute (didn't exist) by timejumping to the time of the other fallout games despite this game being both a spin-off and a PREQUEL.  
---
4) You want a prequel game to timejump and have a resurrected Enclave (Confirmed dead in NV and 3), Institute that owns Boston (They tend to not canonize multiple endings or canonize all of them)  
---
Also no, Bethesda should never go back on their promise that all DLC type content is free just cause you're willing to pay.
---
Pc
---
#BlackTurretsMatter starts to trend...lol
---
You want bethesda to recycle new areas as a easier way to have new content instead of following the story established in 76?
---
Wastelanders currently have confirmed two big factions, the Raiders, and the Settlers, but the trailer hints at the return of the Mothman Cult.
---
Yesterday i got one for 100 caps from a vendor machine.
---
Why do people feel compelled to announce them leaving the game yet fail to show a video of them deleting their characters??? 
---
Video or it didn’t happen...lol
---
You want them to restart when they already stablished that A) 76 is a prequel, b) it's a spinoff.
---
Yea I would avoid tenderizer, it doesnt add very much damage and only lasts a few seconds, your better off with lone wanderer for AP regen so you can vats more. Or take points out of charisma for agility and luck.
---
I kinda glanced over stuff you were asking about and went on a tangent about how to min/max rifle builds. Sorry I'll try to address some of that here haha.
---
I don't use gunsmith or demo expert on any of my builds, my sneak rifleman can kill the queen easily so repair kits become abundant after a while. You will also be doing so much damage per shot that most enemies take 1 shot, so the gun lasts a long time. If you use stealth you never get hit, so you never have to repair armor. No use for white knight to stay equipped. 
---
When it comes time to repair guns and armor, I put on weapon artisan, repair weapons to 200%, then switch back to nerd rage. Same for armor, put on fix it good and white knight, then switch back. For most of my bloodied builds I run 3 intelligence and only run with nerd rage.

With my bloodied builds I dilute all my stimpaks, because theres only a sliver of health to heal. My sneak rifleman doesnt use stimpaks that much though, he's always in sneak so theres no use for them. I just sell or give them away and don't bother with traveling pharmacy, I'll keep around 20 diluted on me. I do use bandolier because he does chew through 5.56 and I need to carry a lot.
---
FYI the core game is now free
---
I think we should not try to complicate the coding any more than it already is. 
---
The Devs have too much on their plates right now with all the bugs they still need to fix
---
We have gone a year without cross platform, we can wait a little longer for a more stable environment first.
---
They aren't going tos tart over. You never start off just cause you get shit, you learn and fix it.  
---
You want Bethesda to restart 76 as both a mainline fallout game that canonizes Fallout 4, while also keeping the Enclave alive (Which is noncanonical), and a Sequel to Fallout 4, despite the fact that each Fallout sequel deals with a different area.
---
Cool.
---
Who said I was complaining?
---
Erm, I only have Gunsmith for modding or crafting.  I use full Weapon Artisan to repair up to 200%.  This allows me to go without Gunsmith, which frees up 3 slots for exploration.
---
To be fair Destiny 2 wasn't free at launch, they are just following a similar model used by Arena in GW2.
---
And if you get it for a year, Fallout 1st does only cost below 9 dollars a month.
---
A better example in this case might be RuneScape, it's even better because RuneScape isn't even a 3A game but being a member of RuneScape is so much better than getting Fallout 1st.
---
I just bought a Yeti mic for 80 bucks on Oct30 and it came with a free PC copy of FO76. The code expired Oct31. Glad to say I didn’t redeem it but still got a good deal on a microphone.  FO76’s shittiness saves me money inadvertently while finding a Yeti mic deal.
---
To you!
---
To you it's barely anything, and you're again bullshitting since you yourself said you never played the game.
---
Who are you to decide that defacto its not of value?
---
No prob, i cant garuntee thats how it does actually work but thats what it looks like happens to me
---
The thing is, Wastelanders is probably going to launch relatively bug free. Just think about it. They pushed it back and this is truly F76's second chance at being something, they arent just going to throw this out the window.
---
Also thats not how it works, its not like they have to do literally all of the work. Microsoft and Sony have already game devs the ability to basically open the flood gates. Obviously some work would be need to be done but just based on the extra time they get and the huge flow of revenue from Fallout 1st, its pretty safe to say they can do it.
---
How can anyone find value in a box that deletes your items and servers that aren't private
---
I wish. Just got those orange shorts today for the first time. Don’t really care about pirate but it would be cool.
---
I would prefer the scrapboxes be removed since bethesda isn't going to give them to everyone.  
---
You already had a camp, just needed to team up with people to be able to fast travel to 4 different camps.
---
Never said I was done playing...lol
---
I’m just going to see what outer worlds is all about. I still love the game, it’s just getting hard to keep putting hours into a buggy, glitched out game.
---
Check out the vendor CAMP sales. Now that Junkies is the the build trending, I see all kinds of stuff for the menstrual build crowd.
---
I wasn’t arguing, didn’t mean to come off that way.
---
So you’re not officially done?
---
I never said I was done playing, just expressing my frustration.
---
Your reductionist arguement doesn’t exactly make you right.
---
Damn, you’re good. I guess not.
---
Nothing better than sitting outside enjoying the sun, a swim and the Boxing Day and New Year tests across the Christmas and new year week.
---
You do know that Bethesda and Zenimax were in the same office and have the same employees at the very beginning, they never were partnered, they were just like twins birthed at the same place that stay together.
---
Give you an upvote :)
---
How are you comparing a game with bugs to a car with 3 wheels? That’s a pretty poor analogy. The game is playable, always was.
---
Yep. So let's say you play for your arbitrary limit before finding the game is broken (2 hours). You request a refund which you're entitled to under law. The company rejects the claim. What then? Most people would try and get at least some value from the $80-$100 they just spent (don't forget Aussie prices are higher than US prices). So those people who are lied to by the company should now be denied refunds?
---
Sorry buddy, but they wouldn't have played for those extra hours if the company had complied with the law in the first place and given them their refund.
---
Not every player reads Reddit.  The point being Bethesda has made no in-game announcement informing the general playerbase that the item is unintended.
---
Bethesda has not run a script to remove the item either.  
---
A message at the login screen would be insufficient as it would not be kept permanent, therefore players could miss it.
---
Your entire post.
---
That’s why we get free healthcare
---
They fixed the scrapbox, and they are working on fixing that for the servers.
---
I'll hand you that, sure, I did. Doesn't matter to me, because at the end of the day you're the one wasting money, and my attack on your character stands. Now, we are done.
---
So post was a drama piece you didn’t even mean... got it...
---
Gtfo
---
Don't you think they should fix the actual game before charging you money for more broken things
---
If you find out, let me know. I barely jump in there
---
Fuck Bethesda. I used to swear by them. Now . Fuck em.
---
Yeah I'm just gonna running around with noob gear. Struggling
---
This is not a game for those wanting a start to finish type game. This game has no, 'I'm the winner, I've won!' scenario ( Nuclear Winter mode aside) but, the world is huge and full of things to find and explore. The players for the most part are helpful and while the game isn't perfect I'm still having fun daily with the crew I've met playing.
---
i will lol
---
there were 4 of us and he downed all of us in 1 shot each
---
Christmas in summer sucks :( 
---
I don't really want to be around my family having a bbq in 30-40°c heat. I want to be chilling at my house with the air con blasting, watching movies or playing games.
---
Absolutely.
---
Actually the reductionist view was spot on in this case... imagine that...
---
No I can sit here with all the money i saved not buying a broken product and laugh at you idiots that still support said product with actual money
---
What system?
---
I live in that shit hole, and our polices are ass all around, I also been to the south, and I have seen these people...they are something.
---
If they are the same. . . Try the pumpkin house (forgot the name).  I found both there 2 weeks ago.  Not the plans though.
---
Definitely, companies or consumers, we're all people and people are susceptible to greed when given the chance. 
---
It was a pleasant discussion, it's nice having civil discourse instead of hostile arguments.
---
I’m sure you can Google image search Fasnacht masks and see each of them.
---
Don't youn think they are currently doing bugfixing and stuff on top of working on wastelanders?
---
A charged Assaultron Head with all of the buffs hits over 900 headshot. A scoped lever or corssbow with all of the buffs hits over 500. I one-shot a guy at sniper distance with an assaultron head.  I'll show video proof if you want.
---
The most revealing thing about FO76 haters is their refusal to believe that other people could have a different opinion than them.
---
(I mean, fuck, I say I like a game and I get 4 downvotes).
---
Not really. I clearly defined this Halloween atom shop debacle as one of many mounting issues with Bethesda’s behaviour. Reducing it to crying over Halloween items is not spot on at all. But carry on trying if you like.
---
It should never have been broken in the first place.
---
Its quite horrible
---
Lame
---
I will cheer you on, friend!
---
A lower starting price will always bring in more numbers than a large price. Remer the motto: "Its the small things that count".
---
But they wont make any money if they offer it too low. Why i picked 7.99 /mo as a suggested "MSRP".

---
Before you're downvoted into the floor, I feel ya. Be safe.
---
Well you claim your done in the original post so I guess it doesn’t matter any longer until you come back and rant again...lol
---
You just conceded the entire argument.
---
[s]Well played.[/s]
---
Let me guess PC?
---
The hacks and cheats on pc are bad and there are 3 months worth of video on youtube
---
I wouldn’t give you a down vote for being happy. Congratulations on getting your money back
---
Good bye have a good one
---
Safe travels.
---
Excellent! Where’s the video of you deleting your character and Bethesda account? 
---
Funny no one does this... go figure...lol
---
My Tricentennial was delivered late, I ended up buying a 2nd copy so I could play w/ all my friends. We all took off from work to play together. So I ended up w/ 2 copies of this grind house game. And like you my group of friends hasnt played in months.
---
But it isn't sold on just one platform. That's the hole in your logic. Now I agree, they should offer refunds within a set period, but after that set period, it should be on the consumer.
---
pc indeed
---
The big crock north west
---
They improved performance and server stability, for a while. Thing is, they kept adding little bits of content that made it worse over time, without fixing it, and now we are pretty much with the same bad performance and stability as we had a little time after release. So yeah, still crashes.
---
Also the new Halloween event takes place on one if the most laggy spots of the game (the Whitesprings) and you need to blow up several cars while playing it. Smart.
---
How do you demand a refund anyways?
---
I agree tbh. If they could give us all a round 1000lbs itd be a lot easier, also if perks could extend to stash somehow but that would probably cause nightmarish crashing if youre switching them uo all the time so maybe they just give us our wastelanders and like 1050 atoms each for xmas.
---
Thank you, Sir. You can find me on The Unreliable. 
---
Captain Hawthorne signing out.
---
Lmfao.  Thats genuinely funny that you believe that BS.
---
what makes it weird is that he 1 shotted all of us one after another
---
There is, but it’s an atom shop purchase
---
That’s not a toy crocodile that’s a location
---
I wrote 33 bug reports in October. Nine of them were pretty much this.
---
Hopefully this will wipe away the money Bethesda made from the Fallout 1st scam.
---
And now GameStop is trying to get bought 🤣
---
Safe travels until we meet in another platform...
---
That’s the problem my build is PvE PA where I can tank a lot of the damage, but none of that means dick when going against some people what’s the point when lil jimmy just one shots you
---
Yet to those of us that are now second class citizens it would be nice to actually have meaning instead of a straight up pay to win.
---
&gt; Despite the recent backlash this game has received, I’m excited to see what’s coming.
---
I find it hard to see the connection between the two clauses in that sentence.
---
"FO76 has been criticised"
---
"I'm excited to see what's coming"
---
How are these two thing linked?
---
Yeah man, unfortunately the problem on pc is wide spread. Ive seen a lot of these posts. Afaik BGS hasn't even mentioned it as an issue. Some of the videos on youtube are pretty ridiculous
---
Edit downvote arrows pushing you underground
---
I couldn’t agree more
---
Sometimes bugs slip past devs dude. Developers aren't inhuman robots that can't make a mistake.
---
You're fucking entitled tho, tell you what.
---
On the one hand, griefing people isn't ok. On the other hand
---
&gt; I used my money to but something that didn’t interfere with you at all.
---
Is a lie. Because by paying for features that should be free you ARE enabling, endorsing and actively supporting Bethesda in making the game worse for everyone. By paying for a feature that bethesda claimed was "technologically impossible to implement", just for them to turn around and add"Well unless you pay us for it of course", you are actively helping making the game worse for other people who spend their money on expecting a game that would at the very least keep the promises it initially made. Of course noone would expect a working game from Bethesda, but noone expected them to become THIS anti-consumer. And any consumer who supports this IS interfering with the others. 
---
So i do not endorse people griefing others over how they spend their money. But if i said i was feeling for you i'd be lieing.
---
Thumbs up as i sink
---
i guess they don't know how to add a proper anti cheat to creation engine
---
Either way great video I had a chuckle
---
I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but why post here? Wouldn't It make more sense to post about this in r/Fallout ?
---
&gt; it lacks some content but its being added
---
You don't see the problem of a full release from a AAA company to be lacking content? If it was an early access game at a lower price i'd be more forgiving, but that's not the case.
---
&gt; Bethesda didn't owe him money because he paid it by him self
---
He paid for a complete game with full content, not the incomplete buggy mess that we got.
---
Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right."
---
"Will it be possible to buy non-cosmetic items, say, a legendary minigun, with microtransactions?"

---
Private servers are paid features, Bethesdrone ;)
---
Isn't there a point at which you should be denied a refund because you basically used the product? What is to stop you from demanding a refund every time you finish a game? 
---
If we do not have fair limits on things, then I could play a game for hundreds of hours, and then demand a refund based on a single bug that I encountered. And pretty much every game has at least one big, somewhere.
---
I realize that's an extreme example, but that seems to be what people in this thread are advocating for.
---
Some people also want to use "Fun" as a measure of value. This is completely subjective. I can play hundreds of hours and claim to not have had any fun. Or even better, I can spend those hours farming resources, sell them for real world currency. I haven't had any fun, but I have received some value from the game. 
---
There are many ways this can be argued, and many ways different interpretations can be taken advantage of. All I'm saying is that there should be fair limits. If you played a game for 30+ hours, I'm sorry I think you got some value from that, and you shouldn't get a refund. 
---
The one exception I would make is in legal cases. Either if the law changed, or if a company is later forced to provide a refund after initially refusing one. I accept that if you are denied a refund and believe that you're not getting one, you may end up playing just to get some of your value out of it.
---
Honestly if you give your stuff away then I think they be done
---
Dude, I dislike the toxic fanbase, but bethesda would get shit on for banning people for being whineasses.  
---
Just ignore them and move on.
---
Not even that anymore, a few of us who (stupidly) tried subscribing the other night haven't even got access to our member benefits for 3 days now lol Keep getting the same runaround from support. Apparently they are inundated with customer service issues. They are even failing at taking money at this point.
---
Nice post for internet clout. If you uninstalled, no need to tell us or particpate in the 76 subreddit.
---
&gt;When a consumer has purchased a product that has a fault which amounts to a major failure
---
That's the point I don't understand, personally. Genuinely.
---
The game works for me. Did it not work for you?
---
Honestly it's so hard to imagine it being that hot on Christmas, here it's all snowy and there the fireplace going and sipping hot chocolate
---
Well arguably just not communicating at all is an improvement over every single word beeing a lie.
---
That's all i wanted friends. Be safe out there in the Appalachia.
---
Slip past?
---
Joseph Anderson has a video of only the bugs he found and that is 3 hours long. The didn't slip past they just ignored them.
---
And yes I am entitled. I expect to be provided with a functional product if I spend money on it.
---
You need to raise your standards
---
X for doubt
---
Captainoob made a video showing it not long ago. It’s a pc issue, but it pretty much breaks the game in their favor.
---
Just because one side of the door is built, doesn't make the other side any harder to build. 76 was built as a non-crossplatform game, it's too late now to change it.
---
I’ve done it around 15 times and I’ve got the pirate outfit once.
---
No, its not too late to change it. That makes literally no sense. 
---
What do you not understand?
---
Something similar happened with my Biv quest, I had 2 if them at the same time and they wouldn't complete, also my Queen of the hunt quest is broken, it goes blank and won't complete after inserting the sample.
---
As much as people complain about Bethesda being a crap company they are getting away with a lot. 
---
If you stood outside of a restaurant and said it was crappy and complained about the food but still kept coming in you would look like an idiot. Then you drag the news in and start getting everyone to blindly repeat what you said, that restaurant would ban you have you kicked out then apply some sort of legal measure to keep you from being an idiot. 
---
Game companies take a lot of crap from people who know little about business and even less about game design and development.
---
Thanks- good luck in space!
---
LOOK AT ME
---
Yeah, but I also understand that humans make mistakes and that bethesda is working on bugs and even went and delayed Wastelanders to next year to make sure it was ready to release. Ifd you wanted a functional product, then how comes you said you never played the game and won't till it's F2P, how do you know it's broken beyond youtube videos that are outdated?
---
They did already comment that they will look into that after they find out how to make the scrap box not delete your scrap anymore
---
They shot you dead in the face lol
---
I'm on xbox so idk how you guy identify cheaters. It's possible that it was just a good player with a sniper.
---
I would like to see this
---
They'd go broke if they offered refunds to ppl that want it.
---
Announcing departure... sorry but it’s really not needed and this is literally a game... 
---
Again, no one shows video of them deleting their characters or their Bethesda account... so no, I don’t believe them at all...
---
