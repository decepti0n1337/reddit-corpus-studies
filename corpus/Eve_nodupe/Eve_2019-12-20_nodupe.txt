We need more of these meetings. In ALL Alliances.

I have a CCP-Branded Monocle. It's freaking amazing.
---
I like data sites, especially scanning them for BPCs and high-tech materials. As far as i know they're the only source of ligature and zeugma faction analyser BPCs - couple them with high-tech regional buy orders and you can make a tidy profit on their manufacture.
---
The value of decrytors vary considerably on buy and sell orders meaning you get a little market play out of them, whereas relic site salvage is *more or less* flat value because the markets are saturated with orders. The same is true for datacores, to a lesser extent.
---
It seems like data sites are more about long term t2 invention - an industry known for it's potential high value, while relic sites are the rinse and repeat ISK/stockpile generators. Relics go hand in hand with rig manufacture, sure, but datasites let you multiply profits by upgrading those BPOs to t2 BPCs. Plus data sites often drop those highervalue precursor arifacts required in storyline manufacture :)

&gt; finding a fit that anyone can agree on
---
That's because everyone has their own favourite fit to go for. Who cares if it's a shitfit it it's your shit fit :P If it works it's ok.
---
&gt; works for me as it just doesn't seem to give out enough damage, or survive long enough.
---
That's rather strange. A domi shouldn't have trouble to run lvl 4s. The usual approach is to fit an MJD and snipe with sentries. Maybe share the fit you tried and say in which mission you had troubles. Sharing fits is usually better for you to learn about fitting than just get a fit spoonfed to you.
---
btw consider to place such questions in the "noquestionisstupid" thread in the future.
---
No one does group Pve in this game
---
Enemy of my enemy is my friend
---
There used to be shit like terran small arms and such.
---
There are a lot of larger new player friendly corps and alliances.  I recommend Googling each one you are interested in and seeing for yourself where you think you fit in best.  That being said check out Karmafleet.  We offer lots of free skill books and plans to get you going.  Free ships to fly around and loose, go back and get more!!!  Free ships to learn how to rat and make money.  Watch some of our videos, if interested apply as told on the website, do NOT do it through the  game itself.

Man this is just flat out impressive. We haven't killed a supercapital in ages.
---
EVE has a referral program. 1m SP to start out. Sometimes a GM will message you randomly and send gifts too.
---
Logi only show up in BRs if they whore on kills or die (they need to be on a killmail somewhere). I don't know what our exact comp was but we definitely had more than two lol; they were probably busy repping like gods instead of trying to get on kills.
---
&gt; They OWE it to ALL of us to document the changes to our game-play even if its a surprise change because we PAY for the game.
---
You got it wrong. They do whatever they want, and you pay if you like the product. You can complain but they don't owe you anything. Maybe with enough complaints they will listen.
---
You’re not alone my friend, I’ve had two since DT today as well.
---
INIT feeding? What is this, the onion? /s
---
Maybe transfer it to CCP, their domain sucks balls.
---
That's awesome man. I actually just left TEST and joined Brave, TEST was the shit, I just don't have as much time for playing anymore. Great group of pilots however. I'll miss PGL comms rage.
---
1.  What are your thoughts on training all the drone skills?  They just seem to be such a core part of the PvE meta, but I've noticed I don't have a few trained to level 5.  Which are "must haves" and "can waits"?   My goal is to do some Gila t4 and eventually t5 runs as well as get a Rattlesnake this week.  
---
2.  How do you balance all the possible options for armor in your low slots for PvE?  I've never known if more resists is best or armor plates are worth it.  Armor plates can be mutaplasmid rolled, as can Ancillary shield repair, so I think those seem wise to keep trying to make good rolls of.  I run some solo Emerging Conduits and have tried armor with a few ships for those.  Seems best so far to run Core-X type thermal/explosive hardeners.  Then the RAH (Reactive Armor Hardener) is a life saver as it kicks in. 
---
3.  I had never bothered with missions, but now that I am chilling in High Sec... are Level 4 missions worth the time it takes to grind up to them?  I never even finished my level 2 security missions back in the day.  I think I'm asking more if they are worth it from a learning, fun, and interesting perspective.  I'm sure solo isk can be found better elsewhere.  Sometimes I just get bored and want fresh content I can jump into between fleets.
---
I just sent him an in-game mail. :)

It's all about gallente with heavy blasters. Sit on them and melt

Sadly, no. I think I was sleeping when this shit went down.
---
I don't know of any non-scam wormhole rental programs. Groups will often sell a wormhole that they have no interest in using further, but the only defense I know of against getting scammed is to be in a group that the sellers respect. The very same people that scam "sell" a hole to a nullsec PVE player will legitimately sell the same hole (at a much lower rate) to another wormhole PVP player who wants to make some isk on the side.

I passed the N5Y yesterday found a lot Winter Co guys.
---
EVE is pretty but I'll stick my neck out and say Elite beats it out by more than a little. IMO.
---
I wanna go to every party and take my Drake.  I dont care what the FC says.
---
Volta... Continuing the tradition of never taking a fight they could actually loose. 
---
Your not looking for a fight, your gankers and have never been anything more. It's kinda sad.
---
They just need to add the faction materials to pirate ship manufacturing in quantities large enough to make them worth collecting from data sites, but not too large that they bottle neck production.
---
A lot of that is just market profit though; if you have to buy materials for below market value via buy orders, you can save time and just cut out the data sites altogether, buy the mats low and sell them high for the same profit margin.
---
Explo bots literally require no investment or real training time, and can get as much income as most other botted activities.
---
Unironically I don't see why they DON'T add a CAPTCHA to relic and data sites before you can begin hacking; it's one of the few places where it could be one of the few places where you could :lore reasons: in  some form of required password before you can begin, and would greatly help against the explo bot problem.
---
Who died?
---
Look how EVE have changed.       
---
I have Test/NC/PH/Goon/Init char ... and people only notice the one in the strongest group....
---
Big ticket items are not always expensive because they are rare. For example intact armor plates in relic sites are only uncommon. But all the armor rigs need them in high quantities. 
---
Pirate Faction modules are already not the most expensive for most items. And they get blown up in wrecks quite a bit. If the price dropped a little bit because the supply was going up because of t his change then people would use them a lot more creating more demand for them preventing the price from tanking (pending exact drop rate, if they were super common then obv it still would.)

About three fiddy.

better question: how are you supposed to run ship programs if you cant hand out prebuilt ships for roams, or have miners hand off ore to builders, and likewise builders to corps/alliances

Well from POV there are mainly two kinds of newbies. First of all is the rookies can do some self learning learn from others and want to try different things. Secondly some newbies keep asking same questions which can be found on different sites.
---
I think he's being humble here.
---
Adding instances to an open world game is just such a great idea.
---
Ok well, great top games list.
---
I already have (and i'm the only one) and I already do.

Got a bunch tonight, like 3x in 20 minutes. I've been good for a little while but it was pretty frustrating.

I've never tasted poon before, but I have tasted pennies. At least I have something to do this xmas eve
---
now you won EVE. congrats :)
---
because fighting is fun. I mean, everybody is looking for a fight and now, with test and panfam attacking sort, there is the opportunity for a lot of pew pew. 
---
Remember Gigx and co2, nobody liked them either but they always created content. Condi decided to "remove" co2 from the map, and what was the result? Everybody had fun on reddit for like a week or two and a few thousand more players went into the blue donut
---
TLDR; I like to help people who help themselves.
---
As the great General Iroh once said 
---
 Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.
---
&gt;"cave guys"
---
I giggled. Keep rolling, cave people! \^\^
---
Better idea - add BPC for those filaments.
---
In order to produce a filament you need to use a lot of liquid ozone, value depends on the number of people you can move.        
---
We could help to solve LO oversupply at the same time.
---
What I'm also a bittervet from helping newbies? I've ran or been part of various newbie corporations over the years. I've met two newbies who actually had the mental capacity and attitude to make it far. Helping those two acquire years of experience in months was one of the most satisfying things I've done in the game. Most newbies just ask stupid questions easily Googled, derp around for a bit, then eventually go inactive.
---
Oh boy, this old chestnut again huh?  Clearly you have no fucking idea what you are talking about so I'm going to set the record straight here.  If we are in legions then we will take fights against subcap response fleets every time.  When a massive super or titan blob gets dropped then obviously we will extract because it's impossible to fight that without a lot of capital support.  When numbers are low and Ikis are used, a significant subcap response will often force an extraction.  This has nothing to do with not wanting to fight and more to do with the fact that Ikis are not designed for fighting against subcaps.
---
These absolute hideous color gradient skins need to stop being the thing.  Whichever art guy is on this kick needs to stop snorting Ajax.  Worst part is you know they'll be 15+ dollars per skin, too.
---
RuneScape developers had the same idea.
---
I believe the current state of the RS community is direct result of that. It killed PvP and only brainless level grinders stayed.
---
Good to know that you didn't play any mobile mmo
---
Would probably be easier to list groups not backstabbed/sold out by Shart Dragon.  
---
Off the top of my head I can think of:
---
Ah iv been meme'd like 3-4 times daily I just assume everyone mentioning my super is an ass at this point. Sorry
---
Hilarious part is that long list he has is barely a year in the life of Shart Dragon.
---
between this, and "news articles" that have pop up ads that literally blur out the screen behind them, I've pretty much given up.
---
CCP is still dumping dev time into these wastes of space?
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Let me guess, loot goes to Corp? I.E some of those frozen corpses
---
That damn BO-LD, first they shoot Blue Freighters, then they kill Brave and now they're onto CCP Devs. All hail our new Camel overlords!!!

I use image editing software that came bundled with FrontPage 98. Like to this day. I just wanted you to know that there are people like you that appreciate holding on to classic things that still do their job.

No sarcasm, I truly love this.
---
More people need to try and kill them.
---
they were added in 2011.
---
I think they make the world feel a lot more lived in. Know that's a valid gripe about them but then it does also make it less predictable where resources can be found
---
But provi wasn't really that involved besides being the bait char...
---
Yes, I don't mind them too much. Was just surprised to find no ore at all. First system I checked has 11 belts, the second was 5 (kinda expected it to be empty). Next system had 22 belts, so there was some ore left.
---
I was like "EvE is meh!" until I had my first fleet warp. Stunning!
---
Thank you for your and everyone else's advice. I guess there's nothing to do and be patient. And hope I get back into EVE before my skill trainer runs out.
---
I've never been in or seen a fight with anything larger than a battlecruiser (battleship if you count rats).
---
If a player's Titan gets destroyed, will it actually leave a wreck like in the image? Or is that a landmark of some kind?
---
NPSI without at least basic comping of losses is screwed
---
I already did some skill extractions. I wasn't sure to sell them or use them on my new account's toon.
---
I had a friend I met (it's been years since I played, all the way back in World War Bee era) who I saw floating around in his Stork on nothing but shields. Not knowing how little that meant or what Tech levels were, I decided it would be funny to burst him. I knew I'd have a few seconds, and that I had enough DPS to pop myself pretty fast in my Corax. Got him down to about half health before he turned on his shield generators. Tried to run, but I got popped. He PMd me a bit later and asked if I wanted to hang out and learn the ropes. Even though I haven't played in a long time, I really enjoyed those months I was subbed.

Those "inactive client" settings are for when the game is running minimized, like if you are playing a few accounts at once.

You want the alert sound settings menu, which isn't in the settings window at all.

Make sure that you have an overview tab that doesn't filter anything. When you're paranoid about decloaking, switch to that tab.

I'm noticing a pattern here with all these recent Battle reports. 
---
INIT eating shit while GOTB who actually hold the sov form about 15 chars who are probably Sort multiboxing.
---
I thought that was only a cleanup for the now defunct Dust 519 names?
---
Salvagers do armor/hull damage bypassing shields, bonus damage to Minmatar ships, and if you get the killing blow you also get the salvage.
---
You can do it solo. beyond that, I'm not giving up trade secrets.
---
Honest answer? It's funny to see how worked up people get over reddit and the hurf and blurf that comes out of it.
---
I think you’re forgetting how hard gotg fed horde back then.
---
I've done something similar, and they helped me out. Knew the email tho. So all hope is not lost.
---
I'll take a Nova cannon that shoots across the system for 500 Alex!
---
Constellation is extremely powerful and specific.
---
For example, instead of a JF for supply runs, we can fill up 10 T1 industrials for like 400,000 M3, and yeet the fleet right into O-EIMK from Jita instantly. From there it's like 3 more jumps at most to get into staging.
---
The most specific you should be able to do is activity bands.
---
Didn't they just make the rocks smaller instead of actually removing them?
---
Neat. This should be fun.
---
So where is spud moving too if not in null?
---
they do this already.
---
store.eve.com points to there store.
---
Can you still get it from moons? @ccp
---
Spodbless
---
Hopefully the 40 people living there didn't put too much of a fight!
---
Unfortunately, they're kind of mediocre. The high/lowsec versions drop no loot from the rats themselves; the wrecks salvage as normal wrecks. You can get semi-decent drops from the FOB structures themselves, but the response fleets there scale *heavily* with player numbers while the loot does not, so you're better off doing them solo.
---
In terms of ISK/hr, even in highsec you're better off going and running Emerging Conduits alone - or better yet, getting into an Incursion fleet. Maybe it's different in Null, but I understand the favored tactic is to drive-by the Sotiyos with titans.

Yes, And Anoms

They literally only removed it from the one place People don't actually go to obtain it

Thera needs a buff tbh.

Love this

Thanks, PaladinOne this site is awesome.

That's just market oversaturation though. The supply of wormholers outstripped the demand from T3Cs. (Triglavian ships probably don't help either - a lot of people fly Drekavacs when they'd have flown a T3C before.) I've stopped salvaging sleeper wrecks because it's not worth it any more.
---
It's not only the Euros but also the Chinese and Russians. Suppose this Hypothetical 100% respawn time nerf goes in. The respawn for a Colossal/Enormous/Ice belt goes up to 10 hours from 5. Beijing TZ starts right after downtime, so the Chinese have their pick of anoms, then it goes into RUTZ, then EUTZ. When the Americans start logging into USTZ, stuff that the Chinese used hasn't respawned yet, and probably starts respawning around when US West Coast TZ starts, which means late Euros/US East Coast gets to have sloppy seconds from whatever the Chinese/Russians/Eastern Euros didn't want.
---
The correct thing to do is greatly cut down on both the amount in an anom and the respawn time. So every TZ gets at least some fresh material.
---
Jo\_Messier, Thanks for the link.
---
Is there a resource for finding out how much reduction in ved/spod mined has occurred from this and the anom reductions? I know we have the EVE api but it's a bit hard to get into.
---
but will then just revert them
---
&gt; *It is also understood that certain changes require precise communication in advance in order to give pilots enough time to prepare, so other more gradual plans that exist for changes will be communicated in this fashion.*

---
I DECLARE VICTORY!
---
well there is the fact a bs is  2 mill bounty,  but no loot an some  salvage.
---
This won't do much because a.) they still respawn after a few hours, and b.) moon fracks give plenty of regular ore, and right now tons of it rots in space because nobody mines it.
---
It will probably make mercoxit go up though, since that gets cherry-picked out of anoms and doesn't spawn from moons.
---
Is it a blessing, I like the big rocks because it means not having to move my rorq for a long time.
---
&gt; TIL that there are still asteroid belts in null.
---
Trying to do "kill 5 NPCs" dailies would be pretty hillarious without belts. Sure, my main can crush anoms; but my pi/mining alt? Just has no business entering a null anom.
---
it mite be worth it as a small fleet for null as  there's  normally  5 bs's  and each one has  2-3 mill bounty's then the salvage.  but i never salvaged and looted them when i try (was using  a super to kill the fleet then just kill the hauler for its loot. )
---
Let a fucking war happen jesus christ
---
The answer is probably manually piloting.
---
Ask your mom, she'll confirm that I harden up pretty good.
---
How to you align that to the system's IHUB upgrades for mining anoms?
---
I'm surprised you haven't blocked me yet like the rest of your sisters.

So nullsec will become even more barren? Who benefits from that?
---
These resource distribution changes are fantastic though
---
It's pretty big adjustments and is going to cause mass rorqual multiboxers to scale back. Plus they said that more is coming so honestly I'm happy.
---
The Hive must feed
---
Because endless isk / resources has led to super / Titan proliferation that has to be curbed if, that is, people are still interested in brawls rather shooting undefended tz tanked citadels. 
---
Also, as for logic - not everyone who rats or mines is a carebear, there’s plenty of null players who only engage in pve to fund their pvp. 
---
And yea I do believe people will pvp more of resources are scarce, it worked in the past...
---
J-space moons are high sec moons, so r4s.
