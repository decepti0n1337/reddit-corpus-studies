---
---
wow what a loss
---
Imagine losing two vanquishers
---
I plead the fif
---
haha ofc
---
I mean, if you need reddit to justify your existence, pat you on the back, and coach you with what to do for fun, then i dunno bud, you probably did lick it after all.
---
We'll take the time and destroy TCUs and ihubs. Entosis parties.
---
Kill Rights expire after 30 days.
---
Only thing is he was not in a huge battle. He tried to cyno in to a gate to take a shortcut to where they where staging. No, wait he could have asked/told someone and jumped to IAS or to O3- from TYB.
---
I was on the fleet that killed him.  I didn’t think to take a screenshot though. Wish I had now lol
---
It was in Chinese so no it wasn’t too long.
---
I mean, that wasn't my intention so if that's how you read it more power to you brother. 
---

---
I would assume they feel bad/lose moral due to basic things like empathy, concern, a regard for things outside of self. When shitty things happen to people on your team sometimes it's a bummer. I dunno what to tell you man.
---
Not even joking. You put a bounty on someone as a joke. Then you get notifications when they die to make fun of them.
---
You tipped your shit post hand at "perfect information".
---
It was a joke in reply to the sarcasm, whatever
---
Lots of people used to drop Corp before big losses to not affect kill.
---
yes, if you paid an irrelevant amount for your irrelevant super, it may have, at some point, approached 30b.  Maybe.  Ignoring drone mining.
---
True, that's is why I ask a question rather than assume I KNOW. Sure I start with an idea (maybe a bias) but if a well reasoned answer comes I listen.
---
You literally don't know what you are talking about.
---
I understand this reasoning. With MMOs I look at the end game as soon as I begin to like a game. If it's not balanced or a Trainwreck I know I'm wasting my time. Sadly Eve seems to be both, I hope I'm wrong.
---
Does this timer also work if you are trying to warp while stuck in parts of a citadel?
---
Good flair bait, all things considered.
---
Makes sense. I'm all for 'delayed' but more thought out updates.
---
And thank you to the person who posted a pic the other day of your overview and all WH's, I gured out where I was and what I was currently in and saved myself hours! lol

---
anyone played the alpha? worth dropping coin on?
---
Spore? Did we play the same game :P
---
If you mod it the space stage is pretty fun  waay less ecodisasters and a ton more items :)
---
I really just played it in it's hype-fueled early days. had no idea  it was modable and still going.
---
not if you have to ping for a fleet first :P
---
Stop being so gay.
---
It is the same guy too.
---
Vigils cant win this battle ..... ;)
---
yeah.
---
I mean when’s you don’t have much time to play it’s something easy to do. I don’t see the issue.
---
You adapted. I'm proud of you, krab, and will enjoy hunting you knowing you've competent defense tactics.
---
You'll have to forgive the sub, they're going through a 'we've always been at war with eastasia' moment
---
Neocom is better anyway
---
it is but a few members from there are not for example that shitty spammer.... who doesn't use proper doctrines ships and is a kinda officer please give me a break hahahaha.
---
Yes
---
Really now, literally you say? Do I literally not know a thing? Do you literally even know how to use this word, literally?
---
Bitch, please.
---
Sounds like a personal problem.
---
You cant run an alpha alongside an Omega
---
It’s not uncommon to bump for 15+ minutes to wait for criminal timer of previous gank, ping for a fleet, whatever
---
absolutely. I was just pointing out how absurd the current situation is
---
hi, enjoy! 
---
the slasher pilot was very good at intercepting by predicting.
---
you can have people cycle through being the sacrificial corvette t1 point and then log back into their omega to keep ganking.
---
yeah lol try ganking with multiboxed alphas and see how long it takes ccp to ban your ass
---
Your point?
---
my burn jita alts are all on omega accounts, its only takes a few hours to train up a burn jita alt to decent skills and then you can ignore the alpha requirements because they don't apply
---
Or just make it more effective to be solo. 26,000 players joined goons because its the most impactful and effective thing they could do
---
triggered much?
---
I mean is CCP really tracking if you're running a VM? Or if you have a second computer on the same desk?
---
So don't, if the person tackling last really needs their main on the km too, 3 mins is plenty of time to close the Alpha, log in main, and warp a frigate to the gate.
---
they can say they, but given how many times CCP insists "the logs, they show nothing"  I wouldn't count on it.
---
Sort said it is all fine that´s the msg are highest director´s said just today on the ceo channel "everythig is fine we are recruiting more bots"
---
He wants to bitch because he's mad, but he knows people will take the piss, so he's going to pretend the people that killed him are somehow bad at the game because they killed him in order to feel better.
---
In high-sec it's pretty much a dead profession. I used to do it too. Unfortunately it is exceedingly rare to find a worthwhile POS that hasn't been cleaned up yet.
---
In wormholes you can still do it (if you can find any), and null-sec still has the *very occasional* offline POS with an X-L SMA.
---
I dont understand why people downvote you. It’s 2019, nobody gives a crap about some dumb other dude in alliance losing a titan
---
Its just that they still hold on to their KB stats like a badge of honor, despite them just being a number. They think its a testament to their skill, or dedication, or experience or something. Its just pride.
---
No problem, I thought you meant there was a to see ship names on ZKill
---
It has about the same ehp as a normal levi.
---
While not wrong, you can just suicide alpha corvettes to point and reset timer
---
‘Vanq liquidity’?
---
yeah i'm freaking the fuck out about bumping chan-... oh n/m that's you
---
settle down it's fine
---
I am in test but as far as I am concerned xix and their botters can just as much suck a d***, ie unblue them, same goes for our renters
---
I would say that this sort of setup would be good for structure grinding where your going to be stuck shooting it for extended periods. Against other ships it's very unlikely that the target will last long enough for the longer spool up time to 'catch up' before the target dies or manages some ECM/Range shenanigans
---
Would that be an EULA violation?  Training warp disruption 1 on 10 alphas and logging them off 500km from Perimeter gate. then one at a time log in, join fleet, warp to bumper, suicide tackle, close client, wait 2 min, repeat with next alpha? I remember something came up about staging catalysts on grid or the like but this seems to me like it would be legit?
---
Come to think of it, would training 20 alpha clone catalysts and logging/using them in one at a time with bumps to keep the target tackled be legit?
---
very rich man
---
Judging by location, I think he either gated it or was baited (this ship died just before him in the same system https://zkillboard.com/kill/78690990/ )
---
This isnt much of a morale boost, its just shooting a skilless dumbo and as such doesnt give much sense of accomplishment.
---
well, now your end-game hisec shenanigans are more challenging
---
progress marches on
---
I can see plenty of my friends giving the game a try again if they just make the UI feel less scary and intimidating.
---
I don't really understand why it's so scary, but that's the feedback I've gotten.
---
&gt;it's not like they need to be logged in at once
---
Who said anything about multiboxing? You have 3 mins to log out, log the next one in and tackle.
---
Once again you don't know what you are talking about.
---
These are known as "drifter" wornholes. In k-space they show up as "Unidentified Wormhole" in the overview. They are C2 Wolf rayet effects, and have a massive amount of nullsec statics. however, when you warp to one, you land 85km from the actual wormhole. And drifters do roam their wormholes, and will nuke you if they find you. The only safe spot in a drifter wormhole is a deep safe, or the Sisters of Eve Flotilla. Its also a shattered wormhole, so no structures. No exploration sites in them, but there is a special PvE site in them that grants material needed to make the Antipharmakon boosters.
---
Oh and there are 5 of them.
---
why release any skin for the erebus that isn't a police pursuit?
---
No, I think I'm pretty spot on and the people I know who gank as thier primary activity aren't worried at all. I don't really know what you're on about except that you are upset, and don't really care. 
---
Once again, bitch please. It's fine.
---
Yeah, that's the cited reason for the change.
---
He is cornering the market.

---
Get those HIC cyno kills why you can.
---
Actually lasers are in a really good place right now. I'm Skilling into amarr myself from missiles and rails. Plus they look really cool.
---
&gt; I should start out by saying that, while I enjoy reading the increasingly hostile banter on this sub about the "age of chaos," the changes have had absolutely zero impact on my own play time.
---
I will say that WoW Classic has a significantly bigger impact on online players in my space then age of Chaos. It has been a REAL quiet week.
---
Are you really that narrow minded?
---
/u/CCP is the controlling body of the game. What they do implicate directly effects everything.
---
You analogy of "Gun manufacturer" would equate to another play building a ship. They have no liability after the product has been sold. That falls on what the current owner does with said item.
---
The "put into jail" would either be concord/player as they defend themselves all based on what /u/uCCP has designed for the game.
---
Because then he'd find out it's not as simple as nullbears think it is.
---
Been off eve for over a year or so...this might be the post that makes me get back on and undock. Fly safe!
---
hahahahaha
---
No, I'm not going to do that. The owners have done nothing to warrant it.
---

I've wondered before about how much of a discount they'd cut you if for whatever reason you wanted to spend 5+ figures on PLEX.
---
What does the booster do?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoFIzKyMmZQ
---
Man, I feel bad about not having enough losses. It shows I'm a lazy piece of shit to everyone out there
---
&gt; Core game was ruined by CCP investing everything into nullsec and big battles. CCP Thoughts that is what drove the game and let them shit on everyone elses play style. WH been fucked over, LS been fucked over, HS been fucked over (unless youre a carebear) and null sec was giving everything to become ridiculously wealthy and safe with little risk.
---
Best reply and why I left EVE.  Was fun while it lasted tho. :)
---
There are 5 Antipharmakon boosters. They give 8% bonus to shield boost amount, armor rep amount, capacitor, tracking speed, or missile range. With no drawbacks. They currently go for about 20 mil apiece. they used to me super cheap, as they were a part of an event where they dropped like candy. Since that event ended, the only way to get new ones is by running the sites in drifter wormholes.
---
Eve is what some people would call a "sandbox" meaning you can build and play how you want. Telling someone they're not playing or having fun correctly in a "sandbox" is what some people would call silly.
---
How do you keep the main logged and bumping? you need two persons for that, login an alpha and an Omega in two computers or a VM is still against the EULA.

And given Hilmar's increasingly erratic changes and his sudden decision to get involved in a game he has ignored for over a decade just 10 months before his big payday makes it seem likely they aren't going to meet some or all of those goals.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
can someone explain to me the whole 3 2 1 kenshin deal? is it their dumbass slogan or some shit
---
hilmar didn't capture shit in a bottle. The original dev team did, then hilmar came along years later and started treating the game like a money tree to fund his other projects, all of which failed to one degree or another. Now he's trying to "fix" a game he barely plays and does not understand by making large sweeping changes based on a very small very vocal reddit community that makes up an incredibly tiny part of the games population because he things that is the magic bullet that will get him paid in October.
---
Wish I could commit to Rust. The dozen or so times I've played I always come back the next day raided.
---
Hilmar and falcon have both said more or less exactly that in the past few months.
---
Pretty much my thoughts. Vegas is already a stretch, SD is a firm nope, and seems like nothing on the cards for our side.
---
Seems based on my runs that in cruiser sites there is a lot more ISK in the caches. Drop a MTU at the gate, use missiles to blow them up.
---
when flying a gila lress F to pay respect
---
I agree, your original comment is just... very difficult to read.
---
Yeah kinda annoying and also there are no cruisers seeded on the market from what I can find!
---
&gt;Yeah, right, all those two year veterans who injected into supers.
---
been around since 2009, can confirm they are shitting up the game in hopes of short term profits to get them paid in november. Just wait and see, the day the bonus window closes hilmar goes right back to not giving a fuck about Eve. He's even gone so far as to invest in his next gaming company already, the guy has checked out he's just waiting for his check to be cut before he leaves/gets the boot.
---
For the purposes of ruining Burn Jita, a second person playing bumps shouldn't be a problem. 
---
For my hypothetical, assuming there were two people, one in a constantly logged in bump mach, one cycling alpha catties, I don't think that would be against the rules, I feel like it maybe should be though.

If pl and test went to war tomorrow what advantage would PL have? like literally none as far as I can tell. (supers/titans Test wins, Player count test wins etc).

Link lossmail

I figured a lot of that, but it's cool to always learn, like I definitely was confused like I had my bookmarks wrong as I was looking for a HS path. I wonder if in the future there will be some content in there as in fighting the drifters to keep them at bay. Thank you for the explanation though I definitely appreciate it.
---
Fun fact, these music files are still in the game.  Per ccp fozzie at eve north.  They actively choose not to make a player anymore because third party was around.
---
at 20 mil a piece how hard are the sites? are we talking rattle status or dread status... lol
---
Everyone loves a good graph yes? This is Spreadsheet Simulator after all. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/TUjQZJB) is a comparison of the damage ramp of a base Entropic Disintegrator, and one with the implants in. With the implants, it takes 7 cycles extra to reach 150% damage bonus to match the base gun. It doesn't reach max spool until 67/68 cycles (I think pyfa is missing a few decimal places that make it land on the right final multiplier). with 3 T2 rad sinks, the rate of fire of the supratidal gun is 3.72 seconds. This means it takes an extra 26 seconds to match dps, and a total of 252 seconds to reach max spool. For the T2 trig ships this will be even longer.
---
To match total damage output takes a bit longer than to match dps as well. Total damage output is matched at cycle 54, or 90 seconds of spool time beyond base mod max spool. 
---
td,dr; If you make it less than 37 cycles you will not have more DPS than base mod, and if you make it less than 54 cycles, you will have less total damage output than base mod.
---
Potato graphics.
---
Well its middle of the night EU and late night/early evening on a thursday in US. I don't expect 20k people at this hour lol do you?
---
Not to mention WoW Classic just came out... A lot of people are reliving their teenage years right about now...
---
Yes, it goes up and down, even when just aligning. It seems to be an indicator of how close you are to alignment based on your current rate of progress.
---
Well you can't get a dread in here, so at the very least not that
---
Try OMIST
---
Many deathstar poses with supers and more in XL bays.
---
One suicide scram away from resetting the timer.
---
This doesn't change warping, it just gives a better indicator as to how close you are to warp.
---
1.) can't get dreads in, its a C2 and you can't anchor strucutres to make one. 2.) the sites are not terribly hard, but a drifter can roll into them randomly, in which case whatever ship they decide to shoot just dies (its a Tyrranos drifter), so when they are run, which is rarely, its with ships like T3Ds.
---
Imo asset safety will be changing I mean theres just too many structures and itll eventually muck things up with the servers the same way all the supers parked in Pos bubbles did. They will prob make some change to make killing some structures easier.
---
um... How?
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/i3q1r9F.png](https://i.imgur.com/i3q1r9F.png) 
---
It translate into "Come drop more Dreads TEST grandsons"
---
citadels and CCP killed many playstyles over the years
---
In space there is no up?
---
Might be bait, I do not think any professionally written document will refer to any place where players might congregate as a "cesspool"
---
But I fucking agree with that point 3 being there. 
---
The tutorial should say "Don't go to r/eve u less you want quit eve immediately,"
---
There was content with drifters and keeping them at bay in the past. It was knows a "Drifter Incursion", and was funded by the Amarr empire. Unfortunately CCP did a bad in making the sites and there was ways to exploit it. Namely, it was found that a gnosis could perma tank the drifters in the sites, while the sites were run with throw away thrashers. And there was no fleet member payout cap. so my friend, Morathia, organized the mass running of the sites packed with as many alts as you could to get payout. I believe on the numbers I crunched the group as a whole was earning like trillions of isk a DAY. CCP had to straight-up remove them before Amarr LP (which was part of the payout) completely crashed in value. It has not come back since. 
---
Also, here is the proof for the perma-tank gnosis https://zkillboard.com/kill/52538573/ over 6 MILLION damage taken.
---
If you want more drifter lore, check out Empress Jamyl Sarum, the Amarrian princess who was ambushed and killed in her titan in highsec by a massive drifter fleet (NPC event).
---
Aussie dread pilot spotted!
---
I wish they would. I’ve seen a few that deserve to be on zkill lol

And nothing of value was lost.
---
DAMM HOED you comment on alot of porn...
---
🦊 will not be pleased
---
1. I haz the dumb. PLease forgive me, I live in a C1 you think I would pay attention to mass restrictions. 2. Tyrranos is an asshoe. 3. I always love wolf rayets as a C13, with a couple friends. It'd be a fun experience though I'm not prepared for it now. 
---
Thanks again!
---
I don't know what you're talking about, I participate in mining fleets fairly often (about 3-4 a week depending on schedule) with two toons in barges and I make a very solid income just that way. Moon mining is best to be sure but even just spod/gneiss is enough to keep me afloat alongside things like explo and PI. If I'm doing something like an R32 moon with porp boosts I can usually make about 200-300m in a couple hours. Now I admit my krab skills are pretty high but even if they were lower (T1 strip miners, miner drone 1s, etc.) I've simulated proc fits that still make about 50m an hour which is very serviceable.
---
As for isk printing via ratting, I never mentioned ratting at all so I don't know why you're bringing it up here. Is isk inflation an issue? Yes, you're talking to a player who was around when PLEX was sold as a single unit and only cost like 800 mil. But it's also stabilizing, if you hadn't noticed. Part of it is blackout but the rate of growth has levelled off recently and at least to me it looks like it's going to start holding steady for a time. 
---
If I'm wrong I'm wrong but you can't blame spodbrains for isk printing because you're right that the credit for that goes to the botters. Who I never mentioned.
---
Problem with that is when you both you want to hit damage cap. No one want to wait 4 minutes to do so.
---
The dumb freighters will think they are safe, so I think you'll be okay. Seems to be no shortage.
---
Worst case, J Kusion just waits out his 15 minute timer before warping at zero to a target, and that seems to work okay for him. It just means having gate guns more often, due to no bumps.
---
noob question. do HICs have enough efhp to catch reps from FAXs under titan/dread fire?
---
You would be surprised. Also you would have 20+ of these in a bashing fleet so cap isn’t going to be hard to hit.
---
Also if your hitting something big like a fort or above, it will be defended so you will have support present also to handle them and they can also assist with initial damage cap whilst waiting for defenders to engage or lulls in combat due to repositioning etc
---
I will. I've also got all of the books I can find used or new saved in my amazon cart for a future 'rainy day' this winter. Been playing since 2003 and literally know none of the lore, but I've always been super interested. I wouldn't be a true procrastinator if I couldn't put things off for 16 years
---
The first nyx died in low-sec before hictors even existed. They kept it bumped to prevent a warp out, and neuted long enough to prevent cyno out.
---
It was a good night for hunting in the South
---
That's true of Reddit in general. 
---
Reading the subreddit for basically any game would lead you to believe that it is actually some form of experiment in human tolerance for suffering, rather than a video game.
---
At least in THIS case, Reddit is honest...
---
The single leshak gun also takes less cap than 2/8 Abaddon Pulse Lasers
---
And there is no one to hear you scream.
---
Run it off a cell phone hot spot - cell phones all go through NAT before they hit the internet, and afaik there's no good way to isolate individual clients behind that from CCPs perspective, and you can't just go and arbitrarily block all cell networks. And that's not even going the route of a VPN.
---
Aye, but you'll fall asleep before it spools up )
---
Brag bait best bait?
---
If you're already running a VM to circumvent the rules thought you might as well just use a VPN too.
---
UPDATE: ITS AT 14,090 NOW, EVE CONFIRMED DEAD
---
VPNs are probably easier to block without pissing off random people, but yeah, it's trivial that route too
---
&gt; What was the battleship obsoleted by in your own example? Another CAPITAL SHIP lol the carrier. 
---
Ignoring for a moment that the Prince of Wales was sunk by *land-based bombers*, or that EVE Frigates are supersonic aircraft and not naval Frigates, let's move on to a more important point...
---
[Carriers weren't capital ships until 1942, when everyone on earth realized that battleships sucked dick and carriers ruled.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_ship#Aircraft_carrier) 
---
WW2 Carriers were literally the same weight class as *cruisers*. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wasp_(CV-7)) is the carrier USS Wasp, at 14,700 tons. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Baltimore_(CA-68\)) is the cruiser USS Baltimore, at 14,400 tons.
---
&gt;Not a row boat, a carrier. 
---
OK then, Here's an [Italian Dreadnought sunk by a motor torpedo boat.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Szent_Istv%C3%A1n) A ship class so small, it *isn't even a frigate*.
---
Here's the [HMS Royal Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Royal_Oak_(08\)), sunk by a [60-meter long boat with a total displacement of 700 tons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-47_(1938\)). [HMS Barham suffered a similar fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Barham_(04\)#Sinking) at the hands of a [similarly small ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-331).
---
&gt;In conclusion, and I’m glad we both agree, capital ships should be balanced against other capital ships, not frigates.
---
Do you Churchill was busy writing angry balance posts about how his big capital ships couldn't be sunk by little German U-boats? 
---
[Real life has many features that may upset capital ship captains.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_13_missile_launcher)
---
Make it so only faction titans can keep cynos.
---
I believe they can be run in T1.5 cruisers, but that's second hand info.
---
they can't just go blocking VPN's because a lot of their european customers need them to connect in the first place because of ISP issues.
---
Undock, fight create content instead of shit posting grandpa.

It's because all of the bots run on solar power.
---
Are control towers still a thing? Can I set one up and use it as a safe spot and drop a mobile depot? How can I utilize the one I have?
---
&gt; Adapt or die nerd
---
Unfortunately for all of us, this type of immature perspective leads to a game dying.
---
&gt; Except with periodic blackout people will simply not go out during that time.
---
It's been happening for years and they do.
---
Very low number of players. I still love eve online.
---
&gt; Blackout failed because CCP didn’t turn off the lights completely and tear up the maps and force players to link systems on their own with the new gate system.
---
It failed because there's a lack of prey. The idea was to increase the risk, but there was no subsequent balancing of rewards. In short, the prey is gone and all of you have is empty space.
---
Seriously, not enough people understand this.
---
# This is a tarp...
---
If I could give some constructive criticism- If you're making a "basics" video, I feel like you should be explaining what you're doing a why in the video. Without that I feel that there's very little for a newer player to learn from watching this video.
---
Why kick someone for playing a game and risking a ship and giving hundreds of other people a fun time?  Killboard stats are taken way to seriously.
---
Andrew Gower is actually doing consulting these days, and has published a scifi game, [Solstrike](http://www.solstrike.com/).
---
He is rich AF though, so I'm not sure if CCP have enough pennies for his thoughts.
---
I mean you could block cell networks as they’re mostly too inconsistent to play the game on.
---
Could still allow people to download the game on them too which is what I would think you’d use it for.
---
AAR: Elo and a gang of jackdaws tackled a rorq, since he knew we were all redlit he was prepared to die quietly (love you beardy) . Since I was moving my super for the big boogaloo I was within drop range.  We than see supers warp on grid and the rorq panics. They warp to safes and cloak to wait out the panic. When they warp back Jar Jar praise his name warps to one of the supers at 0 bubbles lights the cyno. Brave and friends drops dreads , hero cats and regular carriers and 2 Nyx's. The other supers managed to warp off but this one hel got deleted withing minutes.

COMMAS, people, JESUS CHRIST

I think the game would be in a much healthier state without zkill.
---
Last I checked (bout 6 months ago) it seemed to have really died down from where it was the 2015 timeframe.  B/c of citadels would be my hypothesis.
---
Great video.  What's the next one about?
---
so his vanq pilot, a cyno or two and his 90 bots, right?
---
A voxel mmo is next level vaporware.
---
it's a new siege mode. it called Dead Goldfish mode...
---
I used too, not anymore though.
---
Used to be 30k people in this time a few years ago
---
Maybe warping to a citadel below or bounced
---
Baited on free redlight?

Hasn't EO jumped from FOTM Alliances for over a decade now?

eve is a bathtub sim not a space sim. fight me
---
Never not take the bait.
---
RiskVSReward has always been bullshit. I agree on the no subsequent balancing but there was no balancing needed that couldn’t be fixed with returning a rorqual back to a buffer role. Down vote all you want. Making nullsec like claimable wormhole space would resolve a lot of issues. It already has no local.

---
Probably Osmon for missions. Run the SOE missions and get decent LP. You *will* get locked up and scanned from time to time. Just don't carry anything stupidly shiny and people will leave you alone. 
---
For mining, just find peoples' moons and mine them yourself. Laugh with impunity when they say you need to pay them for access. They can't, and won't, stop you unless you're mining in Retrievers and Covetors (or the T2 versions thereof).

You will never find a low power upwell that takes only 1 week to kill, so 2 war decs. That's 200m sunk costs. The modules drop randomly like ship modules. Rigs never drop, same as ship rigs.  If it had in-process jobs on a powered station that you brought to final timer and paused the job, there is a chance some of the materials drop (not BP or reactions). 
---
Salvaging a station is a good chunk of isk but it is never enough alone for athanor, raitaru, or astra to compensate for the war dec cost unless they drop mods. T1 mods are okay isk, but you really want to find a structure with a lot of shit on it to be worth the time. 
---
This is one of the reasons structure spam and away from game structures are so annoying. If a smaller upwell has just a drill on it for instance, you are losing isk killing it and it will take about a week and a half even if unpowered, with a timer that may be shit for you. GL
---
&gt;Ya, I don’t get the benefit of skill queue tweaking away from the game. 
---
How long you been playing lol
---
uwu praise anime
---
IMHO -  it is the sometimes small/sometimes big (but always impactful) QoL changes that make me happier than shiney new features. Things like "The Agency" have made content waaay more accessible esp. to newer players. The global search bar in the upper left is amazing.
---
   
---
I think that if one looks past all the "reeeee" - there is still a fair amount to be admired. Yes, others are catching on and creating similar worlds. Tbh I think it speaks vumes that it's been over 15 years now and still no one has done what EVE has accomished as well or as consistently. But I have always said that Eves best feature isn't in the servers or the client. It's us. The community. We are EvEs best feature.

How can anything named after a character ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Costanza)) from Seinfeld be menacing?

yesss :-)

2 years?

I think ill leave a comment next week after i read all...
---
They will be safe because ganking after this patch will be a token thing that literally 2 people might do (kusion and me).
---
I can get behind the message in the second part of your post my man.
---
What happened to the new ore they introduced with the trig invasions?
---
You sound salty. Salt is not good for the blood pressure.
---
What's a red light? Like siege red?
---
They're basically weekly so you'll have no 15 waiting for you then too.
---
Have we decided for a name of the war yet? The Quiet Southern War is the thread title, I suppose.

What are Winter Co calling it?
---
3 minutes seems a tiny bit on the short side to me, given we have so many mechanics both offensive and defensive that take more time than this.

Lmao they really try to bribe the access for the asteroid fields?

Didn't Vily take over as Sky Marshall.

Less gay from you would help the situation

Means no krabbing capitals should be out, no saves, no srp for people who die on saves if they go out regardless.

They’ll have to find a new way to troll then, or commit more characters to their effort.

Before you do anything you should read up on Asset Safety.

Thank you for your comment! I will put explanations on maneuver basics.
---
Don't forget periods at the end of sentences,  sheesh.
---
KFIE-Z is an npc system
---
The actual reason you need to contact them is a limit on their ability to receive payments larger than x via PayPal or credit card etc. you need to organise a bank transfer. So you may not actually be able to negotiate too much more of a discount. No doubt you could get some but how much of a better deal I don’t know.
---
Try collecting World War 2 rifles.  
---
EVE is definitely cheap in comparison.
---
I understand completely. Mods really get the short end of the stick when it comes to communities. However in my opinion, as moderators, you all have to set the tone that you want in the subreddit. It doesn't matter about other people's subjective view on toxicity, what matters is your (collectively as mods) view on what is toxic. You are the arbitrator of what is acceptable.
---
If this is where you feel the attitude of the subreddit should be then keep doing what you are doing. However, if you think that the current attitudes of users on the subreddit are doing more harm than good to the community it is your responsibility to make it clear to the users r/eve what is and is not acceptable.
---
P.S. I appreciate the action you took on the guy I examples in my previous post.
---
Setting a stopwatch doesn't seem unreasonable here
---
on the first update i basically came back from some training as i had been afk while progod sorted some stuff. It was kind of a handing over point which really represented the end of the first phase of the war.
---
I don’t know what the fuck is going on but I wanna learn so bad to play.
---
About time test made a play
---
sometimes, depends on the number of fax and the incming dps.
---
you cant keep your tackle up while getting reps though
---
Huh? The ship in the picture has a 5s ROF. A single clip will last for over half an hour.
---
Mis-remembered? I thought you had the graphs and everything! I'm sure it has nothing to do with pushing your eve is dying narrative...along with the fact you still haven't once mentioned that player numbers might be down a bit due to the fact the largest MMO launch in 5 years happened a few days ago...hmm.
---
Cool story. A small group of Tuskers killed an XL SMA a few weeks back. Zkill notice pops up. I see it’s in blue space and a Hel dropped. So I de-siege in the crab machine and jump to a beacon in system. I eventually D scan the hel and enemy gang. Warp to grid. And there it is. An empty Hel being shot by 3 Cynabuns. I make pings on grid. And try multiple times to boarded the Hel while a few others try to punch off the Tuskers. I evenally die trying to board the ship. But another blue was able to board just after I was blapped. It sucks to see these niche scenarios die off, I would very much like to see no asset safety in null, same as it is in Wormholes.
---
Not the asteroid belts. 
---
The newish (at least these will be new for you) Refinery structures can be plonked down in orbit around moons in systems with 0.5 security (and lower). They periodically make artificial belts that can be mined. There's a fuel cost to running the structure, so people feel entitled to payment from rando third parties. 
---
They *do* get a record of who mines the belt, and how much.
---
i love how you call our quiet war in the south "minor conflict" when its coming up on 2rd for losses in a war EVER in eve history. its only minor conflict because nobody wants to ruin their own narrative.
---
I felt bad about having no losses since I just never died. Never dying even in frequent equal-number or outnumbered brawls made the game so boring. Like every time I log in it's just for green killboard.
---
I'm not even a great player either, just lucky that I'm never targeted I guess.
---
Take the blueprints, ditch the rest.
---
I thought it was supposed to deal with when you got stuck in the geometry or something?
---
Web scram for drifter, but yeah a plate would be helpful.
---
Man Test talks a lot of smack for an alliance that, despite months of trying, and lots of help, hasn't beat FRT yet. At this rate the UK will leave the EU before Test wins this war.
---
* solo battleship pvp
---
In that case his best bet is probably PushX or Black Frog Freight.
---
Pretty sure they arent all Wolf Rays, they are actually one of each effect. 
---
Redoubt is WR though.
---
“That stupid alliance that distracts us from our spod consumption”
---
Oof.
---
You can still use them, I personally just use them as a FOB. Drop stick, add on some turrets and EWAR, then drop an SMA. Then you can store ships and stuff in it. Or if you dont have access to a fortizar, you can fit a single capital in the SMA and have room to spare for subcaps, or you can just dump them in the bubble if you dont care about hiding or bumping them.
---
Scorch does wonders, and this is coming from a guy who avoids lazors.
---
The big base was in the range of 2-3 jump, i dont remember exactly the system. I remember KFIE-Z full with our alliance members, like 30-40 daily, mining, ratting and ensuring safety. Good old times
---
If unfueled citadels were like offline POS that would be great thanks
---
The why not war cause there is nothing else to do.
---
ITT OP is mad there is less low effort content.
---
How were the graphics.?
---
will some basic features for the new eve portal come to the app?
---
being able to actually reorder my characters without logging them all out then logging them in sequentially would be a small start, for example.
---
They own a Nyx, that's bad enough.
---
Nope, but I'm entitled to my own opinion and I believe killboard stats are cancer that prevents people from actually having fun.
---
&gt;Baiting mission runners into aggroing. Not due to any one change, but most of the old high-sec hubs are devoid of mission runners in lieu of better opportunities (probably a good thing), and those that remain are bots.
---
i mean...i still show up in osmon for missions sometimes. your free to try. might take the bait(will probably be in a pvp fit prepared....but its worth a shot)
---
Oh god, yes, I remember fiddling around with the short skills when I was online, and switching to a long one every time I was logging out. 
---
That was horrible.
---
I'm pissed it doesn't work on my phone. 
---
It says "Android 5 and above", but apparently Android 9 is too much for the app.
---
I really wish.
---
[pushx.net](https://pushx.net)

they can do it.

or just contact the locals. and see if they wanna buy you off.

i picked a random day in 2010, it was in january, it was 32k people. you aren't entirely wrong.

then i picked today in 2010... 26k

still a far cry from sub 15k, even if it isn't 30k.
---
&gt;The bigger blob doesn't exist. But it doesn't mean you are entitled to risk free farm just because you have the biggest blob.
---
Ah! I see now. So what you are saying is that it is now up to CCP to destroy what so many people have played and worked for so long to create because you are unable to. It bothers you so much that you are not top dog in the game that you want the game devs to intercede on your behalf to make the game easier for you because nullsec is too risky for you. I have some advice for you, friend. Why don't you just stay in your own part of the sandbox and let the bigger boys play the way they want in theirs? If you have the guts, grit, determination, and perseverance, raise an alliance that rivals the bigger boys and show what you got. All this bullshit crying to CCP that it isn't fair (unbalanced) that their blob is bigger than yours (nerf their shit so I can kill them without putting in the work and effort they did to get their stuff) is just that... a bunch of bullshit. We are all in the same sandbox. We all play by the same rules. You are not so important that the whole game needs to play by your rules. Test, PanFam, Goons, Init... these organizations weren't always what they are now. If you don't like the way they play, make a place for yourself and play your way. Its a friggin sandbox! HTFU. Crying to CCP that anybody is too strong and cannot be beaten so they must be nerfed is the epitome of the millennial mindset. Grow up, get a pair, and move on. Get better, or get out! Really. Its that simple. The game is not unbalanced when we all have the same rules and can get the same ships and mods. Its the players who are not balanced. And you, my friend, are vibrant proof of that.

Ninja salvaging. It was super fun, you made great money with little investment, and the complementary salt was awesome.

Sized rigs, the noctis and then MTUs killed it.
---
well they could be signal cartel. \~ ( - o - ) \~   
---
99.99% of the time. its a saber or that odd eris ( why )
---
&gt;As always CCP isn't killing EVE, the players are. 
---
Players act in their own best interest(mostly)
---
It's not players' fault that peace is better/more profitable than war.
---
Why’s that funny lol
---
HAHA LOOK AT THESE RETARDS DROPPING IN A SUPER UMBRELLA AND NOT BEING RISK AVERSE WITH THEIR SHIPS 😂😂😂😂😂
---
It is, but a side effect of that will be that intentional bumping by itself cannot hold someone down longer than 3 minutes
---
The locals are goons.
---
Anything other than ganking with a cloaky
---
ganking
---
How is that a bad thing?
---
Im not big on the scamming and cutthroat-ed-ness in my personal game play, BUT..I STILL willingly chose to live in a world where such options are possible! And I would fight for others privilege to chose such paths!
---
Your play style doesn't mean anymore than my play style. Nor is his style and more valuable than her style... and the difficulty or ease of game-play is only determined by a players research, effort and thought.
---
Eve has never been about pvp or krabbing or scamming or etc..
---
Eve has always been about the ability to choose. A true sandbox. You could name the other games that provide the same level of choice as Eve, on one hand. A living, breathing ecosystem captured in a fucking space sub simulator. It was/is the people who have played this game and the longevity of which they played that created it.
---
I forgot where i was going with this..
---
I mean, has brave dropped supers in the frat space 🤔
---
Back in the day (and I mean WAY back) there was a freemove option to rotate your ship.  It was unbound by default, deep in settings, and no one ever noticed it.  Except the people who did.  Maybe he found it again.
---
Double-edged swords are a bitch and a half.
---
I mean, he talked Casper into loaning him a Moracha, despite not being an amazing pilot, and has been in a bunch of fairly selective corps over the years, so I imagine he must be pretty cool.
---
yeah. try putting a fleet of them against barls and a lokis. 
---
i've been on the receiving end of this. jamed and nuted. not very fun. 
---
but it can indeed track like a mean bitch with long range ammo.
---
actually i take eveyting back. u can do it with a t1 hauler if you want it. they suck at tackling :P /s
---
Init they go!  Good luck lol
---
Imagine dropping 4 supers on a lone rorq out of panic and not managing to even get the Rorq 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Where is killmarks on a leshak? I googled a bunch and can’t find them anywhere

we also had the 2-3 week ceasefire in there that kind of buffered it.

---
Sitting in ECP8R in a Drake. Fortunately nullseccers no longer need to use gates, or when they do they can use a ceptor - so there's no need for them to even undock!
---
This piece is worthy of going into Internet Museum
---
That's not nothing tho. This is a mechanic that desperately needs some spicing up.
---
Balancing changes to mechanics aren't about totally destroying old strategies, but rather adding some variety and potential for counter play.
---
There are, unfortunately, some webdevs who make shit that only works right in IE, especially in non-tech industries.
---
That's how it works right now (being scrambled obviously extends how long it takes) or do you mean it also resets titans/supers or people who fit warp core stabs?
---
Yeah might have overestimated slightly but still shocking we only on 15k.
---
But not surprising with the state of the game.
---
&gt; fight me 
---
no, you are absolutely correct
---
How do you define a safari?
---
So in theory it could making warping capitals into a fight possible (not accounting for bubbles ofc)
---
My corp has about 38 characters shared between 3 people, and we don't have all of them in corp. I don't find it unbelievable that someone could have 90 if they skill farmed at a reasonable scale.
---
When you pay to play, who really cares where you are playing from? I guess lost ISK means potential PLEX purchases for them, but no one is doing that with PI losses. Also, if its just the planetary part and moving stuff around, there is no loss potential. Keep the pickup and move stuff in the client, so there's risk involved.
---
Literally unplayable
---
That's why i left NS
---
It doesn't matter much for "you are neuted dry" situation, when your cap is 0 all of these guns will be disabled for a few cycles (and when you hit 0 under neuts on e.g. megathron - you will normally hit 0 cap on leshak too; abaddon/apoc might be different due to lasers without cap bonus). It more matters for general cap management (less 3200's consumer per unit of time for example).
---
....there is no station in that link...
---
i always found all the little cargo platforms and solar harvesters in mission zones not being deployables sucked.
---
It snot really different than before.
---
Before this change people could logout and disappear in 5 minutes.
---
Now they will just warp in 3
---
And of the person logged off they would disappear in 5 minutes.
---
...*oh, for fuck's sake!* EDITED!
---
Cell networks can definitely hs dle EVE no problem.
---
I used to play console FPS through my cell connection and those require way tighter tolerances than EVE does.
---
I've been thinking of ways to make them usable for players once the old POS code has been excised with fire. I doubt CCP will ever do it, but I might make a post about it sometime this week.
---
so even if you dont have 70% speed in the required direction it will initiate warp after 3 minutes?
---
That still works fine, you just have to accept that you will die.
---
Motivated his enemy, demotivated his alliance.  
---
Motivation, above all else, is what keep your alliance alive and wins wars.
---
I had no idea what you meant by that until u/kristallnachte pointed out my error. Talk about a moment of epic derp...
---
Yeah...just tried some solo FW in a frigate, gave up and started playing something else. System after system of empty
---
imagine quitting the game because you can't bump freighters anymore
---
And with Vily now on CSM and summer over someone who has more time needed to take more responsibility in it, and lead day to day.
---
Rorqs get five minutes of invulnerability so not that hard to imagine?
---
Cool kill and all but smugging about killing a single non-faction super under your own umbrella??? Okay.
---
correct
---
&gt; I think pyfa is missing a few decimal places that make it land on the right final multiplier
---
Indeed, it ignores final less-than-half cycle for general UI (but calculates it properly for graphs, up to 68th cycle). Will fix that in next release.
---
What about the cyno generator array? Does that work? Can I use that instead of a cyno alt?
---
In the past PL would kill anything left on field. Now they fly ferox.
---
Which made me even more curious
---
The rorq had already used panic and they still didn't kill it, our umbrella was red lit so the only people who dropped were yolo caps and people who don't speak english
---
Also....inb4 white discord theme reeeee
---
Hats off to Origin for doing this. Not the first super lost in Impass and they are still doing this. Crazy.
---
It says Not Published, dunno if that means anything..
---
I love that he just fucking pings his fleets in our discord hahaha
---
Did you guys kill him and when is he coming back so I can whore on him next time 🥰
---
P.s Of course the capF dude is using a white theme.

No one cares. Most of us have been doing the same thing while cooking, doing laundry and watching GOT. Congrats.
---
That is not entirely true, it's just that the two best options either require an above-eve-player-average skillset (burning a ping ahead of the trajectory the freighter is bumping in) or require you to have your own suicide gank accounts on standby.
---
Does FRT know they are at war? With all the constant mining and ratting that both TAPI and FRT do, doesn’t seem to be a real war... but thank you for your post
---
Vexor will solo it

btw did wingspan stop making videos? haven't seen anything recent from him :(

He doesn’t use comms.  So that’s a BB deal breaker

It means you can't find it in the search system. There are several modules like the civilian guns that are the same way.
---
I’m curious what’s your “goto” ship for the WH roams and low sec fights you’re picking ?  Mostly frogs? You can’t really rat inside a WH without at least a decent cruiser no?  I’m asking because I too enjoy this play style and have limited time.
---
Playing this way doesn’t make you much isk I find... do you end up spending real world money on plex to fund your misadventures?  I do this sometimes.
---
Just curious, what time zone or time in “eve time” do you typically play? This can make a big difference in danger levels in some areas as well
---
Auto warping is bad thing.        
---
I don't know why CCP is adding this.
---
Well why wait 6 hours just to gank one freighter..... Bumping is an integral part of ganking....
---
See test understands that in order to sustain a long term war. You need to let your players play the game, rather than autistically burning yourself out in a month and then everyone stops logging in nd nothing happens
---
The graphs are right there, talk all the smack you want, unless you want to pretend you don't know how to count you can read that graph and see us at 2006 levels. If you really think regressing a games population by 13 years of growth is a good thing go right ahead say that.  
---
" along with the fact you still haven't once mentioned that player numbers might be down a bit due to the fact the largest MMO launch in 5 years happened a few days ago...hmm. "   
---
If you think WOW classic alone that happened a "few days ago" can tank eve numbers starting 2 MONTHS ago... I don't know what to say other than that you should talk your local high school and see if they can get you into some remedial math classes because you seem to have an issue with numbers.
---
That fc is so over-excited he can barely talk. Even basic commands require a small time for him to recollect... I mean I understand that it was a juicy kill, but still...
---
&gt; Now wait 2 years until SC is in release or playable beta
---
That was meant to be more than 4 yeas ago.           
---
SC will never be released as they are selling you ability to be part of game creation, this is their business model.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
ok i am bit old and lost here.          
---
Why people constantly say about cartoons on this subreddit, my assumption was that mostly grown up people play EVE.
---
Right click, Split stack.
---
Number per stack, number of stacks.
---
Please. This is what we need, not this chaos shit.
---
Growing up I wasn’t allowed cartoons that weren’t about Jesus. So it’s just me catching up
---
The other thing to not forget is this:
---
For every player that leaves EvE to play WoW, the IQs of both games increases.
---
Making stack splitting easier just caters to the lowest common denominator players that don’t want to bother shift dragging. Make Eve hard again!
---
Finally, a well thought out response to this kind of question. EVE was never made with the intent of being a blockbuster sort of game, you nailed it there. CCP is clearly aware of this, and its why they have been able to keep the game alive as long as it has been. I'm excited for the future of EVE more than ever, personally
---
Both of those require more than one account.
---
It _is_ ridiculous, this is a good change overall. 3 minutes is ample time to gank something.
---
ubuntu, sure.  technically, win2012 too, but for the 2012 server, why the hell?  OS isnt' meant for it and it will probably need to run in potato mode
---
Tbh it's not about hard, it's about annoying, if you ever did serious PI you know how bad it feels to spend 20 minutes splitting stacks every few days ^^

Having to spend time splitting stacks only separates dedicated players from casuals
---
His...fleets? That piece of shit went on to become an fc? Not that we needed more evidence PH has no standards, but come on.
---
That does not look like heaven...
---
Splitting stacks separates dedicated Eve players from casuals. The last thing we need is more dev time dedicated to making passive krabbing easier and lower effort
---
Wait you mean titans aren't hysterically OP in all circumstances?!
---
&gt;That piece of shit
---
I feel like there's a long and very interesting story behind this. I would love to hear it.
---
well, you caould always just point them... unless you're a hisec ganker, then you just need to act quickly.
---
Hm, If ccp devs had brain while making that program and have reusable code it's a thing of 10 minutes to add + 30 minutes for testing, that's maybe a 3-5 story at max if their code is somehow organized so that's no valid argument. I agree that making passive krabbing easier is always a bit risky but having put in so much time into qol pi changes I think this little thing would really make people like me happy who love to PvP and don't have endless time for the game due to rl and therefore have to have a way of making isk semi passive

It is hard to grow up in a sect.

I wanna rent server and they offer only those variants of os

Not for long it would appear...

Is it a Revelation-exclusive?

Look for JF service, typically, you can find local JF pilot with price less than PushX or Black Frog.
---
Don't forget to set collaterial on courier contracts.
---
There was no umbrella because the entire umbrella moved 3 mid points away. They knew this dropped 4 supers and couldn’t kill the one rorq on grid. The people that dropped were people that just happened to be there.
---
It only affects rich people who have stacks of items. If you can afford to have more than 1-2 of anything you can afford the time to split them. #firstworldproblems
---
Sorry mate weve all been busy killing 47 bears to find the one that actually has a liver
---
not true, this affects everyone doing PI on more than one planet. I admit on two planets it's still managble, on 4-5 it starts getting pretty annoying already
---
and these were all paid accounts - how many of these 15k yesterday were alphas?
---
Honestly I absolutely cannot wait because I will be able to move like 200 billion in a freighter and not have to worry anymore

He is the hostile dread in LXQ he's pinging so horde go and kill him

Yeah, you do that, have no fear, lol...

I mean not giving Jar Jar a Bifrost skin is the real atrocity here u/Seddows
---
Watching safaris on YouTube was the best
---
For long time returners CCP offered an one-time move out from nullsec, that is, they take one ship and teleport it to lowsec. It is worth a try, especially if you have/buy a ship with huge cargo.
---
It's not there. The old jove models were/are used for jove stations in their space though they may have been deleted when the jove died off.
---
You could always find a goon corp to join and then you could use their internal JF service to move your stuff to the main staging and then onto jita. Or you could stay if you find you like it, it's a pretty good place to find your feet after some time off.
---
I would use a travel ceptor for the blue prints though and watch warping gate to gate in aridia, LSH like to smart bomb the gates.
---
I've experienced the opposite... a few years ago it would always take ages to add anything to my account after paying, now it's almost instant.
---
The rewards for all of these events require you to login on unique dates, but before the downtime for the day or something like that. The event ends at downtime on the day they announced as the last one. So if you're in Europe you can't login after work on the day it says it ends. I wish CCP actually did regular dates, not downtimes, but I guess we have to keep in mind it's one less "evening" of playing.
---
Barges have big cargo holds?
---
"just drop dreads lol"
---
just another clueless f1 pusher that thinks he should post his drooling opinion just because he found the SUBMIT button.
---
At least EVE players won't have trouble with opening the help window, since most standard applications have it conveniently mapped to "F1"
---
You can buy PLEX through steam with Paypal. Also these people underestimating Chinese credit card warriors. Just look at the amount of Chinese CSGO accounts with 10\~20k worth of skins. These new generation Chinese billionaires and their children with nothing to do blow it on luxury brands, empty houses in California and internet spaceships for us to blow up. While I can't say for sure if RMT or bot or not, I don't particularly see anything wrong if it was a credit card warrior.
---
Lol no you don't.
---
meh
---
Hardly anything on the market, they should’ve set that up better.
---
Surely you'd use meson and have a tracking computer. 
---
Meson has best tracking and up to 80km range
---
Mystic will hit out to over 60km and it's medium damage.
---
So people only need to hit the F1 key repeatedly in order to get an MBA?
---
Stop posting

I'll give you the short story: If you leave bastion you're a traitorous fuck for the rest of time.
---
So, fuck bastion.
---
You can look at the stations in Jove territory using the map, all their stations use Gallente models now. :(
---
why?
---
Its not like much has changed.
---
Its only that you cant bump someone for longer than 3 minutes.
---
It's from the heaven constellation in the Curse region. The name is ironic but also appropriate due to how it was once the Jove's home, abandoned because of the Jovian disease, and now home to the Angel Cartel.
---
Now increase warp speed/acceleration/deceleration for slower subcaps.
---
DU is a blatant scam. Their head dev has been lying from day 1 about an imaginery high tech that he has no clue about and he is certainly not in possesion of. This magical server tech he claims to have the "knowhow" to actually develop, (but ofc he lacks the funding so that's where you idiots come in) would persumably allow millions!!! (yes that's right he said millions he is THAT shameless) to coexist in a single server with all thei stuff in it without lag!
---
Now here is the thing, if you had half a brain you would come to realise that should he actually be in possesion of such knowledge he would, from day one or at least as soon as possible provide hard evidence of it. Why? Because not only would that increase his crowdfunding by millions of dollars, but potential selling of this technology to games such as... idk... EVE maybe??? would net him several more millions.  
---
This "game" is based on an idea that is based on a lie. If you can't see through such an obvious lie you deserve to be scammed.
---
Don't let anime distract you from the fact that we need a lowsec gate to stain.
---
undock in a rookie ship, get a friend to 'buy it' (careful its not lots of isk) let him kill you. (not pod you)

pay friend back, enjoy free life

rookie ships work

Mate 20 pro here. I've also been given the middle finger.

Looks healthy. CCP\_Falcon shoud try it.

same as the https://eve.fandom.com/wiki/Eidolon or any of the other jove stuff it never got updated/was abandoned

not realey yet

There is small industry related to replacing those cap boosters also big LP sink

It's an older flex sir, but it checks out

He lit his cyno

This is a good change, then.

In a Year 2019 when we have  :         
---
* destroyers doing more DPS than a battleship              
---
* cruisers having more EHP than battleship         
---
* frigates with point range unachievable by all but one battleship      
---
^(powercreap is real)
---
* NPC nullsec pirate alliances

Ask them.

These people used to have an empire.

If you want to have fun GO PLAY WOW THIS IS A SERIOUS GAME &gt;:( 
---
What makes you think you are entitled to having fun AND A JOB?
---
I did./ they had no clue what i was talking about and laughed at this reddit post
---
We gotta buff the battleship!!
---
So, wait a minute. Isn't it just an indicator that shows how soon you will warp normally? Are they adding "warp regardless after a time" feature they promised a few years ago?
---
Dont people use gravity for energy, since capacitors and all that exists? So solar energy is not that big of a deal I think
---
LP sinks are meaningless. Gimme an ISK sink, which this thing could totally be.
---
Imagine smug-posting about killing a super in your own space lmao.
---
F
---
This is so good
---
This is not old school fucking runescape.
---
You can counteract that with friends or alts in a few ways. I'm pretty sure it's generally seen as a legitimate counterplay in a game like EVE. There are a lot of things you can't do with only 1 dude running 1 account.
---
What reason. This is not real life job. You get home hop on coms krab a beer with your co pilots set a camp inside enemy staging and fight the response or go roam.
---
&gt; Both of those require more than one account.
---
We'll be here until tomorrow if we'll begin listing things you can't do alone on one account in EVE.
---
There is a TEST keepstar being anchored in Detorid right now. They have no clue? You're not painting FRT in a positive light with this post.
---
half the internet made jokes about him "suiciding" before it happened because it was painfully obvious that it will happen one way or the other
---
Gross he uses white discord
---
A bit rude dude.
---
Thats not true. You are speaking from the perspective of someone who has played a while, not someone who watches a video and reads a bit about the game. They dont know what tidi is or how soulcrushing it can be.
---
The blackout wont do any of those things. In fact it will do quite the opposite. 
---
And those wont work as long as the blackout is in effect. You are missing a fundamental aspect about it. You dont know if its not permanent so dont play that card. The blackout wasnt needed at all, it could have been done in other ways, yet we still have it so dont pretend like you know the future.
---
It wasnt though, thats the problem. I have yet to hear one good argument as to why more isk causes any real issues. Or any real argument whatsoever.
---
No, thats my opinion as someone who is trained and work in the field. And that experience tells me you have no clue how economy works because you are stating we had "overinflation" when we in fact had deflation. All the BS about how the economy was broken is pure BS regurgitated by people who dont understand the theories behind what theyre speaking of and how it actually works in reality.
---
Right but none of those things mean that a player is trapped until downtime with no counterplay, which is the original point?
---
I didn’t know that i was supposed to paint FRT or TAPI in a positive light in any post...
---
well thats lame
---
Dude please stop. There is a ping in another reddit thread about a guy getting kicked because he lost his second Vanq to TEST earlier today. And its quite laughable to even suggest that you guys havent been fighting non stop (and losing mostly) for months.
---
Wont that Concord on grid where the gank will take place?
---
What do you mean by  ‘you guys’?
---
Coolaid or Bleach are also perfectly fine drinks
---
Is it the same guy that lost a Molok?

USA wanted to be the world policeman so we let them have it. Gotta say, they aren't going to beat our high score the way they are going.

I've seen a better understanding of 19th and 20th century history in a third-grade social studies class.

Oh, you took that as a serious comment...
---
...is that a head? Oh.
---
You do realise its against a fully setup super blob right? In tidi. Its not the first time cynos have been used you know. Capital hardcynos get blapped in that environment let alone a recon. People cant jump in like you think, its not one click and they jump. Everything gets broken as soon as tidi sets in and shit just stops working, including the ability to jump in. And if only a couple get through before the cyno goes down then those supers are dead.
---
And Im fairly certain that the smaller model of recons will create massive bumps which is another clusterfuck in itself.
---
Well ofc, just a sad trend
---
There is some truth in this, for example i absolutely suck at negotiation when it centres around money, i've bought cars off the lot for asking price, i never used to haggle, even in markets, i did a lot of freelance work where i accepted most offered rates without putting up a fight etc. As silly as it sounds i've got a lot better at it since playing eve and negotiating with other players, buying and flipping supers and that practice has paid off in RL for me to the point where i will haggle with much more confidence and demand rates from my customers having went from freelance, to contractor, to business owner all the while still playing Eve
---
part of me wants to point of all the logical explanations, but wont because it's scared the other part of me will tell it to just shut up and laugh
---
brave your pap is up
---
No he lost another Vanguisher plus an AT ship.
---
yes, we gated supers around frt space and even toasted w a wyvren 2 nights ago
---
FRT. Pandafam.
---
dont feed the troll
---
So.. retards on both side then, confirmed.
---
I mean we kill supers in other space.
---
Hail Jar Jar - and BO-LD in General :)
---
It’s an interesting article and positive press for Eve, even if you don’t think it’s true. I’ve been playing Eve for almost 13 years and leading Marines for almost 12 years. I’ve learned lessons about leading people in Eve that applied well in the Marines and lessons in the Marines that applied well in Eve. So, I think there is some validity to this article’s premise.
---
I was not arguing against the change. I merely pointed out that there is counterplay available.  
---
Most serious freight pilots will already have a webbing alt. I get that forcing people to have more accounts just so they can do a certain activity safely is not good game design, but if you are actually in snuff i think you understand the importance of alts quite well :)
---
they'll stop wow once their shitbucket fills up
---
this is what you call, not breaking invulnerability after a warp. noobs :D
---
yay another playstyle killed by ccp

Probably in AUTZ...

AUTZ

Possibly... Please don't give ccp excuses to not fix the shit changes they are making

*Glances at vodka bottle next to desk*

Why you gotta call me out like that?

i am confused. i don't know to up or downvote...

Its Delve - just join KarmaFleet, they only require some background checks and such, nothing more really. After that you can decide on what to do next.

Bravo... Just remember, bottom shelf vodka tastes EXACTLY the same as the expensive stuff...

Drink up o7
---
Hey..!!! Who u calling troll?? :shrug:
---
And theres the fallacy you kind often fall into. You have no clue how botting has been affected outside of it being less in NS. Yet you argue that its had a major effect. Thats called an assumption and its only based on the shortsighted idea of "what I cant see doesnt exist". 
---
But people, like me, have been saying that during the drifter invasion the bots started changing behaviour. All of the sudden the number of exploration ships imploded. And then the blackout hit and all of the sudden the amount of new chars in HS imploded. And now people are reporting that the bots in NS are still around, not in the same amount for sure, but still around.
---
So your suggestion is that people who make money of botting, i.e., their work is running bots, all of the sudden stopped botting simply because of blackout in NS? And you are completely disregarding the fact that you have other places where nothing has changed outside of a large influx of new "players". 
---
But you double down and say, no its had a major effect on bots. Newsflash dude, bots dont give a shit about easier or harder, botters might get inconvenienced but then they create new accounts and start running missions in HS. They dont stop eating irl because someone made their work a bit different.
---
Especially not when their margins got buffed since PLEX prices have fallen.
---
I'm actually getting into more pvp content now than I was back in 2014-2015.
---
Thank you
---
This is awesome. I've been playing with similar ideas lately. We definitely need more opportunities for fulfilling short session gameplay.
---
I'd love to see more spontaneous temporary cooperation between pilots happen outside of corps. Just inspiring each-other to go team up and do something small but fun outside of the sov capital metagame.
---
Would any of y'all want to start an in game channel to share ideas and collaborate towards building a community around playstyles like this?
---
It's not the only video game on the market.
---
This does not change warp mechanics. This is simply a visual indicator of how close to warp you are given your present rate of alignment. The bar slows down and even goes backward momentarily even when normally aligning a Battleship.
---
I agree that this isn't going to *prevent* someone from being able to potentially punt someone around for hours on end - but the difficulty level will be raised a bit. You'll need what, at least five alts to cover the 15 minute criminal timer by repointing the thing every 3 minutes?
---
This isn't going to stop the big guys with alt fleets - it'll make things harder, but they're obviously quite good at juggling alts and timers anyway, I have no doubt if it could have been ganked before, it still will be by them.
---
On the other hand, some random who has no backup and likes to ransom people by juggling them forever isn't going to be able to do that anymore.
---
I'm not sure if they grade it but....coarse
---
Dude I have no clue what youre doing. But its only working in your own head.
---
It’s already been established that you have no clue. No need to state it, dude.

I like to go to the local ALDIs and haggle over grocery prices with the bewildered stockers and clerks, too.

Commas are also people like Jesus Christ?..

My tastebuds must have been burnt off already then :D
---
To my knowledge 2 people have visited and roamed Jove space.  One was the person that recently visited every system, I think they took her there as a reward.
---
The other was an Alliance Tournament player that got loose (they used to do the fights in Jove space) and roamed around a bit before they realised, there were some pictures on the old forums I think.
---
Someone else managed to appear in Jove space on the map but wasn't actually there by using a warp trick to move 1,000s of lightyears in that direction from the nearest system.
---
And the low pop before that?
---
Only 1kg
---
Ccp stopped caring about old lore and old npcs, instead inventing new ones. I still hate it, that angel npc battlecruisers now use cynabel model and not the cyclone like it once was. Or that sansha only has three models in total, while still having npc destroyers and battlecruisers.
---
Yup. Totally agree... Except only allow citadels on planets... Moons still have to be only for refineries
---
haha enjoy them :)  We didn't........ Complaining bitches
---
[http://prntscr.com/ozj613](http://prntscr.com/ozj613) what about RMT?

Any decent vodka tastes the same as "high" end ones. Cheap shit like Jelzin is horrible tho.

---
I like going to local grocery markets and watch fruit sellers dropping prices by 1 cent at a time
---
Ironic coming from you when you couldn't read it properly in the first place...seems like you are the one in need of a math class to me so allow me to explain...just because player numbers went down by x last month doesn't mean they will fall by the same amount next month, I could pick any point in EVEs history that player numbers fell by x and then say at this rate EVE will be dead in y months and indeed many have, they all looked just as stupid as you will a year or 2 later though.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/HD3-JK_I_-_Academy_of_Aggressive_Behaviour there's this one.
---
wat
---
Space anus
---
In theory sure. Those fighters die really fast and you know it. Come on dude, they are in no way cheaper than battleships, not even the Nestor (I dont think I have a single cap that costs less than 2b). But ye I agree on the idea of what youre saying. There is a reason why they get dropped and its not to entertain.
---
Its not gonna change dude. Im not saying its a good thing, Im just saying that NS works that way. Thats why its better to ensure you guys have content elsewhere.
---
But Ill extend an olivebranch, lets say there is a scenario in which for instance trigs take over an entire NS region with their own PvE content. This region is cynojammed permanently and lacks stations. And it holds a key mineral that is required for capital production. In such an Eve I would be fine if all current capitals were erased (refunded). 
---
And this is me as someone who absolutely loves capitals, but I would be okey with it if it helped out small gangs. And I know it would cause it would take years for enough mats to be farmed for us to get back to where we currently are with caps. It would essentially be a soft reset of the server, atleast when it comes to caps (they should however be buffed so theyre worth the trouble).
---
In such a scenario its okey to subtract something cause we just added shittons of new content. Imagine how people will have to fight for this new material and even if the blocs join together smaller actors could intercept materials coming in and going out. And it will constantly get iterated on with completely different rules than we have in the rest of the game. We can have blackout, we can have no caps, we can have no jump drives and so on. And its okey cause youre not forced to do it, but you need to if you want caps. 
---
Now this is just a thought but you get my point. I want you to enjoy the game aswell and I admit that we have too many caps, I honestly dont even know how many I have atm and it shouldnt really be like that. So Im willing to go against my own wishes if it helps others and the game. 
---
But it has to make sense, the blackout and the cyno changes dont. It wont fix the underlying issues. And I understand CCP needs to have time to sort stuff out and something like my suggestion will give them time. But at the end of it, its still not gonna change the fact that the old Eve is dead. The game and the players in it changed and the days where small gang could find good content in NS is over, has been for a long time.
---
LS is where they should be able to get content but it needs work. Yet again, not saying people shouldnt roam into NS even in such an Eve but sooner or later capitals and supers will be back and they will be used in the same way. People have to accept that. But I dont think small gangs are complaining because they cant find content in NS, I think theyre complaining because there is no real content for them anywhere atm. Which is why I personally left LS even though it was fun, but it just wasnt all that fun. 
---
If LS gets fixed I will most likely move there again but if NS keeps getting fked I will most likely leave the game all together. Because I pretty much dont have other options atm. You with me? This is what I think most that have left are feeling. Subtraction works, but you need to add other options first.
---
Sorry for the wall of text.
---
Npc Sansha’s has 2 models of frigs
---
Chilling in stations, in front a news screen, or even in the hangar not having to look at shitty cash shop ads and corp ads
---
The pop wasnt low and content was to be had. Treid playing this game instead of staying docked?
---
&gt; it is completely obvious
---
It is also the first day after all the login-incentive stopped.
---
Is that now how it's spelt?
---
Lp sink is also isk sink
---
ye check your discord tell me that half off the dudes on it arent playing WOW
---
&gt;The pop wasnt low 
---
Denial,  not just a river in Egypt it seems.
---
I have 2kg, but the plate I chose couldn't take it all and honestly I really didn't want to fuck about trying to move it.
---
I don't get why people are complaining about this meaning you'll need to plex more accounts to throw some T1 corvettes at it to reset the timer. You don't gank on your own right? So just have literally anybody of your group of 30+ people point the damn thing once and you're good to go for another 3 minutes.  
---
This is a great change because some people are just outright griefing other players by bumping them for no reason for a stupid long time without them able to retaliate.
---
darkness
---
Wow classic and end of free sp for just logging in .  We are also getting close to the point where more and more people are at the end of 3month sub, and they decide to resub or not
---
Nerf some trig shit also...
---
Blame CCP for this. Long term good quality changes.
---
FC, why shouldnt we alienate a large portion of our players right before a new title that can act as our competition gets released?
---
Ah right they never made new models for them when they updated the graphics because they don't really get used.
---
Its just a temporary thing, and with the queues people will not stand it for long :)
---
Raised by wolves are recruiting.
---
Wow was never good though?
---
*gamer shares BBC with step mom*
---
Time to close this browser tab. Shits getting weird again.
---
fly t1 frigates.
---
ideally try to find fits that are atypical so you can get winning fights.
---
If you fly ships exactly how people expect them to fly, then people that you can beat won't engage you and those that will beat you will.
---
So if you can find brawly fits for ships people expect to be kity, and kity fits for ships people expect to be brawly you'll more often get people engaging you even when you have the advantage.
---
This is the pre-fight aspect of pvp.
---
This does not, however, mean just fucking up fits to be different. a lot of the time the typical fit exists because its better.
---
ib4 : those are only krabs and botters            
---
Honestly was i the only one that actually hunted those krabs and recently 'all my fish are gone'
---
*Asset safety is killing the game!*
---
/s
---
Hear hear.
---
I feel attacked.
---
You know, I guess you're right. Herding EVE players is not unlike communal crayon eating.
---
Its depressing, that people still play wow.
---
Yeah, the amount of people that consider mining profitable definitely shows you that not everyone in EVE would survive in the business world.
---
Who are Bastion again?
---
Clear cache.
---
Actually by the time I post this, I was able to log in.  
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll try it next time :)
---
Have some faith man, this might all be over in october. If not, well, not the first thing to get broken by shortsighted people.
---
The queues are part of the classic experience
---
I laughed way too hard at this, good stuff.
---
Do you really wanted to show both of your screens?
---
Well it was fun then, but aids as well..
---
the fuck does that even mean
---
So people have just not been buying plex and injectors due to classic wow?
---
if only ccp played eve right folks amirite?
---
Mining can be profitable if done right, its the "it's free if you mine it yourself" mentality that is the problem.
---
There has been shed loads of isk exiting the total in game. More than is accounted for by the increase in tax.
---
You are saying there is the same number of people out in space as before the changes?
---
Haha dude you sound mad. But in a funny way!
---
Did you just suggest that someone install windows 10 on a server... FML.
---
It's not auto warping though...
---
Isn't _that_ a bannabale offense?
---
Eve is older than wow
---
You will miss me, cause i was krabbing. Never died while ratting even with blackout.
---
Blackout just removed social aspect of the game and CCP said "best ship is frendship" RIP CCP GUARD best CCP-er ever, allready miss him and his clumsy eve streaming :D
---
Only one dude play in wow on my discord.            
---
Since blackout it is mostly wot, ?arma?, factorio, stellaris and ^(whatever is this game with moving death spheres and people shooting each other)
---
Depressing is what CCP made with EVE.
---
Blizzard is taking their monies now.
---
Game about shooting others without 'others' is boring.
---
&gt;Thats why its better to ensure you guys have content elsewhere.
---
I think this is horrible idea. If the only pvp content you get when you live in null is huge coalition/alliance level fleets then a lot of players won't go there or will get bored out of their minds. You want different kind of players living out in NS. You used to have lots of variety out there. Now it's just coalitions and hardcore pve players. 
---
Defending your home space against those roaming gangs gave corporation level pvp content to the players living in NS. Players don't learn to pvp unless they get constant practice in smaller scale combat. They get lazy and fat and that is bad for the game. You don't learn pvp if you just do big scale fleets where you press F1. FC's don't get practice in subcap warfare if people always just drop caps etc.
---
&gt;If LS gets fixed I will most likely move there again
---
There are no bubbles and bombs in LS. I happen to love those mechanics in pvp. I did PVP in null so many years that I can't return to LS anymore. The mechanics are almost like HS but without concord.
---
Peraps now that ccp killed his own game at middle term (you dont leave a game if you enjoy playing it), it s a good time to start wow!
---
I'd be slightly worried if it was a new WoW-level game with massive hype and delivery. That could actually have implications on eve player count that last for more than a few months.
---
Being WoW just means it's going to be powergamed to shit with nothing new to offer and only eve players who are at risk of being affected long term are people who never played WoW before.
---
Same as EVE

People bought injectors to mostly inject to rorquals - now excavators cannot be saved ^(the only good thing in all recent CCP changes)
---
wth nothing they release is compatible with my device... eve portal not compatible... eve echoes not compatible, yet I can play minecraft on normal render distance with fancy and get 60 fps...
---
Classic is awesome game. Feels fresh and Activision Blizzard sayed it should be much easier bring BC back, when foundation have been made.

this is good to begin with: [Novice Frigates Yearbook 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view)

So in 6 to 12 months.    
---
At this rate we will have 10k online in less than 6 months.
---
lol no komodo doesnt have highest damage in game. vanq can reach 32k dps with void xl and blasters and ~38k when heated
---
Last I checked Init is with the Imperium and they have killed rorqs and supers in Dinoland.

Never considered this till now ... and actually this is true.

Since blackout no one opened covno to me except for people in my corp.         
---
Lol, this looks more bad the more i think about it.

One time offer from CCP to returnees is that they can move your assets to a station you wish. Put a ticket and wait for a responds.
---
Also welcome back
---
Yeah. All sorts of people have various spending hobbies/habits. How much do some people spend on fashion or drinking alcohol? How is this not orders of magnitude healthier?
---
Check out MeaCulpa. Not sure what they are up too but they are good dudes.
---
How much ISK and time willing to spend on this are we talking about? How are your skills? There are a bunch of skills that are a "must have" for solo pvp. Skills that have an effect on all ships (agility, speed, being able to overheat, tanking, booster effects etc.) should be set as a priority. Most of the time you'll find fights where you are at a disadvantage, you'd want your skills to be as high as you can before doing that.
---
&gt; What Solo PVP Strategy is doable?
---
Depending on ISK and skills, a lot of them are viable. Some are more fun than others, some will get you on the path of becoming a good solo pvper, some will be boring (e.g. roaming lowsec in a garmur or worm will get you way less fights than going into an atron or rifter for example). 
---
Things to keep in mind: you need to find a good balance of survive-ability vs. engage-ability. When I was pewing in lowsec I found that some faction frigs were in the sweetspot. YMMV.
---
&gt; Are there specific counters in modules/ships/tanking
---
Eve pvp is a massive game of rock paper scissors. Most (not all) of the mechanics have at least some counters. Some of them are a bit overpowered, and based on where you decide to roam you'll find try-hards that have everything stacked in their favour. You'll learn eventually what looks like bait, what things you should engage based on the ship you're flying, etc.
---
&gt; Does my rating drop if I attack or kill a neutral pilot? 
---
Your security status does drop in lowsec. It is not affected at all in null-sec. Don't shoot people in hi-sec unless you are in a war with them.
---
Once you go below -5 you are a "permanent suspect" and people can engage you without taking gate-guns. You can fix your security status by purchasing and returning some items to some concord stations. You can do this in low-sec if you decide to go that route. 
---
&gt; Is it better to just bounty hunt and if yes how to?
---
I haven't played in a long time, but the bounty mechanic has been broken since forever. Even if a player has 3 gagillion ISK bounty on his head, by killing him you only get a percentage of ISK based on the value of ship you are killing. Bounty should play no role in your decision to engage a target. If they have bounty it's cool, but you should not base your decisions on this, it's not worth it.
---
You should also read on kill-rights, how to set them up, and how to activate them. Also read on bait mechanics.
---
Most importantly, as with everything eve, make sure you are having fun. Fly dangerously!

I don't think anyone is surprised by this. Especially since spending the evening doing stuff in another MMO most of the time means that you keep all your accounts logged out, so we do not have people playing with less characters, we have people not playing the game at all.
---
Actually that is a nice time for CCP to make these big changes, since a lot of players are distracted :)
---
#3... 2... 1...
---
[Here's the ''lecture'', at around 25 minute mark](https://youtu.be/N1KAorVC2ZI) but it's interesting to watch the whole thing
---
Yes, cause blizz increased limit of people that can be loged into server.
---
There is a blue post about it.
---
If you want to be social, you can talk in local and make your presence known :)
---
Thats true, both of it.
---
Idk how to get around it. I just know that the current direction of nerfing big gang so accomodate for small gang isnt working. And its showing on the rapid decline of players.
---
But honestly, somewhat balanced versions of blackout and cyno changes might work aswell. Im not totally against the ideas but these versions are way too extreme. Whatever change gets implemented it needs to be accepted from both sides otherwise it wont work. There needs to be a discussion where both sides present arguments and eventually an agreement is reached.
---
Like you convinced me with your post that it might not work to completely divide the groups. I still belive the option should be there but its true that some small gangs want other things that require NS space. So there needs to be changes that can help that out but if the other side doesnt like them then we will have players leaving in masses, like now.
---
Shouldn't show your account names on public forums. You'd be wise to take the screencap down.
---
Simply it will reduce targets and with reduced targets there is less reason to login
---
Yes, but they often mean things like losing ships. Here it's literally the worst that can happen. So, same shit, basically?
---
Ofc it's low commitment on attacker's part. But hey, that's Hisec for you.
---
Good, when people leave eve for wow, iq in both games raise
---
As a German, Teiglavian sounds like food...

I disagree. I think the effort needed for splitting stacks is gratifying. etc is right, you’re just greedy with all of your big stacks
---
Before blackout i met like tons of player. From US/China/Germany and many other, had good time talking to them on local before we move to private channels. Smack talked with gankers, got in trouble it was huge part of the game. You can even clall for help casual blue people.
---
Hilmar should explain us how we can make friends with no local. Nullsec blocks all split all over diffrent alliances, there are no reasons to talk if u cant see them.
---
Now space is empty, black hole. How this can be not depressing? I spend years in WH and i know in long term its just boring.

I had a play around with an Amarr Maurader and while I could tank the damage easily I couldn't hit the frigates at all and they could tank my drones. I had to hastily make a combat ship on my miner alt with 3 webs and rush to the aid of my main in order to slow down the frigates sufficiently to hit them.
---
I've theorycrafted a Caldari Marauder with rapid heavies, stassis grappler, faction target painter, boosters and implants that should theoretically work solo but I have yet to put it to the test as I'm currently in a WH. When the wife goes away for a week I'll be testing the theory out ;)
---
Bring about 1 billion worth of modules, ore and T1 frigate/dessie/cruiser hull BPOs to amarr FW warzone in a freeport of your choice with manufacturing. It's easier and cheaper to haul in ore and manufacture on site than haul the completed hulls.
---
Your sec rating drops when you attack/pod other players in lowsec without limited engagement active. Low sec status is pretty irrelevant and you can bypass it with a travel sunesis, hecate or whatever. The biggest problem is you can't cloak in hisec when the police are after you, which is not good when you're free for all.
---
You can avoid the neg standing if you want by buying/hunting clone soldier tags, going from -5 to 0 is about ~300 mil or so.
---
This tastes* so good.
---
I live in Sasiekko, 0.5 border system to amarr/minmatar factional warzone. The skillceiling is high, but less blobbs. That zone totaly needs more youngbloods with normal fits, who want a good fight. There is always someone to fight, in the beginning you will lose more then win, but you learn.
---
With less content. Me i dont want to log anymore, where i m usef to live (no no it s not in fountain...) there is almost no target.

Nah they are trash. I keep losing 1v1 against them in FW.

Been playing since 2004, had/have a speech impediment (stutter), ran a corp/alliance in eve, now own/run a multi-million pound company where time is mainly spent on the phone, without Eve I would not have had the confidence or learned valuable skills needed to achieve what I have in RL.

I just drag the stack while pressing CTRL ...whats the big deal?

just put a grappler, a web and tracking computers on the paladin.
---
Depending on how good your ISK source is, I'd say just take random shit out and see if it works. There's probably no better way to understand PvP than to go out and fail at it a dozen times. Guides will tell you *what* works, but not necessarily *why* it works.
---
Depends on what kind of NaCl, in this case I'd say he is correct since it's for cooking. 
---
If it were for use in a laboratory/industry then he is wrong because then it would be graded by purity.
---
What makes you assume he did any of that?
---
Yeah it's a fair point, I'd just say that, really, it doesn't change much for the attacker (if you can't gank within 3 minutes, you're just going to have to point the ship briefly and lose a corvette), and CCP have stated that they consider incessant bumping to be harrassing behaviour so I do understand why they are keen to fix it.
---
Just because space has no preferred orientation, doesn't mean the nav computers don't have one. 
---
The lack of spinning rings anywhere kind of implies artificial gravity is a thing, that would definitely make docking orientation really important. Might make sense to choose an an up/down across the disk of each solar system and tell all nav computers to respect it when they enter system.

CCP is to blame hilmar said eve gave 1 Billion Euro Profit over the years and ccp only reinvested until 2010 or so, then they did nothing. Put down devs from eve for sideprojects, layed off devs who spoke up and layed off community teams. If he would have reinvested atleast 30% or more from that into eve this game would still have 60k+ players since we would have a lot more stuff, content and balance. On top that lowsec, Factionware etc wouldn'T be treated like unwanted children.

"Tank Spotted Sergeant"

"Tackle it! We're on our way"
---
Well, yeah, it affects people doing that just for kicks more than organized gankers who will probably have alts to spare anyway, seems good.
---
Other people suggested that cited reason is ships being stuck on citadels.
---
Relatively low impact on organized gankers seems justified as a result since it's probably not what CCP wanted to touch. Although there's a complaint that a lot of changes trouble "bigger guy" the least, but then again it's not like ganks that require long bumping sessions to setup was something individual folks did, unless they already have a ton of alts or something.

If rattlesnake is fitted correctly then you wont be able to kill him with ant t3c solo
---
Well recent changes, ccp's lose in trust from playerbase since they still don't put eve on their forefront of dev work company wise. A game which survived with trust by its playerbase is of course to decline when the company said it made 1 Billion Euro profit with it but didnt put even 10% of that back into the game. Imagine if they would have been wiser put 30% revenue back into the game and hired dev's instead of layed them off. Same for Community Teams. We would have a lot more content, fixed stuff, lowsec and fw wouldn't be treated like shit, and balance would have been a major focus.

---
Yeah, mining is probably the most profitable activity if you still have 20 skill farm accounts and the autism to use them or if you have access to moons pretty frequently.
---
Not really, they just require more alts. Which seems where all of these recent changes are aiming at. That money used to buy CCP must flow back somehow.

Talking to yourself is called " schizophrenia", so no thanks.
---
I honestly don't get why blackout needed to be a thing. Local has been in null since release 16 years ago.
---
Skilled hunters were able to get kills and attentive ratters would get away.
---
But for some reason it's locals fault that everyone is krabbed up in super umbrellas and not any other of the plethora stupid things CCP has added to the game.
---
Removing local just helped bad hunters get kills and get everyone else to stay logged off.
---
Olmecas will never have a healthy affect on this game.
---
You can get 4 on it if you give up a low slot on the legion. Anyway Legion vs Loki is going to come down to if you want to have and use the Neuting power of the Legion Core - Energy Parasitic Complex. If you want that power then use the Legion otherwise i'd reccomend the Loki.

---
2 day passed after reply and you’ll maybe not see my answer but anyway I’ll try to explain this in your language...
---
Subcap cyno is like crited wh. You’ll be sure you can jump a stratios or few bombers, but you’ll not risk your 15 man leshak nestor fleet into it. (you need to find other connection with better hole) 
---
Fax or dread cyno works like large wh, you will need this to jump some of your caps.
---
In capital fight, a subcap like T3C and inty, bomber cynos first and jump fax/dread or super with cyno. As I said, you can’t rely on a crited wh which can disappear in any second for your main fleet. 
---
So jumped dreads/faxes/supers open capital cyno for main fleet, it works like stable wh for your mainfleet, which is needed.
---
You can say like “You can jump fleet if you can find many crited WH”, which is true.
---
Capsuleers will and must adapt in this way for sure, but I’m also sure preparing 40 cyno alt will be so unfun and dumb.
---

How? Please explain, youre not gonna blap the enemy cynos with your carriers in 10% tidi,and youre certainly not gonna alpha it unless you have hundreds of subcaps on field. This is not even taking into account that you can easily set up several cynos, which you are really underestimating.

Nope.   I played WoW in Vanilla and I'm playing in Classic now.  I don't know *how long* I'll play it but I'm having fun in it now.
---
Gotta admit, the whole Chaos thing has burned me out a bit.  It's a nice change of pace.
---
Establishing warp vector probably translates better that the time it takes to align is dependant on the align time characteristic of the ship.
---
Yep! And ninja looting, too. I got some quality rage in local last night after swiping red loot.
---
Do init take anyone on now?
---
Lol so I had to copy and paste it again 
---
So what your saying is that you were booty blasted by old PL so many times they fled to the other side of the universe and everything you do is at some level dictated by that PTSD
---
£33? Thats acutally quite reasonable given the venue.
---
WHATS IS LOVE ?
---
THe difference is that a cyno is a time limit while the mass issue is an actual ship limit.
---
If everyone jumps together and immediately, the likelihood of them being split up is dramatically reduced n the cyno and unchanged on the wormhole.
---
And wormholes are limited to 1, while cynos can have multiple.
---
But also, how much damage is potentially on field if you are jumping only a 15 man fleet onto it?
---
Thats like a titan skin /s

---
Use a Procurer rather than a Covetor anywhere except high sec. For the second ship either another Procurer or a cloaked tech III, as someone else suggested.   
---
If you use two Procurers it's wise to fit them for PvP, so fit point and web and it's also advisable to fit a DDC in one of the lows. You can seriously surprise people with a couple of pvp fit Procurers if they haven't scanned you first.

I usually am exploring with an Astero when in the mood for pvp which I can use to engage ventures/explorers. I’ve trained up / fitted out a stealth bomber for taking on industrials but found finding targets for that takes way too long. In low sec pvp I’m just using t1 frigates to keep costs down. 
---
For pve I started with a drake (~70m) then just moved to Gila (~300m) which can solo a couple of the c3 sites  and is most of my income (maybe 70-100m in a 1hr play session). Saving up for a rattlesnake now but want to see how long I go in my gila before getting ganked before spending the 500-600m on a basic rattlesnake. 
---
Before getting the drake / gila I made most of my money via relic/data hacking in wormholes. Found I could come home with 100m+ after a 2-3 1hr play sessions getting lost and finding my way back
---
I’ll spend real world money mostly on a skill injector if I want to try something new. I get worried about spending it on ISK given my shinty ships tend to blow up - feels like could quickly spiral if I say start paying for my rattlesnake with real world money and then lose it immediately.

We made a business out of citadel bashing (the replacement for legacy POS),  Loot is ok in HS, in addition to mods, fuel, fighters and salvage, stuff being used in processes can drop which is often overlooked.  For example, industry Jobs in progress or completed but not delivered.  Not to mention the impressively deep wallets for ransoming.

roam nullsec areas in a high dps ship and fight everything.
---
solo pvp in fri dessie is fun in lowsec.
---
cloak up, go into a wormhole and always take the bait
---
The article is pretty funny, it pretty much says that MBAs are wothless because the people with them have the same grasp on business practices that some spaceship nerd does.
---
Glad i didnt sub another accout for a year i would be in such a bad mood. i dont even want to think about it ;D.
---
Show me where on the doll Brave hurt you.
---
No seriously, 30 supers get safe logged in our space for the last 2 months and all they have to show for it is 1 rorq kill in exchange for a dead titan and this dead Hel. Eleet pvp dood
---
Why do our ships begin decelerating immediately after reducing thrust, in a vacuum the ship should continue at the same speed when thrust is removed.
---
I love the salt reference.
---
the thing on new edens ships are powered by an unlimited power generater. it also has an 'anchor' to space time.
---
without the unbelieveable amount of thrust it takes to move this anchor accross spacetime and the mass of the ship itself, the ship attached to the power anchor, brings the ship to a hault quite rapidly. 
---
its tech that 2019 doesnt quite understand yet, so its fine if your cross and dont understand it yourself.
---
This change just raises the threshold of what is worth carrying, but not to absurd numbers like that. 
---
If 200b pinata is coming through, im perfectly happy to sacrifice a few tackle ships to concord to reset the timer.
---
The fact that he's in Frat?
---
On the right side iirc, slightly front of the model of te ship
---
Because Eve players are drama queens. They're reactions to changes are about as subtle as a soccer player getting tapped on the shoulder during the world cup.

I think WOW Classic is too convenient of a reason honestly, most people who play EVE play it solely b/c it's not another MMO like WOW. With that said I do believe people are checking WOW Classic out b/c their EVE Online game is currently being unraveled and destroyed.
---
This is much more likely to be Omega accounts expiring / running out - we are beginning to see the domino effect of people quitting due to the dumb shit that was implemented / plans to be implemented. We can only hope this isn't long-lasting.
---
want to try kiting?

You should call it Hilmar on his Throne.
---
If this is a copypasta I’m missing the reference
---
Why not both?
---
Well they did NOT get paid enough for the type of food they had to eat lol. Since he was marines and not airforce that is :)
---
But still it is sad what happened to EVE.        
---
Like it is still very fun game, but from a 2nd job we are getting into 2nd job with overtime and annoying boss.
---
Nice!
---
Over the last 5+ years buying power of ISK has increased, buying power of PLEX has increased, and yet somehow everyone yells about inflation because... I don’t know, RMTing is not as profitable anymore?
---
Eve doesn’t suffer from inflation, it suffers from overabundance.
---
You just hit the spot. This made me quit. 2nd job.
---
Brexit before  ;D
---
Hiding from trauma only makes it worse, and insisting everyone else police their language to suit your sensibilities is a dick move.
---
I have an idea why. It lines up with the end of login for free skillpoints. 
---
Beyond that CCP doesn't leave people without a reason to not bother logging in.
---
Expect the decline to continue throughout September with a substantial drop when the cyno change hits, to be followed by another substantial drop when they remove asset safety. 
---
The asset safety chaos is the one to look out for, I believe it's going to effect the most serious decline so far.
---
Okay, bye
---
now that I believe
---
Ding
---
Of course the dropoff also coincides with the end of the "login for extra free skillpoints" events.
---
That's the point. At some point people quit WoW for a reason. Once the nostalgia of WoW classic wears off, people will start trickling away from it.
---
Dont know how long nostalgia will last for you, but eventually, you'll probably burn out of WoW same way you did in Eve
---
&gt; drinking alcohol                     
---
^(Raises hand)
---
I don't remotely understand what you're implying when you say this is CCP, normally that would imply that the system will be entirely disfunctional.
---
But how will we anchor an astra om grid of a small corps fort that we want to wipe out for lulz???
---
88 miles per hour!
---
+1 to awesome play style and detailed explanation. I always wanted to play this way, but keep getting distracted xD
---
gj using 14 year old statistics from some ancient website that hasnt been actively used by everyone. Besides that, where are the statistics about the ages of players who backed (not "bought") the game? cause you missed the link for that one.
---
In other words, stop spreading fake rumours
---
FWIW I've been playing since Day 1 and I haven't seen a queue.    But I also made an effort to avoid the popular servers.
---
Eve Paris is 5€ 
---
But the venue is less classy :p
---
&gt;will be entirely disfunctional
---
Yes, my point is we expect scrams to reset this timer like the safe-log timer. By being dysfunctional it would not work as expected being CCP.
---
^
---
I thought the narrative was Eve was too easy now and was filled with know-nothing PVEers?   That's the whole point of the Age of Chaos.
---
I think the days where Eve players could cop an attitude about being smarter ended a long time ago.
---

have a look at the roadmap and the development video's. They have been very clear and open about the whole development process and what they want to achieve. Most people i've spoken from the game communities that are still excited about star citizen don't actually mind waiting. They see great progression, good graphics and a great plan and roadmap. And thats why they backed it. Not to play it now that its in early alpha but to play it once they finally got all the pieces and made it a full experience.
---
You might think this is "wrong", and its you're right, your opinion. But in reality, its just a long term investment like all kickstarter projects. Star citizen actually delivers quite well in comparison to all those zillion game kickstarters that didnt even release their game.
---
Last thing to add, you say "ive worked in the business for 20 years" and "250mill dollars is a shit load of money". If you really worked in the AAA game business, you would know that 250mill isn't actually quite alot and that they managed to keep developing for over 8 years solely on that budget with a huge team is actually quite impressive
---
I’ve actually learnt a lot about communication via Eve. I’m a lot better at communicating and managing what and how much information I give to someone. Definitely not a degree equivalent, but I have had exposure to the worst and best of people that I wouldn’t have otherwise had.
---
interdiction nullification
---
Not really an issue, I can get lots of good things done inside 3 mins....
---
I'm not saying it broke it. You said hindered and no matter your stance on the issue, I think we can all agree it does hinder
---
What spin? Frat don't post anywhere.
---
depends on the loki, and well. depends on the t3c fit tbh. loki / tengu can easily be over + 40 while repping if fit normally but a little shiney
---
It's not hiding from trauma to ask my community to not normalize casual use of a word that represents an epidemic of violence my peers have faced.
---
There are plenty of words that our culture does police for good reason. I shouldn't have to explain this to you.
---
If you understood what you are defending from the perspective of the abused I think you would change your mind.
---
I understand people have a limited capacity for change at a rate they can process but that doesnt mean they get a free pass to never reflect on the impact of their words.
---
Reduce speed of the other interceptor line by like 20% and same for agility.      
---
Combat interceptor fixed.
---
Of 300 people in discord last night I saw 2 people playing wow.
---
We need some free skillpoints login incentives to boost those activity numbers some. But something where you have to undock and kill a rat to get them.
---
One crucifier leaves it impotent.
---
ADC
---
Good Game. next time Someone from Brave, REQ, CVA, MANGO, Goons, and the rest of your Blue lose a high value Ship we can post  
---
"OMFG TEST LOST ANOTHER SHIP! GF!"
---
I'd agree if I didn't notice a significant drop in activity in space (in WH specifically) since last week as well as a steep drop of people logged into corp.
---
WoW is absolutely having a significant short term effect on player population.
---
how the fuck is this fit cap stable xD
---
Give it covert cloak, instant locking after decloak, leshak level rampup dps, longer range, more cap.
---
Turn it into the solo super killer
---
It's staggering how many people don't understand basic economics. "I build this ship for minerals I've mined myself so the price of the ship is profits no matter how much I undercut the competition".
---
high grade crystal + active tank rattle with cruise missiles. keep a mobile depo nearby and refit to tank\\dmg\\cap according to situation.
---
Can do up to mid beacons , but with drugs\\OH
---
&gt;It's not hiding from trauma to ask my community to not normalize casual use of a word that represents an epidemic of violence my peers have faced.
---
It's entirely hiding from trauma. Rather than face your traumas or simply move along you instead latch on to a single word and try to use your personal experiences to force a set of rules on everyone else.
---
&gt;If you understood what you are defending from the perspective of the abused I think you would change your mind.
---
Oh but I do, my dude.
---
&gt;impact of their words.
---
This "impact" is entirely manufactured by you. If you seriously are so upset by text on a screen that you must insist on policing everyone else's language then the issue lies with you, not everyone else.
---
I like the idea of adding a combat probe fitting bonus
---
Partly depends on what you are defining as large.
---
The cost of force recons on the ISK scale of a large cap fight is negligible.
---
The rarity of alts / ships for the force recons isn't going to prevent it.
---
Once TiDi is in place the number of people from outside of Tidi who should manage to jump to the cyno before it dies should be decent.
---
More random? Likely some more losses? Sure. But it's not as if random bumps didn't happen before. Yes, previously those random bumps could light cyno / get faxes. But the cyno stayed in place where they lit it while the hull still drifted off. Same going forward with a force recon except with a bit of practice the force recon can get AHEAD of the bumped ship's course.
---
Any attempts by ccp to force people to fight in game will be met by using out of game mechanics to remain bluetral with most of the game... yikes
---
Make them worth half the price of the other ones in Jita!
---
Winning submission right here
---
Surely.  I've won WoW... and EVE ... several times.  ;-p
---
If there are any cap balance roundtables
---
ima take you to the bar
---
Damn jar heads o7
---
I think the symbolism shown here is that The Horde will always come out on top above all the salt that is outputted by Goons and TEST
---
Give them Warp core stabs inbuilt same as the Venture and a bit better fitting and capacitor and possibly a sig reduction (Not 100 % sure about the sig as it could be a buff too far, I would welcome opinions on that.)
---
This allows it to have the role of "On Grid" tackler. IE it can get to target already on grid faster by burning to it while actually doing dps where the nulli intie is better suited to pings out and warp ins onto targets and being initial tackle first then warping of as well as taxiships.
---
I went and asked for a raise when I read this, My Boss asked if I played in work? "All the time" I responded. I am no unemployed and playing eve fulltime. In two years I should have a Noble Peace prize!
---
Please no.
---
Tricking mission runners to join your fleet so your main and friends who were at war with your alt could freely attack the mission runner.
---
You forgot doomsdays.
---
That actually a nice idea.
---
The o2 will have turned into Mad Max's thunderdome by Novemeber.
---
I think this is the main reason we are overlooking and using this wow as a less than genius excuse.
---
We haven't been able to see the real effect blackout has had on login numbers because of the immediately introduced login for free sp bonuses that have just now expired.
---
Untargetable by rats too.
---
The issue wasn't XiX, it was the renter model that pretty much promoted botting, next to zero supervision from your land lord, allows you to do pretty much anything in their space.
---
Brothers of Tangra for instance which was the NC. renter alliance for years as well, got pretty close in the pie chart from ccp peligro to the XiX renter alliance.
---
What it was somewhat surprising in that chart however was how many bans did the Fraternity renter alliance ate despite being a very young renter alliance, that plus the tales from Serenity of how botting is not only accepted, but encourage, gave people the impression that the Chinese players think that botting is okay even in TQ.
---
I have to say that i'm always curious anytime i see someone pointing the finger at the Russians in relation to the botting that went on in their renter alliance, especially those in the drone regions, and i have to ask, what do you think happened to the botters of the drone regions, when XiX got kicked out? 
---
Because based on my own impression roaming the drone regions prior to the xix eviction as well as after the eviction and the formation of the HRE, the botters that i saw frequently in the Drone regions didn't move, they simply started paying a different landlord.
---
Eve isnt your conventional MMO though. It doesnt really have any endgame.
---
All on medium and tiny but usable.

---
Well we don't want to overdo it here.
---
I'm confused. Do warp stabs allow use of MDW if you have enough?
---
I think so too.
---
imagine being Stainguy
---
10sec scram immunity with a 1min cool down.  Great for "flyby" scrams of fast targets (to not get counter scrammed).
---
You could also be in a tight orbit with dual prop, see your tank isn't going to hold much longer, turn on scram immunity, turn off AB and turn on MWD, then burn away.  By that time, your fleet should be able to supply secondary scram.
---
All just bots, something something
---
No dude. You have to wait for the peak on Saturday and Sunday, that's all bullshit. /s
---
The problem is, that 3 or 4 months means habits and desires change. The thrill of EVE may have a strong chance of not coming back for a lot of those that actually make the break. Like all bad drugs.
---
Imagine talking about standards while in Bastion.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/character/949706482/](https://zkillboard.com/character/949706482/)  Was their CEO awoxed prior to leaving?
---
If you are willing to commit at scram range than a Legion is a bit more likely to kill a strong active tank than a Loki, but it is far from a guarantee (especially if talking about JSpace rattles). 
---
Loki offers greater flexibility in the hull and the option to not commit in scram range, however with your skills you won't be able to use all of that flexibility due to a lack of gunnery skills restricting you to HAMs/RLML.
---
In a T3 vs T3 solo the rule of thumb is if both are decent active fits no one wins, but a legion with 2 neuts is more likely to break a strong tank than a Loki. That said running 2 neuts makes an active tank on that Legion notably weaker and you realistically can get burned though before your neuts turn off the opposing active tank. You are mainly going to be able to kill buffers and shitfits.
---
Yeah, then removing that was definitely a bonehead move.
---
still less salty than I've been lately.
---
I was told on this sub that wow classic would not hurt eve at all.  And all the krabs should leave and leave the real elite pvp’ers alone with eve.  How is that working out?
---
"Eve teaches skills like \[...\] conflict resolution "
---
I almost spat out my coffee.
---
Yeah, we resolve conflicts by blowing each other up, back stabbing each other and spais everywhere.
---
Oh, wait, that actually is like real business...
---
Sarge, what do?
---
After much research over many years, I have to disagree. Some high end vodkas (Grey Goose and Crystal Skull especially) taste the same as a standard vodka (Smirnoff or Russian Standard). Then you get to what I call high end vodkas (Chase, 42° Below). The diffetence between these vodkas is like the difference between Bells whiskey and a single malt. One needs a mixer the other only needs some ice.
---
With the ~670 dps of a 2 neut HAM legion in many cases no, and even if it will it will take a few minutes to do so. Going double neut is going to make running your own active tank MUCH weaker and if you opt for buffer instead the Loki will outlast you anyway.

Classic wow is an old game. Nostalgia is old.

I have been friends with a few Marines in my time and this is the first I have heard of communal crayon eating.  Is that because they were all officers? (Ironically, I knew most of them from when I got my MBA.)
---
The only other Marine I know decently well is a neighbor who fought at Tarawa, then lost a leg in '46 when some heavy equipment fell on it....   Then won a ballroom competition.  oorah!
---
Did he say jump?
---
Adapt!
---
There are literally dozens of us!
---
Well today you learned that your friends like to eat crayons alone.
---
use noobships, scram every 3 minutes to reset the timer until the gank fleet is formed, profit
---
Sounds like you're very high in agreeableness.
---
They are on ships sometimes, no?  And get to ports-of-call when on a float?  (I am no expert, I just know the army isn't always a picnic either.  A HS classmate told me about Ranger school.  90 days of MREs, and since it was the early '90s, and he was an observant jew, that meant 90 days of only Tuna MREs.)
---
As am I. The technical skills I'm referencing are for automating mod actions and reporting. You need a lot of bots to get things running smoothly - things that should just be default to reddits mod tool suite you have to build yourself. Whenever you see a subreddit that's fairly inconsistent on modding (in the sense where the moderators themselves are consistent, but the content on the sub is not) - that's a sign that they do not have the tools needed.
---
It's a community effort though, everyone is free to pitch in. We've only got what volunteers.
---
CSS is important to. There's a lot of stuff you can do with it to help actual content moderation beyond 'making it pretty'.
---
People can mock but stressing the organisational skills you have to use in Eve has got me and corp mates jobs. In no way do I claim I have a MBA, or equivelent, but it can help. Just try to keep it short and dont go into the details, unless asked to. Talking about sneaking up on people for a solo kill doesnt help either.
---
Cat Ears

Remove the point range from the fleet version and add it to combat version.

Battleship sized guns

Game changes in the last 3 or so years have also had the effect of reducing my impression of the average EvE nerd.

I was in dreads squad hanging out bored in staging keepstar with nothing to do, suddenly a Vanquisher. Cannot forget Vily's shouts =))
---
What you typically see on YouTube video is only a small aspect of PvP combat.  There is a ton of stuff happening prior to actual engagement in space.
---
1. You have to decide how much money you can afford to lose in combat, since ship losses are permanent.  
---
2. You have to decide what type of tactics you will employ: stay in one place and fight hostiles passing through, or roam around and bring fight to whoever you find.  
---
3. Once you have decided what type of engagements you are after, you'll have to choose fleet composition and fittings.  Here, choice is pretty dizzying (depending on your budget) because you will have to balance between ship mobility, firepower (magnitude and projection), and defense.  Different ship types excel in different balance point you choose.  Also, the number of ships in fleet can put constraints on what balance point is actually viable on the field.  (For example, you have only 5-6 people in your fleet, then you would not want to fight a larger group of similar class ships if your ships are optimized for firepower and defense, since your mobility would suffer and you're likely to be overwhelmed).
---
4. Once you've decided your fleet composition and types of fight you can engage in, you have to decide where in the game world your type of fight may occur likely.  So now your knowledge of different environments and players who dwell or travel there come into play.  
---
5. You actually go to locations you chose, and encounter hostiles.   You have to decide quickly size up the hostile forces and what they are flying and determine whether this is scenario you've planned for, and decide to fight or disengage. 
---
6. During the fight, you have to maneuver ships so that the fight goes along how you planned it:  your ships where they need to be spatially so that they can do what they are supposed to do (apply damage from distance, provide support for other ships in the fleet, immobilize hostile ships, etc.), while denying what hostiles ships are trying to do.  (This is typically what you typically see on YouTube.)
---
7. If you win and hold the field at the end, you get to loot wrecks, since some of components of the ships can be recovered (you can make good money from this).  If you lose, you could either respawn at home base, or spend a good amount of time extracting remainder of your fleet from the combat location, depending on how hard hostiles pursue you.
---
You spend most of your game time and thinking on #1-#5.  #6 really happens in a flash.
---
I would say #6 aspect of EVE is actually not that great.  The game maker has made improvements over years, but a big chunk of player 'skill' is not necessarily absorbing/processing situational information and making tactical decision, but rather struggling with user interface.  
---
For example you have to incessant click on certain buttons because your click is not buffered (you frequently find during fight that your speed boost is not engaged because when you pressed it, it could not activate due to other conflicts).  But you have to know which buttons you can spam, because for other buttons spamming will do something else (like flight towards it).  Certain hot keys will not work if certain windows are active (you could be typing hot keys into one of many chat windows you have), and it's not at obvious which window is active.   EVE UI is not combat-worthy.  Frequently you will find your ship is not doing what you commanded it to do, because of UI clunkiness.  
---
Views leave much to be desired as well.  You cannot get view of your ship, view of hostile ship, and tactical overview simultaneously (you get this even in many games from 90s).  Furthermore, switching between views takes 1-2s because you have to watch transition animation.  This makes steering ship uncessarily difficult.  If you zoom in to make sure you're not commanding the ship so as not to slow down, then you lose sight of tactical picture.  And vice versa.  So expert players become very good at flipping back and forth between different views, and mentally tracking where thing are in between.
---
I'm a pilot in real life, and I can attest that EVE UI would never pass FAA certification.
---
Personally, I put up with #6, because doing #1-#5 is so excellent.
---
Have MBA. Can Confirm.  Fuck that was a waste of time.
---
No amount of stabs allow use of mwd under sctable. The idea of inbuilt stabs sounds good imo.
---
working as intended
---
Well we could advise doing something crazy, like, I don't know....being actual interceptors.
---
However you do it, give them the ability to locate and kill bomber's, even cloaked.
---
Then eve will have it's first true interceptor.
---
I feel the same way about people I've met that just graduated with an MBA lmao.

mix this with my 100km webs on huggin (without links) and we got ourselves a gay-camp
---
I got mine from one of the top schools.  And I agree with you. 
---
Any MBA that ever impressed me would have impressed me without the MBA.  Same goes for anyone I ever knew who went to school in Harvard.  
---
The same does not go for the Marines.  They do change people, almost exclusively for the better.
---
Needs more Quafe
---
Haw guns with small gun tracking would be much better. A new module like siege module for intys that allows them to move faster, gives the damage and tank bonus, and reduces their Sig radius into negatives so damage dealt to them is reflected back to the ship producing it
---
The BBC actually carrying an article about gaming that isn't incredibly negative is the final sign that the Chaos Era is truly here
---
abyssal ECM jams when! i need 120km optimal jams to go with my 110km hugging webs, Lachesis 120km point and mjd battleship

I think you're the exception rather than the rule Ron :-)
---
I didn't know about the solo crayon eating either.  Sounds like Eve though; most of the things being no fun alone but lots of fun when done in a gang.

Is the name from the red rising series? Cool idea. I have been considering doing something similar but I just fucking hate WHs.
---
ARMOR HACS ARMOR HACS ARMOR HAX!!
---
Would be cool if you could deploy this in-game and, depending on how close to the sun you are, it would function like a command burst - a limited, spherical range where fleet members get bursts of capacitor every so often.
---
"I build this ship for minerals I've mined myself so the price of the ship is profits no matter how much I undercut the competition".

I've heard that quote a lot since I started playing but can't find the original source. What was the context of the meme?

Blackout was a fun experiment because ooooo spooky space but space is empty right now. Bring back local or at least have an intelligence array you can anchor to bring it back. Killed within 20 minutes but hey that's someone to shoot (or drop on really). 
---
People ~~won't log in~~ aren't logging in if they can't do what they want. Let's face it a lot of people want to log in, mine and rat to get something they want, push f1 in a fleet and log off. That's fine. We need those people to have targets to hunt. 
---
With blackout still happening, those people are just not logging in. Space is dead. It's been dead for a while but this is really dead. 
---
I loved the idea of blackout when it came out. I was super excited for it, but now that I see what happened to null space, it's just sad.
---
haha BIG IDIOT imagine using your spaceship to pvp xD
---
It's far easier to tell someone else to "harden the fuck up" than it is to moderate yourself and be civil. Am I right or what?
---
you can have lowSP dudes in AC ruptures/scrams.  DPS + Neuting in Ashimu's (actually dont have to be more than 110mil fit each) and exequerers.
---
with about 10dudes upwards you can go 3 exeq, 3, ruptures, 4 ashimu's. generally the ruptures take the grunt of it, and you can survive with your ashimu's and its nice to be a roaming gang and take on a few battleships, marauder, or maybe even standard carrier if 3 exeqs and the dual prop ashi's can tank fine.
---
or you could go down the road of a group of railgun brutix and FC those, again, pretty simple.
---
Cap rails are not gr8.

I recently saw a streamer playing his Loki. He used a fairly standard shield fit. Then he ran into this guy: https://zkillboard.com/character/2112990103/
---
If you check his mails that guy flies Legion all the time and "solo" people with it. On the stream I watched he waited in a DED site cloaked until the streamer came in and tried to do the site. The Loki had no chance against this solo-Legion. I suspect most of his other victims died in a very similar fashion.

---
Wormholes for sure. Found an LP astra in my chain (wh-er btw), did the 1st ref in an attack BC+bomber, seeded and came back after 3 days for the kill. Took about 1 hr of scanning/staging for the final ref plus about 5-6hr afk bashing in total. Wasn’t counting on loot but was pleasantly surprised to have 2 low class ratting BS pop out. About 2B all told.
---
Thank you very much for the charts. When I lived in a non-FW lowsec system, I had something similar, but your plans seem to be much more complete! Gonna give them a try.
---
one of these is important for understanding and not cringing
---
the other is obsoleted on the internet
---
Use it or lose it.
---
I second that. Suitonia is an awesome pilot and great at explaining the fits he uses in detailed fashion and his tactics. He helped me a lot when I was just learning solo PvP.
---
How does Ravenids idea work?
---
Not everyone has their "I'm playing this game" turned on... I know I certainly don't...
---
I'm not saying everyone is playing wow, but it is certainly a high factor in all of this. There are a lot of people going back to playing it...
---
Eve Dead 2019.
---
I see the skill level of both games has increased.
---
Pretty much. Pack up and move on.
---
Idk. Scram immunity, speed buff, and maybe a sig reduction, or a MWD sign bloom reduction.
---
Also, an application bonus in place of any range or dps bonus.
---
Basically make it anti-tackle so they can haul ass out to tackled shit and try to untackle them.
---
I can't say as I don't live there...
---
How has it hindered Nullsec?
---
Upsides - it’s a meetup
---
Downside - its Texas
---
Check out the EVE Discord: [https://discord.gg/d82BBMp](https://discord.gg/d82BBMp)
---
They have a solo PvP channel, in this channel you can find alot of pinned messages which will help you greatly finding tutorials, fits and places to go, they will also happily help you with all your future questions.
---
Ingame you can check out the chat "Bringing Solo Back", but questions can quickly drown in random discussions going on there.
---
Harvester harvests solar shadow
---
Lasers are actually very good. Beam lasers are great if you're kiting or scram-kiting as their optimal range is huge relative to their dps. Less experienced pilots like to shield tank (mid-slots), and add damage modules to their low slots, but they fail to plug their EM hole. Or even if they do, they're still weakest to EM damage.
---
Small corps living unaffiliated in NPC space.
---
CCP should have just left it alone. Just because there was a ton of us doing it doesn't mean there was a problem - the popularity would have waned as corps were getting smarter. Now corps don't have to get smarter because they have a safety bubble. Sigh.
---
So I kinda agree but in the correct context such that:
---
Blackout killed a lot of nullsec ratting / mining &gt;&gt; as a result there are a lot less targets in space &gt;&gt; people are bored b/c they aren't getting their \~\~dank frags &gt;&gt; an opportunity to play something else comes along so everyone jumps ship to go participate
---
They are fine. Assault frigs make them look bad but assault frigs are way too stronk.
---
Thank you CCp
---
Sure, but I am talking about space and activities pretty much unaffected by blackout which would be Wormhole space and Wormhole hunting/ganking. That said I do agree that blackout could very well be a compounding factor.
---
I think the basic concepts of an MBA are all there in Eve.  I'd suggest that industrialist, builders, and market people who are successful in Eve doing their things do have a basic MBA.   I always thought many of the FC's come from the military and ease into the Eve's cat herding very well.
---
everything bugger in texas,
---
even the players
---
Carrier buffs are needed.
---
Spot on, we play it because we want a hard game that gives us fulfilment
---
It's funny how people point to how many are online as to why they don't want to log in and play. It's as if you want every one else to validate your reasons for playing. You also are creating the very thing you are complaining about. Log in, do some thing new then stfu.
---
What about a new probe launcher that has the ability to scan down cloaked ships?
---
You don't think a lack of nullsec targets has an impact on wormhole acctivity?
---
On wormhole PvE activity? I would expect the impact to be marginal.
---
Don't you steal my hat thunder.  I want pirate ones.
---
Just booked now :) shame it's only a one day event. but if it's like Amsterdam there will be alot of tweetfleet activity on the friday night!
---
Holy shit, his kb is so unbelivable. Did you remember if he had neut fitted on ?
---
Because it looks like he killed a macha :  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77912733/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77912733/) 
---
and died some hour later in a fit with no neut :  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77913889/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77913889/) 
---
Anyway, I think I would never bling my ship/pod that much but I'm very interested
---
Capsuleer... err Egg may also be ganked.. shit.. I mean poached.
---
I like all the stupid ideas, here's another one: give them the ability to spawn friendly diamond NPCs
---
Honestly right now it's more of an issue of the types of content being submitted overall. As a team we've made an effort to let positive / productive stuff through (even if its lower quality) vs. the endless circle jerk of "Eve bad". The level of removals in the latter category is pretty high. 
---
For August to date we've had 543 thread removals vs. 354 comment removals.  To put that in perspective - /r/conservative - a subreddit several times the size and far more contentious had just shy of 1000 mod thread removals. Per post r/eve is removing threads at around 1.5x the rate of r/con for August. 
---
This varies dramatically from month to month (some months r/eve has next to no removals). The removals per post isn't anything shocking when you have the full picture and something to compare it to, but it does show that we've been pretty active with content curation at the thread level. This has been a rather slow month as well.
---
The point is it's not so much that I (or any mod) feels the subreddit is in a good or a bad spot. There's just a limit to how much we can push. Some communities are more accepting of direction change than others. R/eve is on the *very* low end of tolerance to that. As of this month we're basically tapped out on what we can do without launching a bunch of stickies / discussions with the sub and what not. Since we've had quite a few of those really it *seems* like the solution is for us to be patient and keep pushing.
---
I can say there has been a very large, positive difference in the subreddit over the last couple of months. It's far from 'there' and still a problem, but relatively speaking there's been a good amount of progress.
---
If your running with a few corp mates you should consider what they are flying. If your not the same tank type you will not be able to refit for link or logi and take on bigger objectives as a team.
---
miserable dps boost, it's only 1 heavy and 1 light fighter
---
Same here. Helped me understand missile flight mechanics way better
---
In my mind, Eve's stealth bombers are the equivalent of real life submarines, not bombers.
---
That's why I started typing out a sentence about how actual interceptors don't hunt bombers before I realized that's exactly what they do.
---
What do you use it for?
---
Something like a bubble/sphere/increased size that decloaked (from a coding standpoint you could do something like give them the decloak size like a titan while keeping the collision model the same) plus combat probe fitting bonus would give it something to do.
---
And it sounds cool.
---
I'll be impressed it eve makes it to 2021
---
What changed for it to disappear?
---
*"OP LEVEL HYDRA"*
---
Nostalgia is a hell of a drug , or at least whatever you're on is a hell of a drug because the Eve of the current day is a wonderland of activities compared to the pre Phoebe duocracy of 2013-14
---
Does anyone know which school to list when adding this MBA to my resume?  I would assume Eve University but I want to make sure, I don't want to look like an idiot.
---
You're so right!
---
Screw that! More chaoses  please!!!! We haven't dropped through the 10k barrier yet
---
It's exactly consistent with an MBA
---
Add s/m/l hardpoint-mounted cap booster chargers.
---
bad bot
---
Possibly.  I wan't here then.  But the recent period in null of VNIs-online was icky.
---
So you will have 6 alts ready to chain point ? Good for you sir.... but I doubt it......
---
I like the stupid ones too.
---
How about giving them the ability to 1 hit KO ships that they warp through like that scene in the last jedi
---
Make them hunters:
---
1. D-scan immunity.
---
2. After breaking a gate cloak, they won't show on anyone's overview or have a frame showing on the ship in space for ~10 seconds. (They can still be ctrl-clicked in space and targeted during that time.)
---
Do interdiction probes deploy instantly? I jumped through a gate last night and there was a Sabre and a kikimora waiting on the other side. I couldn’t warp out in time before the Sabre pilot to dropped a bubble. Just wondering if the animation of the bubble expanded is just for visual effects, like how you are instsntly cloaked and decloack regardless of the animation on your ship.
---
Bonus damage to fighters and lowered sig penalties for mwd?
---
You could make them actually fulfill their eponymous role of intercepting things in the heat of battle by making them more difficult for larger weapon platforms to hit, and giving them better dps specifically against small tackle targets or fighters, bombers, and fibos. Perhaps defender launchers could be a fitting option as well.
---
Don't forget to take a Galmourex Booster to boost standing gain. After a weekend of grinding, you can completely repair any standing by following the faction repair guide
---
IMO, instead of a probe launcher to scan cloaked ships in system, some sort of sensor to find cloaked ships ON GRID, so the interceptor  can then target, approach, and decloak by proximity.
---
Pair it with a bonus to probe warp speed and cycle time
---
So its a deep fake
---
It takes you 20 minutes to get on target? Maybe you *should* look for another playstyle after all.
---
They can still absolutely bump freighters...they just have to suicide someone every &lt;3 minutes to keep them on grid.
---
This attitude makes me want to see that whole group nuked.
---
To the complete shock and surprise of... No one.
---
https://youtu.be/OLx6QCtopTw
---
Obviously not a real Freighter pilot, since you think it's always 1 person with lots of alts doing ganks.
---
There are a few corporations that will have 30 people on standby at all times to gank. Each of them has at least 1 alt they could sacrifice to keep you on grid, meaning they could do it endlessly.
---
Myself see more empty space in highsec, and think they are trying to boost sales numbers.
---
That’s what the fob is for
---
I've always wanted that Asteroid station thing from missions as an actual outpost/citadel structure.
---
How would they be ctrl+clicked if they don't show up lol
---
Its crazy that no one runs l4’s in nullsec outside of burners now.
---
But what if I *like* MRE's?
---
"Measures ARE being taken to entice some others to play in the sandbox the southern front has become however, and I anticipate as pieces of those go into play we will effectively see a slow and continual decline of our enemies pressure as we get over the hump and back onto the offensive but I will certainly make no promises about the timeline for that."
---
So your bat phoning goons, nice TAPI.
---
Why though, that severely limits the number of citadels you can anchor
---
First of all fuck you coward for wanting cloaky ganking playstyle
---
Secondly loki is king for this, arty is strong and versatile and minmitar speed is great , you’ll bring a lot of salt with that
---
hopefully the next one will be called TEST komodo please ignore
---
I think he might be working under the same misconception
---
There's going to be a lot of people saying Loki, and they're wrong. Bonused neuts on a Legion are invaluable. Kspace vs wspace does matter though and how much you're willing to go full commit vs try to be able to escape.
---
Loving AC/100mn/shield/scram loki. ~600 dps, ~ 900 tank heated, that can burn out of grappler. Got my 50th killmark today.
---
Well, that explained Branch NPC Bounties in 2018.
---
Ya, but that's fine. With only a few exceptions (max-tanked JF) if they bring 30 people they can gank and kill you in like 10-15 seconds. CCP can't prevent that from happening, even if they're already on grid. They don't bring a huge force unless there's a huge reason for it, so you suicide pointing with a corvette will bring like 2-3 CONCORD ships, which means nothing.
---
yummy koolaid
---
It should have combat probe fitting bonus and d scan immunity. With the NS blackout these would be amazing.
---
Login incentives stopped
---
Wow classic
---
and the recent changes have chased away an absolute shit ton of casual players , only the “bot farmers” remained mostly.
---
Been talking about this on coms a lot... it’s amazing how many people just let their subs lapse and only come around to be social.
---
It isn’t because it’s too hard, it isn’t because they hate anyone.  It’s just because the changes aren’t fun for anyone but small scale pvpers (which even a lot of those have said the same thing sadly)
---
Yes he did use a neut. The loss mails don't really show how he solos. As you can see he uses a mobile depot to refit in space. That loss mail you linked has related kills. Looks like he blew up a hauler and a dictor right before getting ganked there.
---
Player numbers are down so sales are down.
---
This has been a long time coming.. If you look at the downward trend from Christmas you will see that the recent free SP masking from May onward has now come to it's natural end. Actually we could argue since Alphas, but hard to actually prove it given CCP only allow access to certain data types.
---
-
---
WoW is is just another excuse to add to the already long list of excuses for a dying playerbase due to terrible decisions by CCP. 
---
"it's Summer" 
---
"it's Easter" 
---
"it's Winter"
---
"it's patch week"
---
"it's nearly Summer"
---
"it's nearly Winter"
---
"Russia DDOS"
---
"WoW"
---
There will always be an excuse used by our beloved keyboard white knights who are so far gone, that oxford dictionary now describes "Stockholm Syndrome" as "Eve Capsuleer Turbo Nerds blinded by fanboyism"
---
CCP have acted too late and again proven wrong that a reboot of a game can be huge. CCP Falcon stated that they would never do a Eve 2.0 or reboot the game.. Again more foolish decisions blinded by a sense of authority and arrogance.
---
Including the 99% res?
---
Like why you want to run them if burners give you more ISK for like 1/40 or risk.
---
They have various effects, not just WR, but dverything else in your post checks out.
---
Imagine being grown up and watch cartoons for kids.
---
Jar jar sabre best sabre
---
They just gave/sold all that extra sp over the summer. They are greasing the wheels of monetizing their extration.
---
but blackout totally killed botting and not the real players!
---
This is an honest question, because I don't have a problem with it: How long does it take you to split stacks? Like what is your normal workflow? I split stacks of things all the time using Shift+Drag and I've never really had a problem.
---
it's no real problem to do it once or twice, that's ok, the real problem is to do this a hundred times every day you are doing your pi
---
What wine would you have with this?
---
&gt;a dick move.
---
... And proceeds to call out someone in how they deal with their issues. I'm with you on the first half, don't run around looking for excuses to spout off about what happened to you and how you want people to talk. But fuck off with being a dick about how they deal with it.
---
Yup! each one i've met has been at least 6 foot
---
Those are still resolutions.
---
you are talking about eve players. my main character is eve is older than world of warcraft (live).
---
I just resubbed after a five year hiatus, and I can't recall tbh. I just remember I very recently tried to explain that it didn't work this way to a guy in a public channel when discussing t2 prices (specifically t2 ships) when pointing to the fact that a lot of the market orders where completely out of whack for t2 ships compared to the t2 components you used to build those ships.
---
What is it they want
---
Tbf he didn't say who was taking what measures
---
Got 420 on this god tire shitpost.
---
In all fairness I don't think the black out killed any real players.
---
Broken record
---
You got downvoted but this is the truth
---
After all the “fuck you if you don’t want cloak ganks to be op” game changes the login bonuses were the only reason most of the peoe i’ve talked to even bothered logging in day to day
---
Good for you man! I hope one day I can say the same!

New meta since the fax nerfs is to dual tank your supers.

Fraternity? *Botting?* After Elo's grand crusade against the botting menace to Eve Online? This simply cant be true.
---
The ship is visible in space, but won't have a frame or color on it. You can hold Ctrl and drag a box around it to target it. The idea is that a pod sitting 500 off the gate won't be able to see it before it warps off.
---
Wait, there are special edible crayons?  I've been feeding my guys dollar store brand...
---
I do, but it's still 15 minutes to pull the laptop out / go through the captive portal / hop on VPN / make sure Eve is updated / log in / spin ship a few times / check skills, whereas I can just derp around on the phone and be done.
---
It is sadly common among miners to not consider opportunity cost. They'll mine ore worth 100m if just sold on market unrefined, refine it and build a ship worth 90m. They don't assign a value to their time, skills or equipment, and will defensively state "the minerals I mine are free" if asked about the 10m loss in profit.
---
I think the Loki has a slight edge here.

Maybe my wife will finally accept my eve addiction and think better of me... jk that’ll never happen.

What a scam, soo cheap.
---
I'm against multiboxing a Rorqual fleet; that shouldnt be a thing either... but 1 guy ratting in a carrier or a rattlesnake should not be facing certain death should a gang or hotdrop show up... that is unreasonable risk...  hence... no more rattlesnakes now and after cyno change... no more carriers... as a CSM member some realistic objectively might would be appreciated... since as much as alot of people don't like it... CCP do infact listen to you.
---
They made it so a corporation could toggle whether friendly fire was legal or not. In corp's where it's illegal, friendly fire results in the famous CONCORDOKEN.
---
The Blackout was a reason.
---
Just install a jump clone in the station and pod yourself back to highsec. Then you'll have a little base of operations to return to when you want/need to go back to that area of space.
---
I've got small bases set up all over EVE. When I leave an area, I don't try to get rid of everything. I just leave it knowing that I'll likely wish to return one day.

If anyone can read the original text and see's anything remotely pertaining to real life names / information (Contact names in the screenshots, for example)- please report it and PM modmail ASAP with the section in question.

They are botters anyway.

"Game ~~about shooting others without 'others'~~ is boring."  Eve 2019
---
If you use the "search" tab of the asset window, you can look into the containers via drop-down menu.
---
Don't even have to search for anything, just unfold the relevant stations, then the safety containers.
---
Need more war
---
Vnis online provided a lot of slow targets to train fledgling hunters.  Spinning in a vni was not fun, killing them was.
---
I remember years ago when I first started playing around 2012 being in a corp that was affiliated with another Space Hobos alliance. Or maybe the same as yours. We based out of Gonditsa. Now I'm wondering how that area of space is faring.
---
Immunity to webs. Oh and nerf webs.
---
And tweak scrams so that they have a 1 minute cycle time but only scram the target for 30 seconds. Inties and shit get a bonus to this OFC.
---
Seriously webs are really OP. Even a battleship can track a fast frigate with a heavy web. Close range fights (aka all fights involving tackle) involve ships sitting practically stationary. Boring.
---
He said he was a high school classmate, not that it happened in high school.

Haven't noticed any shortage of others to shoot since the beginning of blackout.

thanks for not killing my sabre yesterday (◕‿◕✿)
---
If you're spending 4-5% of your annual income on a hobby that't definitely not an unhealthy extreme, unless you have like 5 hobbies that you do the same with. I have friends that easily spend $3k a year on green fees alone...put another $3k for apparel/clubs/etc... and you're well past the 4k EVE might cost. I've had months where I spent $900 on EVE. If it's not more than what you can afford and it's not affecting your life, why does the numeric value matter?
---
If I want to spend $30k on a vacation with my family, why is it your business to tell me it's worth it or not?
---
Wait, there's a war?
---
So much for EvE players being on a higher education learning level.
---
I've come to appreciate all those that downvote my one word comments on this sub so they can promote a better sense of joy and optimism instead.
---
Except for grunts like me that do nothing but fight. I'm working on that and training a Rorqual toon. I couldn't have picked a better time.

Confessor in a C2 works, can be iffy of you take a bad approach against larger rats. They also have the benefit of nice align times if you need to GTFO.

I'm going to reserve judgement until a credible source can post a translation.

---
Hey for all of you non believers and general peasants, if you go to Jita you quickly learn that what might be present to you as a "good deal" might not be a good deal at all. 
---
I can also assume that Jita Isk Doublers might have a bright future in some Wall Street firms.
---
&gt; If you understood what you are defending from the perspective of the abused I think you would change your mind.
---
I think it's disgusting that you would attempt to appropriate my pain and suffering to push your agenda on people. Kindly fuck off.
---
I imagine the idea is to let combat intys to rush in to turn off mwd and hold for a little while for others to catch up for retackle and warp out instead of dying.
---
The shadow you can see if ACTUALLY because light was harvested.
---
Come on man, basic physics.
---
Yeah, these graphs should be compared to the same time last year.
---
Is anyone shocked? Will anything be done? Will Elo admit he's being paid with botting money to defend bots and has no problem with it?
---
Magic 8 ball says no.

If it's not Vegas I won't go.

---
This depends *heavily* on fit and I'd be curious to see what you're baselining this statement on.
---
Utopia is *litteraly* the best name for a non existing place.
---
I would like to add that the only qualifications I have are 3 a-levels that spell the word END, Eve is certainly is a top level education.
---
Kind of.  If your hulls warp core strenght is say 2 it takes 2 warp disruptors or 1 warp scram to stop you going to warp. A warp stab raises a hulls core strenght so you would need more points. However bubbles will still apply no matter what.
---
The venture has warp stabilisers inbuilt so you dont need to fit a mod freeing it up the low slot, cpu, grid and cap use for other things.
---
Im advocating the same thing.
---
I wish all the players who are on temporary leave for wow classic a fantastic time filled with nostalgia and I know you will be back in winter for spacepixel action
---
Skin sales will continue until conditions improve
---
THIS. Maybe it wouldn't be Interceptors, since their goal is just to get in quick and stop people from getting away...but some of the scanning ships should have this ability.
---
Why not mix them
---
Yes. If you're on the ball about warping and have a low align time, you can sometimes get off before the Sabre bubbles up. At least with wormholes, you can sometimes have grid loaded a second or so before they get the audio cue of the activation. I think it's the same for gates.
---
Note: Like any strategy for bubble-dodging, it's risky. If you're too slow, you lose precious seconds on a predictable align path (cloakies) and not crashing (non-cloakies).
---
There's no real-life name and info in the original text. Can confirm.
---
Wrong and wrong, but that's fine.
---
No, no, we all have MBAs lmfao.
---
Only misconception I'm seeing here is yours.
---
This is the most disgusting fit I've read in a long time. It's low even for Wingspan
---
He said CTRL+Clicked in space but not Overview.
---
Let them cyno. They are no longer interdiction nullified and it would give players a cheaper option than recons for moving caps. They are also squishy enough that if you use them to drop on someone they can quickly kill the Cyno if the Cyno is too close. They are cheap enough that in big fleet fights and escalations you can send swarms of them to cyno until one of them sticks while also being a fun "space invaders" minigame for the defenders trying to pop cynos before the caps can jump to them.
---
Update: They just got permbanned. All of them. Yup. https://www.eveonline.com/article/pwp24p/monthly-security-report-july-2019
---
Thanks! Never used the feature before. 
---
Still more annoying than just Selecting call and fireselling to the new station occupants lol.
---
Hopefully the hurricane won't interfere with my asset gathering this weekend.
---
The D-scanner should make a chirp every time you manually fire it off. It doesn't rescan on its own unless you change sessions (e.g. jump or undock).
---
I know the silhouettes you're talking about, but I have no idea what rules they follow.
---
I take it as a complement.
---
I fly the Legion a lot but it also fit mainly for straight up dps for hit and run tactics. Only bad thing is it that it’s kinda bulky when it comes to maneuvering.
---
Have you ever pressed ctrl+f9? Even cruisers are almost invisible unless they're right next to you and you zoom in all the way
---
Imho, WoW classic is charming not because of nostalgia but because its \*fun\* playing a real ***RPG*** again.
---
MMO ***RPGs*** which are supposed to have a sense of progression. Talents, skills, gear, leveling, all of it creates a real sense of attachment and achievement. 
---
EVE used to have progression too, you went from frigates to ceptors, to dictors, to cruisers and maybe HACs, to battlecruisers and battleships, and if you were really dedicated you got into capitals. That sense of progression is what made all the losses from ganks, and pvp worthwhile.
---
For some of us, capitals were the carrot on the end of the beating stick that is EVE. And now? Injectors have destroyed any sense of progression with people injecting straight into end-game, and now 'chaos' is turning the carrot into ashes.
---
Now it's been a while, but I played with one of the major overhaul mods, think it was XRM? New ships, weapon rebalance, good stuff. There's also a mod for building station complexes more easily, and a bunch of others that I honestly can't remember. I had found a dude from the forums who had a google docs(?) page with most mods ever released for x3tc but I'm not sure what I did with the link.
---
Fleet interceptors are already fantastic tacklers, I don't see how giving Claws warp stability would make them better in any way
---
Ya I get that - I'm just curious about what your workflow looks like. Like can you break down what you do when you're doing PI for a minute? How/why do you split things and how many splits do you do?
---
Haha just reading that now actually. Really great. Originally in my mind was from the Hell Divers series, sort of similar concept though I guess
---
Really? Eve in c2 anoms in a Tengu I find I can get overwhelmed and need to warp off time to time . I don’t see T3 destroyers used much, pretty cool! What kind of ehp and dps can you get out of it?
---
Vanishing if controllable

---
Nice attempt at a cover-up. 5/10 almost believe you no bots in Frat.
---
At least they aren't blue to goons/test, like I would rather have the lesser evil of botting in frat than another castrated alliance.
---
Rep bonus along with sig radius reduction so they can stay on grid longer
---
The reason for this is that I bought some only a few days ago, so the sale had to start after that
---
Combat ceptors are my favorite class, I have more than 1k solo kills in Crusader. There're multiple ways to fix them, out of those i like - two easy and one rather complex.
---
1) Sturdy and fast scrambling ships for interception and tackling
---
Take away LR point cap bonus, give them 25-50% scram range bonus and take it away from fleet ceptors to give those ships distinct roles. Give them a little more facetank and some ewar resistance (some kind of permanent or temporary scram/web/neut resistance - any combination of them, depending on strength). Nerf ramjag because it effectively just takes away this role. Ceptors should be faster than ramjag, but at the same time easier to kill if you can apply to them (and harder if you cannot, thanks to scram/web/neut resistance).
---
2) Lightning-fast close-range antifrigate ships
---
Take away LR point cap bonus, give them same 25-50% scram range bonus and take it away from fleet ceptors. Give them special damage mod which is fittable only to combat ceptors, takes good chunk of fitting but gives alot of damage and speed. Their final speed should be at least 30% higher than speed of fleet ceptors in full mobility fit and their damage should be outstanding to kill fleet ceptors fast. To compensate for that, they should have very low tank once they reach scram range and stop to apply their dps, so that despite good dps output they lose fights vs navy frigs which are slower, but are fit for face-to-face combat (and lose or have equal chances vs t1 frigs like merlin). To not allow tanky fits, their base stats should be quite mediocre, and vast amount of their mobility and dps output should come from that special damage mod which takes low slots and thus prevents fitting armor tank via taking lows and prevents fitting shield tank by taking away PG (and thus forcing ships like raptor to use at least one auxiliary power control to have MSE, taking away one low slot).
---
To have this role, they have to be more effective at killing frigates than other ships, including cruisers (like RLML ships a-la cerb), hence necessity to have superb speed and damage.
---
3) Rework weapon application mechanics so that damage-dealing frigates are needed even in bigger fights
---
All damage-dealing frigates suffer from the same common issue: they are weak compared to bigger ships (capital^W cruiser/BC proliferation in subcap meta). Their guns are weak and short-range for them to matter (with few notable exceptions a-la kikimora, retribution, jackdaw, cormorant - all of them can project which is important for fleet fights). Frigates' biggest advantage - accuracy - is not usable in fleet fights due to how damage application works in eve, and due to abundance of methods to apply damage (LR webs/TPs). You better bring cruisers/BCs and have no damage-dealing frigates at all if you are going to fight for some objective.
---
For this to change, fights have to be "split" into several layers. It has several negative implications for EVE, but it has some positive too - it gives damage-dealing frigates a place in bigger fights, for example because bigger ships would be unable to deal with bombers without frigates' help.
---
Guns: there're two parameters presently, tracking and optimalSigRadius. Presently they are just multipliers of each other and CCP effectively got rid of optimalSigRadius by normalizing it to 40k on all guns. However, gun application formula could be changed this way:
---
- tracking would become real tracking, how fast gun barrel can turn. You either track (can hit) or you do not (cannot hit at all).
---
- optimalSigRadius becomes "gun accuracy". 1400mm arty can hit tiny ceptor which sits still 10k away from it, but the bigger the range - the higher projectile devitation, so at 200k chance to hit interceptor would be, say, 5%, but can hit battleship with 100% chance because its surface is still bigger than projectile deviation. No exact formulas, but chance should be function of range to target, optimalSigRadius (aka gun's accuracy factor) and target signature radius.
---
This way smaller ships have a way to survive in close-range by outtracking and in long-range due to natural projectile/beam deviation. Webs help with tracking factor but do not help with accuracy factor. TPs help with accuracy factor but do not help with tracking factor. This resolves one quite irrational thing which always bothered me in EVE, "the further the range the better hits are", up to extent of my tach oracle decimating frigs which are 200k away.
---
(as a side-note, using singature radius for accuracy factor is quite irrational too, because it should be physical ship size which decides if projectile hits or not, and TPs do not change physical size of any ship; but I don't know how else do I make TPs useful for guns)
---
Missiles are fine as-is, i guess. Maybe rapid launchers should be reworked so that they apply less dps to smaller targets one way or another.
---
This way you will need destroyers (accurate LR guns, but subceptible to cruise gun/missile fire) or frigates (accurate close-to-mid range guns) to deal with bombers, and small guns could find their place even in fleet meta.
---
I went to undergrad for engineering and got pointed in the MBA direction as a way to get a different set of skills.  Most of what we talked either felt like common sense or stuff I already knew from elsewhere.  At least work paid for it though and I got another fancy piece of paper out of it.  Maybe it will come it handy one day.
---
Ah I figured with  Outer Rim in there it would be related to red rising. Hell Divers looks interesting though I'll add that to my list.
---
Have you thought about the tengu? I'm guessing you've not skilled up to it
---
What a fuckin' legend....
---
well the final goal of both do seem to be churning out  paperpushers after all
---
Thanks to everyone answering and helping a newbie. As I heard Eve Community is awesome. I can confirm now!
---
Have a great weekend guys &lt;3
---
Wait, you're telling me that an alliance run by an RMTer, who got on the Alltime Top Botters chart in a matter of months, recruits a leadership team who encourage botting and breaking the EULA?
---
:shocked pikachu:
---
I actually can't wait for these implants to hit TQ
---
An attitude like that justifies to nuke any group.
---
Yea maybe a real world example would help explain to them like: You work for 5 hours and I pay you in gold worth 100 dollars, now you take the gold and make a ring that is sold for 90 dollars. Did you make a 90 dollar profit or a 10 dollar deficit?
---
suggested pairing: bleach
---
I wonder I wonder, if it would be possible to scroll up in your chat to a previous day, what amazing time travel that would be.
---
This how sad the game has become and how irrelevant titans now are.  Not one bit of excitement when they a friggin Vanquisher.  I remember a time we cheered at killing a titan now its Meh
---
.

Where the fuck as the awe gone In this game. Where??!!

Considering the reviews I've heard from almost everyone that's played WoW classic that I've talked to, it's been "Wow!! Nostalgia!!! This is great!!!!!" shortly followed by "Wow! We've come so far and classic *really* did not age well. Really makes you appreciate all the QoL improvements WoW has now, this is barely even playable!"
---
I mean, if you have anything logical to talk about?
---
I am pointing out some concerns I had about the legitimacy of the so called "proof", and so far I don't see any valid counter point to address my concerns.
---
After all, you can change your nick name as you like on QQ and this whole thing is too easy to fabricate. If you want throw accusation I expect something better that that.
---
I can see that to a degree, but eve bomber's are far more agile and evasive than a sub and have a single antiship weapon system (typically). They typically do not hunt in groups of 20+. Aircraft is far more apt in my opinion, but again it's just that.
---
I'm pretty down with that name

I think epsilon is leaking again.

---
I don't recall the stats off hand.
---
vindicator dread fax is a dank 3 account combo
---
imagine how many retards you could kill with that before the neckbeards mobilize their girthy bulk and actually bring a super to kill you 
---
better yet imagine how many recons you'll roast after cynoy changes
---
eh.....i guess the log shows everything already
---
You know that timestamps roll over after midnight every day, right?
---
That's just what a bot would say.
---
shockedpicachuface.jpg
---
lmao jk
---
&gt;The cost of force recons on the ISK scale of a large cap fight is negligible
---
Cost or skills have nothing to do with it.  EHP does.  The cyno will be destroyed immediately, even if it's a tanked-as-much-as-you-possibly-can BLOPs.  After all, the grid is full of hostile supers.
---
We have experience with this via cyno interceptors.  During large cap battles, you need to bubble your own fleet because of all the crashes and disconnects - you can't let your ships e-warp or they get scanned down and die (e-warped ships are treated as if they are unfit, with a zero-SP pilot).
---
Which means the opposing fleet needs to use interceptors to place their cynos where they need them.  The interceptor dies almost instantly, but you can frequently enough get 1-5 caps through to the interceptor's cyno.  Those caps then light their own cyno and you get the rest of the fleet through.
---
If those caps can't have cynos, then you just have 1-5 dead caps.
---
And you'll need to note that bubble problem - recons and blops aren't bubble immune, so now you can only place the cyno at 0 on the opposing fleet.  Which is not what you want in these big titan battles.
---
And before you try to argue "use cloaks!!", cap balls are dense.  The recon/blops/t3 will be within 2000m of something.
---
And before you try to argue "use interceptors for a warp-in!", you're broadcasting to the opposing supers where the cyno will be when the blops lands, making it even easier and faster for them to kill your cyno.
---
&gt;Once TiDi is in place the number of people from outside of Tidi who should manage to jump to the cyno before it dies should be decent.
---
This is not even remotely true.
---
When the node gets full enough that you hit lots of TiDi, the cyno doesn't appear on "jump to" menu very quickly.  Even though it's up in the game, and the cyno ship can be shot.
---
Also, when you do hit "jump", there's a good chance you won't actually jump on the first try.  Or second.  Frequently takes about 4 tries.  But if you spam jump too quickly while trying to do this the client gets put into a bad state and you're screwed for a few minutes until it comes back to its senses.  Which works when you're jumping to a cap (and other caps did get through).  Doesn't work when you're jumping to a subcap on a grid with enemy supers, 'cause it's dead long before your client is back to normal.
---
=/
---
basically I'm preparing in station splitting for hauler size stuff, then adding one stack of any of them putting stuff into my hauler (enough Mats for 3 pocos), in warp I'm splitting them up (sometimes fast enough sometimes not), dropping in pocos, rinse and repeat
---
once again, proof that China should always be regionlocked
---
how do you farm 2bil without botting easy broken knee caps and domi 13 hours a day trust me i done it
---
why do you want to cram sweaty unwashed neckbeards into a conference room where it's already hot?

do you hate your nose?

In terms of being a waste of hull, mwd arty can be rivaled only by 10ab xlsb.

Why a day after I extracted my alts SP
---
What the hell are you talking about? Go check SiSi, that's a purely esthetic upgrade.
---
Are you shocked after PL moved into the region?
---
This is going to keep happening. Frat call in PanFam, TEST call in Goons, there's a scuffle and then Goons and PL fuck off for a while and TEST go back to farming Frat. Rinse and repeat every few months. 
---
We're on year 2 of this already.
---
No they would have a combat timer preventing them from logging out. They warp to deadspace making the gank much easier.
---
Well, its the third quarter, but whatever.
---
Mind sharing your kb?
---
humanity survived for thousands of years without plumbing, just go to the designated shitting street
---
Yea and that wont be abused at ALL by botters right?
---
I did that what you described, with 2 accounts, so with 3 it is convenient. Also props OP for considering high sec PvP, where the fun is at.
---
Let us suppose that a frequent route between hubs is A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D, and D is a 0.5 or 0.6. What I used to do is to have a scanner alt in B on the A gate, and passive cargo and ship scanned all t1 industrials. Ship scan is useful to identify ships with too many WCSs and to check for possible overtank in for example 0.7 systems (where you can kill the non-tanky t1 hauler but usually not the tankier variant).
---
Ganker is in D on gate C, looter is at a perch watching the same gate. Looter is either something disposable (I used a WCSd Nereus) or you can try for example a BR too.
---
If you don't have that many systems, you can place your scanner alt in C on the B gate, and do the same. I used +1 system in the chain because I used 2 accounts, and I had to log off the scanner and log in the looter all the time, and this process needed some extra time.
---
My Vexor fit that I used is the following:
---
    [Vexor, Vexor]
---
    Damage Control II
---
    Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
    Magnetic Field Stabilizer II
---
    
---
    Initiated Compact Warp Disruptor
---
    Large Shield Extender II
---
    250mm Prototype Gauss Gun,Caldari Navy Antimatter Charge M
---
    Medium Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I
---
    Medium Anti-Thermal Screen Reinforcer I
---
    Medium Processor Overclocking Unit I
---
    Curator II x4
---
Other, low-skill choices are Thoraxes, Moas and for example Mallers, these ships require skills only in one weapon system, unlike the Vexor.
---
Make sure to buy up your sec status via tags when it dips below 2.0, NPCs harrassing you on the gate is nasty.
---
hai
---
Wait wait, really? I did not know that. May have to check it out.
---
You need to update your flare
---
I don't know that I'd call that fit a "fairly standard" for the type of target someone ganking will run into. Maybe in reading into what OP was saying, but if you're solo ganking it's usually not PVP ships.
---
Funny enough I've never been scammed by an isk doubler. They always double my isk.
---
d r a m a  t a x
---
ugh can you imagine a fozzieclaw fleet under blackout conditions
---
 You can cloak up on grid and detach your camera from your ship, zoom around whatever.
---
We've had 5 or 6 different people confirm the translation. Some confirmed in this thread. Doesn't mean that the content is legitimate, just that the translation is accurate.
---
Give both types of ceptor modes like tactical destroyers.
---
Both get a travel/propulsion mode which turns on nullification but reduces max targets to zero (even with an auto-targetter).
---
Combat ceptors get a combat mode that increases stats like damage, tank, etc
---
Fleet ceptors get a scout mode that increases d-scan range
---
Incoming hundreds of camera alts at every gate, major station, etc.
---
Theres always one miserable sod isnt there that hasnt to just look at the downside of things.  My god you must be a barrel of laughs
---
Hmm unsure if this is supposed to be a joke. Can you clarify? Do you actually play eve?
---
Content evictions
---
Not really. Hunted for 2 hours and nada.
---
&gt;Maybe Also a utility high with ship bonuses to fit a combat probe scanner and bonuses to combat scanning.
---
One of the big problems balancing these ships is not taking away a role for other ships.  Here, you take away a role for covops.
---
Make it do more damage?  That's bomber/AF territory.
---
So, it would probably be better to invent a new role for them instead of shoving them into another ship's role.  How 'bout a damage/tackle bonus to fighters and some sort of defense against tackle?  It would let them "intercept" things.
---
Idk if it can do millions but i've been on a test with 30k, there was no substantial lag and most of it was client side, they are also running on amazon servers atm so it's not the most powerful one, now imagine 30k characters in one system in eve, you are free to believe what you want but I have access to it and know how it looks like in reality, they are also keeping up with their [roadmap](https://www.dualthegame.com/en/news/2018/08/08/release-roadmap-alpha-launch-announcement/) and the game is in alpha 2 atm, Idk, it might be a scam but if it is they are putting a lot of effort into actually developing the game and afaik I already got my money's worth in form of play time. Even as it is it's more complex than eve
---
Yes. We used to see over 20k logged on during the week. At least when the bots were around I had something to shoot at.
---
What are you on about.  Theres a gazillion alts now cloaked up stop being so friggin stupid and dumb
---
Plex tanking has become obsolete.
---
My english must be bad, because you didn't understand anything. 
---
But thanks for the salt.
---
Take a combat probing t1 dessie, probe down battleships in invasion systems, and profit. Some people will have catalysts ready to suicide gank, though, so don't keep all the loot on your ship, drop a depot or something
---
eve last vegas will be fun
---
Reversed propulsion
---
Clearly you dont or you wouldnt ask such a mindless question.
---
Also, there is a few thousand people who have supported it, all under nda where you'd lose access to the game if you broke it, why do you think no one broke it so far?
---
Did you get a titan before your knees healed?
---
oh great... so i can just drop out of school then?
---
At least you need an alt in space.
---
Make your own video content then?
---
Thank you for your feedback.
---
I need to make a few nuances:
---
&gt; Last thing to add, you say "ive worked in the business for 20 years" and "250mill dollars is a shit load of money". If you really worked in the AAA game business, you would know that 250mill isn't actually quite alot and that they managed to keep developing for over 8 years solely on that budget with a huge team is actually quite impressive
---
I did in fact work in the software industry. We did not make games [there’s absolutely nothing wrong with games, obviously], but that is not what we did.
---
I mentioned my experience in how we developed our products. First we have the MRD [Marketing Requirement Document] which informs product management of required features and is the document where developers are going to work with to build the features they want in the product.
---
We were a publicly traded company which means there are hard deadlines with regards to generating revenue. The people with the long job description titles were quite serious about that.
---
$250 million dollars is a lot of money, but I understand that AAA titles will spend that money easily. However, for that money a lot of features can be built into the experience. It’s not as if it’s a fleck of dust on a suit, right?
---
With regards to timing I’m still convinced that 9 years now is a lot of time to wait for a game. It’s still in early Alpha. Back in the day of the early kickstart, they had a game in mind that they wanted a budget for. For that money they wanted to build a game. Then they were hit by a tsunami of money and they acquired ambition. They did not build the game they had in mind. If they did, that would have been the first iteration. Something for the players to engage with.
---
Now they have far greater ambitions that they need to build a vastly more complex product for. It’s been 9 years now. I don’t know how many backers they have but I’m fully expecting some of them to start dying without ever having seen the completed game.
---
I’ve seen some of the things they want to do, one of them was the salvaging mission. I don’t know whether that’s still a thing. As I understand it multiple people will be flying in the same ship and the goal will be to salvage destroyed ships and other loot. I have some reservations about that as a gaming experience.
---
So, you’re clearly not expecting a release this decade [what’s left of it], what would you consider a proper time where ‘I think it’s about time they released it’?
---
I don’t know whether it’s a game for me but I can only applaud a well-made game with lots of fantastic features to explore and use.
---
Because as we all know, CCP listen closely and act when we give them incredibly obvious bots in an attempt to make their jobs easier.
---
dank leak, [how shocking!](https://imgur.com/a/FOd555n)

That's the point duh!  The posts in here must be from 12 year olds.

Tbh, at this moment all leaders of the major nullsec entities would have to step down. Legacy had KWG and now Mangos, GotG harbours an alliance that is literally just there to hold bots (Gemini Whale United), FRT managed to be top 3 botting group in under 2 years. And the wikileaks-moment for Imperium will also come, be assured of that ;-P ...

ANOTHER VANQUISHER DOWN FROM THE SAME PILOT. GF THE THERAPISTS****

better?

No, you see, he wasn't on a crusade against botting. He only posted about "Goon rorqual bots." While I won't bother with the tired "the other kinds of botting must have been okay by him hurr durr" rejoinder, I will accuse the man of not giving a shit about the botting itself, but more about the identity of the people he perceived as being naughty.
---
And...... are you missing the whole point here or just trolling..

No spod :/

is this satire or something

there's already exactiy what you're asking for. it's the tactical camera

are you really this retarded?
---
Also also, afaik it's not on a single node, it's more like being able to divide 1 node into multiple ones on the go thus spreading the load across multiple servers without restarting the game server, it is also written in 64 bit architecture which allows WAY more resources to be used than what eve has with 32 bit architecture

It's logical for a neutral view to doubt something like this, but in this game, and community, once the word "bot" gets thrown out you're guilty even if proven innocent.  Just drop it and let the witch hunt blow by, or the bans fly.

A more simple solution would be a replay system no? Records your grid and UI toggleable. Nothing you couldn't see in game would show up.

Also limits citadels to only the lower quality moons. I mean, who's gonna put a citadel on an R32 or r64 anyway?
---
Most systems have more than 5 planets anyway. We don't want to encourage excessive citadel spam now, would we?
---
Go to NPC Delve. Kill goonie goons

Hope they'll make changes so you can't farm isk in supercaps/titans any more. At least not any amounts that make it worth using them over a battleship.

Ha! I spent the day in one yesterday mapping it out. It had 60+ connections. I've been in wormholes for about 4 years and never seen that many connections, had to see it on the mapper. XD
---
I guess thats all what was left in your brain -.- ...
---
It’s a trade off between placing a athanor/tatara or another citadel. But I guess I can understand a restriction of non refinery citadels to planets. It’s just very restrictive on the number, whereas planets and moons still allows you to place a large amount of citadels in a system.
---
At first I thought blackout would make people to cooperate more, but you're totally right. People even stopped reporting on intel. Intel discusions are on the rise since people report blue ships all the time. There are less roamers, and hunters reduced to bombers and t3c cloacked all day long and only uncloacking on easy targets they can pop in a matter of seconds just so they can cloack again and go missing for a few hours. The game is turning pretty boring at this point.
---
i think he's saying that making an alt to be cloaked in space, requiere time, skills and isk. Having hidden eyes cost "a little" and can be destroyed, forcing player to care of it. 
---
Giving everyone an unkillable alt without costing time or isk will break that system at a huge scale.

I never did say that XiX was the sole botting entity. I have given shit to the previous botting empires for allowing that shit. Botters will continue to bot, but when your alliance doesn't give a shit about them, YOU ARE complicit to botting. Why exactly is XiX getting a free pass over Hard Knocks Associates or PIBC? Now I remember, they are not giving isk to TEST/Legacy.

---
You can center your camera on different players using the look at command.
---
 YouTube videos are zoomed out because the people that watch them are more interested in seeing the whole field than visuals of one ship. And most experienced players play zoomed out anyways.
---
Actually no.
---
It’s same cuz both work as jump limit. It’s kinda different, but kinda same.
---
You have to know everyone can’t jump in same cyno in 1 tick in fights, cuz many of them are multiboxed alts and latency issue, or just slow hand blah blah...
---
Anyway, put this in your mind, everyone can’t jump at 1 cyno in a sec. It can in theory, but no. (tbh You must try it to feel this. I also didn’t understood before I tried to do it myself in big fight) 
---
As I said we can use multiple cyno ship, and it will be meta after patch, but making and coordinating 30~40 recon ships get ready is really painful, dumb, and boring so it will prevent capital escalation after patch for sure.
---
Also 15 man leshak fleet was just example for ordinary wh fleet.
---
Okay, but everyone is complaining about citadel spam... Best not perpetuate the problem. Also systems with large amount of planets could then become content drivers, being very desirable, groups would have reasons for fighting for sov control.
---
Truly, what prompted me not to take your word salad more seriously was what you said.
---
15% is nothing, I miss the greenman gaming deal in december that was at 67% or something.
---
You need to go through your fitted ships.  If you have any double bubble dictors they are worth a lot of isk.
---
hi
---
All I know is lowsec has gotten so inactive even I'm struggling to log on because there's no content
---
Man I was just high up enough in init to know that our poor diplos and rental nerds spent a lot of time chasing bots. The rise of alphas mean that vnis (or now vexors or myrms or even domis) and who knows what else accounts just get run blatantly and when one gets popped you run up a new one. Bot to plex, and then keep botting till it gets zapped when you just roll a new one.
---
INIT spent a lot of time on purging just our renters, and we had some member corps who got told to check certain nerds who either had jobs where they could remote desktop or no job at all so they were going 16+hours a day. The problem is that CCP shows off those flashy ban counts, but with alphas plex and injectors theres no real loss if you drain your bots wallet often enough. And we both know goons have caught plenty of botters on their own.
---
Bonus damage vs. drones would be both unique and useful in small gangs/fleets
---
You can do stuff in paint or something?
---
Is that a fulltime job,going to reddit 24/7 trying to suppress anything not in your narrative? Can you live of it ?
---
Let me correct that title - "If you're playing EVE Online and managing a huge coalition you basically already have an MBA, otherwise you're no smarter than a preschooler"...
---
It's Delve.
---
Assuming you haven't managed to get yourself blacklisted, join Karmafleet.  Get your stuff out with their help.  Then either stay or go depending on what you want to do next.
---
(You might want to stay a little to shake the rust off and learn what changed in those 10 years)
---
I hadn’t really thought about it like that, I agree with this
---
Ccplz ban caps in fw space
---
I've always wondered at the fact that powerful players up near the top of the EVE food chain are happy to keep going when the game is clearly so stagnant and lifeless.. the only answer that comes to me consistently and sticks over time is 'they're making a living off it'.
---
CCPLS lets us extract in EvE Online and inject in EvE Echoes which by the way is hella fun.
---
My loki fit has +80 GJ/s and reps 3k EHP. Also, 38.8% cap warfare resistance. 
---
You need like 4 legions to neut that out. 
---
Or, 4 DPS legions to break the tank.
---
Indeed. Wormholes are the only legitimate way to play eve according to r/eve. News at 11.
---
Removed.    
---
But you get the idea now what i hunt for.
---
Loki,vanilla, mayonnaise, McDonald's,oatmeal,(insert generic thing here) ad infinite items.
---
If it's in Dallas then I'll be there. With some Shiner beer and cigars. Also a few guns in case any commies try to cramp our style.
---
Reading this stuff is so neat. Eve is so mysterious to me.
---
Still don't see how people have been getting away with that considering it's technically an exploit. 
---
&gt; We would like to clarify that **all** methods of delaying Concord's response time are considered an exploit. 
---
It's almost like they selectively enforce their own rules.
---
For idiots like me to talk with you here?
---
Possible
---
sorry i'm bad at charts, but what is the difference between chart 2 ad 3 ?
---
I'd stay out of Merica if I were an EvE dev or literally just a human being with all the daily massacres you guys have there... probably the reason they left...
---
&gt;So your bat phoning goons, nice TAPI.
---
One side batphones, the other side batphones later in response, the first sides batphone gets salty.
---
You have to ping harder, my initial post now is positive despite your early efforts XD ... your pathetic and hilariously to watch at the same time
---
I don't touch the dumb karma arrows. Karma is worthless, especially since the forum doesn't actually tell you the truth about the numbers. Don't obsess over fake internet points, son.
---
Not quite at op level Elmo, but close.
---
so now we care about some random big black c le sigh
---
I bet the moon landing was fake and vaccines give you autism too!
---
What the actual fuck are you talking about?
---
No thanks, not interested in extracting my alts. Not interested in playing them either in the age of ~~Hilmar Doesn't Know What He Is Doing~~  Chaos.
---
Yes, actually. We were pretty suprised PL had enough actives to do...well....anything really.
---
Mark my words Mr Zap
---
If you seriously thinking the players unsubbing are disproportionately bots, you will need to back up your claim.
---
Can confirm. Became an accountant just from playing EVE. I'm not even particularly good at it either!
---
Show me on the Harvester where the Olmeca touched you.
---
I will enjoy the return of the banter when your sacrifice is completed
---
Sounds very fun, thank you for sharing :)
---
Nice try troll,
---
maybe supers and titans but not dreads and carriers?
---
this is my favorite cocktail
---
for some reason people keep giving me weird looks when I ask for the Jonestown
---
3 is relative change
---
Oof
---
Many people here would say you shouldn't get any of your stuff back, and that asset safety should not be a thing.
---
Someone actually downvoted me
---
They know nuffink
---
Yes, and as an adult i can spend my own money on a person sized hug pillow with lewd anime snakegirl print on it.
---
Inb4 skills get tied to clones to prevent fast JC'ing to dread alts.
---
instead of getting tilted you should read through the lines, what you’re asking for is already available with the various camera modes, and ships with cloaks.
---
No it's not intersting at all.  It's awful.   Yiu simply dont get what I mean. Stop posting
---
I guess we have a winner.
---
Bumping gives combat timer?
---
Hey my mom loves bbc
---
3kehp/sec ?! Holy ! What is your fit + pod like ? 20b ?
---
The problem is it hasn't touched me. I'm totally into self absorbed people.
---
I find that playing Eve makes me far less likely to trust IRL... Sometimes that's useful.
---
 usually, thats right, but I still want to be able to manage pvp ships, of course against a 2b loki+pod I don't expect to win...
---
Sadly we are "Adjust or die"'ing each other out of the game. The average vet are family men and women now.....walking away is getting easier. Sad but true.
---
I don't understand how people can actually think this way, but thanks for clearing it up.
---
I'd assumed it was just an in-joke that someone fell for once.
---
tengu looks sexy, but everybody say it's shit in PVP... It is not ?
---
When things get slow there's lots of opportunities for people.
---
ISK Doubler exposed
---
&gt; same cyno in 1 tick 
---
Good because it takes now than 1 tick to kill it too.
---
It definitely won't take 30-40 recons. That's nonsensical to even claim.
---
Anyway... I think your idea is a great way to change citadels
---
Grr
---
IF they dont know how would i?
---
The fact that regions with heavy bot presence no longer had those characters in space, proves there is a huge chunk of bots, who no longer boost the concurrent online player numbers. Hoe many the bits were/are? Only CCP has a clear idea.
---
If you think there wasn't a huge number of bots who stopped 'playing' after Blackout, you have some serious intellectual issues and limited mental capabilities.
---
Eve and smoke blowing up asses. The game sucks and is easy.
---
I guess you don't hive wife or a girl then.       
---
Substitutes .....
---
Being zoomed out the whole time has little to do with being cloaked on a perch or anything like that.
---
Making good angles on an in-progress fight is inherently difficult, since you don't know whats going to happen until it does. Cinematic angles do not make the best views for situational awareness. Definitely s big issue for someone recording themselves in the action. 
---
The bigger issue is likely the lame camera we have. It does what it needs to for the most part, but I sure as hell wouldn't describe it as versatile.
---
Back in my day *pulls on belt buckle* we farmed for hours while stoned put of our minds to stay ahead of the game I tell you wat
---
That's the shit I want to read on this sub, thanks for that post. 
---
Good shit
---
You did singled out XiX in your comment implying that they supportive of botting, due to history of botting in their rental alliance, all i did was point out that the other rental alliances had similar metrics of banned accounts in CCP Peligro Pie chart, the only alliance that gave people a bit of a shock was Fraternity rental alliance, who despite being newer than most of the other ones in his pie chart, still managed to get enough attention from CCP to have about half as many banned accounts as Brothers of Tangra, a much older rental alliance from NC.
---
Also its pretty funny that you are saying "why is XiX getting a free pass over Hard Knocks or PIBC" 
---
XiX didn't get a free Pass, the HRE did, in general, the complaints about botting in the drone regions stopped showing up on reddit after the DRF collapsed and evicted, but prior to the war, and during the war, there were threads complaining about bots, constantly, and they were all pointing the fingers at XiX and their rental empire, mysteriously the complaints stopped, despite the fact that botting continue in the drone regions, but under a different land lord.
---
10 rorqual alts != real players big boy
---
It'd be nice if we could use stuff like that to customize our structures. It would make things feel more alive. You can't even put structures in the random locations where these objects exist in space either, since you have to anchor 100km away. Sucks.

Can I mine it in my Rorq?

---
AAR: We had eyes on a nyx tethered on an anthanor guarding a Rorqual in the nearby moon belt as well as another rorqual in the system's ice belt.
---
One of the reasons pilots tether a carrier on anthanors while moon mining is so they can send out their fighters to handle any rat spawns that can pop their excavators. However, when a carrier's fighters are out, the carrier is de-tethered. This is especially dangerous since the belt is over 150 km away so it would take a "while" for the fighters to return to the carrier to haze any tackle.
---
Once this nyx committed his fighters to rats in the moon belt, we tackled with a HIC and cyno'ed in a nightmare and dread fleet next door and gated in. Meanwhile, we tackled both rorquals and popped them both shortly after the nyx.
---
We had a good time, hope you enjoy watching!
---
But, are there baguettes?
---
Hey, watch what you say about Karma, they're your best corp!
---
"Outfoxing" is in quotes because of how idiotic it is to warp around a system in a jump freighter, right?
---
its more of a play on our corp name
---
I just yesterday yelled out my window at some moron in a Jeep. He was driving like an idiot. Had Marine stickers all over it.
---
"Guess you really are a Marine, dipshit! Get off the road and eat another crayon dumbass!"
---
what did i just post in the ddfc channel then if you have access to command channel :thonking:
---
Maybe if they combine a built in FPS ... with First/3rd Person walking planetside/in station/on ships... but omg CCP is lazy as fuck... so no... game will fizzle out after enough dog shit changes
---
We've stole an empty hel from pos without field and used it to reinforce another pos with empty nyx on it within the same system. Fuck citadels...
---
i could have so many nergals with that isk..
---
*shit*
---
The eye roll when the new private fresh out of boot asks if he can bring his Drake.
---
I’m 6’7” and from Texas. Checks out.
---
You think they don’t?
---
From what I've heard the other t3cs are more geared for fleet pvp while the tengu is more of a cloaky Hunter, I'm not an expert though so take this with a grain of salt.
---
This
---
From the corp ?
---
Most likely :p
---
Sorry to be this guy but WTF did you think was gonna happen? Used to be like walking down a hallway with everyone’s doors open and people doing all kinds of shit. You could poke your head in and chat or join. 
---
Then Hilmar made of close all the doors and no one understood that you wouldn’t be able to see your friends anymore?
---
I think a Legion is the best bet. Two bonused neuts, Hams and Drones, the thing shits DPS and tank scales really well with bling. I flew the strat religious and took out snakes and T3Cs regularly, legion is better
---
Spoken with all the eloquence and maturity of a drunk toddler.
---
I might now have a wife but i got a waifu.
---
You didn't list San Antonio.  Downvote.
---
iam against botting of all sorts but with today's tools that stuff could be also false fake.
---
so in the end we can just believe both at the same time its true and not true. when its true elo should fucking do his crusade internally first. when its not true its some good fake news propaganda :)
---
you stole MY MEME
---
I’m sure giant bloc will prepare ‘over’ 40 recon lol
---
They need cyno for subs, multiple groups of faxes, also multiple group of dread bombs, titans, supers. (titans/supers/faxes bumps each other a lot so must be even more)
---
Considering they will need 3~5 backup cyno for these, it’s even hard to guess.
---
It looks nonsensical? yes. but MUST prepare like this after patch.
---
Think FCs want to do this nonsensical job? Absolutely not.
---
Think we will get more capital fight? hell no.
---
I don't trust anything thats posted in the internet, without any exceptions.
---
But in this ONE case, as it goes against botters, i agree to whatever you say "raises fork" ... :P
---
thank you community that with all the beef and opinions we have we atleast stay united to say ccp should invest in the game again and that largescale wise :)
---
We don't get many capital fights already, so that's not really a huge concern.
---
I don't doubt our fcs abilities as much as you do.
---
I think they'll be pretty fine.
---
There's a lot of mystery in EvE, that's one of the things that draws me to it.
---
Duh
---
In this case I'm referring to tapi supporting XiX and the OP suggestion that they are worried about botting in FRT, maybe you didn't read the whole thread. That is why I specifically am talking about XiX, lets not start with KWG as this damns tapi even more. I don't think you realize that this is me calling out tapi more than calling out bots.
---
someone correct me if i'm wrong, but i believe chinese players need to use a vpn in order to access tq.
---
You mentioned a video and neglected to link it...
---
Oh neat! I thought all the stations in Jove space had been switched to Gallente models!
---
Significantly dial up the average BAC level and yeah...
---
Ban everything above t1 frigates and I think we'll be good to go
---
This was a copy-past from the FC's writeup on our discord, I was working with him to make sure the video was ok to post, it is up now
---
I would prefer an ingame recorder that I can watch and adjust the camera to anything on grid in that system. The reason you do not hear comms in most eve videos is that they are sped up so the voices are also sped up or not in sync with what is going on. Music is easier to sync as an external sound file since it just really has to match the mood to fit.
---
the AAR and video was shared in the corp discord, my bro wanted to make sure I was ok with the vid before posting :thumbs:
---
I've always liked the implication that being an f1 monkey is just a constant cry for help.
---
This is only a problem because you compulsively stack all.
---
Are you sure? From this reddit I'm picturing everyone ratting in supers and mining in rorqs
---
I think my assumptions check out. Every year about 1 in 1000 men in the age group 15 - 45 die. Seeing there’s like 1,1 million accounts I came to that number.
---
If they could just add the ability to spin the ship in a station I won't ever have to login again.
---
There is many capital fights, just you’re not interested about it.
---
You even don’t need to check kb, just see reddit posts of battle reports.
---
Also I’m p sure FCs can deal against it, but I’m also sure FCs will not WANT to do it. 
---
FCing is already very stressful job itself, even small gang FC is.
---
but muh nergals
---
This dude ain't neutral.
---
&gt; The other was an Alliance Tournament player that got loose (they used to do the fights in Jove space) and roamed around a bit before they realised, there were some pictures on the old forums I think.
---
Do you have a link or a direction to point me in?
---
Eve or being an accountant?

Do you have any screenshot with his QQ ID in it? It's a common practice to make fakes like this in QQ for slander... If it doesn't show QQ ID it's harder to believe.

Damage bonus on fighters and drones, resist damage from fighters and drones
---
Oh my fucking sides, thank you.
---
Yeah, I know about that, but if there was a Jove construct in the Heaven constellation you'd think they would update the model. And apparently they did, since [this station](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/HD3-JK_I_-_Academy_of_Aggressive_Behaviour) is still visible in-game.
---
The station must be hidden *really* well for it to not be found after all this time. Maybe it needs to be scanned down?
---
I am still newish and it is exceeding infuriating when I accidentally activate it and can’t look around normally. But you’re right. If you’re in a cheap ass cloaky ship parked what 200km off grid you can just fly around in the tactical camera, completely impotent, but also mostly safe (I think)
---
yep
---
Right click, split, enter number, stack is split as random in range of [0, number]. Moar chaos.
---
No
---
I don't understand why someone would use a JF for this when a freighter holds more stuff and is way cheaper.
---
Use a freighter, and don't warp repeatedly to a structure in system in null-sec with a JF or freighter or capital unless you have eyes on both grids.  Otherwise this is what happens to you.
---
I like the decloaking idea, maybe give them a larger decloaking radius than other ships? Like 10km or something.
---
I make videos. I'm currently working on an Eve Cinematic and also a fight video.   
---
The two types are completely different to record and piece together in a video. The fight ones are 90% zoomed out for a reason and most people watching them will be able to understand why someones doing something a certain way. Whereas the Cinematic videos can be cool camera angles and awesome ship shots etc.
---
Both types of videos have different audiences, with a small crossover.  
---
I'm not really sure what it is that you're asking, because what you're asking would be abused to hell. The only way to really do it would be a replay feature and that would be really really hard to implement as Eve is happening in real time. The sheer size of the files alone to be able to store all that data...
---
Oh, i stand corrected then, thanks.
---
thats why im upset about this ccp testing player base. Didnt work.
---
people start caring all of a sudden when it aligns with their interest...
---
Good fight! Next time bump it into the bubble so you can catch the pod too.
---
So, would that make [Nidia Masters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cpxkes/horde_gate_behavior/) the EvE equivalent of a veteran NCO?
---
Should we also avoid the use of the word murder?
---
...I genuinely can't tell if you're being facetious or not.
---
Wasn't the expectation that null sec players who didn't want to rat/mine without local were moving to lowsec?  I'd have thought ls would be busting out at the seams by now with so much content.
---
hmm.....
---
Think more and you'll get to KWG merging and mangoes going at it.

good shout! ty for the tip

Completely missing the point, but I suspect that's intentional.

But why would Test hold the botting that happened under XIX renter alliance against them? Unless there is proof that XiX leadership was complicit with said botting, i don't see why Test, or anyone should be crucifying XiX for a crime that ultimately wasn't their fault.
---
It is not the job of players to police eve online.
---
I'm sure if I presented **irrefutable** evidence to the leadership people in the HRE, about someone in their renter alliance botting under their noses, they would take action. Same thing for the Russians,NC, Panfam, and Test as well, but ultimately its not their job to police it, to investigate, and to punish, that's CCP responsibility, all a player should be required to do, is report it, and let CCP do their job.
---
And yes, i do realize that you were telling a Test pilot that they shouldn't be too quick to judge FRT considering who their ally is, and i think there is merit in that argument, despite the [recent](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cxh8at/leaks_show_that_noraus_elos_new_buddy_trumps/) *allegations* against FRT and WinterCo. 
---
I do see your point, i just really don't think people should be throwing rocks at the Russians, considering that it was not the Russians who were protecting and giving refugee to bots, but the renter business itself that Nullsec collectively adopted (until recently) that makes the life for bots extremely easy in nullsec.
---
My problem with bottling is that it’s so obvious yet I feel like CCP does nothing (not enough) to stop it. I’m a wormholer who goes out to mull often, and it’s just so obvious to tell bots from people. Like, I don’t even have to be ingame. For example, this weekend this happened: Just from Dotlan, I saw 10 systems with identical NPC kill deltas which resembled that of a Domi or a Myrm at 8am in the morning in Tenal, otherwise fucking dead and deserted space. Even before I leave the hole, I know it’s a bot and I know there’s 20 of them, 2 in each system. Of course, when I go hunt, I catch 1 or maybe 2, but the rest instantly dock up. In an hour, they’ve made back several times the value of the lost Myrm. It’s just so frustrating.
---
CCP can't make an offer of any kind, or any shitty log in event without someone saying exactly this.
---
Bruh I make braindead decisions in game all the time
---
High grade Crystal's, under 2 bill for the ship when I bought it. Use it in WHs all the time. 
---
Its perfect unless they have like 3 machs alphaing you off the grid lol. Other downside is no web and slow because AB, but its WH space, so brawling is more prominent. 
---
I like it because for 99% of encounters you will not die, especially if they dont have a bhall sitting there. I still need to test this, but unless the bhall is full neuts, you should still be able to rep because it's over +200 cap per second at the bottom end, so youlle still be able to cycle. 
---
Anyway, tengu will get less tank but you have a web, or similar tank but costs 1 bill more lol... tengu puts out slightly more DPS because OH on sixth launcher vs drones on loki. ~900DPS OH
---
Dont know much about legion, dont my much Amarr.
---
Gotta protect that botting income eh?
---
Just asking if he can turn on the simple setting in QQ to actually show the QQ number...
---
or make electronic attack frigs better?
---
maybe a bonus to aux reps or something like access to ACU's?
---
Yes show me posts from the last week concerning capital fights with enough force on grid to instantly vaporize any recon that decloaked within 50km.
---
Go ahead.
---
And low power structures have no timer.
---
&gt;And its showing on the rapid decline of players.
---
It is showing the rapid decline of bots. CCP said other stats are showing players actually playing the game more. WOW Classic being released lowered player numbers more than blackout.
---
&gt;Like you convinced me with your post that it might not work to completely divide the groups.
---
More variety of different playstyles, the better for the game. And the harder it is to just grind isk mindlessly the higher ISK value will become and that will generate new gamestyle options. Suddenly it might be worth taking huge risks to live out in nullsec because you earn huge amounts of isk there if you know how to play. 
---
Stagnation comes from easy isk farming gamestyle. It makes the playerbase fat &amp; whiny. Harder Eve forces you to learn how to play better to survive. And better players make more fun gameplay for everyone. Harder game creates opportunities for FC's to become better and that makes you enjoy fleeting with them more.
---
I LOVE LAMP
---
Nope just came down to your level
---
I honestly don't see the issue with caps in lowsec it's never hindered the content before even for just small gang, this is different. Some people say it's because of WoW Classic. But IDK roamed 4 different regions, span of 2+ hours. Only ship we found undocked (that wasn't tethered to a citadel) was a single breacher. after we got back to staging despite it being way earlier than I'd usually log I just said I'm gonna go watch a movie or something.
---
Thanks, I forgot about that!

Hop in with Spectre Fleet if you just want some easy-access pvp fleets. Daily fleets of a ton of different types. SF Spectre Fleet ingame chat.
---
Settle down, Chicken Little... the sky isn't falling.   Or, no more so than it has been since... forever.   
---
A shiny new thing came out and as you'd expect, for the first few months people are gonna flock to it.    Especially something like WoW Classic, which (as I've never played WoW so I am only guessing) mean to capitalize on veteran player's nostalgia for a time when MMOs we're fresh and new, and microtransactions weren't cancer.  
---
Give it a few months.
---
Yay .. take advantage of supercap umbrella :)
---
I guess i can only kill goons on my alt now..
---
Which they use for their industrials, too. Sansha really does need more models, and the Revenant needs more spikes.
---
Would bringing down the price of Marauders fix this? Those things can tank for days and do 1000+ dps without any effort. They really perform the way I think a Battleships should perform but they're so pricey no one really PVPs with em.
---
I think we just need pirate/navy destroyers and battlecruisers but please dont just pick the same model and paint it like the serpentis
---
Adding it all was a bonehead move. Fleet inties should lose it as well.
---
Yeah it's not the greatest, I'll agree, but there *is* at least one ongoing war in the south, plus there's just been a huge invasion in the north, and now the Tribute-Pure Blind zone is a Mad-Max style wasteland of small groups doing totes adorbs small group things. Not to mention the ongoing soap-opera shennanigans in Providence. And Blackout. And the cyno changes.
---
So yeah there's no *current* "Great War" right now, but there's at least a fair amount of action going on. "Great Wars" are infrequent and always have been, but people seem to think that they should be the norm, even though they're vastly destructive all-out efforts.
---
NB: Just before you joined, the whole of sov 0.0 was literally the CFC on one side, and NCPL on the other, with Provibloc as a kind of game reserve/training ground. It was genuinely 10x worse than this. Google "Marlona Sky coalition map" to see what I mean.

Hey spods. Daily reminder that your corp literally exists as a spin off to the most garbage shit upvote site ever. I bet you think you're witty like that dweeb from the big black cock theory.
---
Just put in a ticket. They’re usually pretty good about it if it’s within their power.
---
And if you’re polite.
---
there aren't really any sorry  
---
eve isn't about what you think it's about

MWD bonuses would be good. Combat scanning would need some tweaking - they'd have to find a way to limit it to just ships being scannable with them. Alternatively maybe make them have half the D-Scan immunity bonus, detectable only at 7.15 AU instead of 14.30 to make them better as fast hunting tackle.
---
Outside that as solo ships they're actually quite strong. Taranis can very easily solo procurers on their own and many missile boats for example.

Classic Elo.

Huh I think I sold him that ark. What a waste

I have an i5-6600k, 16gb ram, and an rtx 2070, m.2 ssd.
---
Runs 8 toons perfectly.
---
Also just tested unplugging the power from my RTX: Intel graphics is great and I can still run all 8 in potato mode, no performance impact.
---
Wasn't their fault? Mate all the null block enabled botters to bot so easily. I will admit that alliances shouldn't be policing, that's CCPs job. XiX, LEGACY, etc etc for years HAVE KNOWN botting happens in their previous rental empires. For years they ignored it and accepted all dirty bot isk.  Even when they were high lighted in r/eve in the past, they still were not removed from their rental alliances. 
---
B0t, the Imperium and other rental groups have been making it very blatant that bots are not welcomed. While this is probably CCPs work, at least they acknowledge that bots exist and with adequate proof, will more than like be removed. This is something that they should have done years ago. 
---
I am calling out XiX not The Russians, all Russians are not in XiX. Nor am I defending FRT, not once did I ever say they were innocent. I admit there is bias and I do have a bone to pick with XiX but the reality is that XiX, even when given evidence, did not remove botters. Sure, they did not openly support it, but they sure as hell welcomed it.  Obviously it's changed now, but I don't forget so easily. Legacy complaining about botting while support/supported XiX, mangos, former KWG and other groups that openly botted is pretty funny.
---
You need to use Wine, then it works a dream.
---
&gt; one quite irrational thing which always bothered me in EVE, "the further the target the better hits are", up to extent of my tach oracle decimating frigs which are 200k away.
---
Are you talking in optimal, or falloff. Because it sounds like an issue with how falloff scales, which is still a problem for ACs after the TE nerf.
---
It's a sad fact most of the big blocs have some level of botting/rmt going on. Hell i have an alliance mate who got sent screenshots of a highend fc who was openly rmting.
---
Clearly its "Ha I'm gay pwned"

This game's language is harder than Russian to me now a-days.

I would call Goons anything - krabs, cancerous blib, but the last thing they are is botters.

Tip for next time with the Rapid Heavys: (This is a trick that comes up more with Rapid Lights, but it also can be used here) If you have a good load of Nanite Repair Paste available, you can Overheat your Rapid Launchers for about 2/3s of a cycle, then when they hit reload, start Repairing them. Because you can repair heat damaged modules while they're reloading, you get to burn the launchers, fully repair them them, and then the moment they finish reloading start overheating them again.
---
Autz but yesterday was off work and flew in all 3 tz. And metropolis heimatar bleak lands and whatever the other amarr fw area is it's been void of content.
---
You make a good point about accessibility/predictably of the site spawns.   I was mostly thinking of it from a FW/low-sec perspective.
---
If you can’t handle an opinion that doesn’t agree with your own
---
Then you shouldn’t speak, that is my opinion.
---
You can actually fly anything.
---
They web first.
---
So you flying a freighter through their space would be faster than any other space.
---
This is a terrible fucking idea.
---
Also not clear what ammo you are using on the modo
---
No, republic fleet and blood raider tags
---
Half the world is still at work.... It's not even close to prime time
---
lowseccers are too busy trying to do lowsec shit in nullsec then complaining about mechanics being different
---
So arguably the most popular MMO in history releases a classic mode and you expect EVEs number not to fall for a bit? Thas crazy even for you stainguy
---
Lol. I still take whs to null in bombers but yeah barren wasteland.
---
You must be really great at hunting if you have to target gunless whales.
---
As opposed to what lmao, EvE-O forums which had the worst track record in gaming history to only cater to one demographic of player? That said if something happens to a new player, and they read the sub and see people also complaining about it, is the real problem the actual problem or the people complaining? lmao
---
Eve is always going to be toxic, the game used to cater to people who would HTFU, now what is it?
---
I read long ago a lore article about the number of crewmembers in EvE ships, but I can't find it anymore. Does anyone knows what I'm talking about ?
---
so you're saying you wouldn't have tried to kill him if it was you? how very noble of you
---
Sadly I can’t do anything for that TZ or area. Black rise and placid are good in EU TZ.
---
You have to be in something reasonable though. 
---
We had a nice hour long fight on the vlil/ocix gate 2 nights ago. We lost a lot in isk value but the fight it’s self was very good. Win some lose some as long as you having fun.
---
In English?(kidding). Thanks for the link, I guess I wasn't sure what to actually put into google. There's been a few times I've tried looking for something for Eve and I've had to wade through irrelevant links.
---
yeah I remembered that after the first reload and tried to repair on the second but didn't have enough paste \*facepalm\*
---
Guys relax it's just the bots shutting down and everyone else is playing a little wow classic for an undisclosed amount of time
---
NOTHING TO SEE HERE!
---
Also no more log in rewards to inflate login numbers right after starting blackout... subscriptions are actually sky rocketing and player activity is off the charts you just arent looking at ALL the data. The special secret opsec stuff.
---
Agreed I never care about losses lmao rote kapelle dropped 20 dudes on our 3 man destroyer gang last week. I was like hey at least it's something... And we got one lol.
---
I bet that one was more pissed than you 3 !
---
Because the big null blocs think they can operate with impunity, and they have the ISK to throw around because of the last few years of easy AFK ratting/mining. That's why they're throwing such a tantrum now with blackout and cyno changes. There's real risk involved.
---
I’ve never played EVE, but I earned my MSAE way back in ‘93, and I wanted to congratulate you on the start of your adventure. You will be tested in many ways over the next couple of years. Parts of it will suck. But the things you will learn and the connections you make will absolutely be worth it. Best of luck to you!
---
Webless with HAMs? Seems like a recipie to lose a TON of damage.
---
I think they're all playing in highsec, but it's looking pretty bleak there too.  Not really sure what part of the game they are playing in actually, they must haveoved somewhere!
---
you got isk and we got content, not such a waste... unless you are talking from his point of view, then yeh.
---
Don't, it was very specifically setup for its usage, and will not really do well at anything else
---
its not ccp's fault! they can't be the failure of their own business model! i mean cmon they bring out soon new shiny mobile games with eve lore since they gave up to invest in eve since 2010.
---
Could of done the job with an 800 mil freighter. Always hate seeing jfs used as normal freighters.
---
Last time i did HS ganking, it was so incredibly crowded with ninja looting bots that it was hardly worth the effort. Do you know whether it's still like that?
---
I've got some bath water to sell you in Jita, baby.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?
---
I was just pointing out that when it comes to FRT issues, Tglam is about as neutral as I am about Test issues. I.E., not at all.
---
cool, they aren't bots either, but nice irrelevancy I guess
---
Yeah the area of Paragon soul I'm in definitely is dead since blackout started. Good luck finding targets.
---
|with no local you don't know what awaits you. 
---
You dont have local with those specific ships or did they remove local from nullsec?
---
local is gone from null.
---
I am talking about tracking part, ignoring range. The further the target - the less angular velocity - the easier it is to hit. It's one of reasons titan guns are so effective against battleships at range, for example.
---
&gt; subscriptions are actually sky rocketing
---
You seem nervous.
---
Oooooooh, neat. Might be worth playing eve again then. Any other gamechanging changes?
---
The Russians part was my slip up, i meant XiX.
---
We have a profound disagreement to what constitute a individual fault.
---
I don't think it was the fault of the nullsec blocks for adopting the Rental Empire model, since they did it because the game as it was designed before the changes recently, made Rental Empires the objectively better way of using your space.
---
And as i stated, if you look at the data presented by Peligro, you will see that the renter alliances dominated CCP list of bans for the past few years, and judging by the numbers, its impossible to claim that one alliance was complicity without calling all of them complicity (you seem to be implying that in your comment, but I very much disagree with that generalization).
---
Just because they adopted a model that benefited the botters, doesn't mean that they are complicity, it also benefited a lot of individual players who did played in a fair way under the Rental system.
---
My point is that just because a service was also used for illegitimate purposes, it does not make the service itself illegitimate, it just means that there is poor oversight, which was the real problem, all of this renter alliances had poor oversight, since they were only managed by few individuals, it was impossible for those individuals to investigate the botting that happened under their noses, but even if it was possible, and i'm glad we at least have something to agree here, it wasn't their responsibility to investigate anyway, so why should it be their fault?
---
Every single rental alliance received some amount of "dirty isk"a s you call it, all of them did, again, if we agree that it is not the job of alliances to investigate claims of botting, and punish those found botting, why is it their fault that it happened at all?
---
well in a few days. only recon ships and Black op battleships will be able to light cyno's.
---
This is true.
---
it's scourge rage
---
The Normal cyno's the covert ones can be lit by all existing ones

ahh yeah, my mistake. well then i was wrong i guess

do not trust ANYTHING from ccp unless its written in devblogs.

ccp likes to make promises, especially on fanfests that never ever make it into the game.
---
The shadowy cabal of Frat's upper echelons have a penchant for scoffing and deflecting all criticism. Not based in the reality of their place within nullsec or Insmother but out of mere homegrown hubris. Eloknight is a particular problem character, who has a hot temper and is constantly cussing and shouting at line members who take the time out of their day to join his fleets.
---
I think [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cx2zfu/outer_rim_hell_divers_a_small_perspective_on_a/) by some one the other day shows the type of fun I see a lot of people having, my play is more HW centric as I fly from a industry base in jspace, but that’s my deal and I’m having hun with the two or so hours I get to play.

At the end of the day, those alliances chose to make rental empires on their own accord. No one forced them to do so, while CCP did make it the 'optimal' way to have space, this does not mean that one has to do it. They wanted isk and KNEW that their format could/would invite botting to happen so easily. Then on top of that, VERY LITTLE oversight of the corporations that joined just made it worse. They wanted easy isk, and little management at the cost of the game. 
---
I will admit this is MOSTLY CCP's fault, at the end of the day they made their choice. In my view, they knew what they were doing. Luckily CCP has made it more strict for everyone that harbours bots. None of the null empires are innocent, this is why I call it dirty isk.

No I'm just stating the facts. More new subs than ever, to  hell with whatever that counter says about players online. Clearly it doesn't look at any metrics that actually mean anything important.
---
Ouch. Rewatching the video I see that now on the second reload.  138 pasta for 60% heat damage? ... yeah this sort of thing is why I carry a few hundred on most of my medium and larger ships, they start to eat it up a bit.
---
Thanks for your reply, but the chirp is clearly related to the results. To clarify, I'm not talking about the "bong" sound that the scanner makes when the results are returned. There is another sound that is played when newly-scanned objects are returned (the "chirp" I'm referring to). It seems to play when objects are returned that weren't present on the last scan, but I can't figure out why some objects produce the chirp and others don't.
---
There's someone in low sec??? Shit, what system?
---
do you have a link?
---
i didn't hear about that
---
&gt; Katia Sae, the first player to visit every system in New Eden, was rewarded by CCP and taken to Polaris.
---
I read about that, she's a lucky lady!
---
&gt; Alliance Tournament pilots have been able to visit three or four systems through the years. The pilot that got loose and looked around was none other than Gobbins, the now-leader of Pandemic Horde and CSM member. Since then they have removed gates.
---
Yeah, doesn't the Alliance Tournament take place in those systems at the "top" of the map that still have gate connections between them?
---
Sometimes I give out too much information and then regret it so I delete the comment. I'm torn because I want to help people and show them how easy it is to make good isk in lowsec, but then I remember most of it is based on LP... so i don't want to attract too many people and hurt my own income.
---
So I think the best thing to do is leave hints but no indication of how OP PVE is in Lowsec. It's probably best if folks just keep on thinking it's impossible to make isk out here so I can keep it flowing into my own wallet.
---
...and here I am breaking my own rule.
---
For clarification, I'm not talking about the "bong" noise the D-scanner makes when returning scan results. There is a distinctly different "chirp"-like tone that is played when new objects are scanned (new meaning objects that weren't present in the previous scan).
---
does a solid shit lose its smell?
---
WoW was the 1st MMO
---
Oh. Well, thanks for the heads-up then.

---
Never mind the Computer Science skills you pick up.  I learned to work with tables in MATLAB because of Eve, then used those new skills to optimize codes used in research and the classroom.  I never would have learned any of those skills 'just because', but Eve gave me a 'why' to learn more programming.
---
I haven't done it in the past half year, but it depends on the location. The top places could be still camped (Niarja, Uedama), but side areas should be somewhat clear.
---
If everything fails, just use a Tornado in the 0.8+ systems between Jita and Kaaputeenen.
---
TAPI themselves do not have many botters. Their AOM pets... We all know what they do all day long in Omist.
---
The fact you remembered to overheat means you are already smarter than have the managers I have had in my career.
---
No such thing. Just regular level 5s done in a carrier. Takes a massive effort to set up. 3 carriers put in place, 7.0 standing on two characters. Dramiels for both characters. All in all cost me 10-12 bill for my first setup.
---
Plz explain

Please WOW take all the whiners and shitlers with you. Thanks
---
There are navy battlecruisers, but yeah, I'd like to see more pirate hulls made playable. Especially the Angel hulls that have been in-game since the beginning, like the Ixion, Lynx, Swordspine, and Medusa.
---
The Skilling Spree ended at the same time, so it could also be that but yes the numbers have dropped a lot.
---
One month until Glamourex boosters expire, at which point people will be forced to run regular missions again.

Wiat so broadcasts bypass recognition, clicking, lock time, and cycle time?
---
And broadcasts also happen immediately?
---
And I have been in large fleets on major conflicts.
---
So provide a video of this happening to you.
---
Do you have the system map open?
---
There is definitely no chirp with it closed.
---
hic pilot btw
---
seddow put a shit ton of pressure on me lul
---
There are ships models for the Talocans, frig, cruiser, BS I think and they are considered as wrecks in the game files but never saw one, maybe in some wh site
---
Yeah they chose to do it, because nullsec is a competitive environment where having more isk means having more power to protect your stuff, and once your enemies start doing a rental empire and making over a trillion isk a month doing it, you kinda have do it if you don't want to fall behind.
---
This was the dilemma that the CFC faced at the end of the Fountain War, a coalition that always looked down upon renters, couldn't ignore the information they got from the disbanding of S2N Citizens, their enemies were making over a trillion isk a month with their rental empire, so in order to not fall behind, they also started a rental empire.
---
I'd like to give you some real life context from a historian about the Napoleon Invasion of Russia to aid my point.
---
"...Discipline in the army was lax, with the result that troops plundered indiscriminately instead of carrying out orderly requisitions, the outcome being, paradoxically, that **the officers - at any rate, those who refuse to take part in such excesses - starved, even when the men found enough to eat."** (Van Crevald, Martin: Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton, p. 65-66).
---
Point is, having your conscious clear that nothing that you did negatively impacted the game, might feel nice, but does it really matter if your alliance gets evicted by those that weren't bound by said morals?
---
&gt;facts
---
You got some proofs then? 
---
Look, I understand you're nervous, but nothing will change until you accept things aren't working out.
---
You know, i never bothered reading about them and just ran guristas burners. I probably fucked up by not paying attention.
---
We saw an opportunity to use the cache we were building in PZMA so we took it. Half of the tempests got booshed off early on, but they did their job. Thing was close to cap dead (or at least turned off it's smartbombs) after about 30 seconds and we were able to hold point with the heavy scrams until a hic arrived to lock the dude down for good.
---
It takes a really long time to copy paste implants, adjust values, then copy paste drop table info. 
---
Like, a really long time. It's like a siege battle against POS code.
---
Its 2019, digital evidence hardly even qualifies as evidence anymore.  All you need is something to power the narrative, regardless if its true.
---
You have to look at the downside, because that’s what will be exploited to hell, your idea would literally break the game.
---
If you want film a battle, you will have to commit a cloaked alt, the train for a Astero with cob-op is just a few days, and totally worth it if you want to be a dedicated battle videographer.
---
I like a lot of the ideas posted in the thread. I think it would be great if they could have extended d-scan range. It fits with the idea that they are like scout ships but doesn't change the balance in actual combat. That and a scram range bonus would bring them back to life even though in direct combat they're still somewhat weak.
---
Even they will tell you that
---
Just don’t fly into anything, I’d be further away.
---
SO elite. SO epic. You are SO brave.
---
Whoa, you mean two of the oldest and most established MMOs have overlapping player bases? Shit...
---
Ultimately I'm not too worried. We'll take a hit at first but the numbers will go back up. For better or worse, Eve is a game you can play while also playing other games, and people will.
---
Source keeps this 2018.5 screenshot when sard was in Branch but choose to reveal now. I doubt how clean is that source itself.
---
I'm no moralist, but I have my bottom line. I understand what you are saying, and all this, again, is mostly CCPs fault. What would I have done? I would have stopped and let my coalition collapse. This is not real life. This is a game, where I can be competitive, but again, its just a game. I'm not going to try hard in eve online just to show everyone I have a bigger e-peen. There are better places where you can project that energy. 
---
Everyone is not the same, so I get it, I'm not going to force anyone to think like me. What I will do is give shit to tapi or whomever I feel like giving shit.
---
fair enough
---
Bring back the pleasure hub interiors!
---
Fine, take my upvote
---
I honestly have no idea how far away you can be and still use tactical camera
---
1) The thing that citadels replaces are no longer common gameplay, go figure.
---
2) Theft is still possible, you are talking about pos stuff, not WH space, and are conflating the issue.  
---
3) Contraband was fucking irrelevant.  Faction navy wouldn't barley even catch autopilot shit iirc.  
---
4) Yes station games have died.  You say this is bad, I say station games were symptom of bad design.  Station games need to become gate/warp based combat instead of docking based combat.  
---
5) CCP developed nullsec into something worth having pve chars live in, so all the neutral l4 mission alts moved to better areas.  This was a good change for the game, regardless of the whining on reddit.  If your 'gameplay' was baiting noobs, you are just like the vni hunters whining about people 'warping off'.
---
QQ ID won't help with verification.

I choose to believe it because it was an ex/afk-member of SARD who posted these screenshots to argue with another SARD guy. They sounded like they both knew what happened in that corp, and the first guy deleted the post so quickly after the argument was over.

You actually can use your power to find out them in-game, but I doubt that you can get anything from them. Because you may know some Chinese jokes, but you seem to have no idea about Chinese politics at all.
---
But that's just reasonable, no? That was my point, that it's sensible to have such real-world mechanics so long as you're within optimal, it's just how that goes into falloff that could be the crux of the issue.

Ok let's make it simple, since your "EVE is dying" prediction is possibly one of the most dramatic yet we won't need to wait very long to find out who is right here...

Salt levels on this post are at an all time high.
---
You can literally automate this with fittings.
---
Probably both
---
Much to the disappointment of hilmar falcon and rise.
---
Very, although it gets kinda jittery after about 2000km.
---
I'm pushing for changes that will make even battleship ratting untenable. If I get my way all you poor's will be forced to buy plex to trade for isk, or go away once and for all. NO POORS, LEARN HOW TO GET MORE MONEY
---
That slope is the same it has been for every week.  It will pop back up a bit on Sat / Sun.  
---
WoW hasn't taken away players, the slow decline over the past few months is just CCP attempt to slowly drive away their players.
---
These need to be added to everything. characters, ships, planets, roids, cans, citadels, gates, wh's visible modules, stars etc...
---
I don't think so, but I could be wrong.
---
Way to keep the DD on the vanq and turn it off on the komodo. Here it is with the DD on, just like it is on the vanq: https://i.imgur.com/ufYl06B.png
---
30349 DPS.
---
if you are undocked, yea you are ratting in supers and mining in rorqs.  but most people are just not logging or just logging in and stayed docked because for some fing reason eve doesn't kick you out if you are afk for 23 hours.
---
The amount of people that don't understand economies of scale definitely shows you that not everyone EVE would survive the business world.
---
Do your Steam settings look like this: [https://imgur.com/jJlEZYQ](https://imgur.com/jJlEZYQ)
---
Wouldn't have happened if there was local.
---
LOL! 75% in Hi-Sec. Goes against everything CCP and the blue donut of gayness claim.
---
They are not joining KF just to get their stuff back. Also, they are in NPC space, literally they can just fly it out.
---
Had to wait 20 mins for DotA 12v12 euro servers today morning, everyone playing WoW classic
---
Just to put things in context, one side is 80%, other side is 20%.
---
For real, just be first and they will pay out. Always post in local once you have received isk and never be last :p
---
hi friend (◕‿◕✿)
---
Who's fault is that?
---
I also like how he just ejected after he got under 50% hull..
---
Use tactical camera. It detaches from your ship and you can move it wherever on grid.
---
I think he may have had a combo training clone and reprocessing implant in, didn't want to lose those.
---
dunno but slaves have recently gotten renamed to amulets
---
&gt;They went to init,
---
uh?
---
I was thinking that too, but congrats on the kill.
---
You could feasibly just build it there, but it'd be fairly stuck unless you plan on keeping it in your little well controlled pocket.
---
That is useful af! Thanks!
---
If you mine while doing other things (pretty easy) then the ooprtunity cost *is* pretty low. Obviously it's not free, but i can easily see having a "don't care" attitude.
---
-99.99% PG requirement for 500MN modules.
---
-99% capacitor usage on MWDs.
---
No. All the good bumpers have somebody around to agress the target.
---
Will do - either on Twitch or Discord.
---
All that would do is further reduce the number of players online and encourage others not to log in
---
Someone who is rich give he/she gold
---
You’re a fucking spaz calm down and BE neutral you raging fuck
---
Right or wrong doesn’t matter you want to be mad and witch hunt you do you.  I think they’re botting scum but an out of place screenshot of a language i can’t read from people i can’t prove who they are is akin to me running to ccp with pictures of “tecnic1” from reddit with a text claiming you say you hack the servers daily.
---
It’s heresay at best.  Be mad about it.
---
Jita local says Redbull gives you wins
---
Caldari/gallente FW space has been pretty active. Come through
---
I find #4 very curious, in that there's three obvious population bands in JSpace (C5/C2, C3/C4, C1/C6) that were almost perfectly even in population until Rhea and Proteus
---
And now I'm wondering how much further they've diverged in the subsequent four years

You must not be a man of culture.
---
The safest way to make isk is still farm wormholes.
---
Otherwise if you have enough liquid isk to make a juicy profit off speculating, it makes me a ton of isk especially when both recon ship classes skyrocketed.
---
You can also bust out the credit card and buy some plex. Instant isk!
---
Amarr local says Git Gud

Buy some MCT's please, babe &lt;3

It's already at 22K at the time of this post. Which seems to be in margin compared to a week span.
---
We actually considered Houston for a while but decided on San Diego this time around.
---
Could be on the cards for 2021 though for sure, I'm also a fan of hosting something in Austin for sure, but we'll have to see what happens.
---
No decisions made yet and no promises.
---
Check your overview settings have all Npcs enabled. I'm betting you have certain ones disabled
---
Never said it was purely solo. The thing is you can live when taking a WH until your buds get there with proper webs/ e war. I'd much rather run into a small gang of 5 people in that loki, start a fight and get content going than have to bail or even die before something starts up. 
---
Also, with T3C, if they are a group you've fought before they might not drop a bhall on you right away. I've seen more neut legion/curse than bhaal. Most T3C will be neuted out from a curse
---
If I play "solo" it's a dual web and neut strat paired with the loki, fixes application, adds neut pressure, and several hundred DPS.
---
if they allow abyssal implants i can tell my friends "you can enchant amulets in EVE now"
---
Not true. Ive seen way more cloaky hunter loki's and legion's compared to tengus.
---
You had time to yell all that out while he was driving like an idiot? I bet he didnt hear a thing.
---
no way, my OW are a perfect, also this thing no have nothing wrong with OW, it's visual, when they attack me just i see a web and cap drain
---
😂
---
Thank you for the good content.
---
The offer is unusual with 15% instead of 30%.
---
"Position harvester so that the panels face the star at the optimal angle to collect light"
---
*Yes but which star?*
---
Honestly citadels are better for the game health. Not losing everything in it because of being gone for a day or two is good. 
---
I think citadel mechanics could use some work, but going full no asset safety isn't the answer imo.
---
Did you turn off brackets? Its hard to help. Put a screen shot. I still think its overview related
---
Yes.
---
In gang it could make a degree of sense then. I am overly partial to web arty, but brawl tank Lokis certainly have their place.
---
I'm sure a lot of krab alts will be shelved. Actual people? Nothing of value will be lost.
---
Spoken like a battered wife.
---
Regrettably im died and self destruct my capsule, you want to say i can remove things from screen? like ships?

---
I can't recall exactly where I saw this (I *think* it was an update on the forum thread), but last I recall hearing was a September release.
---
Yes, I do. As far as I can tell, the chirp only plays when the system map is open.
---
Cloaked ships can't hurt you, remember?
---
I am not talking about optimal and falloff. Optimal, according to my understanding, range of projectile/beam having full power and falloff is range where it slowly loses power/dissipates.
---
I am talking about accuracy. In real world shooting non-guided projectiles works more like in scheme I propose: if you aim at something and make, say, angular error of 0-10 degrees, you will always hit 1m-sized target at range of 5m (your shots will always be within 87 cm of bullseye), but will often miss if your target is 50m away (up to 868 cm from bullseye).
---
pearl finish to destroy eve online with remove local... and other shit g2 ccp eve is end of life you win econimic bilan society, go down server is lowest expensinse for stupidity
---
because im not see nothing in the site im decloack, but in the instant im do that appear lot ratts invisible to attack me, just i can see effects from web and the drain cap's
---
True. Vault killed ganking more than anything else.
---
Well did they kill you? Post your killmail.
---
There's no way to prove this is real anyways. Screenshots mean nothing in this day and age.
---
holy shit I hadn't spotted this at all! that's why he suddenly exploded with so much hull left, I had to rewatch it again to see that happen
---
C5 WH's. If you need help PM and I can probably help you out finding a hole and getting set up.
---
^ this.  
---
People would rather do one of the most dangerous maneuver they can do with a JF, warping around in NS from station to station without a scout, than just use the correct ship for the task or use a modicum of caution.  
---
It works...till it...well..this. 
---
Nice kill! Sounds like a lot of fun.
---
Go home, rev, you're drunk
---
Lol. K.
---
Let's be totally clear here.
---
The executor of FRT has already been banned for RMT.
---
FRT has already, in their short ass existence, managed to work their way onto the list of alliances with the most banned botting accounts.
---
It's not a stretch to suggest that they don't really have a lot of respect for the EULA.  So when people accuse them of botting, it doesn't really take a leap of faith to find those accusations credible.
---
Also, I'm not mad. Like I said, I was just pointing out the Tglam had an agenda, and is trying to spin it here.
---
Easier to grow new knees than farm a titan confirmed.
---
Lemons are sour you fucking walnut
---
There is no fallacy. The change made it more difficult for bots, therefore, botting in the same way as before has most likely lessened to some degree. This is completely logical.
---
people have reported that bots are now using picket capsules at gates to warn the ratting bots. this is an indication that they have to take extra steps, aka: it's more difficult than before, to bot.
---
&gt;bothers now do HS missions instead
---
okay, that's a good thing because those are far less lucrative than NS ratting, meaning they make less money.
---
mate, your argument is a mess.
---
Read the post I linked, no one will ever build it. Not only that, you can either get one of them, or 400+ normal keepstars.
---
I know right, this is clearly a Rifter fleet.
---
Sorry, I was told time and again cloaked ships can't hurt anyone.
---
I feel like this is absolutely not the sentiment of actual WoW classic players as myself and literally everyone I've talked to has the exact opposite feeling. The feeling is that the nostalgia is amazing but more importantly the sense of community and accomplishment is finally back and that's what everyone missed. It seems the more people play the more they realize just how bad retail wow has gotten. Your comment seems like an initial knee jerk reaction by someone who has no idea what RPGs are and need to be babysat in RPGs.
---
You wouldn’t say that in AUTZ
---
This makes me feel less respect for people with MBA's more so than more respect for Eve Players.
---
what u mean homie?
---
No one is forcing you to do serious PI
---
Agreed
---
Yeah it teaches you patience to deal with morons, like those we encounter IRL
---
why. lowsec is trash. if isk/hr was a concern you'd switch to incursions and missions.
---
#What a bunch of bullshit. 
---
How is anyone supposed to do any industry in null now? Now I need to ask one of my corp mates to scout every citadel I am warping to. If we had local I wouldn't have even undocked my jump freighter to begin with and waited until the reds were out of the constellation or two. That's another player probably leaving the game! Good job CCP! Way to kill the game. It's not like I could move out of null now to do any of this stuff either, I already have myself rooted in null-sec. I think that it's so unfair that I can't log in anymore and enjoy a good movie on Netflix while I print my ISK.
---
Back me up guys, upvote my comment so we can show idiot CCP how they are killing our game!

Prime time is EU though, not 'murican
---
I huff fullerite in a Miasmos ... What job does that qualify me for, window taste-testing?
---
Adding to this that you can also use Lutris though, im having some weird graphics issues i think that the "download entire eve cache" option is broken or something.
---
Absolutely. If you turn off brackets you pretty well won't see shit.
---
So you essentially want small ships to be immune to big ships across the board then? Current gun mechanics already work great, and even at sniping ranges you can get speed tanked by small targets if they fly correctly.
---
que¿
---
Let people enjoy wow classic, most will lose the nostalgia and stop playing, some of those will put more time back into eve
---
Like I said, If we had local I would be station spinning until you fucked off for a country mile or two until it was safe.
---
the counter point is that Zkill is a reason that many people undock and hunt and do other PvP activities. Shiny or against the odds killmails bring probably 50% of players to log in in my estimation.
---
The content that r/Eve needs, not the content r/Eve deserves.

meh....why should I?
---
Make sure you get the butter!
---
Making them better against larger things but weaker to stronger things IMHO. 
---
Bullets and Missiles wider and longer than my hull should not have over 50% application.
---
Ok so you can't show me?
---
I think the Kostenadza set comes among them I think
---
I'm testing it as I type this by swapping overview tabs, and I don't hear the chirp you're talking about. I also tried launching my own probes and still couldn't hear it. I don't suppose you have an audio clip you could share?
---
Losing a ship is fine just make sure your clone was up to date?
---
Flavacol and coconut oil is all I need my friend
---
The blurb says it was based on the Ixion hull. Interestingly enough, the Angel Cartel ships were actually added to the game from the very beginning, even before some of the standard cruisers!
---
I like EVE lore. This is cool
---
Not an uncommon opinion. 
---
The trend line for players has been going down for a long while.  It took a big dip with local changes, then stared to trend down again when CCP started in with talking about the upcoming Cyno changes. WoW classic is just the latest dive.  
---
The engagement with the game and general moral of your typical NS player is really not high at all.  At least that’s the vibe I get in talking with people and looking around.  
---
If people were thrilled with the way Eve was going you would not see both the crappy trend to even lower numbers before WoW classic.  
---
Listening to a lot of Classic players, many of them old time Eve people, they are actually looking for a ‘fun’ game to play, which of late is not Eve.  
---
Will see how long people want to play Classic, but other than the wait times, it’s actually a pretty will thought out experience with plans for ongoing content to be phased it.  
---
I am actually pretty optimistic that a good core of people will want to ride this game to at least ‘the end’ content.  Time will tell I expect.  Look back in 3-4 months and those people will probably stick around for a while.  
---
I expect that this ‘harder’ WoW and classic raid content will appeal disproportionately with Eve players....and even more so since CCP seems hell bent to change the Eve universe in controversial ways.
---
I'm aware of that, I just say it'd be a serious qol improvement
---
Honestly I don't recommended it, at least not if this is your introduction to PvP, most of the time you'll just melt and have no idea why. Fly with others first to get a handle on it, it's alot easier to pick up with some c̶a̶n̶n̶o̶n̶ ̶f̶o̶d̶d̶e̶r fleet mates around you.
---
I didn't say anything about asset safety, and at no stage will you lose all your stuff because you went away for a day or two, that's not how citadel timers work.
---
Testing 1 , 2
---
Came from a Hentai Game named Sengoku Rance.
---
To each their own :)
---
I love arty loki as well, maybe should roll around with one
---
&gt;Before this change people could logout and disappear in 5 minutes.
---
Not really, assuming the bumper actually bothered to lock the target they couldn't safe log.
---
past two days were much better for my health. atm i am only occasionally logging into eve and working on a pve setup like a filthy krab, but once i feel better i might fly officer fits again, who knows (◕‿◕✿)
---
that being said, i quit most of my eve discords just to stay sane.. and i try not to read /r/eve too much. no offense :P
---
Or just have no alts or one and not take 20 minutes of holding a target down to actually make your attack. If you bump someone, follow through with your attack or don't waste their time in the first place.
---
yup, that is pretty much what is going on.
---
Except that doesn't work if you're targeted or poked with a corvette. :P
---
What titan
---
That too.
---
Definitely a lot of poor quality business decisions.
---
(Also if that was a dig at me, I know that multiboxing rorquals is a profitably scalable activity. My point was directed more so at the bulk of miners that aren't in rorquals and that only have a handful of accounts.
---
So then they can also tackle the target.
---
So, like I said, no real change.
---
I could tell you why that's wrong, but it's a secret.
---
Why do some people leave their passive mods visible, vs hiding them ?
---
Is there some sort of benefit to doing that?
---
&gt; require you to have your own suicide gank accounts on standby.
---
I'm just going to point out that is not an actual solution in any way... ganking a mach would take 7+ alts each flying ships (brutix) that add up to more than the value of the mach you're ganking. The solution would literally be to burn more money than the bumper ever risked just to not be indefinitely tackled.
---
I guess I've to contact them now
---
Nobody is stopping you chatting in local.
---
Sadly I couldn't :(
---
Haha but i think friendship goes way before permaband
---
Maybe why I didn't notice.
---
Could just indicate that the holograms are showing...interesting find.
---
It doesn't have the cardboard skin from permaband sadly but I guess we all know what happens if it had
---
Mining is pretty low return, especially when you're in danger. If you want to care about the economy side of it, look at the yield of your ships in m^(3)/hr, and compare how much you sell your ore for in isk/m^(3). That'll give you your *maximum* isk/hr. Compare that to the cost of losing the ships every 2 hours, or every hour. See where it becomes less than mining in high sec for example. 
---
Then factor in that even not losing your ships, if you have to run from the belt, that's lost mining time that doesn't happen in safer space.
---
Historically, and iirc even now, small scale mining is not high or even mid income for ordinary belt ore.
---
I didn't say safe log.
---
I said log.
---
Of you have no timers, even if ewarp can't complete, you'll despawn in 5 minutes.
---
Locking doesn't change that. You'd have to agress.
---
As /u/rolfski said, it was ganking the big ship, can't interrupt that
---
Indeed it is, hard to handle friendship
---
He definitely was feeding the big guy
---
Being locked doesn't prevent despawning.
---
And if you mean agressed, sure, they can also agress with a disruptor.
---
So no real change. Just a slightly smaller window.
---
Eve is a game of shitposting and fragging unsuspecting carebears
---
This. Report these people to CCP and let them figure it out.
---
Since when?
---
Nah what you on about no one ever shit posts
---
Good ole Gobberino
---
I'll want to find you at EVE Vegas :p
---
Not any secrets left
---
I replied in the other thread, do your Steam settings look like this: [https://imgur.com/jJlEZYQ](https://imgur.com/jJlEZYQ) ?
---
Imagine cloaking actually worked this way. It removes you from Overview, D-Scan and also your bracket from space. But your ship model still stays in space and you can only be locked by clicking on the ship itself. Can't easily cloak with a bigger ship now. Maybe skins that could allow turning of flashing lights when the module is activated. If you stand still, your engines are off so no light to give your location away, but when you are moving, engine trailer can easily give out your location. Hiding inside asteroid field would actually work with this.
---
Everyone can hunt now!
---
got memed hard anyway :/
---
Since it's called friendship
---
It's been going down since blackout, it was a failed experiment
---
try one of the merc groups, pirat would be my suggestion.
---
I feel like everything after "goon pets" was redundant.
---
Did you just have this pre-written?
---
I honestly love the idea of combat ceptors being an anti-fleet ceptor platform.  A claw or taranis can already apply over 250 dps... now make them easily fast enough to catch any other frigate and ewar immune, and you could comp a couple as anti-tackle tackle.  Thus the fleet that just brings 4 stilettos can hold point on bigger stuff but the fleet that brings 2 stilettos and 2 claws and both engage and disengage and control the grid on the micro-ship super fast paced level.
---
Yes and no.
---
As i said, during fleet fights there's little to no need for small-size damage dealers - so during a cruiser fight you do not see damage-dealing frigates at all, just because cruisers are accurate enough to hit everything down to frigates while possessing better dps and projection. If you do not take that away - it's impossible to give damage-dealing frigates (including combat ceptors) a role in such fights.
---
However, such approach gives game designer more tools to play with: for example, lower caliber guns have less dps and range, and they have more tracking presently; on top of that, they can have better accuracy rating which would let cruisers hit destroyers and frigates better, but at the cost of losing power against anything cruiser-sized and above (much like RLML/RHML vs their normal counterparts).
---
Wot?
---
Austin woulda been a much much better venue. San Diego, or Whales Vagina as the name translates to, is bad.
---
Truth, i left my calm, peaceful farm in south africa for Nebraska and I get massacred every day.
---
It was both, it was a ban-list of all time botting bans.
---
Ok, can you explain what I’m not getting then?
---
If only you guys could follow. Come on, you don't like this, so why do you stay and whine all the time?
---
It was just a list of bans by group, it didnt specify reason.
---
e-mail evidence to security@ccpgames.com /thread
---
I'm not sure how useful this is.  Seems like effort was applied to something that we already have indicators for.  speed and vector are only on screen (if you use tactical overlay you can see vector)
---
Just seems like they could have used that time to ... dunno... think about better ways to deal with cyno issue, or any number of other bugs that people report about, instead of something I've never once seen a request for.
---
lvl 5 missions.... much better then all the dumbasses in null super ratting, lmao
---
At least you acknowledge that nothing of value has been lost. Thanks!
---
&gt;But your ship model still stays in space and you can only be locked by clicking on the ship itself. 
---
It sounds cool, like stealth on modern vehicles (there is an in-game concord item that kinda does this), but then it very heavily depends on how good your graphics and display are. Someone with a 6-year old laptop is going to be at a distinct disadvantage to someone with the latest and greatest hardware. 
---
This is especially a problem as the scene grows more complex and fights get bigger. A much larger portion of the player-base probably can't run high LOD or various other effects (like ship trails) in the middle a TiDi fight.
---
Does not work for NPC stations. Only player owned outposts, which are all gone now and replaced with citadels.
---
They'll move you, your active clone, and the ship you are flying in (so stuff it full of stuff.). But since NPC null stations still allow you to dock after you undock, CCP will tell you tough shit.
---
km link if you're wondering
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/29682967/
---
&gt;You'd have to click on the actual ship...
---
Don't forget, when you get pointed you can right click the icon and it gives a list of targets that are putting that effect on you. Applies to most offensive EWAR, not sure about friendly effects.
---
I wonder how this story is being told be the 2 Skiff pilots.
---
Dude just go read his tweets from the month of May, There was several days worth of context involving that chart released. He talks about banning bots and botters about 5 times in a row then releases a list and states that just by being in this list doesn't mean everyone in that group is a botter, it just means they are on the top 25 list of alliances that had people in them banned for botting.  
---

---
There is nothing that explains this to a new player. This helps them understand.
---
Not pre-written but 1st two ideas have been floating around my mind for quite some time, since the moment when CCP trashed combat ceptors.
---
3rd idea emerged from discussion with /u/tikktokk/ on our corp discord like a month ago, as we were discussing "chaos era" changes, like Nanonerf during Quantum Rise which changed how webs, scrams, nanos work, and changed the missile application formula.
---
Easy heat checking/repairing or reminding you what fit you're using come to mind.

Picked up about 100, thanks CCP!
---
Yes, everyone can hunt now. I hope you agree that is a good thing. A high barrier to entry for successful hunting isn't fun and I think cuts off some of the most fun parts of the game to people who are less dedicated to it.
---
IDK we have been having fun in Metropolis and Sinq Laison, we are USTZ and can usually find a good fight.

&gt; Bullets and Missiles wider and longer than my hull should not have over 50% application.

You right, they should obliterate your hull.

But this is a game, so realism is very far out the window.

Powergrid is a bad idea, and they'll have the speed/range/dps to kite....everything.

I believe he also clarified that it was a total ban count, not a subset of just botting, but I can't recall.

You would probably make out ships much more easier with low graphics, high shader effects make it harder to see with all the effects and shit. Tbh many multiplayer games have this problem. It wouldn't be the first time players with better hardware having slight advantage.

Maybe it's just different groups of friends, I'm in no way gonna say I know everything. All I'm saying is all I can say, and that is what I've heard.

I dont know that this would work on a VM? Possibly though if your 3D drivers are configured correctly and you have the virtualbox guest addons installed.  You may just want to run the normal linux evelauncher.sh and not use steam.

One thing that doesn't go in and out of meta is human desire for convenience. I.e. import from jita and sell.
---
&gt;Edit: Aircraft bombers typically have one anti-ship weapon. I overlooked that.
---
Only at the current point in time, and that's a limitation based on the defenses of modern ships.  Bombs and torpedoes could be dropped, but the bomber would get intercepted before it could get in range.

Yes, but only they obsess over it as much as they do in their songs.
---
Are the vast majority of players really in HS? Can someone explain this. Is this a bunch of alts or is the vast majority of the people playing this game almost never heard of on this subreddit?
---
Probably not. But it made me feel better lol.
---
I see you're on a meme streak with that Widow there
---
hi (◕ᴗ◕✿)
---
Yes, it's not a lot of isk, but this is a great example of weird functioning auctions.
---
Waiting for items for a month because seller didn't bother to check back on his contract, or whatever his reason is.
---
I hear ya .... *lays down a flower onto the grave ... leans over the gravestone ... sniff .... it was nice with you Battleship PvP*
---
No, you cannot cancel an Auction once someone has Bid on the items, let alone after it's completed.
---
But it says your Corporation won. Which means the items will be in that station, in the Corp Delivery window. It won't appear in your personal Inventory.
---
All good ideas.
---
Don't know, but from now on they are gonna fit points.
---
I have a decently shield tank Drake for missions. Should I use Heavy or Heavy Assault Missiles? HAM have a lower range but they fire faster? I’m super slow in my Drake, so a bit concerned about how long it may take on missions to close the distance and fire missiles
---
&gt;And proceeds to call out someone in how they deal with their issues
---
If your way of dealing with your issues is to try and police how other people can speak and act, then yeah that's a dick move. If I get in a car accident and I insist nobody ever talk about cars because it offends me because of what I went through, that's a dick move.
---
Good point, you'd need to disable that for this particular NPC
---
Woosh
---
Nice vid.
---
It's better this way, preserves quality.
---
Why do two Americans text in broken Chinglish?

Ooph, just think, it's been there for months
---
&gt;It's entirely hiding from trauma. Rather than face your traumas or simply move along you instead latch on to a single word and try to use your personal experiences to force a set of rules on everyone else.
---
I really meant this type comment and continually telling them they're hiding from trauma implying you know how to handle their situation.
---
Like I said, I agree with you about speech police, but not so much being rude about what they may be dealing with.
---
I think they will drop them on the life server after g-fleet
---
Sort of related. Is this a bug: I bid one time on an auction contract, about 1 year ago, and I now always get the, "one contract needs your attention," notification *every* single time I log in. It's a little annoying and I can't get rid of it.
---
Biggest factor is filtration.  If you want to elevate any vodka, run it through a coffee filter a few times.
---
How is any of what I said inaccurate?
---
You underestimate the sophistication of bots
---
And breaking bedrock game fundamentals to add anti-bot tedium for real players is awful game design.

Yes sir, interceptors that intercept bombers. What a concept.
---
It's not about being accurate or not lmao. You're berating someone about how they're dealing with their issues. It's about not acting like a cunt, mostly.
---
"Yeah, we're not gonna cater to you being sensitive about words" gets the point across fine. "Stop running from it pussy, gonna talk how we want" makes you needlessly obnoxious. If you don't understand that not much point in trying to explain it more lol
---
He said shoot (kill) the HIC.

Zoomed out is terrible it's just rubbish and makes eve look rubbish. There isnt an audience at all you think there is, there isnt..

Oh stop being so dramatic and negative.
---
Fuck....
---
Haven't noticed a change in the game at all since before or after blackout.
---
Honest opinions required.  I've attempted to play Eve several times throughout the years (even as far back as the final beta phase before launch), but it's always seemed like a game I need to sink ridiculous time into.  Is that true?  Is there any room at all for people playing semi-casually?  Realistically I can play for 1-2 hours per evening.
---
i lost a lot of ships today but i still had lots of fun (✿◠‿◠)
---
maybe im playing this game wrong
---
There is (or should be) a significant amount of bots that get banned in the current ban wave (which we know it happened because CCP tp'd a bot to highsec), so of course the online numbers will of course be a little be lower. But this drop is larger than previous ban waves, which barely dented the online population count, and you will be very hard pressed to say everyone that quit was a bot.
---
Then it will come down to that "we didn't want those players anyway"... And it's an indefensible argument. Even if you are right and everyone that quit recently was a bot, if you overlook recent population changes, EVE is in a general decline since 2016 or so, excluding the 2017/18 spike due to the war. After all those insults you threw at me, it seems that you couldn't even think a bit deeper on your own arguments.
---
and claim that they needed the last 9 years to invent them with their hard dev work of 50 dudes who actually work on mobile games :P
---
You can still rat and mine almost entirely without bother in nullsec even with blackout. The people who threw a fit just need to either fleet up or find systems that are further away from their coalition's staging.
---
How difficult is it to dodge a missile that is moving slower that your ship, though.
---
Diamond rats just welcoming you to Eve is all
---
zkill link or riot
---
How is calling someone out for dealing with their personal experiences by trying to restrict others' speech the same thing as saying, "Stop running from it pussy, gonna talk how we want"?          
---
Sounds to me like you're trying to deliberately apply the least charitable interpretation possible of what I said in order to try and justify your argument.

There is no bait. Every flair is true. Cause the alternative is that someone thought that someone cared enough to know who they really are and what alliance they really are from to know that it's bait .. and that reality is just too sad to think of. 
---
All flairs are real.

I think you don't understand the meaning of "AAR" mate.

I don't think you understand the sarcasm of the title.

That's your opinion and some other people mirror that opinion, but it is not all. There is an audience, plenty of people watch both kinds. It's mostly whether or not you have voice comms on it I find. 
---
But anyway...
---
They can't. If you're cloaked you can't target or activate offensive modules. The rats weren't cloaked, OP didn't set up his overview properly.
---
Youre retarded.
---
This was enlightening, thank you.
---
Makes sense. As Darkness did some team-ups with INIT.
---
Well
---
That's a thing that happened
---
I don't think you understand the meaning of flairs.
---
So much....SALT!!

U wot m8?

How about the ability to give ships nearby a temporary speed boost. Sounds kind of like a boosting ship, but give it a long CD and higher effect. That way normal fleets would include them and a group of them could very quickly catch other ships
---
Hurry! While he's undocked!
---
You not a smart person are you..
---
We showed up. Nothing happened except one rando in a Hound. The end. :P
---
Two very different entities, unless you are suggesting brave only exists because tapi babies them.
---
Thank you for doing your due diligence.
---
At least he killed a rorq then.
---
Lol that is so bad.   At least put some effort into trying to make it look a little real...
---
I can't but if you send me your isk, I'll double it!
---
&gt;!no i wont.!&lt;
---
That's a forward operating base and they are not regular rats. They're designed to kill structures and behave like a player fleet.
---
Writing it slowly, so you understand. 
---
It is not CCP banning bots that drives online numbers to the ground. It is bots stopping to log until new ones are written by Chinese cheaters. Like the ones who use scouting pods on the gates etc. This took time, so during that period bits did not login.
---
Makes sense or apart from explaining it to you I should also understand it for you?
---
wait you logged in the game? what? is this 2012?
---
All of this and bring back cynos.
---
And in todays "news from 2017"....
---
Go back home, spod brain.

This was a funny story

haha! yeah dude! didn't get a k space to go grab those torp launchers so ended up reloading rhml a shit ton, almost lost top dps to a bomber \*facepalm\*

Eso was red for today. TEST had a bunch of Ops.
---
No, but this boot print on my ass says otherwise.
---
Oh no, I was so negative OP deleted their bad idea completely.
---
Damn, that dude's capsule is worth as much as the legion (1.3bn). Check out his most recent [loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77913889/).
---
Sounds like might have been a ghost site, or a sleeper site.  When you start to hack the ghost site you have 2(?) minutes before tons of shit spawns and you get blapped, unless you're in a tanky cruiser.  The sleeper sites spawn sleepers when you hack the cans.  Basically glorified combat sites.
---
oof, this is embarrassing.
---
So the contract wasn't in Jita 4-4, and I was waiting for the items for a month for nothing.
---
He basically lost almost 5 times as much, in what i made in total in over 6 years in EVE .... cannot even imagine losing that much within that short of time ... :O
---
Yeah, I think that was a wasted reply.  That dude was being a troll. Since the guy was decloaked and hacking the site he probably triggered sleepers.
---
How big was the imperium / legacy blob?
---
You must be very new to Eve if you’re getting this triggered over the oldest joke in the game.
---
As they should considering they are supposed to be the fastest ships in the game?
---
Loki.  It isn't as good as it used to be, but basically survived the nerf bat.
---
The legion got shit on completely, only good for overly expensive logi now.
---
was it an auction that wasn't finished by both sides?
---
Think it is not only the effect of Wow classic, but rather Wow classic+blackout. Before the blackout, you could play Eve and another game at the same time, now you can’t. And people are playing other games instead of Eve, rather then playing other games and Eve.
---
Wormhole space is dead. Folks might as well be living in lowsec if this is what passes for fun.
---
Hard to say, given how at no point in time did everyone stay on the same grid. Nothing showed up, so there was nothing to respond to.
---
Or putting it the other way, compared to the Winter Co blob, it was finitely big.
---
If CCP did this they should 100% reuse the Echelon model for it (but they probably shouldn't do it)

Tethering allows everyone to sit semi-AFK in space with no risk of me decloaking and volleying them in 3 seconds.

This is where your arguments fall on its ass really...
---
i autistically hunt bots and i can assure you most get banned relatively quickly, theres just too many.  i feel like they should automate bans. tgheb atleast the worst of the bots will be fucked up
---
Theres also an Able, its under support fighters
---
Why not just ban the bot?
---
My mistake. I assumed based on offline pos mechanics being everything that's in it can drop. 
---
And if you have 3 days of fuel in it,have to leave for 4 days there's a day of low power where it would be killable. 
---
I'd be in favor of removing day/time controls on lp citadels for sure though.
---
I think you're confusing the blue donut with the blue oyster bar and Mittani with Backdoor Bandit.

...that or you're ten years old and think "gay" is an acceptable insult in this day and age.

This should be labeled as a shit post since it shows nothing happened and OP Did not even try to really explain the total situation.

AK you mango! Made me laugh man hope you get them next time.
---
Austin Texas!!! Oh the barbecue!!!
---
Most people didn't store stuff in a POS.
---
If you are the only person managing a citadel and you have all your stuff in it, you would be pretty dumb to leave 3 days of fuel in it.
---
But I'm not against offline citadels still having asset safety, I just want them to be easier to kill.
---
I never start nothing, just i decloack(visible) and Pumm! Lot a sleeper rats invisible, just i can see the web scrambler Effect and Effect from module drain cap(that one red)

Eh. I picked up on that after hitting warp like 10 times and observing. Doesn't hurt to have it, just think there are a ton of other things that dev time and effort could be applied to.

Here's the explanation for you.

Are we sure that canceling the warp resets the timer?

Great, every minute they’re out they have a 5% chance of turning on you, then warping off.
---
Yeah. I can't seem to access the site now as it's password protected and the old forums I can't access at work, but do a google search for eve online ship crew sizes and you should get it.
---
Instead of selling sp directly, they give out free sp and drop extractor prices ;)
---
&gt; I also raised this with CCP to see their response.
---
That should be entertaining.
---
*laughs in neuts*
---
Yes, 'but' it depends on what you want to do. You can happily do a bit of PVE or PvP in an hour or two, Abyssal sites are set up for 20-25 minutes of gameplay per key. 
---
You won't be able to do easily some of the higher level stuff but adjust your expectations accordingly and find a group or make your own that understands real life is important.
---
just watch CCP release more of those fucking things like a week later as part of another log in rewards event, just in time to boost log in numbers the month of their sale bonus check...
---
Skiffs are tanky af. Few weeks ago I had a gang of 5 or so T3 cruisers uncloak on my Skiff and Rorqual and try to kill the Skiff, my Rorq's RR was able to keep the Skiff alive for a minute or so until they gave up and left.
---
Been thinking of this idea for a bit, and make them have extended dscan beyond 14.3 AU, maybe an extra 2-3 AU per interceptor skill, so up to 24.3 AU dscan range.
---
Or he could have gotten his money by running a bunch of bots.
---
OP is 100% sure it's not a overview issue. Maybe CCP is saving money by not having a model made for the new invisible drifters.
---
Oh shit i did wrong think again
---
That’s the most retarded view ever.

about that

Absolutely!
