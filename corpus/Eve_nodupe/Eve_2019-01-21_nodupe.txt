when a C1 Astra is more interesting than the Rage Keep... 
---
---
---
Pretty reasonable tbh
---
really youre gonna have enough logi t3cs and blops to tank/kill a super? how the fuck is that a small gang?
---
filling their hangers with titans... obviously 
---
I have noticed people being angry and passive aggressive not just in eve but other games lately. I think the government shut down has directly or indirectly caused people to be under serious stress and emotional strain. In my observation people from all different games and communities have been acting out of form and deviating wildly from predicted behavioral patterns. This rarely happens and it's happening now with great prevalence. Try to be patient and kind to everybody, even your enemies. The world is kinda crazy right now and just because you or I are comfortable and calm doesn't mean other people have that luxury or mindset. 
---
You should have heard me on comms, I was the Hel Pilot/Cyno. Completely unrelated to this Phoenix brave dude, waiting out fatigue.
---
I saw you in local say he had no guns, so figured I had to help. I refit to proper fighters instead of my "Oh shit use what I have loaded to save my cyno" loadout.
---
I didnt even notice he ejected the rattle initially, I continued to be baffled as to what he was trying to do... Laughing the entire time.
---
GF Suitonia a well deserved rattle.
---

---
or just put a 50mn micro on it and charge at things at 10km/s
---
I haven't played in like a month so the Nyx having a police skin is news to me.
---
Take my damn money, CCP.
---
The overview is the single most important piece of UI in the game, and the default settings are so terrible. I wrote about this back in July ( https://massivelyop.com/2018/07/22/eve-evolved-four-changes-to-improve-eve-online-for-new-players/ ) and it's not just the overview.
---
The default window placements are terrible too, like the chat window that's tiny and shoved in a corner and the local channel that's stacked in chat where you can't see the list of players in system. And the default camera settings are meant to be all cinematic but they just make the game look cheap and low-res.
---
Come check out POS Party! 
---
Dark environment gives all entities within, friendly and foe alike, a speed boost and turret range penalty
---
Since drones use the same tracking formula ad turrets, as you could imagine, they will have a very hard time at tracking targets
---
Some specific skills reduce the cpu needs of certain modules. For instance weapon ugrades reduces the cpu needs of turrets. 
---
He should get a pregnancy test.
---
I’ve been playing since 2012 and have done both wormhole and nullsec space since so don’t talk like you know shit when you don’t.
---
Man, these guides are golden. They are officially my Eve Frigate Bible for two years now. 
---
&gt; i hope one day you do a Cruiser-centric report
---
Holy crap, THAT would be amazing 
---
Yeah, but the LP value for them is trash, because the ship BPCs are worthless and the implants likewise.
---
Seconded. Like I'd light candles and pour myself a glass of wine cuz it'd be that much of a fucking treat
---
Any window that requires width, because THERE ARE NO HORIZONTAL SCROLL BARS IN EVE.  This affects most every window and makes it easy to miss information entirely because the overall window wasn't wide enough.
---
Good candidates for getting confused by this: structure browser, corp, certain arrangements of wallet or market, running low resolution in general.
---
Pocket dock up?
---
That's a pretty fucking epic night good job man!
---
Most of the wormhole corporations list their required skills/fits in the application section of their forums. You could talk a look at the corporations you're interested in and train the skills they require/the skills required for their doctrines.
---
&gt;I dont care much for reddit  
---
its like bbc news  
---
full of lies and manipulation  
---
and controlled by the wrong people  
---
I focus my time in the game and make a difference and dont need to brag about it to the whole audience.
---
From ISBoxer discord
---
Ive been screwed one too many times by bad spawns.
---
that's because they are litterally worse than those in HS.
---
HS are 2900 isk/LP ATM, delve is &lt;2700 (that's the cruor bpc)
---
Didn't say he'd be rich. Just that he'd have no competition. Maybe those shield slaves come out this millennium
---
For pve minium nestor/rattle
---
for pvp I'd recommend leshak/drek skills a long with guardian skills.
---
I can't name many groups not using those.
---
every single moon in delve occupied by a athanor. i regularly hit 100+ people mining in a system, although there's a lot of cloaky campers. shifting through the pockets i hear talk of people complaining of having too many, although that's actually intended by mittani. much easier to keep everything under a single supercap umbrella. splitting the umbrellas meant splitting the total force projected and therefore because spais and such will always be immediately exploited on. sure goons can take on all the other alliances pretty easily, but not with just 50% of their forces, and one must always assume people grouping together for one big clusterfuck. 
---
is it just me or are mods a lot less homophobic and racist now that chevis is gone
---
Well as an actual irl homosexual, It's somewhat hard for me to be homophobic 
---
Those stupid Tyrannos BS are always my worst, no matter what fit or ship I use.  It never seems to fail, I always end up taking at least one Wrecking Shot for retarded damage before I can get under their guns.  If I try to use transversal + speed from a distance, even when they're missing everything else they still seem to Wreck me once every 15-20 shots.  It seems either broken or I have the worst luck on the planet, because its only those stupid BS.
---
They're fine. It's just that the general racial bonuses you find with Minmatar are optimal for the dictor role. 
---
Flycatcher and Heretic have their uses too. 
---
Eris don't. Might need some help. 
---
Not if you live in a wormhole with a Lowsec or Nullsec static.

Low end pvp:Cloaking Astero, cov-op, Stealth bomber, intercepters, t3d, dictors, logi/ewar frigs, battle cruisers for station defense/hole camps.
---
Hi end pvp: HIC, HAC, t3c, force recon.
---
Pve C1-C2: battle cruiser, mymn/drake.
---
Pve C3 and up: Rattlesnakes/groups of Rattlesnakes.
---
Least that’s what I’ve seen.
---
That’s how I do all of my market orders and I do pretty well.
---
CCReee refuses to give the Nightmare any real skins for whatever reason, yet they have no problem giving stuff like the Asstero 10 of them.
---
I can confirm this lol. Camped an out gate from staging w cynabals for an hour or so last week for fun kills. 
---
I agree 100% with everything said.
---
idk apparently it's a thing? http://www.revelandriot.com/resources/internalized-homophobia/
---
but yay for having a diverse mod team
---
This is what we all want to see.
---
You guys recruiting? I like being logi.
---
I found a quote that described Elo Knight as ‘The John Wick of Space.’ The best fights always seem to be the ones when you feel slightly under-gunned and under pressure to get the adrenaline going, Black Legion from this video seem to have caught that. Good job, makes me want to join BL, if only Elo hadn’t quit again, someone robbed all the alliance assets and the alliance disbanded ;) 
---
This is the kind of video that we all need to see. 
---
Fantastic! Thank you!
---
I have traveled globally playing EVE at airports, hotels on different continents, and in some cases even done industry work mid-air. I've also had times where I use my work VPN and bounce through different continents within minutes of each other.
---
I have never had any issues. The key is to not use some shady VPN that will be the same VPN a bunch of botting wankers use. If you just connect from $whatever_isp you should be fine. For additional security enable 2fac on your account.
---
Title is accurate. I watched the full video last night and I'm happy I did. It really sets in just how long this drop took and how the caps got baited out. All of the things happening like cyno positioning, super movement, inhibs, timers while the fight is still going down really sets up just how good FC's can manage a lot at once.
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
Username checks out. 
---
This is a good list that covers pretty much all the layers. That low pvp group will probably be the most useful on a day to day basis and ship class wont matter as much in small stuff. 
---
Only thing I would add is some groups do armor or shield as their primary fighting force. That might play in your decision depending on skills. 
---
However eventually you will fly both shield and armor and training, especially for t1 ships, is pretty quick. Just find a group you like. That's number one. 
---
Everyone who was ratting in that area (constellation or part of a region) docked up because they didn't want to get killed.
---
I can't remember if that change was before my time or after, but I've seen the pics and I'd really love to see that reverted.
---
Jesus. Thanks for the clarification
---
quitting
---
It a little painful in the fleet, we just kept jumping gate to gate not really knowing where we were going.  It was a blast once we got to kicking in teeth.
---
I thought they did Omni damage?
---
Not what I was getting at but ok.
---
Yeah it was insane, 1500 goonswarm versus 200 Hardknocks.
---
That was all a meme we took way, way too far. Elo is very much still active and leading fleets, and Svet didn't steal anything (and is unfortunately still active as well /u/pottage7).
---
What you didn't see is the 90 minute travel time to get in position. We got sneaky tricks to catch our targets, but they take time.
---
Leshak police skin? can we make the ABC Flash Red and Blue when it fires? 
---
&gt;It reeks of irony that it's the only vexor variant not to get a police skin    
---
more proof that CCP does not play the game 
---
i mean he is literally insulting you. not sure what you're talking about
---
we are teh blob
---
it's the only way we can make up for our lack of actual skill ;.;
---
&gt; He called people out after fleet for insulting each other
---
did he call himself out for calling you retards, because that's literally what that means
---
pretty nice, man. When will you upload the vid of if, if at all?
---
hes calling people out who fuck up. maybe you like floating around with a bunch of idiot's achieving nothing. People join BL to improve and enjoy this game. getting called out for fucking up is essential in improvement.
---
but it's ok stay in your safe space if words hurt you, and you can't understand the intent behind them.
---
Is it possible for a phantasm to do up to level 4s do you think?
---
so it makes me a pussy but I'm pretty confident that improvement and enjoyment can be had by way of respectful feedback as well lol
---
but hey given your attitude sounds like you found your place. good on ya
---
Got it so I was shooting myself in the foot
---
You have 34 solo kills in the almost 11 years you played this game. And you are trash-talking other people's 'game'? Suitonia has like 8k across two of his characters.
---
Think whatever you want, dude. Every FC gets pissed. You might not hear it, but they do. At least Elo contextualizes it &amp; explains why he gets pissed. He was calling alliance members out for talking shit on each other. There's a big difference between an FC raging because people aren't listening to his orders &amp; alliance members raging at each other.
---
Hmm, that's not bad at all. Probably filter out by far most of the explo trash.
---
I can understand getting caught up in the moment. Plus if he is genuinely trying to improve his fleet and takes the time afterwards to make things better for him and the fleet then I get behind that. 
---
Kinda wish lvl 1 + 2 had their own pvp mode with lower rewards, opens up more/cheaper ships. Sure some people will just stomp people in overpriced ships but at least it won't be a regular occurrence.
---
i'm sure they do all get mad. I'm pretty new to EVE but I've played a lot of MMOs and born witness to a lot of leader/member dynamics. That the generally accepted model in EVE seems to be lashing out at people, the bar is set at "well at least he had a reason". I'm glad y'all can tolerate it, but don't pretend that it's justifiable. There's no benefit in leadership efficacy for a leader who's a cunt vs. being respectful.
---
That's disappointing.
---
&gt; don't believe someone who claims they were unfairly banned
---
i was sent 900m isk from a random account and then banned. then 2 weeks later they realized they made a mistake and unbanned me and gave me an extra 30 days playtime free.
---
The person on zkill with the most eris kills flys a 50mn fit.
---
I'd say don't criticize it till you do it. There are few things more frustrating than saying something 4-5 times and having people in fleet just straight up not listen/ignore you. Scroll up and read what I wrote again - I'm not justifying him calling people retarded. I'm explaining that I understand his frustration. Regardless the leader/member dynamics in most/all MMOs are completely different than those in eve. It's just not the same.
---
CPU is tight on eris, but I think its really more about armor being undesirable on small ships.  That being said I flew an eris this weekend in a fairly large fleet and got great reps until we started losing logi in the fight at the end.
---
I am pretty sure the Talocan had Dyson levels of technology. Caroline's Star and the Shattered Wormholes was a result of the power collection array in W477-P breaking down. Read the 'Inheritance' chronicle for more details on that one. It is also implied that the Jove (maybe the Trigs?) had technology on a level approaching that too.
---
I agree that the whole corp needs to do that, but that means always swapping to active corps and never going afk your self. Like I said, twice the effort for the same amount of fun just to ignore cynos. 
---
wait can a wolf take on an ishtar?????
---
they were immune before, makes it so a gay interceptor can't hold down a big thing
---
I mean I've been doing it for ~6 months and it really isn't different, and if it kinda is it's not different in a way that allows FC/RL rage to be acceptable. I did read what you wrote and it reads like a rationalization if not a justification.
---
Again, power to you if you're down with that sort of atmosphere. I'm allowed to find the tragedy in discovering that that attitude is status quo in a game I've become very very interested in.
---
So many wins in a row lol
---
Great job! That might be so fun lol
---
Supers: 5 per racial carrier skill level  
---
Titans: 10 per racial titan skill level
---
Aka you'd need 25 points on a super and 50 for a titan (at max level).
---
Was really after anyone who knows the reason why these hulls have those bonuses? 
---
I’m aware of what the actual bonuses are. 
---
this is correct. before the capital revamp supers and titans could only be tackled by a bubble or a hic - and heavy warp scrams didn't exist. in addition they were completely immune to all ewar.
---
with the revamp the ewar invulnerability got converted to a "ewar resistance" and the warp disruption invulnerability got converted to just a strong point resistance. this opened up cases like now where we have a team of heavy warp scram fit stratios + tackle fit rorq/dreads to bomb stuff.
---
Oh I think we all know why.
---
I love the Eris, I'll try that. 
---
So stupid little interceptors can't solo tackle a 80B ship?
---
Some people are just turds
---
Sorry it's late and I can't read for shit.
---
Because they are expensive as fuck. It wouldn't really make sense if a frig/ceptor with a single point being more or less untrackable by the large super/titan could pin it down.
---
output some of my windows to a companion tablet, for things like over view etc, 
---
yup, they are the hardest wave, followed by the drone BS which also has insane tracking.
---
In my experience you need to get very close then pulse your MWD to keep speed up high, and you need to shepherd them away from tracking towers. If you get a bunch of tracking towers, web drones and scram drones, you're fucked unless you can blitz the BS down or something.
---
Almost lost my gila yesterday to a tyrannos + 4 web + 3 scram spawn
---
While you are at it, let us Drag and Drop drugs from cargo to our hotkeys (F1-F9, ALt F1-F9 and Shift F1-F9). Basically like a module is currently.
---
Uh oh, i need more tank, let me hit F8 to consume a Strong Blue Pill.
---
That would be nice as well
---
Not all wormhole corps are hk/hawks/tdsin, etc. There's plenty of newbro friendly corps who have much much lower requirements 
---
Aren't there some offline POSes you need to bash?
---
Low class wormhole space. Rarely blobs and you’ll get plenty of good small fights in the right chains.
---
&gt; you should be fine as long as you don't log out in the US at 11:05 and log on in Russia one minute later
---
Tbh if you log on in Russia you already have more relevant problems than fear of your account getting banned, so no need to bother.
---
- a Russian guy
---
I feel like im the only one, sometimes.
---
26 and 51*
---
I like that we have designated seperated fleets, if there's a previously planned and advertised stratop you usually get about 4-5 fleets worth of pilots - and thats where TiDi sets in while burning to destination.  
---
If you add all members to one fleet and freeburn, oh boy good luck ... 10% shitfest.  
---
But you'd have to stage there right? I mean, its not easy to just reship and get back if you get podded? 
---
Come to Delve, unless you super annoy people that’s what ju just get.
---
I just orbit 8k by default almost all my fights. Web, scram, and unload your rockets and drones. Hold on tight and hope for the best. Pump you shield or armor boost until someone dies. 
---
It's a cheap enough ship to just go balls in and have fun. 
---
What's being super annoying? The biggest shit we'll fly on a roam is maybe a BC... Rest cruisers and tackle. Also we brawl... Because nano shield shit needs to die
---
o7 guys, I'm interested in Command Destroyers.  
---
I can fly all 4 empire CDs, since I trained into all T3Ds with T2 guns etc. and am quite experienced with Frigate and Destroyer PvP since I've soloed/hunted a lot in the past.
---
But i have no clue at all wich Command Destroyer or whatever is appropriate for different situations...
---
I'd like to brawl in lowsec or null and fight with Sabres etc. dupe around having fun with the corpies.
---
What'd you guys consider a good Command Destroyer?  
---
I allrdy simulated some ships and think I'll go for some 30k+ ehp Stork but I'm uncertain since it got no skirmish burst (wich I consider the most usefull)!  
---
Oh BC will draw out all kind of bugs. Cruiser or destroyer glass gets ignored pretty much. Super anointed means that you start bug supers, rorquals. 
---
Idk. I took out a fleet of 10 or 12 earlier. Ran into a Test fleet(?) Of more than us Jackdaws and a Vargur in Curse. Still stoked I kept 2 alive. Guess Saturday we hit up Venal. 
---
Ahh gotcha, no we're not into catching ratters or miners. We just want to die in a fair fire... Not a huge fireball that we stand no chance against. 
---
You're pretty safe. The list in the OP hasn't changed in the 6 or 7 years since I first trained into interdictors.  
---
Thera connections bro
---
Heavy Interdiction Cruisers.
---
Lies? Been Dicks-dayed in Delve in a 6 man T1 dessie gang
---
Depends if you are going solo or in a group. If you're in low-class holes you would eventually want to be able to fly a rattlesnake or tengu for up to C3 sites. If you are in a group that runs C5 sites, nestor should be the first one you train. Some groups run armour rattlesnakes or leshaks but you should also consider the praxis as it is just as viable and skips the battleship train time. For pvp most corps have a skill requirement that they want to new recruits to have, usually related to the ships they want you to fly but if in doubt just train into a sabre and you'll always get SRP (if you don't join a better corp).
---
Problem is we have literally no WH experience. None at all.... No knowledge of the mechanics etc... Would prefer something simpler for our semi drunk Friday evening roams. 
---
If you live in like a C2-NS/C5  its easy to get back in if podded. you generally find a decent hs/ls connection down the C5 to travel back in then just roll the ns for content.
---
Have any explo bros? They can scan you around easy enough. 
---
Secondly, I'd suggest setting up pathfinder. It'll track you through the holes, and tell you the class and WH effect, as well as percentages of the effects. 
---
Lastly have a bookmark scheme, makes it easier to know where you're going.
---
That or ask a WH group to bring you on to their coms and teach you how to Wormhole for a week.
---
Trig weaponds do thermal &amp; explosive
---
and if your cargo is too full to receive them, of course.
---
Where do I find / connect with a wh group? 
---
I live in a c4-c4/c1 and have lived in a c2-c3/HS
---
You want cov ops IV and and decentish scanning skills (atleast 100 probe strength)
---
In wormholes most ships are brawlers as you can jump through a WH and the is no aggression timer therefore most brawls take place at 0 on wormholes, BC's in general but particularly brutixes are often overlooked but they do a shit ton of dps for not much money, asteros are amazing initial tackle, fit properly they can tank while the rest of your gang warps in for the kill. Dictors are immensly useful obviously, bhaalgorns are the wormhole KINGS.  Overall depends on how much sp your corp wants but these are good starting points we start alphas out with.
---
For pve in a c3 a decently skilled RHML praxis/rattle with a deadspace booster is a good moneymaker (200mil/hr) the praxis pays for itself in about 5 sites
---
My group would do it. Hell, I kind of expect 2 or 3 others to offer seeing this. Your crew roaming C3s and C4s makes more content for everyone
---
Then you better avoid Delve... Or any places in Null-sec really, except maybe droneland...

Droneland eh? Thats not too far for us to fly. Thanks

No , you are wrong it was only 10 very hardcore Init dudes , and they achieved something truly remarkable

Ok I'd like that. How would I get in touch?

Ya if your a loser/fucked up in real life you can try again in the eve virtual life.

You'll probably be a loser there too.

Message Tevo Hyalhi in game. Im open this weekend. If that's not soon enough, I'll get you in contact with my guys.

Thats soon enough, thanks... I'll send you an eve mail as soon as i get home. 
---
Temperature tho is at the lowest just before sunset. Maybe he confused light with temperature.
---
Nice. After you guys start roaming J-space more people to get killed by! 
---
in sov-owned and upgraded space, the anomalies are much more frequent and have higher bounty payouts overall
---
because the quantity is higher, the number of escalations (and their reward) is also higher, so the overall payout is higher
---
nobody gets a /8 reserved anymore, like jesus christ ipv6 or bust brav
---
I'm counting on it... Normally I ask for pod express home after the roam... (we usually DIAF) 
---
Are you intending to live in a region or roam around? PvP Loki. PvE Tengu. Carry a mobile depot and refit nullified and cloak. You could do either in both though.
---
I mean, ofc, those are the end game goals you want to aim for, that and dread krabbing, but OP seems pretty new, he's better off starting with the lower sp shit and then moving on to the stuff you listed. 
---
And the trig ships aren't that high sp but they're a dedicated trade that doesn't contribute to any other ships, so if you're a newbro that's a lot of training time to take away from training other skills.
---
My issue is more with this being presented as minimum. OP is fairly obviously a newbro and the options presented in the top comments are far more approachable. I started in a c2 with a stratios and a c3 with a mymr, you don't need expensive pirate battleships to start making isk, or t2 logi/trig skills to be useful. Is that the end goal absolutely. But you can get involved with much less.
---
Shaks are fine honestly. It's a shame they're the only option but there needed to be something smaller groups could field to counteract the insane tank of capitals. 
---
You can't use bubbles in lowsec.
---
Pretty much. Would suggest a Nestor as well because group ratting is best ratting
---
Eh not always, I sometimes stay quiet if I gank a newbie or it wasn't really a thing. But to each their own. 
---
he used to identify as a dual prop taranis back in the days
---
Getting shitty with people taking the time to try and help you is going to get you no where. Delete this thread, have a little think and try again.
---
Not really. There was a good initial fight for hole control but once that happened there wasn’t an easy way to get in the numbers to contest 1000 ravens and shit. So they safeloged freighters of stuff they couldn’t insurance fraud and SD’d the rest.
---
I hope they all learned valuable lessons today; beautiful writeup.
---
Their little Vila Swarmer drones deal Omni damage (but not critical amounts, and the Vila ships have less Thermal/Explosive damage to compensate), and all the Drifter ships deal omni damage. Not the same threats.
---
I've been doing it for more than 13 years, so don't take offense to this but I think I might have more of a handle on just how different the dynamics are. You're totally entitled to your own opinion, I just wouldn't necessarily go bragging about how you've figured eve dynamics out after 6 months.
---
Is mining solo worth doing anymore? 
---
You'll regret it
---
We'll come to delve too
---
Not in delve, currently living in a c2
---
C5 rattle ratting is not too much of "end game" tbh. All you need is corporation with C5 static, and month worth of skill training. You can train skills further and/or make alt account to for dobleboxing, but it's just improvements.
---
Also, C5 solo Barghest farming is easier.
---
Not that newbies would do that, but nevertheless this activities is not that mysterious "end game" you need years to be able to do. Just a bit of research and about a month of training/farming.
---
lol my point was exactly that it doesn't matter whether or not the group dynamics of the two games are different. maliciously dickheaded leaders are not justifiable, it's a matter of tolerance. which we've both said and agreed on.
---
if you're tipping into argument from authority on a point that doesn't matter, I guess we're done? enjoy mate
---
Why regret it? 
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98544529/
---
It could be but the player I sent the isk to was Kirill Deway.
---
Sorry for the shitty snaps. I tried a GoSky mount for my camera but couldn't get it to work. Ended up hand holding the phone against the eyepiece.
---
Yeah, he overstated it just a wee bit.
---
He also demonstrated a Rorq can out-rep his attack on a couple Hulks.
---
Did you see what he rated as best t1 frigate in nullsec? Are you sure you don't write this? 
---
I have no experience with or around Nestors, sorry.
---
But I bet the Nestor is great for group ratting because it can fit through small holes without massing them too much.
---
That’s totally on my list of things to do now.
---
Ah yes, my Padawan
---
And the second point or scram.
---
other activities in low are more productive, like clone solider hunting and level 5 missions. If you do it right you can make more doing both than ratting in null.
---
oof
---
Chances that you will get into a trouble is a fairly low, so you can ignore it. But if you will get flagged and banned expect that it will take 4+ weeks to get resolved.
---
 Nowhere. 
---
A single nestor or snake to go on group farms is not end game. It takes like a month from very basic skills, and all the skills you need for it are useful. 
---
dont you need to corp hop some more?
---
ok yonis :)
---
99% of statistics on reddit is made up by posters by producing numbers out of nowhere
---
A great idea is to look at what corps lose and make a decision from there. You can filter losses on zkill and see most common used ships. 
---
The difference is I don't pretend or claim to be a solo pilot and brag about on Reddit. Also, get fucked XD
---
 Get gud that's how I do it

sorry, what is your argument? i said I was new. I'm not sure what idea that serves, but you're certainly hung up on it, which is kinda weirding me out. like, what you're saying isn't hard to digest - you think that after 13 years of eve, I'll be so wired-in and similarly jaded and bitter that I'll *understand* why FCs are dickheads and all will be well. I'm saying that that's still bullshit and being a dickhead is not justifiable, which I can say *completely independent of my level of experience*. Learn to fucking read lol
---
  Really wish the Talocan had more lore sometimes :/
---
 Talocan did it way before Jovians were considered cool
---
Yes. Lowsec ratting is awful, even compared to nullsec ratting. Don't do it.
---
The entire UI is the worst window for me, here's my crazy ideas to make the overview more interactive and immersive.
---
I think if the overview was optimized into a HUD/cockpit  type of thing it would be much better(your view of things in space stays the same). You basically play the game with a bunch of windows covering your view of space right now which sucks. It can change "skin" according to the ship you are flying to make it a more unique experience as you switch and upgrade ships. Maybe in it have a small pic of the ship showing heat damage etc (that would be cool). Capitals can have an extra pane on it for their jump drives with a cool spacey effect over it. 
---
Using a HUD type of thing (think dota2) let's them make the overview a bit more lively and do new things with it. You can split it into 3 parts, Chats on the left, your ship in the middle and things that are around you in the right.  
---
Stations and gates in the system should be split from the things you are targetting.  It can be under a popup for navigating to things. Default key bindings should be much more visible so people get used to playing with the keyboard to make them feel more like they are "flying their ship". (in other words do away with the selected item window), keybind the lock target, orbit, setting orbit distance, your velocity etc. 
---
Basically what I would like to see is making the ship you are flying feel more epic and unique, and prevent us playing eve with our whole screen covered in windows. Only things like the market, contracts, skills can stay external to this HUD.
---
Doing something to watch local without expanding it to your whole screen would be cool too(fellow Delve residents will know what I am talking about with 60+ people in most systems at a time). Heck let's remove local and put a system safety indicator, that changes colour according to non blues in system as a percentage, it can be lagged behind 1 minute.  It can go from green to red, changing colour as the ratios change. This would make gathering intel and dscans of enemy fleets much more important too. 
---
I would like to see CCP at least pilot test something like this as an optional overview. 
---
yeah, you bring anything to delve you're just gonna get supers dropped on you. They're not really a fan of content, just wanna krab all day
---
The penalty is a percent-of-a-percent thing.
---
Using made-up numbers for ease of discussion:
---
Let's say the target normally has 50% thermal resist, and the environment reduces thermal resist by 10%.  The result is **not** a target with 40% resistance.  It's reduced by 10% of 50%.  0.5 \* 0.1 = 0.05, so the resistance is reduced by 5%, resulting in a 45% resistance.
---
(Another way of thinking of this is it's not a resistance penalty, it's a damage boost.  10% more thermal damage into a target with 50% thermal resistance yields 5% more damage to the ship)
---
I've overstated the penalty in this example in order to make the math easier.  I don't remember the exact penalty, but it isn't huge.  Which produces a fairly small effect in the end.
---
Also, each race's drones have different speeds, damage and optimal/orbit, complicating the issue even more.  A Hammerhead missing in a firestorm is costing you more DPS than a Vespa that hits.
---
"Just use Vespas" is probably a simplification that would be slightly less than optimal in some situations.  But those situations aren't as clear-cut as "this one's a firestorm".  This also means you're not going to suffer much by matching the drone to the environment if you want to see if it works better for you.
---
I wasn't around in this early era, but do miss the animated login screens you used to get around 2013+ era - they just had more gravitas and epicness than the current static artwork style.

It is if you really do \*live\* there.

2) I've been playing long enough to have an educated and well-formed opinion on what FCs should act like
---
Pick one 
---
You seem to be too proud or too stupid to recognize that you don't know what you're talking about. Possibly both. I never said being a dickhead was justifiable. You *think* I said that, but I didn't. I said being an FC was stressful and it's easy to get frustrated, and at least Elo will explain to his fleet members why he was frustrated and what we can all do to improve, and he will apologize. But you *read* what you wanted to read. Maybe shut up and listen for a while and you'll learn something.

For the newbies here, if you're in need of help, head to Eve University chat.

So, some advice for astrophotography, to start, get yourself a cheap DSLR a T-mound adapter, and your existing telescope.  Longer exposures might be difficult if you don't have a slewing telescope, but that should get you started. I'm sorry your first foray into astrophotograph was with a gosky, but it is an amazing hobby to get into once you have some basic equipment.
---
I parked my miners in a belt and AFKed to get a [semi-decent photo of it](https://i.imgur.com/2Jx4BT5.jpg)

I was so busy with PI that I missed it.

Dont listen to this hisec pubbie. Yes you will get flagged if isk or plex moves.
---
&gt;should be fine as long as you don't log out in the US at 11:05 and log on in Russia one minute later

which is exactly what you can do with a VPN
---
Interesting, I'll keep that in mind for the next update.
---
If no cyno and short way to jita where the most important part, then we would just live in Highsec, no?
---
It's okay, nobody would confuse you for being anything useful.
---
Wow I thought the last remaining dumb dumbs in eve were gone. Guess you found the last one
---
Many variables, depending on if you're extracting in high sec (low yield) to wormholes (stupid high yield), extracting on all planets and only manufacturing T1, extracting a little less and manufacturing on each to T2, extracting to T1 then combining on one no-yield factory planet, not extracting and just buying raw/T1 to manufacture to T4, selling the end products or using them in industry to sell better stuff, etc. It's a much harder one to quantify.
---
The one benefit is that you can test it down and rebuild for something else if the market changes. I had one PI character set up to make from scratch the MTU components, which my industry character would use to make MTUs. The combined profit worked out about 800mil a month, until MTU prices dropped a bit, but then my corp started expanding and I re-focused her on fuel block components, which is only making me about 400mil a month from sales of excess blocks, but means the corp doesn't have to pay for fuel so I get a higher dividend end of the month (variable based on activities).
---
Cloudy as shit where I was. :(
---
I've heard Tama is really good for low sec ratting, especially the top belt...
---
800mil per month sigh. I easily get 800mil per day  I guess pi just isn't for me then
---
don't feel bad man, dring the solar eclipse 2 years ago a thunderstorm came in as the eclipse began. and I had such wonderful plans too... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ULxjgF58dM

Usually it's around 70% penalty so does that mean it's 45% extra dmg?
---
Or a super Carrier fleet fit with tackle to grab hostile titans from tether
---
Yeah low is pretty dead at times at the moment.
---
Why are you avoiding FW space, out of curiosity? You may find more fights there, though the risks of just finding farmers or blobbers are greater too I suppose.
---
Yes, I forgot about AFs and this statement about pirate frigates in null looks wrong in hindsight. Oh well, will fix it next time.
---
tbh the topic of frigate PvP in null deserves its own report with faction, pirate frigates, AFs, combat interceptors and maybe T1-T3 destroyers. I only wanted to show that null sec frigate PvP is different from FW.
---
Present! Ask your question soldier.
---
You either have flair, or you don’t.
---
Besides the usual Gila fits, I've also been having reasonable success with a mwd + heavy pulse Zealot fit. Finished up to lvl 4 electricals, but not sure yet if it can survive all spawns.
---
The agency.
---
For some reason I’ve never seen many people grind null rally points. It’s always carriers and supers in havens and sanctums.
---
If there was no killboards there would probably be more objective based gameplay and teamwork in pvp than what you get now. That's how games used to work anyway 20 odd years ago. Before stats being recorded for everything became the norm.
---
Black Rise is a little busier but more chance of getting blobbed
---
Modules follow a pattern. DEDs are separated by frig/cruiser/bs (noted by the bpc they drop).
---
A-type mods either drop in 3/10s, 6/10s, or 9/10s (which technically are unrated, not 9s) depending on size/type of modules.
---
Doesn't matter which sec you are in. 
---
Thanks for the info. But i wonder though, i saw that there is a cap on how much money you can make. I have a different method of making money around 1b isk/hour. And that includes all downtime. I can run whenever i want and i can do it 23/7 if i would want to. I could even add some extra accounts and go up to 1.5-2 b isk an hour. 
---
Is this dread wormhole farming really better? 
---
"Lets poke this beehive in hoping to get a fight". 
---
Waffles, skill urself, &amp; purple helmed warriors. Are ones that come to mind, though idk if they are recruiting or not.

I guess if you can't find a fleet you have no other way to do it

Which wormhole corp will you move in ? maybe you can get their skills requirements

Yellow bar is actually tied to win rate, not tier. So for ship with 50% win rate the bar will be at the middle of semicircle. 
---
This is the remnant of old design from 2015, when tiers were more or less tied to 1v1 win rate. After that I learned that win rates are good indication of strength for T1 frigates, less so for faction frigates and fairly meaningless for pirate frigates, even when I control the sample for various non-PvP kills and losses.
---
So now the tier is simply my opinion about the ship. When win rate conflicts with my first impression, I simply ask someone competent to fight me over and over in every popular frigate and fit until we come to some conclusion about the actual strength of the ship in practice. This was the case for Damavik, for instance.
---
I dunno how you can draw that conclusion based on the outcome of one battle in which TEST lost recently. N = 1  is hardly a scientific analysis of their strength or power.
---
I mean, the alliance name speaks for it itself, its just a TEST, please ignore all the lolz and fails.
---
Thank you. This is a great.
---
... I've never seen the actual numbers of just how ridiculous a rorq is.
---
To ***EQUAL*** the amount mined by a solo rorq, you'd need 3 hulks boosted by said rorq.
---
Aside from isk, there's no reason for miners to use barges/exhumers unless they want mercoxit. That's just totally nuts.
---
I can't even.
---
/u/StainGuy will buy it from you if he gets a way to take it out you know... like a lowsec gate or something....

Is it R64 tho?

there is so much that needs a balancing in this game :/

Amamake and Akidagi have good content. They're both fw zones (amarr-min and cal-gal respectively). Go there, sit in a novice and wait till someone warps in. If you dei, message your killer to know what you could've done better. More often than not, they'll give you tips on how to git gud.
---
How bout' a Police Orca? Porca. Year of the pig 2019
---
I think Exotics are better, since they go hand in hand with Gila's missile bonus damage and ofc in general a resist hole on enemies is nice to have. But sure, III or IV gammas can probably mean you can bring a cheaper fit, probably works very well with passive fits because of the extra shields. Clear times will be slower though because of no resist hole.
---
It would be spin, except for the wee little fact that at least half of all the fleets of gone on, it appears to be all too true. The other half the time, it appears that NC. docked brings a full on fleet when we're bringing a small stealth bomber harassment fleet but when we bring a full fleet, they never undock. Having observed this behaviour time and again, I've drawn this conclusion.
---
Armor is the retarded way of spelling it.
---
98,837% to be precise
---
Why can interceptors solo tackle raven state issue or etana though? 
---
See explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ahwsef/novice_frigates_yearbook_2019/eels5ec). Basically some strong ships have low win rates (especially kiters - Slicer, Garmur), and some weak ships have high win rates (Damavik). Some sources of this bias: 
---
1) skill (good players using rare underpowered ships tend to skew win rates above norm, and vice versa);
---
2) game mechanics (lowsec gatecamping in Daredevil with Exequror alt generates a lot of 'solo' killmails, for example);
---
3) manipulation (killing own alts).
---
Lol. You didn't do anything in this video though, this is literally just the fc and a bunch of worthless f1 pushers
---
I used to have exploration frigates in this report a few years ago, but I removed them when I started working with the data seriously. [u/Devilrodent](https://www.reddit.com/user/Devilrodent/) already gave a good answer - it's difficult to control the sample for non-PvP fits. Technically it's doable, just a lot of work.
---
And put them into concord lp store! There is only comet 
---
Congrats you scoundrel :)
---
Interesting on player retention. I wonder what the stats would be now as that was 3 years ago but I take your point.
---
Individuals who engage in high sec aren't playing the game wrong. In fact, groups who engage in high sec aren't playing the game wrong. In fact, I didn't say anything was "wrong". There is no wrong or right in EVE, there is only opinion and my opinion of large groups of player who spend all their time ganking and harrassing people in high sec is that they are pathetic. CODE are like that high school clique who think they're awesome because they can pick on any of the other kids they like because there are more of them and they know when they can get away with it but really, in the grand scheme of things, they're actually a bunch of ass-hats who, when ejected from school into the real world, discover that they're not actually tough or hard but in fact just pathetic ass-hats. That's why CODE are in high sec. Because they know that if they ejected themselves from high sec they wouldn't be able to swing their cocks around because they'd get kicked in. So yeah, their sort of behaviour is pathetic.... in my opinion.
---
As for what makes high sec so special, it's inate in the game rules and you know precisely what it is. My issue isn't with the ability to gank people in high sec. That's perfectly fine. In truth I don't actually have an issue with CODE. They can do what they want but my opinion of them as prepubescent bully-boy scardy cats is unlikely to be changed unless they stop being bully-boy scardy cats which they won't so yes, I think they're pathetic. 
---
planned for a decade at least
---
No, the factor by which your damage increases depends on the enemy ship's resists before-hand, so you can't just directly translate reduction to resistance to a damage increase like that. For example, if a ship has 99.999% resist before the penalty, and 
---
    99.999 * 0.30 = 29.9997 ~= 30
---
after the penalty, then you went from doing 0.001 damage to 70, which is an increase by a factor of 70,000!
---
The more resists they have before reducing them, the more you'll feel the difference. 
---
&gt; **Hk evicts krabs** and people that encourage them, like outlaws and dura lex. You **hit their bear holes**, you can't complain they hit you. 
---
That's brilliant.
---
the secret pass phrase is ''blood and iron'' w changed it last week. Geez u guys...
---
For ships that produce a lot of 1v1 killmails (T1 frigates, combat faction frigates), I use aggregated data from Eve-Overmind.
---
For rarely used ships (ewar faction frigates, pirate frigates) and recently rebalanced ships I usually scrape data directly from Zkillboard.
---
Those fits are terribly wrong. to find fights I warp to plex and shout: death to Gallente in local.
---
I sent him mail asking for 100b and never received reply :(
---
Lowsec belts: max. 1 BS (Battleship) rat with about 800k bounty + cruisers spawn and its uncommon for a BS to spawn at all. 
---
0.0 belts: max. 3 BS rats with up to 1.7mil bounty per BS + cruiser/BC spawn, quite common, the better the truesec the better the spawns (-1.0 is best, look on [Dotlan](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Providence#sec) for info)
---
If you want to beltrat and dont want to join an 0.0 alliance right away you could rat in npc 0.0 (try syndicate, its really quiet there).
---
Combat anomalies is best done in sov 0.0 space as other have said already, but its the best payout for "normal" ratting. Highsec mission running is a good alternative to start the game and get some money. Its good fun to get to know the different missions and rising in standing to get better paying missions. Just dont do it for too long ;)
---
\- Restore RGB sliders and Neocom colored icons (or better : make them customizable by players. It is just few vectored files...).
---
My main concern is readibility, but the very dark interface make me often miss the Close crosses for just one exemple of how bad it is... and I am still confused by the Neocom icons after all this time.
---
\- Oh and... if I can take a second one, give an option to get big icons at all time in the Selected Item overview panel , like it was in 2005/2006... before they switched to this broken "automatic" system who make them small nearly all the time. Automatic != good (not always). I have to waste precious screen space to get usable icons in this panel.
---
They won't understand, all of them are chinese now 
---
Sorry to say dude, but you won't get a good small gang brawling fight in Kspace, everyone will juat blob you, that's why everyone kites. You can try small aliances in Querious, but other than that, no chance.
---
I'd love to see the jackdaw get a police skin!

The reason is isk/h. You den't got much bounty while grinding down hubs, hoping for escalations and the droprate of A-Type Invuls or A-Type EANMS are low. Traveling to the 6/10 and running them take also some time.
---
don't worry about skills or fitting. Just read/understand [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes), get your Astero/Strat ready, choose a c2/c3-corp for the start and plunge in. Anything else (bubbles, rollers,logi,rattle,pi, etc pp) is extra ...
---
Welcome to WHs
---
First, Null has the better anomalies. Heavens and Sanctums are only in Null. Forsaken hubs and rally points may spawn in LS, but quite rarely. If you find one, it generates exactly the same NPCs and the same income as it would in Null.
---
That's the second point, then: If an anomaly is done in Null, it will respawn in the same system after a short delay. In LS, it will ususally respawn somewhere else, so you can't stay in the same system and do one good anomaly after the other.
---
On the other hand, the Null style ratting is not the best method for everybody. It's a very reliable income, but ISK/hour is ok, not great. It feels like work at an assembly line.
---
People in LS have more active methods of generating income: DED sites, belt ratting (mostly for Clone Soldiers), burner missions, ...  These are less reliable, you may have a bad day and earn very little. But there are also very lucky moments, where you make more than a billion in a single site. On average it's better than Null -- IF you can run your activities without being attacked to often. That's the biggest problem of living in LS.
---
Hmmm I created the logo so... that... occurred ... and... this is a little awkward now... 🥺😏
---
Go back a little bit further to a time when no jump fatigue and with a full capacitor fit you could jump in right next to a hic in low sec and jump out before your invulnerability expired...
---
Them were the good old days
---
To add to that, escalations may not always be possible to run as a newer player. Being in a social structure in null often makes selling the escalations to other players possible too.
---
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!
---
GTFO i hate frigates.        
---
The loss is important by itself for numerous players, I agree on that. But the lossmail add the **shame** to the mix. You can't opt-out of both, so at least one should have positive effect.
---
PAPs have replaced killboards on the tracking point of your argument.
---
The last sentence is totaly wrong in my opinion. The most fun games I had was mostly in no-score servers.
---
Phantasm is probably best for electric sites, although the gila can do those up to t4 fine too
---
I'm really not sure as I don't fly the Phantasm, but the Sacrilege is ideal for dark sites and turrets are subpar for all 4s and 5s as the best strategy is usually kiting certain things. Drones and missiles are definitely superior for Abyssal Deadspace, once I figured out the l5 Gila fit I never tried anything else.
---
Wow ty.
---
The asset safety ui
---
Call me stupid but since when did Suitonia join Horde, I thought he was goons?
---
Call me double stupid because after 15 years I learned you can steal ships in this game, lol.
---
Currently most of the PL is in Snuff 
---
You mean so a group of stupid little interceptors can now tackle a 80B ship? Before they got the warp strength, they were right out immune to them, except for bubbles and Dictors
---
I have like 10 rattles in Stain - don't worry. 
---
Cheers mate. Yeah i think we'll give roaming in WH space a go
---
he'd have to log in for that
---
Plenty, but unless players point those issues - nothing will change. 
---
I think that players grow too accustomed of killboards to be able to imagine a life without.
---
But there is no need to remove them.
---
CCP just need to give an option, so the player can "opt-out" of them. I mean by that... It won't remove the lossmail, but the player name of the loser will be hidden (NOT his corp, NOR his alliance). This way, killboards remains useful but the players who opt-out don't get any history to be shamed off.
---
Of course, said options can be disabled/enabled at any time, with a 24 hours delay (or it will be used for bad reasons :) ).
---
I don't think it would make stupid fits widespread, as directors and CEOs know their members... it would still be easy to track who is the wrong guy.
---
The only real consequence would be about SRP systems of alliances... because an "hidden" player WON'T have any rights to be SRPed, making said system more financialy stable :) Choose... potential shame, or ISK ? &gt;:)
---
i hope you like scanning

Same with sanshas

My advice is try kiting :)
---
Will be fun trying

---
NICE TRY
---
I mean I don't know what your doing to really compare there can be some downtime with dread krabbing if you talking like the triple dread method shown above.
---
ham sacriledge with dual 13-14km webs is top tier for darks. be sure have at least 500 dps for lvl 4-s
---
Tried it. Not fun kiting If everyone else is also trying to kite you 
---
Not really, nullseccers usually bring light tackle and a bunch of kitchen sink ships. That's why kiting is prefered, you can above gangs above your numbers/class.
---
Still, if you wanna brawl, I recommend fast ships like cynabals or dramiels with skirmish links, cuz in null mobility wins the fights. And try Querious, around "K7D" system (dunno the exact name, but you'll find it)

Is it just me are the bpcs you get from abyssals not worth it to manufacture? It seems like you would loose money after taxes or make a very small profit. Am I missing something?

And they were nerfed twice (i think) already. They used the hace nore yield than 5 hulks.
---
Yo. CCP has forgotten there is a 'new' map. Let's keep it that way. 
---
Ye, watch out of the part belonging to goons tho.
---
I'd advice against it, unless you are in a fairly protected situation in a rorqual. 
---
On the other hand, as long as you are having fun...
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Cool thread. As someone looking for a nice active corp, anybody got recommendations for an active WH corp for an experienced PvPer?
---
Arent most of the C2 with NS/C5 statics highly vied for?
---
I think I've seen a handful of empty ones. could go with a C2 with a NS/C6 static too.
---
A tiny nitpick, but the Tristan speed nerf and the Rifter slot change both occurred in Fall 2017 (Lifeblood), rather than the Fall 2016 shown on the timeline.
---
Echoing what everyone else said here though, it's really useful to have all this information put together nicely like this. Add my thanks onto the much deserved pile.
---
It has to be done by SB-battleships. Rally points spawn only small crap and 2 cheap battleships at the end - a VNI makes only 3-5M ticks there, and the small chance for an escalation can't turn this. Same carriers - bounties are way too low to make it worthwhile. But all these destroyers, cruisers etc. die very fast to smartbombs.
---
A few people specialize in this. But I figure the bigger source of invuls are not escalations, but the scannable DED sites - and 6/10 spawn a lot more often in LS than in Null.
---
Go to Kinakka.
---
Was that not a bug?
---
I think i Read something about to fix it 
---
Dont know... I did it on my 47mil main and my 10mil alt and all 4  1mil cyno toons... All got about 250k SP in total
---
It depends on if the Ishtar is smart enough to swap drone damage type on you. If he stays with praetors it's not a problem, if he swaps to warriors or any heavy type of non EM you need to run. 
---
I agree but still, nothing does change or very rarely!
---
The Industry window randomly deciding not to apply structure rigs when previewing jobs tilts me off the side of the earth.
---
Ha. So very true. EVE has conmen (conpeople?), traders, industrialists, miners, pirates, millitary, political elite, middle management, lowly workers and everything else life has in general terms. It has villains and heros and everything in between.
---
Dependes on what your doing with the ore were you mine and what ship your using I recently started mining in provi with an alt while main ratted and got around the same amount of minerals for a lazy week of as you would get for a hardcore month in high
---
I've not checked the calc, does it take drone travel time in to account? Last I looked after you did that it was closer to two hulks.
---
Make sure you're using the FW maps to get an idea of which areas are most active:

Just fyi. GPU usage is relative. If you have a process taking 10% GPU usage, and the card clocks down, the usage will rise.   
---
I don't know how you messered it. But maybe the GPU just clocks down because it's not needed in vsynced eve?
---
VPN is officially okay.
---
If you want to run T4 Dark Abyss in a Gila you will need to switch your fit completely. Go with active, not passive, bling it a bit, faction DDAs and at least a C or B type rep and invuln are a must. Once you do that, you will have the space to stick a drone optimal rig in there, keep the other 2 rigs shield rigs ( preferably solidifiers ), and stick 1 tracking computer without script, just by itself.
---
Use Augmented Vespas as default drones, Augmented Hammers for battleships exclusively, forget all the other drones, don't even bother with them.
---
If all you do is stick to Gamma and Exotic filaments you will cut your income extremely, sometimes it will go into negatives on bad drop RNG and considering filament costs. T4 Gamma / Exotic income is just slightly better then running regular plain old L4 security missions due to filament costs.
---
Also, I try out electrical and fire in active fit Gilas, you do need to switch to active fits but don't need the extra optimal / tracking for your drones. In fire, you need to have a fit with 3x DDAs, 2 doesn't cut it due to NPC armor bonus and drone DPS being too low, but you can get rid of the drone tracking and drone optimal stuff on your ship. Switch drone composition to 6x Augmented Vespa, 4x Augemented Hammers, use Hammers on BCs and some cruisers as well as Battleships, rest Vespas.
---
Electricals are very easy to do on active Gila because with the extra cap regen you can make an XLSB or double solidifier A-type fit cause you get all that extra cap regen. Really easy to hit 140-150 HP/s and still be perfectly stable. If you do your fittings in PYFA or other extrenal tool, do not confuse HP/s with EHP/s. Ignore EHP/s because its false as it gives numbers in combination with resistances, focus on HP/s. Cash from Electricals is OK but not great, you get to sell all your exotic / gamma filaments which adds to income, but they tend to drop mostly neut mutaplasmids which are not worth as much as other mutasplasmids so you get a bit less there. Its kinda in middle between fire and Gamma I'd say.
---
Thanks for the explanation! Cheers
---
Filtered by price instead of jumps?
---
I think it buys from top of market details depending on how you have filtered 
---
"Come to delve"
---
You guys are so desperate for content that my astero got chased down for 15 systems and finally died to a super. We also brought a frigate gang two times in delve and both times supers were waiting us on our way back. Delve is the worse region to roam in.
---
Explo right now is kinda crap for money, and often times you will be competing with bots, so I can't recommend it. I used to do it quite a lot and still do some WH diving once in a great while to break the monotony, but its definetly not for ISK.
---
If you already have full VNI skills, then just go Gila, Rattlesnake, Loki, or Gila Loki Rattlesnake, and you'll be set.
---
 
---
NPC Null sec, Stain, Syndicate,Venal pockets of  PureBlind, Fountain , the most fun places in Eve. As a small gang pvper I've lived in all of them and have always enjoyed my Eve life. I never cared about the capital menace , the rorquals, supers , you just do your own thing.
---
You clearly have rocks inside your head
---
I woke up at 4.45 am out of the blue and remembered about this, totality was at 5.12am my time so was very lucky.
---
We are a actually close to pure blind. Will poke around there later. Thanks
---
Saw from my office. Forgot to make sacrifice for blood moon though :(
---
One of them is ISK positive.
---
I'm new to pvp as well but Ive been rekt by Tristans with ancillary reps, tech 2 drones, and some sort of damage in the high slots. I'd recommend dropping the shield tank in favor of more dps but if you have to add tank to your ship add armour tank. Because I don't fly Tristans I don't know what to tell you to put in the high slots other than neuts. A lot of the ones that killed me usually used light auto cannons on me for just added damage and had 1 neut just to add to the intensity. I'll go through my zkill to find an example.
---
As for systems to roam I feel you're podding yourself  trying to avoid content in FW space. To my understanding it's where everyone goes to find fights regardless of faction alignment. If I had to take a stab in the dark however I'd say roam in LS systems close to large trade hubs. 
---
People I've used to help me learn how to pvp:

Minchurra https://www.youtube.com/user/irksomebadger

Hope I was able to help
---

---
 I wonder if it might help if a Rorqual couldn't pilot its own drones. Just assist each of them individually to a Hulk (or other barge) and each barge pilot could only have a single excavator assisted to them.
---
then you would need five barges per rorqual in the belt / anom.
---
lots of dead space around there, you could end up roaming 4h without a fight if you don't know where to go exactly, dronespace requires regional knowledge or good tacklers and holding ratters hostage.
---
Maybe we'll hold off for now, but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks 
---
Thank Jove for the free reps on citadels! 
---
It doesn’t hurt. I told CCP I use a vpn because I’d heard of people getting banned, they responded with a “thanks for letting us know”. 
---
I use https://evepraisal.com/
---
You can always repair it with nanite paste and see how much \*that\* costs
---
In and around Black Rise isnt too bad. Lots of GalMil to blap :P
---
&gt; Just whatever you do join a big group
---
You can't give advice like that in a game like EVE. Big groups aren't for everybody.
---
Didn't care much about the lunar eclipse, but the halo the last few days was p cool. Impossible to get a photo of though :(
---
Implying the widow base skin isnt already gorgeous ;)
---
Yes, of course they can improve the tech as well as they can improve coding. However, that would only allow a bit of a smoother gameplay until we manage to drop another 2k ppl onto the grid and we fuck it up, once again. And updating always has risks, some of which they cannot manage (helly my friend "chat"), which is probably why they don't improve in rapid succession XD
---
I guess (and also according to CCP) the easiest and fastest way to make large scale combat more smooth, is scaling down the amount of information. There is alot of information that is important to the immediate surrounding players, but not important to the campers on the gate. For such information, the "grid" could be decreased. Additionally, some broadcast information like Player A gets the information that X scrams Y, is rather useless in a very large scale battle, you only care about the vectors you get in your overview... And I think this also runs via the main combat thread. They could start to ignore this as soon as the battle hits 2k entities (incl drones ofc), they would have deleted immediately one exponential growing source of load.
---
Lowsec caldari faction warfare in Black Rise would be your closest/best. Amamake in minmatar FW lowsec is another great area. Concentrate on these two areas IMO.
---
Nullsec
---
Syndicate is probably your closest bet. 
---
Providence in ustz (NOT EUtz) can be ok.
---
Querious (NOT NEAR DELVE) can be ok.
---
Curse can be ok. Catch you will probably be blobbed.
---
Venal will probably suck. You might get lucky, but it's generally going to be quite shit.
---
Outer Ring will be boring for you but it might have content if you manage to tackle something long enough.
---
The drone regions are full of bots. They will either blob you in capitals or let you kill whatever it is you managed to tackle. 
---
In Branch, Ranger Regiment can be fun BUT do not fight them in Chinese TZ. Bring a sabre if you choose to go to Ranger Regiment sov. Siberian Squad will also fight you, but again don't fight them in Russian TZ.
---
Geminate can be fun if you don't get too close to Horde's staging system.
---
Vale is mostly bots except for 1 constellation only: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Vale_of_the_Silent/BUG6-X#const
---
Do not go to any region where a huge nullsec alliance lives in their main tz (time zone).
---
Do not go to Delve, Esoteria, Deklein, Paragon Soul.
---
As a general rule, do not waste your time in the sov of these alliances: Ncdot (bots), Pandemic Legion(bots), GOONS(blob), TEST(blob), Fraternity(bots and blob), Darkness(bots and blob), Kids with guns(bots), Skill urself (bots), Hard Knocks (bots), 
---
That's \*\*his\*\* point though? 
---
With the help of an example he just wanted highlight that ISK value has not much to do with the bonus. In contrast to what It'sGoodForBitcoin said.
---
Querious is a complete waste of time for what your looking for.
---
This feels like a post by someone who spent 2 weeks in a C3 with a Stratios and a mobile depot.
---
Its times like this I log off before my luck runs out lol.
---
Hah! Nice idea, I'll try that, kinda curious 
---
Thank you for your excellent reply. We'll be staying clear of RR and SibSq on account of being blue :) 
---
I agree that my alliance usually blobs everything (darkness) but as my corp is one of the few EU/USTZ corps, we tend to see little to no action.
---
Horde can be fun, but seeing as they have lots of our reds deployed there, i think we'll be staying away for now.
---
I will definitely have a look at black rise and syndicate for sure. 
---
This was an R128 moon. 
---
You'll be amused.  Report here just for the sake of it
---
Or pvper.

WTB EREBUS POLICE SKIN WHOOP WHOOP
---
Thanks! Yes, looks like I mistyped a year when I moved this information from Excel to Powerpoint addon for these timelines.
---
It depends, if you fit and position right you should have very little travel time.
---
There is a constant traffic of enemies and unknowns passing you in lowsec.  In null, you can easily have the entire system to yourself and several minutes warning before anyone unfriendly shows up.  This makes null far safer.
---
  Fancy alien tech costs alot who would've thought 
---
uhm FYI cycle time on ice goes down to like 16 seconds or so. they barely go away before they have to come back to drop off.
---
Have you thought that cycle for Ice Harvesting drone is so quick that the drone does not have enough time to make an orbit. Remember, Ice Harvester drones do not mine X ice in 60s cycle, the variable here is the cycle duration to mine 1 block of ice. If you were to post a video of the same behavior for regular ore mining then that could be used as a proof. Otherwise I think you're just panicking :)
---
You know that these are not normal rocks, but ice. The cycle time is reduced.
---
I don't want to deny your find - eve can be quite easily scripted **but i don't agree with this** :             
---
&gt;It is unrealistic that a player would manually micro manage all five excavs individually like this                 
---
Seriously have you ever tried a super ratting?              
---
It is a nightmare requiring you to click almost every second - if not you are doing it wrong and get around 50% of possible payout.         
---
I should say that we still use blops pretty regularly, i'm still #2 for the deemer on zkill.  However the nature of the game has changed and the hulls themselves don't make nearly as much sense to use as they used to despite the fact that they haven't seen a balance pass.
---
Mostly I put my own apathy directly on the feet of the T3 changes; blops hunters are only 30% of the ships they used to be and there are no alternatives that make any goddamn sense to use at all.
---
faction supers is 30 and titan is 60 i maybe wrong but yeah theres only 2 ships that can tackle a super which is HiC and youd need 2 rorquals for a titan in lowsec anyways for null just use a sabre bubble
---
That's one of the most interesting ideas I've seen so far tbh. 
---
lol I guess you never ice mined in a rorq with excavs before? Maybe next time check how they work before declaring people cheaters becuase you don't understand the mechanics
---
TL;DR: In this post, OP makes a huge number of assumptions without a full understanding of the game mechanics and therefore (likely incorrectly) concludes that another player must be cheating. 
---
or not too long ago jump a capital to any citadel and get insta tethered.
---
Well, I can only say keep an eye on your dscan.

---
I have also done some ratting in carriers, and know what you are referring to. This could be realistic if they were only trying to micro manage *one* rorq's *five* excavators. 
---
There is no way they are controlling 10 to 25 excavs at once though.
---
oh yes. they also removed a ton of information that was visible before at first glance and now has to be dug out from the info window (like primary and secondary attribute and training time multiplicator)
---
Two nestors can do most of C5 anomly and scale better than rattlesnake as they are remote rep
---
I have done plenty of rorq ice mining to know that this is not the natural pathing of excavs.
---
&gt;It is a nightmare requiring you to click almost every second
---
fuck webbing frigates in sanctums
---
....What did you do?
---
I did some C3 solo praxis and some C5 dual praxis.
---
I got a shitload of drone aggro of both but barely experienced this with the dual nestor
---
I have not only done a lot of rorq ice mining myself, in order to know the difference, but I have also spent a lot of time looking at other non-botting pilot's ice excavs moving about.
---
You get plenty of time to analyze your enemy when you are cloaky camping ;)
---
It's always dead TBH 
---
you forgot the most important part that is wrong with the beta map: the granularity of the heat map when looking at information. i can't tell if it's 100 players average in space or 1000, looks the same.
---
obligatorily paging /u/suitonia
---
Ice excavators don't have long cycle times you're bad and should feel bad the excavator behaviour is done by the game itself
---
Why am I not surprised that a goon member is being defensive...
---
Why you didn't stfu when you don't know anything? I lived long enough in wh space. 
---
you can be lucky and get 3 minutes maximum timer
---
Recently in higsec there is a lot of alpha characters that are looting stuff.         
---
You could say what is wrong with this - well i recently noticed a guy that managed to loot multiple wrecks before they even showed for me.          
---
I'm all for banning anyone who bots but I think these guys are using the omni tracking fit so the drones never go around the rock. VoV
---
"I AM AN EXPERT GUISE, LISTEN TO ME"
---
Then you should know about these great things called the Drone Navigation Computer I
---
He seems to like small gang so we may get some more "friendly " fights goin on. No issue for more content
---
I have seen plenty of other ice excavs in action to where these looked fishy in comparison. I should have posted a video of the non botting version to show side by side.
---
Almost definitely? Afaik it's a 100% certainty, that it's going to be an extra server.

Dont leave me hangin BR!

Relax buddy, it's gonna be ok =)

Whens the last time you used it?

Sucks when you just relize a rare moon is shining. Its incredible and you snap a photo with you phone and its just a bright blob. Feels real bad
---
go and try to be competitive in wow, you need months of bloody grind only to start being competitive.
---
in eve you can put a day 1 old characters in a slasher and be more useful then yet another 60m SP ferox F1 monkey
---
12 seconds ^^
---
Why am I not surprised that a guy who made a fool of himself on Reddit can’t admit he was wrong?
---
Thats pretty good. Keep at it and you'll surely get fights. Roaming around helps a lot, do you use dscan? That can tell easily whats close by in the said system, so any T1 frigates seen on it is a good indication there might be something offering a fight.
---
I would most likely switch the drones from hobgoblins to warriors since they are the fastest light drone out there. Rail guns or energy neutralizers in highs. First one gives more damage, second one offers you possibly a way to live if something catches you close range.
---
Clouds are some bullshit :(
---
&gt; Also, C5 solo Barghest farming is easier.
---
Btw,how does solo raven/bharguest work?
---
&gt;Evictus. hate boner (LORDE hates Evictus)
---
but everyone hate evictus...
---
Meh, im fairly sure you could do that with a program like eve-o or isboxer, and just constantly cycling. more effort than its worth, but doable.
---
bee man bad
---
I'd support a bonus that eliminates the CPU penalty of WCS when fit to supers/titans, that way I can still have my other mods online when I unfit my tank.
---
*shudder* ... Why did they ever think *that* was a good idea?
---
I've read before that orcas are intended to be comparable with exhumers in yield - in practice when theorycrafting, it seems to be somewhere around a unboosted procurer's yield. Not exactly awe inspiring, that.
---
How exactly did CCP go from *that* to the 5xhulk yield rorq?
---
This just seems nuts. Was there even an *attempt* to balance it or did they deliberately make it OP for the sake of being OP?
---
pointing out game mechanics is triggering now?
---
so pointing out your complete ignorance of a game mechanic that has you calling people cheaters is goons being defensive...
---
When you say web kite, are you talking about an AB/Scram/Warp disrupter fit designed to fight out at 13 KM?
---
&gt;be turboautistic
---
&gt;make accusation against group
---
&gt;group replies with something that goes against your accusation
---
&gt;call group out for not automatically agreeing with you
---
I never did it myself, but AFAIK principle is based on exploitation of sleeper aggro range "feature". This is a long-standing bug (it's been there at least several years) which was never acknowledged by CCP and thus exploiters never took any punishment of which I heard of.
---
You need a Raven or Barghest with autotarget missiles with 400km attack range. First use a cloacked ship to make bookmarks on sites (data or relics signatures, ignore anomalies) 400km away from sleepers. Then acquire NPC aggression timer somehow (like warping in, taking a shot, warping out). Then you just warp to your bookmark and press F1 and then you just wait for sleepers to die.
---
Sleepers would not attack or chase you, also they would not repair eachother. They would not even move. If they started to move - you should go away because they do so only if cloaked ship warped on grid near them. So they are basically an alarm for you now.
---
Are these thoughts for Null or Low?
---
I understand your point, and it's a good one, however, I don't think that the time spent mining is thrown away if you call them back and then send them out again to mine, without pulling them back to your drone bay.
---
So they can mine for 6 seconds, pull them back, and then let them mine for another 6 seconds, thereby meeting the 12 second requirement.
---
It's their cycle time. Why do you think they only start returning after the laser shuts off? That's their cycle time ending. Also just time it after you record, frame by frame if you refuse to believe. I did it for the first two vids and the time between their direction change is pretty much 12-13s on the nose.
---
I think that's just an Arnold quote. 
---
Or the script is pulling them back halfway through their cycle time, so the excav remains close, and then sending it back out again to finish the remaining cycle time. 
---
Again, these excavs are not being pulled back into the drone bay at any time, so they can just split their cycle times in order to stay within immediate pull back range.
---
OP doesn't like it when people use scripts to cheat in an MMO =)
---
They'll go around if you get too close to the rock. For rorqual ice mining you want the sweet spot where you're far enough away that they bounce between you and the rock for the 12s. It's just math of their mining range and speed.
---
So do I, but I've recieved "gfs" after getting my ass ganked violently.
---
That's not how cycles work for ice. You can't do partials and re-continue. Also the lasers in your video stay active the 12-13s, they don't stop for recall at 6-7s.
---
Try things out on the test server. Great way to learn how the game works. 
---
I do my own rorq ice mining.
---
X for doubt.
---
7bn/mo with the best doggo pics around
---
&gt; What makes it more blatantly obvious that this is botting, is that when I see this happening, it is 2-5 accounts doing it at once. There is no way a player is micro managing 10-25 excavators at once in this manner!
---
So basically you're convinced its botting, because a bunch of people are mining in a fleet, and doing it safely? You're right, it wouldn't make sense for one player to micro that many drones. So it's probably more than one player. When you hear hoofbeats you think horse, not zebra. Basic scientific method.
---
With all the complaints about AFK mining, you'd think people would be on board with this.
---
I'm not saying it absolutely is not botting. I'm saying based on this, and the other replies about the ice drones, there's no evidence of botting. The best you could say is they didnt GTFO when you entered system, and given how prevalent battle rorqs are, they probably didn't care about one person.
---
Regardless, I hope you filed an actual petition about this. Posting about it on reddit 100% will do nothing to stop botting.
---
we wouldn't be aloud to undock without our daddy showing us the way lol
---
Why wouldn't they be? How does this sentence make any sense to you?
---
People get defensive when accused of something. In other news, fire hot, sky blue, cheeseburgers awesome.
---
Could always ask [CCP_Falcon](/u/CCP_Falcon) to do an ice mining demo on sisi to affirm your doubts? He's usually a good sport for r/eve
---
The page for Wormhole Campus for Eve University has some good info on what you need for going into J-space.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_Campus
---
And the farming of gotg keeps going, do they form fleets for anything else apart from defending tackled rorquals?
---
Stopped working for me too. Now using Evanova. 
---
The question I would ask as an addition is, why don't capitals have a +1/+2 per level bonus to warp core stab, in the same logic that an inty can tackle a capital ship ?
---
I just trained for these ships and came across just this, 641 paste to repair a gun 23% damaged. 
---
I can only assume how it came that far:
---
They removed off grid boosting, so you had to put rorqs in the belt.  Being stuck there and vulnerable they felt they should at least be able to do some mining if they had to sit in the belts.
---
From there they probably went over the amount of skillpoints and money to get into rorqs and were confident it balances itself out somehow.
---
Little did they know about skillinjectors being introduced around the same time. And how should they? /s
---
That's not how it works. It has to mine for 12 continuous seconds to get anything.
---
yes, deleted it a few months ago
---
[https://i.imgur.com/4MOEGmr.png](https://i.imgur.com/4MOEGmr.png)

but he has a reassureing voice that makes me feel safe
---
Assuming 1 unit of paste is 20k isk thats going to be 12.8mil lol
---
Obviously not, or else you are not skilled very far into it, or you would know that this is normal behavior.
---
CCP didnt care about their own lore from the start. Lore wise you need a binary system for gates to work. There are 0 binary systems in new Eden.
---
Why would you fit WCS to a Titan? 
---
So OP is just another SJW White Knight. Pro Tip, Goons are not that strong because of Bots. And Percentage Wise they have the same amount like every other entity. Must feel akward that Nobody gets triggered because of a cloaky camper:/ All your Ego wants get feeded is a single salty Local talk :/ Ut atleast Reddit feeds your Ego a little bit. &lt;3
---
Gonna be great to see the mouthbreathers on /r/eve upvote guy this anyways.

I fly the phantasm with max skills and can run any site except darks up to level 5. Also can rep up to 1098 ehp/second and do 750 dps. Makes it pretty safe in abyssal pvp.

PM me on discord for the fit/plants: Arabella Meyer#1955

I'm curious why OP made a fresh reddit account to [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ah9283/rorqual_excavator_botting_in_delve/) (automodded for freshness) and re-post this when he seems savvy enough to have an older reddit account.
---
three fiddy
---
Why would you question the FC?
---
look at his corp-history. he is hopping corps quite often for ''fresh air'' and content.
---
atleast thats what he said multiple times on stream
---
They used to be immune to all forms of ewar and tackle, meaning that you had to have heavy-interdictors to hold them in lowsec and in addition to that bubbles in nullsec. This is actually a nerf from how it used to be.
---
Usually in EVE it's the "niche role ships" that are the most important as they create the content for "mainline ships" ... 
---
This thread is amazing, you call out an alliance for something and when offered constructive arguments that you’re wrong you get all defensive and downvote everyone disagreeing with you.
---
Are you surprised that all these goon members are experts at the intricacies of rorq mining?
---
Do you have any idea how badly botting in rorqs would go with drone booshers, groups constantly ragerolling for delve wormholes, rats and delve roamers around?
---
Not only do you not know how excavs work, but you’re also completely ignorant about the botting menace.
---
Your "proof" of Goon Rorqual Botting is drones working as intended.
---
Damn the grr gons crowd is really scraping the bottom of the barrel lol
---
+1 querious is almost empty except init and goon sov
---
Yes, I've the same problem. Thought it was only me because my other char/accounts can log in perfectly
---
\^ This guy is correct. You ofc need 1 more point than the warp core amount to tackle. I stand corrected.
---
I checked the numbers and it was ok, not massively valuable, but my spreadsheet game is pretty bad. Depends how you consider you got the abyssal ressources from buy or sell orders.
---
Can confirm the exact same issue. Had some corpies which had also the problem
---
Ah, just tried to log in to another char and seems ok, origional char still black screens :(

me and my fleet members getting same problem :(..
---
Hi guys,   
---
I am brand new to Eve and have just finished the career missions and done a few more security type missions.   
---
I have a decent capital starting now and I am interested in trying out some trading to grow my wealth.   
---
Does anyone know of any decent guides on how to read the in-game market stuff and find items to trade in. I understand the basics of buy low sell high, but surely there can be a bit more to it than that?
---
I have the same problem while trying to pass through Niarja, but a character logged into J-space was able to log on and play just fine.
---
Eve Droid is dead apparently. I can't get it to work anymore. It might have to do with the recent removal of the old ESI URL.
---
Having said that, I've heard from reliable sources that an update of Evanova is in the work, which may introduce some support for various languages and a small number of fixes.
---
You are probably still a Brave member, then. Afaik we are very slow at purging inactives. You can check that easily - you can log in without subscription. You can't fly most ships as Alpha, but it's enough to check your stuff and reapply for Brave if necessary.
---
&gt; There is no way a player is micro managing 10-25 excavators at once in this manner! 
---
Don't underestimate the autism of the Goons
---
OP has done extensive rorqual ice mining but gas never learned that there is a trick to ice mining for max yield. Doesn't involve using any hot keys. Doesn't require any micromanagement. Doesn't require a script. Just look at the attributes of the drone, think a little, and do some math.
---
The behavior shown in these videos is exactly what happens when you are mining ice the right way.
---
Stop being poor?
---
I entered this system too, got stuck in infinite jump tunnel, relogged and stuck in black screen
---
This is happening to a number of Chars in Branch right now. The running theory is a node death. A GM was reported in our intel channel.
---
You should run for the next csm, you have a way with people. 
---
this is normal behavior for excav ice drones.

It was working about a month ago
---
A system in Branch is currently affected.

Are you saying there was a lunar eclipse somewhere in Domain?

May I suggest EVE Capsule as your replacement? It does all that EVE droid did only better, with fitting calculator soon(TM).
---
I can't believe it! /u/Clay_Hakaari just solved world poverty!
---
It’s been changed to give marketing instead of cpu upgrades V
---
I was not trolling - i was pointing out that you had one thought on your mind but wrote completely different one instead. If your argument is not \*cost\* but \*weight\*, then state so clearly.
---
Hey man those station workers have families too. How dare you sit on an ivory throne while some families have to work to repair goon ships for a living.
---
yeah no thats not what the post is about. thanks for your input though
---
If I mine for 3 seconds and then decide to make a sandwich and do 7 seconds mining 12 minutes later but then realise I forgot the pickle and then do the remaining 2 seconds mining 3 minutes later will I still get the delicious ice?
---
They just learned from Apple
---
You can try the bjorn bee's magu : https://zkillboard.com/kill/74596580/
---
Same. Sounding like a node died
---
Had it happen yesterday coming out of a station. Ultimately had to log off and back on to resolve it.
---
Caligoola
---
I jumped a gate about 3 minutes ago.
---
I'm still jumping that gate.
---
Saw it. Wonderful 
---
Im not saying its nothing to do with CCP but this 100% just sounds like a problem with your connection to the server.
---
So you in BLOPSECright?
---
I feel the same regarding the fuel but have no doubt in Mr Suitonia warping it back to Stain like he did the rattle.
---
Jumped an hour ago, still warping.
---
Since when that mechanic is a glitch? There was a video a few years ago and ccp defenetly know about that. Wh has a lot broken mechanics-for example, mvd bug, when u cant activate it because of mass, but if u do it in middle of jumping animation it will counts. About this type of farming - u need to be on anomaly for a hour of clicking d-scan and f1, its even more boring than vni afk ratting because u need to pay a lot of attention to sigs and d-scan and if someone will appear - that will mean u need to get back to your home system and roll this static or try to fight it. And btw it has pretty low isk/h because u need to farm sleepers relic or data sites which has low spawn rate(anomalies not worth to even touch)
---
"New" player making 500m daily passively...that's incredibly rare. I'm not saying it ain't possible but you need to understand why people are reacting the way they are. It's really not common and so most people will assume you are using a "new" character to infiltrate other corps in order to get content with their main toons. 
---
Not saying it's impossible at all, but it's really not common at all. Why do you want to join a wh group specifically?
---
Just theder up or use nanites
---
I just managed to login and escape the system
---
Eve android apps are all dead.
---
None are updated or maintained properly anymore.
---
Its gonna need more than that
---
Try it now, I just managed to login
---
Oh thanks, 
---
I guess i'll stick with dual nestor haha
---
I don't know if it's botting, but I find it sh** that there's nothing but Rorquals mining in these videos. I hope the nerfhamme comes soon for these excavators.
---
Sounds familiar.
---
Corp had a big fight going on and I'm burning to catch up. I jump into target system and screen goes pitch black. I can still see the overview and a Heretic off the in gate. I try to warp away but nothing happens, turns out a bubble was up. I jump back since it would be hard to get out with no graphics. AS I jump back I am stuck in an infinite warp tunnel with no working overview, local, nothing. I try to warp out but nothing happens. After a while I start taking damage and the damage message tells me it is the Heretic, which I can't see. So by right clicking in space I access the right warp gate, jump in to target system, which finally loads properly and warp off.
---
In the mean while corp is getting properly cap dropped and swarm with tackle. So thanks CCP for saving my ship from almost certain death.
---
Mainly because I ran into a couple different small fleets / gankers. I know that it’s all just part of the game but I was hoping for more 1v1 and ended up getting baited a couple times by t1 then faction frigs came in. 
---
In short, yes. HUGE ISK differential.  Ob both a per site, and per tick basis.  In hisec, you'd generally make something like 1-3m per site?  In lowsec I think it was something like 5m per site?  But in Nullsec, depending on the specific type of anomaly you'd make 20-30m per site.  
---
A VNI in Null with good, but not necessarily perfect skills, should be looking at 18-20m ticks.
---
I am afraid of this, still looking for something that i can manage somehow.
---
great another PVEer that wants to PVP but pls no losses...this is good for the game right?
---
Yeah sorry dude, the goonies know their mining and their explanations sound pretty on-point. You can say it looks different to what you've seen elsewhere, but the cycle time mechanics are inarguable. 
---
Supers and titans used to be immune to all tackle except hic points and bubbles. It meant that supers and titans were extremely difficult to tackle, especially if you were in a garbage fleet. People complained alot about it and so CCP saw fit to nerf them so now a blob of rifters is actually threatening to a solo super/titan.
---
Title: excited
---
Content: disappoint
---
I was home in Ireland for Christmas and played, second year in a row, no issues. 
---
Or maybe its because its new tech and parts are expensive 
---
Even though I have a massive rage boner for goons and was really hoping this would be some juicy proof of botting OP left me disappointed, this looks pretty normal, I'd like to be proven wrong though, in fact I want to be but it doesn't look like anything our of the ordinary...
---
i wasnt in eve for some times, and i am gonna fix my pc so i can play it again, is it worth after ccp were bought? 
---
For c3 cap stable praxis with shield tank and rapid heavy missles is op, 900 dps tanking and about 1000-1200 dps for just 400-600kk. Drone damage type ships like dominix, myrmydon or gila/rattle will be very uneffective because npc will immideatly agro to your drons and u will loose a lot of dps for just rescooping drones. And rattlesnake will cost you a lot more money to get praxises values so it not worth for c3 at all. Ç3 is dangerous because a lot of people farm it and u can loose your ship with very big chances.
---
My advice - pve  - shield , missles, drones to 4 lvl
---
Scan- go to 3 thats enough for begining or u can go to 4 but without t2 scanner or t3 cruiser its not worth it.
---
Mining - venture and barges to 4 + gas harvesting to 3 or 4
---
Pvp - u should ask corp about that because i was in a lot of corps and they all had different doctrines, so there are a few universal skills - termodynamic to 4, armor and shield tanking skills to 4, support skills(those who affect all sizes of weapons) of missiles, turrets and drones to 4
---
And yet they can just bump them forever...
---
I mean I was interested in the post, saw what OP was talking about, checked the video and downvoted him/this topic. Though it has proven hilarious to watch the replies :D 
---
Can you guess who also didn’t broadcast?
---
second photo looks like new asteroid depletion
---
OMFG ! This is fkin hilarious ! Gj mate !!!! &lt;3
---
Christ no don't use nanites, overheat damage on trig guns uses thousands. 
---
It's possible, but the fits I've found are....scary to run them in
---
Not on the character selection but always on the first undock.
---
No one in eve cant send coordinates and bookmarks. 
---
No one mapped systems territory for cubes. 
---
I have a feeling that someone gave ships techs to all people in eve and didnt sayed what to do with it. 
---

---
Easy - the race and “faction” you choose does not affect gameplay aside for starting location and ships. As for player created entities - they are corporations and alliances, not factions. 
---
There is a gameplay element called Faction Warfare, but your starting race does not affect it too whatsoever. 
---
Hm never flown triglavian good to know tho
---
&gt;Black rise dead
---
How could this have happened?
---
and what do you want these “goon members” to do? agree with your hypocrizy and stupidity just because you want them to? get some brain and stop being hypocrite
---
Armor tank and damage mods on a frigate don't really mix.
---
Those are both pretty standard fits.  Maybe you're retarded?
---
Don't be.  It's probably Olmeca.  
---
You shouldn't be afraid of losing cheap t1 frigs.  Stick to fw space if you want fights.  Most people won't bother blubbing a t1 frig but there are some groups that are cancer and worth avoiding.
---
Black rise. You blob some, you get blobbed some. Can’t really fly anything BC up consistently though because Snuff will hotdrop you with Rorquals. 
---
Agreed.  Fighter mechanics - specifically the UI, even more specifically the "selected thing/s" UI is fucking TERRIBLE.  I would say CCP fix it but CCP can't fix it.  The best they can do is completely scrap it and start over.
---
I almost extracted my Nyx pilot and sold my Nyx last week.  The only reason I didn't is because I looked at my ship in station (note: can't spin it) and felt sad.  It was a brand new build and my first Super.  I don't want to get rid of it.
---
I try not to activate them in the same tick just to be sure. I almost always sequentially activate the Siren then Dromi, though I do fuck it up from time to time.
---
OP, how does it feel like to have less brains than spodbrains?
---
looks like problem solved
---
This is Def a blast from the past!!
---
They should get Hans Zimmer to do the rest of the tracks +
---
I'll have a look, I only really want tit for skillqueue monitoring.
---
nah, I think blopsec were pure mar5hy alts and apparently he's banned since a few days now. and tbh mar5hy would not write the way this dude does.
---
Lol dictors are throwaway.  Warp in dump bubbles and die.  How far can you get your head further up your own ass? 
---
I think someone’s fallen on their head...
---
The Chinese sent a bot recently...
---
It's probably going to be a while before I can really give it a go. I got an Astroview 90MM for Christmas and the EQ2 mount seemed like it was barely up to taking the weight of my phone.
---
That said, I'm new to having a telescope, so I'm happy to have been able to snap anything. :)
---
Do you have any suggestions for the brand of T-mounts and maybe a more sturdy EQ mount?
---
Yes 
---
Other ice excavators possibly with a drone nav as opposed to a omni fit. I dunno 
---
Why would you ping him for this?  We're doing just fine here and Falcon has better shit to do, like literally anything but this.
---
I love this.
---
You fail to understand game mechanics and blame it on bots rather than trying to learn. If I dont know how it works and I cant explain or bother to learn IT MUST BE A BOT!
---
Tried to, 60% damage on T2 med guns was 2500 nanite to repair
---
Fake news. INIT doesn't evict their own pets.
---
It is. Dropped an Athanor on it and I'm just waiting for the mining laser to cut some shit up.
---
If it was mainly minerals...
---
Dude, you've been told by a dozen people and the evidence to confirm is right in front of you.
---
Are you an anti-vaxxer that's going to fall off the edge of the Earth too?
---
You're wrong.  Suck it up, look at the evidence and do some critical thinking.  And please, please take this as a lesson outside of this particular incident.  If you have this much trouble seeing you're wrong when it's this clear-cut, how is anyone ever going to convince you that vaccines work (or anything else similar).
---
It's okay to be wrong sometimes.  
---
This thread is a textbook example of the concept of doubling down, and why you should generally not do it when having an internet slapfight.
---
keep pressing F1 ...
---
This is a pretty embarrassing post.
---
Like a Sabre pilot?  The ship so expendable people have alts dedicated to dying in them?  Okay. 
---
If you want to be safer fit some Warp Core Stabalizer. I use an Anathema with 3  Halcyon War Core Stabs.
---
12 minutes? You must not have a minifridge at your desk to minimize time spent feeding yourself. What a casual! Think of all the dank ice yields you could be getting in that time!
---
English coms? 
---
I always assumed that both corp were finnish as Arctic light description is in finnish) 
---
(on the other side Succo CEO has quite a finnish name too https://evewho.com/pilot/Ukko+Pohjolainen)
---
"btw here is sound of waves, enjoy your day in Iceland answering tickets"
---
yeah 98837% seems wrong
---
this this drawn by ur acoustic son
---
Your comments show that you don't realize the amount of work, time and dedication any application of that size requires.
---
Indeed, it's going to need more than the help you're providing.
---
What if the bot's became self aware and now are calling out the bots that like humans.
---
I like how OP is just evidence of why Mittens doesn't want brokebrain line members reporting blues.
---
Nice; that's 50.1 million ISK
---
No 
---
._.
---
This is almost like Goon propaganda to discredit people with accurate botting/broadcasting claims lol
---
Must have been the electric son then.
---
I went to catch a couple of times recently and we had good fun. Thats until someone has to bring a haw dread and kill the fight basically...
---
Stop
---
Confirming EVE Panda seems pretty good.
---
It must suck to put this much effort into a thread/botting claim for it only to be your own misunderstanding :(
---
Multiboxing is not botting.
---
/u/LaskerEmanuel used to do a lot of solo Magnate stuff, and whilst it's almost invariably an uphill battle it can catch people off guard and he has a very respectable win ratio with it. As one of the comments below said, filtering out relic/data analysers on the fit would probably provide a significant reduction in false fits, and focus on the PVP uses of it.
---
I'd argue the heron is probably the only truly viable one due to its large amount of mids for a frigate to give good control, but it'd be good to see a write up on them.
---
Are there any plans to move up the ship size tree? I'm sure others would love to see how destroyers fit into the meta (particularly as there's now a bit more choice with command destroyers and the kikmora for example).
---
this meme is not funny and I hope you get banned for this post
---
it's not a joke its an outcry against bots
---
Yeah, let's establish a precedent where people get banned based on bullshit rumors, with no investigation or verification on CCPs part.
---
That'll do wonders for the game population.
---
 You can multibox as many rorquals as your pc handles because they're afk munching on rocks blame the game design not the player choosing the less effort path
---
Can you prove there aren't any? 
---
&gt;!Thought so, silly wormholer doesn't know the power of local!&lt;
---
 I like the girth of the bee it fits modern times but it needs some excavators orbiting it 
---
Je suis gigx
---
 I've had no fun in this game for past 4 years
---
OP sucks at booshing drones. 
---
There are no "Pith" A-type Adaptive Invulns types however, which are what would drop in 9/10s
---
XD 
---
hm looks much worse on desktop 
---
 Do you love gold?Do you want to feel superior? Do you like lasers? Would you like a limitless supply of ammo that takes almost no cargo space? Do you hate freedom and rust? If you answered yes to atleast one question sign in with the Amarrians 
---
 The Agency!
---
Ice Excavators have a very short cycle time. Tbh these vids look like regular mining to me. No timings are out of the ordinary...
---
Can it be day 1 of you bathing regularly instead?
---
 Goons are the top force in EVE right now but they are focusing on turtling up
---
i showered for 4 hours yesterday
---
Why do you think people have so many Dictor Alts ?
---
I think it is not because they are unimportant and disposable ... logic ... it is not strong with you ...
---
Up untill Christmass null  anom ratting was superior but now due to glamorox75 both high sec level 4 burner missions and low sec level 5's far supass it.
---
Your equatorial mount should have come with counterweights to mitigate the weight of various eyepieces (some of which can get downright outrageous) .  As for T-mounts, I use the orion t-mount.
---
Eve online has devolved into shitposting on reddit while botting rorquals
---
Change my mind
---
I don't have discord handy, but if you could post the fit here or pm me here, that would be greatly appreciated!
---
nice flairbait
---
Never had an issue during my business travel. My IP could jump from my hometown to Ukraine and then to US in weeks and I had no issues with CCP
---
but input broadcasting the excavators of 20 Rorqs in the same server tick is ....
---
#metoo .... 
---
I want tit for resting my tired face on....
---
ayo fam hit me up fam
---
got a nice once just freed up 1 previous tenant all cleaned up like new 
---
only thing is there hay be a few left over 3200s laying around the grounds
---
Fits are fine, you'll just need to get used to them - like never get caught in that Tristan, what these ship can fight and what they can't fight, etc. Lose 50 frigs and you'll know a lot more. ;)
---
Looking at your losses - avoid faction/pirate frigates for now, until you get a feeling for what they can and cannot do. Comets, Worms, Garmurs in particular are pretty much a no-go against t1 frigs.
---
Check local, if there's a lot of players, use something like https://adashboard.info/intel to figure out if there's a gang in the same system, then you need to be a lot more careful.
---
Getting fights is a lot harder that it used to be - use dotlan to figure out where people are, but FW lowsec is pretty dead, unfortunately.
---
After a fight, if you lose - try and figure out what went wrong, and what you can do to fix that. "I warped into a novice complex with my kiting tristan and got scrammed immediately" -&gt; Don't warp a kiter into a plex on top of a brawler. "I burned out my guns" -&gt; pay more attention to heat, etc. 
---
You'll lose a lot in the beginning, though, that's normal.
---
or when you (accidentaly) kissed a boy https://media1.tenor.com/images/734dbc32bbf71de3a3083a82f161d306/tenor.gif

Posting in a legendary thread
---
Nice to see you are having fun! its exactly a year for me too.
---
can only agree to everything you said...it was the best eve decision i ever made. quite a ride but id recommend it to everyone.
---
Heretic also serves a niche as combat probing dictor - try fitting combat probes + cloak + interdiction launcher on any other dictor and you'll see the issue (Flycatcher comes close, but having much less lowslots means you won't be able to fit enough co-processors for everything you need to be online). This doesn't get it on many kills, but it's still a clear niche.
---
Apt flair
---
&gt; You can multibox as many rorquals as your pc handles
---
True
---
&gt; You can recall all excavators from all the Rorqs your PC can handle in the same server tick 
---
False
---
I know a bit about this as I manage a 100 planet PI empire in null.
---
Resources on planets replenish slowly over time. There is a difference in the rate based on the security status of the system and the concentration of base resource on the individual planets.
---
So a lava planet in high-sec will have a felsic magma concentration of around 5-25%, where as a lava planet in null or wormhole space will have concentration up to 100%. These planets will replenish resources much faster.  I would love to have the exact formula for this rate but that is CCP-op sec.
---
4's
---
The devs persecute people posting names and identities of bots, you know, merely taking a screenshot of local and Dscan with a page full of botting VNIs whose behaviour would be completely trivial to identify, gets you sanctioned by CCP.
---
The correct answer is to ban them, then let them submit claims to innocence. If their claims are frivolous or easily disproven, banning was clearly the correct decision and the number of bots claiming innocence would be small indeed, especially with the devblog threatening alliance leadership with penalties for harbouring bots.
---
Rich get richer mechanics?
---
Evenova is great, just wish it had the "skill required for" details. Until then I will still keep using droid even though it's dead
---
?
---
I think wormhole space has something most MMOs are missing and it's being important and needed in the grand scheme of things.
---
&gt; The correct answer is to ban them, then let them submit claims to innocence. 
---
In civilized society, we don't prove innocence. "Prove to me that you're NOT doing something bad" isn't what we do. You're looking for the Middle Ages.
---
gender swapping, you so up to date &lt;3
---
je suis stunt
---
they are the bots
---
- memes
---
- surprise factor. Many people don't know what an Eris is, and even if they know, bubble fit is so bad they will ignore it and meanwhile the bubble-less meme fit can apply dps.
---
It's literally a whole different experience, wormholes are love, wormholes are life.
---
It's ok to be wrong when you click the Report Bot button in game as long as it's in good faith. But to keep it in good faith IMO we should be careful with reddit accusations that could lead to brigade reporting and CCP wasting their time with false positives.
---
I assume CCP has some control where they don't look at individual ingame reports or at least filter them in some way first.
---
Unfortunately it seems dead and hasn't been update with new ships.
---
Is there a way in evanova to add more than 1 item at once to a shop if they are the same type e.g. more than 1 turret? Fitting each turret manually etc is tedious. The recent tab doesn't work when making fits either
---
I went out side to go look at it. All I saw was snow though, then I froze to death in the -40c windchills and no one found my corpse as it was promptly buried under 30cm of snow.
---
I am a ghost
---
good thing eve online isnt a civilized society its a video game 
---
looks good
---
Was before I started playing or could fly t2 ships... I'd love to see ahac fleets instead of nano/mjd fleets engaging at 100-200km. I guess closest thing nowadays is wormhole gangs/ small hot drops, but those won't use Zealots, more t3c's/ triglovian/ stratioses.
---
Lol
---
L2 use paragraphs
---
EVE have serious boting issue and annoyed players address this in worst way possible - by shitposting about every activity as a bot one ...  on reddit.         
---
Change my mind. 
---
Hey Cortana. Remind me about planetary in 96 hours
---
and this is how it starts...games become reality...
---
Another post for this? Now we just fishing for updoots
---
While I can't say anything about low sec, in my Nidhogguer, meh skills doing about 2200 dps, I can make 500mil from ratting in about 5 hours. Thats qith no extra spawns or escalations, just straight ratting with a few min breaks. Those arnt amazing numbers, and multiple people are making more, but I'm able to plex with isk, so if feels good enough.
---
Haha alright man, glad I made an impression and that you felt like voicing your own opinion (especially to me), or lack thereof, about the current T3C situation.
---
What
---
LOL, so much effort, so little payoff. 
---
This is an example of an OP who hit rock bottom and kept digging. 
---
Day 1 of Elo trying to be sober and actually log into eve... plz discuss
---
Small blaster... you need to bump the target. Actually it gets optimal rage bonus so maybe 2km optimal with void.
---
It honestly depends on what you want out of the game. Since you are bew things can definitely seem pretty overwhelming! I would check out dreddit tbh. We have an amazing mentot program where we hook you up with a more experienced player to guide you through this game. They are nullsec but dont let that scare you off.. its often safer than highsec.
---
Should include a link to that with your next srp request lol
---
thank you for your support
---
ty! &lt;3
---
Eve capsule doesn't even have evemail... that's pretty basic. 
---
Agree with most except paragon soul. A slong as you stay away from g-mag(border of period basis) their are a lot of test renters/pets down there that will often come out in random shit to fight
---
This is more like an alt on a shitty spinoff 
---
u hav gay
---
average redditor getting trolled by elo and judy
---
Lol true
---
In which Querns shows up to defend botters by posting some assmad nonsense, like usual.
---
The community is second to none
---
With the number of selfie he send us from the shower Elo is probably the cleanest eve player
---
7 fights in 3 hours is about right. 
---
Flex :P 
---
But that must be a nightmare to maintain so much management 
---
I can tell that he is a fine gentleman with refined taste for the arts! What’s not to like on this picture? It’s perfect!
---
I've never really gotten a crisp answer on this, but perhaps you may know: is there any competition for P0 between characters, or does each character have its own little instanced PI sandbox? If the former, what's the degree of competition?
---
C2 NS/C5 is probably the easiest way to get PvP content. You still face supers umbrellas and blob response fleet but you can get kills, catch big targets are just roam solo-ish and a daily basis. You get good isk making if you bother running the static C5 and somewhat decent HS connection. The main issue is logistics if you don't have any DST/BR character and you are used to JF services, it's a pain. But other than that, it's pretty chill PvP. No boring structure bash (unless you consider rorqual to be structure bash, which is pretty close), not a whole lot of strat ops.
---
Devolved? Mining is such a shit activity that I'd call a mining bot to allow shitposting Evolution.
---
&gt;You're looking for the Middle Ages.
---
Which are intended to resemble Eve Online a great deal more than the post-industrial stage, but whatevs...
---
Was this drawn by your friend or your todler, cause they are fucking awful.
---
Dam set the bots up at downtime, hope they are o.k. I get nervous submitting tickets on those accounts.
---
You are better off mining the most isk/m3 ore, selling it, and buying the minerals you need. Especially if you don't have your refining skills trained up. 
---
[Fuzzworks shows isk/m3 for each base ore. Do the 5/10% more ores for more isk.](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/)
---
He hasnt run out of cocaine yet
---
It can sunbelt be bleak and barren. I thought it was so beautiful, like being on another planet entirely
---
7 in 3 hours is not that bad. I can't remember the last time I had a fight in a belt, everything in a belt is some kind of bait or a noob.
---
In FW space, keep tab of who blobs. There's a number of notorious dual boxers (Rusty Ford for example usually has a cloaked griffin alt that will perma jam you) and there's some folks that are obviously rolling around with 2B clones with full HG snakes and they'll go kite you at like 4500+ m/s before heat.
---
One good way to get fights in a kitey T1 frigs is to tray and separate a gang on a plex, if you can stretch them out over 300-400 km, you can often kill the faster one and since on/in a plex the others cannot warp directly to you, they either have to bounce off a ping (outside) or are stuck slow boating (inside).
---
CCP are a grown ass company that don't need their owner to fuck up their game, don't worry.
---
Iskperhour gets used quite a bit. I also know there is an option to see how much compressed ore is used to build something. https://eveiph.github.io/
---
Its on github, so source code is viewable.
---
I always figured those spaces were for whites only. I mean the picture of the family is white. WTF does it actually mean then?
---
Oof
---
My filters we're set to jumps, sitting on station. My mistake was right clicking from the skills window because, easy! 16 jumps to collect them all later, lesson learned.
---
Jspace best space. CEFIN is recruiting.
---
Um, Suitonia's in Horde?
---
Sitting in station, market sorted by jumps you would figure right clicking the skill in your skill window would select buy this type closer than 7 jumps away when the dozen books are available at almost every system within those 7 jumps. Nope.
---
TL;DR
---
OP is a dumb cunt.
---
&gt; Does anyone know of any decent guides on how to read the in-game market stuff and find items to trade in. I understand the basics of buy low sell high, but surely there can be a bit more to it than that ?

Not really, at least if you just want to sit in a trade hub. You can try and anticipate patch changes and speculate on those, but it's quite risky and potentially not worth it. You can see a market, eg import the good from Jita into a trade hub (be it in HS or in an NS alliance), there is for sure isk to make but will mean you would have to haul yourself or pay JF services.
---
Keep in mind that unless you *really* enjoy number crushing, most people take trading as an isk making activity. You just make isk to pay for PvP ships for example. If you only do that in Eve you might be bore really fast.
---
Don't forget to mention the lack of mandatory local chat! It really provides a kind of realism unmatched in k-space.
---
We didn't have a super moon at all, ateast not from my perspective. Shit was tiny. 
---
Flight time is basically a non-issue on Gneiss and Arkonor. Yes, you will lose a bit on those too, but it's negligible.   
---
However, On the roids that make for the most volume of a belt (i.e. Spod/Ochre), it has a huge effect. Drones travel out to 15k tops (on large spod) and that makes for up to 50% loss per drone for some cycles. I think it averages out to a 15% loss on Spod and the Ochre in the enormous belts.   
---
In any way: Don't be an idiot and take the rorqual numbers for granted or to argue with. They are just wrong and you would show everyone that you never mined in a rorq before and that you don't know what you are talking about. 
---
You didn't know the PLA was using Serenity as a strategy tester?
---
OP is really smart.  There is no way CCP has being paying attention to a region that consistently tops the charts in the MER.  There is no way they would be interested in how its done and why Delve so wildly out produces every other region.  With the OP's insightful thread CCP shall surely have their eyes opened and get right on that, just after they solve how to keep Caracals off the open market and make that gate to Stain.
---
Ahh that sucks.
---
Because there was no evidence at all that lead to that lmao.
---
Meh

"CCP please do something"

biggest joke there

It was kinda intermittently/half working at that time for me. It was already having long load times to start up or do much of anything, crashing in the fitting tool, etc. It's gotten worse, it seems. I actually deleted it off my phone after using (and pretty regularly donating for) it for a few years now.
---
Society ceases to be civilized when it's invaded by cancer and the government must resort to some form of martial law to maintain order.
---
The botters are abusing the fact that CCP doesn't have enough manpower to carry out investigations of thousands of bots.
---
Goons are for life, not just from Christmas
---
Yes, Roller Mobster.
---
When does anyone from BL post for anything other than a shallow upvote. I would rather wake up to a TEST paint propaganda than this low effort shit.
---
They still have the same issue with Posi track
---
And when we have blamed the game design, we sit around and do fuck all until it never changes?
---
If someone is "caught" for botting, that should be a ban.
---
Suitonia has a vid up somewhere on missile mechanics. It doesn't matter on everything, but for rocket Garmur it REALLY matters. Otherwise you may very well be dealing something like 70% dps or worse at 70% your rocket optional
---
So before the hate starts rolling in, let me say this;
---
I've never owned a rorq, so it's not like I have actually done this. But IIRC, according to the rules, macros are OK as long as 1 input = 1 player input. You could make a macro that goes
---
    Shift+R
---
    Alt+Tab
---
Etc for the number of rorq accounts you have    
---
Then you bind the macro to the mousewheel, and spam scrollwheel. I truly believe you can input all those commands within a single server tick if you scroll fast enough.
---
But please check if this is allowed before doing so, don't get banned for being stupid y'all
---
This has to be the most un emotional response ever!!! 
---
Elo if you're actually Elo because you guys circle jerk about tricking people about stuff no one is really in a position to confirm.
---
Keep posting like this and you will win best wet blanket post of 2019.

They banned gigx that means they must ban every other person this sub gets a hardon about,  and they must unban gigx because other people have been unbanned.

This is the level of subtly and nuance delivered to you by noted news source reddit dot com

I regret giving that dude my money. He made an update for the ESI conversion and wrote out a bunch of future plans, then added ads to cash in on donations. He's not updated since then.

For me, the super moon was early in the night. I started looking about 6PM and the moon was huge. By the time the eclipse was in full swing (abt midnight for me), the moon was much farther away and smaller (but red).

 Your fuckin' family's dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Three-decker men at best. You, however, grew up on the North Shore, huh? Well, la-di-fuckin'-da. You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? Huh? One kid with your old man, one kid with your mother. You're upper-middle class during the weeks, then you're droppin' your "R"s and you're hangin' in the big, bad Southie projects with your daddy, the fuckin' donkey on the weekends. I got that right? 
---
I would recommend EVE University as an impartial and neutral learning point. 
---
The problem with all the other newbie outfits is they slowly but surely dripfeed you their own personal koolaid, and before you know it, you're a 1 year old player in the game who is mad about bad things an enemy alliance did to your alliance 2/5/7 years ago, etc.
---
The best part is, the above statement is blanket applicable for every faction; they've all bloodied eachother quite significantly over the course of EVE history.
---
&gt;  As for T-mounts, I use the orion t-mount

I think I'm going to check that out. I appreciate the help.
---
Input broadcasting is not botting too, it's call "using Isboxer". Ah ! Jokes on you
---
It's too bad he didn't kill you for real.
---
Well, the retards have been pushing the "join a corp"-narrative for years, which has resulted in what you see.
---
Your videos don't help your case; you show one maybe two rorquals at a time, none with similar names and show nothing out of the ordinary from regular ice mining.
---
Most people won't bother... except people starved for content like the Goons. They feed a Moa with Cyno to a gang of T1 and 1or2 faction Frigates and drop T3C on them. xD
---
can confirm. we had a fantastic weekend, and we've had great fights pretty constantly these past few months
---
come to wormholes, the worst that could happen is playing the best version of eve 
---
I'm not sure JFing is even that much easier really. Sure if you want to move a fuck load of stuff it's nice, but personally I find it way more chill to just be able to fly like 10-15 jumps to Jita with a DST or just pod myself there and buy a couple new ships. No bugging people for "JF trip /when/" and twiddling your thumbs for 2 days.
---
Fuck it, if it behaves like a bot and is botlike then it deservers and ought to be banned like one bot or not. No loss there since there is no actual play distinction and just as harmful to the game as actual bots. Good riddance fuck botlike multiboxers and all their supporters.
---
It's almost like TEST doesn't pride itself on being elite PVP.
---
No, he's probably that new scrub running alts in Balance of Scales or another Olmecca wannabe.
---
There are people in Delve with 20+ rorqs. You can't alt-tab through 20 accounts, even if you bind light cyno/recall drones to mouse-wheel in a second.
---
I can't thank you enough for taking the time to type that out for me. I think ill make a cheat sheet out of this to help with target priorities. If I'm running missiles, are the "Ghosting/Confuser" spawns still high priority? 
---
I'll link my killboard below. The most recent loss is my blinged version of a gila. Looking over your suggested numbers, it doesn't meet hold up. Mostly in the tank department. But the strategy was to get dps offgrid quick while kiting. Im doing that now with that same fit except everything is T2, minus the propmod with is a dead space MWD. Let me know what you think.

Hey, north boi, try to sort your own shit like this well known botter : https://zkillboard.com/character/2114121644/ Protect by Riot Rick himself before trying to find bot within goons by looking how the excavator drone move around a rock, or just play this fucking game and let the banning crew do their fucking job, right now you are like a guy who believe earth is flat in 2019, pathetic

I would really recommend LS faction warfare. At times, I can't even get up to pee because I have to guard my little t1 frigate farmer. :(
---

---
X for you shut the fuck up 
---
A second is longer than you think. Now use a mouse with unlocked (infinite) scrollwheel to reduce the reistance, and I'm almost certain you can do more than 20 inputs in a second.
---
Repair costs vary with standings to NPC station owner...maybe?
---
I noticed that only Goons and Test are virtuous enough to be free of bots. :bigthink:

I'd give faction warfare another chance. Sometimes you will find someone (like me) waiting in a complex for a 1v1

Now I will preface this by saying I have no idea why this works or if it still works, but in both null and WHs if I found that my drones were being targeted a lot eject from your ship and get back in (not in combat obvs) then try it again.

For whatever reason this seemed to cause my drones to almost never be targeted.

Glad youre having fun dude! I made the decision to start solo roaming in whs few months ago. Its a whole new experience for me :d

Over 2600 solar systems to explore, each system has a story of its own. When i see a pos stick i think about the previous owners and the history they had there. Some dead poses i found date back to 7 years ago. Roleplay reasons i put up my mobile depot next to it and use it as a tent haha. I feel like a archeologist too sometimes.

Everyday theres something to do, new things to learn and new mysteries waiting to be discovered! You may find a system that hasnt been inhabited for years... or you may find a system where a group has lost everything they had, their hopes and dreams crushed.

---
Man, this thread got assblasted. 
---
just tether on some freeport and wait a minute 
---
svipuls are still pretty fun to gatecamp with
---
Sorry, what bug are you referring to?
---
If you mean to ask why they are shooting at different targets when you have 'Focus Fire' ticked, then that's because Focus Fire only ensures your drones all try to fire at the same time, it does not mean that they all focus the same target when left on their own.
---
Yes, Ghosting/Confuser rats apply both turret disruption and missile disruption, diminishing your range as well as application. Rapid Lights don't suffer anywhere near as bad as HAMs, but the disruption is still somewhat bothersome. 
---
You mean that you are doing 4s again? 
---
TBH I have less experience with kiting fits, since I find AB fits more reliable and relaxing to run. But they work, with good target prioritization. In general, learning how to react to the various spawns will make them much easier to handle, and will cut your completion time drastically.
---
If they learned from apple you would have to go into the Abyss to fix it and the Triglavians would wage ware on any soul who tried to make repair schematics.
---
Your toon's "faction" in the olden days affected starting skills and starting attributes. Nowadays, it affects which race of the frigate skill you start with and like a racial gun skill. You cross train to the same level of any other race's turrets and frigates in like a day. The remaining "racial" weapon systems (missiles and drones) are now fairly evenly distributed between all the races, sure gallente have more drone boats, but the amarr are right behind them.

That's not 20 inputs. It's 40. Ctrl+tab to shift window, then light cyno. I can guarantee you that can't be done in a single server tick without input broadcasting.

I am up to about 75 worlds myself. The security rating impacts the overall concentration on a planet, which (I cannot substantiate except through 3 years of doing hardcore PI) makes it feel like a much faster regeneration rate. Also, I used to put down all of my extractors in the same spot and they hit the lower draw amount faster. I now spread the extractors to different hot spots on the world and I get more product pulled per cycle (4 days) so that had an impact.

If you're looking to join faction warfare, dirt n glitter has just rejoined amarr fw for the 5th time. Great place for a new bro to learn the ropes of small gang and solo warfare vs just being a number in a blob in null sec. Check us out in game, hop in our public channel 'dirtnglitter' in game and say hello. 
---
Yeah but that's the thing, if you don't have a DST you have to go with bringing your ships one by one which is a pain, especially when first joining. And if you're new to solo / nano / taking care of your own shit, you might loose a ship or two a day and it can be a pain to bring them all through 15+ jumps HS connection you might not have during your prime time. Most of the large alliances have daily JF run bringing you ships and it's by far a lot more convenient.
---
Jackdaws are also fighter-killers
---
👏
---
Nobody cares howthefuck you call it, it is against EULA and should be banned ...
---
Whoever decided to make all the neocom buttons monochrome needs to be shot. The thing is you know it's a UI designer that thinks they made something really beautiful and aesthetic looking, but doesn't realise people can't actually tell the fking buttons apart easily. When I came back after a long break could barely tell which was which for a while, god knows what it's like for people that just started playing.   
---
The worst part of the UI is module controls (even with hotkeys) though. Basically after switching off your guns / a module or your target being destroyed it takes a completely random amount of time between instant and several seconds before you can put them on another target. I understand this is the client waiting for the server to tell you your guns are actually off, but other games / mmos manage to have smooth feeling hotkeys / cooldowns without any trouble. Using them is horrible.
---
I didn't say they were unimportant but they're fucking disposable.  You must not get any large fleet action, your inexperience and ignorance is shining brilliantly. 
---
I've tried mobile, isn't really helping...
---
Very cool work dude! Keep it up! Can’t imagine the time you out into this, highly impressive!

You buy another titan instead so you have a shield titan and an armour titan 
---
Yep, it has those stupid rendered video clips of ships flying around etc that play for 1-3 seconds anytime you click on something. Someone on the UI team thinks it looks pretty, but actually it's just massive visual noise that confuses the eye.
---
And you are for sure a spoonfed F1 Drone that never creates content but just leeches, as you do not want to fly/do "unimportant stuff" ...
---
In a smaller gang a svipul or jackdaw can be used as heavier tackle, anti support as you said and of course for combat probing. Svipuls can run with either ac or Arty depending on how you're going about things, though of course with ac fit you're less likely to live if things go tits up and you have to bounce. 
---
As fleet sizes go up in number the jackdaw and confessor see the most use, jackdaws being a fairly common doctrine for larger alliance's due to their missile range.
---
All four can do solo against almost any hull destroyer down and even fair well against some cruisers.
---
They get used literally all the time. They have a &lt;2 second align time and can fit MWD, Scram, and dual web while simultaneously putting out ~600 DPS. Their speed / warp speed isn't quite up to par with interceptors but their damage and tackle make them the perfect VNI killers.
---
Dual web = dead 100mn VNI real quick.
---
Rail Hecates are also fun, although not as popular as blaster Hecates by any means.
---
(ingame)
---
that was only because ccp are afraid of anime
---
I used to solo belt rat in an SB in syndicate / outer ring to repair sec status while making not too shitty ISK. If I got in a good groove, I'd kill 6-8 spawns per hour making about 1520m ISKs which isn't all that great but since it's 1 spawn per system there's a lot of time spent travelling and you do get 6-8 sec updates per hour.
---
When I lived in OR full time I'd do serpentis sites in an Ishtar with a Tornado alt, isk/h was decent and the escalations were usually not too far and in completely quiet dead-end systems.
---
Alright spodbrain back to your belt. 
---
word of advice on that kestrel fit, in lowsec you'll be fighting afterburner frigates, which means rage rockets will not apply very well with only 1 web. You can try to armor tank it and use the spare mid for another web or drop the scram for the 2nd web.
---
If you want to kill ratters and shit doctor pilots in Vale, Tenal, Branch all you need is 3 or 4 guys in Asteros.
---
They'll still try and blob you but the gangs are pretty easy to avoid.
---
Honestly I think nullsec should overall be more like jspace (especially anom respawns and local).
---
Is this true ?
---
they did form some caps / ishtars and ferox and apparently gotg was forming but didn't make it in time
---
Everyone that tries to argument that it is possible to give the same command to 20+ Accounts within the same server tick is either:

Oh look I’m desperate to stay edgy and not perpetually appear AFK.

The least you could do is line up the sleeves.

Not that it would improve your post by much.

---
I trust that you guys are clever enough to understand what to look at in the video. The framerate of the recording and in vegas is 60 FPS, hence the 60 frames I use. Here, I proove that you can easiely do 500+ actions within a second using infintie scrollwheel.
---
Wait so you could gain DPS by not having focus fire checked ?
---
Jackdaws are awesome. Long range food tank great speed and agility
---
Hecate's are neiche imo. Great DPS lower tank.
---
Confessors is the mid range for me. Good tank average range but slow.
---
Svipul sits between the confessor and Jack for my usages. Faster than a fessor with a tad more range but slower than jackdaws with less range.
---
They all can be fit for specific uses but imo the jackdaw is the best for fleet usage due to the speed and range. (And instant reps on a small ehp pool)
---
Confessors are good for smaller gang stuff especially in wolf ryats but even then..... Jackdaws can just shoot soooo far with a great volley for their size 
---
The tech of yesterday, at the prices of tomorrow.

&gt; while botting rorquals
---
But ... But ... https://imgflip.com/i/2rofoe
---
And now try doing this while alt+tabbing through eve clients and the clients actually accepting the commands.
---
Read my edit in the original comment (https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aiafw4/day_1_of_delve_rorqual_bots_not_being_banned/eemi4ev/)
---
Please explain this, then. Again, I've never owned a rorq, nor done any activity that could benefit from this. But saying it is impossible is downright ignorant and incorrect.
---
I hate botters as much as the next guy. I hate rorq botters in delve even more, because grr goons and all that.
---
But let's face reality and not call everybody a botter because we don't like them. If anything, I believe my demonstration shows an error in CCP rules that CCP should account for.
---
There is a difference.
---
Botting IS a major issue, because it's against the EULA, while lack of lowsec gate to Stain really isn't.
---
And shitposting with the intent of solving an ACTUAL issue is very different from shitposting for the sake of laughs.
---

I've been told that focus fire reduces drone dps by 10% or so.  I've never tried to prove or disprove that.
---
As I said, you can bind alt+tab in the macro, so all you do is scroll with the mouse wheel.
---
Yes, This showed up for more than the character that created it, that extractor had been running for two weeks.
---
The obvious hole was gone after a few days when I moved the ECU.
---
oh is that why his cloaky campers fucked off? cool
---
remove agency
---
But botting is multiboxing. What a noggin swirler. 
---
Is this the salt for our "due to a total lack of competence on BL side" Ping? :D   
---
So precious. Anyway, I am totally for banning bot rorquals or Broadcasting rorquals. I don't think you'll find too much in goons, but anything that drives mineral prices back up is good. :)  
---
I would also like the salt about the crumbling narrative if delve would be bot free. Maybe then these salty doodes would realize that most of it is just legit mining. 
---
did i miss something? can you clue me in on the Rorq bots? 
---
T3Ds have to compete with assault frigates now. They have slightly higher, but comparable DPS, worse speed and agility but higher range and tank (not counting ADC).
---
In general, that makes T3Ds more viable in fleet settings where tank and application are king, but less favored for small gang and solo.
---
Jackdaws and Confessors are the most popular at the moment. I think TEST briefly tried Svipuls, but quickly dropped them again.
---
Was expecting to see some interesting mining bots to take out my pitchfork. Was disappointed that OP didn't know how ice excavators work. 
---
What happened to the thread with the ice miners.
---
Why do u know they are not looking into it? ignorrant crybabies, reason if he isnt banned is maybe because ccp didnt find any else bad in the logs
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
Ah... I see? Why is this so confusing...  So should I use Vespas or the resistance hole drones?
---
Because it doesnt require an investigation to make sure you're actually doing it.
---
As long as the subs are paid, CCP will have their one anti-bot dude work his 8 hours a day so they can keep saying "We are doing alot to combat bots." The thousands of bots he doesnt get to, can mine in peace and the money  keeps the lights on. 
---
Your bad posting is still wanting of ELO's level of shit. Therefore your edgy reply only warrants this reply get gud.
---
when buying a character, what is the "account info" that is to be sent along with payment?

is the buyer or seller expected to pay transfer fee if it is not specifically stated?

It'd be a better performance than his last excursion to Delve

You think?  You're the one spewing F1 flavored spodbrain bullshit.  
---
wtf
---
but you have to realize when you do it at that speed you are going to miss quite a few rorqs as you are not going to completely time every click correctly.
---
Drone: shut up your not my dad!
---
Payout's higher, but the real difference is the infrastructure of a group in null. Not even talking the fucking blobs, but most alliances will have a functional industrial core for lower cost hulls, opportunities for passive isk making like PI or reactions. Just more ways to make more money than you can in low.
---
until the fighters shoot the jackdaws
---
fit?
---
well go see for yourselves, in esoteria/delve if you decide to go there and avoid all the hics with cynos that drop 5 supers on ur t1 frig, pretty much all krabbing is non bots and tackling vnis/rorqs to bait people warping in their random subcaps is pretty viable before the supers arrive. go to the bot regions, everything docks up the second you enter local
---
personally, I'm a bit sad that he's gone. been flying with BB for months now and I enjoyed having him as FC a lot.

it does not do mail tho :/

Got into wormholes a few years ago, been playing since 2003 and its the most fun I've had since the beginning. Just remember to bookmark that return wormhole if you don't have probes :)
---
True and congratulations you formed a coherent sentence without telling someone to kill them selves.
---
Drone auto-aggro should just be removed, it's antique code and turned off in PvP anyways.
---
uhm...  do you have a source for this? eve uni wiki seems to disagree
---
&gt; The "Focus Fire" option, when selected, will direct your drones to concentrate all their fire on one target until it is destroyed, or until you direct them to engage a different target, instead of spreading their fire on multiple targets.
---
Because he is not banned? There is nowhere go. There is no need to even look into it as the evidence is clear.
---
They dont want to ban him, so they are trying to find reasons not to (by doing nothing).
---
By who?  Anything with a scram is a poor choice for VNI hunting since the VNI will almost never be sitting at zero.  You will have a much higher success rate with with a retri or cloaky t3.  
---
If you’ve got any intel on bots in Test hit me up.
---
It was more a proof of concept rather than anything else, and while not perfect, I stand by the statement that you can recall the drones of 20 rorqs in 1 tick.

I'm not saying CCP is perfect, but this sub really likes to get up in arms over botting: "but I reported this guy two days ago and hes still botting!". Imagine how many invalid botting reports they get. Almost every single market "bot" posted here is from someone new to markets upset that other people are better at it than them.
---
Damn.. I remember when you used to get one every 5 minutes in Black Rise.
---
Pretty much fessor at the top then hecate Jack and svi in that order
---
Honestly FW is where its at. However, when FW zones are slow or dead we end up going to provi because it isnt too far away.

If anything check out Molden Heath or Derelik lowsec. They seem pretty active.

---
No Damage Control?
---
1. They replenish, rate is hidden and impossible for you to calculate as you can’t really track other players extractions
---
I think it works like this 
---
Every extractor cycle at end of cycle it checks what’s extracted and reduce the material with that amount.  
---
At daily downtime it replenish. 
---
Also at downtime the moving sweet spots moves (unsure).  
---
Since your not alone you will overlap with others and burn out the sweet spot faster.  
---
My suggestion is 
---
Either 24h cycles or 3day cycles with max skills 3day should be enough to fuel t0-t1 factories.  
---
If your slacking then you can accept lower productions by building Tier 2 materials on the planet and not using extraction planets and factory planets.  
---
I always have basic t1 manufacturing on my extraction planets as it saves me round trips.  
---
Always do pi with a goal.  
---
I want to do X and go all in for it.  
---
Robotics for example.  
---
Warning on gas giants they eat up your fitting room fast by the sheer size.

EVE have serious **lack of lowsec gate to stain** issue and annoyed players address this in worst way possible - by shitposting about every activity as **related to lowsec gate to stain** ... on reddit.

You cant make a copypasta of your own post

The internet doesnt work that way!

Its not fair!

ITS 2K19 AND THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN EVE IS HOW MANY ROUQS YOU OWN AND HOW MANY HOURS A DAY YOU CAN SUCK CROCKITE.

That’s the point of the joke, only in game poors would wince at a 8m repair bill when citadels *exist* 
---
hallmarks from large plexes are trash
---
Does anyone have a BR
---
the only thing you do with your hel is camp plexes cloaked in asakai and your kb is full of frigates kills , you dont really deserve the 1000th killmark.
---
I personally use this fit when roaming Null as it has a fairly large engagement window. It isn't built solely to hunt VNIs or else I would likely drop some tank for hyperspatials. 653 DPS cold.

My understanding, having done PI off and on since Tyrannis, is that the PI gets sucked up by extractors, and gets put back in elsewhere on the planet. if you have extractors running 24/7 on a given location, it will go dry (or relatively so) pretty fast, but the resource "blooms" elsewhere on the planet to match.  
---
So, ideally, if you have multiple extractor characters on the same planet, they should not be next to each other, and spread out. This can be exploited if resources are largely on a belt near the equator (Gas), or near the poles.
---
Gee...I wonder why they are all frigates...when you drop on anything than a destroyer with your titan fleet
---
[You're not my Supervisor!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEwlW5sHQ4Q)
---
Don't think you can even initiate a safe log if you have probes in space 
---
I tried POS-Party when another wh corp was dissolved I had to take an unexpected leave because of RL. I finally got the chance to log back on and found that POS-Party had been evicted and all of my assets that were in the hole were destroyed (95% of my total assets) and I had been kicked from corp, Probably due to absence from game but never asked. I lost so much I could not get back into corp without ships and could not buy them again without Isk. The thought of Hi-Sec grinding to get ships back was unthinkable. Now I read about EVE on reddit and wonder what might have been if I had been able to stay. 
---
By plenty of people. Do you want me to give you a list of names?
---
While a point may be "better" for VNIs, it is also interchangeable with a scram on that fit with literally zero fitting impact. I personally choose a scram because it allows me to engage other ships better as am I a blaster boat, and the amount of times I lose a VNI between scram &amp; point range is low enough that it is acceptable to me.
---
A hecate being used to hunt VNIs does not make a retribution a bad choice - I never said hecates were the best at hunting VNIs - I answered the OP's question as to **what** they were commonly used for. The two are not mutually exclusive.
---
Also the fact that you brought up a cloaky t3 is fucking hilarious. First, it is literally 10x the cost of a T3D. Second, it has significantly less agility &amp; speed than one, and anyone who has hunted VNIs knows that getting from the gate to the site as fast as possible is the single most important factor in "success rate."
---
&gt; worse speed and agility
---
This is straight up incorrect. Propulsion mode gives some T3D fits a sub-2 second align time, and with the AB/MWD speed bonus, the effects of overheating prop mods are substantially larger in T3Ds than AFs.
---
The three primary advantages AFs have over T3Ds is 1) Assault Damage Controls, 2) Sig Radius bonuses, &amp; 3) Higher base resists due to being a T2 ship.
---
Damage, speed, &amp; agility all go to T3Ds.
---
Clean casino operators had a chance to shut down their operations when the rules changed, without risk of ban. Others were caught RMT'ing and were permabanned. Since the ISK was tainted, most of the 'bankers' who received it had their wallets zeroed.
---
You could have asked ur Corpates to move ur stuff. Usually wormholers will move out ppls assets that have RL emergencies.

Soooooo don't drop a fucking super on FW plexing subcaps?

It was a good ruse well played :) - great video btw. I actually liked the length because it really got across what an absoloute slog that battle was.
---
wormholer btw
---
Thanks for all the feedback guys really appreciate it! This post actually got more attention than I thought it would so thank you. Great suggestions here too. I’m currently in a wh Corp that I very much enjoy, we have a nice culture of doing just about whatever we want so I figured I’d go pvp for a couple days like this, that’s all. So probably won’t be getting into actual FW. But I’ll keep sticking around the complexes and see what happens. o7
---
I just had someone trying to explain me how Linux was fundamentally better than Windows, and all my problems that have ever happened on Linux were simply because I sucked. It was fun.
---
Return to the game, fit a Probe (or equivalent) and start again running safe relic/data site, save some isk then find a new Corp. 
---
You could put a reminder on your Eve calendar?
---
When your most expensive kill of the week a 150M frigate is lol
---
Right.  And if we removed all the bots from the game, there would be 10,000 actual players.  If we removed StainGuy posts from reddit, we'd have a similar reduction in posts.  Therefore StainGuy is a bot, and an annoying one at that.  Prove me wrong. 
---
I was not able to log in. My own fault for moving everything into the hole. I still love the EVE community and read this sub everyday for my fix.
---
Another nullsec complaint about irrelevant content on their precious shitposting sub. These Rorqual people are like Apple fanboys. No matter how shitty their game preserve mmo is, they’re still going to claim that the walled garden of Sov Null is better because it just works.
---
EXCUSE ME! It was fit...
---
With a MWD and like... inertial stabs =p
---
Completely disagree with you there bud.  There are a lot of people who will not get safe if they don't see a ship on scan.  If you are in a cloaky you can bm someones site if they do warp off move on and come back in a minute.  Much less likely to warp off if they think you are just passing through.  I've seen a million people use a cloaky Loki for hunting null ratters and exactly zero hunting them with a blaster hecate.
---
If you were able to remove all bots from the game without significant negative impact to playability, you would beat wow.
---
You're name is from Homeworld Cataclysm (At least the Sometaww bit). Therefore you get an upvote.

I'd give you two for the achievement. But Reddit doesn't allow it.
---
Transfers work by moving a character from one of the seller's accounts to one of your accounts. You need to provide the seller with the Username of your account so he can initiate the transfer.
---
The seller is the one who must pay the fee to initiate the transfer. That fee is baked into the price of the character.
---
Yeah they didn’t even take any sov. What losers! 😂👌😉

Elo doesn't actually post on Reddit.

“Balance” hahahahhahaahhahaahahhaha

I'm going to do that as well
---
alt+tab and shift+R are 2 different actions...
---
In your video you only show one action, and using scroll wheel or any physical means to broadcast commands like using wooden dowels is bannable for multiboxing.
---
Last time I showered that long was after having sex with a girl I didn't really like. Couldn't wash her smell off.
---
So what's your story there?
---
You stay docked a lot don't you.
---
Even a quick glance at hecates on zkill would tell you your experience of blaster hecates hunting VNI's is severely lacking.
---
ahac zealots were an interesting meta, but ahac t3cs were cancer and i'm pretty glad they're gone
---
I use a VPN sometimes CCP don’t care, I also travel between countries a lot like a homeless retard and they don’t care
---
Ffs I’ve heard people account hacking that get warnings from CCP... so I don’t think you have to worry too much about getting in trouble
---
Lmao you bragging about not being caught is like some tengu bragging he wasn't caught in room 4/5 of a plex.
---
Agreed. Players are responsible for stopping botting, and as such, drastic measures must be taken. First and foremost of these measures should be the shutdown of all renting organizations, and ceding territories currently being rented for the good of the game. As we all know, the only legitimate reason to rent is to run bots; any actual humans who want to PVE just join Goonswarm Federation instead.
---
Alternatively, if your playstyle is so risk-averse that you get anywhere close to 1000 killmarks without dying, you do not deserve to be further rewarded.
---
That's great that you had the most fun at those. But all the other shit being organized and properly accessible is the only reason you were able to put your thousands of hours into it... That's like saying the entirety of eve pvp should be exclusive to frigates because sometimes you enjoy flying frigates more 
---
Is the Vengeance any good for Assault Frigates?
---
1 year experience in WHs and in HKrab? Found the spy.

---
He fought like a Kilrathi. He was awarded for his bravery. Sometimes you win at the casinos.
---
Is the P.S really necessary? lol
---
Great idea - also more flexibility of resizing the window itself. NB: the ability to detach the results from the system map is already nice, but more improvement needed. 
---
I'm not sure how this can even be the subject of debate...
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/35683/solo/
---
There have been seven solo VNI kills by Hecates today alone.
---
To get a meaningful answer you should state how you intend to use your Vengeance and what you hope to accomplish with it. Assault Frigates of all races are nimble and can fit the assault damage control, so they have found a niche in securing initial tackle and tanking until backup can arrive.
---
Now jump it to a Ivana freeport and show us how much you can tank
---
This is an excellent guide, even for more experienced players!
---
I'd argue that removing all bots would dramatically increase playability.  It would also dramatically decrease CCP's bottom line and the ADMs of substantial parts of null. 
---
you tried \o/
---
gives no gfs either *wipes tear*
---
They can just meet me at the medium plex.
---
lmfao 
---
I love your apps reliably. I just wish you could slam EVE Droids fitter lock stock and barrel into Nova!!! 
---
#That would be amazing 
---
You bind a macro. With the first activation, it will shift+R. When you trigger/activate the macro again, it will alt+tab. Rinse and repeat. Theoretically follows CCP rules of 1 player input = 1 ingame action.
---
Now that will be my new tattoo!!!
---
Okay, I laughed
---
Can I buy that from u plz
---
Be nice dick!!!
---
It is now that they have TAPI as pets.
---
I was asking 'Is the Vengeance good compared to its competitors in clsss?'
---
I'm pretty slow in realizing it, but I finally got why you started this thread. In order for this to work better, you need to demonize one person, not make weird, vague, overarching accusations. Maybe it'll work better if you can find someone like that.
---
Show me your ship with 1000 killmarks and you can talk shit.  It's impressive no matter what. 
---
Snuff pilot talking shit about risk averse combat in lowsec.  My sides!
---
No one knows!
---
&gt; I've seen a million people use a cloaky Loki for hunting null ratters and exactly zero hunting them with a blaster hecate.
---
Surprise surprise, your experience is not indicative of the entirety of the Eve playerbase. **Again**, the OP didn't ask about the OP did not ask about T3Cs. He asked about T3Ds. Fucking stop bringing them up - they are 10x the cost and not even in the same ship class.
---
its not really the fact that we are risk averse, we do lots of stupid shit, problem is we are too blobby and nobody has the force to counter us
---
Getting blobbed is part of flying small gang.
---
You either avoid them or drag them out and frag tackle while not getting pinned down. That's always been part of the fun for me.
---
They patched that almost a month ago, the first mission used to give you 250k if you already had the skill to 5, now it just give you a low level market skill.
---
JFC do they at least burn out slower compared to other modules?
---
Focus fire makes them shoot the same target.

7 fights in 3 hours in non-FW is pretty good. Go to FW if you want more. Plenty of opportunity to 1v1 in complexes.

whew, i I smell the sea in this thread

Bite the bullet and buy a plex, get a pair of rattles and farm for a few days. Get a vni alt in a nullsec alliance. Run relics, anything to get you back in w-space with us :)

---
¿Por qué no los dos?
---
Were talking about t3 cruisers because someone said that blaster hecates were the meta for vni hunting.  I've had a look at zkill and it's literally three people using them for that.  Clearly the same three people trying to argue with me on here.  Retri Loki and kikimora are what everyone else is using.  
---
Ten dicks? At once?! Dude is trying to get you to beat his record! 
---
Apparently, yeah. It's mostly just LSH and Darwinism, though.
---
Hecate is bad news, especially on a gatecamp, because it’s so nimble. 
---
C4 Heavy Armor Corps - Same as C5 list you just seem to have forgotten them. 
---
Yeah kinda. I guess you are thinking about Jackdaws in a small gang environment. But Jackdaws are used a lot in really big fights to kill fighters, because you simply don’t have the time worry about them to kill them, and TiDi makes it pretty much impossible as well.
---
The fear is a function of logistics. It's much easier to lose them when you have brought a lot of them nearby and can reship fast. 
---
90% in the last 7 days have been 3 people.  Now look at Loki retribution and kikimora.
---
Your logic for 2-5/NS also applies to C3-NS whaling groups :)
---
I’d say Loki is probably single most common ship across all types of comps (missile armor, missile shield, arty shield, logi-links) logi cruisers (guard/scimi) next best flexibility, with overlap between guard and nestor, then kitsune/keres useful shorter trains. Sleipnir (arty shield) and drekavac also fit in to a lot of comps.
---
More than once, we stand down because we’re just tired of playing cat and mouse with your light fleets ping-kiting in PH staging.
---
But that might just be a few of your FCsz
---
HAVE YOU TRIED NOT BLOBBING MAYBE
---
You wouldn't believe how retarded that Hel pilot was.
---
There is a ship called the Rorqual. People make these scripts to automate them.
---
Come back to Geminate
---
And you can get lower sp newbies in brick tanked VNIs for more DPS which is awesome ISK/hr for newer players that don’t have Nestors or vnis. The Nestors act as logi and drone bunnies and the vnis can fit salvagers when they sit at 0 on the MTU.

This dude is really trying to justify camping frigates in a super 1 jump from a novice system. 
---
That sounds like an absolute pain if not everyone has alts in every corp. 
---
thanks!
---
&gt; Were talking about t3 cruisers because someone said that blaster hecates were the meta for vni hunting.
---
No, this is 100% false. Someone said Hecates were used for hunting VNIs in the context of T3Ds, not that they are the meta for hunting VNIs. Learn to read dude. Go sperg out over your cloaked T3Cs in another destroyer thread.
---
I haven’t used it, but it will depend on what you want to do. If you’re going to use it as pure tackle, it will never be as good as a jaguar, for example. 
---
I love wormhole space, it's basically an entirely different game. A much better one too.
---
Can we get some clarification on if this is true, probably the most interesting thing I have seen posted all month
---
Yeah happened to me too in the middle of a big fight and occasionally when traveling. It is quite annoying and I need to restart the client in order to fix it.
---
you name confused me for a second
---
Admitting the problem is the first step. 
---
If I launched 1000 frigates and killed them all, would it be impressive?
---
Dude that’s your issue that you don’t enjoy it then not mine lmao
---
cant tackle someone when unable to land on 0, calls himself a hunter.
---
why not both.... join goon and bot ?
---
arent you the guy who killed your mom

Critical Hit

No one is trying to claim that the loki, retri and kiki aren't ubiquitous. But the claim that the hecate isn't use for solo hunting is totally false.

I ran rr orcas at one point in hisec that could be left afk for ages. Just kinda treated them like vni that nobody would hunt because they are obnoxious to kill. Just split drones and leave them for a few hours. Rinse and repeat. Wasn't really much money but I just kinda pretended it was like PI but I had to check it a few times a day from work.

Been outta the game for quite some time and have never really done solo PvP, So ill keep the newbie flag for now :)
---
You could've just stopped after the first three words. The rest of us did.
---
I didn't make that argument. The argument I was making initially was that often, when the points don't matter, you can have a lot of fun and just get lost in how free the experience is. Instead of playing for glory, you're playing for the joy of it. If the game isn't fun when the points don't matter, it's not much of a game. 
---
My general experience in Eve has been the same. The most fun ops I've been on were small gang experiences, where the objective was simply "good fights". The major strategic ops where you just anchor and F1 are interesting, especially when taken as part of a larger campaign, but are not the joyful exposition of individual skill, playing for the sake of nothing other than playing. 
---
I'm not saying that I didn't get a lot of enjoyment from the organized hockey. I loved it, and still love it. I'm very grateful that my parents were in a position that I was able to treat hockey as a profession growing up, and have a lot of great memories from tournaments, even if our team only managed to win the toilet bowl trophy (losing every game and getting flushed out of the tournament). 
---
It's a different kind of joy, it's the joy of accomplishment after lots of work, it's not the joy of being free and simply enjoying oneself. Both are satisfying, one matters to other people, the other only matters to yourself. A game that can be both of those things is a great game. It's part of the reason I've been playing Eve on and off since 2006. It's incredible to see all your hard work come to fruition, and incredibly satisfying to defend your hard work, but it's also a joy to troll through low sec with no objective beyond a simple fight with some random dude (or whatever it is you enjoy doing in Eve for no other reason than you find it fun). 
---
I'm curious, do you take each ship into the same site and split up the site or do you scan down the next while the other is completing a site? I'm curious what benefit you are finding to this method. 
---
This guy is a morrow. He made some videos showing ice excavators returning to the rorqual every 12 seconds. As if the pilot is manually doing it to not have the drones wander to far. Yet this is basic drone behavior since I've excavators have a cycle time of 12 seconds. 
---
People told him that but he's being a morrow saying it not. 
---
Not aligning out to an anom between bombs? Scrub &lt;3
---
But then they might not win.
---
Until they shoot you = work correct
---
On this sub? Probably not. In general? Sadly yes
---
It's pretty good. Armor tank means you've got a nice low sig radius combined with the MWD bonus, and extra armor resists make it a tough nut to crack. 
---
Drones should be piloted the same way as fighters to make people actually have to pay attention. 
---
Also it's fun as shit. 
---
This guy is doing a fantastic job of trolling.
---
One day he will grace me with his 200 rorqual bots.

Stop harrassing poor units or they´ll go rogue eventually we all know what happens...

You lose out on reps though.
---
Yes pm dalchi in game and I can get you hooked up with my Corp they are a great bunch of guys and mostly only do pvp, loved my time being there so far.

Lol cant wait for ccp to kill repair costs.. Sooo dumb.. Relic of a bygone era of EVE. 
---
Just use a citadel.. 
---
Yup nrds is so dumb and useless, also the fact that there kos checket barely even works now since esi. Better way to do it would be have neut corps go through an application process if they want to be nrds 
---
Well it's not like it deters gankers. I've made 10+ jumps with a -10 Talos just to test the align on the fit. 
---
So you spend 17 hours grinding to play the game. Excluding isk you may need to grind to get pvp ships. You could also work flip burgers for 2 hours and be able to sub and have a little left over. 
---
What the fuck is LSH?
---
You know, Fax police webs before they do anything else. So testing align time isn't going to work.

Those areas of null are filled with AFK rental overlords. If you want any of it, you can probably take it.

You can be scout or tackle instantly. No waiting. Many roles to fill in fleets which only require knowledge and experience. 
---
Ohhhh, so you didnt mean dual boxing Herons? You was referring to the shield boosters?
---
With the exception of BLOPS, remove the ability for all sub caps to bridge.  When a cap or super cap jumps to a cyno, allow a certain number of subcaps to accompany (be carried) via linking of navigation systems.
---
If you're going to do that, you have to heavily up the rewards to compensate, because nobody's going to spend that much time and effort for the shit returns that VNI ratting provides.
---
I do think this would be a good idea, however. Increase the amount of attention/effort needed to rat, but then, also make sure that it's actually *worth* that effort.
---
Either this was funny in your head and you don’t know how to post, or you are just genuinely dumb. Money is on the latter. 
---
That could work
---
Its not bots.. they are just afk

Nobody actually rats in VNIs, they're all automated.

This is from someone who tried to kill me today while I ratted in my VNI, though I docked before she found me. And then 10 minutes later she got killed. (Yes I gloated a fair amount)
---
Looks like she successfully killed another VNI with that before meeting her demise.
---
How do you do that?
---
Yep, drone assit is good for that :D
---
it's like, *the* only way new players can feasably rat, but ok

---
funny that after 15 years this bug is still in the game.
---
but well CCP only said like 200 times they work on drones AI blablabla .....
---
I ratted in a VNI for a long time until I had the skills and money to get into more advanced stuff.
---
Besides that, would increasing the effort (by reworking the mechanics) and reward not help to curb the botting problem?
---
Effort, doubtful. Reward... Mmmmnah.
---
Reminder that it's not like it would make things *that* hard. You have to send things into range and hit the attack button, rather than let them attack automatically, what a challenge, it's almost like every other weapon type.
---
Jackdaw isnt the easiest to use for solo since it tends to explode in your face if you make a mistake (overheating is atrocious), but the range is great.  I honestly think that if ccp believes these ships need a nerf, the way to do it would be to 0 out comps in mids while in attack mode, with the tradeoff of getting our faster lock time back. That will hurt the fleet jackdaw more than the solo/ small gang one.
---
I think svipuls and fessors need an agility buff.
---
Solo Assault frig vs solo t3d 75% results in assault frig winning if both have max skills (exluding hecates).
---
Probing is a strength, they are good at hunting lil fuckers who warp to a safe, a small scanning hull bonus would be nice, but its not needed.
---
&gt;day 1
---
I'm pretty sure it's been longer than that friend
---
&gt; As fleet sizes go up in number the jackdaw and confessor see the most use, jackdaws being a fairly common doctrine for larger alliance's due to their missile range
---
Yeah, this. To tack on, a very common doctrine as well is Jackdaws + Scalpels or Kirins. This fleet is high dps (for long range frigs), survivable, and slippery as fuck. Very fun and very dangerous.
---
I was imagining that more would be done than just a simple change to drone controls.
---
Consider incursions, where you absolutely have to be paying attention most of the time or you'll get blown to bits by the rats. Obviously, incursions are group content while VNI ratting is mostly a solo activity (relative to a single site, that is), but I think a similar design concept could be applied for anomalies to be less forgiving of brain-dead orbiting and require more actual piloting.
---
Force the player to react to unpredictable and changing circumstances, instead of just throwing piss-easy wave after piss-easy wave of retards at them that all proceed to focus a ship they have no hope of breaking while its drones mindlessly tear them apart.
---
And yet, there are Eve online players, that claim Earth is flat...

It would be trivial to add target and send drones to a ratting bot, theres super bots so we know its done. So the effect on bots would be minimal. Effect on real people significant
---
Despite the fact that you *will* get blobbed in Faction Warfare space it's still your best bet for finding 1v1 fights. You'll get blobbed everywhere... that's just the nature of the game. But the gate mechanics of FW plexes at least give you a fighting chance to either run from the blob, to kill it's bait before his backup arrives, or burn away from the bait when backup arrives. Which means plexes are attractive for other solo players like you looking for 1v1 fights.
---
Kiting ships like your Tristan fit are a good choice if you know there's a lot of gangs roaming about. If a gang's bait is AB fit you can just warp away if a blob arrives. If he scrammed you you were dead anyway, at that point the blob is just irrelevantly whoring on his solo kill. If he's also a kiter you'll both end up way off the button and you have a chance of killing him and getting away before the gang can influence the fight.... or sticking around if you're faster than the rest of the gang and picking them off one by one.
---
But... switch it up too. Other players *will* check your killboard before engaging and if they know you're kitey they ARE going to come with anti-kite and you'll be dead. I tend to rotate between scram-kite and kite fits with a few brawl fits thrown in from time to time.

Nice pics 
---
I had no idea... Just shows how much I know lol
---
His gunless, MWD, shield fit is perfectly fine.. pretty much the standard kiting Tristan fit.
---
The great thing about Tristans is that they are the most flexible T1 Frigate and you never know what it's going to be when you go up against one: High DPS brawler, neuts, scram kiter, kiter. They'll all wreck you in their own unique way if it's the right matchup for them. 
---
The gist of it is:
---
Jackdaws are the most popular for large fleets since they’re idiot proof for F1 monkeys and have long range. The rocket brawler Jackdaw is kinda bad. The ship is also a little slow so not popular for small gang.
---
Confessor is the best for a small gang with the beam snipe fit. Amazing anti tackle, dps and range in a cheap package with good speed too. Again the brawling fits are terrible and only see use by those who don’t realise it.
---
Hecate is the only one properly viable for brawling due to massive dps at close range, full tackle and reasonable tank. You can also fit it in a sniper configuration and while inferior to the fessor, it has the dank sub 2 second align for gatecamp immunity and 100% safe warp ins.
---
Svipul is garbage tier. There’s no point fitting it with a ram autocannon fit since it will still lose to most t1 cruisers and AFs completely eclipse it as heavy tackle with their superior resists and adc. The kite arty fit is viable but once again inferior to its alternatives. The only thing it has going for it is solid speed which can be nice but most AFs are faster.

Because Corp A finds a rorq like 4/5 holes deep in the chain, now you need a toon in corp A to give warps for corp B/C and D, given you don't want to hole fire on the scanner and don't want unnecessary probes in the static of the miners. 
---
Either that or you need to transfer the BMs using an Alt in Corp A to corp B/C and D

Just the shitpost on /r/eve that we have come to expect... every... damn... day...
---
Thank you for the excellent post! 
---
I try to explain to lots of the lost Null Seccers along the way looking to find meaning in their EVE existence. They quite often fall on our doorstep because we are right there on the precipice of being the truest of WH entities. The only group that can truly claim that title would be SC/Eve-Scout. We try to leave WH space the way we found it - with no trace of activity whatsoever after the party is over.
---
When people come on over to discuss the WH continuum I have to be a straight shooter. Diving chains and consistently scanning at all hours of the day is grueling work, especially when people are used to AFK ratting in relative safety (See: "HS 2.0") When people first start out in wormholes it is truly a pretty astonishing sequence of events to behold.
---
I've taught new players and old alike the joys of WH space - for all deeds one wishes to accomplish - be they benevolent or malevolent.

Who are we to judge.

How many units of ice does one drone cycle return?  And how much do you get if you recall the drone before the end of the cycle?
---
(The answers are 1 and zero).
---
So if they were actually recalling the drones when they "got too far away", they'd get zero ice.  That's not a terribly effective bot.
---
It's almost like during your ice mining experience you mined it like it was regular ore and got as close as possible to the rock.  Which with ice reduces your yield considerably.
---
This happens because ice mining skills decrease cycle time, while ore mining skills increase yield per cycle.  Since travel time is your limiting factor in Rorq mining, you want to position your Rorqual differently for ice.  You want your ice miners to *not* reach the rock so they don't have to fly around it to get back to you.  And since they can only mine for 12 seconds, you can pull that off by positioning your ship well.  You may want to boost your drone's optimal range instead of travel speed to help accomplish this - slower drones that mine from further away are better than faster drones, because they aren't on the far side of the rock when they end their cycle.
---
Ore cycle time is too long for that, so you want to be as close to the rock as possible to minimize travel time when mining ore.
---
The scramkite Torm is lowsec-centric, but the Kestrel AFAIK is great no matter where you go, as is the Slicer and Hookbill.
---
See above. 
---

Yeah, with the falloff bonus you have a huge falloff range with arty even without any ambit rigs or TEs, so you can easily sit \~12-14 km away from people and then just volley them down with 280s. It's super tight on fitting though, PG especially, so it does desperately need AWU 5, though you only need Projectile Rigging 4.
---
With an OD the Rifter is also quite fast, easily on the level of non-speed-fit Executioners/Atron, though cap is much worse since it doesn't get the role bonus to reduce tackle mod capacitor use.
---
Truly awesome and a great tribute

I used to, but prefer the DPS from the 3rd DDA as my passive tank is fine without it and the EHP I'd get from the DC2 won't help me break some of the nasty tanks I've seen. I think DC2 is a fine pick but I got ~40DPS out of the 3rd DDA.

We where out, fighting in a for us expensive fleet. A cyno opens up. If they jump in a fleet with Heavy Interdictors, fast tackle or carriers we can quickly loose tens of billions. We have to make a quick decision. Our FC asked *"\[Do\] we need to MJD?"* but all I hear is the command *"We need to MJD!"*
---
I MJD 100km away, leaving our fleet with only 1 logi. Because of that our command destroyer Pilot makes the decision to extract everybody, leaving the scramed fleetmember behind.
