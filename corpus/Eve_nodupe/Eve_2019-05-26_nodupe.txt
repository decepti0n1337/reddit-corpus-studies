Omg, this cracked me up

---
---
Thanks, Dunk. This is the kind of personalized attention and acknowledgment of harebrained schemes I expect from a member of the Council of SpaceMen.
---
What would you rather fight? 1000 duck sized Goons, or a Goon sized duck?
---
No what he said was we should take HP away from off tank and buff main tank of T1 battleships without considering the impacts of doing so. He wants to make them on par with a ship that costs drastically more, while at the same time removing any ability to create unique game play options by utilizing non-standard tanks. 
---

---
Again.. the blog is short sighted. I didn't say these ships didn't need changed. I said that before proposing blanket changes to an entire class of ships he should consider the broader picture.
---
This, what a bunch of shitters
---
It was 2012 looking back. 15 days in corp. Oh well no biggie.
---
Man.. this is some weird stuff.
---
This is why WH space is best space. You have to actually leave your yard to do anything. Meanwhile in null a 100 man Corp can comfortably sit in 1 or 2 systems and crab away forever.
---
&gt;And no other method seems to work for me
---
Just because you have trouble finding a source of ISK doesn't give you an excuse to exploit others for it.
---
Just send me 10b isk and i'll let them know you want standings set

Oh no, my perfect intel. Rude.
---
I totally agree though.
---
Im just trying to get to zkill dude
---
Everything except fatigue, fuck that extra tedious stuff like fatigue. Its a stargate.
---
I really like the idea of logarithmic damage cap tho. Not sure on the rep timers tho, could be a bit long (and boring).

Hello There /u/squizz
---
Yes, that’s annoying, no denying it. If you want nock, you can always mine Pyroxeres.
---
This is dumb
---
/u/squizz nice meme
---
&gt; What kind of retards actually believe they're owed something just because they want it.
---
Try CODE?
---
Ha!
---
Hey this isn't el'miner
---
Adding in that 2.5Mil is just about perfect PI skills and it will pay your PLEX. And synergies well with trade skills and I used it to pay for my second alt for a long time.
---
That being said I’m extracting all my PI characters and training dread alts cause C5’s &amp; C6’s are legit.
---
That's badass. Whew
---
I don't think you're clueless about how EHP and HP work. I've never once said that. What I said is your ignoring everything else that combines to make a ship viable. By buffing cheap t1 battleship hulls you are removing a lot of the viability of more expensive hulls. 
---
Answer one question for me: after your proposed changes, what incentive do I have to spend drastically more isk on faction or T2 battleships? Why wouldn't I just bring 10 T1s for every 1 of them?
---
so am i the only one clicking on zkill to get intel on someone and finding myself redirected here?
---
pls just let me look at dumbos dying tia

ZKILL HACKED BY THE MITTANI REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I just wanted to look at zKill :/
---
Eve activists? What a joke..
---
Because CCP has the logic of a potato.  The last 5 years of changes should prove that.  Including one coming for Tuesday \*cough signatures cough\*
---
It may surprise you to learn that wormholes are classified by constellation and region, just like k-space. Those are what those A-C, B-C, etc represent. 
---
The J-tag is just its system name, like any other.

Omg I thought I was crazy.... I have reset my phone about 30 times

Alright cool, so the largest groups are the Regions, and the smaller sub-groups of those are Constellations, or is that backwards? Also, any idea if those mean anything like they do in K-space? Thanks.

Did you know that perfect intel will kill the game, unless all you do is krab?

This is fucking great.

Hi mom.
---
About tree fiddy
---
Technically their is local chat in W-Space, but only a wormholer would know that.
---
It seems if an anom is farmed in one system, it pop again in another system in the same constellation
---
You are a total retard.
---
If CCP was captain of the titanic, instead of ordering for everyone to head to the lifeboats they'd turn the ship back around to ram the iceberg again
---
So even advanced statistics are not enough.
---
such a beautiful language
---
so yeah, he "fixed it"
---
gaymers rise up
---
And it's back to normal now but that was a Nice Meme from Squizz for about 20 minutes there
---
Being aligned with the Imperium I don't like the guy much, but man this was a good movie. WELL worth the 30 minutes of my life watching it.
---
Tldr they dont, the people paying their subs with in game money are largely multiboxing a minimum of 4 characters doing wormhole sites or like 10 miners. Only exceptions I know of have their main in a supercap ratting.
---
Did I hit a nerve? Must be true as butt hurt as you got. Enjoy life care bear.
---
"High Level Idea"
---
&gt;A frigate size T1 hull can only cloak for 1h with skills level 1. With skills to 5h it would become like 3h.
---
Oh no, not one of these crybabies.
---
Yeah, that would make sense, would be interesting if people worked together to farm sites this way. I wonder if the Region has any effect though, since in K-space the region effects things like what rats and navy are around, and also if you are able to remotely see the market while in that region.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
From what I remember when I was in a WH corp, somebody said that WH space was generated with the same seed or something that K-space was generated with, so there are a lot of similarities between some systems in both K-space and J-space, not sure if this carried over with the Regions and Constellations as well.
---
TLDR
---
OP is extremely lonely and displaying jealousy over the big dino. 
---
Cute.
---
meh, everyone who lived round there went to delve for a holiday
---
Won’t Caldari or Amarr forces attack me since I’m Minmatar?
---
Honest question, I just started and haven’t jumped more than 10 jumps away from my home base.
---
Well based on our corp member history that narrows possible people to just you. But I wasn't in corp then, I didn't join till 2013, but based on leave/kick history there was only a handful of other people who left corp around that time.
---
Sorry things didn't work out, but it looks like you might have just been cut for inactivity (assuming this person/KB i'm looking at is actually you and your currently in TEST)
---
lmao
---
Did they really subtitled "prop mod on" as "probe mod on"? I mean I understand not playing the game but really?
---
Astra is still considered a medium citadel
---
You're definitely getting on my nerves if that counts
---
There was something rather exciting about the good old days, before killboards, when you had to buy maps in a book to have on your desk - or wrestle with pdfs of every region.  You knew corporations that could end you by word of mouth, and literally got shivers when someone said their names on TS.  Would you make it through the null choke point today,  or was there a gank-a-geddon waiting to vapourise you.
---
Glorious.
---
we have other problems than available data being used for both(!) denying and creating content honestly...
---
If they didn't have this public map already, maybe they need to rename themselves to the black pinkie or something.
---
Strongest at Docking!!!
---
I get in a ship and go "pvp" when i see an entosis message pop up on my screen.
---
If i did not have that message i would not know there was something to do - I then would have missed out on the oppertunity for some small gang fun.
---
-Removing the entosis notifications seems to defeat the purpose of creating content  when you consider it from that apect.
---
almost like it was a joke
---
Surely if theres 100 friendlies in system it really shouldnt matter as if you get jumped there should be an instant response.
---
Oh don't worry I was joking too, I wouldn't want to upset my black hand handler (get it) after all.
---
I like how again you didn’t deny being a neck bearded loser...enjoy those hot pockets while you play in moms basement.
---
Nope. Unless you piss them off. If you go into you character Menu (Alt-A) and look at interactions and go to standings, you'll be able to see your corporation and Empire standings. 
---
The main 4 wont attack you until you get to -5.0 standing with them.
---
Should have been a link
---
Congratz!
---
LOL 
---
I mean ncdocked has been that way since before they hit those numbers. They dont need to just attack anyone because they can.  They built a force to ensure they never will be defeated, as well as retribution that is not hindered by the shit state of attacking during a sov war. 
---
Thanks ccpfozzie for being the one who sealed eve's  fate a few years ago with this sov wack a mole.  If fozziesov is ever changed I wish i could be there to see the look on his face when he is told to design something else because his ideas are trash truly.
---
Almost all hunters are fine with that, they need to check D-scan anyway.
---
Thats not me :). No reason to be defensive about something that happened in 2012. Maybe I was really fucking annoying on comms. I was overly eager to make isk.
---
Actually could be my character. I sold him years ago.
---
The letter in the Region corresponds to the wormhole class. The A- regions are C1, the B- regions are C2, the F- regions are C6, there's only one system in the G- region and it's Thera, and the H- region are C13.
---
The Wormhole Class determines what sort of wormholes are allowed to connect to the system, what sort of sites spawn in the system, the sizes of ships allowed to enter and leave the system, and (in the case of systems with special effects) the strength of the effect. Higher class systems have stronger (and more rewarding) sites and effects.   
---
And there's a Wormhole space political landscape that comes from the different classes of holes that people live in. In particular, there are three primary wormhole classes that play into the politics: C2 Null/5, C4, and C5. C2 Null/5 are C2 systems with connections to Nullsec and C5 systems. The C5 connection ensures good krab access and connections to other C5 groups to fight, while the Nullsec connection gives roaming. C4 systems are commonly referred to as "low class" but there are more C4 groups than there are C2 or C5 groups. C5 groups consider themselves the big boys and a lot of them frown upon the C4 groups and meme about DELETE C4 a lot because they've got nothing better to do after Hard Knocks and Lazerhawks moved out to Nullsec and joined the Holy Rental Empire.
---
&gt; Is it impossible for systems outside of a specific group to connect to another group? 
---
There is one case where this is true: C4 systems (anything within a D- region) *cannot* have any direct connections to Hisec or Lowsec, and can only directly connect to Nullsec via roaming wormholes that are so small that only Frigates and Destroyers can traverse them. (While Anoik.is [does list wormholes](http://anoik.is/wormholes) that connect C4s to known space, none of those wormholes ever spawn other than the M001 and Q003 frigate holes.) Otherwise, it's always theoretically possible for any system in any region of J-Space to connect with some system or another from any other region in space.
---
happy happy, etc.
---
No it doesn’t take the fun away, people PLEXing means I don’t have to pay for my alts.
---
Isk doesn't mean experience.
---
Oh fuck yeah thank you!
---
Yeah, that's how K space is organized and how wormholes happen to be organized as well. 
---
There's no real understanding to how these work in regards to wormholes as far as gameplay goes (as in constellations and region assignments don't have any effect on gameplay) other than serving as organizing elements for the class of groups of wormholes, their static (constellations typically all have the same static), and shattereds.
---
Tragedy of the commons?
---
Region, then constellation and lastly the solar system. Just like in k-space.
---
The previous commenter above already answered your second question.
---
No, it still is in any individual's best interest. That's a collective action kind of problem.
---
Cause CCP keeps making the same mistake.

Good to see WH folk lasting!
---
Here's to another 10 years!  
---
Prost!
---
&gt; Nobody really knows if they have gameplay influences (though there are plenty of theories)
---
The leading theory thats been tested by enough people is that wormholes share constellations among all the holes in the same region. 
---
I know at least one corp is setting out to control their entire region so they can accelerate the spawns of everything.
---
I know a lot of major wormhole players. Many of the serious ones warp to all the sites in competing holes in their region (some going as far as logging off alphas) so they despawn in 6 days and respawn elsewhere. 
---
#Region25Supremacy
---
Please do, I don’t want to resort to taking this roam to Jita to shoot PIRAT for memes
---
R is region C is constellation. To my knowledge region shares anoms and constellation info is benign.
---
Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Region not constellation. Have tested.
---
Sorry posting on this was not worth more effort than just a copy-paste. 
---
Was it hard for you to read? Solicited your intellect a little too much?
---
wait a second i can just press F 10 for this, hmmmm.
---
Thanks, somebody said that Constellations shared anoms, but I think region might make sense as well.
---
Happy birthday, fellas!!
---
known issue
---
oh poor you
---
(Clarification point: "k-space" isn't the right term. "k-space" refers to "known space", anywhere in High-Low-Nullsec. The term you're looking for is "j-space", referring to wormhole space and how every wormhole system's name is the letter J followed by a 6-digit number.)
---
CRY SOME MOAR

You must update some gate in tribute / vale are already dead.
---
Thanks for the detail.
---
I love how MMOS are in the casual gamer zone, yet all the ones in the endless void are MMOS. I think MOBA &amp; MMOs should be swapped but other than that it all looks good.
---
Make a capital ship that can self destruct in 10 seconds, when it does it kills every untethered ship in system, and costs 1trill isk to build. Make the superblob a risky play again.
---
Bots call for aid now? Those some good scripts.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s region. Thinking hard 🤔. I never really paid attention to constellation and I’ve never not found new anoms whenever I warp to all in a system with like 30. best guess. There’s like no hard literature. But IIRC there’s only a handful of systems in constellations and maybe like 30 regions.  So there’s around 100ish per region.
---
He said TEST, btw.  
---
  
---
Pretending TEST comes close to FRT in terms of botting is beyond retarded.
---
(reddit didn't give me the message notification for some reason)
---
They're mostly just filling the slots. Two LMLs contribute a tiny bit of damage for almost no fitting cost, but they also act as heat buffer slots if you're in a panic and need to overheat your guns. Unfortunately there isn't enough powergrid room to fit anything larger than LMLs (so you can't get any of that RLML goodness that other cruisers love).
---
Unless you plan on buying Omega after, only train Alpha skills. Just consider it an opportunity for 2x training for the first week.
---
And enjoy your damage + training juice (Cerebral Accelerator)
---
Will keep that in mind, thanks. Definitely would make anom spawning manipulation much more difficult in this case.
---
Prospect*
---
Op success...
---
I added an edit to the post you commented on. Idk if it’s useful.
---
It’s really not difficult. What my old corp was doing was seeding and tracking aññ region 25 wormholes. Their PVP home was in region 25 (so newbs can krab at home) and were encouraging people to move krabholes into region 25 to keep the spawning up. Also had a guy with a ton of alphas logged off everywhere.
---
Also bear in mind that shattered holes are a bit different. I’ve been in one (with another person confirmed logged off here) doing the C6 sites. The other squatters been doing C5 sites in here on Mon/tu/Wed and I’ve been doing C6 sites while avoiding them.... there’s been a constant 20-35 sites in here everyday. So definitely a shoutout to living nomadicly.
---
FRT bots are in FRT Treasury, their rental alliance. Legacy took in XiX who we all know bot as well as mangos, who were as we all know very innocent and law abiding on their server. They also very happily took payments to let KWG live happily in Omist while bitching about people tolerating bots.
---
Iceland has some great bands, my favorite is Solstafir: https://youtu.be/R8n8Uy5KmvU
---
Krabbing can get boring, especially if you crit and roll all your holes before hand. Going around nomadically, I think is the most pure WH experience, thanks for the info again.

I think you're projecting, but whatever helps you sleep at night

Mate, I replied to a comment comparing TEST space (Esoteria) and FRT space (Detroit/Insmother) specifically.   
---
CCP's data displays a massive amount of botting is a short timeframe by FRT.  
---
Now i see you're trying to make some point about TEST being affiliated with KWG, which has a fraction of FRT's representation in CCPs data, and Xix. But we were talking about detorid vs esoteria.  
---
If your goal is to derail any discussion because you hate TEST, we can also include panfam renters on the FRt side because they fight together.
---
3-4 if depending on skills, and I kill the drifter with an astra.
---
I have a particular set of skills.
---
Whats best way to keeping your space?
---
Bending the Knee to Goons and offering space to the Next Chinese Goons. 
---
So the won’t attack your space.
---
If you calculate everything to real money than yes it will take for some Guys the fun out of the game.
---
even if 500 plex cost only 500 mil
---
You either haven't looked at the botting data or you've convinced yourself that Treasury bots = FRT bots. You bring up FRT renters, but it's bad if I bring up KWG who paid TEST to live in Omist? Let's look at [some botting data](https://twitter.com/ccp_peligro/status/1126496159407792128?lang=en)  FRT not on the list, FRT's renters 5%. Mangos just got here but they utterly fucked their last server with bots. KWG I couldn't go more than 2j in their space without seeing (perfectly innocent I'm sure) identically named gilas all warping to some shitty pos stick, and 2% on Peligro's data. XiX who didn't even have to pay for their region 13%. But tell you what, next time I'll be nice and just let you pretend rental alliance = real alliance.
---
It's been proven to not be constellation. Most accepted site respawn theory is that it is region based but no one knows for sure.
---
Depends how you play the MMO's. I think it's reasonable to have them in both zones.
---
&gt; Answer one question for me: after your proposed changes, what incentive do I have to spend drastically more isk on faction or T2 battleships? Why wouldn't I just bring 10 T1s for every 1 of them? 
---
Because faction battleships still have more raw HP/EHP than T1. Also, faction (Navy, specifically) would receive a similar treatment, albeit more conservative as they already have fairly high stats. Since i did not "add" HP values to battleships, just moved them around, the original T1 HP/EHP values on a naked ship remain the same.
---
For comparison purposes, I will list the T1 Raven (modified) compared to the Raven Navy Issue:
---
*T1 Raven/Modified:*
---
Raw HP:  24k (12k raw shield HP)
---
EHP: 34.4k
---
*Raven Navy Issue:* 
---
Raw HP: 35k (13.1k raw shield HP)
---
EHP:  50.6k
---
In its current form, even before you do minor tweaks to the Navy Raven, it has 1k more shield HP and currently has 10k armor HP compared to the modified T1's of \~4.3k.  It has an identical range bonus and an application bonus, along with more alpha and the same dps (slower RoF, higher damage).
---
If we applied the things i mentioned in the article and shifted some HP around from armor or hull from the RNI to shield, it would provide a larger gap in shield HP between the 2 ships but the faction ship will still have drastically more raw HP which will lead to drastically higher EHP in comparison.
---
Things like the Scorpion Navy Issue is an even higher difference since you get the shield resist bonus. As it has 14.4k raw shield HP (2k higher than the T1 Raven) and 57k EHP naked.
---
For Pirate battleship comparison, i'll throw out the rattlesnake/barghest as they're both missile bonused and 1 is range bonused for comparative purposes. Also, the rattlesnake is already in existing doctrines.
---
Rattlesnake: 
---
Raw HP: 39.6k
---
EHP:  62.2k
---
Barghest:
---
Raw HP:  35.1k
---
EHP: 50.6k
---
As you can see, those ships absolutely outclass the modified T1 version in raw HP/EHP. By default, slapping on tank to either pirate or navy battleships is still going to inherently result in higher tanks than what the modified T1 battleships could achieve.
---
As far as T2 battleships go, i don't think we're going to see anyone fielding BLOPs as a mainline fleet ship as thats not what they are on a fundamental role/balance level. They are meant to sacrifice tank for a jump drive and do less damage than T1 battleships. They ambush. 
---
A BLOPs would die against a properly fit PvP T1 battleship in most cases. To put it simply, BLOPs are the "Rogues" of EVE. You wouldn't try to brawl a Warrior in a Rogue, unless you ambushed it with 3 Rogues. But in straight 1v1's, a Rogue is going to die to a warrior. Sorry if that comparison triggers you (I promise i'm not trying to draw comparisons to WoW/Fantasy MMO's), but its an easy example. That would remain with these changes. For Marauders, well, i think we both know there is almost no chance of a Marauder being a mainline ship at their current prices. Might as well just fly HAW dreads as your mainline ship.
---
He is wrong, Sites do not respawn based on constellation. This has been tested. The most accepted theory is that sites respawn within the same region but no one knows for sure and if someone says they do, they are either lying or wrong.

Roger that, I can't blame him though, like you said, most of the info is cloudy at best.
---
GrrrXIX and grrrmango, wtf do you think this is 2018??
---
This is a very good post :)
---
I dunno. I'm just getting the grrrTEST vibe from all this whining about alliances affiliated with TEST having bots and it's TEST fault. Yet NCPL affiliated alliances you're not whining about. 
---
I'm just so confused with your narrative.
---
you're dumb i'm done arguing with a troll
---
&gt; Yet NCPL affiliated alliances you're not whining about.
---
They're too busy docking up, so they at least aren't bitching about the big bad botter pets when their own pets are actually botting more. I wouldn't really mind so much if it wasn't for the fucking ridiculous hypocrisy, so there you go. Xix are also 3% above BOT somehow, so the incompetent twats have that going for them.
---
Congrats on the birthday and kudos to Exo for running one of the nicest w-space corps in the game :)
---
Is TDSIN recruiting?
---
&lt;3 fofo
---
Heh ... did install additional anti-malware software because i thought the redirect was based on something on my system and my installed software didn't recognize anything :D
---
XiX also has lived in the same place for years upon years. Only recently being evicted. They were untouchable for most of that time. Most stable space = safest place to bot. They hadnt been seriously challenged in how long. 
---
Plus your post history of constantly bitching about TEST. Pretty certain if BOT had 100% of the botting bans. You'd still blame TEST. LOL.
---
When TDSIN lived in c6 space we came to the conclusion it's not based upon constellation, and fairly certain its region based (conveniently all c6 systems are in a single region, that combined with higher site values makes them very appealing to set up in for PvE)
---
I've only formally been with EVE for a year (and spent almost that entire time as a Wormholer^(btw)) but during that time the name Olmeca Gold has gone from 'a silly man who steals excavators and memes on /r/eve' to 'Not the hero we thought we needed, but the hero we deserve'.
---
BDO is missing.
---
You're saying their mass scale botting is fine because they weren't challenged? I take it you believe strongly that botting is only wrong if people not blue to legacy do it.
---
Again dumbo. We're talking about the space. Esoteria is held by TEST and Detorid is held by FRT.
---
I can't believe i have to tell you this, but identical names does not mean people bot.  
---
If you hated bots half as much as you cry about TEST, you'd be angry about the amount of bots in Detorid exploding in relation to everyone else.
---
The black hand is the joke.
---
No retard. Stop thinking with your TEST hate boner and actually read what I'm saying. 
---
 I'm saying you're slanting your vitriol at TEST instead of botting in general. Only railing against TEST while purposefully ignoring anyone who points out other groups that bot as well. Who blatantly bot and do nothing about it as well. 
---
Also no. I think that botting is shit in general. And I don't support it in the slightest.
---
And its cargo hold will grow larger the longer it remains undocked.  
---
The last nail in the coffin for NC.
---
KWG had far fewer botting bans over the years than FRT treasury had in their short existence. It's safe to say that as far as "top botting entities" go, FRT treasury is at the top by a long shot.  
---
Having said that; shoot them all.
---
“Also fortnight” lol these are true facts
---
&gt; He wants to make them on par with a ship that costs drastically more, while at the same time removing any ability to create unique game play options by utilizing non-standard tanks.
---
Make them on par with what? Leshak was the articles example and the Leshak still does more damage than any T1 BS, the only ships that come even remotely close are max DPS Vindis or Rattles...
---
🦀15$🦀
---
You are just wrong on this.
---
Ah so you'll only talk about space? Is this because all your pets got deported? I'm not going to take anyone from TEST talking about bots seriously while their alliance is handing out regions to groups like XIX and mangos. 
---
If TEST hated winter bots half as much as they bitch about them, they wouldn't have had NIP with them.
---
What specs do you need to play smooth? I am really discouraged from getting through the tutorial because it looks like I’m playing a PowerPoint presentation
---
Nestors are still common for PvE and used sometimes in PVP, Rattles are still common for Home Defence due to no ramp up and longer range.
---
you're the guy that things there aren't thousands of eve players that don't use VPNs legitimately 
---
you somehow think that banning VPNs would have a measurable effect on botters 
---
you keep using the same unrealistic strawman arguments that don't legitimize your viewpoint, and keep restating them as if they do
---
you're a fucking retard
---
SPAI.
---
&gt; I'm saying you're slanting your vitriol at TEST instead of botting in general.
---
TEST are being massive fucking hypocrites over it, so they get the special hate. If they weren't so keen to bitch about people who contribute less to botting than they do I'd have someone else to complain about.
---
I was wondering what was up with your killboard today. Nice!
---
2nd most active pvp supers and titans in the gam
---
As an interview style maybe, but as a joint public bitching session on everything wrong with w space it'd be fine. Im pretty sure theres a fucking massive long list of shit all 4(? I think theres 4) wh csm candidates agree on.
---
I feel bad for cubic bistot
---
I don't mean to shit on the video, because it's genuinely good, but olmeca as a person is not someone you or CCP would ever want on the CSM. If you've ever seen his hate filled meltdowns in local, it's clear he is not mentally stable in any way, shape, or form.
---
I approve of this product and/or service. 
---
^(^Give ^this ^man ^your ^ISK)
---
I remember you hanging around when I was in Goons... you definitely put way more into the game than I do, but I can respect that you enjoy your playstyle and that was an awesome video. Well done man.
---
I think he's referring to the Titan jump.
---
So an event that had almost perfect intel and the ability to jump across the universe in less than 15 minutes.
---
Then where should DCS be accounted at?
---
NCPL and XiX both contributed to keeping BOT safe so their bots can bot in peace. 
---
I didn't see you post about that over the last 10+ years. 
---
But XiX collapses and crashes on TEST's couch. Kids with guns pay TEST to leave them alone. As they paid their previous neighbors to do the same. Why weren't you bitching then? 
---
When XiX was an untouchable monolith of Russian power. Where was your bitching then? 
---
When BOT sat there for YEARS. Where was your outrage? 
---
You're outraged only after they're surrounded by a TEST or sitting on TEST's couch. 
---
Ironic is it not? It's as if you hate TEST and Goons and they're the only ones who can do wrong in this game. 
---
Maybe you need a break from EVE. You seem angry and the dino and the bee hurted your feelings hard. 
---
I know progod, mittens, and vily hurt your feelings. But it's OK. Do you need a hug?
---
Can you share that fit?
---
Fyi c4s do get k space frigholes outwards.
---
This is what r/eve is about. I love it!
---
Idiot.
---
Like 4 of my corpmates are on SC2 right now according to discord.
---
I don't think jump range is an issue. I think being able to use the smallest, fastest ship in the game as a beacon to bring in the largest, most powerful ships in the game in a matter of seconds is the problem.
---
&gt;I didn't see you post about that over the last 10+ years.
---
&gt;why weren't you bitching when other people were paying KWG
---
&gt;why weren't you bitching about xix before
---
&gt;why weren't you bitching about BOT
---
&gt;why is your post history grr dino
---
Congratulations on reading someone's post history and being completely oblivious to the join date. I'm sorry that my feb 2019 account doesn't reach back the last 10+ years you illiterate fuck. Your entire comment shows up as half "i can't read" and half "other people did it so why can't we"
---
Those sort of insults makes me think you have an IQ of below 80.
---
It's over in the casino corner.
---
[thats the joke](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/012/132/thatsthejoke.jpg)
---
Theres albion right in the middle of this void.
---
Makes 2 of us
---
Yeah but aren’t C5’s with a C6 static sought after by all the major wormhole Krab hunters like Dura Lexx?
---
Mind = Blown.
---
To bad you can’t fit a DST :(
---
HAWs should be removed from the game entirely and Supercarriers shouldn't be able to field light fighters.
---
Carriers should be anti-subcap. Dreads should be anti-cap/structure. Supercarriers should be anti-cap. Titans should be anti-cap/structure. That's it, no exceptions (save for Doomsdays and utility modules).
---
The Leshak also costs nearly a bil for a decent fit. It only does that dps over a long ramp period and short range that makes it not viable for large fleet encounters. 
---
It may be a T1 battleship, but it is not in any way comparable (and shouldn't be) to regular T1 battleships that only cost $250m.
---
Lolol. Aww. "I'm new so I only hate the current botters. Fuck all the ones before Feb 2019" 
---
you're retarded kiddo. Claiming ignorance isn't your shield. 
---
XiX and Kids with Guns were getting before legacy was a thing. BOT and XiX has been botting since before TEST existed. XiX and Kids with Guns aren't part of TEST. 
---
But hey. We get it retard. 
---
You hate TEST. No one else has done anything wrong ever. Shut up and sit down.
---
No he means this: https://i.imgur.com/jxVL2jp.png
---
Otherwise, no there isn't a function anywhere that i know of to do what you want.
---
It's twice as high as yours?
---
Shoulda said they're null k space outwards, or at least i don't remember seeing a low or high one in recent memory.
---
I wish ccp would remove them, i like my c4 being w space only, don't wanna be reminded if those dirty k spacers :p
---
Be right back, creating similar images for other alliance's JG networks.
---
To nullsec only though.
---
Squizz can probably get eve players whatever he wants considering how critical zkill is to the game.
---
&gt; Aww. "I'm new so I only hate the current botters. Fuck all the ones before Feb 2019"
---
What in the actual fuck is the point of complaining about people who aren't currently botting? Holy shit is conversation with you really this pointless?
---
&gt;XiX and Kids with Guns were botting before legacy was a thing.
---
And then Legacy, who have decided they have some moral high ground over other alliances that harbour bots, decided that they were perfectly happy to give XiX a new region to continue botting and to take isk from KWG to leave them alone.
---
You love TEST. Anything bad they do is good, botting that isn't happening is more important than botting that is. Shut up and sit down.
---
Are medium drones fast enough to kill MWD assault frigates? I'm trying to figure out a bait VNI build to kill the VNI hunters that come into system.
---
zkill should go away honestly. It's too robotic to always be looking at that shit.
---
Who aren't currently botting? What? 
---
You have to actually be retarded. 
---
Like legitimately. Retarded. 
---
BOT never stopped botting
---
Frat treasury never stopped botting 
---
Good God you are actually legitimately retarded and you're gobbling that downy dick hard. 
---
If you don't know what you're actually talking about. You shouldn't be talking.
---
Right, that was the [2nd picture](https://i.imgur.com/UkLyJsI.jpg) in the album.
---
Damn, I was hoping since Elite Dangerous had a thing to do it, Eve would too. Oh well! Guess I’ll keep using Dotlan.
---
You're complaining that I wasn't bitching about every botter 10+ years ago. It may be news to you but not all the alliances from 10 years ago are still in the game now. And I'd also like to direct you again to the part of your comment I was replying to. Sorry if you can only see a reply to your comment as a reply to everything you've ever said.
---
&gt;"I'm new so I only hate the current botters..."
---
Poor Albion. I liked it until the bots took over.
---
Ok, so this is from the perspective of a C4 WH’er so it may not encompass large 100man fleets.
---
&gt; Shield bhaalgorns
---
Necessity is the mother of all invention, especially in WHs, Bhaals are super important and there isn’t a specific shield variant, whilst this would be a nerf to shield Bhaals, I doubt people would stop using them since they are so crucial to breaking enemy fleets.
---
&gt; Armor ravens
---
Stitch already covered this one and I don’t really have anything to add.
---
&gt; Armor scorpions
---
Probably doesn’t need changing tbh, it already has a very low base armor so you could leave as as-is, saying that, like the Bhaalgorn, it’s bonuses are unique enough that I doubt people would stop using it.
---
&gt; Hull domis
---
Considering Gallente generally have the best hulk tank options, calling it an off tank is a stretch, a lot of Gallente ships will run Hull tank since it turns out you can make it have obscene EHP...
---
&gt; Hull mega
---
See Hull Domis
---
&gt; Tempest both armor and shield
---
A lot of Minmatar ships have options in both Shields and Armor, saying that, this is a pretty good example that *could* be hit hard by the changes (or just convert some Hull to armor and leave Shields as-is).
---
&gt; Shield Nestor
---
Another one like the Bhaalgorn where it would certainly hurt, but probably wouldn’t actually change ship choices due to the unique Nestor bonuses
---
&gt; Shield vindi
---
Yeah, that one would hurt, we’ve only run shield vondis once or twice but when we did run them they were surprisingly decent.
---
&gt; Armor and shield machariels
---
6/6 slot layout and almost identical armor/shields practically screams “can run shield or armor as primary tank”, calling either one an off tank is questionable, see Tempest notes for potential solutions?
---
&gt; Armor nightmares
---
Never seen them run so a I can’t really comment on this, I guess it would hurt them? 
---
&gt; Armor and shield barghests
---
Same story as the Nightmare, I haven’t seen Armor Bharghests run before so I can’t really comment on them, saying that, Barghests already have quite low EHP, so I doubt a massive amount of tweaking should be done.
---
&gt; Also obviously Praxis
---
7/7 slots with identical shoes/armor/hull, the ship was designed to be able to run anything and it does that fine...
---
Overall I think Stitch’s ideas are in the right direction, I just don t think they need to be so severe, dropping the Raven to 6k armor and leaving the hull then buffing shields to 10k would be a more appropriate answer - it’s not so extreme as to nuke armor ravens but it does make shield fits more attractive (right now both the Hyperion and Dominic, both traditionally armor/hull ships, have more shield base HP than a Raven...)
---
You are definitely retarded and possibly illiterate. 
---
Brothers of Tangra and frat treasury still exist. They're not from 10+ years ago. BOT has been botting for 10+ years. Same with XiX. That's why their bans are so high. Frat treasury has been botting since they arrived. 
---
Jesus. I never thought I'd meet someone this retarded who survived longer than a week on EVE.
---
*Where do you think you are?*
---
Technically this may give them an edge. They unanchored everything in site.
---
&gt; You are definitely retarded and possibly illiterate.
---
God the irony of that from you. You were bitching about how I only hate, in your words "the current botters", I asked what the point is in bitching about non-current botters, and your lack of education on the English language has convinced you that I was replying to every statement you've made, rather than the specific part I quoted.
---
Is that a Star Wars themed Minecraft mod?
---
Just watched it and really enjoyed it. I love learning about virtual lives lived in all corners of Eve and it's great to see the evolving story of whale versus whaler told in this way. Nice work with the narration too.

At least CCP finally set the sale discount higher than the dollar/euro exchange rate so its worth something to European players.
---
Last sale (10%)  it was still cheaper for euros to pay the full $39.99 (€34.64 at the time) for 1100 Plex on Markee Dragon site than use the official sale price (€36 with the 10% discount.)

Congrats TDSIN

Did you check if you have any "projected effects"?

Actually a really decent game now. Just went F2P and has 10x the population than before. Highest pop ever in the game (including beta). It has better pvp, pve, and sov control than eve (played eve 12 years)

The notion of rolling a hole in anything but a capital gives me anxiety.
---
6%? How do you figure?
---
It would be nice if each group could trust others not to bot, but players can't effectively police other groups, there's no available enforcement
---
This is ccps task, them not enforcing the rules is effectively them saying it's not against the rules
---
It's as if I'm ignoring your cherrypicking of lines and holding you accountable for the entire conversation. 
---
Just gonna stick with you're retarded and not advanced enough for this conversation.
---
Where do you see rocket league
---
My cherrypicking of lines like replying to a statement? Lmao fucking austist, I'm so sorry if you're upset that you said something retarded that you don't want people to pick apart but I'm not the only person who can be "held accountable" for things said in a conversation.

" biggest thing they did in this war for 10 days of their deployment was anchoring a keepstar which is not even in a Tribute. " this part right here makes it clear you're baiting because any moron can look at dotlan and see the keepstar is on a regional gate to tribute.

Fortnight is the best game I won't play because if you ever need to distract kids for hours on end just load that up and go get shitfaced.

Not all pvp revolves around hunting krabs in mega corps. Sabre vs sigil is just as impressive as Loki vs VNI btw.
---
Far too safe...
---
So i take it you won't take panfam and FRT seriosuly either? Didn't think so, you're a hypocrite.
---
*Nobody* takes them seriously. The difference between panfam/FRT and Legacy is Legacy pretend to have some moral high ground while doing the same thing. Pretty funny to see dinos try to call me a hypocrite tbh.
---
What's D2?
---
You’re starting to see the difference between us (Panfam) and the imperium and their pets. While we’re lean and move about the map with precision in a weekend, they’re literally the opposite in that many of their members can’t function alone. You have to remember that they recruit anyone with pulse, which usually tend to be the “sheep”, and sheep will always need to be shepherded.... Yes this war will last a few months but their FC’s will burn out much sooner due to the massive load needed to guide so many sheep.
---
&gt;you're the guy that things there aren't thousands of eve players that don't use VPNs legitimately 
---
No reason for it. But you never gave a fuck about that. This is likely about you wanting to protect your main from your bots.
---
&gt;you somehow think that banning VPNs would have a measurable effect on botters 
---
Its basically the only way for most people to get enough addresses to pretend the bots arent run by the same autist.
---
&gt;you keep using the same unrealistic strawman arguments that don't legitimize your viewpoint, and keep restating them as if they do
---
You have no idea what youre talking about. I'm objectively correct. Your arguments are shit. There isnt one way to detect a bot. More data points are simply better.

I have a dream of a Corp that goes out into J-space for a week at a time, living out of their own cargo, Mobil depots, and a cloaky hauler.  Running sites with a cloaky salvager cleaning up behind and a scanner watching for holes, with a backup scanner/salvager watching another hole.  T3Cs running sites with subs in bay to scan when it's time to swap holes.  All pilots swapping every day to get a share of the duties....
---
It's just a dream for now.  One day, I may find some folk to do it and "live the dream!"
---
If you ever make the corp, I might be interested in joining that sort of group.
---
I love this video and it’s inspiring me to play more and get deeper. I think one of the reasons new players quit is they never leave highsec and never get to see the depth and variety of play style the universe has to offer. Videos like these are truly inspiring because it shows how much there still is to learn.
---
&gt;No reason for it.
---
just because you don't have a reason for it, doesn't mean reasons don't exist.
---
&gt;This is likely about you wanting to protect your main from your bots.
---
fuck off retard
---
&gt;Its basically the only way for most people to get enough addresses to pretend the bots arent run by the same autist.
---
MOST BOTTERS DON'T DO THIS.
---
how many times do you have to be told the same information and go in circles around it?
---
&gt;There isnt one way to detect a bot. More data points are simply better.
---
you seem to forget, once again, that you don't need to ban VPNs to disallow botting, just to track it to have the same effect.

Looks like new CCP pwners forgot that EVE players can do basic math.

I joined RvB for this exact purpose rather recently and there is almost no one on (at least US WC TZ). They started doing FW, I think because there wasn't much else going on. I'm about to dive into FW with 10 ships (training rigging now).

I have no opinion on the matter, I have only played the original's single player campaign way back when it came out.

Ideally it will last for 4 months.

No hackers, incredibly high skill ceiling, exciting e-sport, no bad microtransactions (Keys are expensive, which deters people from buying them. Plus you can just get stuff from rocket pass and trading), actually feels like a sport, etc etc.

Rocket League is about as close to a perfect game as we will ever get (In my opinion, at least).

yeah but you cannot use quantum entanglement to encode data as changing the state of entangled particles renders them unentangled.

Until you break jump cloak you are blind and the people in system are blind to you.  Gives you and your fleet a chance to load into system.  You could then have one person break cloak and take a look around before anyone knows how many people are in system

---
So, anyway... this is exciting, but... why? Why are you doing this?

Any suggestions for flying a Tristan I've been trying to get into pvp but I just lose ships I'm fairly new to the game started in 2013 but only played about 3 or 4 months worth.
---
FCON needed to die
---
I'm having trouble making isk I'm fairly new to the game about 3 or 4 months played total since 2013 spread out over 3 times I played. What's a good way to make money I currently have 14 mil.
---
I made another post that I was going to explore every unique WH that Eve has to offer, which appears to be just over 2600 unique systems. Just so it is not a waste and I have something interesting by the end of it, i'm trying to make a detailed spreadsheet with all of the data during that exploration that I collect so I can show it after I am done. The main one being how many times I jumped into the same systems and various other things.
---
Alpha clones were only introduced in late 2016...
---
like i said im very new, so you get kills by jumping out of a WH and surprising people? how quickly does thios happen from the WH opening? because where i am at i dont think WHs are up for more than say 2 or 3 minutes before they are found. but maybe we have a lot of exploration guys?
---
Absolutely.  
---
As long as Eve has been around, numbers and organization trump most other strategies. The basic design of the game reinforces this.  
---
The limiting factor is not game mechanics based, but just gets back the alliance’s ability to hold together large numbers...which is actually pretty hard to do.
---
Happy 10 years guys!
---
Guards are the Gallente sentry drone. They have the shortest range but best tracking. Faction guards have even better tracking. If you are going to use two separate ships you should have space for 2 tracking computers. That should give your sentries enough DPS to threaten an AF. You still need to hold it however, Which will be difficult if you can't scram it. Still, it's nice to see someone trying instead of just turtling in a station. If you have a friend you can see if they can bring a rapier, as that will let you easily get tackle on an AF, though it might just scare it off instead.
---
I just saw that I created my account in 2016, but probably should've taken the month into account :|
---
Seconded
---
I'm hardly upset. 
---
You're simply too retarded to have the conversation. 
---
😘

---
It's ok. I forgive you.
---
He in fact doesn't. 
---
See. He believes none of them bot. Its all only TEST. No one else bots only TEST. 
---
All rental empires quit years ago and never continued botting. 
---
You're also arguing with a retard. 
---
Who's played Eve for 4 months.
---
The fit in using is MWD scram fit. Unfortunately I have 0 points in sentry drones. I may try to see if I can get a web in there if I drop some neuts.
---
Man u really got us
---
Positioning and staging the heavy assets of the entire Imperium is a ponderous and time consuming thing.   Just when I think we can’t have any more Titans, supers and FAXs to move from 1DQ, they move another 3–4 more fleets.  Insanity.  
---
In the end, it’s much better to have all the things in place and ready to go.  
---
Hopefully once they are in position people will find entertaining things to do with them.
---
Did you stay in hisec or something? How frequently did you play?

Here's to hoping epic doesn't fuck it up

&gt; hopefully they stick around and frag some shit

  Good shit, hope to see them around
---
gamers rise up!!!

At least when you see a wreck with loot in a drone site you know you killed a faction spawn

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Ironic. Didn't Goons do the same thing during WWB?
---
I wasn't suggesting it as some gotcha on hunters just saying it's the most fair way.
---
DF found Adamantine and wanted to dig deeper...
---
If my maths is correct, playing 2 hrs per day over those 3 years...that comes out at an income level of almost 9000 isk per hr. Whats your secret?
---
I usually play every other day in all different kinds of security space. With a cap of 5 mil skill points with limited ships and modules its hard to make large amounts of isk.
---
Just seeing if anyone has experience with this. I have the weapons equipped, powered, and online. They are missing from the HUD and can't be selected using F keys.
---
I tried putting one of the invisible railguns offline but I can't put it back online now. In the hangar if I try to put it online it will briefly flash but then stay offline. I also can't unequip it. Logging off and back on does not solve the issue.
---
Dunno I wasn’t around in the casino war era.
---
Go for exploration...
---
ehhhhhhhhhhhhh lots of NCPL line members are just as dumb as GSF line members. Also they have a lot of ass to move, while you fellas don't.
---
Neither can you. Abyssals, fu, haha.
---
:thonking:
---
:D
---
Exploration, you only need a frigat worth 2-3 mil, and cam make hundreds of millions in the right area of NS. I'd recommend training cloaking, and don't get too attached to your ship.
---
Since you don't have rigs, just repackage your ship and then assemble it again. Then try fitting the modules again and see what happens.
---
If you want to make that in a day and are into PVE, join 'TDF-Official' ingame chat. It's an Incursion community - New Bro friendly. Just read the guides and see if you can fly one of the ships on the mailing list. And, you're good to go.
---
Recruit anyone with a pulse? ... Horde are recruiting my awox alts faster than i can biomass them and make more!
---
True
---
I mean I made 5.3 bn hauling stuff in astero from null to high sec in about 4 hours.....
---
I tried that and now only the first weapon is visible. Every other slot says 'empty x power slot'. The other weapons are visible on the ship and appear to track the targets but only the first one fires.
---
I hope he pulls through. Please send all our love to his family
---
Could be that your profile is corrupt. Close the EVE Client and in the launcher, hit the cogwheel next to your account name and select Manage Profiles. Create a new profile, name it and hit Close. After that's done, in the options window that you found with the cogwheel, select that profile you just created and launch the game again. All of your settings will reset to defaults, but we're doing this just to see if anything changes. If this fixes the problem, just remove the other profile that you used previously and rebuild your window layouts, overview settings and whatever using this new profile.
---
I assumed D2 meant Diablo II and thought it was a bit weird it's among all these modern games...
---
Destiny 2 really will never take the D2 mantle from Diablo in my mind
---
This is a very bad change, please reconsider. It will ruin the whole "sense of the unknown" in exploration, and help exploration bots to work better.
---
Thanks   men and thanks you for  been so great
---
My problem with eve is that I'm a casual normie playing eve... Am I ok?
---
Nobody's saying you should remove those. You absolutely need to get them, not even with 5 minute delay, which is the case, but you or your buddies need to be fucking LOGGED in order for that to happen.
---
Villy will use his charm to convince them to blue back. If not, well, TEST will still blue them.
---
So I tried this, got the starting cutscene and everything was reset. Still getting the same problem. It also happens in every ship I get in so it's a bit of an issue. I can only see one random module, in my venture I can see the second module of row 2 but nothing else.
---
Dwarves dug those tunnels and struck Eve. Praise the miners!
---
Protip: They did. Ran to lowsec after one major fight in M-0
---
Sounds like a plan!
---
Last time someone started joking about hands it didn't end well. Hands are serious business my friend.
---
Hoping for the best.
---
Then you need to open a support ticket. Hit F12 while in game and select the support ticket option. Be sure to take a screenshot of the issue with the ingame tool and if you want to save some time, mention that you already tried these troubleshooting steps in this thread so that the GM that responds to you won't ask you to do them again. 
---
Make sure that you do NOT report a bug in the F12 menu, even though this might sound like one. You won't get a response to a bug report and your problem won't get solved. Bug reports don't work that way.
---
Go back to the wow Reddit then
---
Where's the branch for dipshits like me that sub and don't play?
---
O7
---
All the best man, hope he's ok, that fkn sucks.
---
There is no way to patch it. But it's considered an exploit and is bannable.
---
IRL: Keep fighting, keep winning.
---
Eve: keep mining, keep losing.

---
Is it what my anus looks like?
---
Its also happening to me a lot.
---
See a need, fill a need..... and makes me iskies.   Fucking DUUUUURRRRRR!!!!
---
Thanks, I will try that.
---
I can't tell you. But it may be a good idea to add on what pirate faction you plan to run. They can wildly vary in DPS/tank need.
---
That's a very interesting emergent gameplay! Look how gsf shutdown any region before a war thanks to their "nsa" (cloaky group led by boat)
---
What is left of undocking PanFam surely doesn't need much logistics to move.
---
Keeping omega is much easier then earning it. Grab your self a procurer and mine like a mad man for 7 days, then sell up for a month of omega.
---
It's so far down the scale a single Jpeg cannot possibly hope to contain it.
---
Just to let you all know, the TDF armor incursion community will be looking to take part in this event. We've come up with some cheap basic no implant fits if you would like to join. We honestly have no idea how these sites are going to work but have read everything we can from the hoboleaks. We're very familiar with the Triglavian ships themselves as we use them all the time and have some expert abyssal site runners that fly with us. So we're prepared, we think the best we can be. 
---
You can find us in the chat channel   **TDF-Official**
---
You can also join our mailing list      **TDF-FITS TRIG1**
---
Please do not buy any ships or fittings atm. The mailing list as is, is just our initial thoughts on the fleet comp. As we wont know until the event goes live exactly whats needed.
---
Guy seems like a bit of a boss breaking out via a window after being shot.
---
Hope he pulls through and the idiot who shot him gets plenty of jail time.
---
POE - so many life spend there and still playing :p
---
a ping every 15 minutes. Are you a casual?
---
Well at least my dad can beat up your dad!
---
The best ship is Visa.
---
Oh, one last thing. While in game, (or in the character selection screen) hit Esc and go to the Reset Settings tab. Under Reset to Default you'll find an option to Clear All Cache Files. It will ask you to restart the game so just do that. This feature is known to fix the weirdest issues, but if it doesn't fix yours, just submit the support ticket as I mentioned above.
---
Yeah that was the first thing I tried, looked promising but no luck.
---
Fuckin love me some sólstafir. I honestly did think you would link Fjara though.
---
Dust wasn't on pc because ccp thought they could capture an untapped audience.
---
oh boi, PANFAM is fucked now
---
Where’s factorio?
---
What is this a screenshot of?
---
Happy birthday you crazy buggers.
---
what is the problem with a afk ship in local?
---
"Null should have risk just not to me."
---
Well we will just have to remember this for next time, you couldn't find 30 mins to apply so you'll easily be able to find time to do all the work that being on the CSM requires. 
---
You have my vote next time. /s
---
It's very sad, totally breaks the game for me. I guess it must have happened while I was messing around with fittings somehow. I noticed I was having trouble bringing modules online, they would just flash quickly but not come online.
---
Quite ironic when you think about how much free intel killboards provide to the game.
---
It's Planetside 2
---
Depends what you want. The profit tracking is very useful, aling with the related history. The SP module gets clunky after 100 toons, but most things do tbh. Jeronica is 100% legit and you dont have to worry about your masterful trade ideas taken.
---
remove zkillboard first, it says too much intel
---
Goons are waiting for the wow classic release in hopes that Kilahbee will play it for some time...
---
Oh yeah, more context would have been better.  Planetside was/is a game that was basically a mix between battlefield and halo. It was made by Sony and put on the PS4 and PC. It handles large groups of players... moderately well and would have been perfect for procedurally generated Dust maps. That is a screenshot of a kill I got, where I stabbed a guy from the back of my Harasser&lt;Halo Warthog analog&gt; with the Mittani (PBUH) knife.
---
I take personal offense with Borderlands placing.
---
Not even THE KALEVALA EXPANSE Maps are linked, keep up or you could never become a real spy...
---
If doing for example some DED 5/10 and the site doesn't mention what rats trigger the next way, is thete some good rule of thumb on what rats to kill first and what rats to kill later?
---
Also, does the same logic apply to missions as for the DED sites and ratting.
---
Thanks. O7
---
That's.... not the pole I was expecting
---
What is with all the future tense in this post? They blue up before the other side even comes on TQ now right?
---
Any comp with cap transfer logi a
---
Fully agree. I played most of these games, and even as someone who had 100% progression raid attendance in WoW for TWO YEARS I must admit EvE is too big a commitment for me. I created an account in 2010 and kept those skills training but don’t even have 100 hours played. Waiting for that early retirement plan to work out so I can devote the time and attention it deserves.
---
This is what I imagine it's like being in the Sebiestor Tribe
---
In that scenario MBC would become the Imperium 2.0. That’s boring, so Panfam instead just started shooting people for fun. It didn’t work out in the long run metagame because it wasn’t supposed to.
---
if you go with lasers on a ship not bonused towards laser cap usage, use elutriation rigs.
---
Farming Simulator 2019 ?
---
That face when both Imperium and Panfam band together during times of war to stomp a shitpost on reddit.
---
Unless you like shooting abandoned structures they won't see much combat. No one will fight them.
---
And now so does NC/PL
---
Max all the charisma risma skills first.
---
that's a good vid :)
---
Yes they should undock against the largest titan and super fleet in the game, against the largest coalition.
---
i think you mean preparing to flood the whole cavern with magma.
---
i recon in order it would be something like   
---
Diablo 2  
---
Dune 2   
---
Destiny 2
---
Time will tell I expect.  
---
You never know when something interesting may happen on our little field trip around the map.  I am more than happy to move my Titans around just in case a little excitement happen.
---
What would they do with more titans?
---
What they need is more people. But they don't want more people to the extent it would be needed to contest goons, so they don't.
---
Let them play how they want, mate.
---
you are trying hard to make a narrative about TAPI. While trying to stress that FRT treasury are only FRT renters and so not FRT fault, yet XiX (renters) who is not even TAPI renters, is somehow TAPIs fault. Yet you havent even wondered whose renter BoT is. BS
---
T1 battleships are produced using BPO that are seeded by NPC.
---
navy BS need to use faction LP store.
---
pirate BS need faction LP store or BPC drop from loot
---
Which one does the leshak go into ?
---
It's technically a T1 BS, but its gimmick ramp-up and its acquisition make it go in the "pirate" class. What prevents it from being a "pirate" is that it needs one faction skill (precursor) instead of two like all other pirate ships.
---
It can't go into "special edition ships" because its acquisition is not limited per player, like eg the gnosis or the marshall.
---
You are saying a tomato and a Ferrari should have the same speed because they have the same color.
---
If the question is: is eve-mogul a scam? Then no, Eve-mogul is legit and trustworthy.
---
If you ask if it's worth a subscription. Then there is only one way to find out if it suits you. Try it!
---
Because FRAT and Goons krab like fuckers and recruit anyone while NC and others don't want to play the meta game "doing nothing for 2 years but 1month deployement every 6 months to swing the super fleet in front of everyone". (I know Goons have pretty active SIGs but that's not the case for a majority).
---
Neither Goons or FRAT are paying titans for their membres, they just provide the environnent to get it. As much trash you can throw at NC and PL, not wanting to krabs as much as possible is not what I would throw at them.
---
1) No Rorquals were harmed in the making of this film.
---
2) Inspiring video, nice work.
---
this is not correct. February you get at least one day more than that, usually two.
---
DBG and Sony have fucked Planetside 2 way more than what you can imagine. This game use to have such a strong core of medium sized groups with good leaders and they are all gone now because nobody listened.
---
Does it ring a bell to you ?
---
F
---
What's a good place near dodixie to scan in ns?
---
&gt;where is all this isk NC.
---
in the wallets of a couple dozen people to allow them to play the game the way they want
---
That's what Horde do.  I don't think Horde see themselves as master baiters of EvE.
---
I had someone in Horde yelling at me for taking a 1.5 bill Onyx to a fight and getting it blown up and I said "that's what Horde do.  
---
Then I said, "if I wanted to be gud and win every fight with cookie cutter fits that work I would have joined Goons"
---
That shut them up.  Then I got another Onyx.
---
Much deeper, but we currently don't have the technology to display it on a conventional screen.
---
TAPIs favorite color?
---
ah? Who can answer it?
---
Only threat to capsuleers are concord because they can sever the connection between us and our ships. Doubt that trig Titan tanks 500 dds. If it does Id love to see the lore for that.
---
&gt;Which is the definition of a strawman and not good discussion etiquette.
---
On the opposite, YOU are making a strawman.
---
He's giving an example of what we don't want. Of a potential problematic issue, with an extreme case to make sure your limited you gets it.
---
And you don't get it, instead you are making him say false things, eg
---
&gt; If you can show me a T1 battleship that when gaining a 12-20% increase  in EHP puts it into capital levels of EHP (after the capital fits a  tank), go for it.
---
This is completely stupid, he never affirmed there was such a BS because as he said THE GOAL IS TO AVOID THIS. You are either a complete retard or avoiding his point on purpose, which makes you an hypocritical douche.
---
Everybody uses simple words to explain you why you are wrong, and yet you fail to understand those simple words everytime.
---
so here is the thing in fewer words yet : 
---
BALANCE != RAW HP BALANCE
---
I would say PVE is better than it's ever been in Eve. The new sites are much less boring. And I would say they are worthwhile for the isk. But since you should play the game to have fun and not to "work", the isk is decent enough for sure, even if it might be a bit lower.
---
Of course, the PVE is still not perfectly untertaining, but CCP is making great advancements. And with this weeks expansion, I hope we will get a fun and entertaining incursion level PVE
---
And in this game, people are affirming their biased opinion, based on their limited experience,  is the only good way to make balance.
---
Didn't want to play the game anyway eh
---
A toast to 10 another years!
---
Or Paradox games
---
Sorry but the mistake they made was going console.
---
My biggest gripe with EvE or CCP is that they gave in with walking in stations.
---
Well, since there are not really helpful comments, I try to give a helpful one.
---
Usually wars are not from 0-100 within days. Often something like that is tried, but it usually does not work out to force a decisive battle right in the beginning.
---
Then, the long game starts. And the pace slows down for 1-2 weeks. This very often caused by market effects. Both sides start lose ships, change stagings and introduce new doctrines. This means the war LOGISTICS is overheated alot. (For example: currently harpies are at 50-70million per ship, they used to be below 35million in jita) Until the markets have adjusted to this new demand, there simply cannot welp that many fleets, as there are simply not enough ships available in all of eve.
---
The second stage is the actual advancement. Currently, with the strong cyno jammers, the defenders have a great advantage. And also, the defenders are as hyped as the attackers, so the numbers are as high. With constant pressure, the ability to earn isk, is usually decreased by alot. Which over the time of weeks, will force the first players to earn isk somehow else. Which causes a pressure on the fleet numbers, etc.
---
All in all, you can expect that a war has to warm up for a month at least, to see how it develops. 10 Days, is nothing for an eve war. Most players are not even fully set up at the front after 10 days..
---
Cm
---
,
---
Eve will limp on for years as a PVE oriented WoW clone in space, and the more the population drops the more micro-transactions they'll introduce, and the more staff they'll cut. The money they wring out of Eve will continue to be dumped into other projects as they hope and pray for some of the shit they throw at the wall to stick.
---
Well TEST  enjoy it now cuz if north is not a thing you are next
---
Of the lsrge alliance nc. Definitely have most titans per character
---
Compelling argument, sir.
---
I'll always have a special place in my heart for TDSIN bros. Fanfest was an epic experience for me, lots of good memories and funny fucked up stories for round the camp fire!
---
Congrats boys.
---
Who the fuck are you?  Some monkey with 20 reddit accounts.  Piss off.
---
The project received substantial Sony funding. It was a "console or nothing" situation.
---
well, that spin is dead mate. The botting statistics are now public and well. FRT won that one, by far
---
What do you mean "where is all the isk"? The isk is in the hands of the people at the top, where it's always been. There's nothing "wrong" there. NC doesn't give out titans. No one does. Don't be a dumbass.
---
The "moron of the day" award has already been issued to CanumFerox, but there's some late competition coming through from this OP!
---
Then they had to go and hold up the Palestine flag like a bunch of idiots
---
I have sent you a pm
---
Eyo someone get my boi here a shaker for all his salt
---
Poor little goonies moved 1300 titans to a piece of empty space and now so sad that no one is there to fight them.
---
Have fun with the moveop home!
---
Instead of logarithmic damage cap, make the dmg cap activated actively. So a specific module, that activates the dmg cap. Defenders would need to be present with at least 1 ship to activate the dmg cap. 
---
So it would be either a fast kill, or there is always some ship to be killed
---
Or, he is new as he said and didn't consider that.
---
You are aware you can see all jumpgates directly on the ingame map, right ?
---
We will. After we shit all over ur stuff.
---
Respect to you sir, have an upvote!
---
Have you tried to verify your shared cache?

Thats the first thing to do when encountering strange issues as there often is just a corrupt file somewhere causing issues.

---
Dust 514 would have killed EvE with its glorious searing light of overwhelming success if it were allowed to be on PC.
---
This is a well told story.  I applaud the smart editing and choice of content.  Was very informative and engaging to watch.  This is worth anybody's time to watch.  Well done.
---
If I was to have an issue.  It is the sad fact that players are more and more being pushed into (or coerced into) having more accounts instead of actually teaming up with friends and corp mates to delages the roles needed to fulfill whatever the objective is.  Instead, multi boxing x number of accounts has become the iWin button of Eve.  This is not to say that multi boxing is not a skill or a valid playstyle.  But I sure wish it was not the case.
---
Nevertheless.  The points in the video are good and well made.  I will be casting one of my (how many fucking votes do we have to cast now?) my vote for you in the next CSM
---
Make that 21 accounts and you should really calm down and drink a nice tall glass of shut the fuck up.
---
but how?
---
you are blessed doing structure bashing. you krabbed years to bash structures... i'm proud of you and rly its a shame i cant do this!
---
Is that because their krabing toons are in goons?
---
And Pi is exactly 3!
---
Congrats!
---
I think plantside 2 is more active than it has been in a very very long battle...  on cobalt at least, there’s at least 3-4 battles that are in the hundreds..
---
That really sucks man. Hope he pulls through. Make sure you take care of yourself too.
---
Then why do they project 'ownership' over the most regions in the game?
---
Too bad structures have damage cap, with 1300 titans it’s still gonna take the same amount of time 😂
---
Tbf Abyssal Sites are awesome. Done in Cruiser hulls and teirs 1-5 and they are decent money.
---
3 rooms, random spawns, 20 minute time limit. 
---
If you run out of time you lose ship and pod if you die you lose pod as well soi make sure you are in a clean clone!
---
This narrative is getting stale as shit - we were kicked out of our home, moved to Delve, and built up from ZERO over 2 years time. How the fuck did anyone let this happen? Too focused on dank fragging sad brained afk rorquals I guess.
---
Are you telling me you sacrifice children to Bob?  And if you are, does it work?
---
Fairly certain there is an obvious answer to this question. Line members never see the money of a rental empire.
---
It's the best pocket in curse :D
---
Yes.
---
There's something to be said for that system that has a couple of L4 Serp agents, because Serp LP &gt; Angel LP (personally I think people undervalue Halo implants but that's just me), but the real money in Pirate missions doesn't come from the LP anyway.
---
I knew a small alliance once. It was called Goonswarm. Some big unbeatable alliance was beating down on them because they could. 
---
Never give up. Never give in. Never stop trying.
---
Mmmm, you did the training agents didn't you?
---
Map editors. Yep. Still spending hours coding levels for Warcraft 3 I then play for less hours.
---
Goonswarm, small alliance. Lol
---
One, you will be a cog in the machine as long as you willingly be so. You gotta step forward to be counted. 
---
And two, you need to get into a ship undock and fly into battle. You don't need a specific ship or even a big ship to do this. Just do it.
---
They did, they lost a Keepstar.
---
Currently most of the war effort is focused on logistics. Setting up always takes time no matter how big the attacker is.
---
The war was announced 1 week ago and moveops began right after. So for the first 2-4 days you wont see any serious action since most of the manpower is focused on moveops.
---
This calmed down the last few days and what you see now is harassment fleets and infrastructure of the attackers going up. This is not just the Keepstar in KQK but everything down to people sorting cyno chains for the jfs. 
---
I would expect to see the first serious bigger timers once this is done wich i feel like will take up momentum over the next week and weekend.
---
They are a superpower, and for the longest time they were the main superpower. I dont think the reality has fully caught up with them yet.  
---
That and they have this whole persona of the true Good guys of eve.  I myself even used to admire them.
---
Because why would they not if nobody strong enough can contest it ?
---
Yeah because they just released a big patch ...
---
They may never just be given flat isk, but the isk should be put towards the alliance. Ie citadels to build, research, reprocess, etc and to project power. SRP. Just general stuff to help the alliance.
---
I did all this.
---
It would severely hurt new/casual players, and the gain won't amount to much is the reasoning behind it I think
---
Panfam wouldnt dare invade test. Remember last time the PL superfleet entered test space?
---
Gotta say, i had fun bombing those mining fleets. Always a few people who think a covetor is a good idea haha
---
Forever ago they were very small. Only allowing members from something awful.com. Iirc it wasnt until goonsswarm allied with Red Alliance to retake their space from Southern Coaliton that they became powerful ish and even then they were beat by BOB
---
This is known. OP just asked such a silly question it deserved a silly answer. Your logic being both perfect and correct has no place in this thread.
---
Currently Fraternity has a station monopoly on the L4 serp agent (Theres a dude in 2-3 tornados on the undock at all times from AUTZ to early EUTZ).
---
Halo implants are nice to try and sig-tank but outside of small ganging, there aren't of any use. I'm stocking up on Angel LP right now for the Savior implants.
---
&gt;but the real money in Pirate missions doesn't come from the LP anyway.
---
Can you elaborate further? I don't do anything but burners for specifically the LP....
---

A+ Olmeca, RnK would be proud.

---
you could be in nullsec flying a tackle frig helping kill caps with your first 500k SP, don't let highsec dictate your play style.
---
If youre me, than who am I?
---
Poke me in discord @glorfindeil#2642 and I will guide you through and answer all your questions
---
This is the equivalent of why the mmo genre started to die as a whole when Wiki's made the game all about googling and watching YouTube videos rather than actually learning by figuring things out and working with others.
---
This move puts EVE one notch to the side of "casual" on the bar.
---
he parrots the horde corp propaganda line awful perfectly for a new bro.
---
It happened because wwb ended. Only the rest of nullsec combined has the number of irl people required to contest the Imperium's numbers. There's no real way to kill an alliance in this game if it's players are still active and want to log in, what you need to kill is their willingness to play. That would have required all of the MBC to chase the Imperium back and two around null kicking over their sandcastles for a long time whilst getting relatively little content.
---
 The moment they moved to delve they built their fortress and turbocrabbed to build up an incontestable supercapital fleet to defend it. So that's what they now have, an incontestable supercapital fleet that's only good for home defence as it's too large for any one group to face.
---
Doesn’t need to be on there- if you start rimming you will never stop to browse Reddit and see this anyway.
---
Well in the current state of eve. NC. Isnt the biggest power anymore, but its hard to say which side truly is the more powerful. Neither side will commit 100% to a fight.
---
Is there any way to refine zkillboard searches? Say only show x ships used in lowsec between y-z timezones?
---
&gt; Null is about sandbox, it's the Unlimited class of Eve play. You want to take on null sec groups that are skilled and organized you are going to have to put some skill and work into organizing yourself
---
You shouldn't have to have an entire capital fleet on standby to tackle a cruiser in nullsec. The threat of a cyno kills content, because you can't engage in a fight without a threat of capitals dropping instantly, uncounterably, right on top of you.
---
Biomass V
---
If sp is a barrier to what you want find some smaller groups with less narrow minds, sp isn't that big a deal
---
Is it tho? Beyond "CCP said so" is there any evidence for that?
---
It uses special materials to build. It uses a BPC that can only be acquired from special PVE areas, it better than T1 stats, and it's a non-standard race.
---
&gt; In null... are you really going to ping D scan the whole time to get a partial view of who’s there at any given time? That’s going to be tiresome.
---
That's exactly what people do in wormholes and it's not that tiresome.
---
There are plenty of corps who will take on newer players and help guide them through. Drop me a message on discord if you like I'll help out. Ross#5774

I've finally torn myself away from that dark, dark hole.

Have you posted a resume anywhere? Are you watching recurrent channels?

Have you just fit a ship and flown into some random ass shit and been like "hey can I rep you?
---
You sit in a station THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, no one is going to gently guide your lazy ass to where you want  to be, undock and go get blown up.
---
JFC you sound like a whiny, lazy, entitled leach. You want a job, go expose youself, I got invited to 3 low-sec groups just going at whatever I saw in T1 frigs and cruisers.

BLAH BLAH BLAH, fly bitch.

*Gotta find a new weird pvp fit to surprise people*
---
I’ve never heard of it but there’s lots of undiscovered niche frig abyss fits out there. Why don’t you fit one up and tell us how it goes?
---
The "correct" response for if you have just one toon is to just pay for plex. Get a job part time if you're unemployed, just a few hours a week, and you will have enough for years to come.
---
But this isn't "in game" and I understand that, so you're left with, really:
---
* C5 dread krabbing 
---
* C6 dread krabbing (you probably want to multibox and or have friends for this)
---
* Become a PVP god and farm loot from the wreckages of other players in abyssal pvp (requires high skill and high capital for bling fits)
---
the rest involve capitals and null sec.
---
Plex is just dumb expensive now, and the activities in game haven't really scaled that well for one player.
---
Other than that you will need to get inventive, noone is going to tell you their secret niches.
---
Takes a little over an hour to plex one account in C5/C6.
---
I have a full time job lol and also have a house to pay for and upkeep. So in game Usk is my 9nly real way atm to plex
---
Get a toon into a null corp, buy 10/10 DEDs = Profit 
---
i'm doing 5 a day and it's enough to plex my 3 Accounts every Month + pew pew
---
Eh, I find LP more reliable. And like I said, I do burner blitzing only.
---
Both sides fully commited in X47
---
can you take overtime? probably better to spend 2 extra hours grinding IRL as opposed to 4 in game, and then spend the remaining 2 having fun in game

Please visit *TDSIN Recruitment* in-game to speak to our recruiters
---
Well a war is when two sides fight. This is shenanigans
---
Uuuurh it's pretty obvious which side is the strongest right now.
---
The answer is obvious RMT. The leadership of NC have been milking for years like other renters in the droneland are infamous for previous.
---
For anyone thinking about ISK farming via abyssal PVP - just don't. It is the worst idea I have ever heard. Besides capital null ratting maybe.
---
Yeah 10000 hours of structure bashing , worth moving , prob. Cheaper to deploy some on an alt Corp in delve and kill them , at least u don’t need to feed 1000b of ratting ships in the meantime
---
If panfam as a whole entered TEST space, TEST would get shit on without goon intervention.
---
But I think he meant that goon would come, not Panfam.
---
Where is Csgo?
---
it's kind of a meme, but hey if you can ezclap your way to to the top of the [abyssal elo ranking board](http://www.abyssaldata.com/) you can sure pull out some [shiny loot](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76433271/)... just check the kills

---
Says the dude wishing someone was aborted 😂
---
Not at all and the set up is far from easy.
---
Easiest set up would be to farm T5 abyssal. No other account needed, maybe 2/3 bil fit and pod investment, no need to coordinate with others.
---
Thanks!
---
It's daily server restart at 11:00 UTC
---
Logi and ECM for fighters.
---
Citadels are an amazing force multiplier but you need a force in the first place.
---
The best this guy can hope for is undocking at the last second and getting the killing blow.
---
More importantly wtf is that fit
---
You're playing Eve online, not Wow. You can't expect to play as logi all the time. It just not how Eve is. You will have to be pro active, join an alliance and fly what new comers are suppose to fly, ewar and tackle.
---
Get the SP so that you can fly most ships with metaguns  and then work toward T2 cruisers for logi fleet.
---
You can completly enjoy the game as a new player.
---
Abyss, Incursions, Anomalies/DED sites, relic/data hunting, Industry...... there are so many ways to make enough plex to omega your account they can’t all be listed.
---
If you check out the EVE Down Under VOD I did a presentation showing an alpha making the required isk to omega an account in ~55hrs from starting with only 50m and no ships.
---
I took my time and did it slow. I’m sure anyone could do it even faster than I.
---
Whats the chances of loosing that ship in site?
---
The ISK is good enough?
---
Do people still do incursions I'm sure since SSN collapsed no one did them
---
Your reading comprehension is poor. Try again. He didn’t break out of a window lol.
---
The isk is good enough, you can reach easily 150mil+ per hour with nice bonuses.
---
Loosing the ship is possible, but you should try out T3 and T4 before. Make sure you read guides.
---
Only half of the superfleets were present, the other half was flooding in when the node crashed.
---
Imperium will not likely invade Legacy space.
---
Point being if the north disappear.
---
There are various groups including armour groups, a few Russian ones and Warp To Me are still very active and a great community to fly with.
---
My average wait list time was 10mins
---
This is true, but it's easier to use a map like this.
---
Fuckin awesome. ура ))
---
Over longer timescales, those rich massive coalitions invariably fall apart. It's happened at least 9 or 10 times while I've been playing.
---
Eve uni... Come out to nsc
---
Sounds great thanks!
---
It's so nice looking.
---
That was UALX
---
o7 thoughts and prayers
---
The only reason I still login to SC2 is to play Undead Assault Chronicles. Still play a couple dozen matches a month and the community is still decent.
---
This sounds hilarious.
---
Filthy Vanu Scum.
---
Huh? Eve is a sandbox game, he can do whatever the fuck he wants and who said newcomers can’t fly Logi, unless we’re talking about strat ops...
---
preach brother, you can't spell goonswarm federation without 'good fite'
---
You're going to have a hard time loging in any other situation. Especially in large alliances
---
The more you do it, the more preparation is required. Optimistically speaking preparation can be less than 15-20 minutes for a few hours of farming and requires only two accounts and the initial setup.
---
Taking it further and not limiting yourself to available anoms in one system increases preparation exponentially to the point where you're probably only making 500m-1b/hour.
---
Out of all the non-creative ways, the only other thing worth doing  is Rorq mining because it's semi-afk and requires little interaction.
---
I really hope so as I am a new player and I really dislike the current state of the game, currently planning on going for a smaller Corp too...
---
Just out of curiosity if you can recall, normally what is the reason for large power blocs falling apart? If you mind could you give me some examples. I find Eve history rather interesting from a player’s point of view..
---
As a PvPer even if I’ve been somewhat inactive for a while I’m sending you 1st place ballot on all 30 of my votes. I may not have always seen eye to eye with you on reddit, but it’s pretty clear you have the same interests as me and the group of players I’ve been in a community with for a long time now.
---
PS- Your lifestyle is a bit more viable for the “normal” player in WH Space as we have the farmholes with krabs that even the slightly higher averaged player can manage to log off and kill their dreads, but killing dreads is much less exciting than delve pest control. Other changes to the game have slowly choked off and killed parts of Wormholes since 2013 or so and I’d love to illustrate some of those issues to you; ultimately this has resulted in much less content being available in wormholes.
---
Not necessarily tho, if you Logi on roam fleets or in standing fleet, I don’t think that would be a problem at all.. For example in Brave we normally run ospreys, it has next to no requirements and pretty much always needed..
---
Pvp God, not really.. In Brave we have far from that, fuckers always have a salvager on their ship and ninja loot the fuck out of every wreck lol
---
They set the rules of that sandbox you know. It's like if a bunch of people took their dogs into a sandpit and the dogs all shat in it. The play experience for the kids in that sandpit would probably degrade quite a bit. Just because something is  a "sandbox" doesn't mean it should be left alone because we end up with this situation we're discussing here.
---
Everyday, if it's not patch Tuesday and things are going well it will be less than 10 minutes like it was today. They say 15 minutes to be on the safe side.
---
Yes but that's content that is very dependant on people coming for content to you
---
It makes sense. It looks like this game is different. What region do you recomnend?
---
Skill urself has more
---
If you want to both make decent isk while PVPing, off the top of my head:
---
\- try roaming low sec in a gank-fit T3D that can achieve 600+ dps. Make NPC mining haulers visible on d-scan. Whenever you detect a T1 NPC hauler on d-scan (Iteron, Bestower etc), use the "align camera" trick to quickly find out which asteroid belt it's at. Alternatively, you can use combat probes to find haulers. Quickly scram, gank, loot and GTFO before NPC response fleet arrives. They drop loot boxes worth about 40m. You can usually find 3-5 per hour. Since you're PVP-fitted, you can blap anyone fitting your engagement profile as well. Estimated isk/hr: 150m.
---
\- pirate hacker. Since you're a wormholer, you're probably aware of this method. Fly an Astero or combat-fitted cov-ops, and gank fellow explorers while hacking relic and data sites. Estimated isk/hr: 100m-150m. 
---
\- pirate huffer. This method is more niche. Check [fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/gas.html](https://fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/gas.html) for the richest gas in low sec. Fly a combat-fitted Prospect and look for gas sites in the richest region, since it'll attract gas huffers from all of New Eden. Ganking a fully-laden Prospect with the richest gas can net you 250m in loot ( **Azure Cytoserocin)**, although in reality it'll probably be less. If you find a rich gas site that no-one's huffing, you can refit for huffing and claim the gas yourself. Estimated isk/hr: 50m-150m.
---
You’re a cunt. That isn’t going to change. You have to put in the effort in the large coalitions to get anywhere and working inside small groups within them is tons of fun.
---
Roaming fleets tho, and I don’t mean roaming in our own space.. 
---
Also I don’t know how it is around your home system but in Catch, people always come down for a good fight..
---
They won't add gambling. There already was EVE gambling, they didn't remove it due to the RMT they removed it due to fear of new anti gambling regulations.
---
Yes because you're un Brave. That's not really the case for other alliance except maybe Horde.
---
It don't have to be gambling game. I just gave an example.
---
you didn't look hard enough
---
This is prety much accurate only this time they brought their rabid dogs, we are left with just pitchforks :(
---
Happy birthday Joe &amp; Exookiz, great showing!
---
TO WAR WITH TRIGLAVE WE GO, READY THE BANNERS!
---
Be wary of any website that takes your ESI credentials. Most likely, you are being tracked, for counterintelligence or market-related reasons.
---
Welcome to decade old ideas.
---
lol no.
---
Didn't I tell you to piss off?
---
And a bit under eve lies Factorio... discrete but deadly
---
Well, that's how WE do things. Other alliances sometimes, uh, don't stick the landing.
---
Tuesday coming it might be longer just because of the expansion but usually I can log in 10 mins later
---
Happy birthday. WHBOO!
---
It was only tied to console exclusivity for 1 year. I played Dust on PC. The internal beta was on PC.
---
Indeed lol
---
The only thing to ever change is you. There is no right way to play a EvE, there is only a right way for you. 
---
If you want to be a logi-god, go find a small PvP group and be their single Logi. You obviously shouldn't joint a power bloc. Be precise about what you want, even if you are unsure, for in chasing the dream you will discover the truth. 
---
I only do lowsec and NPC null. I only do small organizations where I can be a big player. I focus a lot on new pilots or those who haven't yet decided what Eve is about -- they can bring an energy and openness which vets struggle to find. 
---
Inside that pocket I have made pirate corps, PvP tryhard corps, new player training Corps, and my current venture. I search follow my interest, ignore my doubt, and have done things in EvE which could never happen anywhere else. Each trip refines and corrects my interest, no step is misplaced, the wandering and wondering is required for the journey.
---
Hook, line and sinker
---
I'm coming up on [14 years](http://eveboard.com/global/pilot/LinuxEater). Sunk cost fallacy is real for me, ahaha. Seriously though. We're all here because of EVE's unique gameplay and community. We really only have community right now. :\ Everything else is blobs. Blobs on blobs on timers on blobs.
---
Huh. Shower/desk thought: My character would be starting high school. REPUBLIC MILITARY ACADEMY HERE WE COME!
---
Stuff that will be abandoned after a week.
---
150mil an hour is absolute ass for risking a 3b+ ship. Running high sec burners for even the absolute worst LP stores will yield more isk/hour than that.
---
I never really got the whole "they don't want to perform indiscriminate recruiting" bit. Do people who say this forget that Pandemic Horde exists? The North has a wholly subservient untouchables class that they can use to acquire the numbers needed to be relevant in nullsec without tarnishing their elite caste. Recruitment should be easy; they can dangle the carrot of promotion to a higher caste endlessly over the hoi polloi. Between that, and recruiting on a platform of "we're not Goonswarm Federation," you'd think it'd be a slam dunk.
---
Best book I ever played.
---
Anoikis obviously, but if you want to deal with k-space look at the map, go through the filters, find something interesting going on and talk to the people there.
---
Look up Spectre Fleet, join Eve Uni, park yourself on a lowsec gate and talk to the first person that shoots you.
---
Unless you're into mega corp sandcastle kicking, any group that's going to care about small logi ships is going to move around, small logi covers small gangs, the whole point of small gangs is that they can move around and can take wormholes in mass.
---
You should also have seen pop up notices about the cluster shutting down.  That means finish up what you are doing and dock up.
---
It's up to you to interact. No one will just throw random advice at you, ask questions, do things. Even if it's a dumb question and a dumb thing.
---
Eve online is not world of wellfare or fortnoob if you show no investment people won't give you any, I start 4 years ago eve online and join an English speaking corp as a french I had to learn eve and English was spending half of my day reading guide etc and my corp mate helped me to understand the big line. People won't grab your hand and show the world like I said this is not wow
---
Did you know they were a time where goonswarm was a renter for oos?
---
Let people gamble their ships and I'm in.
---
&gt;First idea was to add some casino games into stations like interstellar poker or roulette
---
Eve had a Casino in station in its beta.  Well it had a button for it, but it was never implemented.  Given the legal situation over gambling in games, it is very, very unlikely to ever be done.
---
Gsf have logi doctrine for alpha pilot t1 logi that are 100% srp in stratops and always welcome
---
You live in a wh? Please say you're doing PI on all characters on an account in the hole.
---
Incursions are still a 90-120mil an hour thing with pretty minimal skills needed compared to payout, so I'm pretty sure that people will be running them for years to come. Warp To Me is still very active. You're pretty much guaranteed to be able to PLEX if you run them for 20 hours a month. They sometimes don't allow multi-box, but if they do, you're guaranteeing to be able to PLEX however many accounts you can multi-box.
---
Of course but I have to stuck them on longer cycles as I can't be active every day
---
As a newer player myself, all i can tell you is you need to use mumble and discord. Rarely people talking in game because they using mumble and all info you need to know such as ping, doctrine ships, newbie advice, upcoming fleets etc is all in discord.
---
Join the chat Channel SF Spectre Fleet. They do public roams and can get you involved and get you some experience.
---
They have daily roams and Logi is almost always SRPed( if you die they will pay for you ship). Although ask the FC to make sure. 
---
If you are a logi pilot especially just ask questions about what to do and they'll usually be more than happy to help (everyone has bad mood days though).
---
 its a good community people are more than happy to help with any questions.
---
Eve isnt a game where shit is handed to you on a plate, if they said they'd assign you a mentor fucking ask about it. They have 100s of members sometimes people fall through the cracks.
---
That said, yeh joining a massive corp isnt always the best option for a new player. 
---
Maybe try finding a smaller corp in Pandemic Horde or just anywhere really.
---
Once you wrap your head around, 'I am in charge of my own content', come to Provi. Small and midsize gangs, plenty of solo. Fairly laid back.
---
It's a known bug, you need to equip the weapon shown on the fitting window to the slot that's ghosting to be able to fix
---
bob fall because a director backstab them because they were a bunch of dicks  
---
Goons "died" during wwb or casino war because they were fat and lazy while their enemies were all bloody thirty and fed by casino 
---
Panfam fall appart after ccp change the meta from afk isk generating to "active" pve 
---
And so on.. it's usually either meta change or coalition who become too fat and too lazy and simulate a Rome 2.0
---
If you like eve history dig into eve empire books
---
Depends on the group like the active null static groups it will be 0 seconds as they roll a region hunter jumps and they go for the kill, the non-null static groups it can be 0 to 16 hours, but that often depends more on it being just a frig hole etc, as well you get them in your chain randomly the secondary don't have so many discovery issues's given it's rare for explorers to map holes above C4 very deep.
---
The null static groups are where the minute rule comes from the hole opens as the hunter jumps in ( because of wormhole mechanics ), like if they don't have anything juicy by 1 maybe 2 minutes there rolling that hole off looking for a new one.
---
The majority of the time even on 8-hour old holes like most null groups, like the whole we scan every hole already really doesn't happen in null blocs there might be some theoretical system in place but meh people are lazy. 
---
like the groups with the high explorer ratios: I'm thinking brave and horde both more often than not fail to map wormholes, now sure a hole inside of staging directly is not gonna last long but generally the holes are like slightly of the grid, to places where people don't travel that often, I have yet to see a region where people consistently discover wormholes quickly.
---
I mean gambling is probably bad example. My bad, my point was not gambling only. It was just first example which i had in my mind
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
I've been in goons for over 2 years and I have no clue why we do most of the things we do.
---
At the end it looks like most of it is because of memes and reasons.
---
o7 light the cyno, will send FAX his way

It sounds to me like you have a particular style if play in mind with a particular desired outcome and would like CCP to rearrange the game to accommodate.  That is not how a sandbox works.
---
Hi, yes, hello. Are you familiar with CCP, at all? Have you seen all their failed products over the years?
---
I think they finally wised up and saw that their only product *is* Eve Online. All the other stuff failed and even Dust wasn't what they set out to do (FPS in player-owned planetary structures).
---
Fake edit: nvm, they didn't learn - totally forgot about that wave-based PvE shooter against zombies that is being developed. cant wait to not play that either.
---
If CCP will do implement it in proper way then no. People will play these minigames if they will like them.
---
In Witcher 3 people played Gwent becouse they liked it, not becouse they had to
---
Hmm I'll have to check it out again.
---
It's be cool if the server had a dif downtime.
---
So you could do it when DT hits
---
Theres having them, then theres using them. but none will commit without there being virtually no risk of loss, so none commit
---
It's a good thing you pay for the service.
---
As a poe player It seems pretty legit to me :)
---
&gt;larger alliances
---
skill u is 1k dudes
---
Really? Even for the alpha hyperion?
---
He will pull through.
---
They're different games for different people. The unit AI in BW would drive me insane.
---
paranoid much lol?
---
Even goons, as an example, say they’re the good guys from their point of view. Who doesn’t say that about their own group?
---
Both diablo 2 and destiny 2 work so either one
---
Pretty certain he is just speaking from experience of the tools created by Goonswarm that request your ESI and what they are used for.
---
It’s over — the supercomputer is being repacked for WoW classic.
---
&gt; so I can devote the time and attention it deserves
---
it deserves nothing. It's a video game..
---
I see, I wasn’t very familiar with the state of other systems, I was in goons for a few weeks and I remember getting ganked a whole lot but nobody would really take on proper fights..
---
Congrats on your *Certified Bad Poster* reddit award
---
Thanks for taking the time to post this... Which Eve books you’d recommend?
---
Join a smaller pirate/FW corp in lowsec, it's all about smaller ships there. You won't regret it, look at StayFrosty, they accept everyone are very welcoming and teach you how to survive and do things by yourself.
---
Ambulation is called. They want their 2011 ideas back.
---
\&gt; As I mentioned these activities would not require any kind of extra 3d models (so it would require much less work from ccp to introduce it) as they would be handled inside extra window like the discovery project or the agency. 
---
Spoken like someone who has never done development. ;D
---
Don't take this the wrong way. EVE would be great with some extra time wasters that aren't Discovery.

Eve is centered around pvp, small alliances can live easily if they become very skilled at pvp. As an individual you dont need pvp, but as an alliance you do. Either you fight for yourself or find someone to defend you. So if you want want to be a part of a smaller alliance then focus on pvp to help them survive. 
---
Logi is a good role to fill. Youll need a lot more sp, but train into t2 cruiser logi and the supporting skills and then start doing incursions. Its a great place to learn the logi basics. Plus its good money.
---
imagine a station /citadel where you could 'bet' supercarriers or titans
---
Nope because I've never talked to you before today. You're just sperging out and I wanted to get in on it.
---
Uh, this is Eve Online: Noted Space-themed Spreadsheet. Of course I'm paranoid.
---
I was flying 6 r 7 characters in incursions when I used to play great isk
---
\&gt; tl;dr looking at raw HP in isolation is completely meaningless. 
---
Navy battleships disagree
---
I’m saving this, although I got no one to share with. This image is so funny and accurate, I’m crying inside.
---
Those who generally give good fights to roaming fleets get more roaming fleets to fight. :shocked:
---
It's all good. I have no experience with game making. I just assumed that making images takes less time than making 3d models :)
---
Ignorance is bliss.
---
several day cycles is the best isk/h you can get from PI.
---
Good point tho, I mean I’ve been playing for a few months and I’m so used to seeing big blobs that it has become normal at this point lol, honestly didn’t realize..
---
What kind of spod brain doesnt change direction when they cloak?
---
Its cloaking 101
---
It's fucking reddit you complete twat.  We aren't writing an essay on phenomenological fucking ontology.  This thread is just a long fucking whine by people who're too shit at Eve to get any kills.
---
RLY ? I run burners and I get 100M/h / toon. I don't take LP into accounts nor drops though.
---
&gt;fly what new comers are suppose to fly, ewar and tackle.  
---
And you should fuck off lmao
---
So where has NC. Deployed to in the past 2 years. Because what I see is always goons or test deploying somewhere. And panfam just sitting on their asses doing what?
---
Horde isn't a feeder alliance for NC or PL.
---
I also think there is a common misconception that PL/NC has to change itself to survive, etc. We play Eve for content, have done so for 10+ years, and have been getting better at it every year. Whatever the meta is to have content, we tend to be the creators or the early adopters. I've said this a time or two but my youtube videos (toddfa) have been a good source to witness how the meta changes.
---
When slowcats were effective, we used them, and dominated
---
When RR supers were effective, we used them, and dominated
---
When titan only fleets were effective, we used them, and dominated
---
When dread bombs were effective, we used them, and dominated.
---
If things were truly bad for us then we wouldn't be among the top killers in Eve month after month. Kills = Content. If the goons want to take our fun away then they're a few years behind on what the current meta is. Titan fleets aren't the "most fun per hour" anymore and it has been that way for a good while now. If you want to test this theory then go ahead and take all of our structures and space away from us. You'll find that we're just as effective that month as the month before in becoming the top killers in Eve.
---
You begged momma goon to save you lol. Be prepped for the event Panfam denies so much content that Momma goon excommunicates lil TAPI.
---
I didn't know he played eve... Are you sure it's the same person?
---
We're talking about larger alliances though. Of course a small alliance can have "more per human".

---
You don't need to deploy your super fleet in full swing and shit post on reddit , you do know that?
---
Because Goons and Test were never at war before?
---
Yes let's tell a new comers to train for BS and T2 ships right away, he surely ill enjoy the 3+ months of training where he won't be able to fly shit !
---
Icelandic law requires CCP to take the game down for 15 minutes per day to force the most autistic of us to take a short break. It's a matter of health and safety.
---
How much was lost in rigs?
---
Well go run that in HS and have fun. 150m is the low key btw, especially with random skill books worth a lot more.
---
Large conflict is often put on hold near the release of a new expansion. Possible game instability while ccp works out the bugs can cause havoc with organized fleet ops and timers.
---
It looks like someone copy and pasted the eve logo on. What is there originally?
---
Hope you are not serious...
---
There is never a reason to mix gun types!
---
Rails or blasters.
---
Target painter will not help. Web is a must.
---
Target painter is a nich module that works on certain ships in specific situations. You dont fit one frig vs frig combat.
---
Lows: damage control, mag stab, small anc repper
---
Mids: 1mn ab, scram t2, web
---
High: three 125mm railgun (dont think enough pg for 150mm but i might be wrong)
---
Rigs: 1 damage rig + 2 bulkhead hull rigs
---
Its a valid fit that can work against some opponents.
---
Theres a fuckton of ships in eve, a lot of them can be flown by new players in a relatively short time. Destroyers and cruisers for example are fully capable combat ships that need very little skilltime to get going. [HTH](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Alphabetical_Ship_List)
---
Did I miss the paradox games? Where's the "Incest and Genocide zone"?
---
I think he meant abandoned by CCP because, let's face it, someone will learn how to exploit it and it'll get negative press (rightly or wrongly) for being a gambling simulator like loot boxes etc do.
---
Americans and their guns...
---
Or you could queue in 40m caracal when no one is playing and just the loot. Might be more profitable on average imo :D
---
I'm going to say what I understand you to mean, add a few of my own ideas which are relevant along the way, and hopefully that discussion goes a bit better.
---
- Part of racial flavour is leaning towards different tank types: Amarr armor, Caldari shield, Gallente either/both armor/hull, Minmatar either/both shield/armor.
---
- BS are not in a great place in the meta: they're slow, they're very vulnerable to capitals (heavy fighters anyone?) due to a combination of sig radius, speed and the amount of buffer you can get onto a single health type with a useful combat fit.
---
- The Leshak is slightly smaller, slightly faster and significantly more biased in its HP pool distribution across the three types. This greater bias is one of the underpinning strengths that lets it punch up so effectively.
---
- This article is an exploration of the impact of changing standard empire t1 battleship HP pool distribution to display more bias, along the same lines: Amarr lose shield and gain armor, Caldari lose armor and gain shield, Minmatar lose hull and gain shield/armor (either flavouring ships towards armor/shield, or making them even more ambivalent) and Gallente lose shield for more armor/hull following same rationale.
---
- You argue that many 'off-race' tank fits are the way they are for both the strict necessity of slots being used for other purposes, and due to the weakness specifically of low slot count shield tanks e.g. Full jam Scorpion with armor buffer, Boosh Raven with armor buffer.
---
- As the base HP pools of many of these off-race tank types are low anyway, with most of the HP coming from plates/extenders, you suggest that those fits remain unaltered, whereas there may be increased viability of e.g. a minimal shield tank jamming scorp, or a shield buffered boosh raven.
---
- As an intended bonus, many of these ships when fit for racially appropriate logistics-supported buffer/resist configurations now will hold up better in volley-based situations, and saliently, against capitals. To which you append your desire for 3200mm plate/XLSE.
---
I think that BS layouts, stats and bonuses should generally lend them more to being buffer based, reflecting their ship of the line, logistics supported role, which is largely in agreement with what you are suggesting, and I suspect your choice of language (namely around the overloaded meaning of tank) has caused a lot of the resulting challenge to your ideas.
---
Here are some thoughts of my own:
---
I think one of the underpinning aspects to BS weakness in current meta, one which has been growing incrementally over the last decade (driven initially by nano buffs, then the probing changes many years ago I believe, then further exacerbated by MJD/MJFG) is that the value of (pseudo)static distance is incredibly low. 
---
I’m going to talk about ‘operating range’ as the range at which a hull can reach out and do damage, and ‘range dictation’ as the capacity to create a speed discrepancy which allows the ability to dictate distance. I’m also going to call 0-30 km short-range, 40-120 km mid-range and 150+ km long-range. 
---
One of the core strengths of BS is their projection capacity: power at long-range (artillery/beams/rails/cruise), and the flexibility of their short-range weapon systems, able to reach out well into mid-range (null/scorch/javelin/barrage) or entirely operate within that range envelope e.g. locus-rigged Megapulse, ambit-rigged 800mm AC. Correspondingly, core weaknesses of BS are range dictation and application at short-range, especially with the longer ranged turret options.
---
Back in the days of warping long range BS fleets to pings at distances that favoured your doctrine over your opponents (sometimes a difference of only 190-200km mattered a lot), then aligning to sun and trying to warp out if you were primary, there was a mad scramble by tackle to try and get close to lock BS down before they warped off, and a skilled combat prober reduced the window of advantage to 60 seconds instead of minutes, and was worth their weight in gold. 
---
The Rokh was introduced to give Caldari pilots a meaningful option to fly in instant DPS wings in the meta of long range battleship fleets, intended to line up against the Megathron, Apocalypse and Tempest (later Abaddon and Maelstrom, though arguably they were designed to fulfill a mid-range role), but easily exceeded the (then 250k) maximum lock range with 425mm rail optimal. The increase of this to 300k should have given the Rokh its time to shine, allowing a 425mm Rokh fleet to skirt on the furthest margins of lock range, forcing Amarr and Gallente applied damage down to near zero, and Minmatar into deep falloff unless they repositioned in a game of cat and mouse. Alas the game had move on too far.
---
With the advent of &lt;10s combat probing, general speed increases for smaller ships, and later micro jump modules, that distance can be closed fast enough to make the trade-offs of the fits designed to operate at those distances (relative fragility, poor application, low sustained dps) not worth it. Adding carriers that can apply from thousands of km away using NSA further diminishes this long-ranged ‘ship of the line’ BS niche.
---
Then comparing to hulls like arty Muninns, which might only apply reasonably to 100km, but go 2.5x as fast as the battleships, even neglecting probing and MJFG, you have very little reason to suffer the inflexibility and mobility issues of a BS fleet over the more agile HAC fleet, before considerations like the total SP required for such doctrines, which arguably favour the HAC, and certainly favour battlecruisers like the hurricane and harbinger fleet issues.
---
While solutions to enable long range BS do exist (facetiously, just have more command destroyers than your opponent, voila boosh BS doctrines, or more seriously, for defensive actions where warp mobility is less of a concern) they obligate the use of mechanics which are currently overtuned (MJFG primarly), and result in one-sided uninteresting gameplay.
---
In short, operating range is nowhere near as valuable as range dictation, and has only become less valuable over the last decade. I’d suggest tweaking probing mechanics as one way of affecting this balance, so that many ships on a grid being scanned causes the scan error to go up exponentially, making combat warpins harder to achieve (with whatever rationalisation of sensor noise/distortion you choose). I also think MJFG need changing, itself the topic of an entirely different thread, but they should reward more considered use, with consequent penalty to poorly chosen use, and should definitely not be infinitely chainable as they can be currently.
---
Holy crap - if that's true, stand by for the outta control 'video games are bad/made him do it' outrage bus.
---
To the OP, I sincerely hope your friend makes a full recovery.
---
&gt; Horde isn't a feeder alliance for NC or PL.
---
Who said they were a feeder alliance? Of course you never actually promote the untouchables. That would completely alienate the two or three people in the top caste who actually do things. You just use that as the carrot -- pretend like there is totally a promotion path, while never actually doing it. It's kept the untouchables caste docile and obedient for years.
---
It's less the images and more the code behind it and how the code interacts with already existing features. Plus they'd have to determine if it was actually worth putting the effort into. Maybe we'll get something in the future with PA leading. 
---
We don't need "easier" access to things like scanning. We need other activities to engage people in the game!
---
Well no one knows since u done get killmails with them 🤦‍♂️

not elminer, im disappointed
---
Ncpl have always been the bad guy.
---
And they are barely use and if they are it's suite inconsistant. You can fly tackle and ewar almost all the time.
---
I felt the same way for a time. If you want someone to bounce stuff off or fly with in game evemail me. Vitaliy thirteenth. I'm on in later EU and us tzs.
---
Ewar and tackle are fully capable combat ships.
---
If you have a mexican standoff in the beginning, it is the difference between win and lose.

It was the first MMO after all

Multi dollar empire !!!

Or jumping in your entire supercarriers at 0 on the enemy fleet. No risk at all xD
---
The usual cycle is an entity takes a large amount of space, then grows stagnant as they have nothing they need from anyone else. Eventually the good FCs leave or go inactive, and the group's concerns are dominated by money. Eventually their greed outreaches their grasp and they get their shit kicked in by (usually smaller) active, experienced, motivated groups who suddenly find themselves in possession of a large amount of space...
---
Some groups deal better than others with this "affluenza", and take active steps to keep their 'content creators' active and happy in an effort to stave of the decay. But to date, every large spaceholding entity in EVE's history have been through this cycle. In the last few years we have seen the fall of:
---
(Currently) NC/PL/PH, aka "PanFam"
---
Last year: The "Drone Russians" - a combine of Russian groups that held the drone regions for almost a decade
---
2017: Stainwagon: Another russian-led group based in the regions around Stain
---
2016: the CFC/Imperium: the coalition led by goons which held most of the North (from Cloud Ring to Geminate) - mighty as the Imperium appears now, it's less than three years since it was perceived to be equally mighty, but in only a few months every sov system was lost and many of the previous members left and/or disbanded.
---
I very highly recommend [The Empires Of EVE](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Empires-EVE-History-Great-Online-ebook/dp/B01DONPR0M/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+empires+of+eve&amp;qid=1558877941&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1) for a detailed account of the history of the game up to just before the start of the fall of the Imperium. My understanding is that Mr Groen is working on a sequel
---
Sweet, and once again thanks and I appreciate the reply. 
---
I’ll check out the book, I’m normally not much into reading but I’m finding this very interesting so that should be fun.
---
I was planning on guristas sites. Do you know roughly how the factions rank in terms of tank requirements?
---
You can fly everything all the time, dafuck is wrong with you?
---
what about Resource wars, decent reward?
---
Hey bud, sorry you had a difficult time in TEST. Dreddit has some support for new players but it's more aimed at people who've been around for a bit (let's say "newer" instead of "new"). Our new player focused corp is called Brand Newbros.
---
Regardless of which corp you choose or where you go, I hope you get out there and start enjoying the game. I think you might be falling for a common misconception where you need to train up to be "good enough" or "ready" to get out there/leave hisec/join a good corp/whatever. That time never comes, just jump right in and go do something that sounds interesting to you *right now,* while continuing to train and invest in your long term plans on the side.
---
ok it sounds juicy, bit far from how I can play the game atm, like wormholes are dangerous and can get ganked at any given time right?
---
Test alliance bots confirmed.
---
Ewar and tackle are roles first and foremost. My point was that theres a big variety of ships being able to fill a variety of roles new players can fly relatively soon so trying to pressure them into certain roles is retarded bullshit.
---
Positive Daisy... drop me a line on Discord! @Baliskner#3768. I can help guide you as well!
---
Cool. Thanks for the advice.
---
It's called undocking
---
Yes go fly a T1 dessy in a large fleet fight. You will have so much fun.
---
Pazaak pls
---
No, I want to allow many styles of play to be enjoyable. The current ruleset doesn't allow that, it allows capital supported blobbing and near-risk-free krabbing, and nothing else.
---
And really, even as a nullsec blob player, you should still support small fleet operations being enjoyable - because what are nullsec blob linemembers going to do to have fun if there's no subcap roaming and counterplay from a standing fleet? "Light cyno, drop carrier" is not fun gameplay for the people in the blob that's dropping them either, particularly if you don't have a carrier yourself.
---
'Sandbox' refers to the player controlled narrative and not having game-defined quests, not to the ruleset. Wormholes are just as much a sandbox as nullsec
---
You guys are dumb. Just move your capacitor.
---
Are you aware that theres more in the game than massive nullblobs? If not i highly recommend you to look around and make some new experiences lmao
---
Witnessed many such returns of former content-creators, so far none of them lasted for more than a couple of months. They all start active and hopeful, but it doesn't take long for them to remember why they had left in the first place =\_\_=
---
There's only two ways something like that could end - either the station games are more fun than Eve, in which case they'd take activity out of space, or they aren't, in which case they will remain unused and be a waste of dev time.
---
Though it would be quite nice if the next Project Discovery could have some collaboration aspect.
---
What did you use to make these? They look really nice.

---
Of course you take LP into account, that's where two thirds of the value are.
---
10 burners per hour in 0.5 is 140k LP + 100 or so million ISK. Which translates to 250m/hour in almost all empire LP stores.
---
Interesting question.
---
It might they do not do multiboxing that much while the other side do it at rate like 13+ accounts..
---
Or maybe they do not want to get in a clear losing fight which reasonable.
---
You should consider that almost of the players is not an actual player also.
---
cause almost doing 2-5 accounts and the rich players do more than this.

---
Test members supporting the Eve Online community confirmed .
---
Firstly, "CCP said so" is enough evidence, because it is CCP that dictates what counts as faction, T1 and pirate.
---
Secondly, Triglavians are a non-empire "standard race", and CCP is fleshing out a full line-up of ships, as opposed to the 3-4 ships that Pirate factions have. And thirdly, the evidence is in the HP pool, which is considerably lower than that of faction ships.

---
&gt; There's only two ways something like that could end - either the station games are more fun than Eve, in which case they'd take activity out of space, or they aren't, in which case they will remain unused and be a waste of dev time.
---
As much as I wanted more with Ambulation, this was my biggest issue with it. Anything that made it worthwhile would effectively be not-EVE, and (as was shown) if it wasn't worthwhile it wouldn't be used. Personally, I just wanted a Space Bar where I could hang out with my space friends and watch space ships out the window. As neat as that would be, I would rather the development time required for that to be put towards things that EVE actually is.
---
Don't remove local. Local is a balancing force between small and large entities.  I promise you, if local is removed, big alliances will wet up networks of alts on gates to track neutral activity.

I would have played if pc. Fuck whoever made the decision to be console exclusive.

Some more reason for NC. To not undock?
---
Walking in stations needs a shabby looking Red couch and an Exotic Dancer pole. Maybe a fedo food and water dish.
---
Can confirm, have used 3 Shaks and a Nestor in the past
---
Currently we have a situation where the weakness of PVE ships mean they reqire saving by dedicated PVP ships.
---
This has led to people banding together to provide support to eachother.
---
What we need is a reworked PVE that will allow PVP combat ships to be effective in PVE. Reducing the need for mega blocs to form
---
so where have they deployed
---
If test cared about the eve community, they wouldn't be Goon pets.
---
&gt; Why can't I fly those? Surely you can find small scale PvP encounters that don't require everyone to multibox Titans and make it to the mainstream media.
---
And this is why the current meta whereby you can drop capitals on everything is bad for the game.
---
But yes there are many corps that will take you in as a newb. If you don't know what you want to do, Eve Uni is a good place to start.
---
Don't discuss this too much. You don't want to ruin CCP's business model.
---
Never stopped them in the past.
---
Congrats tdsin, the elders of anoikis
---
Ab or mwd?
---
I can't even list all the deployement I did when being in NS alliance so how am I suppose to remember those of an alliance I never was part of
---
Yeah some of works and some of it seems to be limited to making a spreadsheet. 
---
For example; https://zkillboard.com/ship/19722/kills/lowsec/ Is all kills by Naglfars in lowsec, however the url https://zkillboard.com/ship/19722/kills/lowsec/201905260800/ Which should be all kills in low sec by Naglfars on the 26th of May 2019 at 0800 just returns the previous selection of kills.
---
It may be that zkill can only show very simple calls outside of making a spreadsheet.
---
how did you get the havoc flair ? ))
---
I agree with you.
---
This Game is complex that the elders in game is more experience than the new one.
---
Some information not being shared and you must dig a lot in the internet about eve
---
to catch small pieces and build a knowledge from it  (youtube safe the time).
---
test stuff and compare and risk it.
---
That will make you rich in knowledge and you will need to work your self and bypass the
---
path your self.
---
easiest way is to pay real mony to CCP so you buy plex and sell in jita for the highest
---
known price in there which is for now like 4.1M per plex (the price will change).
---
I do not recommend that cause it is bad habit for your self and will make you realy poor unless you are rich.
---
The hardest way is the common one so you collect ISK your self  Via Missions or mining or ratting.
---
You can do via exploring and trading.
---
But i think you will grow your wallet to like one or two billions (with nine zero) because something unclear.
---
To bypass that limit you will need to be patient and focusing and you will need to keep working over monthes.
---
The result will be after years.
---
There is something called ratting but that start from 3-5 Million per 20 minuts  if you do belt clearing via destroyer or normal cruiser.
---
10-20M if you do VNI in cosmic sites.
---
80 if you do carrier ratting.
---
\+120 if you do super and titan ratting.
---
Luck is a way also for income which not all having it.
---
The players that a part of alliances like CEO or directors they have privileges so they can get to omega from corp or alliance wallet.
---
campers is a part of that by the ways.
---
You will see a lot of selfishness mockery hate drama rudeness lobbyist ..ETC
---
And you will find helpful players ,mature in mind and knowledgeable that share ...ETC
---
With this complexity you have two choices.
---
Adapting or leaving.
---
Adapting is good but at the limit if you have fun other wise it is better to leave.
---
I like the idea of that the best ship is a friendship but that not true and it is trap especially in big alliances.
---
your limit will be five to 7 players max and temporary .
---
the friendship will start if it moved to real live otherwise no.
---
I hope that explained something for why is the elder in the game is the richest and how is the game work.
---
You seem lost.  I was like that when I started as well.
---
EvE is about making your own goals, regardless of what others try to tell you.  I've had more fun "doing it wrong" then following the herd.  I would advise you to do the same.
---
As for what to do?  That's the hard part.  What did you like in the starter missions?  Check out those activities you enjoyed.  If you haven't yet, run the SOE epic arc "The Blood-Stained Stars."  It's a long chain of missions, with story, that takes you around high sec.  The end is a bit tough, but you can always ask for help in local.  Gets you out of the station and doing something!
---
Check out the ships in the market.  I fell in love with the Proteus my first month, and worked towards it.  Gave me a longer term goal to focus on.  Maybe you'll see something that catches your eye and gives you direction.
---
There is a lot you can do in EvE, the trick is to figure out what YOU want to do.  Then, go for it.  Space trucker?  Drug Maker?  Mission Runner?  Explorer?  Small scale PvPer?  New Eden is your oyster.
---
Fly safe!
---
ESI access should be removed entirely from this game. want to know what your line members are doing tough shit, don't hire them if you don't trust em.
---
Every esi scope is taking a job away from a player and CCP wonder why they hemorage sub's nowadays.
---
"nc doesn't want to play with few deployments, mostly sitting at home"
---
"ok where have they deployed to? seems like the groups deploying recently are test and goons"
---
"they have deployed!! they just don't make a big deal of it!"
---
"so where have they deployed"
---
"i don't know"
---
you aren't making a compelling argument
---
This depends on what you want to or are skilled to fly. You can do this with as little as 20 AB catalysts.
---
Let him yellow box you, warp off to a ping and return so he’s spending a ton of time acquiring lock.
---
Make sure you have a stash of catalysts in system as replacements, if one is lost you warp off. Grab a replacement and return to the fight, works best with Bowheads
---
\&gt;  With ECM being changed, I feel like now is a good time for CCP to finally tweak the T1 scorpion and actually provide it with some combat bonuses. I think the ECM strength bonus should remain, but it should lose the optimal range bonus and gain a damage bonus of some kind so Caldari can actually have a proper line-up of combat battleships like every other race.    
---
So you want to remove the only ecm boat that gets a range bonus to burst jammer just to give us another boring F1 battleship, not to mention that range bonus is the only redeeming quality for a scorpion to be even considered being used as an ecm boat. Thank you so much for that.
---
Games are nice and short too so you don’t have to sacrifice too much of your time.
---
aren't goons deployed right now to the middle of the second strongest groups space?
---
kind of signalling that they're willing to commit
---
Why is the link being hiden ?
---
If they didn't show you in local until you broke gate cloak, that would be enough.
---
It still rewards people looking out for each other and organization, but it's a significant nerf to those who dock up every time a neut enters local.
---
From my point of view the jedi are evil.
---
You are exactly why this game sucks these days
---
&gt;From my experience, Eve is a game where the rich massive coalitions only get richer and bigger, while smaller groups die off or get absorbed and new players quit because there is nothing to retain them. 
---
well, your not wrong.  but i'd also like to point out that, being a sandbox,  thats to be expected.
---
see the real world,  small city states and feudal kingdoms got absorbed by the largers,  as the largers had stronger forces, more industry, and wealthy.
---
heck theres a saying about "rats flee a sinking ship" which was also true for countries who were dying.  the wealthly flee it.
---
so while it is a bit saddening for small corps, its also showing the sandbox is in fact working.
---
the best you can really do right now, is to either join a larger country for protection,   or be a colony(renter) for them.
---
Local acts like wormhole local *except* that it automatically breaks when you break gate cloak.
---
I have only one and I am having a lot of fun flying just frigates. Depends on what are you looking for. But I agree with the other answers, shitty Corp. Get to one more relaxed.
---
&gt; Goon pets.
---
News to me.
---
How is that try hard? Because I don't like stupid fucking mongs? Because I think the world would be a better place without you fucking mouth-breathers? That's simply wishful thinking.
---
Kerbal Space Program is also missing.
---
Aw it's so cute, the little dino hypocrite
---
It is a pity that the game becomes so boring as you progress. I guess I will try to delay my success into capitals and that complex stuff.
---
From a brief look at your comment history, you seem very unpleasant.
---
Im not in TEST?
---
Without a cloak on
---
I was going to give you a reasonable reply but then I realised how fucking ignorant you are about xix.
---
op success... you are shit at posting
---
They moved their caps out, can't dunk when the ball is in another court.
---
GWENT BUT IN SPACE
---
where and what are you hunting?
---
A man named Jeronica Runs it, dude is very legit. His structures are amazing and used by a LOT of people.
---
Happy bday!
---
&gt;They do it worse so we should be allowed to do it too.
---
I like that its like my sole reason of existing, as i cant tackle and structures and stationary.
---
Seriously. Dude should have used a knife like a man of culture.
---
Depends on how you've tanked it, if you've gone shield MWD, if you've gone armour have both
---
The only one worth reading is Andrew Groen's Empires of EVE; the first (and only published one so far) volume is about EVE 2003-2009.
---
Additionally, you can read an old wiki that has lots of history pre-2013: http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php
---
Who said anything about being powerful. Goons were never a small group in comparison to in time Eve groups.
---
Yeah, facts usually hurt the naive
---
wasn't mine i'm just the alliance cheerleader
---
Lol the game is broken..... plays 24 accounts at once
---
I'm sorry you had to find out this way
---
I dig, space pinball. Highscores posted per station/citadel from soho down to brighton.
---
Some crazy shit if you're right, and I don't doubt that you are, the char with the suspects name exists in game. 
---
When did SC bash his structures? Wondering if I was around for that.
---
Just remove it already, why should people be told who's in local in the first place.
---
I think, and hope, that gambling makes its return to EvE. Based one some interviews, I think CCP does too. But governments get crazy about this stuff. I think CCP will just need to make the tools which could be used for gambling and let the players build the games.
---
This is coming this year, this was originally going to be called EVE: Echoes I believe
---
I will add this to the r/eve discord
---
Really depends on what you want to do and how much you are willing to spend.
---
What I do personally because I use it for small gang skirmishes and hunting krabs, i.e I don't expect reps or to rep myself, either win, die or gtfo before I bleed armour is to shield fit it. Use the lows for some DDAs as your dps is only your drones, use the rest to get as much buffer and cap as possible and fit good neuts (as per budget), typically corpum c type or if you dont' care a-types.
---
With the recon at V, the curse is a very nasty ship, with 3 good neuts you can stagger dry pretty much anything from 40km range, or so how I play it.
---
Be more confident against Gallente ships and Amarr ships. As both of these ships predominantly use a weapon system that requires capacitor to fire. You shut down their cap and they can't do dps (excluding the drone boats). Need to interpret weapon systems on the pirate vessels. 
---
Missiles and Autocannons do not require cap to fire. So most Caldari and Minimatar fits will still be able to 'fire back.'
---
This fit seems especially cancerous and cheap -  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76877196/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76877196/) ,  but doesn't have much for tank. 
---
This fit would also be able to shut down most minimatar ships (keep up transversal) as the tracking disruptors with tracking speed scripts would force him to run.
---
Its a hell of a 1v1 or 2v2 ship. Has anemic dps, but the cap/tracking warfare capabilities are amazing. You are best suited in a duo that's co-partner will be able to keep the enemy pointed/scrammed, and do most of the DPS. Your neuts will shut down all active tanks, and take away the resist profiles of most buffer shield tanks. Make sure that you don't show your ship on dscan too early, as most people will not be interested in fighting a curse. 
---
Warp in at range and try and maintain a distance - while keeping your neuts in optimal. You are not a especially tanky ship and will be primaried early by competent groups. Its an expensive ship to play brawling styles with as your anemic dps gives the enemies' friends time to come to the rescue. 
---
Take a look at the recent Curse losses on zkill -  [https://zkillboard.com/ship/20125/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/20125/losses/). Find what you'd consider to be a competent pilot or a competent group - or a ship that makes sense to the way you'd like to play. Take what you like out of fits and add it to your playstyle. 
---
If you have logi you might want to go with more buffer, lets you stay on grid more. 
---
I would practice in the sentinel - as it has a similar play style, is a lot cheaper. You'd be able to do more experimentation with the same isk. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76922624/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76922624/)

*WOOSH*
---
...I feel naked without a cloak...
---
Wingspans videos got me into eve the first time too
---
You have a place on my ballot sir
---
I came here to say that this looks suspiciously like the layout of my last fortress. Glad to see this as the top comment.
---
This post here makes me think he should take it down permanently
---
Supercap ratting, rorqual mining, or extra hours at job. Unbeatable. Except if you trade trillions...
---
Tbh all ESI data needs to be deleted and the ability to see cynos  across the universe wtf
---
Shield, mwd, nano fit. Small gang neut boat. Minimal drone dps. Don't get tackled
---
I feel like you're missing a current status page (or a channel where the bot clears any content and posts the current status). If people started using this, they'd have to scroll back through conversations to find that a timer is running if they are from a different timezone and log on at a time different than most other users.
---
Also, you didn't provide a way to remove timers so if people mistype something, there's no way to fix that. They'll just have to wait out the timer and live with it.
---
I do understand that your bot is just like 15 lines of code and can't be expected to do all this, but here's a few ideas that you could consider working on next.
---
Ah so you're just sucking off the good lord vily because if other people have been doing it for 10+ years it's completely fine if legacy do it too
---
Oh goodie, I get to do an aar. that was great fun. 
---
We were returning from doing a thing that was the opposite of fun when we passed you, we were like 'wtf homie, let's fite' and the fc was all like "fitey time, it's fitey time'. 
---
We minced around on the other side of the gate for a little while. And the FC was "THAT BIFROST! DO YOU POSESS! A MODULE KNOWN AS A MICRO JUMP FIELD GENERATOR!" which I did because I am a good bee and a solid bro and the FC IS LIKE "ARE YOU AWARE AND ABLE TO EXECUTE...... the manoeuvre known amongst your brethren as...... THE PICARD MANOEUVRE!"
---
Comms fell silent and waited for my reply, knowing full well that the outcome of this battle hinged upon my answer. "probably." Comms went fucking nut shaking wild. "JUMPJJPUPJUMPAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISENPAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII" 10,000 procurers blot out the sun! HALF A LEAGUE, HALF A LEAGUE, ALIGN AND MWD ON, GET FUCKING REGT SON. 
---
CHARGE FOR THE PROCURERS, CHARGE FOR THE DRONES, INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH THAT 1 BIFROST RUN. PROCURERS TO THE RIGHT OF ME, VENTURES TO THE LEFT OF ME. BOOSHED FOR GLORY, BOOSHED FOR MITTENS PBUSH, BOOSHED FOR DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH, DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH RIDE NOW FOR DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH.BOOSHHHH FOR DEAATHHHHH.
---
10-ELO would yolo ships all day long
---
Try again, join Horde or Karmafleet (grr goons).
---
Make an active effort to participate in activities, be active on voicecoms when appropriate. Eve is a game where you get what you put into it.
---
Can only speak for Horde, but there is a place there for even 1-day old alphas, but you have to be engaged and make an effort. Nothing is free.
---
You're retarded and it's adorable how utterly stupid you are. 
---
Also. Still not a legacy pilot?

Garbage application, garbage projection, garbage velocity, garbage 4 mids, garbage unreliable damage source.

---
"facts"
---
The fact that there are bloc ballots still baffles me but then I guess it's not too different with Irl politics.
---
Love it. I will push out an update with some of the features you requested. Below is my current list for next build, some you suggested, others I have thought of brainstorming.
---
1. Help menu which provides list of commands
---
2. Status of current timers
---
3. Delete an existing timer
---
4. Option to enable "Clear Channel" that will remove any chatter from the selected channel
---
Let me know if you guys think of anything else.
---
Well I'm currently being "unpleasant" to some moron who thinks tornadoes in tornado alley is evidence of climate change. 
---
People are retarded and so is more bots in eve.
---
Having enough people would strip their 'waah waah we are outnumbered' argument
---
Can you post where to send a card or if they need help?
---
thanks for this the guys ought to get a good kick out of this
---
Hahah you need to chill bro.
---
"much" is the very least amount of paranoia required to survive in EVE. I'd highly recommend taking it up to a "excessive" or even "obsessive" level for optimal results.
---
No, that app was a joke made by a few students and nobody uses is the way foreign media suggested. The app acts as a wrapper for the Book of icelanders, a geneology database that - nonsuprisingly - is mainly used for research; albeit it is semi-open to all that hold icelandic citizenship.
---
Most people have a fairly good idea who they are and aren't related to; and those who aren't probably notice when they start talking about their family.
---
FW seems to be the premier source of lowsec income around here - can make a pretty decent buck running FW missions. I would suggest joining a lowsec oriented corp until you get your sea legs and flying cheap until you figure out what you want to do. As for actually combat in my experience in nullsec you fight the pilot in lowsec you fight the fit. I reccomend watching some lowsec streamers to see how they do it as well. I live in Black Rise near tama sadly that area has been pretty dead for a while so I suggest amarr/minmatar FW regions. You will lose a lot of ships before you figure out who in a given area will give a decent fight who will blob and who flies max bling/implants. In lowsec you end up fighting more less the same people over and over so reputation does matter more then in nullsec where you roam all over the place. As for logistics a blockade runner and a DST really help. I suggest buying hulls in local lowsec hubs and shipping in the fittings yourself. You will save isk and by buying hulls at location you save yourself a lot of hauling (Mods and ammo take very little rom as opposed to hulls). Joining a corp can help with that as they might have a JF service. Black Frog/pushX/haulers channel are great as well.
---
Ha dude you are so right. I camp rookie chat all the time and pm people who seem new and ask good questions. Most of the time if they just chat with me for a bit and seem interested in the game, I’ll send them isk afterwards lol.
---
I lived in FW LS for quite some time, but I never made my monies there. Except from juicy wrecks.
---
I had an Explo alt doing circles in a half dead NS botting pocket which always had plenty sites. Easy ISK.
---
Spent that ISK trading in Jita, making more ISK. Money makes more money.
---
Caldari is currently T5, you could run FW missions for a bucketload of LP. 
---
Pls do cash out instantly, I need more DNIs for 110m a pop.
---
I find most MMO gankers  to be lazy and want to make it easier to attack. The real answer are skilled players with numbers. That requires a social structure, and a story that glues everyone together.
---
CCP wouldn't be CCP if they weren't pissing our money away into at least one new project at any given time that will be a total failure/never see the light of day.
---
Realistically you’re not going to notice a difference either way.
---
D2 LAN parties are some of my favorite video game memories.
---
Right up there with Super Smash Bros for N64.
---
IDGAF, the N64 version of Smash remains the best version ever made.
---
Fight me.
---
This was the tactics they used for the war last summer. they make an Ihub timer, and you form up, then they deny you the fight, or just show up to trash your ships. they repeat it till you make a mistake, then they take the ihub, then since cyno jammer is no longer a problem as the Ihub's strat index goes back to 0 when it's destroyed (that index only goes up over time, you can't farm it). so just do your part and join fleets. KQK keepstar is in jump range of Tribute. So it still matters.
---
It’s pretty nice. I use the 50M tier and it really helps catalog everything
---
just let the newbro ask his question
---
Thats not a feature i want to have.
---
Eve is about space, doing activities in space, so making activities within stations is going backwards. They need to implement mechanics so people have to go outside, take risk, not being playing in the safety of a station.
---
Says he doesn’t want to grind 18hrs.....plays mmo. Then t cries about people who play the game for what it is and are decent without trying and don’t see why it should hold said tryhards hand the whole time and said try hard gets butt mad and wishes people had been aborted...yeah that’s not wishful thinking that’s a retard with rage problems that are self induced.
---
you can blitz lvl5s with mjd bargehsts
---
We started in June of 2018. What happened was his corp kept on reinforcing our POCO's so we told him we would give him a better tax rate if he stopped. He did for a week, but then went to hitting them again. After that we were like fuck it, and just decided to start burning his shit to the ground.
---
Are you thinking that they'd concentrate all fire on one structure.at a time even knowing about the cap?
---
Will TAPI blue them?
---
Or
---
Will TAPI be blueing them?
---
Though blueing is not an actual word...
---
God I wish. Suitonia made having good standings with NPC's and fighting alongside them look like a blast, so why the hell wouldn't you want that?
---
You must be an intellectual. Good for you!
---
&gt; Also, any tips/general advice for lowsec? Been reading a lot of posts and a DST seems to be at the top of everyones list
---
Yes. I lived in lowsec a big chunk of my Eve life, and I find having a t2 hauler alt invaluable. Sure, you can courier contract stuff from Jita, but not having to rely on others is big in my opinion. I used both blockade runners and DSTs. Both are safe in lowsec if you know the landscape (and know where competent campers may operate).
---
A DST can fit about 60k m^3, that should be enough to ferry down ships and stuff. I used my blockade runner on occassions because its speed, not its covert cloak.
---
No I was thinking they’ll put 1 titan per structure across all of Eve
---
As soon as I figure out how to automate the process of adding Factorio to .png game lists I'll let you know.
---
brb need more iron
---
I think boring is the wrong word. The real fun comes from interacting with humans. Once you got the basics down its a fairly repetitive game. People is what it actually makes interesting even for introverts.
---
There are few regions that have gas signature in them and supposedly each of them has one "hot spot" constellation. In this constellation one of the gas sites will awlays respawn in the same constellation.
---
A few years ago I used this fit and liked it, or its slight variation with 5 neuts (3 med 2 small) on the highs.

Woah, I've never seen such a negative response from this community. Especially all the name calling. I have no idea why everyone reacted like this. What the heck. Usually we're a little more supportive for new people. 
---
If I were you I would move assets back to a safe location and drop corp back to your starter corp. While you're in the starter corp there should be a chat box that is 'alliance' or 'corp'. In this chat box ask for people that are recruiting newbros. Keep trying new groups, people looking for new players usually have recruitment alts in these starter corp channels. Eventually you'll find a good group dude. 
---
Eve is very frustrating, especially when you're new. Its a game that rewards a lot of patience and dedication. Its a game that is usually done in a group, and its the interaction with others in your corp and alliance that are the only 'sure' thing while playing eve. You can sometimes go weeks without a 'good' fight. If you join a corp that doesn't have a third party communication system set up (Teamspeak, Mumble, etc). Leave. 
---
If you join a corp that is mostly a different timezone. Leave. 
---
If the corp is controlled by someone who is an excessive asshole. Leave. 
---
A huge part of you having fun will be finding the right group. Sometimes the biggest group is not the best bet for new players. My first group was about 10-15 people strong, we were all terrible and had a blast. 
---
Get ready to receive criticism from players that have flown a lot longer than you. Heed their words and decide if its good advice. Theres a lot of morons with only a basic grasp at how to play this game, yet act like they're god-tier because they anchor up and press f1. 
---
If you strive to sit in the biggest and best ship you're going to have a bad time. Need to try a lot of different ships, and yes they all take a long time to skill into. 
---
If I were you I would focus on getting all the engineering skills and specific guns/logi-module/drone-skills skills to level 3, and the ships you want to fly to level 3. Then upgrade your engineering skills to 4, then your ship skills to 4. and work towards level 5s. Meanwhile you keep being able to fly more modules, and ships, and don't feel like you're stuck in a station for weeks while you train for a single ship, only for the FC to call for something you can't fly. 
---
If you're interested in Flying Logi - I would work towards the skills that let you fly something like this.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76923336/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76923336/)  
---
Click "show info" on each module and select requirements. It will show you what skills and to what levels you need to have to fly this ship. You can use meta-modules if required. Click on any module, select "show info" then see the variations tab. This will show you modules that are 'like' the module you currently selected. The compare tool is very valuable at the bottom of this tab once you get the hang of it. 
---
You're going to have to get used to flying t1 frigates, t1 destroyers, and t1 cruisers for a long time. Its part of the game. 
---
to take away a lot of the stress of this game I fully suggest you spend an extra 20$ and buy yourself a plex package (on sale right now). This will net you about 2 billion isk on the market and you'll have a lot more fun when isk is not an issue. 
---
Please don't think this means you can fly all the expensive ships with all the expensive modules - you'll lose them and be back where you started. 
---
Don't worry about this reddit thread dude, this is the best game I've ever played - but its also not for everyone.. Its for lonely people with a lot of time on their hands.
---
If EVE is at the bottom of the rabbit hole, why do give so much attention to the demands of self-described "casual" gamers?
---
Who remembers the cries of *Where's the money, Vuk Lowski?*
---
The more things change, the more they stay the same...
---
I mean, you do you, but the geddon has 6 turret/gun hardpoints (I alternate between RHM and RLM) and plenty of space for custom drone flights. 4 mids are plenty, when all you need is a grappler, scram, injector and MJD. If you think that deep AC falloff (without any bonuses) can compete with drone/RHM projection, you're just plain wrong. Besides, the more time they spend shooting my drones, the more time I spend killing them.
---
Find a few system that are pretty quiet in hisec and start scanning. In hisec you are looking for wormholes that say “leads to null security/unknown space” those will be nullsec or c1-3 wormholes and will often have pirate data and relic sites. MAKE SURE it has a pirate name (Sansha, blood, serpentis etc.) because other ones have rats that will kill you. Once you clear the system of sites, you can either go back through to hisec, or scan to another wormhole system. Repeat for profits.
---
[here](http://www.toptiertactics.com/21341/eve-online-exploration-guide-billions-and-billions-of-isk/#axzz5p3987ouz) is a good guide. It’s a little old, but 99% of the info is still accurate.
---
PL was deployed against TEST/CO2, then deployed in Providence for... 1 year, then back in TEST sov and you know what's hapenned.
---
Since the WWB, NC was the babysitter of the north. Protecting renters, GOTG and sometimes PL deployments
---
&gt;Option to enable "Clear Channel" that will remove any chatter from the selected channel
---
No I mean, a specific status channel where others aren't allowed to talk and the bot just posts the current status there. That would probably be the easiest way to go.
---
10000% sure
---
Setup planets to make passive income, it alone can keep you supplied with cheap ships. Level 5 missions can make big money but require serious investment. Can do abyss anywhere and day tripping into wormholes from lowsec is the quietest holes. You can also do exploration both relic and combat, but you'd make more doing the same I'm npc null.
---
Standard advice for any ratting is kill the stuff scramming you, then the stuff messing with your tank (webs/neuts) then start at frigates and work your way up. This can change sometimes because of specific circumstances, but it’s usually a good tactic.
---
Yeah you might remember Keldor giving your FC a dirty stratios and an apology on behalf of Daniel to get you guys to leave. Daniel kicked me out of the corp in shame a few days later. He was practically crying on teamspeak while he was typing "fuck you faggots" in local.
---
Honestly i'm considering approaching the DA with my chat logs with the guy to help establish his character. He's a dangerous nut job and they better not give him bail.
---
Oh, I see what you mean. Okay, noted.
---
Who on earth makes 150m/hr running T5 abyssals? I normally expect 250m/hr profit on average, after the cost of filaments, and that's with the most expensive filaments currently (exotics).
---
And with straubz quitting
---
Oh yea lol. We wanted straight isk but you didn't have the amount, so we figured we could get an equivalent value another way. What is actually disconcerting is that we got an eve mail from an alt threatening to dox or worse some of our gay alliance members as we were burning the area to the ground. All starting to make sense now
---
This is just fantastic. Your perspective will help break eve's staleness. Keep up the great work, and I hope you can shake things up for all of us.
---
Half or double your dose.
---
WBoo Who.
---
Would a Gnosis be good enough to destroy Sleepers in Bountiful and Vast wormhole gas sites?
---
I'm sorry for what you're going through but that article basically doxxes 2 players. The comments are going deeply negatively and directly doxxing others. I've had to remove the thread because of this. I hope he gets better and the situation turns out fine but sadly the witch hunt here won't help.
---
I'm gonna let you read over the shit you were saying and then think about that. I had a fairly measured response, you were the one fucking sperging out on everyone. I haven't raged the whole conversation. I've just pointed out that you and people like you are a waste of good, breathable air.
---
The Mittani is always right. There's a reason the New Order of Highsec continues to recognize The Mittani as the legitimate Chairman of the CSM.
---
Congrats, have you blued TAPI yet?
---
upvoted.
---
It's even in CCP's interest to make walking in stations come back somehow, so we would actually have a reason to buy apparel.

I run PI and do 5+6/10 DED sites

I had that dream. Then I realised that CCP can't make it happen.

Eve hasnt been at the bottom for awhile
---
I did think about joining a corp but I imagine my corp history is going to be a bit of a turn off. Just over the last month I've been in 3 different corps, so I understand why most wont be interested but until you join a corp, you don't know what they are like
---
Man, if it had been Planetside 1 instead... Well. Let's face it. If Planetside 1 still existed, I wouldn't be playing EVE. I have so many awesome memories of running around with the Sons of Vanu, third-partying our way into TR/NC brawls.

Good times...

Hot spot constellation = The shattered wormholes dude. So yes, but only because they’re special. I wouldn’t lump them into the same category as you can’t really anchor there.
---
No prop BS.  You obviously do not roam solo in battleships.
---
No prop bricks were maybe good for sitting on gates before booshers existed, but nowadays they are free kills.
---
Roam 2 jumps in it and die to the first, well, whatever, because you have no control over the engagement.
---
Would you go so far as to call this a Strong and Stable bot?
---
In my experience they’re home and just pussies.
---
But I digress. I said anxiety, but it’s from accidents like rolling myself out, and the sheer length of time it takes to roll.
---
Have insta undocks for your home station(s) or use citadels, station camping is a thing that can happen. Making isk from faction warfare or from clone soldier / mordu's rat hunting while you do your solo pvp roaming is quite solid once you get a feel for routing through belts quickly.

From my time in EVE the Machariel was 6 guns with a 7th added later. Was this different when first released?
---
What's a TAPI?
---
Yezh I heard that from some pl guys
---
Discharge elutriation rigs are not enough to make it stable with ab and booster off. It's only with the use of either 2 capacitor control circuit IIs or 1 capacitor control circuit II + 1 discharge elutriation II that you can get it stable with ab and booster off; the latter is worse than the former since you end up eating up more of the power grid than if you just used 2 capacitor control circuit IIs.
---
C2 suck ass.
---
Only way to plex from there is what I did to go Max PI on 3 chars in that account.
---
Then afford yourself a solo krab naglfar (BEFORE you plex your alt)
---
Then you plex and train scanning skills on said alt &amp; you can run all the C5 &amp; C6 sites you want bud. I was doing C6 sites in my naglfar and I easily made the Plex in 2hrs. Like. Give me 6 months and I’ll have the wormhole white picket fence.

Yeah i was kind of laughing at first but when he started crying I had to think of a way to give you guys a reason to leave. A narrative victory at least! It was a fun night but I've often said this of MMOs: They can be a prison for the mind, and some people belong in said prison.
---
Didn't realize we'd fallen apart (panfam), or was that earlier and I am part of panfam 2.0?
---
It is known
---
Congrats, your content is now safe.
---
As long as you aren't in any of the systems that are on a direct path between those two systems you will be fine. Further from Jita is safer however. Remember, don't just look for direct HS&lt;&gt;NS connections. Instead look for systems you can build a chain out of. Systems with C3 statics or wandering holes (holes that aren't a static WH) are a good place to start looking. Check out [Tripwire](https://tripwire.eve-apps.com) for a good mapping tool.
---
Don’t listen to these fucks that want you to pay IRL for an in game advantage.
---
I’d only subscribe additional accounts if anything at the 1yr subscription rate.  I make overtime everyday (12hr shifts) and I don’t spend any on eve. Paying off debts is more important.
---
Go max pi. With 1 account and all chars pulling / factory you can make about 160mil every other day. About 40min of work. If you never miss a cycle its about 2.4Bil a month.
---
Then get your alt up to speed ASAP and both of you into Leshaks and running C5 sites.
---
Then this is the end goal for anyone without friends. [C5 krabbing](https://youtu.be/7fujQNeLPd8) I’m soloing C6 sites with the nag fir so its dank.
---
But C5’s are safer as theres many factors more of them. And you can c5 highway till your hearts content.
---
this post is not about goons having 2000 tianas...could be nc or pl or test...is just about how shit ccp is

A gnosis may have a difficult time with C3/C4 gas sites. A Gila or Paraxis are good options however.

FPS-wise I'd suggest not to go lower than 25.
---
prety much...eve become a game of mining and afk/bot  farming
---
well it always has been, the pve drives the pvp. with out the pve player's you don't have you modules or ship's,  you don't have to do it but null sec alliance's have to realize they need pve player's to build the base for there pvp.
---
I run lvl 5 missions with carriers/barghests.
---
Entry price is kinda high since it requires a carrier/barghest and 7.00+ standings with the faction. But the isk/hour is pretty good it has a slow start but once you have more mission pullers and a barghest/carrier in every system of the constellation it really takes off :)
---
Mastercrab
---
Why don't you post with your main account instead of hiding behind a new one?
---
Idk man. You gotta be pushing $50 an hour. Otherwise you’re wasting your overtime as it’s more efficient to run wormhole escalations for the isk. 
---
Just saying. That’s good money I’d rather keep. I will however support players buying the DLC star packs as they’re a one time only boost that’s a good value🙋🏻‍♂️.
---
You're not a casual normie then. Check again

Very funny, thank you. Are you just funny or you also have some advice?

You need a 144hz 4K monitor for effectively perform an officer hunting

That's how PA make games. They only want people to farm 23/7 and RMT the fuck out.
---
Thanks dude
---
Same thing happens with capitalism
---
&gt;just because you don't have a reason for it, doesn't mean reasons don't exist.
---
Most of them are shit.
---
&gt;MOST BOTTERS DON'T DO THIS.
---
&gt;how many times do you have to be told the same information and go in circles around it?
---
You do not know this, do you understand that? Are you CCP?
---
&gt;You seem to forget, once again, that you don't need to ban VPNs to disallow botting,
---
There is no good reason to allow people to protect their IPs and mains by hiding behind a VPN.
---
&gt;just to track it to have the same effect.
---
It doesnt have the same effect because people can just create new bots and take no risks.
---
That perfect intel. We must have it!
---
Tldr: dont spend your money on anything but concrete investments
---
Question are you saying there are more people farming and mining in Frat vs Test or are there just more people using Rorquals?
---
I've pmed you
---
&gt;I'm genuinely a new player who doesn't know what to do and I was called an entitled, lazy bitch and a cunt.
---
The true "entitled", lazy, and cunty ones tend to be defensive like that. Any attack on their privileged and 100% safe crabbing is met with aggression.
---
&gt;Maybe I was just expecting too much, maybe new/low SP players just have to get out there and find the stuff themselves in the wiki or something.
---
The game is designed to encourage them to join large alliances and become an f1 drone or quit.
---
Yeah, lets make sure there is nothing else out there.
---
Check out rankedftw for the numbers it actually has been pretty healthy after going free to play. 
---
I played some today fantastic game
---
Lets make the game as shitty as possible so players have to struggle or adhere to what you want!
---
One must have is a porn hub account !
---
Be a good sport and just own up to your initial typo m9
---
&gt;Tl;dr. Lets make PLEX hit 10mil.
---
Yeah, we haven replaced enough players with bots yet.
---
Yes.  Many people suffer from this. After all half of people have an IQ below 100, and it shows
---
r/eve salt incoming
---
basically you need at least 2 carriers for the higher tier officers, otherwise you won't be able to break their tank
---
Then it should have been nothing. You're tying it to a game that should continue on well past the consoles life cycle in a place where you user base isn't. It was quite possibly one of the dumbest decisions made. And that's a feat because have a fucking own of retarded ideas :|

If Brave is still as dedicated to learning new players the game as in 2015... Brave is the way to go :)

I have heard that rumor too. Could you point me to some hard numbers?

my personal opinin is sc&gt;hots
---
Question from a newbie - how much booshing speedta king oracles would it take to break their tank?
---
No one really cares where you have been before. I think that goes for just about all corps in eve. You will not get access to anything important off the bat anyways.
---
not what I said. 
---
Only the spin that TEST harbors most botters is now definitely proven wrong
---
Well the two corps I happened to show interest in were not very welcoming due to my history :(
---
It's a combat recon, doesn't show up on dscan regardless.
---
Reports also indicate NC. Is looking into new evac doctrines to skillfully withdraw from any region the trigs attack
---
If you can get scram on the assfrig you’ll kill it fine with heavies. If you can’t then you’ll never kill it at all
---
Just fit for dual rep and a few neuts, and either MWD or overprop.
---
Oof
---
Probably need at least 150 EHP. 
---
I don't recommend doing it on a shuttle. Move up at least to a Venture.
---
Yo, just hear me out.
---
PLEX cost is a function where 
---
($of plex) = ((Botters)/(n of PLEX))
---
They wont be able to afford their accounts if nobody bought plex.
---
Lets drop the floor out from under the botters.
---
If you're going to apply that logic, then you also have to consider that time = money and in that case every hour you spend on EVE costs you an hour of overtime.
---
Conclusion, if you're so poor that you're heavily in debt then you probably shouldn't waste your time in EVE. And if you're making decent $$ then you probably shouldn't waste your time VNI ratting to 'save' money.
---
If you want something to do you are supposed to use the 'undock' button.
---
i know an eight that'll fight anyone
---
I mean by that logic if you ever buy a house or car you shouldn't do anything non-essential until you pay it off.
---
Bots will be the only ones able to afford plex.
---
&gt; PL was deployed against TEST/CO2, then deployed in Providence for... 1 year, then back in TEST sov and you know what's hapenned.
---
&gt; Since the WWB, NC was the babysitter of the north. Protecting renters, GOTG and sometimes PL deployments
---
so nc hasn't deployed other than to protect their renters and borders? sounds like a less efficient goons model without the foreign deployments
---
&gt; If you work overtime to pay for PLEX, but still have any type of debt. It’s mathematically the same to borrowing money to pay for EVE as you’re spending longer in debt.
---
Yes because this is a much needed reality check wait no it's not.
---
No, they don't (the RMT part). You do not become a billion company by being that dumb
---
So bit coin, dot com's, pharma patents &amp; government bonds are all out? Cool you've just wrote off the most profitable investments in the last 30 years.
---
And why my thread, lol? Why?
---
From someone who had killed quite a few officers not to squash your dreams but unless your using caps there almost impossible to solo.
---
You're asking a question that isn't going to be easy to find answers to.  I've never seen any info written down about officer spawns, obviously there are people who know how to spawn and kill them but they aren't talking.  If you want to go down this road it is something you are going to probably have to figure out yourself.
---
For “reality check” in the title, presuming 2bil/hr in-game income is a bit extreme. 
---
But if consistently true, props for the dank ticks
---
bots can be alpha
---
You're retarded and it's adorable how utterly stupid you are.
---
Can confirm. VNI ratting is literally cancer.
---
Yer right. Will edit.
---
Am I the only one who really misses CQ? Like, I don't even care about adding more stuff, I just want the old CQ back. It was super comfy, and cool to be able to see your ship floating there. Unpopular opinion, but I think it added depth to the world. Honestly I'd be happy enough if they just added back what we used to have, but I think it would be extra cool if there was a unique one for each type of citadel.
---

No dwarf fortress, no team fortress. Whats op got against fortresses?

30 - 40$ per hour lmao
---
As someone who has worked in Eastern Europe for $4 an hour these numbers seem comically high.
---
Houses are fine.
---
But my driving is as bad as my spaceship flying so yeaaa.
---
This is fine for starting out but it could probably use some ironing out:
---
A) Don't reinvent the wheel, discord.py already has a command decorator so you don't have to parse out messages yourself (it also means if there is another bot with the ! prefix the admin can change the prefix easily to avoid overlap): https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/commands.html
---
B) Users will abuse the fact that they can essentially @here spam on a 4 hour delay.  A simple fix would be to make it so that the bot only @'s the person who sent the message originally which you can get from the message context.  A more complicated fix would be to gate the initial command to a configurable approved users list to prevent abuse.

Everyone’s got dread alts yo. Its 2019.

Depends which one. Imperator Rome and Hoi4 are normie tier. Hoi3 is esoteric tier
---
I came across an officer only once in my whole time playing. It wasn't me that found it, but i know he spent a long time just belt farming to try get one. When he did get one I brought in a HAW Naglfar to kill it. It died fairly easily (after my several mess ups).
---
Average trade work, electritan, carpenter, plumber etc make this as a normal hourly rate.
---
&gt; If you see 50 connects coming out of a single IP, that probably means someone is running a bunch of bots.

holy fuck you're retarded, please delete yourself (ingame)
---
Amazing video. I quit the game in ~2016 for real life reasons, and am coming back and trying to generate my third major small gang pvp corp (Mafia Redux, Furnace, and now dead.Orbit). We are trying to base out of a WH and pvp from a nullsec static (we were originally one of the first groups to do this, and before ns static, we did it from c5-c5s).
---
It baffles me how many groups that I knew in the small gang community simply don't play anymore, or have been consolidated into one larger group. EVE is already demanding enough of our time, and to think it's gotten to a point where you can't get those simple fun fights with a smaller group of friends is sad.
---
We're going to keep fighting the good fight, and try to make it work, but I have no doubt it will be an uphill battle. Watching this brought me hope, where this subreddit has brought me increases pessimism. You have my vote, keep it up man.
---
Will be very interesting to hear whats wrong with that example.
---
The logistics issue is probably the most correct answer, but another thing to consider is that Goons have historically been bad at the beginning of a war (see the Fountain War and the Halloween War). It takes them a while to hit their stride. They eventually won both of the wars I mentioned.
---
Do you legitimately believe all (or even most) people who use that many accounts are botters? If yes see my last comment.
---
If I make a fancy emblem and call myself a government would you buy currency from me? Even if my said government has run said currency into the ground before.

---
Fuckin aye. Less that 10 hours a day = why bother even subscribing?
---
I really do not "roam" solo in battleships. Because "roaming" in battleships is extremely slow, boring, and most often suicidal, on account of caps. Your 1500m/s will not save you from a ramjag, nor will your two heavy neuts or your mids. In the current meta the difference between a tempest and a geddon is right around 0. I take fights in plexes and on WHs, and in that envelope, the geddon shines.
---
There was a time when I took a nano, triple hyperspatial, MWD geddon out in null, but that time was three years ago. The game has changed. Solo battleships are kinda dead.

You need T2 transports for doing your own logistics.
---
Well, since a carrier does 2500-3000 dps on average with decent skills i'd say probably 5000-6000 dps to break the top tier officer rats

Goons - badly organised LOOOOOOOOOOOL.  :p
---
If you want to run 50 bots, how would you do that?
---
They have to suffer to weed out the weak.
---
From why I’ve heard is 800dps-1,300dps depending on tier of Officer
---
Yeah, it is the hardcore crabs we want!
---
I'm reviewing the documentation you submitted. 
---
I do see what you mean about abuse, but this is more directed towards a corporation's discord. Not a public Discord with random members. I'll  see about entering in a rate limiter, but I don't think abuse should be too big of an issue as a person who would abuse it and spam would probably not be allowed in the corporation much longer, but who knows, right? Something with roles maybe a valid option. I'll think about it. Thanks for your suggestions.
---
Why would anyone commit against them though? everyone knows they have N+1 but only at certain times.  
---
they have 800 toons online in their deployed staging system, and they are running 2 max style fleets per day, but afk most of the other times
---
Heavies will be fast enough to kill an aasfrig though without a web?

How to spawn it i read that you clear like 1000 group of NPC so clean like +1000 belts.
---
They said it is will spawn after 25 green spawn being cleared.
---
The more rate for it to spawn is in true security which it is the systems that with minus to -1.0 .
---
The more it is minus the more possibility .
---
More info that it is more to be in the regions that owned by it is faction and not in player owned speace.
---
More info that i saw it in a systems that is 0.3 so there is a chance to have it in there.

It dose not come alone it dose come with four battle ships.

Sooo eve is a niche game.. Not everyones going to like it. Unfortunately your title is right small corps are dying and have to work 1000xs harder to get anything done. But at the end of the day its ours not goons or tests or PH.. Its ours.. 
---
That being said.. You needs some friends lol go out in space talk to local chat with people. eve can be very toxic.. But its also the most embracing community I have the pleasure of being apart of.  You just cant be.. Well.. Whiny... which is why youve gotten so much flack..try wh stuff if you dont want to join a mega corp.
---
T3 is usually best. But you can solo it with most battlecruisers and decent skill
---
Loki or Tengu is best these days.
---
Me too man.
---
I get it. Hurf blurf we're leet autists who play Eve... But if you actually look at the graphic it's kind of terrible

Thanks so much.
---
It makes sense what  you are saying. I'll implement your advice.
---
Just a note I run fleets of three to 5 pilots so results may vary lol entirely possible to solo them tho.
---
Imagine paying high taxes to your libtard  furry sympathizer alliance for them to srp freeloather idiots. Yickes commiestomper!

Aw, come on you pussies put it back up.
---
The big thing is that EVE time is \*more fun\* than working overtime, and if it's not, you should dramatically re-consider how you're playing EVE.
---
Also, not everyone has overtime opportunities - I'm salaried, so I get the same (decent-sized) paycheck if I work 40 hours/week or 50 hours/week. Similarly, not all debt has the option to repay early or faces penalties for early repayment (though this is less common).
---
I just loaded the fit, replaced the cap rigs by elutriation T1, and it gaine d10 GJ/s
---
There isn't much info because spawning them is pretty random. If you warp from belt to belt a lot then this increases your chance of finding one. You can cycle the belts for a year and you won't force a spawn. The chance of finding them increases a lot more if you are in the pirate factions space. In ops case, venal.
---
It is unlikely you have much of a point. If you dont understand why my example does in fact make sense, you wont understand the problem with VPNs.

For PVE either some anoms, or running FW missions.
---
Otherwise, just to get some bucks you could hunt Clones and Mordu's ships in belts.
---
But yeah, having some alt in null or wh to earn steady easy isk and fuel your PVP endeavours is much more comfortable.
---
(If you wanna go pirate and like to try solo with ocasional small gangs, Stay Frosty is recruiting).
---
Also takes 4-5x as much isk and sp investment. Nvm pvp
---
Who said I multibox that many. I only run two or three friends man friends.
---
 bro i couldn't even test it out because my game broke
---
Would love to have a meet up in Colorado around the Denver/Springs area.
---
Why dont you tell to me what it is you see? I dont think you can, but lets fucking hear it already. When you have done that, tell me how you would run 50 bots.
---
"I have been playing for a month and think I understand the game"
---
The battlecry of a toddler who broke their toy?
---
Jeronica is a good bro.
---
Pretty simple when you think about it, but its not the point of your shit post. 
---
SRP, sov costs, fuel costs, discounts to caps (yes there was that for a long time) etc etc. Having ISK for when there aren't renters topping up the coffers. See, not that hard.
---
Why aren't they handing out titans? Because when most of the people that want and more importantly will use it already have one, the uptake is lower. Same for Supers, not many people have a use for 2 or more Supers/Titans other then hanger ornaments.
---
Apologies, the wording sounded like you were running 5 alts at once lol. Still worth! High class space is dead.
---
Scanning and scouting in a dread isn't very fun. You could switch and relog depending on what you need but it would be cancerous. Also means you need a Fort, also means you are locked to one system and overall quality of life just sucks.
---
Minimum two accounts; one 100mn T3 and one Nag. One rolling battleship on a third character and some hauler on a fourth, doesn't necessarily need to be on a third account.
---
True I guess I did make it seem as tho I do lol naw I only run 2-3 ships, live in a c2 static c3-hs so c3 are our bread/butter.
---
I mean we tried to move up to a c5 a few years ago..got some station losses to show for it. So we stay lowkey, Weve been working on a raid fleet for c4-5 but 5s without cap support is kinda dumb.
---
I need pilots before we think about 5s again three dudes isnt quite enough people to fight off the likes of LH and HK.
---
Whew thanks for the good laugh
---
I didn't have cap support until 9months of having my c5 that I maintain essentially alone. A friend helps with anchoring just to cover my butt and help close holes as necessary. 
---
Don't anchor with open holes. Scanning new sigs immediately and having rollers ready to close new holes is key. It's not as scary as it may seem. But I also have 5 subs I pilot simultaneously so there's that xD
---
yeah i dont think you can solo any officer in a 2b rattlesnake with rat specific hardeners and hivaa bcu, the angel officer would alpha right through that and kite the fuck out of you and an estamel definitely needs atleast 2k dps to break the tank.
---
when is ccp going to ban this blatant botting??
---
I guess I am special then.
---
its been a rough ride for NSH ever since the pingas incident.
---
God the whole community would appreciate that.  They got shrooms now. Right?
---
And I just tested it again myself (with scorch crystals equipped, ab off and booster off), and it went from 12.9 GJ/s with 2 capacitor control circuit II to 5.5 GJ/s with 2 discharge elutriation I. Even with 2 discharge elutriation II it's still just 8.5 GJ/s. And that's not even putting into consideration all of the power grid that the discharge elutriation rigs are eating up, versus the capacitor control circuit rigs which do not. 
---
Either way it's still stable, but the capacitor control circuit II rigs does not have drawbacks and provides more excess cap recharge. So yes, it's still better than the discharge elutriation rigs, whether t1 or t2.
---
I've found one in my ten years of EVE simply by roaming in a Drake and going system to system killing one battleship for sec status. The second one was a ping in Corp to kill it. 
---
Never on purpose.
---
http://discord.gg/Gr5gZRP
---
sorry i guess i was rp'ing the retard too hard
---
&gt;  I was told I will be paired up with a mentor but nobody ever approached me 
---
So....did you read the forum post where it tells you what to do to get a mentor?  'Cause it doesn't involve "sit there and wait for someone to do it".
---
There's a reason there's one, gigantic "Info Station" thread on the forums that leads to you everything in the corp...
---
This, btw, is an example of why people are replying about "attitude" - you were expecting it to be done for you instead of making it happen.  That doesn't work all that well in EVE.  You need to make it happen if you want it to happen.
---
&gt; I already said I'm a noob, but if you look at the ship tree, there are smaller logi ships. Why can't I fly those? 
---
You can.  However, frigates don't have a very large EHP pool, so logi is less commonly used on frigate fleets.  It's very easy to get to the point where the enemy fleet does enough damage to kill a frigate in one shot, leaving no time for you to repair the targeted ship.  So "warp off when you get mass-targetted" is what they commonly do in place of logi.  (Or the DPS needs to be assault frigates, which take a while to train)
---
When you're talking about small frigate roams (about 10-ish), the extra DPS of you in a combat ship is usually more valuable than logi.
---
Frigate-size logi are also designed to repair frigate-sized ships in terms of their repair output.  You really need cruiser-sized logi for cruiser and up fleets because you need the larger repair output.
---
If you want to start flying logi now, it is extremely likely that your corp will happily take the T1 version of the logi ship on a fleet if it's a significantly-sized fleet.  For example, Osprey instead of Basilisk.
---
Not too sure, but probably. I know there's a weed shop every 20 feet. Haha
---
Reported for Botting
---
Then you were only making half the isk! Cap escalations use to be bank! Lol. 
---
Naw apparently the locals were more active than we thought.
---
 I have to many operations going to commit to a c5 like that lol. Nvm all the other work involved.. Its just to easy to undock in NS and make bank with deds.
---
actually you're right, tested again and it's more cap per s with CCC than elutriation.
---
Do you make that much of an impact though?    Last time I looked at the MER, Delve mining and ratting for that month was 18 trillion.   In order to counteract that you had to kill 600 bil a day, roughly.    Has the increased whaler presence in Delve made the mining and ratting numbers go down?
---
What happend exactly?
---
What happend ?
---
Wheeler lied, dreads died.
---
We don’t talk about it.
---
maybe ask /r/datahorder
---
looking at your replies here, i dont think you comprehend 'reasonable'. So thank you for not wasting my time.
---
I mean that's why i chose it, last 3 years i only played games that required of me to prove my skill at so many different things, morality check, memory check, strategy check, reflex check, patience check, tests of strenght, resolve, knowledge, there was a even a game that reqired all at once, one mistake and a hour down the drain, or even the whole session had led to need for one more cycle of replay, i can say i wanna be the boshy is more bearable cu'z it had many difficuties and only really reqired reaction and memory.
---
So yea Eve online is perfect casual heaven, (tho that guy in last part of epic arc mission is beyond me, hopefully smartbombs that i bought will finally put his shields down for good).
---
&gt; From my perspective it seems like the attacking side is either not ready and really bad organised or they are stalling the war for some other reasons. 
---
as someone already stated the war doesn’t go 0-100 right away. both sides are moving ships, replacement ships, ammo, jump fuel, and super capitals (etc...) into position for it to go hot.
---
&gt; some other reasons. Now you may wonder how I came to this conclusion, well I am part Pandemic Horde and most of times Goons create some kind of timer and we form up for it they give up
---
eh it happens in both sides combination of FCs not wanting to take losing fights, or just meta gaming. it’s a valid tactic to bluebell enemy fleets into thinking “hey, i’m gonna skip this one because they probably won’t form/will run anyway”
---
&gt; Goons on this reddit while the biggest thing they did in this war for 10 days of their deployment was anchoring a keepstar which is not even in a Tribute.
---
the keepstar was dropped one jump outside tribute, so goons can safely stage capitals and supercapitals in a position where they can be used when needed in both tribute and pure blind.
---

---
Ehh....3 avengers aren't worth it. When's the last time you heard of how escalations work?
---
Hey friend. MacDermott here from goonswarm. If you Google estamel you can see a video of me failing with a max dps carrier though I was using the wrong fighters as EM seems to be the way to go with guristas officers. There is no better option for belt ratting than a high grade crystal, large shield boosting polarized tengu. You need next to 0 tank for normal spawns, and when you see and officer you warp off and get a carrier. Venal is special in that its officers tank more than any other officers but they don't do much damage themselves. You could probably take one down with 2 max dps rattlesnakes instead of caps. For a solo person fountain or stain are better options as they can be managed in a 50mn ishtar by simply staying out of range, and those officers do not tank much at all. Ishtar is the next best option to a tengu because of its warp speed over a machariel or rattle. Absolute God tier hunter is a hyperspatial ascendency implanted istabbed super with a mwd and Higgs anchor for instawarping but don't ever do that but do do that because its hilarious.

Oh yer , I did have a couple but I was waaay to comfortable and was pre aligned to my exit so I could quickly bring back a hacking frigate once the Data site was cleared, I will 100% be pre aligned to the safe from now on haha !
---
I've given up on trying to Plex my account. I am paying for two accounts and bought some Plex. Now I am doing market trading to finance my ships and occasionally buy some more Plex when it is on discount. 
---
I used to grind a lot. I started with mining, advanced to Rorqual mining, then went carrier ratting and then super ratting. All of it felt dull and boring after a while. 
---
Since I've stopped worrying about making ISK in game and stopped grinding for hours I enjoy Eve a lot more doing PvP, taking part in fleets and even occasionally do mining to build my own super for fun.
---
I mean old escalations use to be three or four per cap to 4 waves.
---
Sooooo a while to say the least lol. Not sure if they changed them further after adding drifters ive been out of touch with low class for a while.
---
It turns off microwarpdrives
---
It's been too long since a wheeler feed and people were getting antsy
---
you just need to up your scanning stats my friend and you can take a scanning ship fit it with all mid slot arrays to boost scan strength and then locate the site hit ctrl b to save it to book mark right click space to then access the saved bookmark on the drop down menu and dock up grab your combat site ship and warp to save o7
---
Because I don't take orders from bastards.
---
I would say either you are doing something wrong or your skills are low and you're trying to scan a difficult signature. You watch a video on how to do it?
---

Elasuss Herron. There's a name I haven't seen in years. Sup EH from your old corpie Dara :D
---
Ncpl is no longer the boogie man that used to scare eve sorry bro
---
Really well done video Olmeca, I enjoyed your calm voice and narrating as always.
---
What probe formation were you using?
---
even with basic skills and just using the default probe settings (Pinpoint not the wide one) you should be able to scan it easily.
---
maybe they were using the wide option for probe settings?
---
It's not the isk faucet it used to be. Dread ratting potential is better realized in c6s vs subcaps.
---
" up your scanning stats " which stats? I just bought medium slot equipment: scan pinpointing array 1
---
which skills should i level up?
---
Doing things in EVE can be very hard in the beginning. You need to ask for help. If you try something and can’t figure it out find help. It seems like you just want to leave, but if you give it another try, don’t do it alone, find friends, ask for help.
---
When you think you can loot guns on field so your FC won't notice...
---
The whole thing is the Fortress
---
Join the wormhole Corp. You don't need to stay. Just see what it is like and make some friends
---
go into your skill sheet and get the ones related to scanning up to level 4, get sisters probes and a sisters probe launcher and fit scanning boost rigs make sure you are using the default probe layout and not the spread one and you should be able to scan everything down except for level 5 sites.
---
Sweet write up, good job!
---
Combat probes are always a red flag telling you to GTFO, and as you saw, pre-aligning won't always save you. They can warp in a cloaky frigate to see where you're pointing. That's probably how they knew where to set up the rest of their fleet.
---
Still glad you had an enjoyable experience. Getting blown up is how I got recruited into wormhole corps. What goes around comes around.
---
If you have the safe in the same alignment as the home hole the cloaky eyes that are watching you will report you in warp to home and the enemy will blow their load jumping in to race to your home hole before you land but you never will land and give them the finger in local
---
Damn straight
---
Nice report. But that dscan is wrong.  Imperium doesn't have 1300 titans and 239 aeons, even though we would like too.
---
I had heard some contention about the # of supers and titans being utilized for this deployment. If you have an accurate # feel free to pm me :)
---
Based on some of my alliance mates, no way. 
---
Train up skills and save a new formation: the cube. Can post a screenshot if you need.

Get ready to put on your big boy pants. As a few other people here have said PvP is on super hard mode. Mostly because of how 'safe' you can be with blingy ships, and how frequently you can get small gang/solo fights in smaller cheap ships to hone your skills. In Faction Warfare zones are basically the established 'I want to fight people' zones where regardless of being in Faction Warfare or not people will want to fight you. There are noobs and idiots everywhere, but expect to find the most technical, cut-throat, skilled pilots in Low Sec.
---
Some thoughts on making money:
---
1. PI is great and easy passive income. Figure it out and produces some stuff. Without bubbles its also pretty safe to transport it around. Learn how to MWD+Cloak+Warp to escape gate camps.
---
2. 4/10 DED sites can be shredded in a T3D super quickly and easily. 5+6/10 DED sites are common and can be done easily and safely in a T3C.
---
3. Hidden Gem ~ 0.1 and 0.2 zones spawn fancy Clone Trooper NPCs in asteroid belts, their tags are a guaranteed drop and sell for ~ 25-30mil. They have a chance of spawning after the final 'set' for rats have spawned. They can be farmed pretty easily by clearing the belts, run a combat site, clear the belts, etc. The final set usually has a Battleship rat. I like to use a Hecate to do this as it's super fast and can melt through rats quickly.
---
Some things to note about your lowsec adventures:
---
1. Gates have guns. You're going to lose a ship forgetting this at one point, and get your Overview set up so Suspect and Criminal players are flashy ~ so you know you can shoot them freely without taking Gate/Station guns, and get used to that yourself.
---
2. Security Status means something, and not just about entering high-sec. If you're out and about and someone in local has &lt; 0.0, they are a PvPer and they are there to kill you.
---
3. Expect any ship &gt; T1 to be blinged the flip out. Without bubbles, and with NPC stations everywhere Low Sec is very 'safe' for players and their pods. And you have a lot better control over the fights you take and whether or not you get hot dropped and blobbed, and it's a lot easier to escape. You will encounter a lot of fancy ships.
---
4. If you want to PvP go to FW complexes. T1 Frigates will get you fights very quickly. If you bring anything Cruiser and up expect to get called out and blobbed. There are a lot of blue-balled low-sec alliances itching to try out their blingy pirate BS fleets.
---
Misc Tips:
---
1. Expect every High-Sec to Low-Sec transition to be camped, especially if it was a default rout ~ (use your map to see ships+pods destroyed, pods is a big give-away, since there are no bubbles you typically need a sensor booster to capture pods).
---
2. Make a 'Safe Spot' near the sun in every system you frequent often. When running away, dodging a camp, etc, this gives the impression you warped to the sun and helps you lose the chasers.
---
3. Get to know your neighbours. Low Sec is full of sociopathic gentlemen. You may be savagely jousting with them one evening, only to team up the next night to help take down a newbie carrier or super blingy ratting ship that got caught.
---
I love it how you conveniently ignore every war since WWB, most of which you lost
---
I'll take base sensor strength for 100 Alex!
---
Pinpoint
---
I'm not logged on so not 100%, but it should be like Astrometric pin-pointing and Astrometric range finding. They all fall under the category of "scanning".
---
Find the solution to your problem and keep on truckin' YouTube is a great source for video tutorials. My guess is that you just need a little more practice.
---
What radius scan are you using? You can make your probes more focused by using the slider. A tighter scan (0.25AU) makes for better results where as a wider scan (4AU+) is really just for figuring out where the signatures are.
---
Astrometrics primarily. Since it helps all the things, then everything else in scanning but hacking, archaeology, and the one that benefits cycle time on cargo scanners and shit
---
And here I am hoping the collector's edition can still be found somewhere... I was late on the ball when it got sold out.
---
Ohh. I see. I always scan on 4Au. I’m gonna try .25 thanks.
---
good write up but you missed out the recent fight between test and frat over structures
---
Contact me in game (same name) I will give you any help you need.
---
Exploration scanning itself is one of those things you either get or don't. You can check out content made by EVEScout or Signal Cartel to master exploration.
---
You have to lower the radius step by step. So start at 8 au, then 4, then 2, then 1, etc. The better your scanning skills, the more steps you can skip. Some sites will remain very hard to scan down, and you need an even tighter radius then .0.25 au. When scanning sites i also didnt know how at first, but be adviced there are excellent youtube videos to be found in which about all activities within eve are explained in detail. Good luck.
---
Fair chance of that happening in most cases. I saw some stuff go down earlier today around 1500 in insmother between FRT and INIT. Apologies, I hope to try and get these things incorporated as I find them for our next one. Please don't hesitate to poke me in DM or post in our #intel channel in our discord. :)
---
NC / PL for at least a couple of the last 3 years had the attitude that they had “won the game” after they pushed the imperium out of the north. 
---
We were very weak when we arrived in delve, although not many big strategic assets were lost, morale was very low and we had been shown that we were not strong enough. 
---
Two very different attitudes for an alliance/group to end up with resulted. 
---
NC/PL believed the job was done, and proceeded to revert to their traditional role of galactic bully, meaming on former allies and any alliance that seemed like easy content. 
---
This resulted in perhaps the biggest mistake that’s been made in null politics in recent times with Test being pushed towards siding with the imperium after NC/PL basically backstabbed them. 
---
The Imperium for the past three years on the other hand has had the attitude that they will not be weak again, the goal being that even if the rest of the game (or most of it) united again against us they would not be strong enough. 
---
Evicting the imperium from the north basically fuelled the us vs them attitude that has been strong in goons since the beginning and the result has been full on paranoid prepping getting ready for the next time.
---
Not everywhere in the world...
---
I thought nsh is primarily americans. You might be talking about lsh.
---
Wheeler left NSH for Original Sinners in NCDot
---
Thanks. I just scanned a site. My ship won’t go through the acceleration gate. Geez
---
You can get 2 bil doing incursions in about 15 hours. If you do couple nights a week you can make it pretty casually.
---
And if you use a praxis, you have the added benefit of enjoying that phat ass view while doing so.
---
He only moved his spy toon over
---
First
---
Who?
---
Nah they are just late ustz Russians.
---
Make sense, rumor is he is FCing over there.
---
Most people fit these incorrectly. Test him and see what he is hitting you with. No web+target painter? Easy. Also create lots of bookmarks around the station and keep warping around, it will suck for him constantly locking you.
---
There's something about that KM I can't quite put my finger on
---
Do they not escalate more than once tho? O realize they nerfed the farming of them years ago. I assumed that is what the hubub was about at the time. Is full cap escalations reall not worth. How much is an upgraded wave?
---
Because in a sandbox, playing the role of tackle for a large null alliance is the only real route to take.
---
Lookin your assets. You may have items that were moved to asset safety... When a station is shut down stuff gets moved.
---
You get 12.9m per upgraded avenger. You only get three in a single wave. Not worth.
---
I feel very attacked right now.
---
he's complaining about not being able to do anything because he isn't rich and only has 3.5 mill SP. I'm just pointing out one of the easiest/fastest ways to avoid what he is complaining about, he could be doing the same thing with a WH group or in faction warfare or in NPC null. He could be do anything besides treating the game like a skill training simulator. But the one I suggested is easy and basically free because any null group worth playing with will just hand new bros tackle frigs for pvp and salvage ships for making money because they are dirt cheap to us and easy for new players to use.
---
Yeah this is definitely it. I actually think you would be good at eve because you sound ridiculously stubborn. That is good here. Actually if you get in a corp there will be plenty of people to tell you you are being dumb. Even if you aren't. And you get to call them dumb too.
---
I'm saying that goons and TEST were close way before PL got involved in that. Leadership already had deals with goons that most of the membership wasn't aware, but were in place since the Catc/Eso/Impass campaign.
---
But it seems you are as bad at posting as you are in reading and interpreting
---
So, uh, what *is* the Picard manouver? Jump into the enemy fleet?
---
“My IQ is too low for eve” yeah I get that feeling a lot when I’m playing eve
---
I think OPs point is: Less information = more room for errors = more opportunities for fights. Pretty sure he didn't mean to say that with perfect intel no errors are ever made, but if we nerf intel we will see more mistakes and thus fights. In that case Asakai is a valid example of OPs point.
---
It died of cancer the next year
---
Thanks everyone who did their part in Etherium Breach. Unspoken / JAG are good people.
---
Placing a structure for your corp will open you to wardecs, so unless you are able to defend it's not a worthwhile investment.
---
What are you scanning in and what site is it?
---
Beyond that it's often a good idea to have a scanning frigate on hand that is bonused for exploration, and a combat ship to run the site at lower skill levels. Scan the site in a frigate, right click save location, grab combat Later on you can do both jobs in a Stratios or T3C.
---
Scanning bonused frigates are:
---
Amarr - Magnate
---
Caldari - Heron
---
Gallente - Imicus
---
Minmatar - Probe
---
Those should also make scanning easier. And are also bonused to Relic and Data hacking.
---
Well shot trailer. Just nothing like the game itself.
---
Well. Actually. About that.....
---
Only in a wormhole tbh. Maybe some lowclass.
---
I mean thats a single c3 site per wave. But your also investing a dread ± other caps. I see the not worth.
---
You seem like you have some experience, how often do you find these.
---
&gt; Seriously, who has been sniffing glue at the office?
---
I think one of the volcanoes has been leaking gas into their offices for **years**
---
Does that apply if it's placed in High or Low sec? Do corps in high and low sec declare war a lot?
---
Why only Wormhole?
---
Alas, I always seem to take it out on a shield timer :(
---
how many of you are there if you are into making serious isk in that direction feel free to EVE mail me in game fluff alole o7 hope your eve adventures have been prosperous and fun
---
what is a wally
---
He doesn't realise it, but dumb a game down far enough and even the dimmest of players will reject it as just a time sink without challenge.
---
Good stuff!
---
Thank you mate, excellent post. Id imagine it's been asked a thousand times and I look into tomorrow (it's 00:30AM and I'm off to bed). Any ships you'd recommend for getting started in PVP? not looking to spend a fortune while getting the hang of things but don't want to be easy pickings either
---
I quit playing Eve two years ago when my WH corp disbanded, just recently subscribed again. What are a few major/important changes that have happened in the last two years that I should be aware of?
---
This is me except I just straight up skipped the hole and went straight to eve
---
High Sec is the only place that War Decs count. Everywhere else they just shoot you without worrying about Concord interference. It's easier &amp; cheaper to find an existing structure with the functions that you require that rents out offices in your area.
---
Best bet stick drones on it while you shoot the webs/scrams off your ship. They have crappy tracking
---
You have a number replies to your thread. Some helpful some not so... I play in the Australian (AUTZ) pm Deckert Udan, I'll help you out, if you want to do logo small 2-3 man fleets is a good place to start. There are plenty of players who understand new players that stay and subscribe keep the game alive.
---
yea i had that disk but it was stolen, along with the box and rifter usb hub... they also stole my speakers, tv, my suit pants and 1 shoe
---
One Pepega mistake I made in the beginning with Eve scanning is that you have to move the white box on the scanning window closer to where it is you want to scan. You should also try the pinpoint formation
---
It's really not worth it unless you actually enjoy having your own structure. In empire space you can use NPC stations or freeported structures, and although you might have to move occasionally or pay a bit more tax, for a small group that will be less than the fuel cost of running a structure, never mind the cost of having it blown up.
---
If you set up in a wormhole then it's worth having a structure anchored because you need it in system and no-one will leave a freeport around for you in J space.
---
Some KR guys are really good. This Boss Sausage guy brings his kikimora, bifrost, and scalpel into detorid and it's so hard to fight against. Either you can't catch them or small tackle gets raped by the kikimora. There's no slingshotting them either because there's always another target in the blob. No idea what to do.
---
&gt; My IQ is too low for eve

the most wrong sentence i've seen in this subreddit ever
---
i can't imagine being as stupid and illiterate as you
---
You have a big brain.
---
I miss pos mechanics and the days when the right answer was rob them to SRP your rattlesnake
---
I wouldn't, I was using a semi-blingie gila to force the spawns (In a decent Tru-Sec -.7). And then either 2x Carrier or HAW Dread to kill the officer (depending on spawn).
---
I can tell you getting spawns "reliably" is never going to happen. For an example, over a 6 month period. I think it was a total of 8-9 spawns (Unit-Ds to Unit-Ps).  In a 2 week spawn I was able to get 2x Unit-Ps, and a Unit-F. Then absolutely nothing for close to 2 months. Mind you same habits, same system, same ship, tz, etc. Nothing changed on my end, but I got nothing for 2 months.

That being said, I would say I averaged 5-6B isk per officer spawn, but good luck selling them for anywhere near market value. Some of them would sit on market for 3-5 months before they sold. I also think I was very lucky, and got 2x Unit-P FSUs and 2 or 3 DCUs.

Just too much of a hassle. and all it takes is for someone else to "run your belts" while your not there to get the spawn, and you got shit all for 3 months worth of "work".

TLDR; Don't much more fun things to do in Eve. Unless its a bucket list item, or something new to try to your hand at. I probably will never do it again.

That makes sense. We were just thinking about it because it would be cool to have a structure that's completely ours but you make a fair point

I dont know why this was downvoted but to OP: yes, this dude here is in fact one of the most helpfull and dedicated members of the community i came across so far and you should really take him up on the offer.

Not possible. Scott Manley had his daughter playing this game *years* ago and it has been dumbed down loads. Just check a youtube video on how to scan.

Idunno, I'm in Dreddit and run small gang, I'm really sorry nobody picked you up. I don't even recognize your name from the Discord, did you join any of our comms? I generally try to catch new people, and our mentor group is generally good. I really don't want people to be a number. I want people to get a ship and go get some content. We got a 3 man gang out and got some trouble and got a few kills on a Sunday afternoon.
