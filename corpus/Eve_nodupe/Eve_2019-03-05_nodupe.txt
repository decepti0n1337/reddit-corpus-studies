I hate how we kept the french spelling on all our imports.

You looked at the wrong thing, you only get 1 run copies from LP.

So could I have made 3 ships in that one run?

Nope, only 1.

I thought I was talking to a noob with 1 toon who happens along into a jsig with a lot of doable pirate sites.  For the record nothing is 100% certain in Eve.

Ill contend my advise is fine for his purposes.  Come back in 6-12 hours to collect your loot, on the off chance it gets reinforced.  To help alleviate this also dscan for structures, warp to 100 from dscan window and you can click the structure to notice if someone is online or not(player count will be in parenthesis).

Vince, really no need to downvote a 2 vote comment, just pass your advice and be gone bud.

Horde pride themselves in the low standards of admission to their alliance and claim to enjoy having hostiles roaming in their space.

Note that hunters who PvP your VNIs are playing the game correctly and deserve to be congratulated not derided. From their point of view, the guy who plays a PvP game and gets mad when he's not *left alone* is the real prick.

You should probably do what the other Hordelings do and get in standing fleet and on comms so your buddies can all swarm the next one to attack your VNI.

you know there is more to a fight then teleporting to it, right?

It did, you looked at it wrong, no origionals exist only 1 run copies. You might have linked it and looked at it wrong.

to your first question . kind of. in the sense that there are a lot of people who will be willing to help you learn yes. but eve is not easy to learn. there is not a learning curve but a cliff. well worth it if you can manage to get over that cliff. to your second quest. also kind of because of the first reason.

??? a BS doesn't go 10k/s and applies perfectly to the frigate. the carrier will have locked and killed the frigate across the grid before you could even lock it not even to speak of get into range.

its snuff dropping titans again on anything that might give at fight, what is new?

hmmm

There's a bug in the LP store. You click the "Show Info" icon on a BPC, but it links to the original. This also happens on cargo scans. The original is in the database, but not available to players. You only ever get a BPC from the store.

Dedication. You get rich just by spending a lot of time in the game, thats all. I've been playing since 2006, you just accumulate lots of stuff over time.

Anyway, yeah I was pretty fucking salty to realize that the bumped titan was faction. I raged at the pilot for a few minutes -- who was surprisingly chill about it -- and our mutual friends pointed out that there's not much point in owning a faction titan if you're not going to use it. We're not in NC.
---
I'm still 50/50 on whether it was a stupid idea or exactly how a faction titan is supposed to die, but whatevs. It was a great battle.
---
Is that an argument for giving every ship teleport ability?

I thought it was relationship... Sexual relationship the best ship. u.u

It's so they don't know we stole it.

"Newbie-friendly" can mean a lot of things. To some it means the game holds your hand and gives you free stuff. EVE isn't too big on coddling that way. To others, "newbie-friendly" means you won't be unduly discriminated against simply for being new. That's true for the most part. If you have patience and dedication you can be a successful player. "Catching up" isn't really a thing since there's no minimum standard. You will have to surmount the same learning cliff that every other player has.

That’s mainly because they can’t possibly imagine somebody doing something that’s not in their personal interest because that’s the job.

nope lol

Or it could be because CCP didn’t think it was a priority, and it was the CSM over multiple years that finally convinced them to deal with it.

I’m not the type to keep long journeys to myself
---
Then go for something not quite so well established. My old corp had guys that could only play on their days off of work, so they'd only log in twice a week. As long as you're capable of contributing and are willing to put in the effort to be part of the corp in any manner, there are a good number of corps out there looking for people to fill their ranks.
---
We can. It's both factually and likelhood-wise very rare though.
---
Are they still alive? Do they still run that campus in solitude?
---
Fuck off opec. Killer of circles 
---
Companies don't typically say "We let this person go, so we can get rid of the stuff they did"  especially if the stuff they did provides a perceived value.  They instead encourage the person to say they're pursuing other opportunities (either implicitly, or explicitly with a nice check and NDA.)
---
So they push them a bit out of range, then they fly back in range and keep mining.  What is the big deal?  Not much of an annoyance to deal with.
---
Its pretty obvious that CCPs solution to low sec is to make small gang PVP unrewarding in null.  I happen to like the idea with one exception, do away with gate and station guns.

you're right, in the sense of f1 fleets.

but, like, have you tried doing solo FW in tama? trying to gank in wormholes? this is a low skill ceiling? cornering the market of specific products in trade hubs? I have multiple max level characters in wow, and to say its like a lvl 2 hunter in wow is beyond hyperbole. 
---
if you find a task in eve easy, then i would suggest doing something else. yes, there is plenty of easy stuff in eve. you could mine rocks in a venture. you could f1 monkey, you could also ship spin, that's pretty easy too. but there's plenty of hard stuff to do if you look for it.
---
personally id like to see more of the faction toys getting used..    Ships are meant to explode
---
It might be slightly better, but in a lot of situations it wont make a difference. You will still die because of teleport.
---
It seems like an obvious case of keeping an imbalance in the game and deliberately allowing a shift to something that produces similar results. That every fight can become n+1 discourages content.
---
Yeah but it's fully AFK *and* straight up isk. It plexed my accounts for a bit.
---
Sure, it's not a big deal on the macroeconomic scale but to a single player it's a lot.
---
I fly an astero and tend to log off in wormholes just for the variety of where I may pop out the next day. I use an astero to bully off other exploration frigates. I leave when my cargo is full or if there's a threat in the wormhole popping up on my dscan over an extended period of time. It's a combination of how long I'm willing to wait out the threat, how much loot am I carrying, exit to HS availability, and am I sleepy. Somewhere in there I decide to just log off in the wormhole or make an easy escape to a HS station.

Gasp!

If an enemy of goons uses it, is fair gameplay and should be promoted.

If a goon realizes its existence and starts using it, is broken, unfair and it should be removed.

Right? It seems OP is projecting.
---
Exploiting game mechanics is never good and should not be allowed in my opinion.

F
---
They get two independent bonuses, one bonus for each racial skill. Each of those bonuses has 5 tiers.
---
For example, the ship you showed in your link was the Worm. That ship lists the following bonuses:
---
    Caldari Frigate bonuses (per skill level):
---
    4% bonus to all shield resistances
---
    Gallente Frigate bonuses (per skill level):
---
    10% bonus to kinetic and thermal missile damage
---
Each of those bonuses is completely independent of the other. If you have level 4 of caldari frigate, you'll get 16% bonus to your shield resistances, regardless of what your level of gallente frigate is. If you have level 3 of gallente frigate, you'll get 30% bonus to your kin/therm missile damage, regardless of what level your caldari frigate is.

You are REEing about some bullshit disguised as that.
---
It's neither factually nor likelihood-wise very rare. It's literally how every democratic government on the planet is designed to work. 
---
I get tired seeing the community blaming the CSMs for this perception when it's mostly bullshit. The guys who do break the rules and are in it for themselves get weeded out, just like in real life. 
---
Shocking, I know. 
---
I feel like I missed something. What is the point of the jeveassets process to get a list of what you are missing, when you can just see what you are missing in the industry window as per your second screenshot?
---
Does the stockpile function *reserve* those particular materials in jeveassets so if you haven't fully finished a build and some parts from another build still appear available, jeveassets doesn't factor them into what you still need to build for the new job? Thanks

---
Why on earth would you want portraits on in regular chat channels, you can fit four lines in unless you make the window take up half the screen. 
---
No one probably since there's no Fanfest anymore.
---
It's not bullshit. Your perspective on how democracy works comes from an old fashioned worldview where it's OK to have a congress full of (speaking for US) white men as long as these people think they represent everyone. The rulers vary country to country (in mine it's Sunni conservative males) but the logic is the same. It will fade away in due time.
---
We had this conversation before and I don't expect to change your views now. But you should at least recognize the perspective you base your opinion is pretty controversial even today and you can't get away from this by calling the other side's argument "bullshit". For Eve, people who don't share your playstyle can easily tell you are not fairly representing most playstyles by reading the summit logs. Can't wait for the next one actually.
---
Guard was the face on CCP. This is a sad day
---
I love sigs!
---
No. Snuff knows there isnt enough dreads in the region to kill their titans and anyone big enough to bring that many will get seen doing it. They deployed without titans to get fights before realizing they can't win without their titans. Sadly the content has died off now because nobody is stupid enough to put big assets on field just to feed them. 
---
I'd love to see changes to FW, the mechanics are super long overdue.  
---
Unfortunately both of these ideas are actually really bad and would cause there to be less pvp in FW. The first idea would actually HELP the most cancerous pirate or farmer groups who manipulate their home system contested level with FW alt corps.  Invulnerable FW Astras are a bad idea.  Linking structure vulnerability to system vulnerability take away almost all opportunity for an aggressor to influence the timeframe of a battle, and gives a huge buff to absentee time zone tanked defenders.  
---
The second idea would hugely punish the losing faction, limiting their options for pushing systems.  In the current meta Gal / Cal warzone, GalMil recently took almost every system a few months ago.  Pretty much immediately, Caldari were able to start trying to plex backwater systems and look for weak spots to retake.  Under this idea, Gallente could have just camped them into that last system forever, trapping them into even more of an eternity of Tier1.  
---
What FW needs are a few solid "comeback" mechanics for the underdog faction. People have suggested nuking the "tier" system entirely.  I think the way to go is to create a "bonus" mechanic that designates a particular constellation as a priority target for the "underdog" militia.  Whenever a the lower tier militia plexes in that target constellation, they receive equal LP to the higher tier militia.  This would have a positive effect of concentrating pvp in these areas, and reward the players seeking out fights instead of the people spinning buttons in ventures in backwater systems.

Because the portraits are often more interesting than whatever people are talking about.

If you re AFK in a Rorq you deserve to lose it in the most horrible way.

I know a fun lil system where we talk in local all the time, even with neutral intruders. And its fun most of the time :) I mean... EVE is a multiplayer-game :D

Not saying you have to but there are multiple low responsibilities corps

Miners will never understand. Truth doesn't matter to them. Just ore and afk mining. Bot-aspirant's only know their truth. Sad!
---
You'll have time if you join the right corp
---
You must be new here.
---
If you have no one to scout for your freighter and move your stuff around i'd break it up into regular industrial sized loads to move it if you really want to move it. 
---
Idk if burn jita is still on but it was and freighters were not safe there. You could also move your stuff to dodixie or amarr to offload it there (that's what i would do tbh.) 
---
The general rule of thumb for not hauling more than it would cost in catalysts/thrashers to gank you is still true.
---
My perspective is not controversial, nor is it "old fashioned." It is, as I noted, literally how every functioning democracy works. And it's not going anywhere, because it's the best system designed for government, bar none. 
---
And no, you can't tell who is representing what based on the minutes. You've been a leader in misinterpreting what has been said and trying to spin it your way. But that makes sense now - I didn't realize your background.

Loot collected covered all our tackle losses....

That would be the best thing for eve at this moment 
---
So I've ran abyssal sites when they first came out, but am by no means any pro at them. Biggest thing is getting the filament right for what you'll be flying. But the NPCs will aggro drones (as you found out), making drone boats more of a hassle. Gila fits are excellent due to missile skills just in case the drones get blapped. I solo in T1 gammas in a caracal, and it does fine with my ok(ish) missile skills.
---
Oh you are right don't want to upset the miners that are literally the source of the aforementioned (super) capital proliferation. lmao
---
8/10
---
so is there even a single person left that works with the community at all?
---
for real. This isn't a super obvious thing that when you click the info from the LP window it shows you a BPO when you are buying a 1 run BPC.
---
Yeah, for sure.  Although, tbf I think CCP always intended for groups to outgrow FW and move on to greener pastures.  I think the bigger problem is that  new groups no longer see FW as a worthwhile place to grow. There used to be a much higher level of turnover.
---
STOP BUBBLING STOP BUBBLING.
---
Pretty quick by ccp standards. 
---
You're not wrong but I definitely feel like I used to get some fights when solo/duo roaming, where people (including some renters) were interested in defending their space with a fun little brawl.
---
I feel like, and this could be nostalgia though I feel it is somewhat true, lately people are more interested in overwhelming force/content denial so they can get back to ratting. Either caps/supers or "just dock up! don't draw attention to our pocket!" kinda of behavior seems even more common now.
---
Which yes, that behavior does maximise your isk income - but literally why play the game then lmao. I can't imagine having pve or mining be the primary focus of my gameplay. But There's all types, I guess.
---
Cyno ramp up or activation time. You know cause theres one on cyno inhibs....

Thanks, and IIRC correctly I had a bunch of gear near dodixie already so that's good to hear.
---
I may be pre-stressing a bit, but I'm almost worried to fly the freighter empty lol.
---
I think I'll hop in as an Alpha account for a week or two again and re-learn wtf I'm even doing and then go from there.  Was just a bit panicked about trying to consolidate all my literal metric f*-tons of stuff to get organized and such.
---
Thanks, and looking forward to getting back in, there really is no other game like it.
---
Democracy is the best system. Your approach to it is old fashioned and will fade.
---
I did not talk much about what's been said in csm summits. Guess it's so hard to believe that a guy thinks space is too safe, game balance is too tilted toward pleb benefits, that the game is too casualized and short term monetized for its own good, that CSM doesn't do much about this due to changes favoring short term null empire interests, that mega empires sink to toxic metagame to suppress all these opinions.
---
So when I try to make space less safe, or make all these issues explicit it's due to my 'background', hatred for goons. If you can refer to my background, you are just another victim of the "us and them" koolaid Aryth and Co has been disseminating last decade. Even mittens admits that much. Watch from 3:55

---
No I'm REEing about caps on subcaps you fucking inbred retard.
---
You could probably pay wingspan to provide protection. They might betray you, but it’s not doing you any good logged off in a safe anyway. 
---
Representative democracy is not old fashioned, nor is it going anywhere. Like I said. 
---
Most of us have argued against space being so safe. The rest of your complaints don't make any sense. 'Pleb benefits?' 'Casualized?'  You're the one accusing us of not taking the point of view of the vast majority of the game, and you're basically arguing against making it more accessible to a broader audience. 
---
My point about your background is if you live in a country with a sunni conservative majority, there's a 99.99% likelihood you're not living in a function democracy, and thus of course you don't believe that folks can represent others and put those others interests before their own. 
---
I don't care about your Grr Gons nonsense. That's just background noise.
---
Fun fact, faces/pictures are far more recognizable than names.
---
What is dead may never die
---
Then without a CSM the only contact with the player base would be people bitching on reddit which I don't think would turn out well.
---
That isn't something Wingspan does they'll find a hole for you for a fee but after that you're on your own.
---
WiNGSPAN does not provide protection detail services only munitions delivery services. However, our word is our bond, we do not betray our word, it is one of the basic tenets of Customer Service V.

---
Actually a titan is in the SUPER CAPITAL CLASS. 
---
Ok, joining a big null sec Corp can be very dangerous to your eve experience. If you enjoy hunting small gang/solo being in a big null block can ruin your experience.
---
What I mean by that is big null blocs are super good for casual players since they spoonfeed everything, everything is done for you, logistics, fleets, search for content, finding optimal ways for pve. 
---
A lot of people like that, for others this ruins the experience since you tend to get „fat“ and lazy and it’s not always easy leaving those groups once you in them because you are I vested asset wise and on a personal level.

It wasnt about changes it was about defense meta, noone was condensed under a supercap umbrella, goons in the north had 8 regions, staged im deklein, you dropped something in tenal? Unless razor could fend u off it was dead. Now you have thousands of people living in one region only, geminate/delve/esoteria/deklein try some shit in any of these regions and u get 50caps minimum. But thats not the case for most space, not for rest of south provi catch impass not for any region in drones etc. Its population condensity that changed

High sec ganking is still a thing, not hauling a huge amount at a time is still a good ideal.  Or just setup courier contracts with a nice collateral and let someone else take the risk.  Worst case scenario you end up with some isk instead of your stuff.

Ancient Romans had representative democracy. It has changed a lot since then, for the better. You can't invoke virtues of a 2500 year old system to justify your misguided take on it. It used to be the case that only rich landowners could vote. Todays problem is the elected bodies constantly overrepresenting certain bsckgrounds. There will always be room for betterment for representative democracies. And there will always be people like you resisting change either due to self interest or a lack of empathy for the "other" classes. That doesnt mean much. History progressed for the better.
---
The issue is even deeper in Eve. You pretty much can't invoke anything about representative democracy in an election with 10% turnout. That's just a system where organized people will exploit. You will tell others to get organized, this is no different than telling blacks to get rich before getting represented, or telling common folk to own land before being able to vote.
---
The majority of Eve are now plebs but it used to be not that way before CCP catered to that playstyle. Eve is a niche game that's supposed to be a harsh universe. The game loses its niche then there is nothing distinguishing it from wow, except wow is much better in catering for plebs.

Your last paragraph is plain racism btw. Someone's country does not determine how knowledgeable they are on the values of democracy and how a democracy should look like. There is even an argument to be made there that people living in opressive countries fighting against those practices should know much better than a self interested republican about how a proper democracy should look like. You will get away with your racism as it will be buried deep inside a comment tree in a forum full with your supporters, but fuck you for saying that.

So zkill now says 2 of 'em are dead, so I guess only 2 left in the game?

Nice catch Fredrick as usual - knew i have always been afraid of asteros for a reason

HI I AM SO HAPPY YOU REPLIDE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHAT! 
---
Buy a raitaru for 600 mil and drop it in a wh. Now you have a home. The Wormbro guys have a network of freeports you might can look into as well.
---
Join a corp though, it spreads the burdens out.
---
there's 3 dead, but the first one that died died like idk 13 years ago
---
**no**
---
Yeah, that sounds about right, and the contract idea might be a good way to go.  Just logged in to both "main" toons, and have some pricey (to me, who hasn't played in a while, but would suck to lose) stuff in Jita-like places.
---
Looks like I can't even fly most of my ships unless I pony up for "OMEGA", so maybe I'll fly the cheap stuff around to get back in the groove and contract out the stuff it would suck to lose just because I'm out of the meta.
---
Haven’t heard about Zkill having issues like that before, it’s a pretty darn good website that does most of its work through Eve O’s API systems. Considering that even the best players get VonHoled, it’s real. 
---
“Hey look at me”
---
Well said, the 'recreation' of this ship brings great shame to the Amarrian people. Amarr Victor!
---
I mean, obviously you can't completely safeguard yourself from ganks but atleast for most people living in wormholes is does make sense to buy leshaks etc due to the increased isk/hour because of the higher dps. Dreads are a couple of bill a piece and most people commit 3 at a time to a site but the increased isk/hour more than makes up for it granted that you don't die imediately. That exact same thing applies to carrier ratting vs vni ratting.
---
It's real. The old method was that eve-kill didn't require API so you could just create a fake mail in notepad or on sisi. Every kill on zkill is verified now since that avenue is long gone. 
---
BUT! BUT! BUT..... YOUR NO FUN! BY THE WAY THE LOCATION IS CLESIST TO WHAT EVER IT IS SAY YOU FIGHT 4K OFF THE STAR! IT SHOWS UP YOU AT THE STAR! 
---
HA! HA! NO ONE WANTS TO CHAT! FINE I GO TO SLEEP AND CRY IN MY PILLOW AND HOPE TOMORROW I GET LET OUT OF THE BASEMENT FOR THIS MONTH FOR A FEW HOURS! HA HA BETTER THAN YOU!

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

It served its purpose.  There's only one guy still mad about T20, and he only rants about it between spoons of nurse fed oatmeal at the nursing home.

Hot sexy supers in your area
---
Wait. 500bil exploration frigate? How crazy
---
Yeah the original one died long ago. But then in 2016 they released 4 more to the amarr champs. Which of those 4, two died according to zkill, so that means only two left?
---
f
---
Its not really an exploration frigate -- check the stats ingame and compare to the regular magnate
---
One can only wonder if the Mittani is moving his pawns around in such a way as he prepares to backstab the initiative, presumably for their failure in the North against Panfam in this current campaign. This would not surprise this avid observer. Amarr Victor!

The color of someone's portrait is easier for me to recognize than their name. 
---
How's the scaling on that vindicator/leshak setup? Seems super skill intensive to me, it's kind of a big part of why i like the nestor/vni setup is that vnis are super cheap and easy to get a bunch of people in on for more dps. Once you have a handful of nestor pilots you can just keep piling on the vnis (well obviously not endlessly, i think that things could probably get messy once you need a third drone bunny.)
---
As someone out of the loop, can you explain VonHole?
---
It was at the party at the end of a Fanfest. 
---
He is going to need it because he is going to play the game from our end... if he doesn't find it toxic and needs to HTFU.
---
There is a chance too of having better overall client performance. It really depends on the code, the compiler and the optimizations used during the compilation process, but 64 bits CPU have more internal registers (the fastest memory storage) and the compiler can make use of them, avoiding in some cases request to slower memory such the cache or RAM.

ahem: walla.

Jeveassets will hook up to the API, and download what you have. The stockpile function just will let you compare what you need, with what you have, and give you a list of what you need to buy/make

You know that PA's South Korean, right? Tiny difference between China and South Korea.

It'd be _possible_ for them to track individual votes. But that'd be by having a unique ballot per person. (there's enough room at the end of the ballot to allow for some tracking.)
---
They're not doing that. It would be incredibly easy to detect, as the ballots are released (aggregated)
---

Fuck anyone too much of a pubbie to handle CODE.

They are a much needed filter. Sort the chaff from the wheat.

AAR: I was sharking around Black Rise/Placid solo chilling while waiting for other alliance dudes to log on. I saw a Thorax on gate and figured I'd poke him. Ninja pointed him and warped to a ping, warped back down and started to engage. He eventually redboxed me and I started wearing him down. In retrospect, I should have noticed how thick he was, because it was taking way too long for me to get through his armor.
---
I had done the same thing the previous night with a Hecate, and these guys noticed, so they knew this bait would work. 
---
Anyhow, two Asteros decloaked about 5km off of me - I had my camera on the Thorax, so it took me an extra second to try to burn away. They scrammed and (multiple) webbed me and even after dropping my Quafe Zero and Overclocker I was only going ~350ms with my AB overheated. They held me for a few seconds, lit the cyno, I said my to wife "I'm losing the Gold Magnate," and started to think about this write up.

'controlling'.
---
if, for example, wormholers had, instead of running multiple candidates, with no cross voting, had run a slate of candidates, who got ordered in whatever order an individual voter had preferred, they'd likely have got a representative.
---
By not doing so, they diluted their votes, and they were eliminated. (the votes not falling through to the candidates with wider support.)
---
Ditto for any other area. STV allows for the elimination of dilution of votes between candidates. But only if the voters use it.
---
You could consider joining WiNGSPAN. Most of us operate in wormhole space and do solo pvp - I mean munitions deliveries - except when it’s too much to solo; then we call in reinforcements. That’s the mainstay of our playstyle but we do plenty of other shenanigans - structure bashes, blops, null and low sec small-gang fleets from time to time, to name a few. I had been in large and small corps before WiNGSPAN, and our size and playstyle has been ideal for me. I wouldn’t necessarily characterize us as “casual” but it sounds like it might suit you.
---
AAR:
---
We were baiting some random blops on a free astero when a Gold Magnate vs Thorax brawl was noticed. I didnt want to kill a not-blops at first, but friends were shouting mad on comms. We quickly logged in 2nd astero bait to light cyno at 100, so carriers would be safe. Gold Magnate tackled, cyno up, kill secured.
---
Actual AAR:
---
My friends do some some small scale pvp, they were working on route for the next day. Conoco guys seemed to be an interesting target, so zkb analysis was done. We saw a Gold Magnate actively hunting at that area last several days in a row, so decided to give it a try. Bait prepared, Asteros ready, target comes to the system and engages. Hands shaking intensifies, decloak-tackle-cyno up-loot the wreck.
---
It usually takes days to spot and catch a suitable target, but this time it happened in literally 5-6 hours, still can not believe heh.
---
Mad props for undocking ^^
---
yeah I can see you've only ever been on one side of this equation 
---
Voilà. I've heard too many people saying walla instead. Or writing it.
---
Omg this one went right over my head. Wow. I wonder if I'd seen it before and just never made the connection. 
---
Thanks...was just talking about gold and silver Magnates in the Rookie Help channel, and then 20 minutes later someone comes in and posts the kill mail. I haven't played since 2013, and I've logged in about 4 times in the past couple of weeks. I'm pretty sure this is the biggest coincidence of my life.
---
CCP Guard has been the most recognizable outward face of the company ever since he was still a GM.  I dare you to provide evidence that he was let go for anything.  I understand that you are all doom and gloom (Bring out your dead! *bang bang*  Bring out your dead!), but let us remember, others flat out stated that their leaving was not of their own accord.  Companies let people state they were let go.
---
This happening also did not just happen.  The decision was made prior to the CSM Summit.  He told them personally while there.  
---
There is nothing out there that even hints that he was fired.

Yeah so did the industry window so I though there was more to it that benefitted a bunch of extra steps to get the same info. I see its a benefit if you want to check multiple manufacturing locations for bit and bobs at the same time, otherwise it seems redundant then.
---
It's a rare ship awarded long ago only 5 were released 3 of which so far have eaten a bag of dicks
---
You will also find similar responses when it comes to players or groups that grief player testers.
---
Support tickets or forum threads will have the same copy/paste replies. They just dont have a support team anymore to handle it.
---
I've submitted big reports that never got resolved and still made it to Live server side (client resets periodically to high graphics.even when in potato mode), granted it finally got fixed after it made it to live server and others reported it
---
Nice drop on our panther the other day, by the way. Dude mentioned he had an astero dropped on him and I instantly knew it was you. :P
---
Hey man, just wanted to give you some help on getting back to hisec if you want to start off slow again. First, you can change your death/medical clone back to your starting system in hisec (wherever your character was "born"). This is done by being docked in a station and clicking the "clone bay" button. This should bring up a small screen with 3 options. One of these options should allow you to change your death clone. You can change it to the "current station you are sitting in" or you can change it to your "home/school station".
---
After you re-familiarize yourself with the area, you can probably try to start finding a corp to join.
---
Don't worry too much about the Raven or the Scorpion. ECM got nerfed recently, so the Scorpion isn't much good anymore for that, and the Raven is just sort of off-meta. Not terrible or anything, just not great. Depending on how they're fit, they're probably worth a maybe a couple hundred million between 2 the of them.
---
Also just to give you an idea about the scale of isk at present time, the average nullseccer can make about 10-15 million every 20 minutes before corp taxes using a mostly afk Vexor Navy Issue fit. A t1 frigate fit with t2 modules is about 10 million isk. A t2 frigate fit with t2 modules is about 50-70 million isk.
---
zkillboard.com is the current killboard website, evemarketer.com and evepraisal.com are the current tools for getting prices. Pyfa is a downloadable fitting tool. The Eve University wiki taught me a lot (wiki.eveuniversity.org).
---
Jita is the main hisec market hub. Amarr has some life. Dodixie, Hek, and Rens exist but are mostly afterthoughts.
---
Goons are the biggest group in nullsec. NC + Panfam (Northern Coalition, Pandemic Legion, Pandemic Horde) are their rivals. Other big players are Legacy (TEST, Brave, others), Guardians of the Galaxy, and Fraternity.
---
Delonewolf is good for random Eve stuff, but I think eveiseasy (Suitonia in-game name) is actually more useful in terms of Eve pvp combat.
---
Anyway, welcome back my dude.
---
Trust me. They're the biggest benefit you can put on a mission running Cerb. 
---
Are you some shitty Stainguy knock off/parody account ? 
---
Unlikely, look through freddie's killboard you should see the pattern quickly.
---
Not your place to tell someone how to play the game they pay for. Sorry mate. Until CCP fixes it, they have the risk... not you. Move on.
---
are they mirroring tranq before/after testing?
---
But the world is flat and there is only 1 region in Eve
---
Yikes. Props to him, that's dedication and quite a payoff.
---
He flew that thing all the time, solo, roaming. Big fucking balls. Cool fucking guy.  
---
But the coolest thing about it, in my humble opinion, was how well he handled it. Stayed on, talked about it on coms, even got in a cepter and pointed a few things later the same night.  
---
RIP
---
o7  
---
P.S. someone rich needs to buy him more AT ships so the game will actually have pilots willing to fly them well, PvP with them, and be willing to lose them.
---
Look at CCP Guard, Growing :)
---
Where do I start? Its full of null players form a particular alliance. Everything they do is for their gameplay/meta and they shit on other people’s gameplay. Don’t have to take my word for it either. Wormhole alliance are no where near what they use to be and same goes for lowsec (left because dead gameplay). Now they are killing off hi sec gameplay while politically covering it up as “cheese” gamestyle. Yet the worst thing for hisec is ganking. CSM doesn’t want to touch it with a stick. Simply because removing it takes their “supporters” content (burn jita, code, ect). CSM is cancer due to it being used for a certain alliance meta gameplay. Null is now the isk fountain of eve. Spamming capitals, rorq mining with untouchable umbrellas, removed interdiction nullification from interceptors (as that was your only option to go in and get a quick kill, other than clokie camping with several alts). I look back on what eve was in 2008 and look at it now. Anomalies where only spawned on reset, Mining was done in belts, super and titans where extremely rare, Content was all over eve. To this stagnant gameplay brought to us by the “players” voice of eve. Think its safe to say “meta plant” voice of eve.
---
and it's worth a lot more than 500bil
---
It doesn't take many people to have a huge number of botting VNI alts. If you see a ton of them, it's likely only a few actual humans doing it.
---
Of your own alliance, Dorkness?
---
Aww the friendship got stuck in a bubble. 
---
Props for Ballz
---
Yeah I'd like some sauce as well, this is just a statement with no backup and no one from the Bastion to speak about it.
---
The Molok that went down in X47 is a good example of how to use one. If you're going in, go in!
---
I think it's worse when one dies and its alliance decides to sit there and watch it die. It shows a lack of commitment to the members, even if the pilot did make a really stupid decision to get it in the position it was in.
---
I mean there's obviously a threshold there where you can't do anything about it, but consider when Panfam dropped a hundred something faxes to save Cormack when Goons dreadbombed it.
---

The Fountain Transition
---
PVE Section
---
It will take some time to move people around and get everything ready. Here is the initial  information.
---
Where can The Bastion rat and mine in Fountain right now?
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Fountain/ATQ-QS,1-5GBW,C-FER9,F2-2C3,Phoenix,Hydra,R-BGSU#const
---
Where can The Bastion run exploration sites in Fountain right now?
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Fountain/ATQ-QS,1-5GBW,C-FER9,F2-2C3,O-PNSN,Basilisk,Phoenix,Hydra,R-BGSU#const
---
Why is F-88PJ not on that list?
---
We are giving the renters a month to wind down their affairs and move out. You can enter the system to look at it, to chase hostiles, to make bookmarks, to run escalations, but don’t otherwise rat, mine or run exploration sites. Be prepared to show an escalation if asked. We will add F-88PJ to the list on April 1.
---
What about other systems marked DUTCH?
---
Please don’t rat or mine in any of our rental territory. You can pass through, you can PVP, you can scout, you can make bookmarks, you can scan down wormholes, but do not hang out cloaked, don’t rat, don’t mine, and don’t do exploration sites.
---
Timelines
---
When can we start moving in?
---
You can start moving in now. Travel in fleets. Do not move yourself. Assume hostiles have this document.
---
When do we have to be moved?
---
We are looking to see most active PVP and PVE characters moved by first of April. We expect utility characters to move around a lot and their location doesn’t mean very much overall.
---
When we do move structures?
---
Don’t worry about structures. Don’t take any down. Don’t plan to put any up. If you want a structure for vanity reasons or for a corporation project, consider putting an Astrahus or Fortizar in D-Q04X as your project. If something is missing in Skaven or R-BGSU, please contact Halfirien via Discord with your suggestion/request/need.
---
PVP Section
---
Do we have a ratting/mining protection fleet like Theta Squad?
---
That function is being set up right now under Darien Avan. If you can help FC those fleets, please offer him your help. Please bring your faxes and find a comfortable tether spot on the outside of the Keepstar to be ready.   Faxes &gt; Carriers/Heavy Interdictors/Interdictors &gt; Dreadnoughts/Combat Rorquals &gt; Bridge Titan &gt; other
---
Can we use our combat supercapitals on our Theta-style protection fleets?
---
Please do not bring your supercapitals. We will need a bridge Titan, but otherwise stick to capitals and subcapitals. The hostiles are very good at bait traps and our supercapitals are not worth risking for someone’s capital ship. If a Titan is tackled, we can consider escalation.
---
Where will fleets be forming?
---
The Bastion FCs can call fleets from 1DQ1-A or O-PNSN or both (dual form-up). There will be some protection fleets, PVP fleets, move-ops, rescue fleets, and more. Expect some potential assistance fleets for INIT or LAWN as well right now. Always expect surprise wormholes.
---
Where should our capital fleet be?
---
See #Big channel. If you are not a member of Big, please apply here: https://rampart.thebastion.info/groups/6/apply
---
Tell us which capitals you have in your application.
---
Where should our supercapital fleet be?
---
See #Bigger channel. If you are not a member of Bigger, please apply here: https://rampart.thebastion.info/groups/7/apply
---
Tell us which supercapitals you have in your application.
---
Are The Bastion’s fleet doctrines changing?
---
Yes. Stay tuned for more information coming from our Skyteam.
---
Miscellaneous Section
---
What else is changing?
---
We are making changes to the rental program to make it easier to manage, to improve the quality of life of the renters, and to increase The Bastion’s confidence in the integrity of the program.
---
What are we doing about The Bastion feeder corps?
---
This is under further discussion and will be clarified.

Bastion has no problem with imperium rules... 
---
If you're implying that TEST just let the Komodo die then I hope you enjoy the kool-aid. We certainly yelled at him -- I know I did so very loudly -- but we also tried to bump him back to the gate. Logi was out of position, he was dead as soon as the enemy cyno'ed in.
---
Okay then, so this entire thread is bullshit then, right?
---
I mean in general, not the Komodo specifically. For titans, supers, the works, not just the rare faction stuff.
---
I wasn't there when the Komodo died, I can't speak for how support may or may not have been involved.
---
wow so now I've heard the 2 extremes in the same reddit thread people who say that the CSM has complete control over pretty much everything CCP does and others that say CCP doesn't take the CSM at all seriously.
---
Well they do exist [kind of](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=18642&amp;debug=1)
---
Ah, my bad, I read that as a dig.
---
There can be only none?
---
A few things I just dont understand about the leet PvP small gang peeps mentality when they come into a groups home region where thousands of players live wanting good fights and complain about how its so unfair it is that you got blobbed by bigger and better ships, and  waaaaa they are organised and have a defence fleet.
---
waaaa they wont give me content
---
the big prey on the small.....its nature
---
If no caps what do our vets do and our newbies train and wish for?
---
And here is my greatest achievement. A 64 assed monkey!
---
&gt;Thorax
---
&gt;I should have noticed how thick he was
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
God damn bubbles. 
---
It allows the game client to address  more memory that's it. It will potentially perform better but that's it.
---
Did it make you feel powerful and tough to yell at someone on the internet for a few minutes?
---
I downvote everyone who complains about downvotes. No exceptions. 
---
Puts a komodo kill to shame tbh but not as many people will care. Odd.
---
Doesn't work that way.
---
Can confirm he is a mad man and has been pvping with that ship for ages. I fought him with no success more then once ;)
---
You missed the best bit:
---
&gt; PVE should be in Fountain with the rest of the team. If The Bastion is not your team, dock up, drop corp, and begin researching another team.
---
- Carneros
---
I'm not at all happy about this and would love to know the reasoning.
---
Not since 15 
---
Not looking forward to saving Bastion's shit all the time.
---
Eve is just going to become a mining sim since roquals don't break and just spawn supers 
---
Why would Mittens backstab us? We deepthroat him on the daily.
---
Good luck.
---
just don't then lmao
---
too bad this is probably dumb bait for dumb people
---
Ships are ammo, and should be considered lost on undock. 
---
who tf is Conerose
---
well shit, I forgot their nip expires in 3 weeks
---
I wasn't complaining about downvotes.  I was pointing out that people were downvoting someone for misunderstanding what a BPC was because when they click show info it shows the info of a BPO.
---
&gt; As the dustclouds that billowed out of the crater cleared, CCP Falcon stood ten feet tall.
---
Falcon stood 10ft tall??? 
---
Kills are kills. 
---
Man if you actually think that Mittens would backstab allies for failing or incompetence you really haven't payed attention to the cfc, like ever.
---
Shut up, Paint.
---
Were any of these ever sold by the 2016 winners?
---
Back to botting ;)
---
I can finally get rid of my spreadsheet that tracks which characters are on which account.
---
Its almost like there are 30,000 rorqual alts in delve and Imperium needs space to stretch its legs...
---
Those girthy Thoraxes can be a pain
---
its full of burner runners. just a shit fuck ton of them. 
---
You will still be able to play with dx11, the only part of the client getting phased out is dx9. 
---
:honk:
---
-- End transmission --
---
second this \^
---
Also, never trust anything or anyone. If it looks too good to be true, its a scam. If you think you can win a fight, you cant, you are being baited. Don't leave high-sec and expect to live, consider yourself dead on the first jump out.
---
Take your time, do the tutorials, join a noob corp and learn the ropes, and back to step one, never undock in anything you cant afford to lose, even in high sec
---
CCP isn’t braindead. Im sure they can figure out majority of the stuff CSM trys to push thru is bias. So of course they wont take them seriously. The stuff they do push thru is completely garbage. If the CSM truly was in it for the community, they would start pushing to reduce the current cancer in game. And push to make other gameplay specifically not in null more attractive again. First thing i would do is adjust the risk vs rewards in null. Its broken! Its extremely lucrative with little risk involved. I would also make wormhole better off isk wise then nullsec and bring a nice isk concept to lowsec. I would also bring a mechanic where wormholers could bring the effect of their WH to null sec for 2hours. I would out stipulation like “must have cit in WH and player must be in WH for 24hrs. Effect becomes active upon jumping into a null WH. Effect reset timer depends on how long the players is out of the x WH. Something like jump fatigue”. Yet this goes against safe factor in null so that idea will be frowned upon. As for HS I would leave majority of the new meta alone. I would remove ganking from .8-1 systems. I would increase lvl 4 rewards and have them only in .5-.6 systems. I would also have HS incursion only spawn in these systems.
---
Thanks man :) 
---
wait, guard is leaving???
---
Flairbaited I’m afraid my man, I made this account to take the piss during the war last year.
---
Only half-mast, could still use some more fluffing if you're free.
---
I’d recommend joining an established corp to learn the tools of the trade before going solo.
---
Define solo. Like you by yourself or you with alts?
---
Cause if you know what you’re doing you can gain unassailable wealth. But odds are you’ll listen to reddit, not join an established corp and complain when others bash your shiny citadel you didn’t need.
---
If you’re a poorfag, C13s in confessors are the way to go. From there you inject straight to C5 wormholes with a naglfar &amp; some alts to scan and huff gas with. 
---
Then just surf the C5/C6 highway of riches like a nomad. 
---
[C6 how to a corpy made ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJhOyk0yh5YuWFZlzuh-0C8U5J6YT_pid) for a general overview. But TBH. I think that C5’s are easier to go unnoticed.

Nothing racist about pointing out that you’re criticizing a system you have no direct knowledge of. I don’t even know what race you are, simply that you don’t live in a country with a functioning democracy. Reading about it in a book is far different from living with it, functioning in it, especially the kind of experience I have. You don’t have that, so don’t talk to me about democracy like you’re my peer. You’re the equivalent of a third grader trying to lecture a P.h.D. 
---
You keep quoting this “10% turnout” number but you have no way to back up the claim. Regardless, the size of the turn out doesn’t matter. The fact that the entire player base with an active subscription can vote makes it democratic, whether they choose to exercise the vote or not. That many don’t means many simply don’t care. That’s a completely valid choice and means nothing about whether the system is democratic or not. You can have 99.97’5 turnout in North Korean “elections” and clearly not have a functioning democracy. 
---
American turnout in presidential cycles is generally over 60%, with 40% during off years, although the 2018 cycle saw 50% turnout. That’s not because ‘the rich class’ want it that way, it’s because - as with EVE - many people simply don’t care who is in charge or who is representing them. What you don’t understand about American politics could fill the Grand Canyon. 
---
The idea that by making the game more accessible to people it’s becoming no different from WOW is one of the more idiotic things you’ve ever said, and that’s saying a lot. 
---
Level headed post. At this stage, people would rather have the unknown alternative as its a better gamble than the current system. At least the alternative wouldn’t support one side. Everyone gets fucked instead of certain groups.
---
I love how you needed 3 carriers to kill it.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
How much would you say?
---
Then you go hire a PR company to do focus groups and survey testing with your players and that costs 200k a year. 
---
The CSM is a steal for CCP. 
---
No - it’s just reddit being reddit. 
---
Right click everything.
---
Join brave newbies or pandemic horde
---
Find a corp you like, it’s okay to try out different ones. And find something you like to do on a daily basis, Eve is huge, you’ll try everything in time, so don’t rush it either.
---
Eh, there have been bugs that have presented faction ship BPOs, but they haven't stuck around for long.
---
good kill,test is shit.
---
The industry window only shows the material in one specific location for one blueprint for one character.
---
jEveAssets allows me to see what I need for multiple stockpiles in any assortment of locations across all my characters. IMHO, that is very helpful.
---
Unless you fully scan the chain. The issue would be not being able to recognize pvp corps for the danger they are.
---
The reason nobody wants to touch ganking is that ganking is literally the last thing in highsec that makes it at all dangerous. Taking that away, especially after fixing war decs, would be so fundamentally anti-EVE that it’s hilarious anybody would actively advocate for it while complaining about other things that changed the game. 
---
We are actively trying to make null riskier. You have zero idea what you’re talking about. 
---
It's not about that comp. I mean that in general. It doesn't matter if we go out in a cancer nano gang or if we go out in Stabbers you just don't get small gang vs small gang anymore. You get one of three things in most scenarios: 1) They bring an 80man fleet 2) They drop (Super-)Caps on you 3) They dock up and don't fight you at all.
---
Considering there were 3 before today and now there's only 2. Probably at least a 50% increase?
---
i don't think he meant invulnerably but just the ability to tank more while Stuck.  
---
because invulnerably states are shit.

Trust no one.

Everything is KOS in wormholes. If you’re not interested in violence you’re better off elsewhere. The best of friends frequently slaughter each other in wormholes. Everyone has multiple cloaked accounts and sabres. 
---
The best place to jump into wormholes from K-Space is lowsec IMO. Tons of holes from k to k space and not many people using them for routes.
---
hes gettin lazy both asteros on this kill were very burned! :) 
---
Whatever someone will pay for it
---
You can't put a value on a rare ship that there are only two left of. 
---
T1 Cruiser balance was the best, get your facts straight. Fleets of thorax, ruptures, caracals and moas bashing each other in the face, oh it was glorious days.
---
As a recently returned player myself, do you happen to know any in-game collectors? I have a few "legacy fit" ships.
---
The wormholers guide to riches:
---
Save up 1bil of blueloot and put it in amarr.
---
Then Every isk I make 
---
15% goes to PVP ship, 15% goes to PVE ships, 15% goes to Investments. And 55% gets spent on skill injectors/ Plex for more alts.
---
Time of limiting capital ships by SP gate passed long ago.
---
We need to limit capital viability by material/ ISK cost.
---
And yes, instant travel needs a nerf.
---
nah, that was pre module tiericide dude
---
during svipuls online there were non-caracal small bloc cruiser fleets all over the place, links were fixed, and nearly everything was viable
---
Farewell friend.
---
Beep?
---
Especially politicians.
---
If we get to a point where dropping blops is better than dropping carrier/fax blob, we live in a glorious future.
---
Nerfing instant travel would be glorious, but if weak ass battleships are superior to carriers vs subcaps, we are already on the right track.
---
Awww it's just a Gold Magnate, I've seen it everywhere...

Averse to pvp?
---
You don't need to buy omega immediately, I've been playing on an alpha account since october an I'm still hooked. Omega accounts are nice though, and I am considering plexing.
---
Well, we are casual in the sense that our only requirements are having decent skills to fly at  least one covops ship (dosen't matter which one), and Customer Service V, which basically means that you need to honer your word and don't be a dick. We have no required ops, fleets, or activity levels, and although the roll-play is encouraged, it is by no means a requirement.
---
But actually
---
Trust no one
---
Don't undock a blingy ship that will make you quit the game if you loose it. Ships are expendable in EVE.
---
&gt;he doesn't know about vonhole
---
they gave out the first batch at the first amarr tournament back in like 04, but they had another amarr tournament not too long ago - 16 or 17 i think - and gave out more
---
What!? No! Guard has been the most recognizable face of EVE. The FriendShip will be a bit less jolly. He will be sorely missed.
---
Welcome to fountain bastion
---
&gt; Nothing racist 
---
You assumed that just because I'm from a sunni majority country I must have insufficient knowledge of democracy to talk to you about it. You don't have to talk about the superior race and so on to be a racist. You made an arbitrary distinction between me and someone else you'd have argued, just on the bases of where I am from. Some member of an autocratic country can sufficiently know his representative democracy to talk to you about it. First of all, there are relatively more democratic Sunni countries in the world. Second of all, you can read politics to learn about it. Third of all, you can travel or live in different places to experience their system. 
---
&gt; You don’t have that, so don’t talk to me about democracy like you’re my peer. 
---
It's funny in all your republican arrogance how delusioned you are. First, you think yourself some champion of democracy just because you were block voted in a CSM seat due to block voting. Then you come here, portray me as someone who is arguing against representative democracy, just because I argue against that your idiotic version of it. I just argued that one of the core principles of a functioning democracy is that the elected body should be an approximate representation of the diversity of the voting population with respect to background. It's funny how you demagogued your way from this to claiming I can't understand how democracy is supposed to work. Yeah, I prefer CCP picking their focuc group over a %10 turnout shitshow you call CSM elections. That has NOTHING to do with what I think about RL democracies. But you talk as if I hate democracy due to how incapable I am about grasping its value, because I am from some authoratarian country. 
---
The cherry on top is how you imply you RL involvement in politics puts you in a superior position in all these matters just due to where I am from. I am a Philosophy Ph.D. Given your words so far, I know what representative democracy is supposed to be much better than you. I know your job as well. People in your business are destroying American democracy, not building it up. Stop kidding yourself. If anything, you are not my peer.
---
&gt; You keep quoting this “10% turnout” number but you have no way to back up the claim. Regardless, the size of the turn out doesn’t matter. 
---
Oh I thought your peers are in the voter suppression business because it mattered. Ofc it matters. If there is low turnout, 
---
&gt; many people simply don’t care who is in charge or who is representing them.
---
Almost as if there are no century-old systemic reasons for why people don't care about who's represented them, which have been woven carefully by the rich elite of the US. It's almost like it's just a coincidence that US has a way lower turnout than most developed countries, particularly of its size.
---
&gt; The idea that by making the game more accessible to people it’s becoming no different from WOW is one of the more idiotic things you’ve ever said, and that’s saying a lot.
---
You simply don't have the finesse in Eve mechanics and ecosystem to even understand what that means. The tragic thing is you're too far into your relevance illusion to even suspect that there is something you're missing here. The idea is not accessibility of the start of the game. There is no one that can argue against NPE improvements or wardec changes etc. The idea is the casualization of the endgame, by pushing people to an asset acquisition path in which they play for the bigger and shinier ship and giving them ultra safe environments in nullsec. CCP pushed people that way because Rorqual multiboxers were an immense short term boost (but is currently imploding) in income, before PA acquisition. Empires push people that way because they need F1 monkeys in titans. If you think of it, it's very WoW. Playing Eve for the bigger asset is just like playing WoW for the next epic item. Except WoW can keep releasing new items and PvE content, whereas Eve's PvE content sucks and it can't keep releasing new ships so there is a 2 year expiration date in their ability to keep people interested in this gameplay.

Pred batphoneing? Inconceivable! But in all seriousness the locals have been working together to try and stop snuff, but without a titan ball of equal or greater size it's a lost cause

Tip 2: There is only one relevant skill in pvp: friendship (have more friends with u, than ur target).

great ending with the 'I appreciate your sacrifice" from Analiese 10/10
---
TFW PL has more kills than nc

Rorqual save fleets are usually boring in my experience. Get in Muninns, go to the dying Rorqual, chase off whatever was killing it.

Yes, couple of hours tops, then your mouse finger aches and your eyes go all squinty! 
---
Generally dicussion in this thread has been a pleasure to read. Yours was less so, but i am going to try and help! I'll try and break down your points for you. And then attempt to provide short answers.
---
You said : hi, interesting post, there are A few things I don't understand.
---
1.Why do small groups come to big groups territory?
---
- likely because like any game larger concentrations of people are more likely to get content faster. I would say for this very specific example their wormhole static randomised where they go, so they aren't picking on a specific group and will go any where there is a chance of content. It does appear that they found this connection and retained it knowing the horde will often use sub caps to protect their territory lending to the possibility of good fights.
---
2. How can a small group expect a good fight if they are in the territory of a big group?
---
- firstly it's a game and no one any where should be exempt from PvP in NS. People make mistakes, people want to fight in various regions, it's the challenge and in eve more than any where a challenge is one of the greatest successes to obtain.
---
3. Why do you think it's unfair that the response is greater than you can handle?
---
I don't think I've read anywhere that people are concerned that a response is a reasonable reaction. I think it's more that it's either dock up, or cyno caps. Rarely is the option a 'let's bring an equal or better sub cap gang to bare'
---
4. We are organised and have a defence fleet, don't you think we are capable of removing you from our territory no matter the nerf?
---
- the primary focus is on two things. That a mining ship should never be a option for soloing a high skilled and expensive PvP gang, and secondly that in most cases the response it caps which are overly flexible in their use.
---
That said, you have likely played other games and seen that sometimes well practiced pvpers can best many times their number due to skill and fit out coupled with experience, so yes... some people are better than you and the FC you follow.
---
5. We are stronger than you, maybe attack
---
 some one smaller?
---
- this is not a great state for the game to be in, and I think you would agree with it being so in with any game.
---
6. Why do you want caps removed?
---
I doubt any argument for caps being removed from the game is well thought out or serious (Or both).
---
Lastly your use of 'reeee' undermines how seriously I could take your argument. Sorry you used waaaaa.
---
x
---
HTFU ya'll... then again :'(
---
Don’t fly what u can’t afford to lose 
---
Init Deploy to hostile space.  
---
TNT Deploy to hostile space.  
---
Goons use sigs and squads to deploy to hostile space.  
---
what does Bation do,   
---
Deploy to their own renter space.  
---
Been in the alliance for a few years, can confirm its a joke, (the alliance that is)but makes for good crabbing without the need for paps.
---
You buy almost anyone an AT ship, they'd be willing to use.
---
Congratulations man
---
back in 2010 i bought about 500,000 contaminated lorentz fluid for about 150 isk each, they are now 390,000 isk each
---
Li3 moving back to fountain? The cycle is complete.
---
&gt;Thousands of Eve Online players are on Geek 2 Geek
---
It's really just one guy, the rest are alts.
---
MASSIVE props to you for having the balls to pvp with it
---
1) Don't spend all your time initially trying to plex your account, you will burn yourself out and have no fun having a 2nd job
---
2) The pvp button is the same thing as the undock button
---
Do Bastion really have feeder corps?
---
I thought that was Jita local?
---
Please advise
---
for an alliance of 3000 unable to break the 40 player mark in an important strat op, all corps are feeder corps .
---
I too would replace marginally competent INIT with The Bastion - the alliance that alliances too bad for the CFC got forcibly combined into.
---
Not at all true. Most of them sit in hangars, never used. Lots are in hangars of people who don't even log on anymore. 
---
To you my sir i must say CONGRATS on using it, to those that killed it we must agree on GJ on plan well focused and executed, this is just what eve is about, planing, using and enjoying.
---
Never Autopilot.
---
Ever.
---
You do know there’s a site in catch that drops a 1b implant that one guy from brave gets up every morning to farm. It’s a infinite spawn too, you can farm the overseer every hour for 50mill isk, it’s in the system 3GD6-8 site called 
---
Rakogh Administration Complex Look it up
---
Oddly enough line members talking about things is not how we derive alliance policy.
---
Fix your overview.
---
Check out r/evejobs. Don't believe everything you read. Do your research. Talk to people before you join them.
---
:frogsiren:     
---
What’s the best way to invest 40b? I’ve tried market pvp but I barely made 3bil in a month. Is there any other ways to make isk with that capital. (Already found t2 Indy and reactions)
---
The issue is that it’s an exploit and is ad should be bannable.
---
Congratulations on finally being dumb enough for me to block you. Grr Goons, Grr White People, Grr Government, Grr anyone who says I'm not experienced enough at everything they are. You belong on /r/iamverysmart with all the other pseudo-intellectual morons. Feel free to get the fuck out at any time.
---
One day they'll learn how to spell too
---
Reps and props for willing to play the game with ships that people only dream of using. If I had a cambian I'd use it in a heart beat and lose it within a week.
---
And those are typically people who either won them or spent their own isk to acquire them.
---
Dunno why people would be salty about this, go make content out of them if you think it's a bad move on their behalf. 
---
Make it exciting by not max pinging unless its something gay like 686528 bombers.
---
wont be much content, many are saying they wont go.
---
r00d
---
Yeah and I am so not looking forward to it. It's badly planned, there is just minimal infrastructure and an absolute non-existing umbrella so save any rorqs or other supercaps. The best thing about it is that Bastion will now rent space from its renter corp. Also Bastion is totally broke but telling everyone "If you then lose supers during stratops or trying to save people in fountain it will be srped". Carneros wants his alliance to be more pvp oriented again and not just krabbing 24/7 but thats the wrong friggin decision he made. It will be a disaster with hundreds of billions lost in the process. Only legitimate FCs are allowed to open up fleets for the umbrella and how many does Bastion really have, 2? All I see is a last deathrattle of the alliance before it inevitably breaks apart because I know that some of the more active corps will do dog shit to move up and risk their shiny stuff in a cage full of tigers without any reasonable protection.
---
this is why I unsubbed
---
It’s risky but, loans. Probably not the best idea in Horde but if you get reasonable collateral and charge interest it’s stupid profitable. 
---
Also 3 bill on 40b per month is 7.5%. That’s decent return on something large scale. It gets harder to keep % return up the more isk you have unless you go to stupid levels of expansion on alts to expand your trading or industry chains. 
---
You could look into setting up capital manufacturing with that capital. 
---
Corporations often have moremembers than active ones.
---
Look into Signal Cartel if you like exploration, and as said, evejobs is the place to look for a new corp
---
&gt;Ganja Labs
---
Aw, shit I remember shooting at their POS because it was too close to my station and was unsightly on my overview years ago.
---
Learn where the F1 key is and don’t do eve solo .. you’ll just die a lot ..
---
Also learn what a “meat shield” is and ask yourself “am I in a Corp that uses me as a meat shield” if the answer is yes.. eject .. as you’re doing it wrong ..
---
but Carneros said red shift will help us they have a lot of pvp experience and are going to be manning the defense fleet. 
---
Hah .. got em.. 
---
couple of days ago we shoot a Rorq with 60 bombers + support ( with focused voids) for 30 minutes and we didnțt even put him in panic. 
---
https://www.signalcartel.com/
---
You mean the experience that caused a super and a titan to get blown up when they tried to save a rorq?
---
[My horse is amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDU7kTdLfF0)
---
I'd pay 700b comfortably for a Gold Magnate
---
so bastion is turning into full blown renters?
---
no your shitty
---
The game is designed so that new comers can contribute from day one.
---
no lie this will make nullsec a lot more interesting, very nice to see
---
(Redshift here)Pretty sure that time was One Man Zerg saving their own rorq and they got gangbanged by 3 fleets I believe. We didn't have numbers on at the time so we couldn't help. Seriously though, we've been in fountain since September, with maybe one dumb moment that cost us one rorq in all these months. If you try even a little bit to not be a retard you'll be fine. Carneros finally made the right call and we might finally find a purpose as an alliance.
---
was hoping for you to triple box all three but sadly thats not case. nice frags. faxes and carriers on grid make whaling easy i guess. Keep it up good video
---
Good for them! 
---
Lets hope INIT makes a new coalition, would make space a bit more fun to have 4 equal power blocs
---
never stop posting
---
Why would you use so many void bombs though? Just alpha through with normal bombs and get a couple bhaals to neut, they work well enough.
---
Was medium wh. no bhaals. We used focused in hope to break his cap and stop boosting. bu he tanked us for 30 minutes 
---
There's 7. Four more were added to the game in 2016 AFAIK.
---
Invite all your friends, some may well end up hating you, some will end up adoring you but most of all You will have more fun with friends.

accurate
---
Hes not wrong though 
---
Actually, truth be told, I rarely get to even press F1 these days, the ship is usually dead before you can say boo, when you're in a 256 person fleet. :P
---
Don't be salty when you get shot at.
---
Pirates usually give advice to newbros (first 2-3 months) if they're not too upset about being shot at - just warp your pod away asap first . 
---
what? Mittens plan has literally always been try to make allies failscade then pick up their leaving corps
---
He's (poorly) referencing Sort Dragons fax spam from a few months ago. Something like 40+ pings straight
---
Not only did you fly it instead of keeping it docked, you solo'd alot.
---
Huge respect.
---
It's hard to call it PvP when no one in PanFam or Dorkness undocks true!
---
It is a good thing though, why would anyone be a member of Bastion instead of Goons? its not like its harder to get into Goons.
---
This way they can actually be something more than B-tier goons, and thats worth it even if they loose a few members and isk on the way
---
Sorry but that information is confidential so can't do.
---
well done for using it! may it rest in peace.
---
Couriers are still absurdly cheap, anything that feels risky can be dragged upto Jita by some other desperate soul.
---
Yeah, it's hard being in Delve with 30,000 other bees. Getting noticed down only happens when we're at war. Gotta stop people from getting bored mining spod you see. Blowing up highsec pubbies is kinda like going on holidays. You get to see a scary exotic location like highsec, shoot a few people and go home drunk and happy. :)
---
Will miss him and his band. Oh well. I wonder if he'll do a leave Eve firesale in Jita too?
---
That's awesome, thanks!
---
Can't believe I agree with you. I feel dirty now :(
---
Yeah I might be too hard but currently it feels like a kick in the nuts especially for members that actively participate in pvp and used delve for a save refuge to get the money for more pvp experiences. I really am not interested in having to fear a drop all time time I am trying to generate money. Also on top of that eu timezone will be useless now since there will be no defensive fleet and i mostly wont be able to wait until us timezone.
---
CCP guard is awesome. I had a blast back in 2012 pub crawl with him!
---
This is the only game I've ever played that gave me cabin fever. Got so bored and frustrated that I sold all my stuff and went back to High Sec. Haven't undocked in months now. 
---
It's worth a few trillion at least
---
Dude, that guy has a fa-... Never mind!
---
thats how you john hartley
---
That's why we just got an entire new region and not go down there, right? 
---
With that title i'd expect some kind of a "butterfly-effect" type  story where a newbie would have at least some small impact on events leading to the big brawl where Komodo died
---
Instead its "look at me, i'm a noob having funin a big alliance" type of post. Which is fine, i just dont like the clickbait.
---
One thing I've never got as a relative newbie - why are they called AT ships, not something like SE ships (for Special Edition)?
---
but explosions don't matter as much if noone gets salty about it
---
Welcome to 4K problems, have a seat and enjoy
---
I hear you. I've taken the "let my sub run out" path myself. The game is frustratingly boring while feeling like a dead end at the same time. Plus I don't have the time available to work this like a second job. Kind of a let down to be honest.
---
Actually well written, clear and helpful. Upvoted.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
Just remember you are free to do and try everything you want to.
---
Also, everything needs time and work to be mastered in Eve, if you are not good at something  it's only because you didn't practiced enough.
---
Last thing, leave hs as quick as you can (like, now)
---
Dont fear, Goons usually also have a protection umbrella in Fountain :D

honestly, it's prety hard

I never knew that Bastion's super group was called "Bigger."  That is an amazing name.
---
They are awards from the Alliance Tournament. AT is just an acronym for Alliance Tournament.

who tf are you?

Other than an illiterate, that is. OP clearly stated Conerose is Bastion's leader.

yeah.....

Meatshield Corp can be really fun if you have good FCs

an entosis ship can now receive remote assistance so entosis fax are less prevalent, but using fax to protect entosis ships is a common tactic

Buying votes for money is why American politics is considered trash.
---
they teach bad habits is my point.. they are also the worst form of sociology in the game when it comes to hierarchy and building on exploration of the games features... "Don't drop that there.. not allowed" ... "The fuck are you to tell me i can't undock a ship like that..." that sort of thing.
---
Aha, I knew there had to be a good reason, just couldn't see it.

Live long and prosper!

Its like CSM sucks but CCP still needs a focus group and we feel like they won't bother anymore instead of implementing a better way.

&gt; I forgot exactly how it happened
---
centipede caliphate and friends had been living in upper tenerifis for a while without being disturbed for the most part, and frat in detorid, with skillu/volta backing up frat in border skirmishes against legacy
---
when drf decided to give up on the east and crash on legacy's couch, they mounted a giant supercap move op that was scouted and pounced on by tri, resulting in a colossal feed of mostly pve supercaps fuil of ships and loot, a devastating blow to xix
---
as a result of this perceived weakness of legacy/xix's eastern front, skillu and frat teamed up with centi and co (what did they call themselves, the garden annoyances coalition? hilaridorable) to start flexing on tenerifis and pointing toward immensea
---
tapi forward deployed to some system on the border of tenerifis in immensea, which is when pl pulled the trigger on full-deploying to tenerifis and the eastern allies started flattening legacy structures in tenerifis and trying to anchor offensive beachheads in immensea
---
the keepstar in 4-gb went down mostly without any resistance, although pgl undocked a jackdaw fleet and fed it almost to a man
---
then ualx was reinforced, which was tapi's forward midpoint keepstar in tenerifis. vily made some phone calls and goon backup was arranged. the keepstar died, and a titan brawl started, with goons gating from delve and ncdotto gating from tribute to join in
---
goons got there first, got about one dd volley off, and the server shit itself completely. the call was made for the eastern allies to not log back in when the node came back up and we got a bit camped in, and although the expected offensive plays from legacy during the camp never came, skillu largely lost their stomach for tidi brawling and decided to bow out. without them, we didn't have the numbers to stay in it, so everybody else largely called it quits too. centi got removed from tenerifis (we WILL return you to your ancestral homeland mark my words) and frat brokered a nip with legacy while they installed xix as residents in tenerifis
---
that nip recently expired which is what precipitated the current conflict
---
&gt;this was shortly after i had enabled 2FA, and was met with the "Authentication Token Mismatch" error.
---
Do note that the token that SISI asks is NOT the token generated by your app. It's the e-mail verification token that gets sent to the email address tied to your account to verify that you're the owner of that address. Back when I did this on SISI, the mail took quite a while to arrive. Like 10mins or so. Do not log off and log in again as it'll just invalidate the token that they're sending you and you'll have to wait those 10mins again.

Don't spend to much time in higsec, it is for alts 
---
2secs to refit one mjd. 4secs to refit the second one 6secs to refit the third one etc
---
That might be why more Nestors get caught in sites than snakes. 
---
I think this all comes down to whether someone is multiboxing or not. As things stand in 2019 most people running c5 sites are doing so solo. They are doing it with 2+ toons most of them with 3 or 4 but plenty doing it with 5+. Yes, Nestors have more utility. When rolled into, speed is better than utility. 
---
Another big plus is the sp requirements. The damage bonus on snakes is on the hull. You don’t need max skills to use them. I think you can run sites with about 3.5m SPs which is why so many people multibox loads of them. 
---
Personally I’ve multiboxed both Nestors and Snakes and would go with the Snakes every time
---
there are passable fleet doctrines for each t3d, and they all to some extent make viable solo or small gang ship
---
what distinguishes them from other ship classes is their combination of mobility (destroyer speed warp/on grid), projection (they all have quite long range), and durability (they are tanky lil fuckers)
---
But why? Eve is so fun game when you play it with others!
---
Must be terrible not living in delve...
---
Pretty pathetic carebear response but ok
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose 10 times over.

Thanks for the recap.

And yeah, my post wasn't entirely serious, especially in the last paragraph, I kind of 'reddit lens'd it
---
This out ranked the Komodo loss pretty quick.... never expected anything to surpass it on zkillboard...
---
Finally ... no ochre first anymore ....
---
those are literally the only two options.......
---
that's an insult to mack though.
---
like if that rule was being followed anyway, cherry pick all the way its the Bastion way, goons copied us.
---
Same tbh
---
Tbf, you can steal them on odd occasion haha.
---
this is just a video game. people will make it sound more complicated than it is, but just remember, it's only a video game.
---
still requires you to either win them or spend your own isk upfront. When that one dude stole tikk's chremoas, he spent ISK to get a whiptail and get in with the dudes.
---
BOOM, LAYWERED
---
From my own experience: eve-uni and google are your friends.
---
Bluemelon...
---
Haven't they been there whelping often? I love Carneros and his Alliance but they seem to feed on fountain regularly. If this move of the whole alliance kinda worries me that if they are able to defend their own assets without feeding. I understand that Goons have fed plenty in the past and the dumbs who aren't in the standing fleet with a cyno but imo fountain seems like the place where supers undock and die.
---
I could be way off base though, if someone cares t ok correct me please do. It's my opinion that since Init is deployed there are less resources to call upon to defend fountain strategic assets. 
---
Did they ever had one?
---
Trust no one.
---
Fly the ships that you enjoy.
---
Learn to fly tackle first, it teaches you A LOT!
---
speaking of stocks tho have you seen twitchstocks?
---
wonder if we could export that and use it for eve, it would make a great companion for r/eve. especially if we could get a ticker in the css...

@mods

Wardecs are a major game feature that was directly contributing to new player retention statistics and was a directly attributable as the cause for many younger players abandoning the game early on. Despite all that, note how long it took them to finally get around to making some positive changes; first with crimewatch, and now with the new latest revisions.
---
The labyrinth is a random deadspace site, whose only relevance is on some small degree of player incoming.
---
I wouldn't even pretend to equate the relevance of the two issues.
---
Why would Init. want to team up with Bastion? The only thing Bastion excel at is feeding.
---
&gt; CCP Falcon stood ten feet tall.
---
That's a bit of a fucking stretch, mate.
---
Are they leaving the imperium or just moving away from the umbrella?
---
I canceled my subscription last year and haven't returned to the game since. I might consider my options once I have access to cloaks again. For now, I'm just casually playing a few hours/week.
---
It makes a difference when you're prepping for multiple jobs at the same time.
---
Where they'll use the same types of materials. If you have 100 Trit, and you have two jobs you want to run, one using 60, and one using 70, using the industry window won't tell you you'll need another 30, until you go to put in the jobs.
---
Really sad to see this, but I guess good luck.
---
How iconic that the idiot stepchildren of the Imperium have to be deployed by April Fool's Day.
---
Not sure why you get downvoted, but CCP repeatedly stated that early contact with PvP and even ganking increase player retention.
---
I mean 30k goons are 4 gates away if you think that makes it vulnerable power to you.
---
One can not vote against 50k bots and SP farmers
---
You are the most whiny arrogant bitch in EvE.
---
Did your uber-1337-nonF1pusher Gang kill that rorqual?
---
Yes, so stop the crying.
---
Did your super-duper-only-the-way-we-play-is-right-gang kill that Mach?  
---
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, because our leader is actually called Carneros.
---
True
---
moron
---
How do you vote against the majority of accounts?
---
Just moving. OP wanted to be dramatic because this is reddit.
---
Cloaking is only for omega players.
---
Most players will kill on sight, but a small minority might warn you in local - either way, never trust anyone. 
---
You don't need a cloak for WH, it just increases your chances of survival and makes a few things much easier. But it sure is possible to survive all that without a cloak, you just need to be good at d-scanning, pay attention all the time and don't make decisions that are too risky. Best way to learn these things and get a feeling for what is worth doing: join a WH corp.
---
Alternatively, trial and error until you get the hang of it ;)
---
And what are the goons rules that they impose in the umbrella anyways?
---
Rorqs are one of the things in eve where wallet tanking actually keeps your ship alive. Investing serious billions on tank makes you go from Bomber bait beta or ceramic chitin chad
---
I thought I hadn't seen any roamers from space violence in fountain. Now I'm sure you never come over here.

This guy is the definition of "good sports".

Took it out like a man, lost it like a man, took it like a man.
---
Big props ...
---
OUCH!
---
won his.
---
For a subcap fleet right? Sure that will help, but what about a cap/supercap fleet that has to wait times on jumps? Will that be enough to save let's say a super carrier against a dread bomb or a rorq vs let's say a bombers fleet? Not to mention the amount of participation from Goons willing to risk their assets to defend someone who is tackled a region over when it could be a lost cause.
---
If you're going to screenshot it, at least post a pic of the results.
---
Not sure I would say that when Lord Maldoror is part of HK
---
Yes, but he also stole part of the PL AT cache before he quit the game.
---
There was also the theft of the Raven State Issue or Megathron Federate Issue (can't remember which), way back which F90OEX gave back to the original owner, ending his career as a trusted 3rd party.
---
calm your tits.
---
yeah as others said it's an email token. 
---
Also the mass test ist on duality, i think.

Lp in plex is really lower than in mission ;/

Maybe you should tell that to your self and stop the whining every time you have to put the slightest effort into a kill.

im just gonna accept that my RULES LAWYER joke was dumb and went over your head and move on from his. I dont wanna keep getting pinged on my phone.

Question about OpSec.
---
So my Corpsmate and I run a casual 2 man Hi Sec carebear, tax dodging corporation.  Last week, he joined up a few of his Alts with a large Null bloc and gave full API's.  Understandable, we are in radical different timezones and he needs to find some people to fly with while I am asleep.  This morning, I notice his Null corp runs a lot of Hi Sec gank camps.
---
So, what do?  I assume I can no longer send any Mailing Lists out with Travel Ship Fits, or announce any loot pinata moves.  Are our Corporation Undock and Safe bookmarks compromised as well?
---
Maybe I *will* have to kill him (in EVE).
---
Dat wishful thinking
---
*So* wishful
---
It should be fixed if it's broken regardles of who uses it, don't you think?
---
If goons enemies make more noise for their activities, just return the favor. It shouldn't become a protected activity because no one complained before.
---
I think a divine power heard our prayers! And moved more targets near our doors! Thank you Oh mighty Angel!
---
P.S. Fcore looking to buy high number of dreds if possible moved to YZ npc stations :)
---
P.S.2 Wanna fight goons? send me a message ingame. 
---
Thats a good boost for the killboard of an alliance who lost nearly 60 supers in under a year. Not even counting the 3 Titans to Space Violence etc.
---
How active is he?
---
They already said they are not taking supers, The rorqs are already dieing in fountain so nothing new.
---
You can only get the original now by running the special t20 commands.
---
Hold my beer...

In unrelated news MCAV is always recruiting people to shit up WH space

I'm amazed you passed up a chance to try to recruit him

get into Exploration before you mine a single asteroid, its gona make you way more isk, let you see way more of the game and probably meet way more people all things essential for new players.

The Main problem of Smallgang E PVP is:  
---
Nullsec is atm at constant War. So Every Coalition is blobbing every Gang to make clear their Space isnt a Playground.
---
Also there are Alliances wo dont Support that. Like Horde:  
---
Horde is not allowed to drop Caps on Smallgangs. If you Roam to Horde Space in Subcaps you will get a Subcap fight. Only Exeption is if you are a goon or goon pet you are not allowed to roam in that space and you can get dropped by caps if player wanna drop.
---
Same Fits also to Brave Space and Provi.
---
If you Smallgang to Delve you will get dropped by titans. If you Roam in Imperium Lowsec you will get dropped by Caps. Thats the current state of EVE :-)
---
yeah give me a should when it stops lagging. I've never even played the game, but I know it lags, in my heart.
---
is it just me or does this guy have a little hint or tone of buthurt in his post, almost like hes in bastion and trying to shame them into not moving cos he does not want to go. 
---
Omg your still around. What a loser. Oddly enough code has died. Peep there blog. They are getting increasingly less content. What a joke.
---
&gt;taught me valuable lessons for work and rl
---
Shit that is true. Reading your post kind of finally made me come to terms how eve got me over my public speaking fears. Also I'm much more adept at handling stressful situations. The anxiety just isn't there anymore.
---
Can see it in the title hard knocks is disbanding no need for the results 
---
Eve has a cruel logic. The truth is that if getting dunked by a 200 person ferox fleet is causing you to leave the game then that's you fucking up, not Eve, not the playerbase.
---
So their sandcastle got knocked over so they are giving up?

Lol elite wormholes amirite

Snuff would like to know your location.

Gross negligence might be a bit strong. While it's regrettable that many have issues accessing Sisi, we still get good attendance at mass tests so they aren't overly impacted. The 2FA issue has been open in our defect tracking system for over a year but has unfortunately not managed to get addressed by the responsible team. Incidentally, the mass test for 64bit today is on Duality, not Sisi, which may not have the same issue for you. 
---
Yup,random screenshot of random forums confirms hk is disbanding. idiots ....
---
To be honest they aren’t going to care about a small high sec alt corp. I’m about 99% sure you’re talking about Goonswarm here and if anything it’s going to mean your friends alt is less likely to be ganked. 
---
I’m not sure who is running the high sec ganking MiniLuv now a days but I think you can be reasonably certain they are combing APIs for targets. They simply scan ships. 
---
I’m not so sure I’d ever move huge amounts in a freighter but I really don’t think you’re at much of a risk here. 
---
To truly complete the cycle you would need to go back to Bastion and ping for them good old Moa fleets again.
---
I thoroughly enjoyed them at the time.

enyos for everybody

he is and so are a lot of the but hurt people here.

No chance, not even the Raven State can sell for that much.

Our support team does not and has not supported the test environment - access is offered as-is and it is updated and maintained by QA analysts and myself. Regarding your comment about defects on test escaping to live, if you'd give me your EBR numbers I would be happy to look into your reports and see if any were mishandled. We do expect each release to have some amount of fallout, we aren't striving for defect-free, so perhaps your expectations of the purpose of the test server is out of line with mine. 
---
And from who am I supposed to rent c6 holes now?
---
Big if true
---
ask in chinese again pls
---
Maybe you in it enough to join Brave?
---
Heavy armor doctrines are fairly common for wormhole corps so sp usually isn't that big of an issue. Leshaks ramping to to 2,5k DPS on the drifter certainly makes it a good chunk faster. Initial leshak DPS before ramp is around 1200 iirc. Vindi is doesnt have the best range by easily does 1500 on stuff that is close. We occationally ude Guardians over nestors because the range is slot Better, so people can burn around the site and apply full dps

You late, capri joined another corp already a few days ago.

About the vote, i bet on B, as everything else will mean they go down to irrelevance

working as intented and perfectly balanced :ok\_hand:

I mean, what's the problem with a mining ship that can easily tank a respectable bomber fleet, completely neutralize a roaming gang and be invulnerable for 7 whole fucking minutes right?   
---
seems legit cause you know, IT'S A CAPITAL SHIP™
---
and nothing of any value was lost, WAIT!
---
Damn, those will be easy rorqual kills
---
What I experienced too, Amarr &amp; Dodixie are good for some buyorders, but if you want to sell bulks its terrible. The traded amount of items is soo much lower than in Jita it hurts and you wont sell anything without fixing orders every few minutes ves. the dedicated Amarr traders (there are still some)

What are the top alliance wars/conflicts and who is winning?

Nice kill and mad props for using it

Out of curiosity. Is Nc  a pet of brave or horde?

Never join a high sec mining corp.

Maybe he has no initiative to join brave

*No* alliance?

Get your permit and you have nothing to worry about.

You can spend it on injecting skills.

I wonder if any of the performance issues/bugs that people fin doing this testing would actually be fixed before being released on TQ as per usual...

CALM YOUR TITS

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

So why did frat kick you guys from Wicked Creek?

Someone did the maths for real money value on that kill?

It makes me happy to see Darien doing things. He's a great dude. Hope everything he's involved in goes well
---
Oh yea, whenever I hear about an alliance moving I get a raging boner, there's always shit left behind. My best run was like 6 Astras and a couple of raitarus in a day.

&gt; ~~1) Have a pulse.~~

Bots don't have a pulse, bro, they have clock ticks.

Even better if three of them would not actually be "bluetrals"
---
Didn’t Hard Knocks die last year?
---
I'm not complaining, I'm still plexing my accounts with cash. Eve is a loose set of rules favoring those who understand to exploit them properly. Space honor has been patched out when Goons killed BoB.
---
If CCP designed the system to be less profitable, I wouldn't consider it. Let's imagine an extractor takes 750k SP to make a Large Skill Injector worth 500k SP. It would cut down the amount of possible monthly extractions and make skillfarming less viable, as the cost and income of the whole operation would hardly break even.
---
I consider INIT goon pets, and goons are living in Delve, so yes.
---
Ah right, but I didn't know how these came into existence. I could expand the list on the IB shuttle, Primae, Echelon and Zephyr, but all of these ships were promo or collector's edition ships and way too abundant to be considered extraordinary.
---
I'm a fan of you, btw.
---
Jesus wept, funny that they dropped you. Props for being a legend and wrecking havoc with it though. 
---
That was glorious, although they got taken away pretty quickly after they started dropping
---
what are you trying to compare here? i haven't even talked about DPS. 
---
consider the utility, passive EHP, support and mobility you get for not even double the cost of a t1 BS.
---
Where i'm at right now my nestor has a few faction mods and costs around 700mil. If i lost it i simply could not run wormhole content period anymore for probably 2-3 weeks in order to replace it. 
---
I can't even begin to imagine if i was stuck inside a wormhole with only my helios and a hecate. It might take me months to earn that much again. That's why it seems so insane to me to put billions worth out there where you could lose everything in a blink of an eye.
---
Running a site a minute faster seems like a bad trade to me for the risk of your entire net worth being burned down in the same amount of time.
---
Sweet! Thanks for sharing this.
---
yes. INIT isn't what it used to be 
---
I thought those commands were disabled about 8 years ago?
---
I was thinking of TEST
---
If you stack 60man in shitty 350dps bombers ...
---
Haha, this is awesome. Love it.
---
Thank you INIT.
---
Are you stupid?
---
Spave Violence is a Imperium SIG.
---
I’m sure this is somehow my fault. 
---
Helios aligns faster, warps faster, has enough calibration for a T2 Hyperspatial, can warp cloaked and 1/3 the price (even less if you use T2 stabs instead.)
---
All that in exchange for a very minor (0.465 AU vs 0.0412 AU) increase in scan deviation (assuming full virtue implants and AQ-710+AR-810 on both.)
---
It's a tall tale to be sure.
---
Yes.
---
ALSO OF COURSE I WROTE THE WRONG CCP DUDE FUCK 
---
You should, because he’s wrong. As usual. 
---
It’s pretty sad how fucked up he is. 
---
Grats, you got the rorq to panic. Now your bhaals get to eat shit from the supers that dropped.
---
Use a scangu
---
Can't you day trip to Fountain?
---
Hard if knocked down. 
---
Consider all your ships as disposable
---
Looting drones from battlefields gives you a surprising amount of isk
---
They've been seeding votes for a year
---
someone  make a ticket so CCP can add a lizard monumet in the system the Komodo burned

If you really trying to find bastion's feeder corps. Look at the corp list. Voila. Feeder corps

Double clicking in space makes you fly that direction

also might be a ruse cruise if they smart, im guessing maybe not smart. 
---
just adapt
---
fast scanning in uterly slow ship .... well what for?
---
Pacifier has bonuses to scan strenth so it will be even faster + it's fast ship
---
They will never do this, as it is their current business model for cashing out. As there are much less logged in Accounts but at the same time much more plexxed PvE-Multiboxes that do not sub with CC, CCP is depending on the cash they make with Extractors. 
---
this...
---
if you want to hate yourself.. sure go for it
---
&gt;s it just me or does this guy have a little hint or tone of buthurt in his post, almost like hes in bastion and trying to shame them into not moving cos he does not want to go.
---
Mar5meca, you are too funny sometimes.

We don't save them currently. Because they "handle it themselves"

Do ice abnormalities always spawn in the same systems? Or do they have a chance of spawning in any system with a reasonable Industry Index?

Like a Phoenix, they have risen to die again

Until the super powers drop supercaps and Titans on every little thing crushing them to nothingness.

Weve been dropped in horde space before. We arent goons or goon pets. We are a neutral entity. There is no "non-capital" space. No matter what anyone says. Every alliance, group and pet uses capitals. Its obvious to anyone that roams outside of major fleets.
---
no one's stopping you, pussy. 
---
Thus the name - Bastion is just a better sounding word for meatshield
---
Biomass in game
---
Well, if the powers split up there will be fewer supers to drop and more to counter with!
---
They aren't in direct range of init supers, oh boy
---
There are plenty of corps out there looking for active players and you count as active. Some of the bigger corps probably want and require more, but there are a lot of corps out there. Every little bit helps.
---
The coolest thing about actually living in a wormhole, is that it's safer and more dangerous at the same time. You'll likely be able to do whatever you want for a long time without anyone messing with you. You can mine in ore anoms or pop moons and mine the ore from those. Just about everything you can do in a WH is profitable as hell. I've recently fallen in love with Gas huffing (mining). The isk isn't amazing, but it is really good and I pretty much do it completely afk. If someone wants to pop one of my ventures, I'm out almost nothing. I also multibox them and have my main sitting overwatch sometimes, and they make pretty good bait.
---
When you get to hunting and PVP, there is nothing comparable to Wormholes. Wormholes is how EVE should be played. Hunting is a a real thing because you aren't popping up in local and you're not going to get blobbed on by completely overwhelming numbers, and super caps and Titans aren't a thing at all 
---
and nothing of value was lost!

If wishes were geckos, I'd be space rich.

Haha fair wasn't sure if you did or not. Figured mention so you could edit 😂
---
I fear if they get picked off 1 by 1 they might be downgraded to "Smaller"
---
Honestly 700 mill isnt too much for a Lot of people. I personally whelped over a bill Worth of ships yesterday trying to PvP. Two sites in my nag will pay that. I think the big difference is the amount of people, we rarely have that many people krabbing at one time (last time i went sub ratting was in my kikimora in a WR along with like 2 nestors a confessor and person triboxing leshak dual Eos) 
---
Think one of the Magnate owners turned down a 1.5T offer last year
---
Imagine trying this hard to be space imnportant
---
No one actually gives a shit about you or your self inflated ego :)

there is even a name for it - Widotting

Scanning T3C gives highest scanning strength iirc.

other then to the next bar after good meetings 
---
They only spawned on specific systems.
---
Just dont. They are so many small WH Corps with pretty active cores that do ALL the WH stuff. Not just dropping cans at safespots.
---
Here's a crazy idea: nerf vni to 100mb drone bandwidth.
---
Gotg FC: lets warp Munnins close to Ham Lokis and carrier fighter blob ^^
---
100m/hr? Are your skills all at minimum level? Because usually from what I hear it's more in the range of 120-150m, with 160+ being possible at max skill+concentration.
---
Hi, while Guard and Soundwave easily man the top places in the list of CCP employees gone, you are not far behind. Hope all is well for you ...
---
Don't suppose we can have a little beacon or monument for this event.  These ships are so rare now that no one has ever seen them.
---
Looks like the War HQ thing is really similar to my idea for wardec changes from last year: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9l9ulf/my\_idea\_for\_war\_dec\_changes\_inspired\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9l9ulf/my_idea_for_war_dec_changes_inspired_by/)
---
For concerns about people exploiting HQ's location my post also covered a way to prevent that if CCP  can afford:
---
&gt;structure must be deployed no more than 10 jumps away from defender's structure, the path to travel via gates between the propaganda structure's staging system and the declared war target structure must not go below the security band of the declared war target structure. (if the war target is in high system then there must be at least 1 pipe leading to structure that doesn't go through low or null, if war target is in low then there must be 1 pipe that doesn't go through null) 
---
So no putting War HQ in null, or FW if the wardec is against a highsec corp.
---
Jump number is up for tweaking as they see fit.
---
The gold magnet isn't an AT ship, though.
---
It was a reward for some role playing tournament hosted by CCP which wasn't the alliance tournament.
---
Does the account associate with the profile after restarting the client because it keeps loosing mine...
---
Im just happy to see macko Upgraded from a sabre to hictor for lowsec adventures :P
---
That's even worse really, shows you have no idea what's going on outside delve and wherever you are deployed.
---
I'll lose as my AT ships as you will give me.
---
Its not the size of your thorax...
---
Never quite recovered from Unassailable Wealth’s Destruction huh? 
---
Psssh geckos only cost 1m isk at Jita...... /s
---
Totally Assailable Wealth 2.0 onlines when?
---
*dying, but i see the point in dyeing and it made me chuckle :)
---
INB4 Bastion feeds and moves back to Delve
---
They were so good, the first time they were challenged they fell apart without a fight.
---
Ah that explains it. Still I'd personally alpha through shields and armor with normal bombs and maybe drop a few voids after the first volleys to shut him down. Also don't overestimate their tank, I have rorq and it's about 2.6m ehp I think with 20k active tank, BUT it's -200% cap and only lasts 3-4 mins with both injectors running. Depending on the response fleet and your support, 60 bombers worth of DPS can really eat through one of these things. Can't remember if focused damage bombs are a thing but they are definitely worth a shot if they exist. Remember that even when fully tanked shield+armor is only about 400-500k of a rorq's ehp. If it's taking hull damage and no response is coming, it will die even if it panics.
---
Why would anyone in their right mind move to fountain to get farmed, instead of staying in delve for dank ticks?
---
What if the flair is no longer bait...
---
Even smaller entity that would be a "lolz newbs with 3 active player here nothing to worry about" corp to bigger group would be a threat to solo player
---
Based on the instant rage downvoting, I would wager that there are some salty people still.

He's an old gay man child who gives titans to his 20 year old boy toys for sexual favors. Aka the leader of bastion.

seriously, nobody would be mad, if yonis lost his Hel it would be gorgeous memeing for days ...
---
As one of the people who challenged rage the first time, you are talking out of your arse.
---
:o
---
See that's the thing eh? I don't think being able to literally burn billions of isk worth of assets on almost nothing is not something "a lot of people" can just do on a regular basis.
---
And i thought that wormholes were supposed to be this amazing utopia of perfect content where you and your friends are always together and making billions. You are telling me now that you can't form a 7 man fleet to run C5 sites and typically go it alone? I do not understand.

should be soon, based on the discord they having a right bitch about it.

That feel when your faction titan is worth less than an under valued Magnate.

Some super salty hk quitter down votes in here.

It's hard to talk alliances without talking coalitions.
---
Goons + INIT + random trash alliances form the Imperium and are clearly able to take every other group one one one. Goons are all about massive numbers, very large industry, SIG groups for small deployement and coalition-wide movement of supers every 6 months to show their massive dick, with a very defensive set up in Delve to protect their hundreds of rorquals and supers. INIT clearly is the quality alliance pushing regular deployment, cool doctrine and generally good spirit.
---
TEST and a whole bunch of random trash alliances form Legacy coalition. TEST are a fine regular open alliance, they are trying to copy Goons in term of super power building and are probably #2 right now, thanks to Goons protecting. They basically are bluetral, and in case of a big war will ally themselves like it happened last summer.
---
NC/PL are probably more or less like INIT right now. They are allied with Pandemic Horde which is a newbro alliance that has grown up a bit now, with supers and shit. PL lost several corps lately. NC content probably rely a bit on their FC, I don't know much about what they are up too except countering TEST / Goons / INIT incursions in their territory. They still have a decent renter group to finance their things.
---
Gotg (Darkness and co) are basically trash tier and are only alive because they payed Goons to stay alive during the last war.
---
Fraternity is a chinese based alliance that is the rising force in the east, they regularly have border friction with TEST and got defeated several time, but are still a big group with a strong chinese TZ so it would be hard to threaten them seriously.
---
Skill urself is another quality alliance in the east, who ate most of the russian empire regions. Unsure what their recruitment standard is and what their main TZ are, you would have to check. AFAIK they are loosely aligned with FRAT and skirmishing with non-TEST Legacy members recently.
---
If you're looking to krab and swing your dick with a super or titan every 6 months, join Goons.
---
If you're looking for active NS PvP you should look at INIT, NC, or skill urself.
---
If you're looking for easy to join alliance that won't collapse in the next 6 months, you should look at Pandemic Horde or TEST.
---
If you enjoy living in trash, join Gotg or non-TEST Legacy.
---
r/fittings is better suited for this
---
As a newbie, I'm trying to understand the mechanics of pvp better.
---
Let's say a ship does an estimated 200 dps. If another ship has an armor rep that repairs 60 hp per second (and cycles every second, for ease), I'm assuming it has the effect of basically reducing the dps from 200 to 140, since 60 of that damage is undoing what the armor rep repaired.
---
Lets also say the defender has 3.5k ehp, and the pilot is afk (though left the armor rep running). Am I then correct is assuming that it will take a ship with 200dps (3500\(200 - 60)) = approx 25 seconds to destroy the ship?
---
Is my understanding of this simplistic scenario correct? 
---
F.  Can confirm, Jalep has big balls.
---
Just seed 2000 ravens
---
\*FCs
---
Have fun, don't let it become a chore or a second job.
---
Eve is just a video game.
---
Wow, my pilot (the main one) is about the same age as yours, but our paths were quite different. I wish i had will to write something similar. :)
---
For two weeks i was running around highsec dying in wormholes and doing security missions. 
---
Then i was recruited to nullsec. And then it all begin, 1000 of programs to install and setup just to be able to talk to anyone and join fleets. Took a few days to get it all somehow working, authorized, etc, etc, etc.... First day being totally terrified to undock in my new home, then flying to our local market and being totally lost because my shitty overview did not show upwell stargates, getting rescued by a corp member for the first time. 
---
But then the game finally opened (would totally have if i had the necessary pilot skills), alliance fleets, federation fleets, baiting the guys that come hunt on our farming grounds (first pvp kill - i was a tackle, ofc), VNI and chill, getting rescued by corp member for the second time, people mining in Rorquals like there was no tomorrow telling me to try mining, trying to mine in a venture, bored to death after like 5 minutes, VNI and chill, making mistakes and letting hunters kill my VNI, more fleets, Rattlesnake (t1 cruises still, so meh, he is just waiting in hangar for me to skill up)
---
And since yesterday, incursions. :) 
---
I probably omitted / did not remember many other things i did.

Pro tips on ganking 
---
Have you discovered Dotlan? It will help for exploration pathing 
---
Tripwire or pathfinder will also help for wormhole exploration 
---
&gt;be a relevant wh corps
---
&gt;decide to stay in WH
---
&gt;suddenly irrelevant because u/capable_BO_Pilot said so on reddit.
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
Third this. Never trust anyone. Not just in EvE,
---
Okay who are you, contact your CEO please so we can talk about your reddit posting
---
We had Noobman and Wingspan in the CSM for multiple years and can you really say anything that Wormholers have pushed for has been achieved ? , Noob would go to the CSM meetings with tonnes of data and notes from round tables to represent our small community. 
---
Things like : 
---
&gt;Noobman brought up requests from lower class wormholes, namely that C4 sites have a
---
&gt;very long distance spawn, and how sometimes hacking doesn't spawn a wave. He also
---
&gt;added a desire to see some more C4 - Null, Null - C4 connections, with smaller mass
---
&gt;wormholes.
---
&gt;Aryth again brought up that a lot of this sounds like wormholes would like to get the
---
&gt;benefits of nullsec, without the relative danger.
---
These things have been talked about for as long as i can remember both in CSM minuets and in both official round tables and the ones that Noobman hosted. 
---
There is a massive wave of disillusionment with both the CSM and CCP in WH space , We feel abandoned and ignored. 
---
Your name sounds like an Alex Meyer alt. Will the mighty "German Starfleet Empire" rise again? XD
---
So you need something in place to let you hold down a rorqual and gather forces, but also denies the enemy from gathering forces while you do this?
---
Is this the first Gold Magnate that has died in PvP? Because the only other one on zkill was self destructed on purpose because its owner won Eve.
---
Thank you, this is really helpful. 
---
I have 220mil+ SP, have competed in old alliance tournaments, and can afford/fly all kinds of caps and supers... which i would like to use but I also want active sub-cap roams. Are goons not big on the sub cap roams? I don't really care for the politics, I just want to find a long-term home that is not going to crumble in the long term (which is probably a tall order)
---
Ok, you right. Based on all of the north, wormholers and high sec war deccers instant down voting. Is that more accurate?
---
Bring literally all the dreks
---
My God. There is someone spying on the Bastion. And they found out an alliance full of super and Titan builders is moving to fountain. 
---
Holy shit. 
---
Str8 dropping the deep state intel here boyo
---
10 sec anchoring time 
---
1000km range would be nice 
---
there's not much of a point in owning a faction titan period tbqh
---
So your rebuttal is to assume I am someone (who I am not), knowing that you can't be sure but still running with it? Meanwhile you don't use your ingame name so there's no way to know who is talking shit for no reason?
---
The real Alex Meyer couldn't form 2 coherent phrases in english btw. Oh and also, shit on him whenever you manage to form alliances of over 1000 in not even a couple of days
---
And the closest CCP Guard ever got to sex.
---
Goons have lots of special interest groups (SIG), which basically can form full fleets when deployed, they use both caps and subcaps regularly. Other SIG specialize in BLOPS for example. I would rather advise you to join INIT rather than Goons, since INIT is pretty strong even on its own so it won't collapse like that, and you will find more quality pilots / FC there, and they use their supers and all as often as Goons if not more.
---
no when i wait out the 7min Panic i already have gathered my forces also and
---
again no you could just cyno in 30 muninns or ass frigs or whatever 1 system over, take the gate, frag the 2 Sabres we have there to defensive bubble, warp down to us and force us off. easy.
---
i only want that someone from ccp looks into mobile cyno inhib anchoring restrictions and tells me that the current attributes are balancedor not
---
CCP isn't keen on the mobile inhib in any iteration, from what I have heard and read. The ability for one side to simply deny the other side from participating is something they are not fond of.
---
Don't fight near a structure.
---
A market story, can't edit the damn title. :(
---
super ratters hate him! learn how this single capsuleer makes 75b/h accepting contracts without leaving jita 4-4
---
&gt; Yes the cyno for the response caps could have been lit away from the structure and basicly anywhere on grid (off grid cyno wouldnt be an issue as we could use defensive bubbles) and it would have lead to the same conclusion for the above scenario but atleast the response caps wouldnt have been in tether range but in some form of a risky situation.
---
fuck you
---
Great video and good relevant comments to go with it. I hope CCP will be able to help resolve this issue soon.  
---
But now for something completely different:  
---
I like how you can see your 2nd account as an insert in your primary window. Is there an app or programm to make this possible?
---
I prefer forming alliances of 300-500 peeps that are not shit at the game and have no blues ... 
---
Highly underrated comment!!!
---
more... last sold on eve official forum 1.5 trillon. zkill price 500b. 
---
Did you actually read the post? 
---
Ill break it down for you, CCPlz rework cyno inhibitor anchorable mechanics on citadel grids. 
---
To be fair it is broken, or massivly in favour or the defender. 
---
No need to rent anymore, you're free.
---
Hard knocks have been around for a long time. Sure in the recent years they didn't have equally strong wh opponent. That wasn't always true 
---
Blasphemy! 🧙‍♀️🔥
---
If Li3 moved back to W-space, *then* the circle would be complete ;)
---
If it's any consolation, killing rorquals is about as much fun.
---
Small scale pvp alliance that was dicking around everyone else in wh space. 🤔
---
We are a PVP alliance, pve is only a means to an end. Sometimes we have 20 people krabbing, but even at that point mass usually isn't the biggest issue. 
---
Doing dreads is just faster, like easily a bill/hour+ in a farmhole meaning you only have to krab a few hours once in a while to pay for everything.
---
My point was that isk is by no means the same value for everyone, and leshaks are considered cheap by most people i know who fly them. It's a pocket dread at 350 mill for the hull. In fact it's actually cheaper than a rattlesnake hull and about the same after you buy the gun, most people just love to bling them. 
---
I get you're from a null corp where it makes sense for you to use VNIs because everyone with a pulse can fly one, but look at it from our perspective. Why would we downgrade to the slower option? It's not like its 1 min per site we are talking about, we are talking about effectively doubling dps. 
---
It's like wondering why people use carriers for ratting when you can use VNIs, they cost more and is a bigger investment in both isk and SP but your income increase makes it worth it in the long run.
---
Hopefully that should shed a bit more light on things from a wormholer perspective
---
Yes I did and used it, was helpful on finding comic signatures
---
A better death then what happened to the other gold Magnate at least
---
I love it. Keep going newbro and I hope you continue to enjoy the game
---
If it's not at the location that it says, it will also specify distance in brackets.
---
Eh?  What difference would inhibing the citadel have made in any case?  The cyno was lit before you got your inhib down.
---
I have a goal now, I mainly play to make money and I want to make them in cool ways. I'm looking for guys that want to make money, are not afraid to PvP and most importantly are up to invest in ships to make more money. I'm looking for a corp that has the same goal as mine but it looks difficult. I don't want my PvP to be sterile on incomes. 
---
Idiot.
---
Exactly the point I had with my corp mates.
---
I came across a few BPC's for faction XL lasers for Avatar, made them and placed on the market.
---
Sales for those are slow, a few every few days or less.
---
That's ok.
---
But one guy constantly shot himself in the leg reducing the price 100mil at the time to fight the ISK war.
---
If you just watch the trade history, you would see that the sale day was imminent, and just keep your price.
---
Eve scout. They have explo loot by back I believe just cant pvp as them unless you're attacked first. 
---
&gt;  you could just cyno in 30 muninns or ass frigs or whatever 1 system over 
---
Or 150km + from the inhib with a ceptor or loki...(if you want to be warpable) 
---
You have to accept that the inhib is not going to keep the grid clear, only the immediate 100km around it. In this case, even if you were able to inhib close to the structure, the ceptor could burn 100km fairly quickly, and just light there. Or, warp off to a ping and warp back...
---
K-Spacer here, downvoting just for the shitty badpost that is ...
---
I'm finding damn difficult to find the perfect corp for me.. 
---
I can't edit the spreadsheet pls fix
---
Thanks sir, appreciated :)
---
Rude.
---
Jesus, few years ago i considered HKRAB as top 1% of top 1% pvp corps. It's pretty funny and sad ta the same time seeing them failscade like this. I wish Noobman was still here. 
---
we had an online mobile cyno inhib on the rorqs itself (200 off the citadel). we didnt attempt to inhib the frig on the citadel because its worthless to even try as i mentioned above
---
YEA! THE MORE YOU KKKKKKNNNNNOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You must be a Jita scammer
---
no one who plays this game is allowed to have this flair
---
yes i mentioned this in the post however there is a difference in jumping assets to tether range or not.
---
Problem is changing hisec wardec mechanics should have never happened to begin with.  Ganking is content for null players when there are no wars. It’s content like burn jita, code, and the like. That’s the ultimate reason why ganking isn’t and won’t be touched. 
---
Marmite, P I R A T, RISK, and anyone else who’s eve content was in Highsec was greatly affected. They are now limited to only bashing citadels because gameplay doesn’t align with null so who cares. All thanks to our CSM. Making it better for player retention yet where do all the new players go? 
---
You pretend to be confused why the silent majority hates you and moved away from the game. The lack of understanding eve different gameplay or even caring to understand others is unfitting for a community voice at best. So don’t sit here and try to justify why wardec mechanics need to be change but then try and say hisec would be too safe without ganking. If thats what we are going off of, leave wardec mechanics alone and remove ganking. Thats an internal political conflict within the CSM. So why even have it?
---
You said iI have zero idea of what im talking about. That’s rich! I’ve been playing this game for years and done it all. From supporting miners who are wardec, to attacking them, hunting other mercenaries, lowsec pirating, Being apart of FW, in nullsec with goon, in nullsec against goons, in WH attacking goons, evicting WH, the list goes in. So now i have to ask. Is this some really bad attempt in mind manipulation? Maybe an attempt to keep others brainwashed into thinking im full of shit? I really dont get what you’re trying to get at here. Anyway lets run thru a few examples.
---
Highsec - is suppose to be the safest space with the lowest rewards. New guy joins eve, run through tutorial. During so, he happens to randomly get blapped by a trasher who warps criminally from gate to gate targeting rookie ships, t1 frigs, and pods to pad his killboard. New guy finally completes tutorial and starts mining. Meet other miners, they teach him and bring him in a corporate. he learns to mine veldspar, omber, ect. Work him up to a mining barge and now he and his newly friends are continuously getting ganked by code. They force the new players and his friend to post a stupid scripts in their bio and pay a recurring fee to mine the belts. They also harass the player by bumping them and if they don’t respond or are afk they are killed. There is no avoiding ganking with the exception of staying docked. So explain to me how wardec mechanics are worst over ganking mechanics? Why was ganking not removed as a quality of life improvement for HS? Since you know, i dont know what im talking about.
---
Lowsec - risk vs rewards are in dire need for some love (mainly a small isk source to get players up and running without the need of joining faction warfare). Their are only 2 decent reliable sources to generate income in LS. LvL V missions and faction warfare. Lvl V being nerfed and requiring a large startup fee along with a heavy investment and great knowledge in market play. Still trying to figure out where i dont know what im talking about.
---
Nullsec - currently holding the best of everything. The supposedly high risk high reward. Yet if you can work your way into a shitty rorq, carrier, super. You’ll have little to no risk and make decent isk for as long as you can repeat the repetitive process every tick. You can afk in a VNI and if you die, most alliance will give you another one for free. So you can go back and afk around a rock haven. You can even have a program warn you when you’re haven is done, when someone is in local, or how far a neutral is out from your current position. Did I mention that is anyone trying to touch any capitals, a cyno will light and will be a beacon for anyone within jump range to descend upon their enemies. Carriers with faxes will spam the field running any possible treat off! The only treat null has is cloaky campaign, excavator gameplay, and killing VNI/afk/botting players. Yet idk what I’m talking about.
---
WH - the group of hardcore players. This is supposed to be the most lucrative space of all. Their risk is extremely high! Never knowing if someone is watching you until it too late. You don’t have the ability of using cynos to immediately reinforce the field. You don’t have supers and titans to push off any sub cap fleet on field. Yet they sit behind nullsec when it come to isk. I can go on and on how wormhole needs a more leverage when comparing it to null. 
---
Anyway, the end results are crap gameplay for anyone not in null. Super safe and lucrative null space. Majority of the new players being soaked into nullsec. Politically corrupted CSM members who bring an unhealthy and bias meta gameplay to misinform CCP what its player base wants and needs. Removing CSM would remove the tumor from eve. So yeah, you’re not fooling anyone.
---
Then why do system wide hammers exist in null?
---
Well thats rude. Just contact horde and ask for a roam whitelist if you bring fair fights that isnt a Problem. 
---
Maybe a little bit? I have 600mil in my pocket and just sitting in a carrier is 2.5 months away for me. I just can't imagine having such INCREDIBLY VAST wealth that losing ships like that won't hurt.
---
I scrape and i pinch to afford another injector to inch me closer to being able to make more isk. And you tell me that you throw away literally just burn billions and it just doesn't really compute.
---
Why do jump beacons exist? I mean, if we are going to ask about something that operates in such a radically different capacity...
---
When someone doesn't support your statement, you don't have to restate it in the hopes that repeating your position will suddenly make them agree with you.
---
Radically different? Cyno jammer: prevents a cyno from going up. Cyno jammer: prevents a cyno from going up...
---
Same. When I first tried station trading I based in Dodixie. A month later I left in a rage and never looked back. OP should just go to jita imho.
---
another "jita-trader" mad, that someone undercut him by a reasonable margin
---
Is it 2010 again?
---
If the rorqual wasn't afk, he could just light his own cyno. Obviously if he had a cyno frigate and it's the same pilot, he wasn't. So what's the difference? He would have lit the cyno on the athanor if you placed something next to it.
---
are you seriously expecting Hilmar to quit from milking every cent out of the customers? not until the game is literally a day from shutting down...
---
did someone shit in ur brain? 
---
One of these items is an offensive tool that is highly mobile and anchors within 2 minutes. The other item is a defensive tool, not mobile and has a longer spool up time. Yes, they are exactly the same.
---
Join Pandemic Horde, Brave or Karma Fleet. They have people who will help you get around null sec really fast.
---
Maybe the other one is an ignorant bastard like me? So for me at least, lets say that I have 100k unit of a mineral and the price per unit would be 2,3k as the lowest sell order. I would probably put my order on 2,2k just go get it sold fast. Even if I lose a lot of ISK that way I at least won't block up one order slot and I get a quick return of cash instead of waiting several days for it to sell (or worse not sell at all and I have to redo it again) 
---
))))
---
Aren't u pandos inside man???
---
the situation itself doesnt matter. i wanted to eloborate on it tho to give an example for ppl reading this. no one cares about your rorqual. i care about tweaking mobile cyno inhib anchoring attributes tho. The fact that there are issues is present even if we would have killed both rorqs
---
What about adding an inhibitor with a little bit more range but it only inhibits caps jumping to it, not bridge. You'd have to jump in subs to kill it before getting caps in. Adds a slight response delay. Can either cyno in off grid or blow it up. It can be balanced with its hp.
---
Your'r'are're
---
Hard if knocked up.
---
&gt;Most industrialist are simply looking for what components are needed to complete a build.
---
&gt;So let’s pretend I get asked to build a Vargur
---
Buying T2 components is idiotic... at best.
---
A cyno scrambler would be better than an inhibitor. Anyone jumping to the cyno would be potioned somewhere random within 2 systems of the cyno slowing the response fleet down.
---
It's my rorqual now because I don't immediately support your desire? Interesting narrative. Tell me more.
---
The throwback is reading all those CCP Names too
---
With proliferation of structures, you don't think they could just jump to another structure in game? Also... it takes 30 seconds for them to be able to tether. If you are going to tackle them, go for it. You don't need 10 minutes do you?
---
Billions of tons of ore to mine daily.          
---
Welcome to New 'miner' Eden. 
---
I never said EXACTLY the same. I was pointing out that at their core they accomplish the same thing. Which is to prevent or make more difficult for an enemy to join the fray. And if ccp was so against people not being allowed to join fights, the system wide jammers would not exist either as they do MORE to prevent enemy forces from being involved. Offense or defense is moot. If they didn’t want them in the game they would just remove them. Not saying OP is right about them being changed. Just saying I think you are wrong about Ccp not liking them. If they don’t then why are they still here? Probably legacy code, I get it..
---
all points i talked about in the post
---
Lmfao. Claiming the CSM was the driving factor in changing CCPs unwillingness to change it after multiple years of not touching it just shows how little influence the CSM has as it is. 
---
Not only that, I’m sure the acquisition by PA factored more into as to retain new players driven off by wardecs.
---
But here is the thing, it won't sell any faster. :)
---
You made the statement, or rather asked the question, about why they exist in response to my statement that I have heard and read enough from ccp to garner they dislike the mobile inhib. I'm not sure where your question should lead? Ask them? They don't like it. It's not me on this one. I haven't stated my feelings on it. I personally think a marauder should put up a cyno  inhib when sieged.
---
&lt;3
---
Perhaps you are looking for an inhib that does 200 km and can be placed within range of a gate or structure?
---
How did the first one died ?
---
See I just disagree that CCP is shit.  We somehow love that they've made the most complex game ever and yet have no patience with them while they try to work on it, and that's not fair.  What's worse, when you just say "ccp is shit" regardless, it invalidates the very real issues people have with them because you've been crying wolf about shit that just doesn't work for you for so long.
---
For you, it may look like braindead people losing ISK and from the perspective of someone trading few item types at super high margins, that may make sense. The other trader may sell hundreds of other things and not give a rats ass about babysitting that one order for days to make 80% profit when he can just dump it on the market at his standard 25% (or whatever) along with all the others and spend his time keeping his scheme running or just having fun.
---
And yes, of course he will still be undercut by 0.01ISK even with his drastically lower price. But with the margins slashed like that, it will attract less people hunting for a quick fortune and the normal market cycle will take over. And my experience is, everything sells eventually even when you are not undercutting all the time.
---
i dont want to talk numbers tbh. surely something like you proposed would be more viable compared to what we have now. i merely want to start a discussion about the current state which isnt balanced if thats even a word
---
Poor test, Komodo down, and even that wasn't enough for the big balls loss of the week.
---
In a very simple terms yes, you are correct however, you have to take into account resistance profiles, the ammo you are using for damage type, is the target moving etc. In reality your 200 dps will be more 160 or in some cases more due to stacking the odds in your favour. Best way to determine this is to look at standard fits and carry all ammo types allowing you to take advantage and be prepared for all situations. 
---
Maybe he's in a Corp with 25% tax
---
Yeah what they've failed to realize so far is that allowing a bunch of FAX and supers to jump into every minor engagement also denies most people the ability to participate, because only other giant groups at war and on deployment are able to match that escalation.
---
It only denies the easiest most straight forward way of participating (jumping caps / bridging subs right on top of the rorqual). All other methods of joining the fight like jumping or bridging anywhere else in the system or neighbouring ones would still be open. 
---
This would move the balance slightly away from the extremely defender favoured current state, and opens up some counter play for an attacker. It also rewards organised responses on part of the defender, requiring more coordination than brainless get on titan take bridge or jump to cyno reactions.
---
Yeah unlike null groups that allow for growth amirite
---
^ This guy is important, he yells at people.
---
If a seven minute invulnerability timer and an assload of tank is not enough to gather your forces maybe you should lose the rorq. Have you tried lighting the cyno in a different system and gating in for example? Just because you cannot arrive on grid instantly doesnt mean its denying you from gathering forces. 
---
Doing fine here
---
Reading between the lines, you don't like umbrellas and want to inhib the entire grid.
---
inb4 icon talk
---
What it shows is that, like with any other lobbying effort, it can take years of pushing to get an issue addressed. Had past CSMs not made it an issue, it wouldn't have even been studied, and CCP wouldn't have realized they had a major problem. Feel free to ask them if you don't believe that.
---
As far as I can tell, the PA acquisition has had zero impact on any kind of game mechanic changes in the game. And since they told us they were working on these changes prior to the acquisition, that blows up that theory. All the comments made in the minutes were prior to the acquisition. 
---
Haters gonna hate, but the Imperium could only benefit from more alliances being independent like INIT. You don't see Bastion having more than 10-20 every Imperium fleet, so it's not like Goon fleets are going to suffer much, they'll form 4 fleets instead of 5 lol. 
---
I'd like small gang pvp to actually be fun again. I'm not sure if it's due to the mechanics or just a shift in mentality, but smallgang pvp is awful right now. People either dock up and hide until you leave or drop caps on you. There is *very* rarely anything between that.
---
When brave has a rule that they aren't supposed to use caps in GE- because it would drive away any and all content, you know there's a problem.
---
Also, nerfing rorquals (and faxes to a smaller extent) into the fucking ground would be a pretty nice thing imo. I'm not exactly sure if it would help the smallgang thing, but rorquals are the most OP bullshit I've ever seen in an MMO.
---
Karma invited me after I went to delve, I tried code but it's stupid and I'm now trying wingspan, still skilling for it
---
Eve 2.0, the experience is stale 
---
This. people dont understand that if you drop the price people will not buy it faster. you buy modules/items whe you NEED it. It is not real life house-wives checking the local Wallmart for bargains.
---
More meaningful PvP, and a better way for smaller, non-alligned Corporations and Alliances to have the in-game and out of game infrastructure they need to be competitive without shelling out hundreds of real life dollary doos to support their in game needs
---
no i am okay with everything if eveything as smart and skill intense counterplay...even the counterplay
---
Focusing on making EVE a pvp game with a rotating meta to help prevent stagnation. Create conflict drivers instead of large swaths of safe space (due to easily gameable mechanics) for bots. Make it so cleaning up citadels isnt a massive pain and give capitals a role to do at the same time.
---
TL;DR: Some fucking iteration of things stagnating for years.
---
He might sell more though, often if I need to buy something, and notice that the price is great I'll just buy more items, maybe even the whole stack.
---
it does however, prevent greedy people trying to get higher prices from undercutting you most of the time though, hence, you sell yours first (and faster)
---
The anarchistic, freewheeling feeling of 2008 Eve era outside nullsec politics.
---
Tribute and Impass Co2 was EvE to me, constant fighting all the time. 
---
Log in EU tz there was either a PL + NC fleet to fight, a band of merry wormholers or Goons.
---
Making tons of isk jumping my freighter about.
---
And oh boy did I get to use my Carrier a lot. (Nearly never my dread though which was sad, think my dread alt saw action 3 times).
---
Just not been able to get back into the game since, but like to keep up to date on the reddit!
---
&gt; The central problem of the Space Lawyer is that he commits himself not to the rules as they actually are, but as he wrongly believes them to be.
---
Ganking and war decs aren't the same.  That you immediately conflate the two makes me question everything else in this word salad.  
---
The rest of the war dec changes haven't happened yet, and I still see Marmite and PIRAT and others getting plenty of content. I talk to those guys every day and they're not screaming at me for killing their fun, so I'm going to take that at face value. 
---
The "silent majority" doesn't hate the CSM. At worst, they're ambivalent. The folks who hate the CSM are a vocal, very small minority.  There's no "internal political conflict" here - ganking is fundamentally EVE. You remove that, and high sec becomes 99% safe - it becomes completely possible to avoid all non-consensual PvP and that's fundamentally anti-EVE. 
---
I don't care what you've done - you're making arguments that aren't based in reality. That tells me you don't know what you're talking about. Your run through of the various tiers of space is like a 6 month players analysis. "WH risk is extremely high!" - go ask them if they agree with that, lol. 
---
The same with the whole "politically corrupted CSM members" blah blah blah. Come on, dude. 
---
It's cute. 
---
Reread the thread and my question. It's not about panic or tank. It's not about rorquals. It's about one side wanting more time to gather forces while the other side cannot gather forces or get them on field.
---
Damn skippy.
---
yes, this would be a desirable development, not going to happen tho, simply because there are no incentives. I'd say bastion will be back under goons skirt sooner as you might think.
---
Even with Brave not using caps you can't really do smallgang there, you will just get blobbed. It's fun for casual fleetfights to go there but for that you need numbers and it's not really smallscale anymore.
---
LOL, WHers are so easy to bait. All I have to do is show up. 
---
Gottem
---
I mean, the more they downvote the more I like the idea of finishing off all of wormhole space. Because oh no muh karma! (One post with a cute puppy gets plus 1000 karma).
---
It's mainly corps in th3 imperium renting out systems. In fountain it's 80% imperium corps that want to get away from the rorquals drama. 
---
I do this to stop the greedy people like you from undercutting me.  I don't want to update my orders 30 times a day, I've got like 300 other orders to maintain.  
---
As long as I'm making a margin I'm comfortable with, I'm ok with that.   Sure, I'll try the small undercuts at first, but if some neckbeard is .01 isking me, I'll do larger cuts in hopes you'll stop undercutting.  
---
Also, if I keep lowering, and you keep undercutting, I'll just buy your stock out and relist it at the higher price if I feel like it, or if I think you don't have any other stock to undercut me with.
---
Do iiiit!
---
yeah, it's only 21k DPS + neut pressure vs a mining ship. Everything ok here, nothing to worry about :ok\_hand:   
---
Would be better if they had a bottleneck type deployable. Give someone random 30 to 90 second traffic control. Would be rage inducing.
---
the biggest shobon imaginable :3
---
It'a just cute - all I have to do is show up and they turn into a frothing mass.
---
Come to Geminate and small gang with us... horde has no caps o swear
---
I'm not against it myself. I have been on both sides of the equation a lot.
---
the sheer fact that you have the lowest price guarantees it will sell first and technically faster.  to deny this outright is just silly.
---
For me it was PFR circa 2015, CHAOS circa 2016/2017, or (oddly enough) CENTI circa 2018.
---
PFR was basically brave, if brave wasn't welded to TEST's dick. None of us were very good, but we had a lot of fun being awful.
---
CHAOS was fun, but a little oppressive to some of the smaller entities tbh. We did have a lot of outnumbered fights against a competent enemy. We won some and lost some, but they were all a lot of fun.
---
CENTI was awesome because it was a tiny group hitting well above their weight against a larger group, and winning. It was a lot of work, and a lot of late nights for some of the EU dudes, but damn it was fun.
---
Those are the big and known nb friendly corps, but even the smaller nullsec corps are good as they are mostly part of bigger alliance and federation. I went with the corp, that sent the best invitation mail and those were Imperial Guardians and i do not pity my choice even a little bit.¨
---
I did not know much about nullsec drama or anything like that before, but it turned out i ended in GSF in Delve anyway. And now i am a Goon pet (according to this sub at least). :D 
---
As a rule of thumb i would say, if a corp is recruiting, it should have at least some mechanisms to help and teach the newbros in place, or at least a few senior ppl active in corp chat, otherwise, most nb's will be lost in nullsec and would not even know what to do there. 
---
You're going to die, a lot if you PVP. Learn to deal with loss because this game (unlike most) doesn't respawn you with all the junk you were just killed in.
---
Is the long term state of the game currently predicted to stay in a healthy state under the new ownership?
---
A couple months ago I held off on returning because it seemed potentially hazardous to put my time into it considering that company's track record. How do things look now?

Pls no.

I'm still traumatised from 2016 i think, when the alliance i was in at that time tried to help these people.

&gt; Omg your still around. What a loser. Oddly enough code has died. Peep there blog. They are getting increasingly less content. What a joke.
---
Well hello there Seth Anzomi's reddit alt! Last time I checked the Saviour still releases a new post every day. Remember that time he featured you?  
---
http://www.minerbumping.com/2017/05/attack-on-poinen-part-1.html
---
this joke made me rage
---
Literally every time I've been to O-W, someone has dropped a HAW dread on me.
---
Context? All i know about you is that youre some politician lol.
---
&gt;cannot gather forces or get them on field.
---
But that's just plain wrong, as the guy above you rightly pointed out.
---
The problem is that Rorquals can be found mining near a structure.
---
We live in querious in init and are happy about that, dont worry.
---
Three options for me: 
---
go to lowsec, be a pirate or join a militia. 
---
Join PH or goons and do the big null thing. 
---
Join a WH corp. 
---
Brave is full of shit, they dropped caps on 6 enyos and 3 deacons. Not just one or 2 either. 3 faxes 20+ caps 2 supers.
---
your in blades of grass isnt that the same as biomassing?
---
As you clearly state, the box is open, it can no longer be closed. Injectors and Rorquals have killed the game's future.
---
The closest thing I had was when I brought like 10 jackdaws and some tackle. They brought a 30 man caracal/osprey gang. If I played my cards right, and got lucky, I could have snagged a few. That didn't happen, but I'm not exactly experienced with that sort of thing so I chalked it up to poor FCing.
---
Goons and csm gone
---
That's not how the example reads out above. Right or wrong, he wanted more time for his team to gather while an interceptor and sabres held target but wanted to deny the other side the ability to respond.
---
I dunno if we have a FW/lowsec rep on csm. 
---
You're literally talking to people who thought it was impossible to evict an 80 man corp
---
Don't bother reasoning. Just move on with your day 
---
This is quite hard to do imo, making money by PvP is not the best way (unless you go ganking freighters). 
---
Usually when you kill other player ship, it only drops a bit of its fittings (less than half in avg) and the ship itself is destroyed, so you either have to fly supercheap ships/fits (so you do not mind losing 5 ships to kill 1), or be very good, so you do not die. 
---
Idk if there are corps (or even players) that try to make isk by pvp (most of them farm isk by other means so they can sponsor their pvp loses). 
---
Anyway kudos to you, if you manage to turn profit on PvP, you effectively skip the grind and will be left only with the fun part. :)
---
a server reset
---
Tbh, I don't really understand the mentality behind it. Dropping that many caps on a few frigs is just denying content for everyone involved.
---
Independent. Init. Yeah OK.
---
Next you'll tell me snuff isn't affiliated with goons. Lol we aren't a mega coalition, we're just blue and show up for anything important 
---
Ooh, interesting. This will create a lot of content for a lot of people.
---
I've read your question and denying still means denying not delaying. And yes one side has more time to gather forces while the other side has the advantage of a fucking supercap umbrella i think that more than makes up for the extra 2 minutes you'd take to gate in your supers or muninn fleets for 1 whole system. 
---
Small gang/non-bloc aligned content that doesn't feel like a second job to obtain.
---
Capital ships that aren't utterly oppressive to subcaps.
---
Regular balance passes on unbalanced ships.
---
The alliance tournament.
---
Any indication that someone, anyone, anywhere, is actually listening to the concerns of the playerbase about the health of the game. 
---
I kind of like this to deploy on the side just to really annoying them
---
Here's the thing - if we had dropped anything other than long range fit Titans, you guys would have been fine. Dreks can easily defang a super capital, and you wouldn't have been pushed off grid as easily. 
---
It was the combination of the structure and the titans that was the issue, not the cyno inhib. Anything else that dropped wouldn't have been able to push you all off grid. 
---
I've argued that citadel mechanics make it next to impossible to take a fight on a grid with a citadel, but that apparently isn't a universal position. 
---
I'd rather nerf LR gun tracking on Titans and nerf citadel defenses, honestly. 
---
Yeah we brought a gang of 15-ish in a month or so ago and they dropped a HAW Nag on us and killed our Sabre.  
---
That's because the mentality isn't "we want to have fights," it's "get the fuck out of my space right goddamn now, and never come back." Obvious krabbing benefits aside, it turns out that people love the concept of territory for its own sake.
---
Haven't played this game in 3-4 month's, not about to log in the next month's either, should be safe then.
---
Eve is still great. PVP is still great.  So many of you so called small gang lovers run away from an even fight just as fast as you run from the blob.  All you really want is an easily winnable fight.  Why dont you move to low sec?  Oh ya, because you get curb stomped by real solo artists. 
---
no u
---
Ive had carriers dropped or jumped through on a gate pretty often with horde. Their claim to no cap usage is pretty weak.
---
~~just adapt~~
---
Just adopt  FTFY
---
I'm in INIT. When we hit Rage, I was one of the public faces of the campaign (me and Pando), so the WHers hate me especially because of the over-the-top posting during that week. 
---
That was undoubtedly in impass, brave’s Jean pocket where they drop on anything that moves. The “gud fites” rule applies only in catch.
---
The problem is also to the module itself. Even when anchored. A single titan shot or dread can kill the module even with logi reps. 
---
yes that's why they went to all that work to implement the new cyno jammers, because they hate denying one side the opportunity to participate
---
There is an extremist segment of the community which steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that the game developers themselves approve of ganking. They simply can't handle the truth because their anti-ganking platform rests on the foregone conclusion that nonconsensual PvP is evil and those who engage in it are sociopaths.
---
One of our requirements in WDS is that your character joining is financially independent. We do not generally do much PVE in WiNGSPAN, so the main sources of income are nearly 100% based on our interactions with our prospective customers. 
---
(This includes our WH bounty system, in which you get paid to find wormholes that people are looking for. While this could be considered "non-PVP" it is still generally done while looking for other content.)
---
I'm not trying to discourage you, I would just rather be up front with a future applicant.
---
In the meantime, chat us up in our public channel Wing-DS -&gt; since they changed how the chat system works we can't cloak in the channel much anymore, but people are always watching, like the good wormholers we are (queue the incoming rage)
---
Anyways, have a good one for now.
---
Fly dangerously o7
---
Do the Alliance Tournament this year and actually not half ass it (e.g. the marketing, prizes) - the EveNT side of the effort was flawless.
---
Support player tournaments and not half ass it like last year. Give the folks running them proper support on Thunderdome.
---
The above two items have been noted as 'labors of love' and the Devs weren't "paid to do it". Proper time should be allocated to the Devs to support an activity that generates subscriptions (the fallout of not having proper tournaments will impact CCP hard in the long run).
---
Make it harder to carebear in Nullsec. It should be like rust. Lighting a cyno and pressing a PANIC button shouldn't be the only skills needed to live. Many fixes have been suggested, I am not sure what the right one is. But it is totally uninteresting to go hunting in nullec as a smaller entity.
---
There are and yes they kill industrial ships. And yes they don't even spend much because they do it in hisec. But they are too snoob and don't want me around so I gotta make my own fleet to do it
---
&gt;wanted to deny the other side the ability to respond.
---
No that's a strawman you've created. The other side doesn't need to be able to jump LR titans onto a citadel to be able to respond. Light a cyno off grid, use gates, whatever. And lets not forget this is *after* they gave the attackers enough time to anchor an inhib. 
---
Hahahaha
---
sry but all wrong mate
---
- citadel wasnt even gunned and that doesnt matter for the post
---
- these dreks can not fight caps, its a pure gank doctrine and again doesnt matter
---
- the whole post is about anchoring restrictions of mobile cyno 
---
inhibs and counterplay emerging from this
---
your train of thought seem to start when the caps are already on grid which is not even close to the message of this post
---
So you're fine with a rorqual literally being invulnerable for 7 minutes to give the defenders time to form &amp; move in order to save their 30-60k ehp/s tank capital, but you're not fine with then having to cyno off grid and warp in or - god forbid - establish grid control with subcaps in order to bring in their legions of supers &amp; faxes because it might deny the defenders a chance to participate? Seems fine
---
Yeah. If people need it they will buy it, doesn't matter the price, especially with prices thatvare just slightly cheaper and lsoe yourself money.
---
Give me more types or rocks to mine.
---
HK are FCON now?
---
Yes but if the lowest price is 5m or 2.5m wont sell it faster. As long as you are the lowest
---
But often times there will be other people willing to drop and then you aren't first anymore
---
Just because things are changing doesn't mean they're the right changes.
---
Don't know about your first two sentences but damn does the rest ring true.
---
Your projecting mate. I didn't say that. I was pointing out that was what he was asking for, on the attackers side. I did not say that was what should be on one side or the other.
---
its not an even fight if your numbers in caps equal the numbers of frigs you drop on...
---
&gt; goon
---
&gt; whining he got dropped on by caps
---
It's not a straw man. It's a fact. The current narrative and argument is "We want to make small gang activity great, so we should be able to go deep into enemy territory and isolate a target and 10 v. 1 him and prevent outside help from getting on grid."
---
I talked to jolly actually, I don't like pve and as you can read on the spreadsheet I don't need money, I know how to make them, but I want to make them in a different and larger way. Also I spent the majority of my time in wh, so I'm ok with it
---
Because lowsec is either dead or worse than null. The active areas are crowded with large(ish) groups, so instead of being hunted by one alliance's cyno alts, you're being hunted by half a dozen alliance's cyno alts. 
---
You are right. I rescind my statement that CCP is leery of changing the mobile inhibitor. Now that I agree with you, because you want me to- does that change how CCP feels about it and what they have stated?
---
The real question should be. Why the fuck does a SUPPORT SHIP outperform MINING barges that are supposed to MINE?
---
What if the problem was cynos themselves, and not the inhib?
---
*Hey guys, wormholer here. Tried to use a cyno inhib to stop a cyno, they just lit a cyno further away. Buff inhibs I want my free kills*
---
Nothing will change for the better until CCP takes 3 steps back and looks at the entirety of the ships as a balance pass. Bandaids and filler do nothing but make it worse. 
---
Give me a conflict driver and I’d log in more. Change pos mechanics to mirror pos mechanics more. At least give me a chance to try to kill it and not always tz tank. Also, limit the citadels per constellation please. Kthnx
---
Then you're being disingenuous. They aren't unrelated. You can't argue that CCP doesn't like cyno inhibs because they deny people a chance to participate at the same time as PANIC exists in the game as proof that CCP doesn't really mind one side literally not participating for 7 minutes. 
---
The core of your argument is that you want to go deep into enemy territory, surprise buttsex someone and keep their friends from being able to support them. That's not content. That is asking CCP to facilitate seal clubbing and elite 10 or 20 man fleets to whore on 1 or 2 defenders you find in an asteroid belt.
---
&gt; these dreks can not fight caps
---
Then you're using shitty dreks. All the dreks I see can both fight and tank caps without much worry. Could need nerfing. Downvote me if you agree
---
*shrugs* Guess people need their enemies.
---
How very, very true.
---
I understand that the citadel wasn't gunned, but the point was made elsewhere that the citadel could have killed the cyno inhib, even if it had a longer range. Extending the cyno inhib range wouldn't have helped in this instance because you were fighting on grid with a citadel.
---
You're making the argument that the cyno inhib is the issue, when it seems more likely that it's the presence of the citadel on the grid that's really the issue. If it wasn't there, all of the stuff you're talking about wouldn't have happened or been an issue. 
---
Link where CCP has said they don't like the mobile cyno inhib because it denies one side the chance to participate.
---
I always get a little sad when something unique or in a very limited number gets destroyed - even in a video game. o7
---
Because some people use portraits(and avatars on discord) to tell who is who instead of names.
---
I always get confused the first few times I see someone after they change their discord avatar.
---
&gt; Aryth again brought up that a lot of this sounds like wormholes would like to get the benefits of nullsec, without the relative danger.
---
What a fucking tool.  "Danger" in nullsec, what a riot.
---
WH space have small gang pvp all the time! 
---
LOL!
---
I want a full scale war that i can use my caps in.
---
Dura lexx :p
---
Well obviously it's only okay if it happens to other people.
---
Has anyone said a lowsec to Stain yet? 
---
Small scale pvp*

*when we are getting BTFO'd
---
Its not a Support Ship Anymore... Its a Capital Mining Ship. So yeaha its fine. 
---
You can kill a Titan with 100 Bombers but you cant kill a rorqual with brain with 100 bombers... thats the real thing.
---
Yeah.  Middle of a Tuesday workday.   Iv'e never been to a mass test.    
---
CCP Guard literally said it in the balance discussion in EVE Vegas 2018 with 100 people in the room. I was in that room. I believe they have it recorded and up on the forums. He  said that they had severe reservations when they put it in the game and intentionally toned it way down because they didn't want it to be oppressive in allowing for defenders to respond or overly punishing someone for not having lightning reflexes to instantly cyno when someone came on grid. That's why it doesn't have a lot of shield or armor hp, so it can't be turbo repped. That is why it isn't an instant deploy.
---
They weren't the top 1% of 1%; they just blobbed in wormholes. That was it.
---
you are somehow fucked in the brain
---
They've had more changes than, say, FW have.
---
And I'm seeing, again, a misunderstanding of that the CSM is for. We're \_primarily\_ a feedback mechanism. Something for CCP to ask questions of.
---
Sure, we can take things to CCP, but most of what's brought doesn't get actioned, because CCP just doesn't have the bandwidth to do that, \_and\_ everything else they need to. 
---
it appeares with all the experiance of +xx killed rorqs and +xx failed attempts cause we couldnt hold against caps since december and actually making the drek doctrine a thing as on of the first wh groups, if not the first, my group clearly is not not eligable evaluate its strengths and weaknesses 
---
You didn't mention the hero bubbler who bubbled the undock of DeadCo!   The hero! 
---
Eve classic 2012 server 
---
The gud fites shouldn't have rules unless you're a total idiot.
---
Does anyone know what happened to the video's forum on Eve online and if there are resources anywhere to find old videos?
---
As an old player i used to enjoy some of the MC videos by Eyeshadow and was looking to see if i could find some of them
---
I just need some time off of work and all the fun stuff happening while I’m home 
---
We can have AI (kinda) program the site too!
---
;) very good!
---
Apologies, I couldn't comb through everything while at work! As long as you are prepared I have no qualms about it.
---
You just have to get through an annoying (read: exciting and amazing) interview with one of our recruiting staff.
---
Looking forward to the application.
---
1) Fix FAXes (i.e. nerf them into the ground for subcap fights)
---
2) Better cyno inhib mechanics (hic script + cyno inhib shuts down active cynos, please)
---
3) Nerf fighter application into the ground
---
4) No bosons
---
5) More clearly defined roles for the very many useless subcaps - 
---
T3Ds, most T1 BS, the Widow, faction BS, combat interceptors
---
6) Nerf rorqual tank or remove PANIC
---
The game has become far too balanced in favor of the defender and against anyone looking for dynamic content. We're too focused on strategic objectives &amp; large, stationary fights based around structures. Roaming is essentially dead in an era where a carrier is the best ship for the job 9/10 times, and when it fails a super or titan will do just fine. Local defense fleets are oppressively strong, far more than is needed to defend their space - especially considering that more people are choosing to PvE in extremely tanky capitals rather than subcaps. Rorqual tank + PANIC are still obscene. FAX tank + rep strength is still obscene in the context of subcap/non-supercap fights, and supercap fights have devolved into who can bring the most faxes. 
---
It's a very stale capital-focused meta that feels far more N+1 than it has since the slowcat days
---
Ok so, here is what you do. Go live in wormhole space. Tons of small gang pvp, the most caps you'll see is a handful, and they have to warp in. 
---
Low sec is in a worse state than nul for PvP. At least there's a sort of point to it in nul. Sort of. 
---
Will apply in some days, skilling :)
---
Oh yeah I did forget that.  He bought us a lot of time.
---
Between a year ago and now, when did you develop grandiose delusions?
---
I  was in PFR for a short time in 2015 after SMP collapsed next door. Was a lot of fun :)
---
A complete wipe. 
---
I have to agree with querns. The message is GTFO. If people want small gang, they need to fix faction warfare so it forces small gang engagements. Every null sec entity is going to drop caps on your face.
---
Yup, agree with you. We need more range for cyno inhib.  
---
Couple days ago we caught 5 test rorq near mining citadel and we cant kill them, even with 3 cyno inhib on grid, because they lit cyno on structure with their titan fleet.
---
Not getting dropped by 20 Titans as soon as you tackle a VNI. 
---
Better.
---
Yes please
---
There is another problem most people dont even know it. The moment you put stuff up the market you pay the taxes. You keep undercutting the stock for something you payed high taxes you wont recover. So you will sell something at 10 million but you already payed taxes for 20 mil isk when you entered the market. Just an example.
---
Because we have a bit of a simple farmers infestation. Where there are staged caps there are bored pilots looking to drop em.
---
without checking numbers...i am pretty sure a refinery cannot alpha the inhib and even has low dps. pretty sure we could rep it with some smart logi play. counterplay to that would be to bring subs and establish grid control.
---
i would agree that ofc the citadel being on grid is an issue. however id like go little steps that mostly evolve around counterplay. imagin i would have said remove refineries from the belt grid...the reeee would be way louder
---
Yeah I hadn't used a carrier in a long ass time, I forgot how to launch fighters at first lol.  More than a little rusty.
---
As an ex mcav member, and was in charge of structures and everything. I'm kinda sad to see mcav become the huge cringefest they are today. I wish them the best. But my God am I happy to be out.
---
All null-sec blocks are full of shit. May it be Darkness, Goons, Brave, TEST, all of them are full of crap because it's big mouths but zero balls. I've done 3 years in null-sec blocks and my god this was fucking AIDS. People bitching about being better than that block or another block while being exactly ass full of shit, talking about deploying and doing campaigns to free a region from X or Y block in a holy jihad, man null-sec blocks are just retarded krabs that in the end don't want to fight. 
---
As someone who hasn't played since we (goons) took delve, my cursory understanding is abyssal things are totally RNG in how they come out, and stuff with entirely good stats are beyond officer good and worth &lt;&lt;A LOT&gt;&gt;?
---
I've thought about it. But I think I'm too burnt out on eve right now to give it an honest try.
---
If someone rich wants to buy me an AT ship to fly I will go lose it 
---
This. If you got mad and stopped undercutting, it worked! Big cuts aren’t always dumb. 
---
A rebuild of the pve and the economy coming back down to pre 2013 levels.
---
Remove shitadels.
---
Not that hard though if you fly cheap 2-10 mil ships. Like, I don't make mad bank, but usually I earn enough to replace my ships and even plex my account.
---
So why do they actually leave? What the real reason here?
---
That's fair, we all get there and take breaks. I have to say though from time to time me and a few friends invade a wh just to pop a citadel. Watching the loot pinata explode and picking up all the tasty stuff is quite satisfying. It almost always leads to some small gang fun too.
---
Nice try star citizen!
---
And use Z-S Overview instead of the stock one.
---
He said that in the context of reducing the time to anchor and increasing the HP. I was in the room as well. You're leaving out very important context. He wasn't saying "we don't want this in the game because it suppresses content;" he was saying "we were worried it would suppress content but it doesn't really seem to be working very well so we're going to roll back some of the limitations we put on it initially."
---
I've recently come back after an 8 year break. I've been enjoying abyssal sites, but am looking for other options.  I can generally only play 30-60 minutes a day so abyssals fit that perfectly.
---
Is there any point in joining a real corp/alliance with such restricted play time? I'd imagine I wouldn't be able to really do much on the side of fleets/ops but I have no idea how those work anymore with all of the bridges and such set up now.
---
I am sorry that you were not able to pop out of a wormhole in a small frigate and kill a capital sized ship easily without a strong response occurring. 
---
Need to kill enyobrains before that happens
---
2) Ochre First.
---
Actually, that might be rule 1.
---
In the tempest fight.  Did they just not have ANY logi?  or not enough?   Why did they just sit there and die. 
---
the damage control is now one of the best modules, fitted on almost every single ship
---
you probably remember it as crap
---
Keep it up, loved it.  My fav part is when your sec status dipped for blowing up miners, I did chuckle at that.
---
Fly safe!
---
??????????????? 
---
how many years ago was it when they put the inhib in the game!? Maybe it needs a iteration in todays meta.
---
Meh, it´s more that people mocked him for chestbeating like a mad cunt for evicting an inactive 50 man corp from a wormhole with the entire Imperium forces at his back while trying to sell it like it was a huge accomplishment for the strong and independent alliance that is The Initiative. Unlike irl his usual schlock didn´t work out as planned and he got turbomad when people denied him the recognition he craved for, making himself look like an apeshit lunatic in the process. You will find him in every related threat now downplaying and dreailing the topic and doing his best to show everyone how little he actually cares while caring plenty. Quite sad tbh.  
---
Why does the corax have a drone bay in its model but cant use drones????
---
I mean, it's also that I don't know anybody in WH space, and I don't really like the thought of doing all that scanning. Really the only thing about WH space that is appealing to me is the pvp.
---
Yeah nah
---
Not even dropping a thought on that game lol
---
They made some really poor choices recently. 
---
I played eve many times but always got bored fast. I would like a sort of arena to PvP in be it just for practice and way better pve mission content. 
---
Also some of the aspects of the game are over complicated imo
---
This is Eve. Become judge, jury and executioner if this bothers you so much. Steal their rats, bump them, heck hire Code or Wingspan. Take the old hat around for some coin to fund the catalysts...
---
enjoy your 237,808 isotopes and 2 cargo expanders
---
Was a fun fight 
---
It's a reward from a time before extractors and such, and accumulates up to 10M SP rolling between mirrors if you have participated in up to the last 5 mass tests at any given time of mirror.  It's really just supposed to be a token thank you to test participants, and doing anything grander would likely cause more frustrations around e.g. the timing of the tests.    
---
Ha! Thats hilarious! Take this at face value. Stratagem. Failed diplomacy, FA along with other HS entities are completely disgusted with the new changes. I also know some voiced their opinions on the matter and went unheard. So don’t try to pretend you have the backing of those HS player base. As to your “majority” comment. The reality is, the majority don’t speak. The majority laughs at reddit and say “its cancer and i would touch it join if the survivability of the game depended in it”. They understand how political certain player groups are with the devs. Its even written in history with Bob and the BPO. They understand that I’m wasting my time in an already lost fight. At least I’m willing to stand in the fire and let their voice be written. That way no one can ever say it wasn’t mentioned nor fought for. You’re delusional if you honestly think I’m the minority. Im going on a limb to say you’re smart enough to see that HS, LS, and WH are in the worst periods in Eve history. You’re smart enough to keep the meta gaming going and attempt to close the curtain on the horrible facts im revealing. Lastly, in response to your wardec and ganking. Since when did i say they were similar? Can you please cooy and paste that? I said ganking is worst and should have been handled before wardec mechanics. I honestly laughed when i read that. It’s your attempt at collateral damage. You talk about 99.9% safe yet look at null. You talk about avoiding pvp yet here are wardec mechanics changes. You’re full of shit any everyone knows it. Its rather or not people want to go out their way and call you out. Most just stop playing the game. Im in fear thats the game i invested years will have the same
---
Outcome as the Chinese server. Anyway keep meta gaming like a fool. Im said what i had to so no reason for me to continue talking to a troll.
---
I have found alot of the time either you have to be in the right place at the right time and do the right thing or you have to grind.  
---
Like many others in eve I mine.  I don't use a rorq, I use 4 coveters and mine as much as I can on Sundays.  If I am mining monozite then I can make a good 1 bill in a coupe hours.   1 bill a week isn't bad isk for a couple of hours.  
---
I also have PI set up across all my accounts.  Granted I am in the middle of moving locations for ease of access but I make coolant.    Couple of characters strictly pull up raw and make t1.  Then I move it to a dedicated char that makes strictly coolant across all 6 planets.  Collect and reset every 4 days.   That nets me a good amount of isk monthly that doesn't require that much work from me.  
---
Lastly, I also invest in faction modules and other things on the market.  I look at killmails in my area of space and seed the nearby stations with common things.  Ammo, Cap boosters, Scrams, hulls maybe, etc.   This nets me another healthy amount of isk monthly just because people are lazy and need things so they are willing to pay an inflated price for them. 
---
say hi to beast for me. 
---
I'll get you a flair so you don't have to sign posts, friend.
---
It's easy: Come to GE- in Catch, you get a gud fite with no caps. But even newbies need to make money, so if you go roam in Impass we'll drop caps on you until you leave, or ideally go back to Catch.
---
&gt; The gud fites shouldn't have rules unless you're a total idiot.
---
Also, according to your logic here, we _should_ drop caps on you in Catch, since there's no rules.
---
If there is a keepstar in O-P that finalizes the Fountain keepstar superhighway. woot.
---
Though today's test is time limited, we will definitely have an open period of general access coming soon so everyone can give it a go - this is our "let's see exactly what is messed up before general soaking and exposure" test.  
---
I still play, but it would be refreshing to not to roam 100+ jumps and run into nothing but ratting/botting VNIs and supers/titans being dropped on anything we tackle...
---
Correct, it is from the Amarr Tournament. The question asked, was in regards to the acronym. The general usage of the acronym is to describe the limited edition ships from PvP tournaments. If you read the question above (and aren't just trolling for an argument on semantics) you would see that the question was in regards to calling ships AT ships vs Special Edition ships.
---
I would like the fights to mean something. Not just "content" or krab saves. But unfortunately there is way too much isk/minerals/space in the game for that to really happen
---
Dude... he literally said they were concerned before they put it in game about it being too powerful for the aggressor. That's the entire point.
---
They lowered the anchor time within the last 6 months.
---
Sorry that you had to lose such an expensive ship to such a lowbob asshole drop.
---
Agreed, the main intent here from Brave is to get people out of _Impass_, where we krab. If you go roam to GE- and Catch in general, we won't drop caps on you. If you move further down into Impass we will, since we want people to come roam to Catch but not Impass.
---
3 carriers on a GM, boi that's elite. If you drop carriers on frigats, you are an A-Type asshole people. 
---
Duality was remirrored on the 28th Feb, with a snapshot taken from around the same time. 
---
The thing with brave specifically is that they encourage people to come to catch for gudfites, and advertise Impass as the no fun zone...or at least they did. Now it seems like Catch is a no-fun zone as well.
---
T2 Lasers? What a fucking poor
---
Comes to an Alliance staging system... Complains about getting blopped. 
---
Brilliant.
---
Will do!
---
anchor time doesnt matter when the most obvious spot to light a cyno cannot be inhibited 
---
Who?
---
Alts voting on disbanding. News at 11.
---
And then he said they were wrong and that's why they were decreasing the anchor time to a minute and increasing the EHP. You're misrepresenting what he said and doing a bad job of it. 
---
Lots of corps will have a dude at least that gets off to scanning chains out. You should at least be able to if need be but don’t expect nonstop scanning 
---
"If you don't want to get blobbed, go to GE- for gudfites"
---
"lol what did you expect in GE- you fucking idiot"
---
Pick one.
---
100 bombers...you can easily kill a rorq. 
---
50 bombers is tougher. But 100 will nuke it.
---
in a poor attempt to get good at PVP, as of right now the bastion is the embarrassment of the imperium, being the only member not deployed in someway. (so they deployed to their own renter space) in order to form an expensive  meat shield for goons (smells like new CO2)
---
stupid question but how do I move ships between stations? Basically I am moving from the starter area to somewhere else to do some mining but will moving take me hours for all the ships? 
---
&gt; Buff inhibs I want my free kills
---
What the fuck does this mean? Let's walk through your definition of a free kill. A kill is free if I:
---
1) Find a target
---
2) Tackle the target
---
3) Form a fleet to kill the target
---
4) Apply enough damage to overcome its tank &amp; SEVEN MINUTE INVULNERABILITY
---
In what fucking way is that a free kill? What kill ISN'T a free kill under your definition? Quit being a smooth brain
---
Lol
---
My gang of 6 cruisers and frigs to fight another gang of similar strength. 
---
He said they were changing it slightly and we're going to keep an eye on it. You can narrative all you want, but that doesn't change that it is all on video. I am stating what the conversation was and the take away. You are pulling it down a narrative path after I gave you the source. I'm not sure what your deal is or your beef, but the conversation was clear that day. I'm gonna opt out of this dialogue because you seem to want to spin or just remember things differently.
---
&gt;most of you think this post is whine(partially is) but I hope that new and some old players will realize that cutting prices in the market wont make your items sell with the speed of light.
---
New guy seems to think the only reason to tank a market is to sell fast :bigthonk:
---
So you want to be able to deploy at zero on a structure with no penalty or recourse? Dude could hop in the station and blap it.
---
So put ur main in a wh corp and place the krabalt(s) into a renting corp for the iskies.. 
---
Dude you're only talking about half of what he said - his concern that cyno inhibs would suppress content - and not the other half - that _they don't work at all and needed to be buffed._ How in the actual fuck can you possibly think that taking half of what he said out of context to prove the point you want to make is faithfully representing what he said?
---
you are a brilliant man and possibly the only entity in the universe who has understood how markets and taxes work. i congratulate you on your achievment and am honored to be in the presence of a GOAT trader.  
---
brisc 'titan main' rubal everybody
---
"cyno inhibs are fine! the issue is just that citadels, titans, and everything else in the game are broken! also gank dreks would not be forced off grid by supers with fibos because i said so, though I don't fly a super on my main that often so I might be wrong! "
---
That dude seems to have the worst of luck with drops :/
---
&gt;We somehow love that they've made the most complex game ever and **yet have no patience with them** while they try to work on it
---
It took them at least 10 years to admit wardecs were killing new players. After 16 years, they have no relevant automated bot detection, and they regularly ignore reports. They post no list of banned bots to ensure people cant verify the bans (I know for a fact bots that have been reported for at least a year are not banned). Svipul took two years to nerf. Links were not fixed until a few years ago after the community correctly pointed out problems since at least 2010. Injectors have serious issues, particularly when it comes to cap proliferation. They regularly ignore feedback despite asking for it. And it goes on.
---
You think they deserve a patient community at this point?
---
&gt;What's worse, when you just say "ccp is shit" regardless, it invalidates the very real issues people have with them because you've been crying wolf about shit that just doesn't work for you for so long.
---
The idea is that people are informed enough to have some kind of clue as to why CCP is "shit".
---
Not saying you have no experience market trading but when you've got over 600b on the market, you simply don't have the time to switch between all 5 characters managing each and every order. Even if he loses sales tax money from buying your stock, he will still make a profit once all of his stock sells. And to try and get his stock sold before you, he tries to undercut you to a point where you might want to wait for his stock to sell out before you sell yours. He doesn't have time to play the 0.1isk game with every order. When you have that much money on the market, just a 1 or 2% profit is already large enough.
---
All good feedback, thanks for the input.
---
Good to know that Jita is pretty much the only game in town for selling bulk, will save me the time and frustration you went through dealing with low volume hubs and cut right to the chase.
---
That's fine if the titans at least have to warp to grid first instead of just cynoing in 110km away and blapping the inhib :(
---
CCPls
---
I'd rather the bastion module be given the cyno inhib. Or a 30 second anchor time would work. 10s is too short. It's possible for someone in Australia to be lost to lag with only 10s
---
Oh. I always thought it was. But then again I am an old fart who played when it was shit and very refer people used it. They are very overpowered now and the super cap umbrella amplifies this problem.
---
He also talked about 50 other things that weren't related. They aren't topical. You want to talk about the shuttle guy wanting nullified shuttles too?  I am only talking about him saying they had concerns about the item and we're keeping an eye on it. That was my original statement that they were leery of putting it in game and how it would work out. That is factually accurate despite how you want to turn this into muh muh representation. Get off your soap box.
---
Polarized, definitely. Non-polarized? It's a bit of a stretch then
---
https://youtu.be/jYmn3Gwn3oI
---
what in hell does this have to do with the skill ceiling? you know the thing that the comment is about
---
I don't think anyone said Brave won't blob the everloving piss out of you at GE-. We just won't do it with caps. A giant pile of caracals is another story.
---
I dunno about that - [https://zkillboard.com/kill/73085962/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73085962/)
---
Doubt he got 160B for all the rigs and with that many probably have to reprocess them and sell the mats but still not a bad drop.
---
Isnt that what most peeps do tho?(Bragging about nonsense, that is)  
---
Also, i came back from my break roughly when the hk thing happened, they were inactive?   
---
Kinda sad to hear.
---
What does this even mean?  With everyone having caps, you either have to use them or make a rule that you don't use them in a specific region so that content is actually possible. 
---
Brave isn't a small gang "elite pvper" corp. It is a fledgling major corp that requires industry. Therefore they have a region (Impass) that is heavily protected by the biggest ships they own. Its also a newbie alliance that requires a safe area for newbies to learn the game and build up needed resources without being constantly harassed by people picking of easy kills.  Bitching about this is basically saying you are a filthy casual at this game since all you think is important is your leet small gang crap. It's a bigger game than that.
---
Brave allowing Catch to be a welcome mat to any neut that wants a fight without being dropped on is just plain good for the game at the moment.  But maybe you are right and gud fites shouldn't have rules... which means that right now you better roam with capitals if you don't want to get squashed in every region you go.
---
Did that happen to be a moa fleet? Cause the dude that dropped that nag on yall for being an asshats in local was the coolest.... 
---
If caps are nerfed so they cant apply to subcaps, the "abusers" will quickly consider other options. Blops are that option.
---
you're saying poor springheeled jack wasn't the init spy, it was you all along?
---
scandalous!
---
Wasn't whining, lol, just pointing out facts my dude.  I personally don't drop caps in Delve...look at my kill board "Kathy Iron" ...I lose small gang ships on the regular because I'm bad at pvp.  Either way it's like gang "debt".  One group does a thing so it justifies the other group doing a thing etc.  I figure that because I'm in PH's "house" they're gonna bring out the big toys like we tend to in Delve...which is our house.
---
Only if your roaming leads you to attacking rorqs and shit moon mining in Catch. That will earn you a cap drop to the face in a goddamn hurry.
---
On the other hand, if you roll up to the GE- gate in V-3 with a gang of subcaps and declare your intentions to brawl the locals will be happy to oblige.
---
You are New here!
---
You immediately lost all credibility the second you wrote the words safe area.
---
Maybe you should see how far you can cream those caps up your ass? Pretty far I'm guessing.
---
I dont buy that. It is better to restrict caps than to do nothing. Obviously other changes are also needed because of the damage injectors have caused.
---
The triple anci fits could survive 100 bombers for a while. Post nerf, no.
---
Ooof, did not see that one. Why the hell would anyone make that many capital expanders? That's just ridiculous.
---
Or renting. Oh wait, no renting is Not enough anymore.
---
Deleted panic, complete removal of HAW weapons and a butchering of fighter tracking.
---
I'm not saying these things are needed, fair, or "good balance", but that's what it would take to make me play EvE.
---
99.5% sure hes just really high effort bait tbh
---
I see your point but with these I also understand that you do it once or maybe twice and leave the item there. Im following this guy for the rigs I was talking about and everytime i adjust to his undercut he does it again and again. So far a good amount of 7-8 of them, stopped following in the hopes that he'll sell his stock faster then keeping to lower the price till it's not worth selling it.
---
B tier FCs get kicked.... 
---
HK is dying.
---
Jamal is dead.
---
Time to refocus on building up ram ranch.
---
Downvoted for “ceppy”
---
Feel free. I said you guys dropped caps like morons. I'm not saying we didn't take a few with us even though we were in frigs. Ya let that sink in. That's how trash you are.
---
As i get this issue is about dropping immediately within range of cap guns making the inhibitor trivial, because of a citadel hitbox issue. 
---
This post: Someone not understanding how markets work
---
welcome to reddit lmao
---
The issue is literally: We want to small gang fight and don't want people to escalate when we come into their space.
---
There is no safe area in Eve but you cannot expect a corp to not attempted to create one for themselves. Unlike others, Brave literally keeps one region unsafe.  So, what is the problem with that?
---
You killed the Alliance Tournament long before CCP did.
---
dude could hop in logi and 200iq play rep it
---
&gt;Rorqs are strategic assets
---
Are they? It seems they are basically players personal isk-printers at this point.
---
Because of inflation, it won't ever stop rising. As long as players keep getting richer, the prices will keep going up. 
---
"nuke"
---
You mean, nuke it, then wait 7mins, then watch as titans cyno in and faxes rep it up
---
I don't know what would make me come back tbh. I love Eve as a concept, but I have lost the joy that it once brought. I've been to fanfest, and I've been in the biggest alliances. I have stayed awake for 56 hours in a row to kill a titan and failed because they exploited the log off effects. I was apart of the first "biggest fight" in EvE B-R in 2014. 
---
3 things ruined Eve for me.
---
1) Too many Titans. It used to be that killing big things was fun. Now it's a chore. Their AOE DD was good way to stop blobs. Then people got around it. Tbh they should be more vulnerable (who decided they should be able to dock...), not less. Also, they should have always had grid limits along with AoE Ewar effects.
---
2) Too few reasons to fight. Alliances just NAP the hell out of each other. FW was some of the most fun I had post Titan nerf. Then it lost it's appeal due to CCP changes. Blobs are utterly dull. The best PVP was always 10 on 15 that ended up being 30 on 40 and then you win despite the numbers.
---
3) Real Life. Eve is dull in Asian timezones. This was the final killer for me. I tried a few times to get back in, but it's just boring mostly. Either you get a good fleet and no fights, or you get no fleet and everyone carries on making isk.
---
CCP can't fix 3, but they could go a long way on to making sure 1 and 2 get better.
---
I think they went the wrong way with supers, and rather than accepting that mistake CCP dug in to hard. The Keepstars are a poor joke as well. I know some love them, but they weren't anything I could get behind. They really just exacerbate the problem. Space should be hard and cruel, tough to live in. 
---
However, I have one request I would love for CCP to do. Enable weekly tournaments for different groups of people. Prizes could just be some Plex, entry fees could pay for it. Keep it mostly the same as AT standards, and invite people from the community to spectate, make commentary etc.
---
Killing a cyno inhib should require the defending force to first gain subcap dominance on the grid, change my mind
---
Inhib doesn't have the hp to survive a lot of dps in current state.
---
For my real life friends to not get greedy and literally try to usurp a corp wallet from me. 
---
I wonder what the thought process behind "can't anchor inhib next to citadel" is.  Seems to me that this restriction shouldn't exist.
---
"Found my first corpse. It's still warm, might use it."....
---
WINNER!
---
People forget that if this module will be OP next huge battle will never happen as just drop it in the middle of your capital/super fleet and no one can surprise you with a drop ... or drop one asap to block any reinforcements so only one side can have advantage.          
---
The problem is not in inhib ... but in panic and rorqual. 
---
You'd drop carriers too if you were killing a frig worth 5 titans or a few keepstars. Quit acting like you wouldn't.
---
I've got two titans, one for my main and one on an alt. Regardless, you're ignoring my point. 
---
The citadel here is the issue - it lets them park a cyno frigate in tether and unattackable on grid with the Rorqs. It lets them have a safe area to cyno in Titans within range of the Rorqs. Even if there were no Titans and it was just supers, they'd still be within fighter range and could tether up at will. The citadel is the issue.
---
Dreks can't defang a super? That's news to me, but okay. Then bring something that can, like Kikis. 
---
Hi if you could stop dropping blob battleships on single/pair destroyers in lowsec that'd be great thanks.
---
I loved EvE online but I left for 2 main reasons.
---
1) I reached my PVE goal (a carrier with enough isk to replace said carrier)
---
2)PvP was infrequent, long, and required commitment to be on at a certain time and to stay until the end.
---
As my real life changed I found I was not able to consistently log in, my log in time was dependent upon factors outside of the game, my play times where shorter, and that I wanted to get more sleep and thus staying up late on a roam waiting to get back prior to logging off was no longer possible.
---
I still have a strong feeling of loyalty to my corp and would love to come back, but unsure what i would do.
---
Having quick drop in PvP (not duels) that still some how matter would be awesome. In my time I have done wormholes and faction warfare, and enjoyed it. For some reason these got a bit stale and repetitive.
---
I'm honestly not sure what would get me back. but after writing this I think I'll go at least find out what the corp is up to these days.
---
Hahha
---
The abyssal mods on it were better than officer mods.
---
&gt;The ability for one side to simply deny the other side from participating
---
Subcaps don't exist anymore?
---
Can you point out to me where those groups have expressed public disgust with the new changes? If I missed it, I would like to see what they have to say. 
---
Everybody assumes they're in the majority. But I can safely say that you're not here. If you were, you'd have other people agreeing with you and you might have more than 71 karma. 
---
Troll, indeed. 
---
That's so sad I just met him :-(
---
Deep Thoughts, by Heil_Gaben.
---
Everyone exaggerates their income in Eve.
---
It's brisc, all he does is talk about stuff he has zero idea about as if he's an expert.
---
Between a year ago and now, when did you lose your sense of humor? 
---
Were you the Stain residents that did that in JAUD? I am pretty sure there were only 4 rorquals and the athanor cyno was lit by a rorqual, not by a titan.
---
My kids and job requiring less time and energy. Can't even log in atm, due to rl.
---
To add to the second point, most of the PvE is brain-numbing, and the most efficient way to farm it usually makes it *even worse*.
---
Tons of games have engaging PvE content, and Eve has a really solid combat system at its core.  How can it be so hard to build PvE that isn't a red-plus-clicking-simulator that can be played better by a drinky bird than a human?
---
The bar isn't even that high for Eve, because if something is in space where you can be caught and killed, and it's not possible to render that space completely safe, you're pretty much already creating conflict and excitement even if the mission is just "sit there for x minutes" as seen in FW.
---
I feel that Rise saying "we were worried about inhibs being oppressive" means something different given the context of "but we were wrong so we're buffing them." You can pretend it doesn't all you want, but your central premise is that CCP doesn't like inhib mechanics because it oppresses content - when they're on record saying that that concern was unfounded.
---
I don't know if arenas fit into your idea of "meaningful" ... but I'd sure like arenas. 
---
Tbh I just pulled the 10sec out of my ass.
---
But 10 sec (expect AU people apparently ^^) should enough for some that barely pays attention to lit up a cyno 
---
Our drek fleet defangs supers for sport, I mean if we aren’t getting a fight we are going to target your fighters cause we can 
---
Heh 
---
i dont mind the blobbing, its the 2-3 pete tengus and 3-5 200km nagas that ruin every fight. I can even deal with the falcons, but those long range ships when you are already having a fight, its rough
---
I don't know. Ask CCP?
---
Could a small gang deal with caps by having a bunch of clocked bombers trail them?
---
Ouch
---
Guess you're better off without them tho
---
thanks! i thought this was on singularity cause i didnt read! apologies
---
It’s okay, the greedy one raged salty tears and blocked me after I took the wallet and quit the game when I found out what the plot was.
---
&gt; red-plus-clicking-simulator
---
How long has it been since you last played?
---
What actually happened was we planned a long term op to kill HK's keepstar in their home staging, which most folks - including HK - believed was unkillable. 
---
During the week we did it, the typical propaganda wars started on reddit and the twitch streams. Instead of having fun with it, the WHers got hyper defensive, and developed this narrative that INIT are all Goons, it was all just a blob, HK was inactive and not very good anyway, they really only had 7 members all of whom multibox dozens of caps, and their fleet was killed in the WH because of a bug, not a mistake FCing. 
---
They especially like mocking me because I'm forced to interact with them because I promised them I would after they were incapable of electing a CSM member because they can't agree on anything. 
---
Now I just show up randomly in these threads because it's funny to watch guys like M2Dazas go nuts. 
---
Wow, you're only a month late!
---
This is great. 
---
Dafuck are you even talking about? I never said you wouldn't get blobbed in GE. Though that being said... I don't think 30 dudes in Caracals is a "blob" considering the size of Brave. Shit... That's just the size of the kitchen sink. But... I'm not the idiot bringing 10 jackdaws into a large corps staging system and whining about blobs either. 
---
Wasn't bastion the left over allies from failed alliances that Goons didn't want to let into the swarm? 
---
What's the point of having the bastion anymore when the doors to goons are wide open?
---
Legit solo too. Never had a cloaked Loki nearby or a blob waiting on the other side of a gate or an alt flying by to give boosts.
---
Spool up on cynos so that one team has to control grid before they can push one button and win.
---
A changing subcap meta
---
An AT again.
---
join sigs and squads. 
---
It’s a long time to be at a company, and he’s still young so he should def switch it up if he feels the call. 
---
Citadels shouldnt have ewar mids, plain and simple.
---
Make it have the option of cap stability or Scan res. 200km webs, incredibly strong TP's, OP as hell ECM is all dumb as hell. Even the limited time the webs are useable, it is still SUPER opressive.
---
Citadels already have incredible DPS and Capacitor Warfare capabilities, coupled with PDS and bomb launchers, why do they also have to be an unkillable Huginn?
---
They probably saw a lack of on the market so thought "this is my time to shine" 
---
Null sec blocks need newbies to not quit after joining their first corporation. 
---
Why are you in dreks with less then 100kehp?!
---
Should be triple neut, double Entropic Sink, rest is tank. Mids for cap, Tracking Computer and a point.
---
What fit are you using that cant hold?
---
When you say "I feel" followed by how you took it, is good communication. Then attacking me for stating my take away from it.. not so good. My central premise is that they are concerned with the overall power of it and are leery of making changes one way or the other. Any other statement or premise you want to insert is inaccurate and misleading. I stated my premise multiple times and referred back to their own statements that made me come to the conclusion. Anything outside of that is a knee jerk reaction to my flair or me not simply agreeing that yes inhib need much buff.
---
:(
---
&gt; What are we doing about The Bastion feeder corps?
---
Apparently they're all moving to Fountain.
---
Tbh there is little you can offer to a ganker at your level except one low skilled f1 pusher until you learned some of the game more. They usually multibox enough to get the things killed on their own. If you went and asked what can you do to be useful and get a share of the loot they will probably gove you an answer.
---
Then it's not a small gang.
---
I feel like that won't accomplish much, people will just continue with their current alliances doing the same stuff.
---
Has pve changed appreciably since those days though? With maybe a few exceptions I'd say no. 
---
Seems like a bit of a problem if the go to to kill a frig is drop a cap.
---
The AT. It's the only thing that can bring me back, frankly. I've never had as much fun in eve as the 3 years I was able to participate in the AT with RvB (okay, 2 and a failed attempt to get through feeders), despite the fact that we never made it particularly far. Also, it would be really great if u/ccp_falcon would actually give RvB our AT medals, but I know he won't. Can't count on that guy to do anything but lie through his teeth.
---
for me i felt trapped. with out being in the major alliances i see it as a face roll when ever a conflict emerges. i could be in a fleet of 100 caps and still know with absolute certainty that we would be destroyed by forces many magnitudes larger.
---
i feel the game has just grown too saturated with things. isk, caps, large singular power blocks. its not really a build your own adventure anymore as much as it is jump into the establishment and puts around a bit.
---
the amount of alts and bots also saps my excitement for the game. im not one to take things to that level, those who are have quite the advantage
---
i also feel structures are too easily killed, its very hard or impossible to defend a structure against large forces. numbers is all that matters
---
Disagree.
---
With the old normal grid sizes, a cyno inhib basically meant you couldn't drop anything on grid.
---
When grid size changed, cyno inhibs did not. A cyno inhib should lock down the fighting area.
---
Can you honestly provide a good reason why an inhib shouldn't have a 1000km range?
---
Im ignorant. What's cyno for?
---
It's not your fault. CCP has brought the game to this point. I guess I shouldn't be upset that you don't understand. All you know is. I'm platitude game.
---
I mean he presents it like I did, initially.   
---
However, you're also right, since he then says that if they were dropped on or off grid but out of weapons range it wouldn't matter since the defensive bubbles would've denied their approach.   
---
So yes - let's have a mobile cyno inhibitor that prevents cynos in a 200km range or so - so that then we can bubblefuck your response fleet and generally be able to kill our targets undisturbed.   
---
I stand corrected. 
---
Let me rephrase it, since you seem confused by my language. You're wrong that CCP is still concerned that inhibs stifle content. You're wrong in how you're representing Rise's comments. You're wrong in the entire argument you've laid out here. I *feel* that you're wrong because *you're wrong.*
---
buff rorqual yield and tank
---
Well that was a legitimate "welcome to fountain" but they have lost a few ships to gbt but then again everyone has in fountain.
---
Why shouldn't they be able to inhib the entire grid?
---
They have an anchor time in which the defenders have time to either light a cyno or destroy the inhib.
---
how do you autopilot to a bookmark
---
you botting piece of shit
---
I get it. In your opinion, supported by how you feel - I am wrong. I will make sure to agree with you and disregard the facts and commentary.
---
Those poor rorqual crew families
---
Taking a step back here, you are essentially complaining you can't wander into enemy space and lock it down with ease.    
---
  
---
People don't like how hard rorqs are to kill combined with the mechanics you mentioned, but that shouldn't invalidate those defensive advantages of owning/living in your sov.
---
So you want to PVE, but with results showing on zkillboard?
---
&gt; TL:DR - is hi-sec still relatively secure? 
---
Highsec is the most dangerous place in eve.
---
Knocked up if Hard
---
I miss you pavel we will come back soon
---
You can repackage the ships, put them in a hauler and move that way. Repackaging a ship will destroy it rigs, but unless they are T you don't really care about that.
---
Deets. What happened to Mcav, I always liked them
---
Fountain is right next door to Goons. With Init right there as well. 
---
That's exactly what the PvE should have been all along.  Think burners, except the burners themselves are the top or next-to-top level.  Re-cast the entire spectrum of mission content into mock-PvP situations, with buffer tanks and ewar, slingshotting, incoming hostiles, scanning, the whole shebang.  If you grind missions you should be ready to go out and start raising hell in lowsec.
---
Instead we click red symbols.  I'll admit I enjoyed flying a lumbering battleship around and unleashing laser hell on mindless drones, but that eventually got optimized out because it's just so much better to run missions in a way that's as boring as possible, they couldn't purposefully design it to make you hate the game more than the current system does.
---
All members of the imperium should do the same. deploy somewhere else, set up roots, make new enemies and change the state of the game.
---
Local removal or delay for nullsec followed by robocalypse of botting VNIs. 
---
You can always go in LS and roam around for PvP, or find a chill NS static WH group. 90% of my play time is just random roaming with my corp, it only escalate to a proper fleet when we catch something big.
---
That's the thing - I think they recognized that the old cyno inhibs were OP, and the grid size change fixed that problem without requiring a nerf. 
---
As for a good reason, I don't know if any reason I can speculate about would be considered "good," but the making them that large means it would be next to impossible for the target to have any kind of meaningful interaction with the cyno inhib, which is probably OP.  
---
We do our best to make rorqual saves interesting and exciting for others
---
Eh, the symbols changed, but the red plusses are burned into my mind.  Different jpegs didn't make missions or anoms any more engaging.
---
How do you get into building T2 Components? Is there a good walk through anyone will recommend? 
---
It's not salt to call salt, salt.
---
This is a non issue, there is already a tether delay which you can use to tackle caps. If you are needing g more help than that I suggest you not hunt un defended nullsec and hunt renters.  If Sabres get destroyed too easily then use hics there are options available to you whether you choose to use them or not is a decision you need to make. 
---
&gt;[15:41:04] Xenuria &gt; I just wanted to let you know that downvote brigading reddit threads won't bring back your keepstars. It's also against the rules and you can get in trouble for it.
---
I just want to remind everyone in this thread that downvoting shitposts is like bluefucking your local bots.  Don't do it without checking with your local goonswarm representative.
---
oh i forgot to mention that they should fix the economy first ofc. server reset wouldn't help without fixing the issues first. fixing the issue doesn't do much without server reset tho, the damage has already been done.
---
You stopped following him? Sounds like his strategy worked as intended.
---
The downvotes mean you're in the clear, Brisc
---
No clue how inactive HK was, or is.  
---
I can see the validity of the blob-argument tho.  
---
Not saying thats a bad, or a good thing, but you cant deny that the numbers were largely in your favor.  
---
Also, forced to interact with them? Doesnt sound like you like your csm"job" very much lol.
---
ok retard
---
Wow really? You are obviously a fairly sad human 
---
&gt; Is the long term state of the game currently predicted to stay in a healthy state under the new ownership?
---
Nothing has transpired from being under influence of PA. Skill injectors were a thing long before PA bought CCP, and and CCP is perfectly able to fuck their own game on their own don't worry about that.
---
Never known falcon to lie so citation needed. 
---
 \- hits blunt -
---
&gt; I'd rather the bastion module be given the cyno inhib. Or a 30 second anchor time would work. 10s is too short. It's possible for someone in Australia to be lost to lag with only 10s
---
This was brought up before in another post and was deemed to have any point in doing that.
---
The proper fix would be to make the Cyno have a spool up timer so atleast the attacks have a chance to stop the immediate titan bridge. 
---
ESS mechanics should be revived and be permanent structures at the sun of every nullsec system
---
If you buff inhibs like that, it would therefore stand to reason that they would be larger in m3.... then you reduce the number of ships that could even carry one into a fight...  
---
&gt; it would be next to impossible for the target to have any kind of meaningful interaction with the cyno inhib, which is probably OP.
---
That just isn't true though.  You can light a cyno whilst the inhib is anchoring.
---
Alternatively you can still cyno a fleet into system and have them warp to the grid - which is what people used to do in the old system.
---
This provides a counter to the counter which is fair. If you as a defender can't organise a fleet and a cyno in the system you're tackled in within the time it takes for your PANIC to run out or your tank to break then that seems like a fair kill for the attackers no?
---
I mean if he was wrong, they wouldn't be mass downvoting him.
---
I wish people would stop being complainers and actually generate content versus waiting on someone else to create content for them.
---
Time
---
Eh? Why would it have to increase in m3?
---
Think before you type. Imagine fleet movements with cyno inhibs on citadels. 
---
just
---
cute to see Tridgit Little alli all grown up
---
Unlike some folks, I try to do what I tell folks I'm going to do. I told the WH guys that I'd rep their issues for them when they didn't get a candidate on to CSM this time, and I've tried to do that, even when they spend most of their time calling me a retard and spitting in my face. 
---
At least minerals are cheaper
---
you cant prove that, you cant even understand the complexity of a blue print copy. lmao.

Good luck dumbo

Stuck in the bubble with you
---
We are awaiting their arrival through the y-2 gate. We're ready to play games!
---
The priorities of MiniLuv are as follows:

1. Gank freighters that are owned by entities hostile to the Imperium.
---
2. Gank freighters for profit.  
---
3. Gank random miners for fun.
---
.  
---
39. Infiltrate tiny pubbie corps and camp their bookmarks.

It is against Imperium policy to set members' neutral corps blue.

Can we get an AAR?
---
&gt; **To those who left or that are bored shitless of EVE,**   
---
&gt; What would it take for you to come back and/or have fun again?  
---
Make Rorqs and supers rare, limit areas of the game they have access to. Get rid of AFK VNI ratting, AFK anything. Get rid of botting and kick multiboxing in its teeth. Redesign a whole bunch of combat mechanics and return the game to be smaller scale, primarily sub caps. Redesign a lot of the ways the economy works so that optimal corp / alliance size becomes small / medium, the bigger it gets the more difficult, not easier it becomes to sustain economically.
---
lots of things but for me it essentially boils down to: there is no point in fighting for anything:
---
- make it a lot harder to gain ISK, especially wrt. the absurd ISK printing in null through Rorqs and supercaps. Losses AND wins have become completely meaningless
---
- revert this whole "null has to be self sufficient" BS. The different security zones used to depend on one another; there was excellent and terrible space in Null. Nowadays everthing is more or less the same or in other words: BOOORING
---
Whoa!!!  You mean I wouldn't have a completely safe cyno chain?!?!  I might have to shoot an anchorable?!?!  It might be possible to do something like waterboarding to capital fleets??!?!  How terrible!!!!
---
:eyeroll:
---
Dude, given your line of work of course you will think everyone can represent everyone. Money and personal interest talks for you. You are not in politics to solve problems. You may have lots of practice in your country's shitty version of representative democracy. You don't know anything about it's shortcomings. Your very livelyhood depends on those shortcomings.
---
Look at how you go on and on about my background without ever engaging with the argumenta itself. And before that your main point was how I must hate democracy because I argue against your take on it. You do have lots of experience in ad hominem politics and demagoguery.
---
More named systems in Syndicate
---
It's very true, but someone somewhere is going to complain about either side of every change. CCP, with all the discernment of a four year old, wouldn't know who to listen to
---
You mentioned a seemingly viable strategy for placing cyno inhibs around a citadel but in the same thread say it's worthless to try. Granted it isn't an ideal strategy but it worked for us when we killed a bunch of FRT Rorqs. I just had like 6 cyno inhibs on grid.
---
If the problem is the cyno frigate then bring a long range high alpha ship (like a Naga or Tornado) and have that person spam lock on the cyno frigate. Maybe it dies before anything gets a chance to cyno in.
---
When something doesn't go the way you want it to because you're not willing to or otherwise aware of viable strategies you can't just scream to change mechanics to make the game catered to your playstyle.
---
If you want to kill Rorquals, you need to deal with how well defended they are. Theres plenty of undefended capital ships in the Drone lands. Why not have a go there?
---
Warp to instadock bookmark, set autopilot to the station, it docks as soon as you land
---
Ez instadock
---
no i mean i know reddit is a nasty place but I was really acknowledging your were right :)
---
The thing is I don't see much of a difference, whether it's 1000km or 100km.  In this instance, the issue wasn't that the defender couldn't organize a fleet and a cyno in the system - he did that. It was that the attackers couldn't deal with the response. 
---
Would anything in OP's scenario have changed if the cyno jammer worked at 1000km? 
---
Phew. I was worried. I really don't want these guys to hate me for something I had nothing to do with, after all. 
---
A reversal of injectors to begin with. From there, who knows... since the first wont happen. 
---
Could you imagine the amount of trolling on every citadel in the game? Oh you want a cyno on your Keepstar? Come kill this piddly deployable first.
---
I am way different then most on reddit I am sure - but I would like *interesting* PvE content I can get into without having to drop tons of isk for specific ship designs/loadouts for each type of encounter.
---
that is not what this dude is implying
---
Capital Interdictor: built on the Marauder chassis, with a module that can be scripted to inhibit either warps or jumps. If possible, toss in an 'interference effect' that prevents them from operating within *x* meters of another (to reduce the bubblefuckery a touch).
---
The game really needs a way for corps and alliances to grow and fight entities of their own size along the way.  The problem now is eventually you reach a point where you become big enough to end up on the radar of groups who are bored and want to use their big toys and will constantly drop titans and supers on you until you are either dead or join a "side" that might actually be able to counter drop them.   When that happens, they just look for the next biggest baby seal to club.   When a group joins a side, they effectively give up everything that made them different and those players tend to leave, as if they wanted to join "super bigger group A", they would have already directly joined that group.
---
I want content that is fights and not ganks.
---
I understand that Eve is not about fairness. Good, better numbers or better ships win. I spent my time in nullsec.
---
But why can't we have a little piece of the galaxy carved out for actual fights? Why can't we have FW focused on fair duels with no chance of getting ganked 30vs1? Where fights are fought as advertised without the inevitable 30 men gang waiting around the corner.
---
Yes, they would have have to drop caps off grid and warp them within range of the inhib to kill it.
---
This also gives the opportunity to start bubbling towards the cyno to prevent warp-ins reaching the grid safely.
---
The end result may not have been entirely different in this case but it changes the dynamic of the counter drop
---
We enjoy killing them in Fcore, stop lying
---
Literally just a line member -- I pointed out our reactions to acknowledge that yes, we were pissed at the dude, but no we didn't just let him die. 
---
Waaa I'm a wormholer and don't have supercaps
---
I can't believe it! I won't tell anyone. Also, I think it might be easier of people were willing to just come out and say what they want without doing 50 bullet points and hoping people draw the same conclusion like it was obvious.
---
Regardless, the point stands.
---
Pretty sure they’re warpable and not worth the cost. 
---
its almost like you didnt read my post. the way the anchor mechanics work the inhibited are cannot reach all places a cyno can be lit inside the citadel model. in short...a citadel is not inhibitable
---
OP is complaining that, even with definite local fleet superiority (presumable enough to even attack the Athanor itself if they wanted to), they are mechanically blocked from layering a cyno inhib over a specific spot in space (the one with the Athanor in it). This isn't a "with ease" situation, as they'd presumably be fine with trying to keep that inhib up under Rorq and citadel fire, and they aren't talking about trying to prevent the cyno frigate from lighting somewhere in system but off-grid, nor at a ping.
---
No way... yesturday we had a talwar gang that killed so many of our ships. Even managed to kill a carrier too.
---
Shouldn't this be deleted due to a lack of aar?
---
I agree that it changes the dynamic of the counter drop, but I don't think it changes that much. You warp directly to grid from the cyno, you know you're gonna get caught in a dozen bubbles along the way, so a competent group won't do that. 
---
I see your point, though.  I still think it's the citadel here that makes this the issue, but I don't really have a problem with expanding the grid size of a cyno inhib. 
---
A group that wasn't my nemesis at some point of my career holding sway somewhere. But tha'd be step 1.
---
If hard, knock up
---
I think we could agree that a beefy, strong structure shouldn't be easily transported.  
---
Maybe the compromise would be large and small inhibs? Smalls keep their current range but are resistant to capital size guns, a Large would significantly expand range, deployment time and reduce its portability.
---
&gt; the box is open, ... Rorquals have killed the game's future.
---
How to fix:
---
Step 1) Nerf Rorqs 
---
Done. 
---
The injectors are money for ccp directly, so yeah I agree with you there, but I mean come on. Meta ship is too meta, nerf it. 
---
Remember when it was drakes? Nerfed 
---
Remember when it was ishtars? Nerfed
---
Remember when it was caps everywhere? Ok too soon. 
---
But start with the mechanism that allows for proliferation of risk removal, which is everyone being a bazillionaire. 
---
or disallow caps in lowsec again
---
Shit... I didn't even know Gaurd was in Bov. 
---
Blood for the Blood God!
---
ofc it's a goon that says that holy shit what a time to be alive. 
---
in null sec, you're defending your sovereignty. Your job isn't to help others find content, but to deny their incursion into your territory.
---
In what way
---
Look I found a retard.
---
Certainly but I can wait till he sells out.
---
No local would definitely tempt me back. Anything that adds the adventure of the unknown.
---
I'd actually be all for this, but I don't see it happening.
---
Nerfing a ship that is a combat ship is a huge difference to a ship that spits out raw materials.
---
There was a hard cap on how much ore one account could create before the rorqual buff. There's _so much_ ore out there now that it could take years to bring the mineral values back to pre-rorq days and the damage has been done through super and Titan proliferation. By changing it now all you do is crystallise the disparity.
---
I'm not saying don't nerf it. Obviously, it needs to happen. But it won't fix the problem and it won't reduce the issues it has caused.
---
I'm likely one of the oldest players still around, but what made me end my seven (*cough* nerd) subscriptions after 15 years in the game is the fact that there really isn't any danger left. There is no feeling of immediacy or consequences for any action anymore. 
---
I have never really chased Eve wealth as a goal in and of itself, never felt that cornering a market or maximizing profit was a necessity for enjoying the game. I just wanted enough to buy the ships I needed to go out and have fun in. With that said, even I have somewhere around 170bill in assets that have built up over time. Not that much in the grander scheme, and I have no titans or supers. But the fact that I can accumulate so much wealth without really pursuing it points to the larger problem.  
---
If I lose a ship, no biggie. I have another. So the first rule of Eve is not something I ever think about anymore. 
---
So, there is so much money in the game that where any halfway competent corp or alliance is concerned there are no economic consequences for any loss. Any thing blown up is replaced already, its not just a meme anymore. This also means there's no such thing as a 'win' its just another fight that doesn't matter. The losing sides in the biggest fights over the past several years mostly suffered no lasting consequences. Get kicked out of a region? Move somewhere else and come back stronger. Lose more titans in one fight than anyone else? They'll be replaced in a few weeks. Null bloc combat is just fucking boring.
---
With injectors and supercap proliferation I don't see that there is any way back. For instance, at the end of beta, there was Armageddon day, at that time it was the most fun I had had in Eve. Kill everything in sight, burn it all down. I died a lot, lost everything, worth it. 
---
I don't think that would work again, with PLEX and injectors it would take no time to rebuild. So my Eve career is ending. 
---
I can make ganker Catalyst alts any time I feel like pissing people off. Why bother paying for anything?
---
LSH batphoned BL over a Solitude group’s anchoring Fortizar that has good jump range over Aridia. BL showed up in Munins, Iron/Bums/NSH/VOID brought a Leshak fleet and dropped carriers. 
---
BL dropped dreads, the Iron group counter dropped their dreads + a few supers and a titan. 
---
Fortizar lived, fun fight was had.
---

---
&gt;You warp directly to grid from the cyno, you know you're gonna get caught in a dozen bubbles along the way, so a competent group won't do that.
---
True, but it already separates the men from the boys and creates some additional kill opportunity. A less competent group might feed some initial support caps warping directly to grid, or the time it takes to get a safe warp-in can allow the attacker to maybe kill one of the initial targets.
---
All of these things are better than a safe drop onto a grid to immediately kill the content. 
---
CCP clearly have no appetite on scaling back Citadels or the utility so things like Cyno Inhibs need to be brought up to date to mitigate for lost content.
---
Eve is more fun when it's played with friends.
---
Not to rag on solo pilots, but new players especially benefit from having friends and a support network to help them learn the ropes. 
---
To be fair, this is reddit, people do that to each other all the time?  
---
But would you trust someone with your issues or suggestions, that doesnt play in your "niche", and even goes as far as invading that niche, then bragging about it?  
---
(Not saying you did something "wrong" or "right", but i can certainly understand why people wont take your offer seriously, or ridicule it)
---
I had an idea for an arena citadel a while ago, a citadel with what looks like a warp disruption bubble stuck too it, you enter citadel, and undock into the bubble with a pairing of your choice, you pair of the guest list. And you fight. People can sit outside the bubble and watch. Ships inside the bubble have floating hp and effect box above them.
---
Same with the Marshal
---
It's not just my line of work, it's also my experience and the experience of most folks over the history of representative democracy. Your disagreement doesn't negate the fact that in every representative democracy, whether in the US or elsewhere, the elected official is required to represent the whole of the constituency, not merely those who voted for him or her, or who participated in the election. That's the entire point of it.  You can't have representative democracy where the representative only represents the people who elected them and no one else. That's not how it works. 
---
I know plenty about the shortcomings, but I recognize that there are plenty of ways to combat those shortcomings, from laws restricting self dealing to transparency so folks can see where the money is coming from, and the like. I've had to file so many transparency forms, whether as a candidate, a public official or as a lobbyist it's scary. There's an entire body of law designed to help address the shortcomings. And you act like it's not even there.
---
I go on and on about your background because that's an important factor in your views and experience on the subject matter. You can't honestly claim that you know more about this than I do, but you did anyway. Say what you want about ad hominems and like, but come on dude. You know you're full of shit at least in that regard. 
---
exactly, in a scenario where the jammer inhibits 1000km the one jammer we already had on grid with the rorqs would have inhibited the citadel too...completly. other measueres to defend the rorq would have been needed. I described them too. I was hoping I sad all this above but it seems gameplay mechanics are hard...or its my bad english
---
i am not saying 1000km is good number. i am just saying the current iteration is in a bad place
---
Couldn't have said it better myself. Basically when cyno-ing in 3 titans and 2 supers to deal with a 4 man cruiser gang is a viable option you know the game is fucked and a huge amount of content is gone 
---
Nah, it's a shift in attitudes where now we have half the game (or at least half of those invested enough to post here) expecting end game level PvP when they're only capable for forming an 8 man micro gang. 
---
Small scale PvP should really be a gateway drug into bigger fights. That's how you capture people and keep them loving Eve for the long term. Instead, low level PvP is dominated by risk averse autists flying blinged out shit and feeling elite because their snake set lets them outrun the newbee and his handful of buddies looking for a good time.
---
I blame the eSports slant the game has taken recently, any why I'm hoping we might see the old style AT replaced with something better resembling a test of fleet combat skils that actually decides the fights that matter. 
---
Nah it was a bit ago.  We were in mostly assfrigs.
---
Make to mechanic to stop cloacky campers
---
I think this is just dancing around the issue of the panic module, which is the real problem with the rorqual.
---
lol. I was gas mining in the adjacent system and wondering about the parade of BL and IA pilots flowing in and out. Thanks for posting.
---
I think beast moved to NOVAC if it's the same one
---
Reset the server! Problem is existing groups will just reform. But the space race will be cool. 
---
It must've been critical
---
And what of the defender here? They have committed isk to grid in their structure and owning the space they live in. Home field advantage means nothing then?
---
Seemed clear enough to me. I think people are arguing over the wrong thing by talking about the potential end result of this particular example.
---
&gt;There's so much ore out there now that it could take years to bring the mineral values back to pre-rorq days and the damage has been done through super and Titan proliferation.
---
So start now lol otherwise the problem gets worse. Nerf the fuck out of rorqs, and increase the material cost on dreads and up? Or maybe on everything idk. 
---
I agree though, this isn’t an easy fix, but I do think the sooner ccp starts, the sooner markets and supply can normalize. 
---
Or add a ship or mod that negates panic or something. This allows blops or other whale killers to be effective before cap spam. Maybe you don’t get all 14 rorqs, but you get one. Add a little risk. 
---
Idk I’m no expert at all, but seems like there’s some low hanging fruit that could address or at least mitigate some of these issues. 
---
People have been asking for easy-access small scale PVP arena for years. People who want to spend their ISK on single / small-gang combat without the prospect of inevitably being blapped by a HIC + supercarrier each time you jump a gate.
---
There's an equally loud group of people who think this is incredibly un-eve-like who think that if you want a short fight you should be forced to roam 60+ jumps for it.
---
It's one of the sacred cows CCP needs to hurry up and slay.
---
Nah, put em on the heavy combat hulls; abaddon and friends could use a t2 version
---
Im mostly bummed to not be able to get those skill points. As a brand new player, they would have been really nice. Though I'm still excited for the client in general. I hope the test goes well!
---
LMFAO 7 years later, And Code is still only relevant around Jita.
---
I mean how could you be soooooo bad at a game and be so proud of it lololol
---
AAR:  Void/BUMS anchoring fort in Harner solitude.  BL shows up to kill in Munnins.  Defenders form armor carriers with triage support and cyno in 200 or so off the enemy fleet.  Cyno inhib is anchored.  
---
BL brings in dreads—fax machines and carriers start exploding.  Defenders respond with more dreads, including a wing of long range phoenixs and a pair of paddy wagons.  JF lands on fort as repair finishes.  This battle station is now fully operational.
---
Brawl ensues with all BL dreads eating shit.  However, munnins are annoying and several caps remain tackled.  Extract is eventually successful with one poor soul making the ultimate sacrifice.
---
Relatively even fight in terms of isk.  Good fun all around.
---
🧂🧂🧂
---
Any other members of the blue sprinkles alliance TM
---
Some kind of tradeoff to being in a large fleet. Warp/align speed disrupted by concentration of multiple warp drives in same area or something perhaps, something that makes smaller groups nimbler and harder to catch in exchange for being completely helpless next to any nullsec group that has hit the point of runaway growth and can multibox smaller groups into submission without skill.
---
Along with those lines, require two ships for lighting a cyno.
---
its literally useless, its literally slower than a naga, a talwar does everything better, literally everything. Its a thrash useless ship. same with the caracal navy issue, complete utter thrash. Could you whisper the slight suggestion of buffing these pair of useless shits into a ccp dev pls? 
---
Being able to pay for my accounts in game because I'm poor as fuck but I got no rorqual or carrier
---
You're totally right, but nerfing rorquals also hits CCPs bottom line. Huge numbers of AFK accounts? That's their dream gravy train.
---
There's lots of improvements to be made 
---
They won't happen. Look at the faux rebalance. Pulled at the last minute despite being sorely needed, and now nowhere on the roadmap. Rorquals aren't even being talked about, so good luck with getting progress there.
---
Like I said you can try and put it back in the box but the damage has already been done. 
---
I'd come back if the rorqual panic module was deleted. Bonus points if citadel damage cap and perhaps asset safety were removed.
---
Do corp votes count for something in hk? Last time we had one we voted to be a holdfast corp, so I made them evict dura lexx again.
---
They cost 45 mil and despawn after 1 hour...
---
The death of n+1 warfare.
---
Spod for the spod brain!
---
I imagine such a thing would have come in very useful in X47, after we'd spent the best part of a month destroying ihubs to prevent system-wide cyno jamming.
---
One of you please think it through, for a change.
---
There is already arenas in Trig space, and it is highly underused.
---
A new shard ... from scratch. 
---
No one can stop you from forming and cynoing from offgrid you fucking mong you can literally counter this all by just lighting the cyno off grid and bridging/jumping whatever the fuck you want, not to mention just lighting the cyno before the deployment of the inhib finishes. or the radical idea of a subcap response, the defenders still win if they're competent but right now the defenders win if they're not but happen to have 3 people ready to dickswing 
---
I should have said 'along Marauder lines'; give 'em a Bastion so they don't get Alpha'd immediately.
---
If you can’t find a safe spot in a system to drop your fleet then what does that say about you.
---
All these things were true long before injectors and Rorquals. You cannot blame this on them.
---
AFK accounts?  You have obviously never operated a Rorqual.
---
I just need time. I miss EvE, I miss the people, but I'm not a functioning adult when I'm involved with internet spaceships. 
---
I was mainly solo PVE (no time and constancy for corp) so for me to return i need:
---
\- redone mission system with some random variety of enemies and environments
---
\- also most important "scalable pve content" where almost anything can be done by 2-3 players and everyone of them will get better rewards doing that than alone
---
\- npc improvements (jump or decloack into field not spawn from nowhere), more important npc's, officers, factions etc should be marked in some way and have something like holo messages and scream when they die, also when hard npc jump in there should be some short alarm sound and message like "warning! incoming deadly treat detected"
---
\- some kind of hard end game high sec content where You really need faction fitted marauder to do it
---
\- more variety of usefull ships in pve not Gila online, i dont use battlecruisers because why?
---
\- fixed resource wars... also ring and comet mining
---
\- some variety in PI
---
\- more station interiors, and variety of systems like twin star systems and all cosmic phenomenas, more variety of nebulas (especially those almost only dark in HS, not that rainbow online)
---
\- more factions to play, precursors are cool but maybe also some aliens, lost terrans, robotic faction etc
---
\- rescaling eve (hundreds of meters ships and they feel like toys)
---
\- WIS
---
Yeah i know that game isnt for me ;)
---
Make the module cost say, 10 billion.  Then give it god-like jamming abilities.  
---
Honestly more space, new adventures, more lore. We only really learn something new every 6 months or so and it's been what, how many years and no real conclusion to this drifter thing? 
---
IDK, back In the day Eve was exciting because of the unknown, but everything is pretty much known now. Just meta's seem to change. "Player driven content" is a lame excuse for a galaxy of potential. We need more space to spread out with more unique traits, and that space should have their own stories. 
---
Yeah yeah we have abyssal and wormholes, but they're not connected really, adding another 5k systems to the known universe on the outskirts would be awesome, and spark so much exploration and gathering of information. 
---
Eve should be constantly expanding. And it really hasn't since the introduction of Black Rise, which I think was the only region addition in the game. 
---
 ^ Good example of being triggered.
---
To be fair, a carrier would do nothing to this guy if he wasn't already hard tackled by a subcap
---
I would do it.
---
Would make most keepstars pretty much invulnerable.  Lock down the system with inhibs, force the enemy to jump off-grid, fuck them with bubbles all night long.  Done.
---
It says you've never been in a capital fleet fight before.
---
Yes, it's underused for many of the reasons that have been discussed here, mainly the limited ships which can handle the PVE element before.
---
Even severely underused, yesterday it sunk about 16 billion in single combat. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kills/abyssalpvp/
---
When it first came out that was clocking hundreds of kills, until people got bored of the pve element.
---
Ehhh, ok I can dig it.
---
Having CSM, or a focus group of one sort or another is not the issue. The issue is that the CSM "as is" and as it has been for a long while is grossly misrepresenting playerbase at large therefore naturally player concerns and issues get misrepresented when presented to CCP. 
---
A good recent example:
---
Game has too many Rorqs, too much AFK stuff in it, too much botting, too much cap proliferation etc.
---
Nerf interceptors to eliminate one of the few remaining tools to make the above even worse, instead of going in exactly opposite opposite direction.
---
Also, while r/Eve is focused on and from big blocks, these are actually not the majority of players in Eve Online, but the CSM and game development seems to be focused on them. Sure, some knee jerk reactionary small stuff has been put into the game for the rest to stem the bleeding of these players, but its way too little and too late. Increasingly more people are getting sick and tired of the big blocks playstyle and leaving the game because of it.
---
Delete drones?
---
Delete hisec. 
---
^ good example of the average redditor who doesn't have a counterargument so just claims triggering on my behalf, yes i am so mad that you're absolutely clueless on how this game works... 
---
But you aren't disputing you were triggered. Nice try. You win a biscuit.
---
BUT HE'S SUPER DEEP SPY WHO KNOWS WHAT BASTION IS DOING. OP CANCELLED. DEEP SPY REVEALED MOVE. 
---
Twice the players, or half the space, or a rework of resources to promote conflict and interaction like either of those would... plus, of course, balance iteration.
---
Because the LP store is linking to the blueprint basetype.  A BPC is a particular instance of the basetype with a runcount.  
---
There are some circumstances when a linked BPC shows the basetype, which appears as an original, instead.  You mostly see it in older contracts.
---
While the BPO basetype for a slicer exists because that's how BPs are stored, there's no (legitimate) player-obtainable slicer BPO in the game.
---
I absolutely read your post. I referenced parts of it where you said that inhibiting a citadel is nearly impossible. How big of a diameter is the docking ring of an Athanor? I'm fairly certain that a cyno inhib in each of the cardinal directions would cover it in the inability to light a cyno anywhere within tether range.
---
 If not then the tactic of instalock instablap works just as well. You could kill him in the time it takes to say "cyno up". But then it encourages the use of bigger ships. And brings you into a new phase of outthinking your opponent.
---
Have you been to the Drone Lands?
---
remove ganking and pvp completely from high sec.
---
bann all bumbers and all other shitheads that try to destroy peoples time.
---
there is enough space in low and high sec.
---
the fact that it takes one 10 million ship to destroy a 1 bill barge is enough proof that risk and reward is totally broken.
---
and lets not start on freigther kills .....
---
also wardecs in high sec are again so broken. why should a 50 person corp that does nothing then destroy other peoples life be allowed to wardec a one person corp of happy and peacefull indus and miners?
---
i know getgut... eve is not a game for people like me jadajada ....
---
thats the reason i stopped paying for it.
---
but you asked for whould it take for me to return.
---
I liked where they dropped T1 carriers at 100km from a frigate to 'keep them safe' heh.
---
We just need 18 cowboys with a particular disdain for garments.
---
Changes in Faction Warfare. 
---
do i need to put the /s behind that sentence to get you to understand sarcasm? Go mine some more spod your brain clearly lacks some minerals
---
In EVE items won't move themselves. You can:
---
1. Fly them manually to your new home.
---
2. Repackage them and stuff them in an industrial ship and haul them yourself.
---
3. Repackage them and sell the hulls where they are and buy new ships at your destination.
---
4. Make a public courier contract so a freighter pilot can haul them for you.
---
6. Choose a combination of the above.
---
That one was never in MCAV.
---
Which is a shame. It would have been interesting to see someone out sperg Tiny.
---
They very much so could deal with the response though if it were 1000km off. Outlined in the OP about Sabres bubbling if caps had to come from off grid. 100km is in shooting range, 1000km is not, plain and simple. Acting like those are the same...?
---
I told you promoting Viktor was the dumbest idea in the world.  While you were eating your Wheaties every morning growing up he was killing corps. You didn’t listen this is just too good. As an ex member of shekle I saw first hand what the manbun horror did to us. Steel was a saint who didn’t do anything wrong I will never forget the keyboard 9/11. He was smart by keeping the shares viktor would have baited out all of his friendlies caps and then ganked them with an opposing force. The only reason it took months for shekle to die was due to steels expert diplomacy and forward planning. Viktor is the worst person in all of C5 space. i wouldn’t touch his elegant manbun face with a 20ft pole if I had too. It is a dark time over in HK that is for sure, but they brought this in themselves. The only bad thingthat I see coming from this is that TDSN and Pospy are now the number 1 and 2 Corp in wh space. With hk now gone neither of them are going to be able to copy/paste ship fits and actually start using those ridges in their brains causing a massive explosion in the space time continuum. How the smooth brains at turbohawks and No Brains allowed them to amass that much power is a whole other story in it self. I stake my reputation on this you will see a combined fleet of the two largest corps in wh history finally undock and use capitals correctly then it will over for the last bastions of good fights in c5 space. I will leave you all with that and I pray to our lord and savior that the garbage can coalition never graces your wormhole in the future.
---
Typically if people run or upship, it is because you brought cancer to a kids birthday party.  Stop trying to elite pvp everyone to death and you might get that fight.
---
&gt;Small scale PvP should really be a gateway drug into bigger fights
---
Except big fights fucking suck
---
Lol @ comments about a nado. So people use a maller instead.
---
No, people are still doing the PvE element.  They are choosing to not do the PvP element, because of risk adversity.  
---
The PvP opportunity is there.  People don't do it because they might lose their shiny ship.  They are more than willing to use a shiny doing PvE.  That is the very definition of risk adverse behavior.
---
\#pospyknew
---
I’m interested in how many kill marks you had on that hull before it popped?  Being so active with a shiner ship like that is what makes me smile about eve pvp.  Love the activity, will mourn your loss, great story for any gaming nerds.
---
You don't need 1000km range, even 200-250 works fine to prevent citadel cynos and caps jumping close enough to be super spooky. If you see a titan jump onto grid 200km off you have plenty of time to bubble it up to keep it from interfering
---
What would prevent someone just from just manning the the citadel and killing it?
---
I have a pilot in corp who did nothing but small gang in Catch and got over 1,000 kills in the Brave standing fleet last month. You're full of shit.
---
It has been a fucking viable option for the entire life cycle of eve, stop being a stupid shithead.
---
&gt;please contact Halfirien via Discord with your suggestion/request/need

Don't stress about getting dreads Halfirien can help.

---
It wasn't my Idea, It was -S-F-'s Idea... I SWEAR!!
---
Then Eve might not be for you, sorry.
---
Also, if the Rorqs are spread out in a belt (i.e. if they're actually mining independently and not multiboxing and/or botting), your theoretical competent group can now just burn a few cyno ceptors all around the grid, get a FAX within range of a couple of them with the current cyno mechanics. Right now, it takes several inhibs (and, for smaller groups, several FAX to keep them alive) to cover a belt. The sole saving grace, and reason that Rorqs die at all under a super umbrella, is that nobody's completely, or even usually, competent under stress. Lower case panic is the only real counter to PANIC.
---
I like this. Perhaps the "XL Mobile Cynosural Inhibitor" could only work on ships jumping but still allow bridging of subcapital ships. It has an increased range of 500km and is bigger in m3 while the "Small Mobile Cynosural Inhibitor" maintains its compact size as well as its current limitations.
---
CCP to fix the injector/alt/alpha problem. 
---
It will sell faster if he undercuts by big amount as other sellers (who already have paid big taxes for their high prices) will hesitate to undercut him or will buy him out completely. 
---
The easiest thing would be to have knock-on effects of inhibitors on citadels.  If Player A successfully deploys an inhibitor that includes a citadel in its area of influence, have the citadel set up its own interference zone, perhaps of twenty or fifty kilometers.  Players in ships can still deploy cynosaural beacons nearby, but they will have to fly outside of range if they were not quick enough off the mark to deploy before the inhibitor went up.  Ships can still jump to a nearby beacon, but will approach the citadel for a least a little time outside of tether range at sub-light speed.
---
okay thank u very much
---
viktor you are the dumbest person in all of hard knocks, even hk members say it, and that is hard to beat with all the other newcomer retards that came after braxus backstabbed and banned noobman

Im apping to nocac next btw

okay thanks v much

If my end game, high level aspiration as a PVP player is to push F1 in tidi then you're right, EVE isn't the game for me anymore.
---
It's physically impossible to anchor inhibs to prevent a cyno at 0 on a citadel because you have at best a 25km overlap
---
Also the 15 minutes it would take you to get all the precise perches to anchor around a citadel would defeat the entire fucking purpose of reducing the amount of time the enemy has to effectively respond.
---
t. F1 monkey
---
I mean it's a dozen or so.
---
Well it sure isn't for me anymore considering I haven't played in nearly a year. But to imply that eve is only good for big fights is idiotic, I played and enjoyed the game for years without being in one and so did a lot of people
---
They found her body face down, dead in the rain
---
Such a shame
---
Such a pretty face never should have felt this pain
---
at this point inconveniencing him is more fun than causing him fiscal damage
---
Someone made an oopsie.
---
I understand the injection issue. But what about the other 2. Elaborate please?
---
Someone would just warp a carrier onto it. Or if it's 1DQ, a titan.
---
Get better bad ideas thanks
---
It's kinda what I hate about the game at the moment, Capitals are pure AIDS juice and every other retarded alliance/coalition uses it to drop and anything because if they can't overkill it's too dangerous ya know.
---
Eve for a looong time supported many different sized playstyles perfectly well. While you or I may be in for it for the large scale sov warfare not everybody wants to be able to make dinner during the fight.
---
Empire Ganking, Faction Warfare, Low-Sec skirmishing, Null griefing, WHs, none of these expect to stress the servers. Some of them can be very entertaining and require huge amounts of skill as well as knowledge. Others are closer to leaning back in an armchair and flicking through channels on the TV.
---
If you want to pigeon hole Eve to a single style you kill a lot of its appeal as well as limit your horizons.
---
Right. You're telling me that on a Keepstar grid, you're unable to make sufficient bookmarks to have at least one potential spot to jump a cap fleet in?
---
I just want to say, the accuracy of the net titan guns are nuts. 150 KM out at around 6-9KM/s. 
---

Lol, he is still not input broadcasting.
---
He just uses asic miners these days.
---
Remove or rebalance capitals. They're broken as fuck.  
---
Remove or rebalance null. The safest space in the game shouldn't have the most lucrative anything. That's what the babies that "play" there say about people in hisec, but you're more likely to get suicide ganked in hisec than you are in null. In null you'll just get n+1'd, caps dropped on you and your 3 friends in subcaps, countless amounts of bubbles everywhere, etc etc etc. There comes a point where the game isn't fun or fair, 100% blue donut or not, if you're not norf or souf, you're a renter baby and most of those people I've seen just rat and try to avoid pvp.  
---
Hell, even wormholes aren't safe any more. The past 5 actual "fights" I've seen/been in in jspace have all been +1 blob bullshit.
---
&gt;TFW that titan sat docked in the largest titan fight ever
---
It’s sad my warp bubbles are the only thing interrupting the death.
---
Caps have been a problem for far longer than the usual balance cycle. The nullbabies won, ccp only listens to them.
---
Uncle Rico? 
---
Plot twist, it was somebody else’s time to shine this time hahahah
---
Follow your mouse icon with your finger to find it instantly anytime. Problem solved.
---
Only Mar5hy is capable of the inhuman 8 keystrokes per second input speed.
---
Widotting is a response to totally afk leadership, which is why widot got widotted and li3 and gents got folded into the Bastion but SMA stuck around forever.
---
There are plenty of corps out there that cater to casual play times. I'll send you a DM with our corp info if it interests you.
---
This microtransaxtion, botting and mining bullshit to die a fire. 
---
People may reform, but I can't wait for battleships to become new meta until T2s can be researched. 
---
while i could do 8 strokes a second tbh
---
1000km range, same destructibility, and 350km anchoring range from each other and a citadel.
---
Boom, you've made it possible to give them survivability against the target being dropped because they can be anchored at range, made them not particularly useful for keepstar defense because they're easily killed by subcaps and stuff out of Keepstar (and the titans on said keepstar) range, and allowed for counterplay by rorqs and others because they have the same anchoring delay + instant cyno interaction where you get at least 1 cyno cycle before the inhib shuts it off.
---
I could teach you to stroke
---
can we eject this guy
---
How am I supposed to make fun of people then?
---
It this case, it is for the rescue fleet to quickly arrive on grid.
---
Ships with jump drives (capitals, jump freighters, black ops) can 'jump' directly to a cyno that is within their jump range.
---
Cyno field generators can either be on a ship, which prevents the ship from moving for 10 minutes after activation (some ships have a role bonus to reduce this time to 5 minutes), or anchored in space.
---
faxes were rebalanced
---
it's not on the roadmap because it's done 
---
Walk around in a station and a meaningful reason to do.
---
Just remove every cap in the game, increase production time by a factor of ten and multiply material input by 50. Easy. Fixed.
---
For $15 a month I can buy a new game every month. So...
---
Machariel for fountain? Why? NC and LSH will drop dreads, and fcore just uses gnosis and Loki's. Not sure how a mach counters them
---
Capital remote repair removed entirely to bring back the dread and make fielding capitals have any risk, and some kind of community reversion to be less of a little farmville mining jerkoff session
---
Are you dumb? Cuz I think you might be dumb.
---
1. Remove Rorqs/Excavators 
---
2. Kill of half if not 3/4s of all super capitals/Titans
---
3. Make Citadels not TZ tanked
---
4. Bring back small gang PvP content
---
5. Honestly... a hard reset, remove injectors, remove Rorqs remove Excavators. Make people actually fear to lose something instead of dropping 15 supers to save a Rorq.
---
6. I don't think you'll get anyone to come back... CCP is essentially on maintenance mode, siphoning your RL money until the game dies.
---
7. Bring back AT
---
8. EvE 2.0, with the same removed as #5
---
Anyways... back to winning EvE
---
Protip: Stay out of impass. Go to GE- if you want good fights.
---
Oh man, keepstars, where does anyone begin with those.  
---
Production cost too low - only real limiting factor is PI since rorquals are broken. That's a start.  
---
Unassailable by subcaps. Plop one in jspace or hisec and it will NEVER pop - look at what happened to perimeter. That "trading tower" is a fucking tombstone on the grave that is this game.  
---
In this thread: manipulative enemies of the Imperium do their best to single out Bastion and jeer them into abandoning their coalition.
---
The skill points only apply in the test environment, so rest assured you are at least not missing out on anything in the live game.
---
Since when?
---
Last I heard was the October balance pass got pulled. I've not seen anything since then? Happy to be proven wrong but I didn't think they had been?
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pf7gpi/october-balance-pass
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **3rd Cakeday** Hugzzzzz! ^(hug)
---
That structure (an athanor) is worth as much as maybe 2 of the drekevacs in their fleet, maybe 3 if it's rigged up.
---
Home field advantage is the ability to drop caps if the rorq lights cyno before the inhib anchors and the ability to drop caps/bridge in subcaps in system with ease and warp them to the rorqual grid as necessary if for some reason the Rorqual is too AFK or too dumb to light cyno. Properly fit the structure on grid also offers a big EWAR advantage in terms of paints, neuts, and tackle as well.
---
The irony of this is epic
---
Make it so only raitaru, athanor and astrahus can be anchored in lowsec and remove all caps other than freighter and JF from lowsec.
---
Narrative is a strong drug
---
Yeah, except I'm a corp director and I can literally see how much money people make.
---
Don’t forget about lowsecbabies like snuff
---
no more tidi. honestly it all boils down to that. 
---
okay
---
Yeah because groups that had capital supremacy also could dock anywhere they wanted which gave them huge edge. There was no reason to be in FW if you wanted to do capital stuff. It drove off both those who wanted it and those who didnt want it.
---
The thing is, some of these people keep undercutting not just once or twice. So in the end everyone looses.
---
100 bombers will eventually kill it, yes, but he may have been referring to the 7 minutes of invulnerability on top of their already massive tank that give the defenders ample time to form up a response
---
Totally agree. 
---
Capitals are nuts in general in this game. 
---
Nerf fighter application.
---
Delete rorqs.
---
Delete bosons.
---
Delete HAWs
---
Instant fix to nullsec.
---
The PVP opportunity is there as long as you first can pass the requirements of completing the PVE area. The ship required to complete the PVE area typically requires an unnecessary level of ship / fitting vs the PVP area, thus meaning people who attempt it would need a typically pimped ship.
---
Get rid of PVE and let people fight it out in buffer tanked T1 cruisers. 
---
Ah, well that's reassuring 😁
---
He went to Adversity/Snuffed Out
---
Where is the gameplay in that?
---
Man, if injectors were a way to "catch up" instead of to "get ahead" I'd not have a problem. Got a five year old account? You can inject up to 5 years worth of SP. Made an alt you want to use as a rorq bot? Start waiting.
---
Exactly.  Large scale fights do take an incredible amount of skill and effort to pull off correctly, no lie.  But in terms of the actual experience for 90% of the members of those fleets, it's sit on a titan/login screen/keepstar for x minutes or hours, jumping in, and then following broadcasts.  You could train a monkey to do it.
---
Big props to people with the patience and desire to herd a couple hundred monkeys with a few monkey alts each until you've got a thousand man fleet.  But let's be honest with ourselves, it's not the monkeys that have any agency in what's going on.
---
That's exactly why you're starting to see a "shift in attitudes" in a mature game like Eve.  Most people still playing have been playing for a pretty long time.  The monkey role gets old after a while.  You start wanting gameplay where your on-the-field decisions matter.
---
Now how do you get that?  One way is to go smaller scale, where every member of the fleet is effectively a specialist role.  Another would be to dramatically change how large engagements currently work, but I don't see that happening any time soon.
---
Naturally, as more of the playerbase wants to go smaller scale, they want ways for that smaller scale gameplay to not get shut down by the blob ,and they're going to lobby for those changes.
---
I mean.. Adversity seems rather fitting.
---
Ya, and this killed the game by making all the actually interesting people leave. Have fun watching your wallets go up spergs
---
I would actually like that.
---
It still does Basil, but it's important to recognise that, by their nature, big fights have the most meaningful outcomes. If the thrill of the fight is what drives you then it shouldn't matter whether you're flying a frigate in a tiny gang, or a battleship amongst two hundred others. If depriving your foe of his space is what drives you, as it does me, it absolutely does matter.
---
Reshipping from losses immediately sounds fun! You can shoot them again!
---
~2012/2013 mechanics but with slight adjustments to ihubs and jump fatigue.
---
Remove citadels from lowsec and give lowsec passive moon mining back. Some of the most fun fights I've ever been in were medium scale moon brawls. We knew we could time the fight for a weekend and always have fun rather than this timezone tank bullshit and having to hit something 3 times. Eve 2019 is being able to roam 40 jumps through lowsec in a Marauder and if you're LUCKY, you get dropped by snuff. Just delete all non FW lowsec tbh.
---
Gothca, on assault frigs is a bit much, but what goes around comes around I guess. We all have been there, got two carriers dropped on a t1 omen by CO2 before they fell apart. 
---
You should have heard all the shit Brax, Lauren and Mav said about you when you took a vacation with skillu.   
---
HK just needs to die at this point. 
---
A whole new staff at CCP.
---
Why are you entitled to never be overpowered?
---
Start cutting back the availability of high end manufacturing materials. Make the belts spawn rate slower. Add Ellie rats to high value asteroid belts, especially in their own territory.  Reduce the availability of t3 materials, cut the drop rate for high value bpc's.
---
Fix fw.
---
Fix standings, no one with a -10 ss should be free to camp out in hs without seeing and empire response fleet chasing them down. Docking rights should be refused also.  Yeah, I know, high sec is too safe as it is, but it's BORING. 
---
Allow corps and allegiances to make sneak attacks on each other, bypassing citadel timers. Balance this by removing the timers on the attackers citadels.
---
Just some ideas, not necessarily good ones...
---
PvE that’s actually fun. When I stopped playing, it was because I don’t have enough time to sit there for hours hoping to find someone I can kill(and not get obliterated). Therefore, most of what I did was PvE, since 90% of the time I tried to PvP, it was a waste of time
---
Yeah, this is the constant cycle of alliances like The Bastion.
---
They are small, but associated with a large power so isolated from any real risk.  They become convinced they can do things on their own, and go off to try.  They inevitably get smacked down by someone bigger when their large power refuses to form to protect all their stuff.
---
Then they either go back under the umbrella, or blame the large power for not helping their allies.
---
I am not super surprised Bastion is doing this.  Competition for ratting and mining in Delve systems is pretty intense and based on the numbers they seem to form in fleets, I doubt they do much more then that.  I also think it is going to be an interesting couple of weeks, and we will see how well they do off on their own.
---
Every rorqual I've ever killed has been a slog.
---
&gt; You can kill a Titan with 100 bombers but you can't kill a Rorqual with a brain with 100 bombers.
---
Wouldn't a Titan pilot with brains have a fuckton of support on standby? :P
---
That is a bullshit straw man and you know it
---
Downvoted by nullbabies, RIP.
---
So what?
---
Just another whine about not being able to kill Goon Rorqs.  The real reason you can't kill Goons Rorqs is nothing to do with inhibs.  It's to do with Goon organisation.  It's too good for thee.  
---
You will always get the low-hanging fruit.  You don't need inhibs for idiots who aren't on coms.
---
Yes, because roaming through null and finding nothing but docked-up shitters and capitals waiting to bubblefuck you between gates is "waiting for other people to create content".
---
Remove P.A.N.I.C. and change industrial core to 1 minute cycle with 20% fuel reduction.
---
Yes
---
Just add a 1 minute agression timer against NPC just like any hostile actions taken against any other capsuleer. Would at least solve a big chunk of this bullshit VNI spam. that's been going on.
---
I implore you to do something other than VNI rat in hisec, there's so much to see and do out there!
---
Also looks like your skill queue is empty.
---
&gt;  give 'em a Bastion so they ~~don't~~ get Alpha'd immediately.
---
FTFY.
---
One of the problems for marauders is that if caps show up, they might as well self-destruct. They can *barely* tank one carrier, let alone a dread or a super.
---
No u
---
Admittedly, I've never been a fan of the concept of alts, so there is some bias there. But with that out of the way:
---
They are all tied in together. Firstly, there should have been no expectation of "only use one alpha account at a time", it is not technically possible to implement this. Secondly, the use of alts/alphas means that balancing content meant to encourage teamwork is absurdly difficult as CCP had to ensure it's not easy to multibox. Finally, the ability to immediately inject along with the ability to immediately create alts means that every little flaw in balancing is taken advantage of immediately and on a large scale. (There's also the fact that skill farms may be completely screwing with PLEX prices but I don't give a shit about thst because I didn't use PLEX) 
---
&gt; I will make sure to agree with you and disregard the facts and commentary. 
---
But only those facts that don't support your position, right? Cause you're clearly totally comfortable taking comments completely out of context to make them seem to mean _the exact opposite of what they meant._ Jesus christ you're a smooth brained idiot - you're getting huffy and defensive because you got called out for completely misrepresenting Rise's comments. Spare me the indignation, I don't really give a fuck, dude.
---
but the damage could be controlled by some actions. imagine rorquals would be completely removed ( not gonna happen but just think of it )
---
people would be angry, tears would flow as usual but except the whiny retards, most people would probably just multibox mining barges. ore prices go up cz market influencers buy the cheap ore, expecting it to get expensive and bringing the price up. money for ccp keeps flowing, you can still make money mining since ore price rises but massive material output gets reduced.
---
rise material cost for normal caps, especially fax. make them something you dont just throw around to save every retard. reduce their heal, they are way too powerful. you should buff dreads or at least make them cheaper so dreadbombs get more efficient. 
---
Oh no, the poor newbie and his 40 closest friends can't make a ship go faster than 4km/s, wait they can. Oh fuck oh shit he's clicking approach, he isn't getting any transversal oh god he can't hear us, he has airpods in
---
Not like this mentality is new. We've felt this way since at least 2010. Probably longer, but I can only personally attest to that period of time.
---
you're the kid who raised his hand in class to remind the teacher about the quiz you're supposed to have, aren't you
---
Bastion is always the worst guys to end up trying to rat / mine in a system with.  They get super pissy about you not joining channels and shit.
---
I honestly hope that ALL of them move up there, and are no longer allowed to rat / mine in Delve.  It will make things a lot easier for the rest of us.
---
I kind of assume in a month when they have lost a dozen or so ratting supers we will probably see them come back down though :(
---
But the donut
---
Ccp need to make this harsh unforgiving universe ( that is very forgiving now ) much harsher I would suggest
---
Ship loss empties your wallet to those who killed you and pod loss removes all skills that player trained 
---
What? Your response doesn’t hold any relevance.
---
Classic example of a tiny group that thinks it is more powerful then it is.
---
Bastion hasn't figured out that their ranks are full of nullbears yet, so they think that they are going to go up to fountain and do great.  In reality, they are probably going to get stomped and have to cry for papa goon to come and save them.
---
I like this idea. maybe 3 different sized inhibitors that require a bigger ship for each one. so like 100km, 500km, 1000km (battleship needed or hauler)

&gt;This shithead takes the thread and derails it with stupid fucking whine like this
---
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Viktor. The manbun is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of his corp destruction prowice goes over a typical viewer's head. There's also Steel's expert leadership, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Karl Marx's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these qualities, to realise that they're not just real- they say something deep about WERMHOLES. As a consequence people who dislike Viktor truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Shekel's  suggestion to "join TDSIN," which itself is a cryptic reference to Brisc Rubal's epic 'Uniting Wormhole Space.' I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Viktors's genius wit unfolds itself across C6 space. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
---
that is well true, the difference is people are bad mouthing bastion using fact. (yes and some BS) all because they are unable to chat to alliance leadership, in fear of getting shot down or just being told you are not a team player, (witch translates to leave the bastion while you can) lost a few friends because of this all because they wanted to voice their concerns, or make a suggestion only to be met with an alliance leader, in a bad mood for whatever reason and ended up leaving. I stay for the lazy layed back attitude of leadership who don't care if you Krab and don't pap, bastion is breaking down from the inside not by the spies but more by members, who have given up and no longer care about the alliance instead stay for the isk making and will leave once its done.
---
It means you can have more engaging gameplay with all the titan spam as op described above
---
I think reading your posting is enough needed.
---
u do group discounts? 
---
They say they aren't taking supers, but do you really expect some nullbears not to start super ratting as soon as there is a functional umbrella up?
---
I can't wait for the inevitable "Why are you ratting in supers!?!?" leak to come out after a few die.
---
I spent a bit of time in Fountain - do not go anywhere near the Phoenix constellation, GaNg BaNg TeAm and We Want Your Isk will kill you, forever.
---
Time I barely had time for EVE when I left and feel even more so now.
---
Bastion module being given cyno inhib is a stupid idea, good luck bringing a fucking marauder thru WHs or enemy space, also can’t receive remote reps like the current cyno inhib making it even weaker???
---
Remember when PANIC didn't need a roid and you cold use it to tackle enemy fleets?
---
It's less a "We can do it!" and more of a "We should do it" Sitting in Delve all day under supercap umbrella makes for weak pvp and I think people know this. Some would prefer to stay there, others would prefer to try something new.
---
Drove up PLEX price like crazy. Win win for CCP
---
No doubt but not my problem :P
---
Use the referral code “5CAPS” to skip two recruitment questions of you choice and shorten trial by a week.
---
He means it would be super safe.  Light your cyno, anchor inhib, undroppable cap staging.
---
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not.
---
good fites were had
---
fortizar jams are op :( would've caught atleast 2-3 more caps extracting 
---
So I'm pretty sure I'm done with Eve for good, but I've been reflecting on this to some extent. I agree that injectors fundamentally ruined TQ, probably beyond all hope of repair. 
---
What I think would be super interesting is to essentially abandon TQ as a lost cause for game balance, and then create a new single-shard server that would merge into Legacy TQ once every 3-12 months (and then reset to a clean slate for major expansions).  Anything goes on the "seasonal league" server - skill farming, rorquals, injecting to your heart's content, whatever.  The economic meta would be really interesting. For the first few weeks of a league, people would actually fly t1 bullshit, and it would actually make a ton of sense to do so. Capitals probably couldn't exist for at least a month or two even with injectors, and proliferation would take many months. They'd be rare enough early on that killing capitals would be a meaningful setback in a young economy. So much shit that's obsolete in the game due to ridiculous wealth inflation would be relevant again.
---
Then make Legacy TQ totally F2P. Everyone is always Omega, but disable injectors and make leagues the mechanism to quickly roll new toons. Stop worrying about trying to balance TQ because frankly it's a lost cause. Focus on the seasonal league server.
---
At no vacancies we have what are called standards. Every new recruit must submit a brain scan to show at least 3 folds. If the recruit fails to provide one or doesn’t have one taken we divert the applicant to TDSN or Pospy
---
mfw you think I'm remotely surprised that my impulsive, immature ass got shit talked behind my back. HK won't die so long as our members don't let it. And if you were around to see the results of that poll then you'd know we'll be fine.
---
its because CCP made it so the only ship that matters is cap ships and supercaps. this game was way better when the average line memeber flew battleships.
---
It absolutely cannot. We (SNUFF) have had this happen before and the athanor will take away most of the armour, but leave you enough to repair it. 
---
\&gt; TDSN and Pospy are now the number 1 and 2 Corp in wh space. 
---
POSPY can't do shit without their overlords saying so first. Plus, a bunch of retarded chipmunks could fight them on level pegging and win. So... 
---
Jokes on you my brain is so smooth it technically has an infinite ammount of folds
---
Looks like a decent medium scale fight. Still a shit region.
---
there's quite a chasm between "home field advantage means nothing" and thinking having literally no way to keep the grid clear of cynos in gun range while still being in rage of all their support and 7 minutes of unironic invincibility on top of a cancerous local tank is too strong.
---
xD
---
Ratting Vexor here we go
---
Wall of text says you do give a fuck. Sorry you are so angry about your opinion not being fact or law. Cheers angry duder.
---
Or, you know, flair baited like the spastic retard that you are... 
---
CCP hates making exception to rules.
---
It makes the code messy, and prone to bugs.
---
Free time, Eve takes a lot of it. 
---
Actual ship iteration. Stuff left untouched for years in a state where it’s clear no one uses them on a large scale.
---
Unfortunately the damage done by Rorq mining and injectors is likely irrevocable, and it just makes the game a lot less interesting to me. 
---
An iteration on TIDI so large scale fights don’t drain my soul. I feel like I remember that when this was implemented it was supposed to be a temporary fix till they could improve things. Not the standard. I could be wrong.
---
&lt;Insert rehashed blurb about citadels, delve, pearl abyss, csm and ccp’s lack of communication here&gt;
---
I’ve played the game since 2008 and I’ve never been more bored or jaded as I have been the last 2-3 months. 
---
supers can launch fighters from 200km just fine
---
Sorry youre just too dumb to understsnd the true genius in living in a 3 4/5 pulsar. 
---
Mother fucking pvp. It's all but gone in the game for small to medium groups.  There is a million ways to do it, by that is what needs to happen. Game is just too safe anymore
---
Couldn't agree with you more. I've raised the inhib problem with multiple CSM members but most of them seem oblivious/care more about their members mining in rorqs. Also this knucklehead clearly has never tried to run a drek fleet, because there is virtually no way in which you stay on grid when supers/titans start to load. Also, we've found inhibs are all but worthless save for the stupidest of people. Most people will light a cyno as soon as they get tackled and, even if you do somehow get the inhib up in time, they just warp in a fleet intie and light cyno at 100, while giving 0 shits about bubbles.
---
The purpose of putting Rorquals on the field was to generate conflict, not easy capital kills.
---
no no, they teach how to identify a stroke
---
Void bombs...
---
Yeah it eases the load
---
If the fights sucked so bad, why do 5000 people show up to them?
---
i remember this suggestion and it sounded awesome. marauders would become like super heavy interdictors and would actually be worth the cost.
---
No more real talk only goodposting 
---
IMO you are conflating the two. The inhibitor is actually fairly garbage. But you're right that PANIC is obscenely OP.
---
&gt;If depriving your foe of his space is what drives you
---
But for many it isn't what drives them. It's the fight itself, the contribution they had to it and how much of a role they played.
---
&gt;  flying a frigate in a tiny gang 
---
Requires you to actually fly your ship, be active, aware and awake. 
---
This is interesting for many.
---
&gt; a battleship amongst two hundred others. 
---
Requires F1 and broadcast for shield or armor after you have anchored. Maybe a ammo swap or align command if you're lucky. 
---
This is dull for many.
---
Until the 5 minutes are up and you get 0.01 isked, at which point you have to put in effort and lower you price to be selling again
---
That's only if it's the fight that gives you the thrill. But if its matching your skill against anothers, then big fleets are meaningless. At that point it is either, who can get more people, or which FC choose the right ships and fits to ask for. Not, who's pilots have the most skill. Personally I love eve because I and my friends get to match put skills and judgment to others. And the rawest form of this is on a 1v1 lvl. But is also very evadent at a small gang lvl. I also think that meaningful battles with meaningful out comes have and still do, come from small gang PVP. 
---
Damn, welcome to No Brains pick up your nag on the left and enjoy contint
---
they should have 3 different sized jammers that require different sized ships. So 100km, 500km and 1000km, with the 1000km requiring a battleship or hauler sized ship to drop it off. cover ops might be good role for this...
---
They should change the time until it self destructs from 1 hour to 30 mins to reduce trolling. 1 hour is excessive and if your battle goes over an hour, you gotta drop another cyno inhibitor. or refuel the inhibitor. 
---
also the inhibitor should only stay active while a "friendly" or fleet ship is within its range, not cloaked. if all friendly/fleet ships leave the inhibitor area then the device instantly self destructs. 
---
so this should fix all issues and anyone that has a inhibitor up has to have a ship on grid in the inhibitor range. this way you cant just deploy endless inhibitors that takes hours to clear and kill them all because you'd only need to kill the ships keeping the inhibitor active by their proximity. or kill the inhibitor directly unless they have logi ships healing it. 
---
It always makes me cringe when a Goon is bitching about someone supposedly input broadcasting. 
---
It isn't, fuck off and leave already.
---
More irl time. Cause eve is really time consuming.
---
And a hard isk sink when you gotta play. Because people wealth is getting so ridiculous that they somehow tell you to inject jdc 5.
---
It's about all you can do in Eve. Aggressors are so unilaterally petrified of having their killboards reflect fiscal losses that they choose the cheapest possible setups that work for very narrowly-defined tasks.
---
It'll be a wonderland for both of them!
---
This is how you get around the station if you choose "leave ship".
---
Buff all subcaps so that they are much closer to the DPS/Tank/Rep power of capitals.
---
&gt; Yes, they would have have to drop caps off grid and warp them within range of the inhib to kill it.
---
... or deploy fighters from 2000km
---
Did you just take my joke and make it better? I think you did. I have brought shame amongst my famawee...
---
You’ve been officially denied entry into No Brains. Enjoy your stay in Reload This.
---
Ive spent a decade on and off in new eden, never touched a cap, I like speed. Best thing I can think of is remove jump fatigue. 
---
Sounds counter intuitive, but we need the "boogie men" back. We meed lone and small cap holding groups to have their caps hunted again. Population control is important.
---
And nothing of value was lost.

Skill queue is empty because of alpha clone and don't worry I'm going to low/nul
---
If dreads weren't dogshit vs titans, this would actually be true; we could welp 1000 dreads a week in border wars and rorq dunks. Maybe more with the amount we mine. 
---
problem is there's 0 reason to commit anything smaller than titans. Bringing a dread to a titan fight is worse than SDing it on your undock, since you'll feed the loot to the enemy as well.

That my children grow up and I divorce from my wife.
---
Many great ideas here. I will share my unsolicited thoughts:
---
1. 0.005% LP of the total isk value killed. Example: Kill a enemy 10 mil frig, get 500lp.... Kill an 1 bil enemy Mach get 50000 (split among fleet). This helps the actually PVP'ers make some money back on their losses but not enough LP so it will sting when we get dunked. 
---
2. FW Missions die. They provide zero content for the intended purposes of FW (PVP).
---
3. Only structures owned by the controlling faction can be in High Power.... neuts and enemy factions will be in low power. This forces the faction that lost the system to come together and fight for it or be easily cleaned up by the controlling faction. When clones, asset safety, staging, etc come into play it will provide value to owning the systems. Currently there is no real gain to own a system. 
---
4. This will be highly controversial, but cyno jam FW space.  You can gate it (which would provide more chances for content) but it will stop third parties from cap blobbing (cough cough snuff) and provide some relief from cap proliferation. 
---
5. Plex LP gets cut in half across the board. Why can I used a 2mil SP character in a venture and make 1bil isk in a day? I have done it so do not think I am innocent, but I'd gladly give it up to get a healthy FW again. 
---
6. I am getting lengthy but CAL/GAL FW space should be cut down in size. It sucks to roam 30 systems to kill an afk venture. This will provide more non-fw spaces for null blocs to cyno and still be able to move through as well. 
---
I love FW it gave me my start and kept me playing eve over the years. I would have walked away from the game after a few months if it wasn't for FW. Many others had the same experience, we are losing players that do not want to krab in null all day just to have NYXs dropped on their faces when they finally do pvp. It provides an ISK Sink to stop this mass market inflation as well. Rant over.... Make Faction Warfare Great Again!
---
I don't know what would happen to my life if they properly made Eve 2.
---
Remove pay2win features, hire a balancing team back and reset the server. 
---
Say what you mean.
---
When is the book coming out?
---
Did you start eve post 2012, because you might be the dumb one.
---
Remove panic. Remove the stationary portion of industrial core and give rorqual 60 second align time (at max boost with 4 inertials).
---
If Reload This. Isn't your speed I'm making a new corp called Reload That. In a c4 c1/c3
---
INIT is also a pretty large and formidable alliance on their own.
---
Bastion is full of fat... which I think is what carneros is trying to burn off with this.  The problem is, they are a small group filled with fat.  Goons are loaded with fat, but they are so large that it doesn't really matter to them.
---
I think the big difference here also is that fountain is notorious for getting dropped on.  Put that with a notification to everyone that they are moving there, and I feel like it is going to be open season.  
---
To be fair there is aids on both ends of the spectrum.  5km/s frigates trolling noobs all day is not fun either.
---
Erm? Is this supposed to be an unfunny joke?
---
Don't worry, some country singer will write a sorrowful tale of how those rorquals lived and will be loved by their families and for the sacrifice they made for their country. 
---
No actually Bastion was formed because Goonswarm wasn't taking in corps. At the time, way back in the year 2014, Goons thought they had a bit of identity issue in that their culture was toxic or something. So they actually didn't accept new corps for quite a while. And during this time, a lot of old Northern and CFC alliances were having issues (particularly with poaching corps) so corps that didn't want to stay in their alliance could join Bastion. That changed due to Fozziesov and other issues (Like the creation of KarmaFleet) and 2015 saw the beginning of corps starting to join Goons again.  
---
During this time, Goons were desperate to have as many bodies as possible to fight off NC/PL as they did not have supercap supremacy yet.
---
Starting with the CEO.
---
If supers are such an issue why don't you just use your own?
---
Hahaha you finally caught on to our plan. Once PosSin takes over c5 space you will be forced to mine all of the spod you can carry while listening to different anime openings over and over again. Heh, you should have seen it coming kids when we sent the furries over to infiltrate your ranks and spread their disease among your ranks. Hope you like Naruto because you'll all be getting headbands in the mail

They removed the cap bonuses, and reduced the local and remote repair amounts. Although I think they had a second nerf planned as a follow up which they cancelled or they pulled the punch on the first nerf.

What was your point?  A Domi and Carrier can kill your little special snowflake frigate in the same time, fuck off and actually articulate your whine.
---
Except the buyers

Because they enjoy being able to mine/rat in peace.

More space like x2-x5 more nullsec would even shoot for x50 , less to no wormholes.

find some way of making isk that sucks the least

this way you can keep whelping frigs without hating yourself 
---
Pretty simple:  the ability to do missions (or whatever quests are called) together.   The fact that the game is designed so there is no benefit to grouping up with friends was a huge turnoff for me and my crew.

Thanks for making my point, as usual. 
---
I'll bring up both. :)
---
They do have more than 100k ehp lmao. More like 120-130. Thats not really relevant when the average response is several titans and supers, or a 80 man Muninn fleet
---
This is why weebs are a mistake
---
I was simply offering to be a conduit. I passed on a lot of stuff folks asked me to. Still do. I'm not trying to claim I'm an expert or know their issues - I count on them to do that, and I present what they give me. 
---
ITT: Triggered gons
---
Sure. 
---
are you seriously bitching that someone uses bombers to cloaky camp
---
"bombers are like 40mil, they must be terrified of kb stats" 
---
Except the group OP is in, does have supers, more than most small nullsec alliances. Thats completely irrelevant to the issue
---
I mean, supers, dreads and titans couldn't hit shit, and carriers couldn't web/point/deal 1500-3000 dps from 1000km away
---
&gt; Fun, dynamic gameplay should be the gateway drug into being an F1 monkey in a tidifest
---
👌
---
Pandemic Legion got shit on so fucking hard by the patches it's unreal. 
---
This game used to be so much more fun with capitals it's unreal. CCP finally fixes nullsec by creating rorqs which means local minerals for nullsec entities (A GOOD CHANGE), and then proceed to utterly destroy the ability of third party entities to use their capitals in a fun way. Instead we got this fucking trashtastic capitals taking gates and local capital umbrellas, because nobody can move their capital fleets anymore without several hours of spare time where any idiot can clearly tell you're moving. PANIC is clearly OP though. 
---
I also want to camp people into their stations again. I fucking hate tether mechanics. PDS is the most broken OP trash idea ever. I should be able to force people to fight me by sitting on their undock.
---
I want to force people to fight me and not over these fucking hot garbage 1 week timers on citadels with fucking useless damage caps that we have nowadays. I don't want to spend years grinding dumb fucking damage caps and holy shit the sov mechanics? Are you fucking kidding me? It takes MONTHS before you can even lower the ADM values of a region before you can actually start to sov wand it.
---
I'm actually fine with injectors though. Having a bunch of dumb idiots flying capitals that they clearly have no fucking clue what they're doing in isn't a problem IMO. 
---
Honestly, I don't even know why I play this game anymore, but it's certainly not for the dumb shit broken fuckery mechanics that CCP idiotically put into the game. I feel like OP post may have trolled me but w/e fuck it.
---
is that what OP was using?
---
Thank you for your reply, i do agree that "gross negligence" might be strong for something like this, but id hope the level of frustration would be understood from players like myself who have been unable to access the mass tests for the game we love for over a year, who knows how long others have had this issue.
---
* mass test for 64bit today is on Duality, not Sisi, which may not have the same issue for you.
---
Ive just now tried logging into Duality at 18:20 EVE Time, Launcher in beta mode, etc. I was given the same "Verification Code Mismatch" error that i was given on SiSi.
---
We also advocated for Rorq nerfs, which happened, more attention to botting, which happened, too much cap proliferation, which is something that's being dealt with right now and we're hoping for some balance changes based on our feedback from the last summit. 
---
As Suitonia noted, if the CSM only focused on the big nullsec blocs, the war dec changes would never have happened. 
---
More than half the stuff we're asked to talk about and comment on have nothing to do with areas of space or specific gameplay styles. 
---
It's underused because you typically need 3b+ setups to compete, and when you do play it's usually super boring ram fights in fits that can tank eachother for obscene amounts of time.
---
Capri was in Adversity/TISHU well before his HK days.
---
I’ve been playing off and on for 12 years.  Done small gang, solo, and now more midsize alliance level content.  Having more fun now than ever before.  Most important thing is finding a group of players that you enjoy playing with.  Everything else tends to fall into place after that.
---
/u/ccp_falcon can you please report this to the security team. If this and the previous is not obvious input broadcasting I don't know what is. 
---
Change the entire structure of the game and its demographics to enable more content in PST hours.  Seems very difficult to find quality PVP in this timezone as people are all playing fortnite or asleep.
---
Brisc, my man, sometimes you surprise me with your level of knowledge.  Keep up the good fight.
---
always fun to fight against GBT, to be honest. You're probably one of the few dudes that will actually fight (on the occasion)
---
I think ccp's new anti botting program worked. GG CCP
---
As I noted, the response here would have happened regardless because the cyno went up before the inhib went up. The point is after that, what happens. 
---
Zelden's point is that you can bubble in the direction from the cyno, but a competent response isn't going to war directly from the cyno to grid. Regardless, whether it's 1000 km or 100 km, the point of the inhib is to keep the reinforcements off grid, which didn't happen here, so as I noted, the range wouldn't have mattered. 
---
the game hosts battles of thousands of players.... not
---
Ive looked for the email before, none have ever arrived. A year ago, yesterday, and now this morning. The Duality server gives the same Mismatch error.
---
A) That's exactly what I'm implying
---
B) I've never botted
---
In all honesty, I hope they all get forced to go.  I am not a fan of half measures.  Take all your toys and strike it out on your own, more space for the rest of us.
---
I do not expect this to happen, because a lot of the bloat in their alliance would suddenly be applying to LAWN or Goons to stay in delve.
---
Money. I'm poor...

&gt;We won't cap blob you in GE-

https://zkillboard.com/related/30001156/201809112200/
---
I would think we need less giant supercorps and more of a benefit to smaller and spread out corps. So much of Eve is just... Empty... Why not incentivise occupation of less commonly tread systems? Maybe rotating resources or something like that? Could you imagine what would happen if Goons could actually mine itself dry and be forced to roam out for income?
---
I went to FW because I haven’t really PVPd in my time in the game but it’s my last attempt to continue playing. It all just seems like an isk grind anymore. Gaining more number pixels isn’t fun.
---
I would return if my friends started playing again.
---
His 14th JF loss.  At what point do you realize its not your calling in life?
---
Appreciated, thanks.
---
yea ok botter
---
As soon as they lose their first fight without goons, they will crawl back. They simply lack the fortitude to survive on their own.
---
Sometimes I think we should bring back gun-mining so that all this fucking rorqual whine can fuck off and be replaced with 'why does no one mine anymore'.
---
there is very recent guide online about current FW meta with fits and in-depth explanation. you then forget about all the fits and fly off-meta since that's the only shit that works consistently
---
can't find the guide right now, maybe someone else can chime in

Fair Winds and Following Seas, CCP Guard.  You have been the public face for our community for so long and though it saddens us all that you are moving on, it's wonderful that you going out to try new things.  I feel it's a healthy thing and I wish you be best in your endeavors.     
---
Viva La Guardia!  
---
Dude, you literally think goons cover fountain with the supercap umbrella. Newsflash: they don't. Also you feeling insulted that someone who is not a member of your alliance or your SIG, who also never had any interest in joining or learning about SIGs, even further compounds the level of your stupidity and arrogance. I mistook the name of the SIG for a specific alliance(suddenly spaceships). Not sure why them, but I did. You could have said "sorry, but are you sure you're thinking of the right group?", but instead chose to attack me.
---
Faster paced gameplay..zzz
---
The game is slow, and 2 hour ops to defend or attack a strategic objective that half the time isnt defended and another quarter of the time is not meaningfully defended and is only defended by trolls doing slowing tactics to make your experience as boring as possible.  Like bubbling every gate and or making timers with 1 guy that 50 defend for a no show. 
---
Did you check in the TQ account management that it's the correct e-mail address you're checking? You could've created that account using an old address that you no longer use and it's sending the token there. There's nothing you can do to fix that for the test now, but wait for the next one and you should be good to go if you change the address.

Nice essay
---
Eve is a game of Min/Maxing. The mechanics are complicated and someone will always find a niche to exploit to their benefit. 
---
It just happens the capital meta is extra boring compared to older metas. 
---
Yes yachtfleet was a massive succes
---
Well my good sir, an Athanor has the following radii:  
---
Radius: 45km  
---
Tether: 10km  
---
This gives you a strange shaped area of some 20km ish in the middle of the mesh of the citadel, right where you would not want to cyno in some fat ass titans to bounce around.
---
You should stop posting bro you sound like an absolute noob. 
---
or just go to wormholes and get everything interesting and fun you talked about without 1000 capitals dropped by bored neighbors 
---
What do you consider meaningful PVP? 
---
&gt;However, perhaps consider it may not be the game design that is boring? But the way you are playing it?
---
they are playing it how they are, BECAUSE of the current game design.
---
Only if TSK moves in with GBT.
---
My PC withstood a lot of Paradox strategy games, I'm pretty sure it would be fine
---
the joke
---
Do something to destabilise large groups of players.
---
I don't know, I haven't played Eve in fucking ages so I don't know if anything or what has been done but it seems too easy still for large groups to control everything.
---
Drops offense rorq in indy mode with 500 inhibs, and loot-haulers filled with more.
---
yeah it's literally 10 manticores, not remotely interesting
---
I can't stand bb leadership, but it's also not proof of input broadcasting at all
---
If I can dream I would rework EvE to be played with only one character per player. Everyone having multiple characters is very bad for the game imo, it promotes doing everything with your own characters, people should have to work together more to accomplish things. 
---
Come up with some system which makes it impossible to play more than one character. Also remove skill injectors and plex, pay a subscription if you want to play.
---
How do you make it impossible to play more than one character? I don't know, forced retina scan at all times while playing maybe, that would solve the botting problems as well :]
---
UHHHH HOLD ON BRO LETS GO THROUGH THE CHECKLIST:
---
1. Is he rorqual mining? **No.**
---
2. Was he in a rorquals or super? **No.**
---
3. Is he in Goons? **No.**
---
He’s totally cleared of all allegations.
---
I just want local to work consistently again.
---
Nah, cpu load in big fights is not that high, client spends a lot of time skipping frames (probably waiting for server response most of the time, and i guess you can't update simulation correctly without it).
---
What's more alarming is single client breaking 9 gb of ram easily with just 500 in local. Looks like huge memory leak somewhere 
---
Email is correct, i just double checked, not even in junk mail. Used the seach bar to look for older authentication tokens and ive never received another token via email beyond the original 2FA setup process.
---
The only tokens ive ever used where from the Auth app that it has you set up. I just checked my settings as well to see if theres an "email me tokens" or anything and couldn't find one.
---
Be nice if CCP at least looked into this.
---
Wut
---
\#1 and #2 are Ivy League and Wingspan lol
---
That's a really good way to make people even more risk averse than they already are.
---
You forgot how he's an important content creator and thus should have different rules
---
As a new player, with only about two hours into the game, I can already tell I want to be a part of a corp and soon. It seems like you would have a lot more fun by participating in a group. So my question is, when should I be reaching out on places like r/Evejobs to get recruited? If it has any bearing I should mention I am really into the idea of mining/hauling
---
With 1000km range, you could just park a rorq at a bunch of pre-booked spots and drop 6 every 10 mins if needed.
---
You spawn in direct doomsday range dude. That's the main use for most umbrellas. LR guns have nothing to do with anything.
---
Moreover, you can't defang 50 supers. It's still wrong being able to defend an entire region with no counterplay just becaue you have 50 supers in a single system.
---
??? you don't get it do you? i don't want to kill the carrier OR the domi. i want to kill his engageable friends without being forced off-grid the moment i see your carrier. the domi needs 10s to lock me, then the warriors have to travel with 5k (half the speed of fighters) and don't point, web and alpha me off the grid. fighters are always faster (i can outrun warriors for longer). i can do so many things with a domi on grid that would be immediately shut down by a capital without counterplay (no i don't have a dread-bomb, i prefer to play this as a game not a second life). 
---
&gt; The only tokens ive ever used where from the Auth app that it has you set up. I just checked my settings as well to see if theres an "email me tokens" or anything and couldn't find one.
---
This is a completely separate thing and not related to 2FA. It's to verify that you own the e-mail address you provided and that verification seems to get reset on the test servers once in a while.

What's that? Frigates? Guess it's titan time
---
Well they would lose 95% of the bitter vets, pick up a ton of new players.  90% of the new players would quit within 2 months, then the game would die.  Bitter vets keep this game floating, the new kids these days have so many more game choices I do not see many keeping this as their main game for long. 
---
The end of the krabbing meta. 
---
Tracking Titans?  
---
Solopwn Motherships?  
---
omg you got me, dreads were used for dread things before  
---
Carriers could point and web you from 1/5 of the grid before.  Now they have NSA and cannot ewar.
---
The entire player base has gotten smarter. The easy prey is either gone, in high sec, or under a super umbrella. Everyone wants a situation where the odds are stacked in their favor, and those who want to avoid altercation, do. 
---
Cyno inhibs should at least prohibit people from lighting cynoes in direct intervention range, such as doomsdays or quick fighter burning. Which means inhibs at least some 500km inhibation range (and yes, more when you think of citadels). Further off cynoes have nice interactive counterplays such as defensive bubbling, so it becomes a nice matter of skill and strategy between the two sides.
---
A targeted active inhib module on BLOPS battleships is needed as well. But as OP said it's peripheral to the inhib issue.

Pretty much everyone who solos in the small gang community avoids Catch and GE- like the plague now specifically for reasons like this. When you get dropped in Impass they say go to Catch, when you get dropped in Catch or GE- they say go to FW. 
---
Well, the funny part is that you blame me for not sticking my head out of Delve, why you obviously have no idea what's happening. 
---
If you are part of the Imperium and you have never heard of Space Violence, you are the one never sticked your head out of your home system.
---
Also, I never said the super umbrella is there, it obviously is not. But there are people ratting and mining and they have some sort of Theta 2.0 running at times. Well, I hopefully don't have to explain to you what Theta is now, do I?
---
Dunno how active they still are, but it used to be enough to fend of some smaller dreadbombs. I would estimate that their size have rather grown instead of shrinked, but that is just an assumption.
---
Anyways, have fun krabbing...
---
&gt;i played for a few months several years ago... I recently came back and i am having such a hard time. I bought some plex to make it a bit easier to get back into, but it has all been drained.  
---
&gt;I spend all of my in game time just trying to earn isk, id be happy if i just broke even. i have lost 10+ vni's and have not even made the 100 mil it takes to fit one.  
---
&gt;I joined Pandemic Horde so i could get some sort of community, but i just cant survive out here.... there are bubbles at random gates everywhere i try to go... when i do make it to an empty system, i rat for 20 minutes and then lose another 100 mil isk vni to some prick who just wants to get kills on his zkillboard.  
---
&gt;I would think a corporation this big could protect its space, at least keep a few sectors safe for all the newbros they bring out here...  
---
&gt;Maybe i belong in high sec for a while... but now that im in Pandemic, i cant go to hi sec either...  
---
&gt;Im not sure what i am doing wrong, or what to do next.
---
Ok, so first off, you need to talk to some people in PH. They will give you some tips on how to survive and thrive better, give you some current and up to date specifics.
---
2nd, you can have multiple accounts. If you want to try HS then make one. Let it train up a bit. Keep your other one in PH. You can play your HS character doing whatever in HS while staying on PH comms and when a fleet you want to join forms up or something like that, simply switch. This is what a lot of us do.
---
This way you can do either / or as you choose and have both.
---
Imagine being that bored in EVE that you get excited about someone losing 10 campers and then bragging about it on reddit.

&gt; Instead, low level PvP is dominated by risk averse autists flying blinged out shit and feeling elite because their snake set...
---
This is an inevitable downward spiral, though. Takes forever to find content, so better bring some cool shit so it's meaningful. Uhoh, my billion isk cruiser is worth too much to yeet into a bad engagement profile, better dock up... If more groups would take out meta/t2 fit t1 cruisers with the goal of fun at all costs, there would be so much more action.
---
Also, we should probably delete gate guns in lowsec. They take away a lot more from the game than they add.

Just scout some Rorqs in a C1 and go kill them together in lieu of an interview and you'll be a shoo in.
---
Nah id rather get in and feed during my entire trial 
---
During planetary production, a basic industry facility takes 3000 units as input and processes it in 30 minutes. What happens with the raw materials if my input is larger than 3000 units. Do they get lost or does a new process queue up?
---
Before the big drone revamps, before the carrier changes, before rorquals and panics, a roaming gang could kill meaningful targets and prompt a sub cap fleet to undock.  
---
Now all you see are stabbed alpha VNIs and rorqs.  Spending a few hours to kill a few vni's is meaningless.  Before, killing a tengu had a meaningful impact.
---
Tackling a rorqual requires you to break at least a 7k dps tank, hold it for 7 minutes, then break it again without a cap fleet being dropped on your head.  Of which, there is no way for a nano gang to prevent said cap fleet, because the rorq lights a cyno the moment it is tackled.
---
Nano has been effectively shelved by design.
---
If there is no difference between 1000km and 100km then the concept of bubbling grid doesn't matter either because that only keeps the reinforcements at max 500km from the target. Clearly the bubbling is a relevant point to all parties so I can't see what the disconnect is at this point.

Don't worry he is capable of representing everyone with all playstyles. No conflict of interest.

You should stop posting bro you sound like an absolute noob.

I adore eve and would rather watch grass grow than be in a fleet large than 10 people. 
---
Orange juice box man stabs local wormhole pony in back and runs off after his tendies. More narrative at 8.
---
So let me get this straight, you're suggesting people might use a cyno inhib to stop people from cynoing into a fight?
---
Sounds like it's working as intended.
---
Uh the warriors can easily do 10kms you baddie.
---
You just want free kills.
---
'kill his engagable friends'  aka 'kill the easy stuff'
---
haha bro gotem lol XD
---
Ships are cheaper. So you don’t have to grind as long to pay for PVP
---
C'mon, I'm not using Straw Man, I'm using Reduction to Absurdity.  Get your logical fallacies straight!

Large scale fights are basically two FCs playing an RTS against each other and you’re an NPC.

It’s more believe able that he just forgot to cloak ten times, indeed.
---
I tried once, never again, ever.
---
i wanted to get into goons and train for a rorqual. it looked like fun. just mining in my big ship. maybe later i would train for a titan who knows. everyone wanted only pvp'ers so ofcourse i got denied. started playing ff14 now. thats my only regret.
---
This would lead to some quality content.
---
And this is related how?
---
Always been a fan of Caldari, which of their ships are currently in meta? 
---
In any modern functioning umbrella you'd get dropped 50+ titans, supers, carriers and faxes on top of your head. They'll wreck your drek fleet with or without a citadel on grid. The citadel guns or the strength of titan guns etc has pretty much nothing to do with anything. The issue is there not being a counter to stall/prevent the umbrella come to the grid in the first place. That's the inhib's job.
---
I want to be able to make more of a difference without having to use 2-3 (or more) accounts simultaneously. The prevalence of multiboxing is seriously hampering my enjoyment of the game, but how empty would EVE seem if every player was limited to playing only one account at a time? I guess it's not something that's likely to happen.
---
Never has a post left me so disgusted. 
---
Free subscription when?
---
&gt;he doesn't even know
---
:') what an embarassment
---
I wish you could post better.  Jesus, get off.
---
even with a offense rorq, you can only deploy inhib 1 at a time (the inhibs cant be in range of each other). and if you move out of range to deploy another, the other self destructs unless you have a fleet mate/friendly stay with it. Or we can make it the deploying ship must be in range, so only 1 inhibitor can exist per ship. thus kill the ship kill the inhibitor. 
---
there is also anchoring time. so if the defense fleet is able to destroy the inhibitor, there is a time gap before they can deploy a new one to replace it, this gives time to move onto grid and tackle and destroy the rorq. also the bigger inhibitors have longer activation/anchoring time.
---
and another idea is you need special ships to "deploy and activate" the inhibitors. to prevent endless inhibitors. for example covert op battleships could be the only ship capable of housing the 1000km inhibitors, and can only fit 3 in their cargo hold at a time (m3 issues). only they can deploy and activate the module, sorta like they tether to the inhibitor in a sense. you can also make them not scoopable/transferable in space and can only be loaded into the ship via a station, the ship must be docked for the inhib to be added to cargo hold. or like drone hold, you have a cyno inhibitor hold....
---
LR Titans oneshot max traversal T3Ds and HACs at 200km though so not really much you can do anyway. 
---
Have no effect on panic...
---
Welcome to 2019
---
&gt; I think they recognized that the old cyno inhibs were OP,
---
Lol nobody has ever said that ever.
---
Prepare for more than just the tip...
---
One dread is a cap blob now? We can't stop people from yoloing in their own shit. They get berated for doing so in Catch, but there isn't a compliance Titan awaiting people that do it or anything.
---
I applaud this post. Allowed us to track and have him kicked :)
---
I mean he has to tab through the clients to log in, and then again to cloak up. It's easy to imagine that he'd go for a coffee while they're all logging in and forget about not having cloaked up because habit would dictate that he had cloaked upon login. Saying this, I absolutely believe he was input broadcasting the first time around.
---
Yep, it was and still is. In fact there are in-game channels that you can pay people with good standings to do it for you. 
---
An improvement on the system or tools that help newer players fight against other similarly skilled pilots in solo/small gangs. I tried FW, WH, Large Corps. FW was pretty fun when it wasn't flaky, but really turned into a 'bigger small gang than you'. WH was decently fun but no one fights unless they are blinged out of the universe, and large corps were just .. not new player friendly. I did not love being raged at on comms because my t1 omen couldn't scram a t2 frigate 50km away. I felt totally lost on what to do about 2 months in.
---
All 48000 damage through your Loki's hitpoints?
---
my bad, thought you were a Goons pet.
---
if Eve is a thinking game why are these big fights just pushing f1 on broadcasts after they right click keep at range their anchor
---
oh, you mean it's a thinking game when it's smaller and pilot skill matters? the part of the game that isn't aids? we all agree with that 
---
not really no, the mentality is wanting frags. No one wants a fair fight, even if those are often most fun in the end.
---
It's not how people play that's boring. They pay for this game, you don't have a right to tell them how they choose to play. What you find boring is another man's fun. It's the game that creates boredom. Like the latest recent flop. We looked to CCP create something fun and it sucked from top to bottom. We were simply part of their loot box test. 
---
CCP needs to change their strategy. Not the player. 
---
Broadcasting for reps is for cowards like /u/cyentw
---
Because obviously people need to move their hundred man titan fleets to kill a Rorqual and anything less is too easy an entry to the business of killing random PvE ships.
---
Mining is boring but makes money and lets me watch YouTube, but I can do that without Eve.
---
PvE is boring, makes less money, and requires doing the exact same thing over and over for hours/days/weeks.
---
Large scale PvP has a lot of dead time doing nothing waiting for people to organize just to go to a system with severe tidi and it takes 4 hrs for a 45min fight.
---
Small scale PvP consists of trying to bait idiots into overwhelming beat downs, not "fair fights"
---
Eve is a job for many, and I just want to jump in and get in a fight before my wife says I've been on the PC too long.  But you have to grind cash to be able to join a big fight that takes forever and you may have to log off in the middle of (or dock up after it finishes in a hostile area)
---
Can someone please explain me hows in the age of free citadels you can still die in a JF in lowsec?! 
---
Athanor's can't kill it for sure. They do 880 DPS with Standup Cruise Missiles, 2640 Alpha every 3s. The Anti-Cap one's apply less damage I believe since cyno Inhib has a 400m signature radius.   
---
Tatara's can slowly punch through it if you only have one remote rep type. Especially if they use standup fighters, but they are shootable. 
---
Ol'wormhole glory days
---
I voted for Suitonia because I thought he was meant to be the low sec/FW guy? Suitonia? 
---
The range on the inhib can be tweaked, but I think there's a good case to be made that making it that large is OP and will cause additional issues that will have to be addressed. 
---
I still think it's the citadel here that's the problem. If the citadel hadn't been here, this entire issue would have been moot. 
---
if you want a short meaningless fight to go sisi
---
tell me how long it took to get bored of that 
---
Well, that is a TEST Revenant, which as you know Brave has no power to control (although we have told him that dropping in GE- is stupid). We can set internal policies on not dropping caps in Catch, and not provide logistical support to those who do, but we can't really stop our allies if they choose to do so.
---
I don't even own a rorq. 
---
More meaningful and engaging isk making opportunities without the need to put 1.1 bill isk on the line. 
---
Rorqual mining is literally making me dumber by the minute and if you do not do industry the isk yield per hour is nowhere near comparable to what you put on the line. And Ishtar ratting is just booooring. 
---
Abyssal space scratches that particular itch pretty well but if you want to run t4s you put 1.1 bill at least on the line and hope your isp won't fuck up your connection. And going to t3s is simply not profatible enough if you take into account that you essentially need to haul your produce through half the universe to jita in order to get somewhat decent prices.
---
I think the new events are interesting test cases for new age if pve but overall they and their rewards have been pretty underwhelming.
---
Tldr gieb interesting pve content that has reasonable isk/hour yields. 
---
One dread for one subcap, hmm.
---
&gt; The problem is not in inhib ... but in panic and rorqual.
---
You nerf the inhib you nerf the capability of mega alliances instantly saving anyone in distress in their regions.
---
You nerf the PANIC you nerf the smalltime miners' capability of defending themselves, which will just be another motivation to move in a mega empire space. Mega alliance Rorquals don't even use PANIC that much. 
---
Guess where StainGuy's allegiances lie at.
---
What's embarrassing is that you keep dancing for my entertainment. 
---
I feel like I should be tipping you one dollar bills or something at this point. 
---
I left soon after fozziesov hit and I think there was an issue with titan jump ranges. I didn't leave just because of that, I had a lot of stuff happen in life, but I just didn't get the new sov and spent most my time confused 😂
---
Add in dual timers and I’m sold 
---
CCP Guard: Best Guard! Best CCP also!
---
This applies to every super umbrella, including my own. If you think mistakes don't happen or different levels of competency within a group don't exist, then this is a waste of time.
---
The key point is increasing the level of competency required by the person tackled + the responders to a point where it takes more brainpower than a rock to survive being dropped.

---
&gt;However, perhaps consider it may not be the game design that is boring? But the way you are playing it? 
---
No. Its EVE (and CCP).
---
Space is distance as measured by time it takes to get to you enemy.
---
As someone who has actually left the game there is only one problem in eve: **There isn't enough space in a space game.** Because there isn't enough space the maximum population of EvE online will always be *naturally capped*. This number while ultimately unknown is the reason why EvE soft-capped at 65,303 (2013-05-05 19:09:04) during the period of the fountain war.
---
Why is space an issue? Because enemies will naturally hunt each other to extinction. The ability of alliance to relocate to another section of space requires that their is room to do so. So in order for them to relocate they must first displace the local residence. This generates conflict (good), but it also generates **extinction** (very bad), as one side must either displace or ceast to exist. With EvE Online being saturated in Nullsec with near optimal usage of space. Players natural "retire" at and during the end of conflict as their is no continuation of their game play.
---
"But Nullsec is empty!"
---
Its not, Nullsec is a Sin wave. There are sharp peaks of high density of players in one to two systems, surrounded by sharp valleys of "buffer" space. Sometimes this buffer zone is measured in entire regions. The position of alliances in the game is dictated solely by this factor. Even CCP acknowledges that space is an issue with their capital tweaks. For example, CCP gave us the following:
---
* Space aids
---
* Doubled the cost of space gas
---
* Shortened the range of all caps
---
Why did they change these things specifically? Because capital ships could go across the galaxy in 10-15 minutes flat. Which means that any fight that happened was always in danger of being escalated by the enemy. But think back to the original statement of space and time as distance. CCP increased the distance of all enemies with that patch. *In my humble opinion they didn't go far enough.*  
---
Smaller interceptors can cross eve in very short amount of time. A fact that leads to the tactic of bat phoning for friends, and in these TiDi capital ship slug fests that can last a whole day, anyone has the time to show up with any number of friends. Because the distance is too small the game is n+1 where n is the number of players you can bring and +1 is the "allies" you can call to battle. These leads to not having the decision space to be aggressive, and instead alliance leaders HAVE to be diplomatic, and passive to the will of allies as they need to increase the "friends space" of their alliance in order to survive... The most aggressive alliances in EvE naturally are snuffed out, or move the wormhole space, in which is another type of game inside a game which I won't cover. (Wormholes decrease distance which is also bad #removeWormholers) 
---
So where does that leave us? Stagnate, that's where. CCP knowingly or unknowingly choose to increase distance through other more perverse means. Everyone hates citidel timers, so why did they do it? Because space is also time, and the only way CCP saw to increase space was to increase the time it took to fight someone. You can fit more "hardened" players into a smaller amount of space if an attacker is unable to evict them. This also gives the defenders more time to increase their "friend space", and thus survive the aggressor.
---
Boring. 
---
Some people call nullsec the big blue donut, and at times it is that way. If your in a big alliance, the number of people you can't shoot is at times larger than the number of people your "allowed". Nullsec has become peaceful punctuated by short bursts of violence. All of which are "bad". But why does it have to be so? CCP has the ability to increase the space, but they choose not to. Every decision they make aims to increase the number of combatants in a single battle. Jump clones? Have 6. Titans? Everyone gets one. Wormholes? Their is one where you want to go. 
---
But no one stopped to ask if this made sense? Why should an Alliance be able to attack and defend? Why should an Alliance be able to defend multiple regions? Why should we put all of own players into a single Alliance? Why does there always seem to be only two sides to every conflict?
---
And so here we are.
---
What would bring me back? More space, and less "friends".
---
I don't get why people care so much about Injectors, honestly.
---
Before injectors if I wanted a Rorq alt I bought it on the Character Bazaar.  It cost about as much ISK (or real world money converted into ISK) as it costs me today to buy skill injectors and make my own Rorq alt.  \*\*The only thing that changed is that I get to pick the name of my character now\*\*.
---
Why is this such a horrible, game breaking change versus the Character Bazaar that existed forever?
---
Lets be perfectly blunt, V0LTA is no different in this regard. Your killboard pages are filled with daily high sec ganks, rorq and krab super kills. Please don't pretend that you go out of your way to hit a rorq in Cobalt Edge(https://zkillboard.com/kill/75504760/) because you are expecting a gud fite.
---
And when you do engage some Provi Drakes in gudfite conditions, you get something like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/75483782/. 
---
So bitching about all null blocks being shit, only hunting ratting ships, while doing basically the same thing is a big thinking. 
---
Bring back passive moon isk
---
I want sub capital roams to be relevant again. Everything in eve right now feels like it's for medium-large scale conflicts everything has a fucking timer. The trend has switched from solo/small gang tight knit groups vs 30-40 man defence fleets to just dropping supers on anything with a pulse. 
---
Capital ships are broken and shouldn't be the best choices for PVE. When a Nidhoggur applies more DPS to an afterburning frigate than a Talwar or Cormorant does, you get the current eve. Everything is about generating pings in discord while line members play other, better games until they get told to login. 
---
eve has lost a lot of dynamic content and fun due to caps. I'm subbed right now but mostly in maintenance mode just training skills and logging in to say hi to my corp every week or so. I'd seriously come back if CCP nuked capitals and made sub-capitals roams relevant again. 
---
There's no counter to stall/prevent the umbrella from coming on grid? None at all? Really? 
---
Still an improvement over getting caught by a bunch of 12km/s fighters coming at you from 50km away, in addition to forcing the escalation to be bigger.
---
LR titans being broken is a different problem, but afaik at least from my experience a LR titan doesn't hit small stuff going max transversal from 200km very well.
---
Jesus you're bad at this
---
When it comes to big fleet fights it gets really old fighting over the some big ass structures and having to come back later to actually kill them. It seems like a quick decisive strike by an alliance would generate way more action if we didn't have to ref structures.
---
Thats probably a few years before my time. Im thinking 2014-2016 era
---
Noone looked to CCP for events, they just started doing them and most people didn't give half a fuck even before the last awful event killed off whatever interest there was.
---
Not really sure what I'm trying to say here except that CCP have NEVER been the major push that makes people undock, something something sandbox.
---
You don't lose anything on SISI.

---
I can agree to the ultimate victory part. At one point my alliance was locked in permawar with another alliance. It was us or them. Their goal was to destroy our will to fight, and force us to disband. Our goal started as survival, but I took that too far. After 8 months of lowsecurity/high security conflict their will broke first.  
---
They don't exist anymore. They had been the major pirate dirt bags of Minmatar lowsec. They had been the mouthiest douche bags to smack in local space.   
---
They were the best opponents ever, and I killed that.   
---
I now acknowledge this as a colossal error. Within a year my alliance had no direction, no real opponents, and had devolved into a few scattered ops. Listless, pilots began to drift away. My alliance drank from ultimate victory, and then real defeat - at our own hands.  
---
Your goals matter. EVE is greatest as a game of mutual conflict. Not soul crushing boredom. Fights should be organized to try the skills of FC and fleet alike - not so heavily weighted to assure one side easy victory.   
---
I call this real sportsmanship. I've pvp'ed in all areas of this game. To me the best fights are the hard ones, not the easy wins. 
---
He cares I think, did he get on? 
---
Hey, you stole my list.
---
Though I would add removing capital cap boosters (because neuting is fun and used to be a viable mechanic against capitals) and a rebalance of PvE rewards (because recruiting is shit since you cannot compete with sov 0.0 income.)
---
'Guys it's easy, just make a conscious decision to let other to steamroll &amp; get nice things while You don't'

Put yourself in the shoes of a defender. How do you ensure that you've got enough coverage, no matter the time zone, to defend a structure against an opposing fleet?

Best way to ensure action is to give both sides a chance to form. That's why the system is as it is.

---
I'm not clear on the distinction, could you explain it to us?
---
Solo FW fighting is a great way to pay for your pvp ships while pvping because you can easily run plexes and get LP in your pvp ship.
---
I am personally a fan of gallente for FW. Tristans and comets both have multiple viable fits for plex fighting which can help you learn about range control, transversal, and analyzing your matchups. 
---
I strongly recommend recording your fights to get better. Frigate fights happen so fast (usually less than a minute) that you miss important details in the heat of the moment when you are still learning.
---
Yahtzee. 
---
How is an invalid accusation like this allowed to be kept up?   
---
Surely this is harassment now ?

Nor is nostalgia. Adapt or die.

---
You can consider what you like, doesn't mean that you're not an idiot though.
---
You can't. But you can stall them. Drag bubbles in the direction of citadels on grid. Which is specifically what OP noted as one of the things you can do besides the cyno inhib. 
---
Middle out.
---
This is a myth but ok
---
calm down dude
---
&gt;I blame the eSports slant the game has taken recently, any why I'm hoping we might see the old style AT replaced with something better resembling a test of the fleet combat skills that actually decide the fights that matter.
---
what the fuck
---
u/WallymartsEve said it better
---
&gt; the elected official is required to represent the whole of the constituency, not merely those who voted for him or her, or who participated in the election. 
---
This sounds all good except nobody is doing it. So people choose those who CAN represent their interests the best, which is what they should do. If, despite this, the elected body does not approximate the diversity of the backgrounds in the voting population, then there is something wrong with your political system.
---
&gt; There's an entire body of law designed to help address the shortcomings. 
---
"Lobbyist" shouldn't be a thing in a functioning democracy.
---
&gt; You know you're full of shit at least in that regard.
---
Notice we did not have an argument on how representative democracy works in practice. We had an argument on how it should work, and how an elected body should look like. You have no normative problem with an all-white male congress/senate, whereas I do. My theory training could actually be superior to your practical knowledge with respect to this question.
---
Uhhhh I'd be careful propositioning a minor like that if I was you.
---
Some of your professional colleagues may have anecdotal tales on how that can turn out quite badly.
---
why not link the individual kills instead of a BR spanning 2 weeks?
---
What do you have in mind as a better way? 
---
Rollback to crucible 
---
I can tell you for a fact that the CSM has been of value both to the players and to CCP. CCP didn't keep spending money on it for no reason.
---
But if you don't like the idea of the players choosing their representatives to CCP, then what system would you prefer? CCP choosing who they want to deal with on an accountable and NDA'd basis? Or perhaps they could be... \*guided\* in their choices? Guided by \*sensible people\*, perhaps? People like...
---
...you?
---
personally, a full wipe. or a new server entirely. i know this sounds incredibly extreme considering the significant time and financial investment of most players, but as a 10 year veteran of eve, there is just tooo much.
---
i play alot of survival mmo games, such as atlas or ark, and in those games, losing base or ship or tame, is actually painful. but in eve you can lose a carrier, a CAPITAL SHIP, every week if you insure it and are an efficient ratter or miner.
---
Ihubs have killed the income and farming part of the game because there is so much isk and mineral production it is staggering. infinite combat sites, infinite mining belts leaves little to no reason to take more space if you already have some. there is almost no point in large scale engagements because popping a few titans and a butt-load of caps is barely scratching the surface. even losing a fleet of t3's isnt the biggest blow in the world. this is even worse for smaller scale pvp because the time and effort it takes to destroy and enemy is neglible compared to the affect of taking out an enemy ship. the best thing to do to hurt someone is to cloak up in their system after downtime and afk for 16 hours. Get rid of IHubs at the very least, or just straight up reset all isk and asset apart from skins, skillpoints and skilltrading/plexing
---
Pretty much. It's pretty much a function of having the shiny toys and the latitude to use them.
---
I'm too far gone.
---
I'll take the bait.
---
&gt;Small scale PvP should really be a gateway drug into bigger fights.
---
So, fights where you pilot your own ship in real time should be a gateway drug into fights where you anchor and wait on FC instructions to do anything while praying that your commands will actually go through and your modules will activate?
---
&gt;Instead, low level PvP is dominated by risk averse autists flying blinged out shit and feeling elite because their snake set lets them outrun the newbee and his handful of buddies looking for a good time.
---
How can you spot spodbrain from thousands of km away?  Complains about kiting and calls small gang "risk averse".  
---
The reality is that most small gang players spend their time pvping - not krabbing - and each loss for them matters a hell of a lot more than your average player.  Further, the ships/pods required to fight on grid with fighters are greater a loss (and far more likely to be lost) than the capital ships usually fielded against them.
---
Even caps aside, there's a lot of risk in traditional small gang engagements, as you'd expect from being outnumbered on hostile grids.  I started out pvping in EVE in Brave standing fleet tackling nano ships (pre-ADC), learning that small gangs actually have a lot to fear from well-piloted interceptors and the like.  There's actually tons of both risk and fun on each side of that engagement, but sadly CCP has completely fucked things up and you rarely get to see it anymore.
---
&gt;a test of the fleet combat skills that actually decide the fights that matter.
---
At the risk of shattering your whole little world, I'm going to let you in on a fundamental truth:  **there are no fights that matter in EVE**.
---
A lot of people still pretend they matter, but in reality it's all propaganda fed to line members so that EVE remains a fun game for at least someone to play.  
---
Nearly everything that could conceivably lost in a large battle is already replaced by the time it ends thanks to all the rorquals and bots out there.  And anything smaller than an all-out cap brawl isn't even a blip on the radar.  Even losing a war doesn't matter, as there's always 1) asset safety, and 2) space that is equally profitable somewhere else to take.  *(And that's assuming some group is actually insane enough to not only take all of your space, but structure grind the entire thing as well.  Much more likely they'll settle for a peace deal of some sort, as we've seen.)*
---
Do supers and titan pilots loose SP along with their ship in the same way T3 cruisers do? If that's not a thing that should definitely be a thing
---
this too, especially when i have 5-6 accounts that i can sub. thats a new $60 AAA game every month
---
:D
---
This but unironically.
---
Of course they are. Why else do they release update after update. New expansions. More skills. More ships. It's about getting people back into the game. The problem is with the "end game". Alliances, sov, making it into a Titan, super wealth... all do nothing to keep people playing. The true core of this game is with sub-caps and small fleets. Until things change where these fleets can have clear goals and objectives without caps, then we get bored. 
---
No dude, kill hawks next please, Novac are innocent dread blobbers.
---
No time like the present. The best corps for very new players are Pandemic Horde (no API needed), Karmafleet (goons), and Eve University. 
---
Some of the monkeys arent f1 bashers...some are logi monkeys...hic/dic bubble monkey...boosh monkey...the i'll do my own thing monkey...etc etc
---
Negatory, reduction to absurdity would be if you said something like 
---
"Buff inhibs and the next thing they'll be asking for is to remove industrial cores and panic modules", or "buff inhibs and no rorq will ever undock again", which is implying a ridiculous consequence of the opponent's argument. 
---
You twisted OP's argument into something it's not, then implied their argument was ridiculous, which is text-book straw man. If you insist on splitting hairs. 
---
but they do drop caps in GE- :thinking:
---
There are some legitimate issues (adjusting to the meta is much quicker), but really, people are wrapping up their overall frustration/malaise with an aging game by raging at whatever scapegoat they feel like hitting at the moment.  Injectors, bots, whatever.
---
Games old, glory days are likely gone, people have based their identities around spaceships, feel losss, so rage.
---
This is such a stupid post it makes me hurt inside... 
---
Big mega alliances aren't going to risk failing at major engagements to make the fight more interesting or entertaining... they are fighting for the future of everything they have built
---
And if minor corps with a few carriers and dreads are fighting and 25 Titans with faxes drop them it doesn't matter if they turn on the Titans or not they are dead anyway
---
That also means that ships are worthless. Half the reason feroxes are OP right now is because they cost next to nothing to replace. Losing a ship should have some kind of meaning.
---
You do realize there's a "dock" button on the Keepstar, right?
---
no
---
&gt; There's also Steel's expert leadership, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Karl Marx's literature, for instance.
---
This, but unironically.
---
&gt;In fact, Skill Injectors had almost no change on EVE
---
If you are so blind as to think this, then you're a part of the reason that this game's glory days are in the past. In fact, I might even label you as more dumb than I am. Lmfao, OP, you're more retarded than Chevis. Now make like a mittani fanfest presentation and never log in again.

---
Shut the literal fuck up
---
The difference is that someone had to go through the effort of slowly training up those alts to the point where they were valuable. Yes you could have bought w character day one but the mechanic didn't allow for people to train like 100 rorq alts at once and sell them the demand was no where near high enough and the cost of subbing an account for like 2 years or whatever was prohibitive on it's scaling. Now people can run 100s of skill farm characters which are paying for themselves every month with very little upfront cost comparatively which produce something which will always have high demand and be valuable.  
---
Don’t give them any ideas

How is it a myth? If you're not in someone's home, they can only drop 3 caps.

---
Wormholes being "everything fun and interesting."
---
Premise: rorquals
---
Suggestion: rollback to 2012 and never implement them in the first place
---
I think you get rid of the damage cap on low power structures so that you can clear those off faster. 
---
As for ones that are actively being contested, I think the current system is probably better than many of the alternatives. I still think time zoning tanking is a problem, but I can't come up with anything that better balances the issues with it. 
---
&gt; You can't.
---
Exactly what I meant.
---
&gt; But you can stall them if the cyno in somewhere else. 
---
And this is why the inhib should force defenders to light their cynoes "somewhere else". At least outside of LR weapons, doomsdays, and immediate fighter burning range.
---
And then it'd become an interactive game where people could outsmart each other by cyno positioning and bubble positioning.
---
The fighters are almost never an issue tbh because you're typically 200km off. The real issue we encountered was when they tried to stagger bombs+cruises and had some subcaps there to try and shoot it from LR. Didn't do much mind you, but that's about it.
---
Hey now. Do I look like I'm in black legion? 
---
triggered goons. 
---
Imagine sticking up for a known input broadcaster.
---
Well, I was just running with it. I don't know the fellow well enough to go off half dubbed. I stay where I am because I like the people.
---
The issue is rapid optimization, before the rorqual changes there were not nearly as many rorqual characters as there are now and character farmers would be making a much more significant investment into a specific area in terms of skillbook costs and risk of that area being popular. Now people are able to instantly take advantage of changes and so balance and iteration is needed much more frequently and/or needs to be more reserved. This would normally lead to slower adoption of changes as speculative character training tended to be on older high sp characters with nothing better to train.
---
Lelob is Right.
---
You don't find role playing a rabbit in a den of foxes to be fun and interesting?
---
I mean I do, but I get that it's not for everyone.
---
What happened to that one?
---
I wish there was more NPSI communities to fight each other. I havent been in a corp or alliance since co2 tribute/impass and now I just run incusions and fly around solo looking for fights and ganks. I wish there was somewhere to go where people actually looked to form npsi fleets that isnt just spector or bombars bar simply looking for content. To this day I never understood why everyone shit on gigx for what he did and how that slime ball csm member the judge got him banned,  it truely was a huge loss for the game. 
---
Wormhole space to be not dead.
---
I didnt leave by choice. My computer bricked in 2017 and I've not been able to afford a new one. Played since '08 before that.
---
If he was broadcasting they should all have been cloaked, no?
---
Not having to grind so much time into playing middle game fighting.  More dynamic grinding.  Incursions being a good example of dynamic PVE.  More of that please.  Exploration is the other shining example as it requires less of a skill point barrier of entry.  Capitol fights need to be encouraged more often to actually cut down on brinkmanship and MAD (mutually assured distruction) style gameplay and encouraging (Mutually assured distraction) style gameplay.  I miss you Gimly, Ben and Neil.  The game has become a hobby not a game.  I just don't have the time as not quite middle income earner trying to balance life and video games.  I play with more IRL friends now than internet friends.  Again, balance of life. 
---
Nerf their bandwidth to 1 excavator.
---
It would require a few big changes to the game. 
---
-FW sites would need the ship size restrictions removed. This would lead to larger ships being used to take sites.
---
-Low sec gate guns need to be reworked to shoot anyone with a suspect/criminal timer like it was before the changes. Currently ships can shoot someone, warp off and warp back without any gate guns on them. Might as well not have gate guns at all. This again would bring back the BS/ BC meta instead of a frigate beats all meta. 
---
-Capital ships need to be reworked to jump to a random location around the star instead of exact point in system. Pinpoint cyno would be cov ops speciality. 
---
-Dreadnaughts gain the ability to use a DD at the expense of self-destructing the dread at the end of the cycle. 
---
-Dreadnaughts / Titans lose HAWs 
---
-Carriers / Supers lose light fighters and only use SS and Heavy fighters. 
---
-Damage limits removed on citadels and gain a massive HP boost. 
---
-Citadels weapons reworked to kill subcaps but have weapon systems that can be offlined through hacking or shooting the weapons
---
-Rats gain a significant damage bonus and no additional payout when capitals land in site. 
---
-harvester drones increased in size so as to not fit in a mobile depot. 
---
You post a random battle report from different days showing goon losses. and try to say there's someone more triggered than you in this thread?
---
Previously the amount of characters to fly said rorqs was limited. 
---
Today it isn't in any meaningful way.
---
Want 500 maxed rorq pilots? Easy peasy if you're rich either individually or as a group. 
---
No Jump Fatigue, abolish tethering, and AT. 
---
Upvotes for awareness, EvE is small.
---
I'm loving the amount of chatlogs posted in this.
---
How high are you?
---
Under valued post.
---
&gt; Prior to skill injectors if I wanted a Rorq alt (or any other kind of character), even if I was a one day old account, I could easily go to the character bazaar, swipe mommy's credit card and obtain said alt. Today with skill injectors I do the same exact thing (the cost is fairly comparable as well), except I buy skill injectors instead of a character.  
---
Because there was a semblance of a market. There was a supply and demand for specific skills. 
---
Now you have skill farms churn out generic SP you turn into whatever you want. 
---
Before if you wanted to buy a rorq pilot someone else had to have a rorq pilot for sale. 
---
Want 10 rorqual, buy the SP. Before if you wanted 10 rorq pilots, supply was small and you'd compete with others.
---
IMO CCP should have merged the two concepts. You train a specific skill to sell that specific skill.
---
Get rid of excavators, nerf them with a lower bonus to mining drone 2s. Problem solved. 
---
pussy!
---
i mean he ain't wrong.
---
wormholes are fun and interesting.
---
the problem is, they aren't fun or interesting enough to want to deal with the absolute cancer that is logistics in a wormhole.
---
&lt;100 people is pretty small scale. Just because they were powerful doesn’t mean they are big
---
So OP is lying? Or that's an exception. Either way, this guy was talking about an Impass drop to de-legitimize the claim above.
---
The hypothesis is that it "glitched", and a subset of his many alts did not cloak
---
Wait, I was supposed to pay rent?
---
I’m preparing my karma butthole for a deluge of downvotes but.... meaningful PVE. I absolutely love the space genre and the fitting ‘puzzle’ of min maxing stuff for maximising my profit content.
---
I don’t care if I get hunted by predators who want to kill me and steal my space loot. What I want is meaningful missions. Abyssal space broke it up for a while but it very quickly became way too repetitive... 
---
If CCP overhauled their PVE content I would be back almost instantly.
---
Bring on the downvotes. Sorry for being a filthy carebear casual.
---
More like 2-6 FCs per side, with anywhere from 2-15+ specialist roles. Anchors, logi, tacklers, booshers, boosters, hunters, scouts, spies, probers, etc. If pressing F1 bores you, get into one of the specialist roles. Then your decisions matter even in big fights. Being an F1 monkey should be the gateway drug to getting to specialist and FC roles where the real skill and fun is.
---
It's such a gross over simplification to assume that every big fight is just 1 FC fighting another FC with a bunch of mindless drones.
---
Lol at half the screen opsec chat
---
A lot of us did the big fights, realised how boring and skillless it is to be a line member and moved onto learning how to actually PvP and fly small gang

I'm the one bitter vet who is still salty as fuck over walking in stations. I was so stoked to be able to own a bar in a station and gamble there for isk. What was pitched for WIS was so up my alley that no other game mattered at all. Then they cancelled it....... 
---
ok, and?
---
The client isn't single threaded. Server yes (but not entirely. the solar system simulation is. Other stuff is hived off already), Client no.
---
There's always \_some\_ stuff which runs in a single thread. Because part of the simulation is replicated on the client. This is to avoid having to send all the data to every client. So the physics simulation (as far as I understand it) is redone on every client. They just get updates when something changes. like someone starts going in another direction.
---
This is the 'cause' of the desync rubberbanding. Because your simulation, and the server simulation, are out of lockstep.  (exactly what causes \_that\_ is something CCP are always working on, and closing down the various reasons)

It's pretty much impossible to lose a super or titan, so that wouldn't make any difference.
---
Rorquals are fine...panic mods are the problem. Just get rid of them.
---
It’s allowed the rorq / super / Titan proliferation to get out of hand. 
---
Only an idiot would post waterstamped chat logs- But Init are going back to Fountain- claiming they could not fight under the super cap umberalla- not once in this deployment have PL or NC deployed any supers- Init got beaten  down every time on sub caps

Huge logistics nerf. Brining nano back.

And on top of this, everyone seems to think it goes straight from micro gang shenanigans straight to bullshit tidi slugfest. There is quite a lot of in-between, and it can get quite intensive especially if you're multi boxing during these fights.

---
The reason for conflict, drivers of it, and mechanics have gone stale. There are richer gaming experiences elsewhere.
---
1. clear separation of uses for caps and sub-caps in several different aspects of the game. Caps should only be used in the final stages for sov and fighting other caps. Sub-caps need more roles and goals in sov and wars. Sub-caps need fleet objectives... more reasons to form small gangs. More reasons to roam enemy space or defend your own. 
---
2. faction warfare needs a big change
---
3. Jita needs to just die and players/corps need better reasons to buy/sell in different areas... perhaps implementing stores?
---
4. Bounty systems need a re-haul. 
---
5. Mission runners need chances at faction drops
---
6. Gankers need more risk, as the wealth is so huge that ganking is now done for fun (griefing) and not profit.
---
7. New space, more regions, new races, new ships
---
8. New systems that limit ship types, new regions that prohibit caps. I'd love 2 types of new space... one for cruisers and below... another for battleships and below. No sov null sec regions, no structures, back to old school eve. Just a few NPC stations and lots of small fleet roams.  
---

Which is funny, considering that it was all-white rich congresses that created the Bill of Rights, ended slavery, created social security, medicare, the Civil Rights Act, among a variety of other things that went directly against their class interests. 
---
&gt; If, despite this, the elected body consistently does not reflect the approximate diversity of the backgrounds in the voting population, then there is something wrong with your political system.
---
Now you're arguing for identity politics, claiming that someone who is not part of a group is incapable of representing those who are. That's fundamentally anti-democratic. You might as well be arguing for homogenous polities. That's not realistic. 
---
&gt; "Lobbyist" shouldn't even be a thing in a functioning democracy.
---
You might as well say that lawyers shouldn't be a thing in a functioning legal system. Letting others hire experts to represent them has been part of legal and governmental systems since forever. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with it.

&gt; My theory training could actually be superior to your practical knowledge with respect to this particular question.

having a good time in low/null sec, when I played (as an alpha), it always was super hard to go anywhere without getting camped/killed, really took the fun out of the game

While I think that skill injectors are a net positive addition it does come with one big downside:
---
I spend quite a bit of time in the "help" and "rookie chat" channels assisting newbies and one thing many new players become focused to the point of obsession with flying the biggest, meanest ships as soon as possible. With skill injectors you can now grind for skill points in a visible way, like a traditional MMO. 
---
Many new players, accustomed to games like WOW and FFXIV, have their eyes set on the "endgame" and end up crabbing to hard that they get bored, burn out and quit.
---
Before skill injectors people were more focused on the here-and-now, people can and do sabotage their own enjoyment of the game.
---
Grr INIT for trying to create content
---
I started with inferno and it was a really fun time back then.
---
Finding content in wormholes takes an unreasonable amount of time and there's no way to force people to fight. The average wormhole dweller will just dock and wait until they can undock enough people to have zero chance of losing... Which typically takes a few hours.
---
and only an idiot expects to be taken seriously without having any evidence to present.
---
&gt; but the mechanic didn't allow for people to train like 100 rorq alts at once 
---
Not true at all. This is exactly the direction that the bazaar was going.
---
Two of my own alts were done by someone who was training 10 ishtar ratting alts at a time and flipping them.
---
The forum had much bigger sellers who were selling hundreds of carrier pilots, because at the time, carrier ratting was just starting to explode.
---
Yeah it's a lot easier now, but character training itself had been going in the same direction.
---
Has eve gotten significantly worse over the past 3-5 years?  I have the impression it has.  It's had no significant or serious updates, and the "new" space was a huge let down and the new stations are rolling out to slowly. 
---
I'm not completely out of the game but I've spent a lot less time subscribed and played in the last year for that reason. There's only so many times I can rescue the damsel before thinking "sod it, she can save herself this time".
---
Anything less than causing another B-R over a rorqual is clearly a free kill
---
Tracking titans were nerfed into the ground with the cap gun changes. Now you get the same effect with HAW titans.
---
Which reminds me - HAWs should not go on titans. 
---
No, I'm arguing the converse -- because a given player is afraid of appearing to lose large amounts of isk, they constrain themselves to the subset of activities that fit within their shriveled margin of acceptable loss.
---
There's no viable way to challenge any of the current blocs. Even the largest groups cannot feasibly threaten eachother in their own space, and the best they can do is trade titans for keepstars in 10 hour battles - which will result in both sides getting burnt out before any meaningful damage is done.
---

Ask INIT where they should be right now, as of yesterday the deployment is over- they should move back to J5A- 
---
&gt;it's not a problem
---
having to do the washing up after dinner isn't a problem either. doesn't mean it's fun or that i want to spend my time doing it.
---
moving shit in and out of a wormhole is like doing the dishes - it's not that big of a deal but i can think of a billion other things i'd rather be doing.
---
yeah thrashers definitely the meta to create content in eve 2k19
---
or you could just post proof, since... y'know, you're the one making claims.
---
So why haven't you biomassed (in game) yourself?
---
*grabs botcorn
---
Injectors increased the supply of any type pilot you'd want thousandfold.
---
And to add to that the new role of Rorqual, which increased mining output per alt to 2-3x (at time of change it was 5x hulk's output lol), suddenly you have a ton more ore flowing in -&gt; huge increase in super production.
---
So now you have excess supers, hey wait, you can instant inject to a super pilot too! Don't need to worry about the supply of these either.
---
The difference between now and then is time , of course people could just train 100 rorquals alts at the same time or titan pilots , it to years to train , so even if you had mommy’s credit card you couldn’t buy 20 rorqual rooms or titans on the bazar because there was a limitation of them , nowadays with injectors you just create new ones in “seconds” , so there is no limit .. that’s the main difference.. 
---
Why should it not be ? Cheap and efficent ship that you can welp. Creates lots of content.
---
Neato &lt;3 , the link in your video description is wrong though. https://i.imgur.com/Qy6lLtd.png
---
Don’t leave me out I talked mad shit too. Fuck loro. 
---
HK will never be gone as long as they continue to live rent free in the heads of every init member
---
Yup.
---
This is a good explanation. 
---
The amount of people that talk through their ass without understanding how a game server and a game client interact never ceases to amaze me.
---
They think slow down and lag in big fights is caused by the client side and not server side processing. Then make posts like this with factually incorrect information to push a stupid narrative (eve client is single threaded lawl, ccplease).
---
The point of 64-bit client is not to fix tidi or fleet fights. The only real difference we should notice is higher ram usage and in the future maybe better graphics fidelity with DX12 and other modern rendering capabilities. It basically just allows for more textures/objects to be loaded into ram before a crash to desktop occurs (At 3gb with 32-bit). What this will (theoretically) fix is disconnect/crashes when there are a lot of objects on grid to be loaded into the client's memory.
---
CPU usage doesn't even really factor in as an issue on the client side, maybe GPU rendering effects if you have a potato, but even then the EVE client under-utilizes modern hardware. The reason the game crashes and runs like shit is due to memory limitations of 32-bit instructions.
---
The CPU usage bottleneck that is occurring (potato computers aside) is entirely server side. As it processes all the commands players are sending, player locations, damage calculations, various database calls, and feeds some of that information back to the thousands of connected clients so that the game world can be rendered accurately. A good majority those things have to happen in order for seamless game-play.
---
It's hilarious to me that people think "simply" multi-threading that would solve all problems without realizing that it would be insanely difficult to do without causing race conditions and massive desync. It's why literally no game developer does it, and instead employ much simpler things like instancing. 
---
TIDI/Lag/slow down, will be a unaffected by 64-bit client.
---
&gt; It isn't, fuck off and leave already.
---
the title of the thread was specifically asking for the opinions of people who have quit
---
Did some one somewhere assume a gender?
---
Thank you very much, fixed!
---
Have you tried living in J-space?
---
The thing is, only small ships that are capable of doing what they need to do and then moving off quickly are capable of operating in Delve without getting blobbed by supers/Titans. 
---
Mar5hy uses bombers because they only need to be decloaked on grid for a few seconds. Olmecca uses booshers because those get a few hundred km off grid in seconds, so he has time before the fighters reach him. 
---
No big, expensive ships are capable of living long enough to get the job done, so small stuff is the only viable option

Wouldn't that be a spot on definition of a glitch? Something went wrong.

That's been a problem with EVE for as long as I've know about it because if it's not krabbing for Injectors it's just krabbing for plex to play for free. Before Injectors if people wanted to fly the biggest and baddest they still had to wait 2-3 years before they could do it and most would just quit.
---
Spelt 'FAX'
---
Yeah he is a current CSM member 
---
The accounts being out of sync is a very common problem when input broadcasting in any game. Half are cloaked, half are not thus hitting the module uncloaks half and cloaks the other. 
---
This is how I used to run my mages out of mana in EQ. Whoopsie they are standing while the healers sit.
---
It's simple. Before skill injectors time was the most valuable asset. Now it's basically your real cash wallet and how much you want to pay to win. Skill injectors did nothing but create an army of bots. 
---
You are perfectly capable of reporting this to the security team yourself if you feel the need &gt;:I
---
Tataras have a 15km model radius. Inhibs leave a 25km radius that isn't touched. That means you can cyno at least 10km away from the citadel even on a fully inhib spammed grid.
---
Ricardo ranchero when?
---
What are you doing in a WH where you have to move things more than once a week in any serious quantity?
---
If they made the changes you are suggesting I think it would be a very boring game
---
Fair enough but my point is the barrier to entry was much much higher with the bazaar especially considering the meta changing could mean over a year of training could be significantly less valuable. 
---
So form Goon pets they become Inti pets. makes sense :lol
---
&gt; risk averse autists
---
&gt; flying blinged out shit and feeling elite because their snake set...
---
We're not your mother. We don't remove threads because you say something someone else doesn't like, propaganda and so on. If you think it's bullshit then say so. Don't cry to mods to censor it on your behalf.
---
A CSM completely dominated by nullsec blocks or even worse, completely dominated by a single nullsec block alliance and its pets is just an utterly waste of time. For the simple fact that no one trusts them to do anything else than pushing their own nullsec agenda. And its this lack of general player trust that is key here. Because why should the average Eve player ever trust nullblocks to look after their interests in the CSM towards CCP if they're playing the game completely different then they do? 
---
CCP should figure out a way to get better CSM representation based on player demographics. Which is technically possible, especially if they ditch the utterly corrupt player election system altogether and handle the CSM applications themselves in a way they would select a focus group. Because in the end, that is what a CSM should be in the first place. All the rest is just fluff.
---
Was a great fight. I Was surprised it ended up being so even isk wise seeing as our dreads all died. 10/10 would brawl again
---
Cuz now the number of rorq pilots is two, instead of one.
---
I don't think injectors are a bad thing (I prob would have quit along time ago if they weren't around, make that with what you will) but I go think that the way they implemented them could have been a little better.   
---
Like only being able to use 1-3 injectors a day so a day 1 pilot can't sit in a titan or by restricting some skills from being injected.
---
Fair enough. 
---
I mean I know what's happening first-hand. I can tell you but you'll keep shittting on him anyway.
---
He broadcasts character selection in increments of 10. It is legal like char creation. Increments of 10, because login process is computationally resource-hungrier. Upon log in, he disables broadcasting and manually cloaks them.
---
He had that local chat incident because he forgot it on. He lost these bombers because he forgot to cloak last batch fo his logins. He is not banned because he didn't commit any rule breach, except broadcasting incident in local, which did not result any unfair advantage for him (which is CCP's ban criterion).
---
So yeah, by all means Goons can keep at the metagame harassment but that's the explanation of anything Mar5hy related.
---
What is an off-grid cyno for 500, Alex
---
eve has always been pay2win.  see Plex.  
---
Now how do you get that?  Wormhole
---
Can you imagine doing all that outside of tidi, whenever you want, wherever you want, with 10-20 of your good friends? Crazy.
---
I was a Nullsec alliance CEO running a 100+ man PVP corp. I had 2 subs. I left eve almost 10 years ago, ***and the same shit that caused me to leave is still there today***. There are 3 reasons I left:
---
* 1) I got a job so I can't sit for 3-5 contiguous hours anymore. My time is broken up and I may only have a half hour to play. There is nothing worth doing in Eve in 30 minutes. This means no fleet fights, and long roams are out. Small scale PVP would have brought me back and nearly did, but lowsec or faction warfare keeps going from bad to worse with no attention. If this was fixed, I might come back as a casual, but to make me really invest in the game would mean fixing the other two.  
---
I wish I could login and do PVE. I do that in many other games. Someone in Eve long ago decided that since PVE generated money, it had to be boring.  Ratting is boring, missions are boring, mining is literally a sleep aid. I tried it and lost more ships to falling asleep than anything else. It's not fun. It just isn't. Someone at CCP think's its ok that their PVE isn't fun. That person is wrong.
---
* 2) Economic inflation: The founding principle of Eve is not flying what you can't afford to lose. Problem is, CCP has never controlled the economy carefully and this has led to ever greater concentrations of wealth. Resulting in players and alliances for whom the economic incentives underlying the game no longer function. Eve depends on its death penalty to drive behavior in the game and a non-managed economy always ends up broken. Markets do not self regulate.  CCP once hired an economist, but all he wanted to do was write economics papers and post a blog every so often.  They got an economics professor but they needed a central banker. When he left he wasn't replaced. Now wealth distribution and incomes are unregulated and have been for years, and you see everyone else in this thread complaining about it one way or another.
---
* 3) Broken trust requirements for corps. Maybe this is only visible for CEOs, but there are two kinds of Eve corps: Those who have had their shit stolen, and those who are about to have their shit stolen. This is because identity management in eve is fundamentally impossible without better tools from CCP's side to see who is who. It's too easy to pay for a second account and use it to steal from corps and alliances because there are no risks and no reprecussions. When it's done, you walk away from the account or just train another character for while. No reputation hit, no tracking, no nothing. This is not balanced gameplay, and as a CEO it means I don't want to invest in building up my corp because it's a time bomb waiting to blow up in my face and there's nothing I can do about it.
---
* 4) (bonus) Capital warfare. I'd be happy to rejoin eve and just avoid capital warfare, but i'm not going to pretend super balls, titan blobs, and faxes arent broken. They are. I just think there are ways to enjoy the game even if they are broken, which isn't true of the first 3.  I trained my characters to be cap pilots and I wish I hadn't. It's even more grinding and less fun than being an F1-monkey in a big fleet.
---
Rebalancing how mindless semi- or fully-AFK activities scale extremely well with alts and how multiboxing alts is basically mandatory.
---
&gt;Before Injectors if people wanted to fly the biggest and baddest they still had to wait 2-3 years before they could do it and most would just quit.
---
Yeah, that's just not the case.  You could always krab up the isk/take out the credit card and have a Titan pilot off the bazaar.  Yes, it was a market, and therefore limited, but there was effectively never a point past the early days of Titans that a pilot wasn't available for purchase.
---
Agreed. We have tons of medium sized fleet fights (25-70), and individual player skill definitely factors in. You get a couple of your logi's falling off anchor or getting overloaded unsure sure what to rep first and it's over for you.
---
***Looks at discord.***   
---
***Looks at the other discord.***  
---
***Looks at the first discord.***  
---
Can you screen shot the ping telling us deployment is over? I can't find it...
---
What they need is to expand Eve with new regions of space that don't allow caps, sov, or structures. Old school Eve. New null space connected to existing high sec areas. Just NPC stations and plenty of isk to be made if you can get it out. 
---
  Rollback to 2012
---
All that esports slant, what with the AT being canceled... oh wait...
---
Get rid of anchoring somehow?  Now they would have to fly their ships.
---
We do it basically every day since we typically form 20-60 people.
---
Why not move the rock chunks 400k off?
---
Taking out loot tbh
---
Man if only there was a way that cloaking wasn't an automatic safe space, this wouldn't be an issue. 
---
Oof! I call most people, including my gf b so I dunno what that means
---
And this illustrates my point perfectly. Your definition of "get the job done" includes "moving off quickly." Or, put slightly differently, "don't lose a ship." It's a fear of loss.
---
Bring back POS mechanics
---
Most problems solved
---
Unfueled citadels die the same day
---
Fueled ones die 2 days later instead of a week and then some
---
And remove asset safety so it's actually worth defending citadels
---
I know mate, You have point, -0 but  to keep it simple, just ask if INIT have been told to  deploy back to J5A- if I am wrong  they wont go home, if I am right, then their deployment is over -- don't take my word for it ask the INIT guys
---
True, but the meta of rorqs and supertits being desirable hasn't exactly changed in awhile.  
---
And the barrier to entry of the bazaar was mostly a usability issue, which is a garbage reason to stick with that model.
---
Luckily you preemptively mentioned it, now the downvotes mean you're right.
---
That seems like a terrible idea. Leagues in EVE can't work like they do in ARPG's. Leagues work in those games because _you_ dictate the speed at which you progress. More time invested = more advancement in your character.
---
In EVE, you'd be capped by the speed at which you can train skills. It becomes more time invested != more advancement but, rather, would amplify the existing fact that more money invested = more advancement.
---
End-game content would be completely nonexistent except for those who pay many to get to it since many ships literally can't be trained in under a year, so players who became relevant through years of grinding skills would instantly become irrelevant. Sure, you'd force most people to fly low-tier ships - and simultaneously forcibly lock people out of content they unlocked through years of commitment, which would be a bit of a slap in the face to those people.
---
But sure, if you only to fly low-tier ships against people who pay money to quickly get access to capitals each season, then it's a great idea.
---
good thing that safety in numbers is king in eve, huh? 
---
*There's no capitals in wormholes*
---
You poor child
---
I confirme is use bot or input broadcast for cloak in eso is cloak 60 account in same moment, is not possible for human....
---
Remember the day we found a botting corp and begin to feed on its supers, then Wibla had to kick the corp which has been in the alliance for over a year? 
---
And then, after enjoying 1 year of botting taxes, he marketed as if he is the one identifying them and kicking them?
---
DPCI remembers.
---
Nah. It's what some people do when it's all they have left. Can't beat them in game. Pick up the torches on reddit and show them you can win another way!
---
1st question is what are you trying to accomplish? are you manufacturing a product? is that product in high demand? Are you just mining? are you fighting NPCs and salvaging their ships?
---
hey mav how's your cold?
---
Mostly exploration in nullsec
---
Encourage everyone to store their assets in corp hangars.
---
Right now, Null Sec is a retirement home. Capitals themselves, and their extreme proliferation just flat out denies any newer player alliances any hope of winning Sov for themselves except when they are allowed to. I am sure plenty of players, myself included, would love to be apart of some or any form of strategic planning/execution, creating and testing doctrines (of course the only doctrine that matters is how many Capitals you have), or otherwise have a meaningful impact on the Eve universe, but sadly this privilege is restricted to a small amount of people, and getting to the point of having that privilege requires a great deal of RL money, i.e alts, out of game infrastructure, dedicated IT teams, etc. 
---
Any sub cap fleet undocking from any major coalition is ultimately a "for fun" fleet, no real meaning or consequence. Even if you dunk 80 Muninns, they're legitimately replaced the next day. You can dunk 20 Rorq's and they're replaced in a week, you kill one Titan, sure the individual's wallet is hurt, but when current alliances are making well over 1 trillion monthly, a Titan is a drop in the bucket.
---
You can't even target key infrastructure, because it will all be replaced probably before even the final timer, and if you do somehow by sheer luck win that final timer... they still have their assets.
---
 The only ships that matter right now are the Super, Titan, and the one that lights the Cyno. Everything else is just for funsy.
---
What sort of corp are you looking to create?
---
You can hide passive modules by clicking the three little lines in the bottom left of your capacitor 
---
.
---
oh and, activate windows xD
---
I can do a short write-up if it would help. 
---
As awkward as it is to realize, community managers are not game designers. They are PR. They may contribute some information for PR or business purposes, but analytics show what players are actually doing
---
I trust the professional who is interested in doing a good job to pay their mortgage far more than an amateur CSM member that is interested in winning their game.
---
Not having a community management team does not suddenly make a CSM a good idea.
---
Well not specific skill, maybe category like gunnery or spaceship command.
---
no, they are perturbed because all our friends are quitting, theres barely any reason to still play, the gameplay is stale, boring, the devs dont care anymore and every balance issue is magnified a thousand times by skill injectors.
---
Everyone seems to be talking about pvp but i think in general they are missing the point and should instead focus on what creates and denies content.
---
REWORK PVE! MAKE PVE PASSABLE FOR ONCE. They clearly have the mechanics and ai to do so (see diamond rats, abyss, and events) and by reworking it so that afk drone boats are not the answer you fix like 70% of the ratting problem. This makes isk more important and more importantly puts actual people in space. ACTUAL PEOPLE ARE CONTENT DRIVERS NOT BOTS.
---
On top of this I also think all capital ships(except freighters) need to be nerfed. Dreads should never have gotten the ability to easily apply to sub cabs, carriers can currently put out way to much dps, super carriers are turbo farmers now and should never have been able to clear a subcap anomaly that fast, rorqs have made minerals cheaper than dirt and have ruined any semblance of cost balancing ships, and titans are now mainline dps ships. You can't balance the sub caps against caps, it's stupid to try, instead you should separate sub cap and cap balance making it easier to balance both and then curate their interactions. Honestly if caps become useless at the same time as rorqs people will bitch but won't care cause mineral prices will go up and eventually if they still don't want caps they can exchange them for minerals and make a profit on their dirt cheap capitals.
---
Furthermore if they wanted to do a yearly universe re-balance pass where they shift where faction sites and minerals spawn this could also be a content driver. If you want to maintain the control of the pith market and no longer have guristas in your space guess what, you need to move. If you are focused on creating an industrial empire and your pocket is re-balanced with no belts or mining anomalies guess what, you need to move. This will suck which is why it should be yearly at least but the movement will create conflict or at the very least provide variety and market confusion.
---
Lots of minor fixes, A complete ship re-balance across the board, More ways for flashpoint pvp, making brawlers useful (this kite-y meta is cancer and you know it) 
---
What would really help is npc fleets. There's already code to handle it, and you use your npc fleets to patrol your space. They aren't much of a threat, but they provide something when killed to incentivize people actually going after them. New structures could accommodate this, hell it would be a great way to increase the mineral prices, because if you also had to provide the ships...
---
Capital strip miners ?
---
I just wanted a good group of dudes to hang out with and have fun. I’m focusing on exploration atm
---
Good thing all citadels are keepstars
---
Polarized capital strip miners.
---
That awesome simple and clean interface, sure drones were a mess, but everything else was smooth, much better than the clustefuck of buttons and windows we have right now.
---
~ssshhhh don't give them ideas.
---
shoot structures
---
anchor structures 
---
do their sites 
---
shit talk local 
---
you can't force anyone in Eve to fight on terms favorable to you, this isn't unique to wormholes 
---
Activity begets activity. The single best thing you can do as a CEO is be hyper active. 
---
Unfortunately this leads to burnout, so entrust others to help you keep this torch burning bright
---
&gt; CCP should figure out a way to get better CSM representation based on player demographics.
---
Such as?
---
"without 1000 capitals"
---
"hahaha this kid said there's no caps in wh space" 
---
what a tard lol
---
* Farming skill injectors has placed a HUGE strain on the plex market, inflating the price of skins and game time.  
---
* To buy a Rorqual from the bazaar someone would first have had to train a Rorqual pilot instead of a generic bottle of brain goo.
---
* CCP is infamous for its slow response time to address balance issues.  Once upon a time it would take months for an overpowered ship to be trained in mass.  Now these balance issues can be mass injected and exploited.  
---
Thank you!
---
It's not my hypothesis, so I don't have to defend it. I have no dog in this hunt.
---
and into delve, fountain, esoteria, dronelands and all those other bot infested regions
---
You must have been missing in the last big war...
---
Reset Tranquility, call it Eve 2.0. I know this wont happen, but I can dream.
---
Unfuck Rorqs at the same time. Increase capital and structure material costs across the board, to make structures and capitals worth more. 
---
Get rid of skill injectors, or limit how many sp you can inject per month or something. I realise that injectors are an income source for CCP.
---
Delayed local for null. Possibly low and hisec as well, but this may cause the game to feel empty.
---
Limit how many systems an Alliance can hold based off of the amount of corps/pilots in said alliance, or have space not used by the owners cause structures in said space to decay to the point of destruction, causing loss of ownership.
---
Create an exponential curve of increasing costs for running an alliance as it gets bigger.
---
Risk v Reward rebalance:  
---
Rorqs are bad  
---
ratting supers/carriers were always ok  
---
anom farming in NS is too safe ( isk/h is just right, just needs to be less afk )  
---
anom farming in LS is too risky for reward (DEDs were in a good spot, idk about now)  
---
CCP needs to slamtown bots and multi-broadcast users  
---
incursion reward rebalance, i'd rather nullsec players being able to freefarm incursions for their current returns rather than complete-safety HSers doing so for near the best ISK/H in the game.  
---
**Better moons to WH systems**  
---
wormhole mining is significantly more risk than mining in nullsec, while the returns are gimped. Running across more mining parties in WHs because of an increased return on reward would be awesome. I get that you can "lock down" wormholes, but you still get incoming connections, and anyways, you can still do similar in nullsec where you bubblefuck your gates.  
---
Like someone else said, changing up the meta every once and awhile. Adding more content.. I mean, for the amount of people playing this game, I think there would be a little more added than is currently. It felt like a lot of the new content we did get was a flop, or poorly designed / executed, and then once pushed before it was ready, it was forgotten about. A LOT of these newer systems fall under that regard, especially stuff that actually adds gameplay. I don't mean structures/abyssal shit, just a lot of the other shit like drifter incursions, npc miners, strongholds, shit like that.  
---
Still love the game though and I honestly only quit because I couldn't find a solid group in WH space to play with. I'll probably come back at some point and setup my own group in some nullsec alliance as before.  
---
Although my previous corp was a bit of a flop, building something myself from the ground up felt amazing, and structuring it so that the corporation grew itself (infrastructure wise) and offered incentives to play in it / participate in things such as corp ops felt really good. Even if we were a small wormhole corp. I really do miss that aspect, and the same with how many people are willing to actually take a group out in this game compared to other PvP games, people aren't as attached because you don't need to rock expensive shit to succeed sometimes.
---
That's a solo activity you're going to have a hard time building a corp around that.
---
Look for abyssal traces, could be bots. If they're bots drop a mobile depot on all their spots where they have traces at (combat probes required). 
---
I like what no local would do for the meta of null sec.
---
why would i? i have everything i need in this alliance im in where 
---
streamlined content is created for the inept and uninvolved many. their name escapes me at the moment. something along the lines of grons or somesuch.
---
but isnt it easier to make isk in an established region with ihubs? why would anyone go there?
---
I think you're right that progression as a function of effort rather than time is an important concept in enabling leagur-based mechanics to work. But CCP is already trending that way, though, with things like grindable boosters and daily injectors. 
---
I think you're also discounting the fact that people who try to credit card their way to supers via massive skill and industry farms would probably would find themselves getting blobbed pretty hard. 
---
Fundamentally, scarcity is what made Eve great. There is no longer scarcity in Eve, and that's a big reason why Eve is dogshit in 2019. Nothing short of a server reset OR introduction of OP ships that use different mats will fix that.
---
None of what I'm saying will ever happen to Eve though, it's too risky and CCP 2019 is not gonna do anything that might reinvigorate life to they game they ruined.
---
Thanks for video
---
Never share your music tastes with the public ever again.
---
Not my video.
---
Gonna drop some dank fucking leaks (that were literally already leaked in Bliss's alliance update). The plan from the beginning was to turn Hakonen into a new hub is I guess the word for INIT. For as long as I've been in we've had multiple stagings that we switch between. Querious, Curse, Syndicate NPC Geminate and Fountain, and now Hakonen have at one point or another ships and jump clones leaving the option for nerds and fcs to seek content in various places. This has already been leaked in Bliss's alliance update that got posted to /r/eve. 
---
The fact that that information is already out there and you still managed to get basic facts wrong is fucking hilarious.
---
i mean.. no offense but maybe exploration gets a bit boring after 1year? on top of that, its not something you have to do together..
---
Because a lot of people spent a very long time training their characters, and now all the excruciating time it took to make them strong and useful is meaningless.
---
No, I'm simplifying his ridiculous argument. 
---
He is attacking two capital class ships in gunnery range of citadel, where there is clearly a cyno ship on grid, devoted to being outside the range of a cyno inhibitor for just this situation, with an interceptor.  
---
This is a situation that is clearly to the benefit of the defenders due their diligence in being prepared for just this kind of attack. 
---
When the fight plays out exactly how anyone would expect, the OP Is frustrated that the mechanics don't allow him an easier attack. IMHO, it should be no easy task to beat a defensive setup like this. 
---
It's like a bank robber being upset that the bank had bulletproof glass and a silent alarm that called the police, demanding that the police shouldn't come so quickly because it foiled his robbery plans.  
---
One can only dream of Mad Max'eque Player Owned Thunderdomes in Hi-Sec where veteran/newbie players duke it out in matches where onlookers bet their last Isk on their favourite gladiators. Then lose everything. Then they burn the thunderdome and collect the insurance money.
---
It's a tall ask, I will have to agree.
---
One thing the 64 bit may help with is client crashing.  If (as some report) the client is running OOM, and crashing due to that, that'll make the client more stable.
---
If the client is more stable, the tidi will be less bad because people won't be disconnecting and reconnecting.  Having to reconnect a large number of clients is probably not good for the server performance.
---
But yeah, it won't be a miracle cure.  It'll make it less bad.
---
I need a massive fucking war so I can sperg as much as possible with a voice changer and prose so purple you can taste grape in your mouth when you read it.
---
I've sort of realized I hate all PvE in EVE Online except maybe manufacturing a ton of Megathrons or something (but then I'd have to mine to truly make the big bucks and I hate mining more than anything). There would need to be a massive overhaul of the pve systems to pique my interest.
---
I think the massive years long war is more likely.
---
The meta has existed for so long because CCP was been too afraid to meaningfully nerf them due to how many people are credit carding/fully investing in rorqs.
---
When you say "first-hand" I take it to mean you are in the room with this guy?
---
I've always thought they should do away with local in null. It's supposed to be dangerous out there but in reality everyone just docks up when a neutral enters system.  
---
well someone needs to pay for the damage done to my eardrums 
---
Those that hate caps and love small fleets. Pretty much everyone. 
---
Lol how is this proof of anything? It's just a bunch of uncloaked ships. 
---
The way I usually setup my PI is to have extractors deliver to storage facility, from storage facility routes take the raw materials to basic factories, and the T1 products are delivered to the Launch Pad. This way I have a storage for both raw and T1 products.
---
What does Ramweezy think?
---
Does CODE ever take fights in null or WH space? 
---
As is your flair :)
---
Same thing you say when warping a fleet to their doom.
---
No denying that they suck, its just it was more fun back then (to me at least).
---
is it because i keep repeating myself? 
---
Save yourself the grief. You are not getting paid for this. It's not worth it. Relax. Have fun.
---
oops, hadn't even started yet. this remote is very silly!  
---
What are you talking about? He uses bombers because they can fit a covert cyno you absolute fucking mong
---
 is it because i keep repeating myself? 
---
My correctly set flair that I definitely did not forget about until just now?
---
Yup. But the bot owners fight to keep local every time. It’s already been shown that boys heavily rely on local to operate and without it, they die in masses.
---
goons really hate him for some reason
---
I wonder if they have any bombers left
---
The slowdown is real in mid-end game eu4. 
---
Imagine not understanding that input broadcasting is completely allowed for startup
---
That seems like a reach.  CCP has always been leery about fucking with the "endgame" ships, injector meta or not.
---
&gt;It's like a bank robber being upset that the bank had bulletproof glass and a silent alarm that called the police, demanding that the police shouldn't come so quickly because it foiled his robbery plans.
---
The important difference being that the real word is not designed with robber balance in mind lol
---
&gt;The reality is that most small gang players spend their time pvping - not krabbing - and each loss for them matters a hell of a lot more than your average player.  Further, the ships/pods required to fight on grid with fighters are greater a loss (and far more likely to be lost) than the capital ships usually fielded against them.  As a result, small gang players take far more risks than most.
---
I just want to co-sign this entire post.
---
And thanks for having time and patience to write this down dude.
---
And highlight one thing
---
I remember that not just me, but bunch of my friends would be purchasing plex and sinking it to ISK just to get ships for those small gang roams.
---
And what  I see coming from 0.0heads is some talk about snake implants and shit?!
---
FFS, most of the guys didn't had time to run any PvE to cover their losses from time to time.  
---
One side has more caps than the other caps + munnins combined, and it's still near 50-50 losses ?
---
oh right. sorry for being wrong- I thought you did a full deployment to Hak- and  fined 5B anyone caught ratting/mining in a super who was not deployed ( have I got anything wrong yet)- and as of yesterday  all INIT were told to go home to J5A ( is that also wrong) - INIT haven't won any meaningful fight in their "deployment"  ( is that wrong)  I stand to be corrected- but from this outside view you are " running for home" 
---
Wow your relationship really *is* cozy. 
---
Not that theres anything wrong with that.
---
A lot of posters are talking about the issue of one toon training to be sold on the market versus feeding multiple ones into a single character. 
---
But there's also the flip side of this equation: Let's say tomorrow CCP decides that missiles are underpowered and need a fix. So they tweak a whole bunch of stuff in the name of making the turret meta less dominant. The next result of this is that the average missile battleship/dreadnought/titan can overwhelm the opposition.
---
By the end of the week, every single character in a major alliance can have absolutely perfect skills for missiles and the ships that use them. Why would you ever fly anything else? Missiles are clearly the be-all and end-all of fighting. Use 'em or lose. Oh, your small group doesn't have the money to fund your members' instant reworking to fly the meta? Too bad.
---
It's wrong.
---
Well, obviously. If every attack you made was a suicide run you’d simply spend too much time reshipping in order to be effective. And people would put more effort into baiting you if you flew blingy, easy to catch ships 
---
Papa Bliss has been cranking them out with his bomber bpos and selling them to us for only 20% above jita in hakonen.
---
I'm not sure if I qualify as "bored shitless", but what I am currently missing in EVE is a goal to persue.
---
I used to spend hours upon hours conquering space, just to have somewhere to live and I was so determined to do so. I wanted to be part of the big-toy-club, so I farmed like a mad man to buy a pilot and a super. People told me to never aim for a titan, when I started the game - now I own one. I wanted to be completely self-sufficient, which is why I bought (nearly) every blueprint and maxed out its research, I have a small army of industry-characters and could mine my stuff if I wanted to.
---
But now I am out of stuff to do/aim for. I'm not interested in a faction-titan (I feel like buying the first one was a waste of isk, tbh) and have enough isk for most day-to-day stuff, but I just can't get myself to do stuff, just to generate isk. Whenever I attempt it, I have to basically force myself to keep going... every pve-activity feels so mind-numbingly unfun, that I can't justify doing it just for the sake of doing it. And without a reason to actually do it, there is nothing that would keep me going through that torture.

---
Is this you?
---
I've not played in a long time, but I always just did that when I did my weekly supply runs for ships/ammo/fuel/etc. A single Orca covered all my PI + loot going out, and could easily suffice on the way back in.
---
Blue loot has functionally zero volume, and most loot of value from WH fights are green/blue/purple mods, unless things have changed a lot I'd be surprised you have *that* much in loot.
---
Probs wants them to stay together because he likes it up the arse.
---
Someone should write a bot that takes new accounts and welps them into known botting areas so they constantly warp back to their safes and can’t make any profit.
---
Insert 2 dollars to start the spin cycle. The above statement will be rendered meaningless and/or become a win for your side
---
A few.
---
That's a good point on server load from processing disconnects/reconnects.
---
PVP gameplay that encourages diverse fleet setups.
---
For a 500 player fleet 10 supers, 50 battleships, 200 cruisers, 150 frigs and destroyers, add specialized ships like bombers, logi, ammo resupply according to taste. And of course, the objectives to match.
---
No "death by a thousand +10%" bullshit. Ammo, skills, tech, drugs, ship boni create a difference of 200-300% power in the same weight class.
---
Meaningful would only happen based on a different economy or different cosmetic rewards though.
---
He asked if he was wrong. It's pretty black or white. I mean, you can spin it however you want?
---
They are afking the static complexes, its where the Akemon 1008 amour implant can be farmed. I believe there is a Russian guy running it everyday as the item needed drops only 2 times a day. Broken mechanic of course.
---
Can we ever forgive them for losing both their keepstars and dropping the largest lootspawn in EVE's history?
---
Well, it's a struggle. But Christ shows us the way.
---
Did you read the words jump clones and multiple stagings? It means if something comes up in fountain or CR we go there (take a look at dotlan for cloud ring) and jump clone to hak for fleets there, or vice versa. It was directly stated that it was "real deployment" for a week or two lol.
---
A few things ruined eve for me.
---
1 Tranquility is becoming serenity. The biggest issue is how we CCP herded us into the bad setup that the playerbase is in. What I mean by this is injectors, rorqs, and a few other things have people in mass going to a handful of alliances so they can safely afk rorq mine on moon goo. So this game is going to turn into serenity. Meaningful pvp aside from very small gang will die because the game is turning into imperium and test vs everyone else, and news flash everyone else loses that fight because currently everyone else is infighting because thats all they can do. A token example of this would be when skillu dumpstered all those tri supers and titans. Tactically this hurts skillu because one day those tri titans were gonna come in real handy, however skillu needs content now and tri is content now. Skillu cannot dumpster a test super move op, or an nc. Super move op, etc etc so shooting tri made sense in the moment. Meanwhile goons and test are building more and more titans by the day. This crisis could have been avoided from the get go around ualx if tri, pl, nc, skillu, horde, and gotg all got their shit together and got a plan and decided to go for an all out war on goons and test, but that ship has sailed. Eventually nc, pl, skillu, etc are going to be dumpstered and the whole map will be imperial legacy. So eve is on a timer, 2 years, 3 years, something like that and were going to have serenity 2.0
---
2 CCP its self. the removal of the community team basically said that ccp doesnt care, and we have seen the results. Where was that ship and mods balance dedicated team we were promised? Where are those tweaks to fozzie sov to "make contesting sov more fun" that fozzie personally promised after the debacle that fozzie sov became. Why do we have to burn down reddit to get even the slightest balance change from ccp? 
---
3 Is PA. When pa bought ccp, they made it very clear they pretty much just wanted the ip. So for us thats good right? That means they will let ccp continue to run eve and they will stay out of it? No not really, because PA can allocate money now, so since pa just wanted the ip, they are not going to allocate much money to eve. They are going to spend money on whatever they are going to do with the ip which might be awesome in the future when we get new eve universe games, but it does not help eve in the moment. 
---
Just a list of top of the head annoyances that have built up over the years.
---
Fw still not fixed
---
Where are those shield slaves at?
---
Lack of more wh specific effects so that cco does not have to rebalance ships just because wormholes. Like of faxes are op in whs, put a wh effect on all j space that nerfs fax rep for example. Insteal ccp has to revalance shit just cause of 1% of the player base.
---
Lack of attention to wormholes in general, i love you wh bros, dont think from the last post I dont appreciate you.
---
I could go on but why l.
---
Tl:dr injectors and rorqs are going to turn eve into serenity 2.0 
---
Ccp cant be trusted on even the most basic of things.
---
The br doesn't do a good job of portraying the fight. We waited the initial carrier drop, and they baited our Dread drop. We dropped dreads at 0 on the carriers (really we warped them in) and they counterdropped brawl dreads at 0. Not sure if they were waiting to see if we brought supers or they needed more time to organize, but we traded very well with their initial Dread drop until they dropped LR dreads. 
---
The BR would make you think those ships we're all on field at the same time, but really it was a few brawl dreads, carriers, and faxes, then a lot of LR dreads and a couple supers after we worked through a lot of their initial dreads
---
Give me a thriving 15-30 man gang T1 Cruiser scene in LowSec again.
---
Remove industrial core. Improve mining boosts to be on par with sieged mode. Remove panic. Remove drones. Give them 4 slots for strip miners. Same mining power, no panic, no ultra tank from going into siege mode for bonus.
---
What about fort knocks?
---
I disagree, the point of a corp is to group like minded people.
---
Having a focus is better than most other corps who start out.
---
For an exploration corp:
---
- Pick a number of staging areas and set up corp hangers with ships and supplies.
---
- Organise corp loot hauling or offer a buyback at set locations
---
- Set up small prizes for most sites hacked, moist expensive loot, etc. (exploration upgrades line Sisters Launchers or probes or something)
---
Don't be hyper active, just help provide focus and try help smooth things out for others in the corps.
---
You've got a good idea, think about how your game could be made easier then strive to do that for the corporation!
---
OP, you're thicker than the armour plates on my Nyx.
---
And that's pretty fuckin' thick
---
Old character bazaar and injectors have nothing even remotely in common. For what its worth, character being sold had to be trained up by someone ... meaningfuly, to be able to do certain things, the slow and hard way. Thing like injector should "help" player, not bypass the effort and basically gameplay. As soon as something like injectors pop up you can expect hijacked economy and fucked up gameplay, whats precisely what we have atm.
---
I am all for injectors, for omega lets say once a year 1-1.5mil batch inject (2-3 injectors). As for injectors for Alphas? Alphas should get preciselly what they deserve, big shit or removal from game all of i give two shits.
---
The repeaped "fact that you are able to fly a ship, doesnt mean you fly it correctly" lost its meaning. You dont have to have a degree in particle physics to fly a Rorq, even fuckin titan. With injectors EVE turned into Pay2Win, like it or not.
---
It simply like CCP selling skill point for cash: Tons of skill farming toons buying plex to train skill and use extractors where come from aur(cash). and people buy tons of rorqual pliots to mine and you get 12b for a super right now and ratting and invest more to skill farm and go on and on.  
---
HOW IS THIS GOOD FOR THE GAME
---
Never happen unfortunately, the big alliances make too much money from the bots.
---
I know but when hidden you can't see overheating of those modules
---
I'm not sick lol. I'm away on work. :/
---
Lots of different things tbh, all the systems in eve look good on the surface and have nothing below it:
---
 * the market is limited by order limits
---
 * industry is limited by it not actually being fun to make anything or set things up
---
 * pvp by gate camping and pay to win and the old n+1 and size &gt; everything problem
---
 * there is nothing to explore, because the map is already revealed and routes get just *calculated* and when you do map a wormhole chain, it's super awkward and you have to use external tools.
---
 * social features are severely limited, no voting, no corp payout, eve's guilds are dictatorships, all of them, no exceptions, because the logistics behind differently structured societies is missing
---
You sure? You're always sneezing on comms
---
[This](https://evedarklord.blogspot.com/2016/01/move-ball.html) 
---
I believe they did release some additional ones once or twice, but I might be wrong.
---
A rebalance to combat the proliferation of supers, not holding my breath. 
---
[Same](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75488561/)

Thanks for taking the bait for us &lt;3 
---
geckos are bad investment now
---
We have been told to move back for one op, to absolutely not set our deathclones to j5a but to leave it in hakonen. 
---
I understand that deployments are foreign to gotg being that your only deployment has been to the dumpster, but sometimes you have to take care of things at home. That doesn’t mean the deployment is over 
---
That’s the beauty of eve: as in real life, there’s little certainty. 
---
Someone *always* brings a drake...
---
Achoooo!
---
That's not pay-2-win, mate. More like: pay-2-fly-ships-I-have-no-business-flying.
---
It doesn't matter how big and blingy a ship you pay your way into, if you don't know how to fly it you'll die just as quickly as if you were flying any other ship.
---
What do you consider as having strategic value? Because, honestly, there's nothing in the game that can't be easily replaced these days. 
---
&gt; and Catch in general, we won't drop caps on you
---
only if you can win easily, seen cap drops in solo battleships there do many times its not even funny
---
The same usage of there/they're... pick one. (Hint: One of them is correct, one is not.)
---
they've been re-released since then as part of an event. same with genos, same with leopards
---
still technically a limited supply but it's shown that ccp is willing to increase that supply by unlimited numbers, so you can't really rely on them holding their value as you can with, say, AT ships or faction forts 
---
*Sic transit gloria mundi*
---
We've served our time as the underdogs. We get to enjoy the fruits of victory for once.
---
You're welcome, you came out swinging tho :) props for flying logi, first to get killed and harder to whore on killmails
---
capital mods and cap charges are the vast majority of the volume 
---
&gt;  did nothing but small gang
---
&gt;  got over 1,000 kills in the Brave standing fleet
---
gotta choose one
---
pretty much this. there is no reason to fight over sov space anymore. it takes so much time and grinding to clear structure spam, and you dont need the space anyway. IHUBS make a single system worth 20 without one. add in the skill-trading and plexing and its just a garbage grindy game you have to spend significant money on to enjoy, and even then it has no real affect on the masses of assets people and alliances have amassed. what is the point? bragging rights was cool for a while but now that anyone can drop some cash and do anything they see on stream or in youtube, its pretty pointless
---
yes
---
So its going well for you? as the aggressor, so well that you have to jump clone  to defend your space leaving your FOB? that's not a scenario that in any way looks good, and invader should be proactive,-  looks from here on the outside you switched to being reactive- 
---
I understand that. It is not allowed to be in space chatting with it though.
---
Ah, fair. I was living the low class WH life, so other than our token dread and carrier, we didn't have to deal with cap parts. I imagine if you're in a C5 that's a very different story, but then JFs are available to you as well.
---
I mean if Carneros *really* wanted to burn off fat, he could move Bastion to Curse...
---
That would be great!
---
Input broadcasting isnt botting
---
And they drop caps because they’re bokenly OP against subs. 
---
Nerf caps to be unusable against anything smaller than a battleship and that won’t happen. 
---
Not to mention if fax’s reps were based on sig that would make this game less shit too. 
---
Even as someone who used to exclusively do small gang stuff, I don’t blame players for doing the GTFO approach. We’ll always try to do the most optimal path to success. 
---
CCP is just too incompetent to properly balance their game. 
---
The year is still young friend
---
You gotta put more faith in combat rorquals.
---
What is everyone's favorite ship/fit for null sec exploration. What hulls are good, what hulls should be avoided
---
One can only dream of Mad Max'eque Player Owned Thunderdomes in Hi-Sec where veteran/newbie players duke it out in matches where onlookers bet their last Isk on their favourite gladiators. Then lose everything. Then they burn the thunderdome and collect the insurance money. It's a tall ask, I will have to agree.
---
get some hyper active core member and build your corp around them. If one is burning out, respectfully replace him, so as soon as he's fit again, he'll support the corp again. 
---
Yes please. If blops are the best option available, we are on the right track.
---
If you can afford them, hookbills are great. Double web/rocket/scram fit will easily kill any brawling ship. Or you can fit TD in the mids and kill scramkite comets, if you think you’re about to fight one of those. 
---
Kestrels are good if you want to save money, sutonia has a few videos of him doing really well in one with an alpha alt
---
Cyno spool up would hurt hunters a lot more then help. You ever lit a cyno next to a carrier in a ship fast enough to catch a carrier?  Panic and cynos being mutually exclusive to activate would help alot. 
---
I think at this point we have to accept ccp horribly misread or listened to the wrong people when it comes to citadels. They were meant to be a replacement to pos, allow you to do everything a pos would. What they gave us is ill thought out and far more powerful then a pos.  Small structures could of been so good as content creators. Instead they are anchored 200km off a keepstar so no "hey let's see if they form when we shoot this structure" its let's go home and play a different game.
---
Just because they can be found there, does not equate to it being wise to attack them there.
---
I like the smaller scale, small gang pvp. Haven't let Eve yet.... What if they add systems with gate restrictions by ship size. Like FW gates or wormholes but the whole system is limited to a certain ship size so it can't escalate into one side being totally dumped on other than being out numbered. I'm sure this concept has been thrown around already,  I just haven't seen it. 
---
I'd say friendship and reputation cannot but easily replaced, but skill injectors fucked that one up too.
---
Yes restricting cap usage is needed. Just not by SP gate. 
---
Increase the hull cost and nuke capital insurance.
---
wouldn't it just be easier to have a button that says "my client is fucked somehow please send everything once so I can match you again"? 
---
plenty of times EVE has weird ass lag and modules randomly fail to activate.
---
I like how all the people calling you out for lack of everything have for the most part a single downvote.
---
Or just reduce damages to subcaps
---
LOL, good point. 
---
Goons use capital umbrella because they’re afraid of loss
---
It's saying something when my immediate reaction is to assume that CCP would be more keen on banning people who write up bots to counter these Gilabots long before they ever take action on banning the Gilabots themselves.
---
"could a small gang deal with caps by not being a small gang anymore?"
---
he has a simple trick:
---
be in local 
---
 Quit before you get to regret your choice
---
And from a perspective of someone who can read or has any experience with init its literally what the plan was all along. Again referencing bliss's post, Hak is a tilde tilde tilde harassment ~ ~ ~ thing, troll entosis hunting krabs and dread bombing if some retard fucks up, just like we did from npc geminate for a couple of months. Trust me not even Brisc believes in int enough to think we're going to accomplish more than being annoying and killing krabs while getting fights with what we've been doing. 
---
so sorry, since 2008, eve has been pay2win.   
---
Also,what exactly is pay2win if being able to buy upgrades and characters doesn't count for pay2win?  
---
One of 3 things (not all at once per se):
---
1. Completely overhaul of how big alliances work.... it’s just too safe, too easy, too efficient. If you join the goons or pandemic, there’s really no danger anymore unless you’re an idiot. 
---
I know this would be unpopular to most vets, but imagine if they just dissolved alliances tomorrow at downtime. It would create such a shitstorm and it would be amazing 
---
2. Completely change the gameplay - just feels stale now, like that meme YouTube video about how awesome Eve is and it’s just a miner shooting an asteroid ..  this actually feels legit now to me
---
3. Just increase the danger somehow - make it riskier for everything! 
---
Well, its the only game I keep coming back to. The people I interact with are fantastic, the game is just a medium for that interaction to take place in. 
---
This wouldnt be happening if Ramweezy was in charge.
---
It’s not a small gang, it’s bait. And that seems almost as fun
---
the assumption he's broadcasting is literally based on "he made a mistake and didn't cloak some of his campers"
---
this is literally a witch hunt thread
---
Nah, fuck that, give us easy feeds we can clean up with blobs of Titans so we can get back to krabbing sooner.
---
-EVE, 2019
---
Anyone who tries this kind of "sportsmanship" style of play will get shit on by others who will do anything and everything to gain an advantage. While the fantasy sounds nice, I doubt any group will ever intentionally play less than optimally just for the sake of keeping content around.
---
Literally every time he has told Nikolai Mazinkov, chairman of RvB, amd myself that he would give us our medals. He said he would do so at least twice to Nik's face, yet here we are literal years later and RvB still do not have AT XIV medals.
---
Bring back drone carriers, fighters are dumb
---
OK so... I did watch a few minutes of footage from the test, and it looked rough... but so does the 32-bit client anyway
---
Just because the client will still lag though doesn't mean this is a worthless pursuit. EVE absolutely needed 64-bit. Many games arguably do not, but EVE, due to the scale of the simulation and the real time nature, absolutely does
---
RAM consumption is a counter-weight to CPU consumption. The more RAM you have and the more things you can reliably store in RAM, the faster your application will become (if designed to), because the CPU can get to information faster in your RAM than it can on your harddrive
---
With the new breathing room, it should enable CCP to iterate on the client for YEARS to come, constantly squeezing out new performance gains
---
EVE 32-bit was at it's peak, there was no blood to draw from that stone.
---
Frankly, if the 64-bit test went off without any crashes, then that in itself is a miracle for the first public test of a new client on a new architecture EVER
---
That's basically what the disconnect/reconnect button is.
---
Far worse than this is the insane tankiness of rorqs.  They may as well be floating keepstars that mine stuff.  Last week, we had a 50 ship fleet with about 25 bombers and had downed several carriers and came across a rorque.  For 40 whole minutes we bombed him w/ focus voids and had 4 or 5 sentinels on grid and kept the cyno inhib repped and kept the glass jaw bombers and tackle repped.  His supply of cap batteries were more than our ammo.  They finally gated in a super fleet to save the rorq just after our calls for ammo carriers arrived.  
---
So, not only do you have to keep a cyno inhib alive you have to organize ammo re-inforcements before the defenders can organize a defense.  Granted, if we had 40 bombers if wouldn't have mattered, but if you have a lot of ships who are explicitly designed to take down caps and still can't break a cap in 40 minutes, something is broken.
---
Making a mistake is not the same as input broadcasting to gain an unfair advantage in gameplay. I'd also love to hear you explain how input broadcasting helps a cloaky camper camp more effectively. 
---
I wish you could too babe, I wish you could too
---
Yeah, just gotta worry about the years worth of seeded Ravens. Really gets your noggin twirlin' [points to head].jpg
---
Ok, globby, you have been around for some time now - I would expect you to have learned at this point: No, we don’t hate him, nor are we ~REEE TRIGGURRED REE~. Him / her / sexual identity and Olmeca, in their infinite autism and spergyness, has challenged goons and their affiliated autisms and spergyness and raised the bar by megaphoning it on le reddits during a time of which literally nothing of importance is happening. So you know *what does happen?*. Globby, do you know? I know you know. It’s more autism and sperg in the form of le reddit shitposting. Until something happens in EVE or Olmeca joins mar5hy in the ban wagon for continued vote brigading / mid harassment expect more to come. Till then sit down, shut the fuck up, and continue being an irrelevant armchair shitposter.
---
tranquility is simply too saturated. everything ounce of efficiency has been squeezed out of the game to a point where isk and minerals have been amassed far too much. this means pvp is pointless. expanding your sov is pointless. i blame capital ratting, IHUBS, and mining being so passive you can do it with 30+ characters at once, like seriously wtf is that crap?
---
if you disable all mining equipment in the game, how long would the current supply of ships and minerals last? destroying and enemy fleet means very little anymore.
---
remove capital ratting, passive mining and infrastructure hubs.  restrict ore types to more than just security rating, but regional aswell. having everything you could possible need in one solar system is garbage no matter how you look at it.
---
Been all over delve and fountain, I never see the BS that keeps getting spewed about bots from imperium. I do however see bots from other folks coming through all the time. 
---
You are going to hate me, but make an instanced pvp zone out of the abyssal sites. Have people drop filaments to queue up. Going in is a guaranteed loss-mail and pod unless you win to prevent people abusing it. The game needs instant-guaranteed pvp. Unless you are close with your alliance, waiting hours for fights gets old for everyone. Maybe even make it an event which goes away if it fails or causes collateral dmg.
---
If the bloc alliances leave and goons themselves start to split, it would be very easy for things to change.
---
Pay2win is something that gives you an  advantage that is inaccessible to players that don't pay. In EVE that's not true. No ship or module in EVE can not be used by regular players; none of them are exclusive to those that pay for them.
---
At the end of the day you may well be facing other players on the battlefield that flying just as blingy shit you bought with your PLEX, except they payed for theirs by grinding for it in-game.
---
PLEX simply allows you to skip a lot of in-game grinding.
---
*pops too on BOTtle of beer
---
Hey the russians are trying it to, maybe we're onto something. (or maybe with horde in the are and nc. and pl having nerds who enjoy small gang and gate camping its super cheap content).
---
tldr
---
I really enjoy the comments on your videos, I don't know why. I think because there's bits of you as a person in there so it's not just another PVP video, and your beliefs are very admirable.
---
Ohhhh the realities we create inside the kingdoms of our minds.
---
Well, theres drones for that :D  
---
And sorry, had my snarky day i suppose lol.
---
remove local
---
How is 3500 toons small?
---
The 100km range is dumb in these days of no longer playing on 500km grids. They should inhib from much further away than that.
---
You also shouldn't be allowed to light a cyno at 0 on a structure. There is no counterplay to that, even with the tethering delay.
---
And then of course there's the well known other problems with inhibs - their long anchoring time giving the target the chance to cyno up after being ganked, the fact that even when they come online they don't inhibit the cyno lit right next to them, and their health pool structure making them impossible to keep alive under pressure.
---
If you want to explore and kill other explorers you come across then an astero. 
---
For better bonuses but no defence or combat abilities at all a cov ops frigate. 
---
Now and then you’ll see a t3 cruiser because they do have a subsystem for exploration bonuses and can refit on the fly. Significant difference in expense and SP required for that though. 
---
It’s nice to see they’re wisely spending their resources to make the game better. 
---
Oh no 100 titans aren't right there to save me so I can krab to my heart's content forever. Also, assuming you're not name baiting, you should actually read the thread instead of just listening to what you hear from reddit of all fucking things rofl.
---
Ballsy, and a good sport about it. Respect man!
---
His entire r/eve behavior formula is like:
---
Goons: olmeca grrr
---
Not goons: olmeca chill
---
I left the game after the cap changes with jump fatigue. I was playing in BL at the time and couldn't always make move ops due to work schedules. When I realized that I would have days of jump fatigue if I were to solo move my ships unsubbed all of my accounts.
---
I don't think anything could make me come back.
---
If you and 5 of your friends want to shoot things, it'd be kind of hard to drag 50 bombers along.
---
Creation of meningful pvp requires a shift in how to generate isk from grinding pve content in peace to fighting over stuff in space. 
---
We need more reasons to fleet up and go out into space where we when will clash with other fleets. 
---
Unassailable until you jam 2,000 ravens and a 15k word essay masturbating to this high APM boosh-play on r/eve
---
Nice... NICE....reeeeeeeeal nice.
---
SHUT THE FUCK UP JARRY
---
yeah but less people are playing so there are more to go round
---
Ccp hired 2 former EA employees. I'm sure we dont need to say anything for then to be thinking about how to cash in.
---
If I could downvote this any harder I would
---
Well, the ability to do that is also retarded.
---
Initialism 
---
Neat to see how much things have changed since then. I remember wondering what you were doing there when our gang went past your dread in provi the a few days back, but nowadays the capabilities of haw dreads are well known enough that we declined to engage, so I didn't get to find out at the time. \&gt;.\&gt; Good to see you've rediscovered what you like in eve.
---
Honestly depends on your definition of a bot. It's essentially a script that automates a process. The only difference is one operates independently and one operates dependently
---
&gt; I think there's a good case to be made that making it that large is OP
---
How in the world would that be OP? The whole point of an inhib is to inhibit cynos on the grid - making people cyno off grid would be balanced, never mind only 1000km away.
---
It had 111 kill marks on it. 
---
To hijack this, I think the problem is not as much that an attacker has to come back to kill the structure, it's rather that there's 456235435365646 structures in the system or around the attacker has to come back for, often in different times. I didn't see much people complaining specifically about having to come twice to shoot POSes or even stations during dominion sov.
---
So maybe if there is an artificial limit in how many actual citadels you can put into a system, or a constellation etc, that might help a bit.
---
Because bots aren't as obvious until they warp out the second a neutral enters local and orbit a control tower or upwell sturcture with 10 vni's at the same time. 
---
the 64 bit client is gona put an end to the people running stupid amounts of clients, either that or force them to install insane amounts of memory

Tip: Bots often dont give a shit about ESS' in system :D  [https://i.imgur.com/NKZN0za.png](https://i.imgur.com/NKZN0za.png)
---
people like these are the reason plex prices are high, 200 accounts = 100k plex a month
---
the ones on the route to jita get poped alot
---
Yeah so this is why an inhib should also shut down existing cynos in its range.
---
I ratted a little, mined a little, traded a lot (jita to delve mostly) and did a lot of T2 manufacturing. Now I have two titan alts (90bn cost to inject, each) and two fax alts (65bn to inject, each), and two fit titans (55bn each, in delve), many faxes, dreads and misc subcaps, and some liquid isk to boot. 
---
Reactions (making moon goo into stuff like ferrogel and sylramic fibers) is a nice earner on top of mining/ratting/exploration/etc. Same with manufacturing. Because you get a percentage extra every time you cycle the isk. You have maybe 5bn to invest, get 5.5bn+ back when you sell your resulting product, then you have 5.5bn+ to invest (plus whatever you made mining/ratting/explo/etc), then you get 6.1bn+ back, and then as the weeks go by you suddenly end up with 250bn+. Especially if your subcap alt is as efficient as mine. I only fly logistics, so my subcap alt only needs about 14M SP to be "complete", the rest is extracted every month and sold, same goes with my completed FAX and titan alts, manufacturing alts, trade alts, etc. 
---
You could be wealthy if you just set your "working goal" low and work towards your overall goal slowly but surely. The working goal of mine was to have a fax alt I could contribute with, while I only flew logistics with my subcap alt. So when I had a subcap alt and fax alt, everything I made on top of that was isk I could invest in trade and manufacturing towards earning my overall goal of owning a titan. 
---
Some days I did onlu 50M of profit with trade  (just updating a couple orders before work, not all my 60 orders or so) or even just some salvaging for the change of pace, other days I did 15bn profit by selling 60bn worth of product I made for 45bn. 
---
You'd be amazed how quickly you reach your goals if you just like the people you talk to day to day, and if you just do a little bit of earning while talking to them. 
---
Ty
---
Both sides came out pretty much the same as they went in.
---
Lol. Yeah, much better in wormholes. Get off the kool-aid.
---
OBSESSED
---
And this is another problem. If there is no scarcity, there's no reason to fight for anything.
---
(Talking about nullsec, i.e. "building nations" game, not lowsec, i.e. "casual PVP" game )
---
This took longer than I thought 
---
Any fight that ends up 50-50 is a good fight.
---
GF BL plz come visit us every once in awhile o7
---
Yup
---
Init cant even keep a POS reinforced in hakonen...
---
This is true and not true. The value lays in skill in eve. Among other things like reputation and so forth.
---
You can pay 2 win. Max a day 1 toon out on sp... and have a half tril left over... or virtually limitless isk... 
---
But if you it doesnt matter if you undock a frigate, or a titan, if the pilot does not know the mechanics, the core values of what is happening when flying said ships; than frankly ot doesnt matter.
---
Yes old eve is dead. You can now pay to get your way forward in sp, eves experience -.
---
You could buy plex and that was just isk. Sp... that's time you're buying. 
---
Overall: eve is p2w. But an a pilot who cant fly means jack.
---
All the hype vids, and the posts on reddit about an Init deployment, and nothing news worthy. Fuck me, that's disappointing.
---
DUST514 except with proper integration and Destiny 1 gunplay.
---
I stroke it to the Rorqual, which I love the best. 
---
I be strokin. 
---
&gt;  If pressing F1 bores you, get into one of the specialist roles. Then your decisions matter even in big fights. Being an F1 monkey should be the gateway drug to getting to specialist and FC roles where the real skill and fun is.
---
THIS.
---
Downvoted as requested, didn't even read the comment.
---
a time machine probably
---
You may be right.  But is it against EULA?
---
A brain so smooth it can’t even spell queue correctly. 
---
Remember to breath from your nose, friend. 
---
I just unsubbed in fact.
---
A fair bit of my reason was in fact that I feel like Im not happy with my life, needed to curb some spending, and work on leveling up my IRL status instead of more time on space pixels to distract myself.
---
That said, I also think the direction of CCP and EVE are terminal at this point and I don't see that improving either while it collectively stagnates into Unassailable Rich Nullbears Online while daddy PA just milk that group for all their worth until EVEs servers are shut down. I think I would have unsubbed regardless, as skill injectors and such have basically sucked out any notions of *earned* progression. 
---
Another thing i finally decided bothers me a lot is *I fucking hate the grind* as well as maintaining an army of alts to do it. Since it is either grind or use my bank account, I am choosing neither. 
---
Since I've known EVE to be a "never say never" thing for me I didn't biomass or give away my stuff, but more than anytime before I feel I may not be back. 
---
I know I'm going to sound like a total noob/snowflake here, but structure mechanics need to be sorted out. Left the game after I spent 3+ months mining in a Rorq, a whole month with production line filled with cap parts, then another month waiting for a Hel to pop out. 
---
Sold it, bought my first JF and was baited on a "freeport" that I had known people at. They had let me dock multiple toons there, knew the guys and flew with them for a few weeks leading up to building this JF route. Second I jumped my brand new shiny freighter in, I was denied docking access and a bunch of capitals cyno'd in of course. 
---
I understand the freedom of the game, the piracy, the betrayal of trust, I get it all and love it. But I played for 7+ years leading up to this event, kept up with all the updates, and figured I knew a fair amount about the game. Had no idea people could change my docking roles in an actual instant like that. 
---
I understand all that happened due to my own ignorance, but not receiving at least an EveMail stating my docking rights had changed, anything of the sort, was disheartening. 
---
Much appreciated. 
---
For a second I thought CCP was getting a new CEO. Sadly, nope.
---
Fair point
---
&gt; There is no longer scarcity in Eve, and that's a big reason why Eve is dogshit in 2019
---
Exactly. 
---
Soooooo 300+ FAXs in every engagement?
---
The currently top comment talks about the lack a market. What it proposes would just create a more complicated market, in which some people could practice their market skills to predict what skills people need etc. When it is minmaxed it would hit to an equilibrium, where 500m SP of Rorqual is still the same as 500m SP of stealth bomber.
---
I think people are angry at injectors but they don't know what exactly they are angry at. It's not the market. It's the immense boom of overall SP in the game, due to farm by farmer accounts. Previously you needed to grow an entire Rorqual account before flipping it. It took months of investment in PLEX, and selling it was way trickier. That business was not that accessible. Now lots of people have farmer accounts, all it takes is the initial plex. 1 month later you get back your investment plus cash (well, this changed a bit since people rely on MCTs now, but it was the case at the initial stages of SP farming). Even people (like me) who has lots of accounts for other purposes sell SP to keep maintenance costs low. So a way more immense number of SP is grown in the game. People purchase that via ISK generated out of thin air, and CCP gets rich. Meanwhile that SP converts into imbalanced levels of capital usage, and feeds into ecosystem problems such as the capital proliferation. The proliferation then causes more ecosystem problems, such as overmining and overfarming, which causes capitals to get even more cheaper and PLEX to inflate.
---
So injectors are just an element of the downward spiral this game is in that is constituted by other elements as well. It makes money to CCP, so I am not necessarily against it. I think if we addressed proliferation problems and ecosystem problems in other ways (making capitals less OP, making farming more risky), injectors themselves would stop being seen as a problem.
---
Anyone's a pvp corp if you're a solo dude ratting. And normally you wouldn't fully scan an entire chain while daytripping before thinking about ratting.
---
(Also why did my post above get downvoted? o.O)
---
Have you tried the abyssal sites by any chance? They have tried to make some different pve using the new ai
---
I wont change the name if you wont change the game

Can confirm.
---
people still don't like loosing things

Weapons grade autism is what killed that thing

Unironically this.

So youre saying ones a bot and one isnt? Got it.

---
Also top kills TEST last two months. And before you say it, it's not using a burst jammer. These is all hanging out and tackling in Brave standing fleet. Catch is full of small gang content and always will be. 
---
so is saying the n word in local? doesnt make foul-mouthed people bots.
---
Even most of lowsec is an emtpy shithole for my TZ
---
None of them being EVE.
---
I think the implementation of ultra safety Citadels added to it as well.
---
You should be doing the dishes though. 
---
This circlejerk has gotten so stale that people don't even pretend they're not repeating the same exact words that someone else has said.
---
Citadel timers stuck the farts out of a dead man's ass. Whatever fucking retard decided it should take a god damned week to kill one of these is an asshole with no business work on a game.
---
Doesn't help that most small gang involve long range kiting and nano games, or jams. Garmurs, Worms etc. 
---
I had to laugh a week ago when I noticed how dirt ass cheap t1 hulls had become. The hot flow of mineral from Rorqs Online have irreparably fucked up EVEs entire economy. 
---
Worth remembering brisc isn't fc. Just a glorified line member, and not a good one 
---
&gt;why do you guys hate skill injectors so much?
---
You’ll notice that almost every response to that questions is going to refer to being able to inject into X super quickly. More often then not, they’ll use titans, supers, and Rorqual alts as examples.
---
Imo, it’s not really injectors that cause the biggest pain. It is the broken or unbalanced ships in which they allow greater access to. If supers/titans weren’t the boogie men we see them as, and rorquals weren’t such broken resource creators, then it would simply be the next most painful point or broken ship in the game. And it will always be that forefront broken mechanic that will be the pain point. 
---
Personally, I don’t mind the idea that much. I’ve always disliked some of the massive wait times to use certain features of the game like that. There’s more detail my dislike, but it’s mostly the long stuff I won’t get into.
---
I’m very new to the game. What is making you addicted? I love the game so far (30 hours played or so) but I have no idea what’s going on in this picture and would like to know. 
---
You'd lose more players that way due to having to start from scratch. Myself included. Spent 3 years training up everything, not starting that shit again.
---
That's probably because if they used brawly ships they would get blobbed to death.
---
oh bless his littlle heart, we all know that the end game is entoitising, (just remind me how many of these  entosising Ops have actualy resulted in a capture?  that would be NONE?)  you cannt even form a fleet tonight  to roam from Hak, (stood down because not enough numbers) will let you post the stand down ping 
---
&gt; EG: Domi or even a fucking myrm can chase off pretty much any frigate.
---
... except the drones (even Warriors) aren't as fast as fighters and are far weaker so you can shoot them down. I think they even have worse tracking. The drone DPS using light drones with a ship like that is pathetic, too.
---
A garmur or similar can hold a domi in point indefinitely. Unlike a carrier which will just meme you with fighters.
---
Brave standing fleet is small gang. It's usually no more than 50 dudes running around GE- and V-3 &gt;&gt; Hed pipe killing nerds who come to Catch; and half of them are afk. It's not an 'organized' FC hardcore fleet. It's guys flying whatever they want to kill gangs. Goons come in several times a day with small gangs. I consider anything 20- or less a small gang. 
---
Because he doesn't just cloaky camp.
---
You are a fool if you think he had that turned on for any legitimate reason.
---
this game lived when the creator was still engaged and loved it.  this game died when they stopped loving the game and became more focused on their own lives, which in essence meant they stopped listening to the fans.  the final nail came when they sold their IP up the river for mutton and glue, like a lame work horse
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5grxiq/comment/dauz9o3
---
tiny said it best 
---
The point is the invaded group should have to counter with a similarish comp, not just drop a cap blob instantly on every T1 frigate that enters their space.
---
That isn't good gameplay, that's just letting old cap pilots be fucking aids to the point small gang shit just vanishes because why they hell would anyone bother at all. 
---
This sounds familiar
---
Jump drive mechanics that weren't `teleport to content` buttons.
---
oh wow, nerf capitals, weird
---
That's actually the problem: there is no strategic value in any real sense. Sure you have staging Forti's, but come on. 
---
What Eve really needs is more risk to Sov holders, less space for Rorquals, and less isk faucets. Make PvE something like wide spread Incursion areas that come and go based on activity.
---
That aside, asset safety needs to disappear, at least from null, completely. That will make structures housing precious Titan BPO's and Capital components prime targets and have serious strategic value for both defender and offender. Make Athanors and Sotiyos the first targets of major campaigns, not the afk Rorqual multiboxer in whatever pocket. Structures ought to be the content driver that force undocks.
---
Sov should come and go between many different entities, not 3-4  really strong ones. "Empire building" is fun for the Emperor and his immediate subordinates, but as you go further down the totem pole I'm sure you'll find most players are really bored shitless, especially the line member bitter vets. There's nothing to do besides grind and wait for a fleet, and repeat. We have brains and sometimes we like using them.
---
Ok, so what is he using it for?
---
Its really funny because there hasn't been a stand down ping, but there has been a ping in j5a (almost like its a split deployment).
---
lol just adapt
---
Ironic that people in the big blocs complain about lack of content.... Form your own group, poke the bear.
---
Cause you'd know what good ones are lmfao.
---
the what 
---
Why the actual fuck would you be mad that plex prices are soaring? 
---
A casual PvE server
---
I see you called in your little downvote brigade because you cant fight your own battles. Clearly not only is your little club of losers dying but your illiterate and don't know how to read. Re read what I said. But hey im also not ashamed for the fake post i helped you guys make. the 3b isk was so worth it.
---
Don’t think after 2 years away I’d come back. I spent about 8 years on the game tried every aspect but just genuinely got bored. The game had a chapter of my life and I look back at the time spent and what I could’ve done. 
---
For me personally citadels and sovereignty changes along with Fatigue ruined it for me. Fatigue is a shocking mechanic that encourages actually logging off. 
---
Not played in two years but I imagine the sov map looks pretty much the same. 
---
Do miss the player base though there’s no other game comes close.  
---
Yes, but the fact the "denial" by default is dropping Titans, Dreads, Carriers, and FAX's immediately on even a small gang of frigates is horse shit. 
---
To me at least using a cyno should be for only moving and staging of these giant ships, not immediate tactical dump on every rookie ship that enters your space.
---
no, looted cap parts and cap charges, bringing them out to sell, bringing Sabres back in
---
I'm in a c4 though, so dst is the best we can do 
---
yea but there's a wide gap between "lose a thing I have four of" and "lose something that took me 150 hours to build"
---
Can you just do us all a favor and stop posting then. Olmeca/Marshy's group posting about botting Rorquals and the Anti-Marshy Goon Krab posters "HE MUST BE INPUT BROADCASTING XDDDD" side belong on r/cringe instead.
---
I am resting comfortably on my laurels. 
---
Why? Do you expect Eve to be even more resource intensive per client?
---
Sort your damn modules. 
---
You: kid with stick poking wasp nest
---
&gt; 1) Fix FAXes (i.e. nerf them into the ground for subcap fights by adding a sig radius modifier to RR)
---
The problem with a fax isn't how it remote reps, it's how much it local reps and that it can do that mostly without giving a shit about neuts because of injectors. The apostle I have in my hangar can perma tank 4-6x the DPS what the Archon I used to have in my hangar did for maybe about 800m more.
---
Old triage was almost definitely the most skilled role that existed in fleet combat outside actually FCing, then they cut the skill ceiling down to your ankles and gigabuffed the ship class.
---
So I've never owner a structure or really dealt with them, I see he has a (presumably) heavy neut on one of the faxs and is attacking the Erebus with missiles and just hit for ~40000 damage.
---
This might be a stupid question, but which side will win this fight? The citadel gunner seat looks kind pretty cool from here.
---
Nothing - this game is doomed because it's rooted deeply with bittervets and their insecure machismo of "harden the fuck up". I'm not expecting this game to be theme park MMO, but there are concepts that need to die the fuck off.
---
Somebodys tired
---
1 its gambling: the losses from gambling have actually signifcantly increased, more and more people are effected.
---
2 its not allowed in my country (EA Folded like last month too it) and more and more countries are following suit.
---
3 if EA jumps of a bridge, will you?
---
Mar5hy's afk camping is the only thing that diminishes Delve farmers' safety.
---
People farming 16 trillion ISK / month in a region is why PLEX prices are high. If you pump money into an economy then you get inflation. The downward pressure from Rorqual mining balances the T1/T2 ship values but it's only natural that other non-mined stuff inflates.
---
Yes, I agree wholeheartedly. I'd like to see standard PvE content transform into a Null wide incursion mechanic. I.e Serpentis are here, grind them out, get your payouts and then they are gone for some odd amount of time.
---
All the Imperium members actually are having deployments of sorts. Reddit just knows about the Init deployment thank to the many posts made about it, unlike deployments of other Imperium members - and now Bastion.
---
Bastion have always been a meatshield alliance so this changes nothing. 
---
Amusing idea, but 2/10 on execution. 
---
Make hisec safe again.
---
Test 1 2
---
Amazing, thank you
---
Sorry :(
---
Cracks?
---
I personally think it's misplaced hatred. Everyone loves jumping to the "iT's wHaT sTaRtEd pRoLiFeRaTiON" conclusion, but in reality, it's a situation that's inevitable in a true sandbox game and was more importantly already happening before injectors.
---
Because it was inevitable, CCP should have already had plans in place before it got to this point. Injectors certainly didn't help this situation, but they also let people who aren't 5+ year veterans yet still devoted to the game to catch up and do fun things. Bottom line: if CCP already had plans to stop this from happening before injectors were even thought of, by the time they rolled around we would have only the best part of injectors without any of the worst.
---
With all that said, even CCP removed injectors and rorquals were boosting ships again, everyone would just re-adjust their opportunity cost and exploit the next best thing. Rather than buying injectors, they'd just buy character mills from the bazaar and use exhumers instead. Would it slow things down? Sure, but only for a while before people learn to min/max the newold system.
---
Be Mar5hy in an afk camper. Decloak. Target the bot Nyx. Ship scan. It doesn't attack you. Anchor a bubble on its alignment path. It goes into the bubble. Cyno up. Bring in dreads. It still doesn't attack anyone. Dies quietly. Doesn't even have a cyno.
---
That's when they are really obvious.
---
Happened twice in the same day. They were kicked before we killed a 3rd Nyx.
---
An idiot living out of an NPC station no less :-D
---
some cowards bring faxes, real cowards warp away
---
This post is like a beaten housewife turning to others and saying “sure he beats me, but to be fair I have the power to change myself so he won’t .. plus we have good health care now so ...”
---
No.. CCP have been fucking around for several years playing their own internal game of thrones and the ceo has been refocusing resources on unfinished ideas / sugar rushes .. at the expense of the game.. now they are awake and while it’s still early days they have a fuck tonne more work to do ..
---
So ... stop taking the beatings 🥴
---
I enjoy looking at all those sexy portraits in Alliance chat
---
You claim that Injectors made things convenient.
---
You are correct.
---
And that's the problem. They are convenient. Far too convenient. The opportunity costs (sellers' time spent making alts, and buyers' time searching and bidding) excluded most of the playerbase. 
---
I think they were going to redo faxes entirely or something but gave up because the first nerf of cap bonus and rep amounts was enough to ruin them for wormholes 
---
Caps should never have gotten out of the scope where even a big alliance would struggle to build and field just a few of them. The Titan was supposed to be more like a flagship, now they are just as common as any t1 frigate it seems like.
---
This reads like a Buzzfeed title.
---
&gt; I can tell you but you'll keep shittting on him anyway.

Or you can speak up?

ok so how is this guy winning?
---
Ah ok thx
---
Oh this is flair bait. I just know it.
---
undock from station, ignore that running cyno, click warp instead of align to gate, super appears, panic and spam warp instead of stop ship and dock, die to alpha
---
You'll get armchair game devs crawling out of the woodwork everytime "game code" or "fixes" are mentioned.
---
I don’t care about my grammar unless it’s for work, legal, or school.
---
&gt;  Or you can speak up and not gatekeep information?
---
I am though. I spoke in every Mar5hy thread.
---
&gt;  You can't see me, or anyone else, but we're collectively rolling our eyes and groaning now.
---
You are in a literal witchunt thread. One of many for Mar5hy's name or mine, just because we happen to kill stuff in Delve. If you are rolling eyes to that information then you either lack proper background to understand what's going on, or just a Goon who contribute to the witchunt.
---
Fair call.  Anything from massive alliances, corp/alliance roles, Eve University, Bombers Bar/Spectre Fleet, mining/industry, etc...  There is a huge amount of variety in the game and it mostly came from players' ingenuity/creativity.
---
that is a terrible definition of pay2win that nobody uses and basically means that almost no games are pay2win as almost all items can be grinded out.  What everybody agrees is the definition is that pay2win means that you pay cash for an advantage, be it less grinding or less time etc. spent getting an item.   
---
Tactical cap dumping should never have been allowed to be sure. A cyno should only have ever been for moving and staging purposes of capital ships, and have a long spool up before the jump.
---
Null blobs just insta-blob anything and it has definitely made small gang ops feel not worth it to even attempt anymore since you have to roam like 30 empty systems to even find anything worth killing beforehand, then you just get fagged anyway. 
---
If ccp revamped faction warfare, and snuff imploded. 
---
I can’t dream right?
---
I often debate to come back, buy gametime with isk and blow the rest of my isk in a few weeks by solo roaming lowsec in battleships. 
---
But then I remember my bookmark folder is full to the brim, and since I am kind of anal with safespots I would have to copy at the very least hundreds of bms in intervalls of 10 for at least 2 characters, and that's the point where I nope the fuck out.
---
I assume they didn't change anything about how bookmarks are stored/copied since they upped the amount you can copy at once from 5 to 10?
---
Praise James! May he reign 1000 years! \\o/
---
So, you only want to not look like you lack an eeucation when you are getting a grade of a paycheck? How's that working out for you?
---
Have a single goal at first - pve? Great! PvP? Excellent! Don't try to do a bit of everything, every corp I see that claims to do everything ("we're a highsec Indy explo pvp corp with 10 members! Join now!")... Does nothing. 
---
I wasn’t arguing that. Most of them are clearly being run by a small number of people. I just meant that the number of botted VNI’s is pretty remarkable. 
---
Better if you have a good computer, worse if you don't.
---
It’s single threaded as it’s the UI thread which would maintain the game loop and paint instructions. All other threads are background workers to handle the workloads, however at some point they always need to attach back to the main thread for paint changes. 
---
You can spot this easily by opening the skill window, I’d wager that because of the amount of denormalized data it has to not only unpack but bind all over several frames (hence you get that jarring sluggish opening)
---
Like I’ve said always, 64bit will give you more elbow room but you still need to gut the fuck out of the client and refactor / redo a lot of work to make use of that new elbow room. Which puts a lot of trauma on the code base, especially with QA needs. Given there is around a 5:1 (dev to QA) ratio in CCP, this type of work needs to be carefully considered.
---
It also depends on their threading strategy, is it raw threads you can create / collapse or is it using a coroutine strategy?  Hoping the first not the later as mixing threading with coroutine is cancer.. see every unity3d scale issue to date on why...
---
it's querns so
---
He wins by getting his carrier and end or very late game hull ... but is an unskilled pilot. Hence... it's still p2w but isk and ships dont mean skill.
---
The thing about pvp for me is that making the isk to fund it has been hard. Esp if you want a nice ship like a t3c. Is buying plex what most people do in this situation?
---
Yes they should. Nullsec has always been for the large scale. Lowsec was supposed to be the alternative. But by letting caps into lowsec not to mention how citadels defeated the point of faction warfare, lowsec is now too much like null. Null isn't broken, low is.
---
Once you have a few running, it's very easy to start getting more set up.
---
Even so, keeping the mentality away from "everyone is a bot, nobody actually plays Eve" starts by reminding people how few people actually use bots. The human number is low even if the number of accounts is staggering.
---
My last run with Bombers Bar was pretty infuriating because of PANIC horse shittery. We caught rorqs fair and square, and: nevermind! They hit panic so the cap blob can roll in and save them. 
---
Fuck that. This is this shit that makes EVE not really worth playing anymore unless you're an established nullbear
---
Read it again, I think you misunderstand 
---
that could actually be an interesting use of ess until someone actually tries to kill / steal them.
---
if they write the bot to kill ess's it could be a nice way to bait them with the bubble
---
I understand exactly. That's brave of you.
---
Would it kill it though? I think a lot of bittervets would seriously enjoy starting over. Losses hurt and wins are actually wins again. The economy would need fixing a bit though.
---
Thank you. What attracted me to EVE originally was blogs where people were telling stories, and I was struck by how different they all were, how many different stories were being told. It made me wonder "what on earth is going on in there".
---
I feel like the capicatiy for a well built sandbox game to create a universe for people to play in is a hell of a thing. I'm trying to share a little of what my own personal adventure is like in the videos.
---
What stops, say, on core computing the speed and position of all the ships and another core using that information along with signature radius to compute wether your shots will hit. Do they have to run the entire game in parallel to use multi core?
---
For real though. CCP has been trying to break away from EVE for years and failed every step of the way while neglecting the one thing that paid their bills. AFAIK CCP is not publicly traded, because if it was there is no way Hilmar would not have been forced out by now. 
---
Not really, ratting drama is not that uncommon.  I don't rat much anymore since I just do market investing, but I always hating ending up in a system with them.

Thats the problem, what mechanic would you be thinking of that would let you fight over isk, its not like you could award isk for killing a player on the same level as ratting isk, players would instantly game the system.
---
You could balance the amount of loot destroyed based on the people and ships involved in a fight, with fair fights dropping more of the dead guys loot and less fair/ganks dropping less of the dead guys loot, proportional to how bad of a gank it is.
---
That would make balanced fights more appealing to the people who dont pve and need loot from pvp to buy new ships.
---
No matter what you do tho your always gona piss off some neck beard who feels like your cool idea is gona hurt his precious gameplay and he will reeeee against it with all his might. 
---
Thx man
---
I mean.... That depends. I once saw MarkJ2 solo half of HK before they got evicted. So I’d argue there is a scale and knowledge of nanogang would help tilt it in your favor. BUT that knowledge is usually found mot going solo. 
---
Going solo from the get go is akin bashing your head against the wall. Just let someone guide you.
---
This was the 20 man AF gang? Yeah that was a good choice on your FCs part, but I figure I would check how bored you guys were :)
---
Yeah, here's hoping we can both find some good fights.
---
Well, half of that is alts (at least), and then maybe another quarter are just there to rat / mine.
---
Now, lets give the benefit of the doubt, and say they have 1000, active, real people.
---
that would put, if we evenly distribute numbers, \~250 per timezone, or 1 full fleet.  On major stratops you maybe see 15 or 20 bastion guys tops.
---
Alliance numbers don't say everything, or really much of anything.  Look at GSF.  What is it, like 30,000 people? How many of those do you think actively do anything?
---
T3cs don't have any bonuses to explo specifically. What they do have is a couple of subs that absolutely help explo. The covert cloak sub and the interdiction nullified sub. On top of that its super easy to fit a probe launcher in any fit. Butttt it's a cruiser It's fat and slow compared to a explo frig and not recommended.
---
Lol, touche' and I don't have any inside information.  I just know that Carneros is a solid guy, and I feel like he has to make a lot of tough decisions.  It will be interesting if nothing else.
---
Triggered
---
you're not wrong, PVE is boring as fuck and always has been a painful, mind numbing grind. With the Abyssal update I realized CCP is creatively bankrupt since they just keep reskinning and recycling the same, tired, old, boring mechanics. 
---
Shoot limited AI ships. Get the loot. Shoot limited AI ships. Get the loot. Fucking shoot me. 
---
some one mentioned on the test server that the 64bit client was taking up 5gig of ram. if its gona take up 5 gig per client then clearly their gona have a defacto limit on the number of clients you can run.
---
Yours aren't? You bring shame upon all of Goonswarm
---
Now where’s Federico when you need him?
---
So does twitter .. oh wait you think the animations and shit are special .. eve at its rawest technical level is like IRC / twitter with everyone screaming into the same thread at once .. client shiny aside sending packets to a server to process is where the “special sauce” stops. From that point onwards it’s the same conditions as twitter, Facebook, irc, PayPal, &lt;insert every enterprise / e-commerce solution here&gt;
---
To counter my response you’d first have to say out loud “the client does all the work” which it doesn’t (first rule of multiplayer gaming - client is always lying check for lies)
---
CCP do not horizontal or vertically scale based on load, the fact they are using a hybrid on-prem server strategy indicates that they are still behind the 8ball on cloud scale solution architectural strategies. Given they also don’t have automation it would also mean that a human still needs to be notified of upcoming big fights but even then all that person is doing is balancing over to nodes with more hardware (vertical)... however the clients won’t react to a parallel processing strategy, so they can’t multiplex their packets to one to many in pipes (horizontal)...
---
Also bare in mind games like Wow, Apex legends, Fortnight solve this problem on a scale that dwarfs eve.. the only unique difference is that 2k to 5k players in the one “system” is the challenge.. but that’s also largely due to a bottleneck in catchment of inbound data, processing algorithms that are likely still individually assessed and then lastly latency to send back out per tick .. 
---
This argument held up in 2005... 2019.. fuck no 
---
A reason to fight.  All space is the same, what is there to fight over?
---
Limit keepstars to one per alliance, one per region. And triple the build cost.
---
It's absolutely mind boggling that so many can exist without limitations, and with such a comparatively small investment by bloc powers.
---
Keepstars should be your capital structure, your entire alliance's crowning achievement. Instead they get anchored as staging points like small groups use Astras.
---
Letting titans dock without restriction was a colossal mistake. Reining it back a bit would help a lot with that.
---
Bro I once skill injected into a fucking Dreadnought on my main over winter break. That bitch cost me at least 12BIL. Whenever I hear about people dropping billions to skill inject its usually for fucking sabre alts. I don’t think it’s as prevalent as you guys think. You have to be stupid fucking rich.
---
Thats because CCP in usual fashion fumbled the ball with World of Darkness which is where the EVE in-station stuff would have been derived from. Captains Quarters was all that remained of that project. 
---
Here is a fascinating look at how to completely fuck up a game, mismanage your business, and waste millions of Dollars:
---
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/world-of-darkness-the-inside-story-mmo-ccp-white-wolf
---
Not always he could be doing them in batches .. if you watch his twitch videos he logs in batches at a time not all at once ... I’d say he still fucked up and either logged in via isboxer command line and forgot to individually cloak them ... or .. he as the op states fucked up the click...
---
And as such, he limits himself to only what can come through a covert cyno. If he wasn't so afraid of loss, he would have more options.
---
Just Goons gone then basically...
---
you are nowhere near as wealthy as the average multi rorqual krab 
---
I agree. Sub-caps need sov objectives. Leave the last sov stage to the caps. I'm so tired of caps and infinite wealth. Where are the goals? Put in objectives for enemies to achieve in sub-caps. I'd love to see roams into null space that can impact those that live there other than waiting for pvp. 
---
I was banned by Guard, gagged by Guard, worked with Svenni, drank with Svenni, and now am saddened by Guard leaving CCP.  
---
I watched you fight MMA stars, I watched you rap on a stage in front of 1200 nerds and some very confused Icelanders, I watched you have tons of crazy energy every day around the office and on EVE TV broadcasts of all varieties.
---
You own and you will be sorely missed.
---
I would come back if capitals, supers and titans were no longer the answer to every situation. Haw titans and dreads should not the response to a small roaming gang. Fighters track sub-caps way too well. 
---
Caps should be the answer to structure grinds or other caps. Sub-caps need to have some advantages over caps to bring them back into the meta. Capitals should have to rely on sub-caps for protection from other sub-caps, this is basic game design that some how has evaded CCP.  The current titan meta is bland, boring and bad for the game.
---
You might have misunderstood a point there. Yes, the point of the 64 bit client is having access to more RAM per client. That becomes an issue in mega wars (e.g. 2000 people on same grid). In those situations, once the client needs more RAM than it can use, it crashed. Now it can access to more RAM, and perhaps 5 gig, in those battles.
---
That does not necessarily mean everyday activities will become more resource intensive. I hope not.
---
AFK cloakers don't exactly strike often enough for reshipping to be an issue.
---
When I started secondary school we had art class and the teacher let us mess around with clay which was wicked fresh because clay. Everyone had a great time making clay things but there was this really obnoxious girl who kept going round the table and slamming her hand into people's arts. This was bullshit.
---
So I did what any 12 year old would do and I found a 6 inch nail and wrapped it up in clay and left it on the table. Her scream still sends shivers down my spine. That was seriously fucked up. I thought I would get expelled and arrested and shit. Was a fucking retard thing to do, the nail went straight through her hand when she hulk smashed it and let out this awful shriek that sounded like a young girl with a 6 inch nail in her fucking hand. I didn't get in trouble though because she was a twat I guess.
---
That was my 2nd least favourite school experience. 
---
Prevent use of capital guns, fighters, and DDs so all capitals can do in lowsec is move through it.
---
No I’m not I only just now started plexing my first alt. 
---
You wanna know whats super extra gay?
---
4 Rorquals in a C6 red giant can clear sites in under 5minutes. They can make 2-3Bil an hour and are also the end all be all of J-space krabbing :&lt;
---
Yeah, this isn't how Eve works. If the defending group was required to use a similar comp, then a cyno goes up and out comes the attacker's cap blob. 
---
This would be great if living in wormholes wasn't fucking awful.
---
I tried it and hated it. Some kind of NPC null that only let Jump Freighters through would be perfect.
---
For that caps and cynos must be banned from LS completely. 
---
It would even make sense in lore terms  I think. FW is still technically empire space, why would any of them allow foreign cynos or caps in their systems anyway? They don't allow Dreads and shit in hisec why would it be any different in lowsec...
---
Why, yes, we put trillions of isk on the field because we're afraid of losing it. Uh huh.
---
No. We use the capital umbrella because we want to demoralize you. We don't want you to come back.
---
imagine actually being this fucking retarded
---
The time to invest on geckos was when they were 10 M each.
---
You make 3bil an hour with 3 dreads anyways in any effect
---
Theres only so much solo battleship roaming I can do before I pull out my hair due to gatecamps, hot drop o clocks or some other bullshit. I'm also quite *tired* of the lack of communication about ship balance and what it'll take before we get that designated ship balance team.
---
Also, null is too safe and lowsec has been ignored for too long.
---
Despite all this I still play the game although not as often as I used to.
---
Each user's experiences are different, for some people it has, for some it's got better and others have stayed the same. 
---
in terms of fleet participation
---
POSes used to be able to defend themselves when the owners were logged off. CCP said somewhere (which for the life of me I can no longer find) that part of the existing system came from the fact that Citadels couldn't do that.
---
Let citadels fire back without manual control.
---
Drop a cyno inhib 999 km off a hostile keepstar. Cloak up, float away. Wait for somebody to kill it, rinse, repeat.  Easy griefing tool. Do that to any citadel anywhere. Folks will scream bloody murder. 
---
While i don't have the final solution i have a concept for something i call 'The Comet hunt'. I believe generally in eve that timers where impotent event takes place have worked great for planning both RL and for ingame coordination of assets. The vision of the coment hunt is to have comets pop up randomly in different system, but where its public knowledge where and when they will enter the system. While not going too much into details the comets will firstly need to be webbed down to 0 m/s and then a syphoning unit will de deployed to 'mine' the comet. This structure has a mini reinforcement time (think ESS unit) of say 10 min, where enemies can gain access to the resources if left unattended. The ressouces pulled from the comet will greatly be different in quantity and quality over the mining period - the last and center part of the comet will be worth a big part of the comet, and will be able to fit in 50-100 m3 while the first part of the comet will be ice sort of m3. (Exotic fuel was my first suggestion, while the center of the comet will be need as distillators or something)  
---
This, or a similar envisioned concept could work as mini conflict drivers that would bring people to the same system, where pvp might happen while shifting away from grinding. If nothing happens you gain some isk. If people show up you might have fun. What i'm thinking is that there's different sizes of comets that will attract different groups and sizes of fleets. On a small comet it won't be worth for any big entity to come (because the share of isk/ressources per person will be too low) but it might bring out a couple of small gang fleets. While the biggest comets might have a longer timer (be announced days before), and might be worth so much that people from across the universe would be interested in taking part in the action. 
---
So what do you suggest he drop in Delve instead? 
---
I'm glad people are finally coming around to this mentality. Seemed like a few years ago people loathed the idea of small groups taking space, the consensus was that they didn't "deserve" it if they couldn't somehow acquire it from the groups several hundred times their size and manage to keep it while those groups crushed them into dust for trying.
---
No caps and small fleets... pretty much what everyone wants. BTW, this is how Eve used to be in it's prime. 
---
No you misunderstand comrade.  Those are all the bots who automated mumble to call for help.
---
Being unemployed again.
---
I'm not sure anything could bring me back. 
---
When I first started playing in null-sec up in fade a year or so before  WWB there was so much small gang PVP. My corp used to regularly fight gangs of 6-10 people roaming around. 
---
If you wanted action you only had to take out a handful of cruisers and within 20 minutes you'd find a fight. A fun one. GFs all round. 
---
Now I have a Titan, 3 accounts, and a dozen capitals (including a rorqual obviously). 
---
The Titan was built out of pure boredom. Nothing else to do so might as well mine. 
---
Every time we take a small gang out you either go 70 gates without seeing a single person, or the first cruiser you find lights a cyno and you're dead from a dozen supers. 
---
It's so unbelievably boring. 
---
I'm afraid to me Eve is already dead. The good CCP staff are mostly all gone. They have no real connection to the playerbase any more and they genuinely just don't seem to care. 
---
It's in the final throws now and I have no interest in being in a 20hr long Titan bashing fight where it's just about which side brought the most supers. 
---
Truthfully the only thing that kept me logging in was talking to the many friends I've made over the years but as the game has stagnated those friends have slowly but surely stopped logging in meaning the last real reason I had to keep plexing my accounts has gone. 
---
It still makes me sad though 😔
---
This is a dumb question. But is it at all possible to have the clients do part of the server loads with P2P or utilizing some epic sort of blockchain technology? Or isn't that technically possible or even an improvement?

Creating interesting, fun and challenging PvE content has been a huge challenge for the entire history of game development, but especially for MMO games.
---
If we are honest, most games are basically the same - the concepts and mechanics hardly offer unique experiences, it's more of the same, wrapped in different textures. Even most story lines are quite similar, be it main story or side quests.
---
Hollywood recycles the same recipe for most of their movies, so does the gaming industry - because that's what makes them money at the end of the day, especially since gaming isn't a nerd hobby anymore but a mainstream experience.
---
Most companies don't want to walk that risky path of innovation and creativity, mostly because the investment is huge. People who create new worlds, write amazing lore, breathe life into virtual universes and create something unique are rare and expensive - so  companies will focus on things they always were able to pull off while selling millions of copies: visuals. 
---
Take away all those shiny textures and you will realize there is't much left to enjoy other than some repetitive old story re-wrapped to make it look fresh.
---
CCP is doing the same. Why invest into something that might not even generate more revenue? Recycling the same ideas and concepts over and over is much cheaper and increases the overall profits no matter what.
---
Just remove "agressive" from drones. 
---
it's a structure bash. It even comes with a 7 minute rf timer
---
My point was mainly that if you can instantly drop a cap blob on a hit and run fleet of frigs/cruisers you got a huge balance problem that ultimately makes small gang pointless. 
---
Defenders should have to similarly undock some shit, whatever it is, and hop gates to catch you, not just log into one of their 100 cyno alts in every system so they can jump their 100 cap alts directly into your face. 
---
Yeah they are certainly worse in w-space although ninazus are still pretty cancer to deal with, just not as silly as they where.
---
Oh wow, as a new player, that's just how I assumed it worked, as that makes the most sense. I thought you'd train Industry V, extract it, and now you're back to Industry 4. Just kinda made sense that way, from my perspecitve, and would match the way skillbooks worked.
---
As a most likely more experienced player, between the two (how it works now, and how I thought it worked), which do you prefer?

Space is endless. There is never a chance that any civilization will be able to cooperate with each other, and explore everything at the same time. It is just the nature of souls and beings in particular to keep things from each other, and if two sentient races try to keep control over one thing, it is inevitable that they will either destroy each other, destroy the other, or separate. They will never control it in unison. These are the types of factors and data that we needed to know beforehand when using the Gates. The place on the otherside is completely different from everything we know, and even things we think are concrete and can't change, be different, or even not exist, happen completely normally. We don't know if this other place is one universe or dimension, or if each time we go through a Gate we reach a different one. The only thing we do know, they are all strange and alien, and that we won't ever be living in them. We will always be stuck in the one we are born in, limited to only learning what exists in it. There is nothing "normal" in the other places.  We just aren't compatible with them. Beware of ethereal Septogen!

CCP has discussed lootboxes for sure and it wouldn't surprise me if that idea has been floating around for a while already. To assume they never thought of this is a bit naive.
---
It's one of those concepts a gaming company will have a look at and then make a decision based on some number crunching. The sad truth is: in most cases it will increase profits, even if it angers the player base because at the end of the day, people will just swallow it.
---
Hooooly shit lol you're in rare form today querns. Don't forget guys, the only reason mar5hy uses bombers is cause they're cheap and he's too much of a pussy to drop REAL shit in delve. It's definitely not cause bombers can fit covert cynos. Ignore the dread drops, those don't count.

Have you been in one of those 10 hour fights?
---
I've been in one.
---
One.
---
I wouldn't blame a single person for skipping out on that shit.
---
I second what this guy said. Tiny’s hyperactivity is what made him a successful eve corp founder.
---
He would also say that you shouldn’t. But If you do, you need to find a goal for your corp and make sure nobody else is doing this. Also don’t get into the trap new wormhole corps do and go onto C4 space. It’s literally cancer in every-way. If you want to do this, it’ll be legit work. If you don’t pay people to scan it’ll be tough.
---
Your first priority is content for your bros. This is why I recommend a C5. You can roll new chains in a single capital pass. This means more options for content. (Even if you can’t now, eventually someone will join who can). C5 space is the most plentiful, yet less occupied space and you should be able to kick out some dead corp, then take their assets to start your corp.
---
I would strongly suggest finding a way for rich corpys to get their shit hauled in by poor corpies at reasonable rates. Tbh C5 logistics can be quite easy. You can Cyno JF’s and other capitals into wormholes and no dirty K spacer will dare go in after you. c4 space will absolutely never have a wondering K-space connection. Which means you will never know what it feels like to have a new sig land you 3 jumps from jita. Just say no to K-Space. 
---
If you have guys with trouble farming in C5’s you can clear exceptional /rarified ore sites, vasts and bountiful gas sites and daytrip to C3’s /C13’s when they roll into you. Or you can do corp wide confessor/guardian gangs when you roll into wolf rays. Also I highly suggest PI &amp; scanning skills on all your alts and have them in your hole. The PI is god tier. 
---
Oh and learn how to use illustrator and make videos. Cause eve propaganda is hot shit
---
Also you’ll want to do full API vetting of all your people. Make a spreadsheet in google sheets of your roster w/their main and all associated alts. So that when someone leaves they don’t leave behind vampire accounts for intel or to suck on your bros gas without giving you content. You can just go ahead and do them the courtesy of kicking their old alts. (It’ll make your corpys feel safer about keeping assets in the hole). 
---
Oh and here’s a word of fucking warning. Do not tailor your corp after anyone else. Do your own fucking thing. If you model your corp after lazerhawks, you will bring in a bunch if lazerhawks wannabes who are going to get into your leadership and leave you at the drop of a hat to go join lazerhawks. The older more renowned groups poach their members from who they like from wormhole space And literally what happened to shekel squad.
---
You need a clearly defined corp that is unique and your own and to vet people who idolize anyone you fight. You’re also going to want to be really fucking careful with the culture of your corp.
---
Best of luck.

It obviously has a demoralizing effect. The only action you and yours get at all is using the most risk averse tactics, chosen not for their combat effectiveness, but their ability to flee. You and yours crow about killing *drones.* If you went back in time five years and told me that Eve players would celebrate killing a drone, I'd hit you, then have you committed for your own safety.

How many fighter squadrons can carriers use? I see in the info they have 3x light and 1x support. Are they limited to 3 (the number of launch tubes) or can they launch all 4 squadrons at once?
---
You definitely aren't. You at least have to take me to dinner first.
---
sorry to break it to ya but "specialist roles" in f1 fleets ain't that above f1 itself, unless you're the anchor and/or fc I guess
---
The thing that gets me addicted is making revenue then optimising it then finding other revenue sources optimising it, using the money to learn pvping wich gets me insane adrenaline rushes even tho I die most of the time
---
And I never stop playing. On the screen you can see a vector navy issue wich is a ratting ship. I went in lowsec for some combat site ratting
---
Nobody bullied me anywhere, I just got a bit of wanderlust as happens from time to time, wanted to see the big universe. 
---
I am doing well, I hope you are as well.
---
You almost pulled the trigger there tho, didn't you?
---
Je considérerai l'offre, et pour l'overview je sais c'est juste que l'ancien overview que j'avais semble avoir disparu et j'avais la flemme d'aller en installer un nouveau
---
Rorqual mining was a mistake.  The weird part is, even CCP knew that before Rorquals got excavators.
---
CCP long held a belief that, 'No ship shall out-mine a Hulk!'
---
So when changes to the Rorqual were made, Rorqual pilots largely didn't ask for excavators, nor P.A.N.I.C., but rather quality-of-life changes to the ship.
---
So any fault with Rorqual mining rests squarely on the shoulders of CCP.
---
Your entire damn argument is "what should they have dropped, huh? HELP THEM OUT THEY NEED YOUR GUIDANCE AUUUUGGGHHH." The hell kind of goalposts do I even have here? I just refuse to help people kill our guys.
---
Many moons ago CCP said they were going to add rigs for (jump) freighters. Then a few weeks later they backtracked because it was pretty dumb.
---
Lots of market people started building capital rigs because there was literally zero supply (with them being useless and all).
---
Because the characters on the character bazaar were representations of actual SP gained over time. If the name matters so much on a toon that isn't your main guy, a better solution would be to have a name changing item available from CCP for plex/cash/isk, or to have characters bought from the bazaar have an optional name change after purchase.  
---
The real problem with injectors is they let people have a 100% passive, 100% safe method of converting time into ISK, even AFK, with NO resource investment other than isk for skillbooks and multi-training certs. NOT that they're an alternative to character trading.
---
From a TEST member no less lmao
---
Only problem I have with it is it widens the gap between players and BOTs, which have no issues at all targeting and attacking rats as we know from super bots.
---
We need better results against bots before going after afk income imo. The mentioned automation in some dev blog (or was it a dev reddit reply?) holds a certain prospect. 
---
Once we are there (having won the bot war (one can dream) and removed aggressive drones) we can already keep a closer eye on auto targeting missiles, which at glance seem to be the next best thing, needing only to be reactivated after reach reload. 
---
that's all we're doing, I'm just saying we get opportunities for any one of us to do hisec logistics every day. not that we need one every day
---
I don't want any hostiles in Delve at all, really. 
---
shsh little newkrab. adults are talking.
---
They are the biggest single reason I left the game.
---
Two problems with your idea:
---
One, you have no evidence CCP has a functional or competent analytics team.
---
Two, I did software analytics for five years at a major software company, and no amount of analytics will give the depth of knowledge you seem to think it does. Analytics just tells us what people do. You seem to think it tells us why they do it.
---
What exactly did you hate? I'm not sure a week is a fair shake. Did you have a corp?
---
They are the biggest single reason I left the game. 
---
He doesn’t. 
---
More groups like provi that refuse to bend the knee.
---
Roaming is trying to generate content - IE fights that feel good for both parties. Getting shitstomped by campers and capitals is NOT a feel good moment for people roaming from outside null. Just makes people want to roam less and less.
---
Go to WH space.
---
Because some people pay for their sub with isk. The higher Plex goes, the longer they have to rat or mine to earn the isk. 
---
Because then it is too easy to warp to the structure.
---
100 km was chosen because it is less than warp distance.
---
Has pathfinder been fucking up for you recently?
---
Tiny left basically lol. I didnt like how they were going when he left. So I was like fuck this. Brovac it is!
---
I also imagine he isn't running them at high settings loading a million things on Friday when he has that many running like someone on the test server would be doing. 
---
An active Elo Knight running Black Legion in the homeland, with no jump changes. Not a very popular opinion, but I had so much fucking fun when TSK was in BL.
---
Back to discord with your "u mad" post.
---
someone that is not me is eating shit....
---
....even fight overall. 
---
time to retire 'eating shit' if it means 'even steven'.
---
When are we getting our highsec gate to Delve?
---
It would potentially fix some small issues like rorqs and capital proliferation slightly.  But as long as injectors are left in Goons would organize and take off so much faster than everybody else it would be insanity. This would make the game completely unplayable. 
---
pretty sure they are timed, so just clear one, move onto the next, check the first after 20 or so minutes
---
This is already the case.  Just hit up zkill.  On average about 1 dies per day. 
---
Capitals are broken but you havn't even used them in 10 years?
---
There has to be a point to being in your corp. I haven't run any corps in eve but in *some other game* our whole reason to be was revenge and the total annihilation of the shit toasters who made us miserable when we were new. 
---
You need short term goals that lead to long term objectives. E.g: "We need a bunch of newbie shit to attract new players who we can indoctrinate with our fury and rage to grow stronger to murder all these motherfuckers" or "we need to train this that and this to murder that bastard with that sword, this gun and fucking bombs. Lots of bombs, Steve" or "we need to scam and hustle and save to get a secure HQ to store all the mad loot and corpses when we wreck their shit" or "we need to learn to fly so we can steal a plane while drunk, fly across the world, kidnap endgame NPCs and release them into the city because we are dead inside and grief is all we have left". 
---
Some might say we went to far but that's only because we broke into their apartment, set everything on fire and then escaped on their motorbikes that we just stole.
---
yeah from what the guy said during the test it was using 5gig, so i dunno anything else beyond that.
---
So iirc, you want a system with as low a security as possible, with an ass load of belts. Then take a ship (have heard of Gilas, Hecates, and ravens, but it probably works in a lot of ships) and go around killing belt rats. If you want the bounties, you wait for spawns with lots of battleships and kill the big ones and leave the little ones to respawn, if you want better spawns you kill everything and hope for a better spawn.
---
I'm part of goons, I'm waiting for the next big deployment where we are going to rekt another participant of WWB ( we gotta make them pay right ?) but after the 6RCQ deployment I decide to take a break, I burn out from this game pretty hard, was almost 24/7 log during 6RCQ joining as much fleets as I could etc, going back to peacetime was hard, after 4/5 month I decide to try something I always wanted to try : Carrier dropping in hostile places, no more delve, no more super umbrella, no more blue space, no more blob, I'm doing it solo some corp mate join me but well we are still a small scale, I taking video of every drop maybe one day I will make a 30+ min video long of it who knows but what I want to say by that is, I never had so much fun, so much adrenaline rush, you don't even need to leave your blob, just do it alone have some fun (ok next week my 4 years goal going to be achieve : my first titan and I will for sure going back to blob space to boson some fleets but well :p)
---
They've been broken for a long time.
---
WH's were whining about capitals before it became cool
---
I never said that they did. I honestly doubt they do, or they have it and lack the talent/resources to make good use of it.
---
I agree that there is more to the solution, I just wasn't going to lay it all out in a reddit post. I too work in software, but as an engineer. I've worked in the games industry as well and know how these things are done. 
---
The bottom line is the CSM is not a good part of any solution. It was a PR stunt that out lived its usefulness years ago, and I can't see that it serves a useful purpose either in development or marketing that can't be accomplished more effectively in some other way 
---
Yup, that was us. We knew there was no way we were threatening your tank, particularly given how kitchen-sink-ish our comp was and the t1 ships we had sprinkled in, so we decided to keep going down the pipe and looking for ratters. We *were* bored enough eventually to welp into the -7- BC gang camping KBP7, but those at least had some small stuff we could kill and it was a lot later on so we were getting antsy with the lack of explosions. \^\^
---
"shouldnt be able to lock anything else" Basically making them useless period. "Oh hey these cant shoot us everyone grab catalysts lolololol"
---
imagine being so spineless you claim to have no power to control your own allies's actions on YOUR space
---
dude, people cry because they saw the exact same EVE ad they used to have on the new EVE luncher, so what if CCP make Lootbox, are you crazy ?
---
Constant scanning, having to mash dscan to do anything, no idea if I was alone or surrounded by cloaked ships, logistics sucked, especially for fuel, and I knew I couldn't go afk (or on vacation, a two week trip out of the country was coming up) since I'd risk losing whatever I had invested in the system, which for a little guy is too much to lose.
---
An auto-repeating dscan and a simpler probing system (or being able to auto-probe from structures over time using a service mod or something) would go a long way towards making it liveable, but without asset safety I don't think I could ever live there.
---
That's not out of complacency or anything. If people want to opt-in to a no-safety system that's fine and I applaud them for it. But it's definitely not for me, and there's only so much punishment a small group can take. At some point QOL needs to take precedence over hardcore. I enjoy that Eve's threshold for this is much further down the spectrum relative to other games, but the line needs to exist somewhere.
---
I had a very small corp. None of us liked it there and we ended up going to NPC null where we had a lot more fun living out of an Astrahus in an out-of-the-way system. Plenty of risk but with enough built-in facilities by the game to keep things going.
---
dont break your knuckles while trying to push that APM to 3.
---
Yeah, that's the problem with modern EVE, it's rocket science to find content.  If I had a thing that was less threatening but could still engage with your gang I would have brought it, but sadly I had no such thing.
---
Some things just can’t be undone. 
---
Maybe. I might be underestimating the actual isk amount. But they’re clearing sites as soon as the spawn.
---
What is 'brokenly OP' about them exactly? Carriers/Supers are easily countered with ECM drones. HAW dreads are stationary, with a huge lock time, you just warp/boosh away. I think most of the time you'll find that they are used in combination with subs as a force multiplier. Just the other day I was involved in a 3 way fight in null, one side had like 20 carriers and a few fax, we were in munins with scimis. We proceeded to kill tons of ravens, leshaks, loki's,etc, no issues. They put all their fighters on us, and we lost 1 logi, and 1 munin in a 45 minute fight. 
---
I think the real issue is 'small gang' PVPers not realizing that Null Sec isn't their personal playground. It's a vast section of space controlled by empires. You can't take 10 guys into an area controlled by thousands of players and complain when you get blobbed, caps dropped on you, etc. You walked in their home, what did you think their response would be? Would you feel better if instead of dropping 10 supers on you ,they bridged in 50 jackdaws?
---
fuck that, fly battleships
---
it'll be so much fun playing machariels online again because fuck flying any other battleship, you'll die of old age before you go 10 jumps 
---
can i keep him?
---
You say this while bitching about people being risk averse, yet you want to create a risk averse place for people to rat and mine I'm Delve.
---
You guys got like a tril? Not a whole lot pal
---
Its pace.... the problem goes deeper then just "you didn't earn your way to the top" ..thats the symptoms ... the root cause is different.
---
If you're a early-mid-game player with Injectors you can jump over a whole range of features / earning power to end up at the end-game experience(s)... this creates issues in the ecosystem beyond economics... boredom is an issue, you eventually run the "Eve season" out with top tier ships you were hunting but really aren't in the mood to lose them or can't find fights worthy of using them. This creates a content vs supply issue in systems, so fast forward and you're probably hunting Excavs and dunking on titans that misclick as a source of "Epic fights"
---
The demand gets higher as well, bots/multiplexers etc are all chasing the ISK drug line, so they can also feed the Skill Injector fiends out there who want to bypass impatience and get straight into &lt;insert ship here of choice&gt; this weekend or whatever. Which creates havoc in instability of game mechanics and also economy (blackmarket included).
---
Now you have your top tier ships, what do now? ....thats where the drug crash occurs, once you've tapped your injector supply dry for that "purpose" you were chasing... what do now? and thats where the game and the community ultimately falter.
---
did someone tell osm that jew is a verb or something 
---
Are t5s not mind numbing boring? I’ve been running t4 electrical in a Gaga and the payout doesn’t seem amazing and the only engaging part is the drifter wave where I have to actually manual pilot 
---
You are literally the problem that most of the people in this particular thread are complaining about. 
---
good god that music is horrible
---
Gee you haven't changed a bit. 
---
There's a hard limit of 3 squadrons. So 3 light, or 2 light and 1 support.
---
Thanks
---
Would you keep 3200s and heavy cap boosters? 
---
Follow in Civlization VI? footsteps, add randomized solar system variables like a solar flare destroys the tethering capabilities of all citadels system wide, you have to initiate repairs that cost isk or components before restoring functionality, or spiked radiation levels that have different effects on ships like in WH's or triglavian sites but have that all over new eden in every sec.
---
make things random that you have to adapt to..
---
like a drifter invasion / incursion for sov space. if you don't respond they will reset the sov eventually... 
---
So not one group can ever get too comfortable in their space, make things hostile A.F for afkers / bots.
---
that might spice it up a little, throw new eden back into the dark ages lol
---
Set a time stamp god damnit. No idea what you are talking about.
---
No, Time == Money before as well.  It was just my Money and some other guy's Time (via the character bazaar).
---
Just like now when you buy an Injector on the market you are spending your Money for someone else's Time.
---
I wasn't asking what we should drop because I don't know what we should drop. I was asking because you're a moron and I wanted to watch you squirm to answer when 4 comments ago you didn't even find your way to the conclusion that mar5hy is using bombers with [covert and regular cynos on them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/axnpi5/marshys_input_broadcasting_glitched_this_morning/ehvic30/). 
---
&gt; And as such, he limits himself to only what can come through a covert cyno. 
---
Like dreads?
---
&gt; If he wasn't so afraid of loss, he would have more options.
---
Like dreads. 
---
When travelling en-masse, fortizars are often used when keepstars are not available.
---
I have been part of a fleet that deployed one-at-a-time through a chain that used an Azbel mid-point.  I was a cyno, as I'm particularly good at picking spots.
---
Titans had very little wiggle-room, and would sometimes graze the structure, i.e. hit the structure, but not really move significantly in space.  Supercarriers were easier.
---
Why is excluding most of the playerbase from a useful service a good thing?
---
Isn't making things that some people can do accessible to other people a good thing?
---
Wormhole space is mostly dead. CCP killed em
---
That actually seems like a reasonable shakedown. I will say the rewards in C5/C6 holes make it well worth the risk, and when you learn rolling mechanics of your statics you can actually create a 'safe time' where new people can't enter the hole, removing the need to slam dscan and instead watch for new sigs. You can always live in NPC null, and just go in wormholes for some pew pew instead of living there. 
---
&gt;  but if you want to run t4s you put 1.1 bill at least on the line 
---
that's so wrong its not even funny
---
Bitching? No, friend, I'm mocking. I can do this irrespective of what we are or aren't doing on our side. If the people in question admit they're using coward tactics, then I got nothin' left. I can respect it, even, if they own it.
---
Yeah, the gap between a BS and a dread is a bit large in that case. Pretty sure we woulda mulched most BS pretty easy, but then you have a dread and it's way too much for what we had.
---
How about.... um.... **no**
---
You should just bail. Bad idea to let inhibs be on structures and you know it. 
---
In some cases I have used Marauders for that sort of thing, but I did not have one ready to go. 
---
I don't see a problem with this. If you can't keep your grid clear, why should you get uninhibited cynos into it?
---
And cyno inhibs are bulky and expensive, you couldn't keep this up for long without a huge logistical effort (which the sov owners could interdict).
---
No the rest of us a pretty tired of your incessantly bitching about how everyone is out to get you too. Be an adult and move on.
---
I think that was the whole point of the fort fitting the jams lol
---
Ha. Well said. 
---
You know vonhole is not involved with any alliance and just joins whichever group who's space he fancies hunting in?
---
Since extractor output is variable it should always be buffered into storage or it will be wasted. A factory that takes 3000 units as input only has 3000 units of buffer to fill while it's coverting the previous 3000 units.
---
How much work do you expect the smoothbrain to put in?!
---
Oh, I see what's going on -- you edited your post after you read what I replied to add a barely related zinger. Good job, you sure showed me by rewriting your end of the conversation after the fact.
---
Stop having shit for brains, and say what you mean to say the first time. I ain't got the patience to wait for the abortions you consider clever posts to filter through the activated charcoal in your skull.
---
&gt; That "trading tower" is a fucking tombstone on the grave that is this game.
---
You realize defending that thing takes several organized fleets a week. It doesn't just 'exist' because it's there.  It has also generated some great subcap content free from the interference of capitals.  That thing was one of the most interesting shakeups to my EVE experience in a while.
---
Yeah I get downvoted to hell for mentioning this. Imagine a group of 10 barbarians walking into Rome and starting shit. 
---
"BuT wE jUsT wAnTeD gUdFiTeS!!!"
---
Go back to Germany then. If we want good fights we will send a small gang out to fight you.
---
Harvesting tears
---
Dude. Just stop. Your embarrassing yourself 
---
A) they already fucking did with the shit festival that was the last event, and B) Don't fucking encourage them by talking about it.
---
Our brawl and LR dreads came in pretty close together. LR dread cyno had to readjust position, drifted too far away, but it was mere moments after brawl dreads each side started shooting
---
Mostly who you play with that makes eve fun
---
use a hammer to click the mouse button
---
That's why theirs init fleets in tribute as we speak?  Also NC. , PL, and PH have all deployed supers.
---
CCP bait done right
---
He says, while being utterly unaware of the difference between "your" and "you're." 
---
&gt;He wins by getting his carrier and end or very late game hull
---
That's not winning, you are confusing winning with acquiring stuff proving you are just a dirty Ferengi.
---
iirc, what you are describing is belt chaining regarding the selective farming method, and that's been nerfed for several years now last I checked.
---
right now im going to all my hi-sec pos bookmarks and check if they are offline so i can start wars and kill the nice mods (sma corphanger industri stuff) before the price of wars goes up to 100m next week 
---
Panfam had a bit of a failscade and bled a lot of corps either to Horde or to other external blocs, but seems to have largely stabilized.
---
The main thing that happened is Goons cemented supercap dominance, but aside from GOTG losing Pure Blind which was only partially, nothing really happened.
---
who are you kidding? We'd riot in the office on hilmar's desk with actual torches and pitchforks.
---
JEzzz chill ppl! Dam so much hate......its a NO THEN....lets move it along.
---
For what it is worth:
---
https://noobinnullsec.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ratting_guide_basic.jpg
---
If your DPS is high, do more systems.
---
Never get too comfortable, I did a while ago thinking this "empty" spot of lowsec was safe, it was not
---
That's my point, it would have been easier to link 5 kills than bend zkill into showing 5 kills over a 2 week period by picking the 15-30 period the ships died it. The guy turned 2+2 into a fucking calculus equation.
---
So I think the game has 3 major issues that need to be addressed. 
---
1st issue is the gap between new players and old players is massive, like years and years massive. Even with injectors there is just no way to get 80 million skill points in a reasonable amount of time unless they are wealthy and have disposable income. The problem with this is the new players cant really partake against the old players (caps vs subcaps issue &amp; titans)
---
2nd issue is the pvp play ability factory (made worse with subcap vs cap). Not enough pvp battles because of 1st issue and 2nd issue is that old players pvp losses don't mean anything because of how much isk they have, vs new players where the ship destruction is painfull. I remember losing my 1st battleship in a level 4 mission, not fun even with insurance because of my modules was the same cost as the battleship. and running level 4s as a mediocre raven pilot, took me 3+ hours to make back my lost modules. so new players vs old players have a disposable isk problem.  new players have none, old players have 100x too much isk. game isnt fun for new or skilled players because of this. 
---
3rd issue is the whole dropping cynos everywhere and massive FU to anyone that attempts to have any fun, they just get curb stopped by superman dropping in from heaven while your just trying to mug a 7-11 for some pvp fun. boom 30 titans or 30 caps or 30 whatevers. There needs to be better cyno inhibitor options with special only ships that can drop and activate them. (3 inhibs at different sizes with 100km, 500km, 1000km) range and only special ships can deploy/anchor/activate. like a bs cov ops can do the 1000km inhib but can only hold 3 in cargo and can only be fitted while docked in a station (think cyno cargo hold like a drone hold, but not scoopable). If the ship(owner) ever leaves the cyno inhib range, the deployable self destructs to prevent abuse, and cant have more than 1 inhib in the inhib range. 
---
So fixes would be that i would propose. In order to get more small fights, you need to LOWER the bar for pain so that in cheaper / smaller /t1 ships, losses dont matter so much. As the ships get bigger and more expensive, the cost goes exponential (to a degree). So for NEW players and their weaker ships, insurance is 50% default free. They can go higher but it only cost a little bit more. So losses dont hurt as a newbie as much as they do now. You lower the bar for new players and their cheaper ships so they can pvp more often more frequently and not have to go back to PVE grinding as often. Only until you get advanced enough tech 2 tech 3 caps insurance doesnt really pay as well. More skilled players are going to feel the pain more, insurance isn't going to help, skills cost more and ships cost more. Caps and beyond need to cost like 2x more, and same with skills. Rorqs need some sort of nerf. Basicaly tip the scale so that cheaper builds and ships are encouraged to pvp and while you can pick to use your huge massive ship if you want, it needs to have more risk. Losing a titan should hurt. Right now people can lose their dread 100x times before they need to go back to PVE grinding. yet a newbie in their first battleship has to go back to running missions or killing rats for 3 hours before they can cover PART of their battleship. They aint gonna be doing any pvp anytime soon, and if they do with a smaller ship like a battlecruiser, still can only die 3 or 4 times before going back to the grind stone. 
---
Not to mention game needs a re-balance pass... and thats about as much time as i want to spend on this comment. 
---
&gt; enemies will naturally hunt each other to extinction
---
Why would they do that? Even Goons were allowed to survive in Delve (and look what happened to them). Even Dead Coalition was allowed to survive in Deklein, to use a bit more recent example.
---
There is no way im gonna pay for 3 accounts the fucking alt meta is bullshit. And without it you are clearly in a disadvantage. Its way to easy to say "bruhhh just plex thos alts" idunno where ppl get thier trillions of isk but progress is slow as fuck and not rewarding at all.
---
