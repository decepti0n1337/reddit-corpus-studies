I can't see them claiming to be Triglavian anywhere...

How would you classify the CSM as a failure? Who knows what changes they have advocated for or, more importantly, advocated heavily against. To call CSM's from the past failures, seems unnecessarily cynical.

Do I get mod too so people can still get us confused

It's not even that ccp should see bots easy their activity gives 5hem away no talking on from dt to dt and so on ccp should be able to find most bots just by running db queues for login off times and activities ie 23/7 ratting.
---
The tired refrain of the carebear. A variety of playstyles may be possible in the sandbox but they are not equally worthy of merit. The hunter is better than the krab in the same way that the wolf is better than the sheep. And before you retort that krabs are necessary to the economy, I will remind you that krabs exist in near unlimited supply and that the economy thrives on destruction.

He dealt with it personally. That's leadership.

"Fix" means whatever definition I give it in this case, and I dont think I have given one yet.
---
Removal would of course be the most correct "fix", but there is a range of things that could be changed to make them manageable from a sustainability standpoint. What are the current proposals for injector fixes?

This is bullshit imho and why no major invasions happened and will probably happens since even bazck to the dominion sovs you couldn't spam as many outposts as you wanted in the same system.

Guess he finally got bored of forums and decided reddit was a better place to shitpost
---
&gt; Other than the fact that CCP said I didn’t.
---
Because CCP would definitely say things like "we actually had a standard amount of evidence we apply to anyone else, but we are threatened with court so we will apply higher standards to this case".
---
They seem to be inseparable from "useless". This would mostly be because CCP dont care, but the result is the same.
---
CSM is a filter and shields CCP from the community. They should have to deal with us directly.
---
Cool story.

Im using it correctly.

What are the proposed injector fixes?

No, the triglavians are Peruna Clade \[CLPER\], Svarov Clade \[CLSVA\] and Velesian Clade \[CLVEL\].

---
I just meant the illness is not their fault.
---
The word illness came to be used to indicate this is the sort of thing that's nobody's fault and that could have happened to anyone. Also to motivate employers etc to be considerate about the conditions. 
---
Now the word is irking some overly sensitive people who'd like to claim these conditions are normal. There are always people who take their rightful social justice claims too far (particularly a trend in US). You can't claim that a mental illness is not an illness yet ask for a sick day for it.
---
People have all kinds of bodily or mental flaws. It's not like there is nothing bad or out of ordinary with these flaws. A mental illness is just that, an illness.

In your words: "I will fight these false allegations, restore my reputation and seek all avenues for recourse available to me for these reckless actions."
---
&gt;  I have never given anyone any reason to distrust me. I have always been honest and forthright with everybody.
---
I always pointed out you are still one of the better CSMs even in those recent posts. My default position vs null affiliated CSMs is distrust. I think it's a rational position. Has nothing to do with you.
---
Imagine if no one ran, and no one voted.
---
you are australian timezone right?  that doesn't count.
---
What theory? It's a fact that a Molok was sold right before it was nerfed, not a theory.

Many times when things boil down to coincidence vs. orchestration, it's more rational to choose to believe the latter.

Bye Felicia

Thanks for the new recruitment pitch bois

There is really no reason to stick around. 
---
Like almost nobody running wormhole sites will stick around if a new sig pops, they're often forced to because dreads and points are things.
---
Now the big issue is that isn't gonna work for nullsec because of the ability to quick and limitlessly re-enforce a trapped ratter.
---
He isn't implying they do.
---
He's saying CCP is pants-on-head retarded, and assuming CSM will be able to do any real good is a waste of time. CCP just uses it as an excuse they can point to when players say they don't listen.
---
Time to get rid of that excuse. Demolish the CSM and leverage subs to force CCP into being more transparent and open with the direction they're going for the game.
---
&gt;most powerful russian alliance
---
to be honest, the bar is set pretty low I think you could do it
---
Gotta Say the vid makes you look like a chill group :)
---
&gt; You started by accusing the CSM of actual employee layoffs and departures, as if they could possibly have any agency over shit like that.
---
Do, he didn't. He used that an example of how incompetent CCP is. If they can't even keep their house in order, why would you possibly think they'd allow the CSM to do any good?
---
At this point, CSM is just an excuse CCP can point to when players say they aren't listening to player feedback. It's doing more harm than good.
---
Praise James! You can tell the caliber of person by their reaction to this video. Negative =&gt; Trash. It's like some kind of litmus test for Goofuses!
---
No, and it's pretty obvious you just want to shit on people in null who don't play the way you play. I'll just leave you to it.
---
He's PL's only good poster, solid add.
---
Isn’t a selling point of Eve that battleships can’t operate against frigates without support? Just make leshak fleets need a couple Kiki’s or hyenas, and not too much will change.
---
&gt; We know the Trigs are related to the Jove 2nd empire in some way.
---
Related, as in they had interactions with the Second Jove Empire, but not necessarily an offshoot of it. It's more likely that the Triglavians are a separate ancient civilization altogether that interacted with the Second Jove Empire in the past, and deemed it as the 'Ancient Enemy Azdaja' through some sort of conflict.
---
I don't understand any of those losses... my god.

Before citadels nearly everything was stored in invincible npc stations. Not much of a difference

Post a video of a leshak killing an orbiting stiletto. Do it.

Overall game speed velocity needs a nerf, so I could see how Trig tracking needs a bit of nerf after everything slows down 5-10%

I think we can all agree that triglavian ships ate a bit strong right now. this is to be expected with a new ship type and a new skill tree. Adapt first and be rewarded.

however a drek tracking a ceptor (im assuming without drugs cause its good for my arguement) burning at 30-60 degrees is just fuckt up. This shit has to be able to be tackled for the game to work.

&gt;I have been playing since 2003 and have countless hours played on this game. I have FCed for many well known alliances such as BoB and other major alliances. I have won countless battles as well in my EVE career.
---
Don't bother asking, by making such a clam it likely that CCP will require him to run using this character as claiming to be an FC in a notable alliance would probably be considered an character with a reputation.
---
We will see then what the truth is. 
---
I personally doubt he is even really running.
---
The guy was legit begging me, it was mildly creepy.
---
I hope it's yes, I like your posts more than I don't.

As it turns out you can't afk-orbit every ship in the game in a Stiletto and expect to survive.

Today our universe's destruction has been averted in defiance of our very makers!

post video of the ceptor's pov with angular velocity on OV and we can talk. if he's pressing orbit don't bother btw.

Like I said, they were never threatened with a lawsuit. What I wrote there was not a legal threat by any stretch of the imagination.

i thought it was a 1 month break while ASP works on finals
---
And all the war dec spam that makes it impossible to JC to high sec and do anything
---
All the F1 monkeys immediately piling in with their waaaa battleship should kill everything and talking about afk orbiting lol.
---
A little scary sometimes how many people know so little about piloting outside of clicking f1 on broadcasted targets.
---
I think the small and medium triglavian guns need a small tracking nerf. The issue is the combination of range and tracking, the tracking is actually similar to blasters but when combined with the range you end up with essentially perfect tracking which is a little ridiculous. For example the Kiki is essentially untackleable in pretty much any frig without them eating a dick in 10 seconds.
---
oof
---
As someone who enjoyed profiting from all the salvage: 
---
BOOOOOO! BOOO! FEED MORE FEROXES!
---
No. Even if this were a problem, your post wouldn't tell me about it. You have linked no video, no kb stats, no kb losses/kills, no pyfa stats, or anything for that matter. If your piloting is anything like your posting, I can only conclude that you died while hitting approach.

It’s not a question of choosing who to ‘shaft.’ It would actually be easier to do a mass test that includes AUTZ than USTZ, because of the way time zones work. AUTZ is morning EUTZ, so they could theoretically do it at the start of the workday instead, but USTZ is late evening/night EUTZ, meaning everyone has gone home.

So balanced now, just run abyssal sites and stop Rorq mining,  the capital age is over welcome the new age of one faction to rule them all.

---
trig ships are a bit strong atm but its probably justified given:
---
1. their price. fittings + skillbooks is easily 2b+ for t2 guns
---
2. the lack of effective anti-cap counterplay in small numbers. the agility and dps of trig ships promote more small gang hit-and-run warfare, which is probably positive for the game as a whole
---
trig ships need to be toned down - but not so much that their price no long justifies their use

It’s not fucking hard.  But then all the RMT people would get gud and stop leaving obvious things like killing the same stupid shit that tops killboard.
---
It’s really easy to hide isk transactions from CCP. Look at all the RmT people with possibly deniability. And thats the hard thing with alts. 
---
CCP left a really easy mechanic in place that keeps the recipient anonymous. BUT you gotta be smarter than an RMTer to do it.
---
Straight up 100% of the spys who try and get in will get in. Fuck it. You just gotta setup your corp the right way so they wouldn’t be able to do harm.
---
Also TBH you either love MCAV cavalry or you fucking hate MCAV Cavalry. And I doubt anybody who hates us is gonna wanna stick around long enough to be able to do anything. We’re gonna shot you when we get bored 100% and we’ll definitely roll out blues for the fuck of it. Hell, a few of our members have been known to ecm the AFk miners we’re using as bait just to keep everybody paranoid.

ill kill you. just tell me where you live ^^^^^^^^in-game

Went on? I made a single, accurate comment. Risk-averse describes a pattern of behavior. Carebear is basically synonymous so maybe it was a redundant statement, albeit, used as a more derogatory label. You were the one flat out calling people whiners with no real substantial argument to the point. This thread has several points I've put forward about why I think it is a good idea. So tell me again about the irony of my statement

I've stopped solo roaming Gem because if you can catch it, it's probably bait. There's a cool little rhythm in this. 
---
"Bots'n'bait, all that's left in Geminate."
---
Realizing this really upset me, because as a good citizen of the north, I always considered most of the north "above" cheating, unlike those rawrrrrrrrr goons. However, Gem, Vale and the Kav Ex are every bit as bad as Fountain in terms of entering a system, running a probe sweep, and seeing up to half a dozen VNIs in anoms with their drones already recalled - even though you are off intel.
---
This is my favorite, easy, almost certain "that's a bot" tell. Get off intel in a T3 with a probe launcher (logout/login often is the best). Enter a bot system. Run a probe scan. If you get cruisers in anoms with no drones out, nearly every time, you've found a bot. Remember, drones take time to recall, meaning to have them off grid before a 6s scan completes, they need to be recalled pretty much right when you are pressing "analyze".

I would think putting all items in one contract would be more efficient than right click -&gt; deliver for every single item

That would mean something if anyone used it.

Honestly spend some time hunting and you will see right clicking stuff to dscan it would be incredibly slow. It is fiddly sometimes and requires a double click. Once proficient you can find ships in a couple of seconds.

Thats not CCP. Squizz wont change the values as killmails dont show how many fighters were killed. That is what you need CCP to add.

Any non shit tier alliance can form enough to push off a kikifleet in 10 minutes. Take into consideration that there should’ve been a standing fleet up with people in it and it’s only small or terrible alliances that can’t save a properly fit rorq.

Or they can not mess with everyone’s schedules for the sake of getting a few extra people in the test.
---
It should last a while, large alliances don’t usually double cross other large alliances, at least not without an excuse. So, I don’t expect this to fall apart unless either citadel tax mechanics change or if one side if the the Legacy/WinterCo + Panfam war starts actually getting close to evicting the other, at which point being trustworthy will ultimately become secondary to either surviving or having the chance to finish off or severely weaken a significant enemy.

---
the reason sort's sketchiness is so notable is because coalition leaders who don't keep their word are so rare it's hard to think of another example
---
it's less about being honorable than about the golden rule - if a coalition's leadership can't be trusted not to randomly backstab those who agree to peace with them, no one would agree to anything with them in the first place
---
thus, the rather odd position sort has found himself in now - i digress - he still has a NIP with pl and nc, afaik, but the biggest thing keeping him from being evicted is the fact that no one can be bothered to alarm clock every day to entosis and bash zillions of structures in autz against the strongest autz coalition in the game
---
Because they said you have to? Other that that the whole story does not look very trustworthy.
---
having attended several of the fights, both with pl and with my horde alt, i can tell you:
---
brawling in highsec in tidi is objectively at least 30% more cancer than brawling in null in tidi
---
Isn't RTSQ strictly a gatecamping corp?
---
isk sink margins (broker's fees) are lower on player structures than on npc stations. for high-volume traders of items like plex and mct certificates, it makes zero sense not to use an offshoring structure
---
the kiki has similar tracking to an autocannon thrasher with 48km optimal
---
it desperately needs a nerf to either range or tracking imo and i'm one of the biggest proponents of its use. its damage is also conspicuously strong, considering that the drekavac, ostensibly a larger, more powerful ship overall, only barely does more damage
---
But then comes all the other shit and drama that follows. Like rise in plex and injectors etc.  If we didnt have it the n it wouldn't matter just like before when citadels didnt exist
---
As always , CEO of x-files consider themselves the best one. But they get kicked from Tests because they are fucking crabs, also because they cant communicate with 2 another ru corps in tests.

No logic.  why should players be put through all this when the simple answer is we dont need to use player owned citadels when We had a perfectly good market in Jita . Why should we let others profit from it.  Yes jita market can be manipulated but this is just another level or complexity and drama we dont need.  When stuff like this is happening simple answer is boycott them.
---
But lets see what happens because as you say it does have benefits too.

I've two related questions. First, do starbases still work? The information I could find online changes so much depending on when it was posted that it's impossible to find out what it's like currently. Specifically, I wanna know if the Compression Array and the Research Laboratory still work.
---
Second question is, if yes, starbases still work, can I anchor them in "starter systems" where upwell structures can't be anchored? Namely the systems listed in this article: https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203209712-Rookie-Griefing

TBH: best I can tell TTT is a structure designed to market fuck test members. Whenever I needed a mod they were at like 3x jita at least. Jita 4-4 is better if you are buying anything besides plex and injectors.
---
I’m always surprised why people start freaking out so hard when told that trig ships are oppressive. It is objectively true that trig ships are way to strong, you can just go to pyfa and compare. They have everything better than their equivalents: better tank, better speed, better tracking, better range, better damage, more utility, better fitting space, more slots, better agility, lower mass, better drone bay. Ccp put themselves in a position where they can’t even give them rigs without breaking the game. The combination of tracking, speed and utility in particular makes them way to strong against tackle for their class. Kikis, dreks and vedmaks can just eat ceptors without having to change direction. The wrecking shot mechanic adds up to the constant damage and randomly deletes small stuff in one shot. Somehow people in this thread talk about dumb ceptors orbiting and getting good which is hilarious because the Kiki and the drek are the ones that doesn’t have to put in any effort to kill them. You can’t whine about supers being to oppressive and think trig ships have sustainable stats in the long run for this game. It’s just sad that ccp keeps adding new overpowered stuff like invulnerability modules and trig ships instead of actually balancing the game.
---
Well, ofc an omen navy will force off a kiki, i think the problem that people have is that the kiki is very good at dealing with kite ships in it's own shipclass and below.
---
I would argue though that that is not a a bad thing, considering how important specialization is in the smallgang meta.
---
 And i don't know all too much about brawl match ups, but i'd imagine that the kiki gets outbrawled in most scenarios.
---
And if darkness decides to drop a HS keepstar I will be completely willing to alarm clock to help blob it out of existence.

You probably suck at your job too.  How bout this attention?  Are you digging it?  When can we look forward to your next desperate cry for attention?

1. They still work in some functions, but the compression arrays and research lab do not, you need a citadel fit for reprocessing and research respectively for those.

2. No, starter systems disallow POSs being anchored afik. You can always check the moons, if none of them have a dead stick you will know for certain.

Delete highsec citadels for the good of the game.

A communist Eve corp is shared corp hangars, a normal tax rate and the means of production are owned by the corp and used for the good of the whole.
---
There will either be handout ships for pvp and/or some kind of scheme where everyone takes what they need and give what they are able to.
---
It’s a common misconception that communism means no money, a 100% tax rate or that your house or car gets taken away, because those are personal property, not private property, which are the means of production, private companies or a rich person’s extra houses or mansions.
---
That being said, The Collective was full communist in the early 2003-05 Stain Alliance days. The players added their BPOs to the corp pool and the whole corp mined together for the corp to supply members with ships for war.
---
The corp hangars were “take what you need, give what you are able to” and this whole scheme was actually very nice while it lasted but fizzled out over a couple years due to inactive leadership after the alliance’s nemesis Curse Alliance disbanded.
---
More important change to dscan QOL is probably "don't dscan automatically after changing angle/distance".
---
Well, that's kind of the main point of perimeter offshore market
---
You ever been on zkillboarddotcom?
---
Thanks. If compression array and lab don't work anyway, that pretty much takes away any reason I might've had for using one. A Citadel is out of question since even though I can afford one, I play solo and that means as soon as I anchor it, about seventeen different gank corps will wardec me :(

The DED 9/10 for every race just doesn’t seem worth running. It’s difficult, time consuming, and the loot is worse than what you receive from a common 10/10. I remember running one in Delve for curiosity sake and it took me like 2 hours in travel time. I dropped my Nyx on the final structure and got a pimpin’ 19th tier overseers affects, all in. God bless, CCP.
---
If we really wanted to make the 9/10 great again (think 6/10), it should have something unique in the loot table. The 9/10 is in an unusual spot - it’s technically a rated DED but has all the features of an unrated escalation complex - so I think it makes sense to give it a special loot table. 
---
TL;DL - it’s a pain in the ass and needs to drop something unique to stand out.

The Kikimora is a destroyer, it is designed to shit on frigates and does so handsomely. A good pvp fit cruiser (not talking about bears in their VNI's) should have no problems with a destroyer 1 v 1 and will be able to take the Kikimora on (it's sig is quite large with MWD on), I see no problem here.
---
The Vedmak has tracking bonus but suffers for it by not having the range. Vedmaks are not used enough outside abyssal PVP to be an issue and the Drekavac/Leshak cannot track a well flown frigate. Still no problem.
---
So yes, the Kiki is very strong, nobody denies that, but nerfing a destroyers anti frigate role is dumb. And for the anti frigate role you can pick any T3D (let's say Jackdaw) for a third of the price and murder frigate size ships to your hearts content. The on thing the Kikimora does break is faction warfare meta being technically a T1 destroyer (should be a classed as a T3D really), since it cannot meet T3D's and above in small plexes it is completely safe unless ganked.

Feeding capitals and frigates into a doctrine designed to kill capitals and frigates is clearly not the problem here. It must be the ships. If only ships existed which were designed to kill destroyers....
---
   
---
this is fake TIepecBeT this is not overexposure
---
That’s pretty awesome! I’ve always heard great things about wormholing, but have never experienced it. It’s something I’d love to try.
---
&gt;PL  NC.  
---
Due to the recruitment standards unlikely.
---
I'm not saying to make it useless in an anti-frigate role, a small nerf would still make it amazingly effective but bring it's power level down to where it's more manageable.
---
Another issue with the Kikimora is speed, it's faster than pretty much every cruiser out there at 2,949m/s cold in a standard shield kite fit. Only the insanely fast cruisers like the Cynabal and Orthrus can barely keep up. The big thing with other destroyers is that despite their effectiveness against frigates, they are slow and can easily be run down by cruisers (just like the Jackdaw you gave as an example). That's basically the definition of a destroyer in Eve, shred frigates, get run down by cruisers if you're not careful.
---
The Vedmak/Drekavac/Leshak is a whole other issue, I would say none of them need tracking nerfs, and perhaps the Vedmak needs a fitting buff or something kind of other change as right now it's quite weak.

A plan between high-sec and null-sec to invade low-sec :)

Mostly rats TBH and never outside null or J-space. Even if that's not the biggest money, the gear needed is cheap, not very skill intensive, and risk free.

Nah man, dont insult fuckwits like that.
---
Asset safety it to closest lowsec station. Its a 20 day wait but better than losing the stuff.
---
Short answer is nothing, it will remain in your hangers.  You could trigger asset safety to get it out to the nearest low sec (for a fee) or risk flying it out.
---
I thought the new mango alliance will play that role... botting aka npc checked, chinese vs the world checked, hey they can even use triglavian ships to fit your narrative better.
---
What you’re describing is physically possible, but still breaking the rules. Just making sure you’re aware.
---
Or just sell it there on public contracts and buy replacements in your new home.
---
You can put a cargo container behind pos Shields that only you and your alts have access to. I used to do this for pi. Worked really well. You have to trust your CEO and directors, unless of course you are the CEO
---
On average, 10.5
---
Can you give examples?

Then why are you still posting here?
---
That would work in a universe where EVE pilots still had teeth!
---
Now the Triglavians will waltz all over New Eden and there’s nothing anybody can do that will stop them?
---
Where is Rooks &amp; Kings when you need them?
---
Do people refer to afkers as bots or are you guys actually talking about real bots, objects in memory mapped or bots not even requireing a client by using eves own network protocol? 
---
Trying to solve an issue that you have no clue about, will get you nowhere
---
I would sell it if I were you.  It'll probably get you more than after the asset safety tax, and you won't have to move it around low to get it out.  There are usually badgers around in nullsec regions who'll buy it cheap just to get your icon out of local.
---
I've only once had a kitchen when I've been at a summit. (That was the time there were booking issues and we ended up being in seperate AirBnBs. I lucked out and got a nice flat. some people were less lucky)

Most of the time, it's a regular Reykjavik hotel room.
---
the finish is pretty terrible tbh
---
Oh no! Someone might be making a profit in the game by having the most expensive asset in the game placed in the most contested location in the game.... in a game about space capitalism. Someone has to put a stop to it.
---
Real question, why are you asking r/eve instead of your corpmates?
---
Its how the Astero bots operate where I am, get a relic, get the loot, warp to a red citadel and asset safety it. You can see the many many contracts from lowsec to other characters to collect the loot.
---
Imagine not having refits ready before fleet. You played yourself.
---
Be better.

Just put it up for public courier contract

---

---
If you feel like it’s wrong you could point out where. Just insinuating it doesn’t make it real. If you want facts, here are some: The Kiki can just sit 0ms and perfectly track a stiletto going 4km/s with perfect transversal. A drekevac has double the tracking of an omen navy issue that is the reference as a solid gun based anti tackle. The leshak tracks better than an ac mach or a nightmare that are already extremely strong against anything trying to rely on sig and speed tank. That’s before all the other advantages these ships get against tackle specifically (neut bonus, slot for defensive web, speed, agility) and in general (damage, tank...). You have to be really blind both in theory and in practice to not see how over the board trig ships are.
---
No, station trading.
---
Regional trading would require me to actually undock!!
---
delete you for the good of the game
---
This looks like my Moa after running through Geminate for an hour.
---
So you mean triglavian incursions but in regional scale and being smarter? The community will find solutions in time. For example: if you have ever joined an incursion fleet, you know the cap chain and brodcasting, tagging and using AAA as meatshield in tcrc. And there will be new groups instead of big alliances forming coalitions. Cool idea tho
---
For alliances like these 400bn is peanuts lets not try make this more than that.  They are not doing it for us,  they are doing it to have more of a monopoly and control over the game (which is not good) and of course make shit loads of profit.  So boohoo if you do like my comment.
---
Clearly you've missed my point entirely, but I'm not going to explain any further.

there is some stuff in the client suggesting we might get sleepers as a playable race, and capsuleers siding with sleepers would make sense if the triangle people turn out to not like us.
---
i'm not sure how old the sleeper bloodline stuff is tho, maybe the hoboleaks guy knows
---
I won´t disagree with any of that tbh.
---
Vily has returned from Geminate with peace for our time.
---
The question is a valid one.
---
If you asked your corp, they could tell you:
---
1. If you have a transitional grace period where you have been left blue to remove assets, and what the duration of this period is.
---
2. If you are changing alliance but will still be blue, so will still have docking rights.
---
3. Any bulk sale asset disposal agreements your corp has reached with the alliance to get rid of things you don't want to move with you.
---
You won't find answers to any of these questions on Reddit.

Actually quite useful middle management. They started in the Pure Blind/Fade days as the group that pioneered the RQH pocket, added ADM-maintenance duties and from there have assumed more and more duties. They get shit done.
---
ISK efficiency matters if you are doing the activity to fund something you'd really rather be doing, like PvP. But yeah, if you like to run DED sites go for it, agreed.
---
That's... not proof at all? There are already Jove and drifter characters in game, as in, NPCs using the specific character models. This could just be that, instead of suggesting a completely new player race.
---
In what way is it good? Less fights, higher taxes.

I don't get how this wasn't thought of while designing the structures.

I'm not so sure about that

Oh no...space aids!

---
Remember (and not as a direct refutation of your point) that Trig guns don’t get falloff at all, and lose ramp if they have to switch ammo type. Vs trig guns part of the equation that is much more important than vs other guns is range control to force ramp resets/bait closer ranged ammo change before pulling range again.
---
Hungry. That's a solid feeling when confused.
---
See Zach... 99% of eve goes through this cycle. I also "had fun playing eve" in the same situation and stayed in a corp for way too long because my "elite ceo" (in my case he was taking a break from null) let me borrow a 20 million covetor to get my mining tax. At least we had orca boosts!
---
When did it stop getting fun? when i got my T2 mining lasers and realized that was the shitty goal i spent 60 days training for. 
---
I dont expect OP to listen to me... what im doing is providing a reference point for the inevitable epiphany they will have when they decide to quit.

They can quit... or remember that "assholes" post and possibly stick around.

---
Having tracking of blasters, with range of rails is normal.
---
Move along folks, nothing to see here.
---
There still would be a period of times where multiple fleets will get whelped, when mechanics won't be 100% understood like what happened when incursions came out. It would probably be quite fun, for a time.
---
Just going to respond to a few of your points.
---
Better range &lt;- they have no long ranged fleet weapon option, and as long range volley guns have ever been the meta for larger groups, this constrains trig ships to very much a smaller gang role only, outside of whaling or other specialist applications.
---
Better fitting &lt;- for drek agreed, for ved/lesh, not really - still have to make lots of trade offs on rigs/fitting mods/other slots to not use undersized utility highs (Ved especially would benefit with a bit of fitting love, but we’ll see if this is addressed when the VedHAC comes out).
---
Conversely, to their detriment, trig damage is much more affected by ewar (a point you didn’t note).
---
In brawl meta, pimp lesh will lose to pimp rattle or pimp bhaal (askleps/crystals and complex tank w/ drugs). This is to a large degree maintained as you drop the fit prices, though leshak becomes more competitive because of high basic dps at peak ramp. So while strong vs most other tank and spank hulls, they are not without counters. The triple rep bhaal is probably the single strongest 1v1 BS.
---
In fleet meta the leshak is irrelevant beyond 70k.
---
The drekavac does have some poorly chosen stats - but not any of those you mentioned - it’s too light. It basically masses the same as the vedmak, and less than a sacrilege. Meanwhile the rhodiva and zarmazd are up massing near a typical BC at around 14m. 
---
Drek perhaps should mass 12-12.5m, making it about as heavy as the heaviest cruiser, and maintaining the racial lighter mass than ordinary empire hulls (BC are around 14.5 typically), while rhodiva and zarm should drop 2-3m kg mass to bring them in line with typical cruisers. This might achieve some of the tune down you believe the hull needs.
---
&gt;Dual nestor + leshak in C5 :)
---
leshak dont get aggroed?
---
Again, I do not necessarily disagree with you; however, whether or not someone is lazy is not the point. Rather, the point is that CCP knows that it is a fact people do not move their shit to NPC stations when they take a break from eve and are part of a null sec alliance, and they know for a fact that if people in null sec alliances were to lose all their shit when the upwell structure they base out of pops, they won't base out of upwell structures. 
---
That's just a fact, supported by data... and it is also a fact that eve players who lose all of their shit in one go are very likely to quit the game and never come back.
---
Finally, like I said, *since CCP is a capitalist entity whose aim, desire, and purpose is to make money* the asset safety game mechanic exists, and will continue to exist, because if CCP removed it they would ultimately lose subscriptions.
---

you are a null sec FC's wet dream.  Your idea of winning at pvp is shooting at defenseless structures.  If i had 50 of you, several ops every night, and a few months, we could clear out a region of structures.
---
I mean, your example literally happens all the time.
---
How come every FC thinks it's better to repeat an order 10 times at 10 times speed instead of maybe twice at normal speed? I don't need to hear you ten times, I need to hear you once, but clearly.
---
Ill upvote. Not a bad idea to add to the game.
---
If you want to hurt bots you have to make it harder for bots to make isk while not increasing the difficulty of everybody else.  If you increase the difficulty across the board, nobody is worse off.  If you increase the difficulty across the board by forcing pilots to make a bunch of additional clicks of their mouse, botters will rejoice since they don't give a fuck about mindless input while it drives their competition (active ratters) out of buisness.
---
Just a thought, with the borders around the teams at the bottom of the screen, could they be set up as Red and Blue to corrospond to their respective icons?

z was needed to have ships organized in right order. i'm sure you knew that.

true story bro

Yup. They need to start automating the bot killing process with a multi staged detection script. Wouldn't take long to implement in any sane environment, few hours.

Ahh so even more bonuses for the defenders... as if it isn’t already hard enough to invade a region in 2019

i'm stupid and don't see it , anyone explain ?

Haha thanks man. Yeah I get his point, if I get bored I understand that there's a whole different side of eve I haven't touched yet. I'm happy where I am so I'll keep doing the stuff I'm doing and continue to try new things.

---
Evolution (SirMolle's corp) is still commie as far as I know, they're in NC.
---
Working class people try to make money, OP tries to put them into shame by insulting them.
---
Nerf \_SOMETHING\_. The Kiki and the Drekavac are just absurd. The kiki's INITIAL dps is fucking absurd, the tracking near perfect, and then you have the ramping capability. It's by far the worst offender, but the Drek is mostly a giant kiki.
---
Your initial DPS is still higher than any comparably ranged weapon. Once you ramp up even a few ticks it gets ridiculous. Don't think about max ramp up, you don't need to.
---
In their initial statement they said they would be investigating further.
---
The thing that blows my mind about EVE is that players are a bunch of cunts to CCP and then can't figure out why the game isn't moving in a direction they agree with.
---
Devs don't respect toxic fans.
---
It's so clearly evidenced in this whole thing that the entire community has been waiting to throw their feces at CCP since it started. If you're that excited to shit on the devs, maybe you shoundt play the game anymore.
---
The months leading up to CCP's sale to another company
---
Penif is bae, Penif is life.
---
Tapi is no better than kids with guns.
---
A man of culture.
---
Does this bonus defenders or attackers? If you destroy the proposed structure, you'd be able to move essentially undetected (except by dscan), no?
---
How does a cruiser engage a kikimora? Nano kiki has choice of engagements against most things. There is almost nothing that can catch it that doesn't immediately get hazed.
---
It doesn't need a huge nerf to make it ineffective against frigs. Frankly for the kiki I wouldn't touch the tracking at all but go after the initial DPS and make it rely a bit more on ramping. The \_INITIAL\_ fucking DPS keeps up with every other destroyer in the game barring gank catalysts and shit. The ramped dps is so high people have started using them to kill caps in small gangs.
---
Bring it in line with the rest of the game, because cost to power scaling needs to stay logarithmic, and the kiki is almost linear.
---
So you want defenders to have access to local, but not attackers? Because the odds of these being knocked out other than in full-on main line offensives would be small. These wouldn't be something, even if they were as weak as bridges, that small gangs just came in and knocked out to facilitate their roam.
---
Don't forget that its initial DPS is also similar to an autocannon thrasher. Fuck the rampup. Nerfing range would be a solution, nerfing initial damage somewhat would be another.
---
But only the owners would be able to see local normally? Imagine roaming around any region of nullsec that isn’t in the middle of a war. Also it’s much easier to defend a structure than it is to attack it considering you’ll be under your own super umbrella, reship faster, etc
---
Discord doesn't (... still) either, unfortunately.
---
People don’t even use TTT. Jita 4-4 is far more reliable and better prices.
---
My hands are clean...
---
No, The Imperium was taken down from the inside. Jared Dale Hauling snuck in 5 Tristans and 2 VNI's under the guise of a Wizard hat shipment, and Lumio managed sneak in and take out all Imperium structures overnight. Causing a Rorqual riot.
---
Due to the Rorqual population outweighing the Imperium's combat-capable bee's, everything fell apart in a day.
---
We're all moving over To Senerity in an ol' swicheroo tomorrow.
---
Even with constant repeats of commands there's still tons of idiots who don't align etc and start shouting in mumble "errr where are we what we do FC?" while all the command people try to coordinate.
---
Stop pretending that we shouldn't just delete rorquals from the game
---
It wins a surprising number of them, load Occult and just nuke the shit out of things with almost Catalyst tier DPS - until you ramp up. We couldn't quite get it to 1000.
---
Brawling cruisers (with webs or a tracking bonus) all beat the kiki as you'd expect.
---
Brawling destroyers - all T1s LOSE. Yup. The kiki out brawls them with Occult DPS being that ridiculous. Command destroyers can tank long enough to kill the fragile kiki for the most part. Rocket CDs actually lose, they don't have the dps. T3s are a mixed bag, confessor actually loses because the confessor is just that fucking bad right now, shield svipul loses, armor webbing svipul wins, hecate is the only straight up "I catch you I win" ship here. Not sure how the Jackdaw fares, only dealt with fleet jackdaws so far. Kikis do \_NOT\_ fight Jackdaws if they have any kind of numbers.
---
Assault frigates actually mostly lose. You just melt the shit out of them with Occult. AC wolf can kill you if he starts in a brawl, but if you gave him a few cycles of mystic on the way in, you got him even if he saves his ADC. Enyo's trash, brawly amarr AFs aren't a thing, Jag can tackle it very quickly for a buddy but will eat shit just as fast, blarpy will eat shit, rocket hawk can't catch it.
---
Do the tracking disruption scripts work on Triglavian ships?
---
I’m so cereal right now
---
Who was that and where can I read about "their side of the situation"?
---
Time has a no refunds policy.
---
You can also create some deaddrop safespots and contract them to your alt.  Drop a jetcan at the DD safe and scoop it with your alt.  He will go flashy suspect, but you can just dock up and wait out the timer.
---
A cargo jetcan will show up on dscan but cant be probed down.  So its pretty safe to transfer items this way.  Just dont let the can time out.
---
Sounds like your main problem is needing a bigger hull, so a malestorm would be a good choice here. 
---
General rules: Artillery is for larger ships further away, autocannons are for smaller ships closer to you. Long range low dps, short range high dps. There is a good guild on the eveuniversity.
---
Try not to go into low sec until you have a grasp on how to do it in high sec AND learn how to survive in low sec using a smaller hull before you bring your shiny new ship in and get it blown up
---
Don't ask. Just make him a mod. 
---
He can begin shooting retards. 
---
We all benefit.
---
The small gang meta is going to change significantly because of the Kiki as long as the initial damage is so fucking high. Making the ramp up an actual requirement to get the good damage (as opposed to going from good to insane) is a completely valid solution.
---
Again the Drek is a smallgang problem. It's a ship that can replace the oracle for large target DPS in a nano gang while also being able to fill anti tackle. THIS IS NOT OK. I don't see why people are freaking out about the Leshak or the Vedmak. They're fine. They might be UNDERpowered unless we've completely missed something.
---
Drek needs a tracking nerf if it's going to be such a ridiculous jack of all trades. Kiki needs an initial damage nerf and possibly an overall damage nerf. Rest are fine.
---
😗
---
Please do, I appreciate many of the views you have expressed.
---
Either way, thank you for helping as much as you have.
---
Pretty much this. :)
---
Thats a top idea - thanks for reminding us :)
---
Indeed.
---
The defenders would pay for the privilege, I imagine in a full scale sov war, it wouldn't cause too much of an impact due to it being targeted first and knocked offline before any major operations.
---
Small gang roams would provide an increased amount of danger to the invaders in big systems, this could potentially be countered by allowing some sort of counter play involving dropping a mobile coms inhibitor or some other type of counter (like hacking the coms hub). Thinking about it, we always move with scouts, we'd have the same again, but the scouts would need to use D-scan a lot more instead of just looking at local.
---
They did this already with the drifter invasion and we lost hella bad so they canceled it.
---
Oh shit, that is some good info to have. I always assumed that the kiki is too fragile to brawl effectively.
---
Why so?
---
If I were a horde member I would have been ashamed long before this.
---
If only, maybe then those eagles wouldn't have died.
---
I guess the only difference between a line member in BL and a line member in TEST is the ability to push a single button better.
---
So the Bellevue Mox will be smellier than usual that day? I'll be sure to visit the Ballard one. :D
---
I am guessing changing local is a big coding deal, maybe not. But I would personally lean in the direction of giving the recon ships the ability to mount a module (cannot be used or mounted with cloak, so no turning on/off or even move cloak ability) so that the ability to not be D-scanned also means they don't show up in local until they take an aggressive action. They aren't super nimble or speedy and they aren't nullified, but it would definitely give a small gang that wanted to run 4-5 recon ships (and maybe add 1 more line of 4 ships) that were local nullified or something. The main issue and it is a BIG issue, is that local provides a lot of intel that cannot be replaced easily or without undue stress on the server. Could you imagine thousands of people spamming d-scan and doing server calls every minute of the entire day? That would be toxic to try and play spamming a button 20 times a minute all day long.
---
I mean, why would you want to lose out on ISK when the other two groups teaming up could keep you out of there?
---
uhhh, yeah?
---
Don't run a brawl fit, just dent brawlers heavily as they come in and facemelt them. The kiki doesn't _want_ to brawl, it's just so fucking good that if "caught" it will vaporize most things before it can go down.
---
Imagine the PGL telling the tackle ships to refit to a fit that was not in the wiki and used modules that were not normally used in any test doctrine. It wasn't the ferox tank fit. Also, fuck perimeter: 08 is home and I would prefer to just miss the staring at a station stratop and be in 46DP instead.

Why would people buy in Jita for a fleet?  Why would they not buy in their staging?  Is TEST that bad at keeping their market stocked?
---
Yay, another structure set to 0630 under a cyno jammer and inside DD range of a keepstar.
---
Please let me upvote this multiple times.
---
Daily reminder the old JBs used to be a bitch to camp because we put them on fucking death star poses.
---
Well there is sotiyos and keepstars about in which they can use , so I’m guessing yes , but could be wrong

Which is how communism works.

There was a drifter invasion?

Happy May Day everyone! You are all worth far more than your wages make it appear. Organize and discuss amongst your fellow workers today.

Come roam to test space USTZ, a fight counts as an extra upvote.
---
I think this proposal removes local entirely, until you build the "Communications Hub", where it would be restored like it works right now. So if it's up, it acts normally and if it's down, it acts like a wormhole.
---
&gt; even goons/Tapi/NC.co would step back, and ask help from **others coalitions**

there are other coalitions?

“Would provide local chat and intel for those added to the ACL”

That is a poor attempt at elitism.  Which we both know your not. Every human that lies about whom they are is not leet, but weak.

At 10 hours a day in a vni it takes less than 4 days to plex the account. Pretty easy.

Nope, the required upgrade for supers and titans isn't installed.

Again you are assuming the role of another. Do you even know who you are cactusjack48?

Ended up polishing it a big t more after this but I couldn't get a good photo of it before I handed it off.

You are not my mom! I do that only in EUTZ lol.
---
Unfortunately there's probably not going to be a whole lot that can be done that won't also affect players, i.e having to perform extra clicks. 
---
A person at the keyboard will have a better situational response than a bot. They can decide if it's worth it to grab the loot and bug out or if they should just warp.  A bot will more than likely be programmed to always warp. Sure they could program a bot to drop MTUs and pick them up at the end of sites, but it would be much easier to interrupt their ISK-making if they had to. 
---
For example:
---
VNI ratting is mostly
---
1. Warp at 50km
---
2. Orbit with 100mn AB
---
3. Drop drones set to aggressive
---
4. Warp out when site is done
---
Trying to snatch an MTU when someone show up in local will be very time consuming for a VNI with a 100mn AB. They either have to warp or risk getting killed. As it stands right now, they can warp and keep all of the ISK they've made to that point. No risk
---
Carrier Ratting
---
1. Warp in
---
2. Align
---
3. Drop fighters and blap
---
4. Warp when site is done
---
It's kind of hard to turn a carrier around to pick up an MTU. You could send in an alt to scoop them, but it still makes for extra work and extra time setting up another bot. Not to mention there's the chance of someone else getting to it before they pick it up. Right now they simply have to blap and collect ISK, and they can warp out when a hostile appears in local. 
---
I think actually having to pick up loot to sell(maybe a form of a bounty tag) would make it more engaging and harder to bot while only adding a small amount of extra work for an at-they-keyboard player. You'll never have a 100% perfect system that will totally get rid of bots and make players happy about not impacting them. I mean, if you asked most players they would vote to just have ISK handed to them for logging in. You're never going to get players to agree to making anything even the slightest bit harder, they'll always want it to be easier. I think it's what's best for the game though

You are focusing on a lot of things at once, most origin dudes are at least multiboxing. Repeated commands are very useful in case you miss something. That or Elo is actually a shit FC and no one has realised yet.

If you want to gatecamp form triple digit titans and a fax wall... Do you not know how many billions they spent on two gates? That's right! Two billions. That's more than your pathetic camper ass will ever see in a lifetime.

Bit far for me.

That's boring in the game's current state, and I don't have multiple hours to dedicated to idly gating around, so I'll pass on that one.

B: lmbo let me split my fleet across 2 constellations
---
Since when ? Certainly not 20 years ago when I had my 4th edition.
---
...so will you advertise your new alliance with Mobile Depots?
---
not really the point. Most people would pay 2b to a npc instead of 1b to another player for example.
---
Lmao it's a condition of working with TAPI that TAPI ceases to insult China?  
---
I predict this agreement will be hilariously short lived.

I endorse this service and/or product.

DUNK 4 CSM!
---
and while we are at it, make the same for anomalies, since we have to upgrade the ihub with module for the amount of ratting anomalies, give us the opportunity to configurate that also via ACLs, means neuts can't just warp into them, they have to use probes!
---
About f-ing time :)
---
So CCP should simplify your ganking for you because you're too lazy to split your fleet? Why stop there? Why not have CCP also murder people in real life when they get podded

Okay well it sounds like you're fucked then.

Your assets will stay there forever, until you dispose of them, or the citadel ceases to exist.
---
If the citadel is destroyed (or if you manually trigger it), your things will be asset safety'd to (a) a friendly citadel in the same system, or (b) the nearest lowsec NPC station.
---
You can alternatively sell everything. Maybe run everything through evepraisal, and knock 5-10% off the Jita price in your countract, if you want a quick sale.

So TAPI proving that yes, the game would be better if the weren't in it.

I've actually written quite a few papers on communism so I'm aware it isn't a 100% tax rate, though I couldn't think of any other way in Eve to enforce collectivization. You also sound like you're probably a communist

fuck it, id join the trigs, would be interesting shit for once

More blue please
---
I think FRT should copy these racist messages from TEST and send sses to PIBC line members. They'd definitely love it.
---
B-b-but people can still kill the occasional VNI or carrier, even though my alliance owns the space! It's not fair! Maybe if the alliance who owns the sov was able to set a toll on regional gates leading into their space or something! /s
---
Don’t know about that, but I do know that in Geminate in the spring of 2018 there wasn’t an FC in all of Horde who could bring an engagement to Elo that Elo didn’t want to take. The man can manually pilot.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
\*Slightly\* higher taxes.  A max of 0.3% vs 0.1% doesn't make a big difference.  The main thing is it's stable. Horde isn't going to be reffing the TEST structures, nor are the ICY traders going to need to move their buy-orders around as TEST kills the rogue Azbels.

CCP, killing EVE one patch at a time, and to retarded to understand what they're doing wrong.

The future is now, old man!

All trades we make involve a surplus of value. Trading our labor for wages isn’t exempt from that.
---
Go back to krabbing tard, CCP should stop making the game safer when the only reason this game still exists is because it was unforgiving.
---
flairs are image so I would be required to download them, edit in photoshop and inject the edited ones..
---
"first we have made solemn representations about TEST's previous acts of insulting China.
---
As a political premise of cooperation, we demand that TEST publicly apologize for the act of insulting China and we jointly promise not to insult any other player's nationality or race."
---
LMFAO guess the Chinese are magically no-longer a bunch of "cheating botters" now that they're blue to you eh TAPI? At least my username checks out ;)

This deserves top comment. Too bad it's buried

Do hic points stop caps from taking them, just like normal gates?
---
I actually like this idea because it'll still let you spam citadels if you really want to. You just don't get all the notifications on one screen since you'd have to create alt corporations.
---
&gt;Horde: how about we outform you?
---
Horde/Panfan wasn't really out-forming TEST+Goons in EU/US TZs, we had a bit of an edge in AU, given the current Legacy vs. Frat wars.  What we could do was ANNOY. Since Perim is 11 jumps from Geminate, we could go generate some timers at a moment's notice. And since markets/refineries shutdown if the structure goes to it's hull-timer, every armor-timer needed to be a Strat-op or CTA level form-up or else they lose face. 
---
That all said, I'm really impressed/scared that the Big Three could come to some sort of agreement on this whole deal. There's a really delicate balance of power here, and a smallish change could upset that balance.
---
I for once, wouldn't mind our new Triglavian overlords to completely ruin Delve.
---
ahahahah

publicly apologize vilyboy

Depends how fast you’ll be back ;) I know guys that go on deployment (irl military) and send a mail to the Corp leader and explain things, if not you might get afk kicked after awhile.
---
Chemex for coffee. I approve.
---
&gt; TEST is going to apologize for all anti-China propaganda
---
LUL, this will definitely go well
---
it's not my dog
---
It's not about the raw ISK war, it's about player-hours, and FC burnout.   
---
TEST High Command knew they can't effectively fight a 2-front war, and did the smart thing and brokered a deal.   
---
The real winner here is Goons, they didn't really do much aside from be a big-ass threat, and they're getting a cut just because they \*\*could\*\* take the whole thing over if they felt like it.
---
If you think this is surprising, find some info about the OTEC agreement.
---
&gt;  and a smallish change could upset that balance.

im sure it will break sooner or later, probs as soon as a war breaks out or someone does something dumb

Always baffles me that there are so many complaints on forums that could easily be rectified by those players moving space. Especially to j-space where there is _so much_ empty room and groups super keen to have new neighbours.

Bringing more numbers into this for benefit of this point and for others in thread. Considering damage at 28km (heated t2 point range):
---
Harb w/ 3 HS and HP(Scorch) = 493 gun dps
---
Harb w/ 3 HS and HB(X-ray) = 564 gun dps
---
Ferox w/ 3 MFS and 250mm(AM) = 518 gun dps
---
Brutix w/ 3 MFS and 250mm(Plutonium) = 570 gun dps
---
Drek w/ 3 RS and t2 gun(Mystic) = 339-846 gun dps, reaching 508 dps after 34s continuous fire
---
Ok, so Drek is very comparable to other medium gun platforms set up to operate in this range envelope, comparing less favourably with 2 damage mods because of the effect of RoF on ramp speed.
---
Cormorant w/ 2 MFS and 150mm(Uranium) = 211 gun dps
---
Catalyst w/ 2 MFS and 150mm(Uranium) = 193 gun dps
---
Coercer w/ 2 HS and FB(IR) = 225 gun dps
---
Kiki w/ 2 RS and t2 gun(Mystic) = 230-574 gun dps
---
Ok, so Kiki is kinda outta whack - probably needs to go to 15-20% extra damage/level instead of 25%.
---
Kinda surprised the triglavs don’t use night mode.
---
No. FW or Abyssal is more ISK
---
No, alphas are not allowed to run Level 4 missions anymore.

I conceed that its not a popular idea.

But i don't understand why there seems to be such a rejection about Sov holders having an advantage when fighting in home space? The sov mechanics aside (if you hate them, you hate them), if you have fortified an area, surely you deserve rewards for it?

Not with an aggression timer you can’t.

Even though I'm Eve retired, I still think DnG is a core part of who I am. I love those bastards. Never met such a fun bunch of people.

Some BRs from the last few months of the main fights we've had. 
---
In some we (NV) have done really well, others we've completely fed. But that's the whole point, every fight is a risk, you can always end up losing your entire fleet of blinged ships and pods.
---
because they already have so many fucking bonuses its honestly ridiculous, they need less not more.
---
Would definitely suggest leaving highsec.  Salvaging in one of the big new player friendly null sec corps is some of the best isk an alpha can make.  It also gets you involved in a corp/alliance, which if you're active will help you find lots of other things to do, fleets to join, etc.  
---
Day tripping to null or WH for exploration is pretty good as well, though riskier.
---
Can you link fits for the Drek/Oracle comparison? If you're nano-gang I'm presuming a buffer shield tank on both, which will be paper in both instances, and an engagement envelope of 30-60k? The shield tank precludes local tackle, and I'd expect that other battlecruiser hulls provide equivalent levels of damage/application, even if needing an ammo/script swap to achieve (or being RLML fit).
---
As the numbers I put in my other reply suggest, I agree the Kiki damage needs tuning down.
---
Where the sun is always shining and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long
---
It's looking like peace to me. The smaller alliances look to still be having fun, as well as smaller fights in lowsec/jspace.
---
Part of his platform will be limiting citadels to 1 per system and requiring sov. But only for SF pilots.
---
thats the point of my comment :)
---
Evereader?
---
well at this point you'll need CCP to ban us all to win, so gl.
---
I don’t want to sound like a dick here but english is my second language: Communism is the next societal step after socialism and has of course never been implemented.
---
Our (The Collective’s) implementation of space communism was like this; we did our best to keep most of our stuff in the collectivized corp hangars and did our best to only take what we needed for gangs and alliance level pvp.
---
Marx did actually coin that slogan you mentioned and the USSR reworded it into “From each according to his ability, to each according to his work”.
---
My point was more about the speed and wasn't specifically about Elo. For example everybody seems to have his own way pronouncing some system names. Add the tongue twisting high speed and sometimes you end up guessing where to align.
---
This had better end in war, drama, and a shit show. 
---
If it doesn't I'll be disappointed.
---
我大清，天下无敌
---
Just what we don't need :(
---
I recommend faction warfare, you can make decent isk doing offensive plexing and missions are even better. Also a good way to get some peeveepee
---
You already fixed it but I'll still add my own fix if someone else struggles with it.
---
I had the same issue with accounts being added but failing to start. You can actually see what happens through client startup by using LogLite, which is found in the menu right next to the minimize button. Doing so gave me the error msg "err:module:load\_builtin\_dll failed to load .so lib for builtin L\\"WLDAP32.dll\\": libldap\_r-2.4.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
---
I managed to fix it by installing the 32-bit version of libldap. Arch package: [https://www.archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86\_64/lib32-libldap/](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/lib32-libldap/) 
---
I'd be surprised if you don't find it for Debian as well.
---
I seem to remember an event (or gift) that removed skill-injector penalties. Was this a once-off or will it become common like cerebral accelerators?

 THE SANSHA'S NATION WISHES TO EXPAND ITS BORDERS, AND 9HXQ-G IS ONE OF ITS TARGETS. THEY HAVE SET UP A MAJOR BASE OF OPERATIONS IN 3GD6-8 AND ARE SLOWLY DESTROYING ALL OPPOSITION TO THEIR FORCES, WHILE THEIR PEONS BUILD THEIR NEW STARBASES. THE BIGGEST HINDRANCE TO THEIR PLANS IS IN MY-W1V. A GIGANTIC MINING COLONY, ALONG WITH A TRADING HUB, IS LOCATED THERE AND THE INHABITANTS ARE EXTREMELY AFRAID OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEM SHOULD SANSHA DECLARE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR SOLAR-SYSTEM. THEY HAVE ASSEMBLED A SIZABLE FLEET OF AMARR AND AMMATAR SHIPS TO PROTECT THEIR ASSETS, AND PREVENT THE SANSHA'S NATION FROM EXPANDING THEIR SOVEREIGNTY INTO 9HXQ-G.

test is the victim in all of this
---
how do you not see it????
---
It is preposterous to assume that the Triglavians would have an even passing interest in our pedestrian affairs.
---
TAIWAN #1!
---
This is a bug that should be fixed

Isn't that most of null?

More blueing exactly what eve needs....

The others have said what it is, I'm just here to tell you how *good* it is. A Chemex used right will make you one of the best coffees of your life and it just looks good to boot.
---
Try one out.
---
Test still going to be the punching bag of all  r/eve jokes
---
We might as well be arguing if water is wet; please just go roam nullsec and see for yourself.

Those bots are _our_ enemy and it’s everybody’s interest to get rid of them.

#TESTDoesNothingWrong
---
Woah
---
T1-T2 can be run in a caracal or pretty much any other T1 cruiser.
---
He gets extra points for pvp room ransoms on omega pilots expensive ships.
---
Ansiblexes were more than a replacement for JBs, they are meant to be player-run stargates. Hic point should stop but bubbles should have no impact. Not that I think ansiblexes should exist in the first place, but the intent was pretty clear.
---
Have you heard of NOT WARPING to the bubble?  Did you miss the bit when I said "Give Good Warpings"?  Ok.  Maybe I should have said "Pro ceptor or porber pilot to give good landing spots for warpings that don't land you on the bubble."
---
I wonder how someone in/from PL is gonna tank this candidate?
---
Why can't we anchor death star poses on jump bridges anymore? The ansiblex while pointed argument is kinda flaky, since it works like and must be defended like a gate now. It was very difficult to camp the old ones at all and impossible if the pos was manned.
---
Agreed
---
Unmanned forts don't shoot you
---
Most larger groups would already have their doctrines and tactics in place from playing through the contenet on SISI .... Remember when the FOBs came out, I beleive goons took the first one out with cheap speed tanked frigs that had been tested on SISI
---
Lol
---
Did you not think more about "smart support tackle independent flying pilots and scanner support" Will help?  Come on dude.  I know you are not that dumb.
---
Taiwan #1.
---
Nah, it’s not mine, and I realize now it’s shitty af, I’m just using The Buyout now, it’s Brave Collective aligned
---
&gt; The CSM is already basically a part-time job you do for free
---
EVE is a part time job you pay to do though
---
[Hell, it’s about time](https://youtu.be/_J6-3l3hCm0)
---
Is this site for anyone to use and contract ore to them?
---
Only because that poo was refined to minerals. New rat poo could just be j/a space blue/red loot with npc buy orders.
---
Maybe allow redeeming at ESSs for isk (that now follow upwell anchoring rules and have to be at least 1000km from anything else)?
---
&gt; Taiwan
---
idk man, i don't really see that one happening in the near future now that china is backed up by one of the largest supercapital forces and the most battle hardened alliance of new eden
---
How about because before they buffed them Pheonix using capital sized torps could be speed tanked by stations or at least POSes.
---
I think so
---
You right, what was I thinking. Fuck that guy.
---
Don't let your whole gang get stuck with aggro then. That's a misplay on your end, not unreasonable game mechanics.
---
He's in TEST of course he's gonna buy PLEX where it is cheaper and he benefits. Think before you speak
---
Also TTT has cheaper PLEX prices than Jita the vast majority of the time so a ton of people use it.
---
Not in internet spaceships, you don't.
---
Saying this will be grounds for a kick from test soon LUL
---
Is this where I insult China now?
---
I thought this was a joke about a dingus
---
Will Kick SUAD finally be actualized?!
---
XDDDDD
---
Pls use what little influence you have in snuff and drop on test more.
---
Incorrect, reactions are the true victims here.
---
Test is friend not food
---
What time is it?!
---
It's time for lunch!
---
Line up, line up...
---
Oh wait...
---
Make the Lachesis great again!
---
Exactly what I thought of.
---
Why Taiwan is clearly a independent country and not a part of china.
---
If I had a choice between working with PanFam and letting the Trigs burn everything, I'd go grab a fiddle.
---
How does one warp to the eagles without warping to the 25km bubble that they are anchored on? If you are planning to warp to a spot nearby and snipe them, A) jags are useless at that point B) remember, this is a fleet that is designed around teleporting so they will just teleport away from your harpies.
---
well now . this gave me a good laugh. oh boy china is in for some "fun"  not just from test.
---
and another one falls to the blue donut, here i was hoping they could be relevant but meh
---
Yes. I’m currently doing this with 2 alts. 1 dread. 1 with a cov ops and a crane logged off to hold the loot.
---
well we don't make anti-china propaganda so there's nothing to apologize for.
---
Forgot about that lol. Gonna listen at lunch.
---
It hurts because it's true... Though I'm still not convinced you aren't just all Dack alts.
---
Two of my buddies started this year. We discovered that the best way for them to make money as alphas was to loot battlefields in null. Almost no risk and not difficult to make hundreds of millions after a large battle if they're quick enough. Its not highsec, but if you're only risking frigates there isn't really a downside.  It can be tricky to get the loot out, but with enough patience it can be sold locally.
---
You seem like a reasonable human beeing, hope my vote helps.
---
Probably will blow up CCP's server
---
Daily reminder CCP never intended local to be an intel tool. Or for wormholes to be lived in.
---
There's no etiquette for this. The vast majority of inactives go inactive without notice.
---
Fancy pants trying to impress us with his $940 worth of EVE merch.
---
no, they have realized that this is the place capsuleers outside the flow of vyraj reside
---
not highsec  
---
not lowsec  
---
not nullsec  
---
not their mom's basement  
---
a place more cursed than the deepest depths of the abyss, not by nature's yet unsolved mysteries, but unparallelled autism and sperg
---
and they have an interest in bringing foreign augmented narodnya into the flow through propaganda by communion network infiltration
---
Day tripping into NS or WH space in a &lt;1M exploration frigate and hack relic sites.  Let me know if you have questions about fits, or how to get involved in doing that!
---
I don't get why CCP haven't done this but they should.   Could be nice little earner and clears up space and could cause some decent  pvp content.
---
What? All those probes flying about?
---
No, that's no fingers
---
It was one-off. Reportedly it was popular with the high-SP pilots, so it could come back. Nobody here can say whether it will.
---
Small gang content is what I  enjoy in EvE.
---
Some pve for isk = ships to blow up
---
That's about it
---
Just spam June 4 1989 and tank man ascii in local, the Chinese will mass disconnect from it
---
You know just as much as anyone else here.
---
Yes. Sorry I didn’t make myself clear.
---
What is the sig radius of something with no active power generation?
---
Imagine joining a game with EVE's reputation and then mining solo in highsec.
---
Spam this in local while fighting the Chinese and watch the mass disconnects
---
Fuck that. Fuck them. Let WHers fuck over their own.
---
I realise this is probably the rationale for why we can’t at the moment but then why show up on d-scan?
---
I actually wouldn't mind flying around in a salvager ship with a scanner to find wrecks and clean up space.
---
Also I agree, should only be found through probe scanner and not directional scanner as the d-scan already hammers the servers.
---
Not even they can fuck with my reddit flow
---
And the one in the left is a single cup V60 Hario.  👌
---
Yeah looks like some things got lost in translation.
---
Test Alliance Please Blue
---
we're lumpys alts...
---
so anti China sentiment gets downvoted a few weeks ago because hurr racist, but now that they're coming to our back yard it gets upvoted
---
isn't this the definition of virtue signaling?
---
Classic lumpy...
---
Dscan works on different principles, probably reflection of light or some other particle.
---
Dude it's a game,  stop it,  its not real life.. dont be a killjoy
---
I'm missing the dread right now, so thanks for the reminder.
---
 """"""""feature parity"""""""" making upwells auto attack like pos's did
---
Someone has been watching too much GoT.
---
oh shit its Te--JUNE 4th 1989--st
---
Escalation/combat site/mission runners have currently the layer of defense that by warping out or cloaking, they can hide the location of their pocket. Scanning wrecks make it trivial to get those locations.
---
Given the wreck scan change, risk/reward would balance things eventually (e.g., deadspace module price spike), but I'm not really convinced it is worth it.
---
By that logic we should be able to scan down cloaked ships.
---
CCP has already said they wouldn't mind getting rid of local.  They've put a lot of money into making it into what it is today.  I highly doubt they're going to put any effort into making their already crappy chat system anymore complicated than it already is.  Removing it all together would fix a lot of headaches.
---
Nepal #1
---
If the d-scan is able to pick it up then so should the probes and thereby triangulate?
---
Why would I be a killjoy? You seem to be making a solid attempt by yourself.
---
I'm kind of impressed.
---
Nah. They’re....err....cloaked.
---
Anyone who makes coffee like that has my vote! Mega!
---
Pretty sure there was plenty of anti-China stuff getting upvoted a few weeks ago when PIBC first announced.  I saw quite a few memes on the front page about it.
---
In theory, though the probes don't work that way, so it would require at least a modified probe.
---
Hi Frat \o :D
---
Roaming isn’t in a healthy state but it does not suck. 
---
You however may suck at roaming.
---
But they've got an active power grid, if that's what the scan probes are looking for shouldn't they find them lol.
---
Test Alliance Please Ignore... They literally said it from the start. Why are people surprised?
---
I thought you were talking about the red part that looks like a knob
---
5 Finger is propaganda and shitposts
---
SLUT MEET, a new independent dating service :P

The cloak masks the power signature.
---
[Go ahead, apologize.](https://gfycat.com/knobbyaltruisticbagworm-southpark)
---
Drop an ESS, sometimes they leave rather than give 20% bounty
---
Good luck Mr Dinkle.  You will have my vote!
---
I think CCP should be on here explaining the science of scanning and the physics of cloaking tbh.
---
Definitely, we need PowerPoints and schematics explaining this, spreadsheets too obviously.
---
How would smart and independent tackle pilot be able to effectively land on and scram a Raven fleet before it is able to boosh away, considering warp deceleration takes a minimum of 3 ticks, leaving a maximum of 4 seconds to cross 16km from a hard stop?
---
Who is dunkdinkle ??

As well as a YouTube video at least 80 minutes long

&gt; $940 worth of EVE merch
---
Was there a sale or discount or something recently!?
---
I dunno man FRT krabs are the most toxic bunch I've ran into on Eve. The translations are pure gold tho
---
That, in no way, discounts what I was saying. Hauling mass m3 and refining is magnitudes more effort &amp; complicated than taking a few coins to a coin reimburser.
---
This is your brain on spod.
---
Spod. Not even once.
---
and who are you ..... ? and why should l vote for you ...... ?
---
I’m pretty sure from our staging in Immensea I’m within 15 jumps of 11 null sec regions presuming all bridges are working. You can actually login on a notification and Burst jam almost any system in legacy space before its reffed.
---
Make Tranquility Serenity Again!
---
You can have a keepstar on grid with it, that literally has a Death Star beam. 
---
The reason the printed argument works is that the ansiblex was brought in to replace jump bridges and so should have feature parity. This is not the case atm.
---
But your entire corps meaning of life is just to reinforce the HED jumpbridge every day right? Jump bridge online.
---
Sorry for hearing this, we were so happy when we learned there would be an apology.  It seemed that the war would have the end and we could be good neighbors again at that moment.  :(
---
And also sorry for the deleted reply too, but screenshoted :)
---
The mug was a gift.
---
Hmpf! Let’s see how far it’ll get them!
---
I believe i speak for all of TEST when i say ,"sry bro".
---
There.  All fences mended.  Let the bluing commence.
---
The above apology counts for the whole alliance because i am in fact a very important person in TEST\* and not some random shitter on Reddit.
---
^(\*Source : "dude, trust me")
---
evictus, the intiative of the south
---
They could be protected by a keyed gate that disappears once the event is complete.
---
Aren't they all going to be using VPNs so they can connect in the first place?
---
I don't know your context, but in the map, if you click and hold on something, you should get the radial menu. From there you can dscan the anom/location/thing
---
Thanks for doing this, but Initiative Mercenaries is in the Imperium proper, much like The Initiative itself. It's the trial alliance for corporations looking to join The Initiative. I don't know why it's that way, but it is. IM and INIT go on the same fleets, use the same comms, etc. and essentially function as one alliance.
---
[deleted]
---
The only way to stop botting is to stop the ability to multibox. This would also force the player base to recruit like we use to.
---
Great post. I talk about this all the time. Triglavians spreading across new Eden in that huge titan, destroying one system at a time. Consuming all it's resources. Forcing players I to regions they don't belong. Null sec alliances quivering with fear, hiding behind the protection of low sec gate guns and then CONCORD.
---
A great wormhole opens, just like what happened in the solar system of old Eden. We travel through that wormhole to escape the triglavians. In the other side of that wormhole... is the 64bit client and a whole new galaxy.
---
需要翻譯麼？
---
 Who needs translation?
---
Nah we killed it, so we're trying new things like killing legacy supers on forts.
---
Horde is definitely not weak - they're a force to be reckoned with, they have both huge numbers and good FCs, and support from NC/PL. Also, that's not how stamps work.
---
Lol PIBC are going to shit up the game hard, inb4 response fleet dispatched to each player who insults the great CCP (not the bad one, the really bad one).
---
Kurwa
---
TAPI tithe tbh.
---
Don't drink your quafe til elo start calling targets. Takes a while for some people to get warmed up with aligns.
---
Panfam already blued the other Chinese army, so we had to get one of our own I guess?
---
They did, Ill agree. I lived in dronelands in 10/11 and saw it frequently. But it does make them more vulnerable and less profitable.
---
&gt;and not some random shitter on Reddit.
---
well
---
The logs show nothing!
---
When approached for comment on their imminent eviction, the current residents of Omist said "00110110101 0110101001 11010101010 01010100110!"
---
No, that would be a horrible idea: I run 10/10s and not only would that make selling and buying them impossible it would mean you are basically completely safe inside one.
---
Get your alt in Horde
---
To be fair even now you can get a warpable location on the first scan pass if you are good at dscan.
---
G O O D
---
when will you be eating hot wings or whateve cringy shit you do instead of apologizing now that it's clear you're trying to kill Eve online?
---
now TAPI is bluetral with the imperium and actually blue with PIBC. some how they've managed to make allies with both the largest group in all of serenity and tranquility at once. sometimes the cowardice is just down right impressive
---
"Anyone who proposes sharing power intends to hold all of it eventually."
---
Coming soon to an omist near you: that grey color is probably changing.
---
It was an idea. Personally I don’t think anyone is going to nerf his pvp ship to fit a probe launcher to scan you down. It’s debatable if you check d-scan often enough in a combat site to protect yourself from being scanned down anyway.
---
guess combat scan probes would pick up such signatures.
---
&gt; if you are good at dscan
---
ok, but currently it rewards people who are good in it, not everyone automatically.
---
Im also sorry :(
---
Would this work given they would have to be connected to a VPN?
---
name checks in
---
Haha is this from discord? I really should get on praise bob.
---
Can never have enough spreadsheets
---
Ehh. I’m stupid though I’d always be annoyed. The only thing that gets me is when you get this super cool ship your super excited to fly and then suddenly CODE NO SCOPES YARRRR HAULER REEEEEEEE
---
we're best friends, vily said so.
---
Why bother answering you? The only time you will even be on the CSM voting page is when you click the link on jabber.
---
You're never going to get an invite to PL unless you ungroup those guns for maximum killmail whoring.
---
Yeah but if a software has one behavior for a decade and you change that behavior, unintended or not, people are going to be pissed.
---
Taiwan Number 1?
---
Looks like F.I.R.E. is a big red penis sticking it to "valued allies friends and pets"
---
Because CCP hates autocannons.
---
They aren’t upgraded for super cap production I heard
---
I really don't want ansiblexes to be able to defend themselves for relatively free (~1b or less pos) unmanned. Not every random can push the keepstar dickswing button. Also keepstars are expensive. Yes we have a bunch of them. No they have not been as effective at stopping jb camps.
---
Fact is, they do not have feature parity. They act like gates, causing no fatigue, and are not self-defending like JBs. Someone, whether in ship or citadel gunning, has to defend them. 
---
I kinda wish they didn't allow them within citadel weapons range, to make it an absolute that you needed ships to defend them, but at that point we could anchor them on pos grids until they actually remove poses.
---
Player built stargates aren't jump bridges. If CCP wanted them to be the same as jump bridges they would have just given us upwell jump bridges.
---
Haiiii
---
I can do 200m+/h in any nullsec region with a 4m sp char.
---
I heard kick suad
---
Strategic cruisers fit combat probes with pretty minimal sacrifices and hunting people in DEDs is a long tradition. Sometimes you just use a T3, sometimes it's scanner + tackle + dps.
---
a) legacy is the name of sapporos car
---
b) the shade of blue used is the color of his car
---
Its memes all the way down
---
Speaking as someone who spends his life trying to make sense of spreadsheets created by idiots I would like to argue that yes you can.
---
Well i was hoping they would be independent and go north or east.
---
If they behave like a gate and CCP wants them used like gates then they should allow anyone to jump, you know, so aggressors can actually do anything when fighting near them.
---
Otherwise you are just mashing together two separate things, taking the best parts and none of the drawbacks. 
---
Like they did with citadels... look how well that's gone.
---
Iirc, CCP has done a few events where they played as drifters
---
Without wishing to sound too positive as we are on Reddit, and this is Eve,  I'd just like to say I think this would be a great idea.
---
I'll be honest there were people being absolutely disgusting racist shitters in TEST. I'm all for shitting on the bot spam, fuck FRAT, etc. Also fuck Chinese nationalists. But seriously guys, we don't have to be that racist. Chinese gamers on NA services are often very much in favour of the truth and against the nationalist agenda. They're not all assholes, they're not all botters, hackers, etc.
---
Maybe Mango will become the alliance of Chinese players that don't suck shitdicks and bot?
---
Or maybe they won't and we'll kick them.
---
Let's stop assuming they're going to be shitlers just because they're from China. A lot of PIBC people already came over and joined frat to bot. Give this group at least a chance, and stop being racist cunts.
---
Also calling frat pandas isn't racist their logo is a fucking panda.
---
Don't you know TEST Chinese best Chinese?
---
you tried
---
Do you want 2008 era l4 high sec mission alts (and bots) back?
---
Semi related. I always thought it'd be cool if PvP fights generated relic sites after the wrecks despawned, where you could go in and scan or salvage stuff that would be randomly generated from what was blown up.
---
Yes, tell that to the apoc miners in highsec.  Those alpha changes really showed them who is boss.
---
but most of the time its impossible to get from point A to point B without flying through at least one low sec system
---
Hahaha noob highsec carebears, why dont  they all come to sov null to expeience some **real** risk and play eve with all the big boys.
---
Horde/dreddit/karmafleet is recruitng!!! 
---
Check us out we have access to safe space!!
---
This is why I shitpost about the Chinese government, not folks of Chinese descent.
---
I thought Dunk's Fanfest talk on leading was the single most intelligent leader talk I have ever heard from a space warlord.  It dealt with actual connection and personal relations of which I seldom hereabout on a higher level.
---
Once in a while, I will loop that talk with the montage of This is Really EVE, and my face hurts from laughing so much.
---
You have my vote, Dunk.
---
Pibc: we are moving to a new server and leaving ild bad blood behind.
---
Also pibc: hol' up an opportunity to beat on old enemies
---
Daily reminder that unintended playstyles and use of mechanics are not inherently bad?
---
Hey man, there's plenty of chinese for everyone, don't get sulky just because you couldn't blue em all.
---
well that hit a nerve, still who is he and why should l or anyone vote for him ?
---
Unironically yes, let's
---
I assume they are shitlers because they side with test.
---
Give then the same horrific lock time, sporadic use of different modules and abysmal tracking. 
---
Yeah I'd be ok with them auto attacking.
---
mmhmm
---
Yea we wouldn't want to reward skill. That'd be outrageous.
---
Don't forget the peace agreement over Perimeter Keepstar. They are the most battle-hardened force in New Eden, they don't have to fight to prove it.
---
With a jump bridge on a POS, the POS would automatically shoot (if settings are correct). For a Keepstar, only like 3 ppl actually have access to fire the doomsday per alliance. The chances of them actually firing is almost nill I think. I could be totally wrong though.
---
CTA's piss me off so I guess I'll be passing
---
They like to treat every Chinese  descent as a Chinese government.
---
Most battle hardened super capital force in New Eden. I'm glad ccp brought us to this situation by giving everyone easily replaceable supers and structures for maximum safety.
---
Who cares? Only the Amarr&lt;-&gt;Jita pipeline matters.
---
Once upon a time... Sites didn't immediately identify as Data or Relic. They came up as Radar or Gravimetric or something. And the Relic based sites used to be ruins, or battlefields with lots of wrecks adrift. I'd love to see that brought back.
---
Wrecks last for 2 hours. So what I'd do is monitor the timer for the last wreck created on a grid. When that wreck is 1hr old, it spawns a beacon that can be scanned for. Say it's the black box trying to signal for rescue or something. And all the wrecks get marked Blue so anyone can tractor and loot without flags. 
---
Then salvage crews can scan for those beacons and go clean up. That way the victor, whether mission runner or combatant, has an hour to come get their loot. And then everyone else has an hour to come get it before it evaporates.
---
You're brave after all the brisc junk. But then again you're brave. Best of luck, youve got my vote.
---
Yeah it’s a bad faith argument on their part in a lot of cases. I’m sure there is plenty of actual racism but let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
---
Why were DSTs removed? I'm curious since it's my favorite.
---
WH space is da best
---
So the rumor were true in the end o.0
---
Now let's see how the TEST/WC wars go :)
---
maybe they aren't being racist, they're just saying that because it's provably true that 1) the vast majority of video game cheaters are Chinese and 2) this particular group of Chinese are particularly prolific by even that comparison, that these Chinese people are going to come to tq and cheat and ruin the game
---
maybe "Chinese" is a descriptor, not a racist slur, and you should stop assuming any word that you think has to do with a race is a racial judgment
---
we don't hate them and want them gone because they're Chinese. we hate them and want them gone because they're Chinese cheaters and we have seen what happened to serenity
---
No it wouldn’t work, it’s just what TAPI does because they’re a bunch of faggots who aren’t mature enough to understand the fact that trying to get real life people arrested over a video game is completely fucking retarded.
---
Good morning Snooters.
---
Is there really a good reason not to fight in hisec unless they're all going to destroy CODE together?
---
The amount of times I've been shot at by keeps strongly suggests that more than 3 dudes have gunnery.
---
Also POSs were sporadic in their fire at best, randomly used different mods and had horrific lock times. Plus you could defang a pos quite easily.
---
Imagine having 1k optimal
---
This meme was made by the caldari missile masterrace gang
---
This is terrible news , and deserves its own Reddit post !!!
---
Panfam + FRT + Skill is nowhere equal to the size of the blue donut TAPI has created you fucking idiot, and it’s only because whenever anything important happens or tapi is up against a wall you call the Imperium, creating the biggest most cancerous blob the game has ever seen.
---
Did he say anything about an exploration salvage t2 frig like the prospect?
---
They’re already starting to censor, that’s why they can’t react to pings anymore
---
Double or triple those numbers for 7RM standing in the glory days of PH in Pure Blind. Camp KLY indeed.
---
Thank you 🙏🏻
---
Not gonna lie this is pretty ingenious.
---
Best ISK an alpha will make in hisec is scamming, because it relies on enginuity and irl smarts, not character skills. Be creative. greedy and rich go hand in hand, and you gotta find the type of people that gets their greed to make em stupid. Couple classics are the protection racket (offer protection for ISK, don’t deliver), the bad Samaritan (offer help to bumped freighters and just kill them), the ISK doubler, and scam contracts.
---
Well, at least if everyone would warp off immediately a roamer would be able to crack open and loot the MTU, so you wouldn't feel like you totally wasted the roaming time.
---
Even the Chinese government isn't retarded enough to arrest its people for what they read and have no control over seeing online. If you lacked such stupidity we wouldn't be having this conversation...
---
You can see if the fort is [0] or not, which is a pretty good proxy for it.
---
As long as you still have them...
---
PIBC(AOM) will not participate in the  TEST/WC war
---
I'm fine with being able to take a jump gate while bubbled - it's not a warp. But HIC points should probably stop you escaping. The same argument applies to stargates, though.
---

---
&gt; I don’t think anyone is going to nerf his pvp ship to fit a probe launcher to scan you down
---
Okay you just officially showed that you don't know enough about this topic to meaningfully engage. Hunting in T3Cs is probably the standard, but if not that it's certainly commonplace.

Hello, I'm your friendly neighborhood yossarian.  I haven't logged on in two years, and I approve this message.

---
You don’t say? The intent of these mouth breathers is as I said, just because it doesn’t work (you know cus the Chinese use a fucking VPN, along with China not arresting everyone who searches about tianman square) doesn’t mean it isn’t still retarded.
---
Plus in China they can arrest you for whatever they like, there is no rule of law like we have in the west. So yeah if the government saw you accessing information about Tianman square or similar topics they could use that as grounds for an arrest, look at the Muslim “re-education camps”. It’s a dangerous game TAPI are (trying to) play and any reasonable person would understand that it’s a shitty and stupid thing to do.

A modified probe launched by a T2 salvage ship would be awesome, especially if that ship was geared towards ninja salvaging.

If your interested here is Dunk's [Not Running for CSM 13](https://youtu.be/-uBHAK1R2pA) video he did last year, and his [How To Lead Without Being CEO](https://youtu.be/_ODWfChfqr4) presentation from Eve Vegas this year. 
---
He is legitimately one of best people I've met playing Eve.
---
More like carrier, bomber, garmur, omen navy, orthrus. Flex on tidi fights lmao
---
I've run hundreds of escalations and exactly once I can think of have I been combat probed with my noticing.  In that case I was still able to escape because the enemy landed at range on a site with no accel gate.  Hunting escalation runners is extremely challenging, very few people are actually competent at it, and I'd hate to see that change even if it would make it easier to hunt runners day tripping into my space from highsec to run ded 5s.
---
Most of the time it isn't, especially when it's the system's main citadel.
---
Hello not everyone in TEST is like alcoholocaust
---
The main issue with this is that it changes the mechanics of locations that are currently impossible to scan down with regular probes, i.e. missions and (I think) DED escalations. If, for whatever reason, you decide to warp off a mission site for example, you cannot be sure that it's safe to warp back, since someone could have scanned down any wrecks left. It also makes life a bit easier for DED runners that regularly forget to bookmark the site, before leaving, in order to come back and loot it. :P
---
Not arguing that this would be necessarily a bad change, but tbh, if wrecks contributed significantly to server load, CCP might have already addressed the issue. I've never heard it mentioned as a cause of server load. So, especially in the case of CCP, if something isn't broken, it's better not to touch it at all. :P
---
If you are hunting escalation runners with anything other than max skilled covops with a full rack of scan mods and virtue pod + faction/abyssal disruptor Lachesis + DPS waiting to +1 system when tackle happens, you're doing it wrong.  
---
There is no other way to consistently catch runners if they are aware dscan exists.
---
Nah, "go home chink" and all that shit has been racist. People have been complete fucking cunts in our comms.
---
Putting a bubble 1j from staging while trying solo sometimes leads to good 1v1s. Like t1 cruiser, t3d, dramiel, etc. Make sure you zkill to see if people coming are blobbers or cyno retards. Apart from gemi, catch, provi. Tribute and sometimes the ring areas are good for 1v1s.
---
I'm at the office so I can't go bust out a bunch of fits right now. I mostly fly heavy tackle / antitackle for gangs myself, so I don't even have a toon trained into a Drekavac yet. I just hate fighting them in anything that isn't a blob of hecates. Blasters still fuckmelt anything they can't meltfuck.
---
Yeah, ya'll got a cut of the action simply by being the 500-pound gorilla that could take it all away from both other parties combined, **IF** you decided to get up off the couch and contest it.
---
I am clearly misrepresenting my stance here, and I apologize for that.  I absolutely agree that the toxicity of some players is ridiculous.   I can't seem to pull up the original statement, as I'm on mobile at work, but I didn't recall them saying they would continue to investigate.  Contrary to how my comments may be painting me, I actually like CCP and eve.  But no one is perfect and mistakes are made.
---
Most farmers do not have 200+ accounts, and you don't seem to know how many sp/injectors you get per month

---
Fuck it. He has my vote.
---
This war isn't over our dislike for you as being Chinese, so any apology for being racist certainly wouldn't end the war.
---
An apology, acknowledgement, and genuine action to stop botting might though.
---
I'm wondering how jealous Mittani is that Vily stopped sucking his dick to go suck off PIBC as a whole to try and get them on his side.  
---
It must be a lot of sucking up after the amount they insulted the chinese consistently....

Yea from the info seems they won't. 
---
However I do believe there will be some impact on the war because of this...
---
Here's a short post with the basics: http://dunkdinkle.com/announcement/
---
I will be posting more info and answering questions throughout the campaign.
---
they weren't already?
---
tapi is the one giving these people shelter
---
so... you're just mad in general? I guess? but not at anything in particular?
---
see that wasn't hard, but still no reason to vote for him unless he gets us drifter ships and drifter outfits ;P
---
NC.co
---
That may or may not be true however subcap fleets take longer to form and to bridge, which would have been okay but they nerfed the time you have to save said ship.  At the end of the day CCP had to hand out heavy nerfs and introduce a new faction with OP ships just so P.L. could get a few wins.
---
maybe they don't want hordes of Chinese botters ruining their game *as they have been proven to do*?
---
I know you have to virtue signal and stuff but you don't have to pretend to be so dumb you don't understand the issue
---
"most farmers"  no, the relevant farmers yes. if you have a couple of farms you are not contributing to pushing down the margins in any relevant way. 
---
There are under 10 people supplying 90% of injectors. 
---
I know exactly how many injectors I get pr month. Its all about what you train, your remaps and implants.
---
Lies! Krabs only live in null.
---
I’m talking about how tapi has been spewing this at FRT for ages, the original parent of these comments was being sarcastic and referencing that, at least that’s my understanding
---
regular T2 Ammo or even Phased Plasm did this already
---
It's been 3 hour and none of y'all are gonna mention the framed photo of Mittani on his nightstand? 
---
Great touch Dunk.
---
how?
---
because too small monitor to prinscreeing 9 sites :-P
---
And even with that, 10/10s are probably a pain in the neck, especially the ones where they can leave room 1 intact behind them and on top of that a T3C should get off grid before the lach finishes landing if they react the second it appears on grid.
---
VNI has much more DPS with heavy drones
---
why?
---
Id pay good money for wreck scanning probes
---
The PRC has an extensive legal system that's more complex than most Western countries, and no they won't just arrest people for talking about or accessing info on about Tiananmen Square. TEST is just dumb as fuck like most Muricans and actually believe the propaganda that gets spit out by mainstream Western media.
---
After all the studies showing all the nasty shit that grows inside coffee machines this is all I'll ever use.
---
highsec anomaly running isn't bad isk because you can blast thru them and then run the escalations you get but there is way too much competition in most of the highsec. except solitude, it is pretty quiet there and i made few bils casually doing anoms + escalations in a week when i went there as a vacation from nullsec.
---
Right but we I mean they can’t set their settings to Safer.
---
This is quality bait.
---
Shit I’ve been caught
---
 “Stay back, he’s got blue eyes!” 
---
 “I’ve always had blue eyes!”

---
Yeah I forgot about Money Badgers too.
---
Excuse me? I have no interest in botters or virtue signaling, but you don't have to be an absolute racist cunt either. I really don't know how the fuck you get this riled up over a narrative that doesn't even work.
---
TBH this picture makes me think of an ansiblex.

Sounds about right to me.
---
Even the UN says there’s credible reports of this happening, idk if what you say is correct. Ofc China won’t just arrest people for searching things about Tianman square, but if you were someone like a Uighur in China it could be used against you.
---
Do you have a discord?

Sure there is.

---
I don't know much about 10/10s.  I do most of my running and hunting in lowsec because the payout potential for 5 and 6/10s is so much better and they're so much easier.
---
That being said, you are correct that catching compete site runners is damned near impossible.  Lach with 80k point remains your best bet - it is simply a matter of whether they react immediately and warp to something near their align point.  If they panic or fumble for a second or two they're dead.
---
How much isk per hour are you krabs in your rorqs making in regular mining belts out in null?
---
what am i looking at
---
Apparently typing 'Taiwan is a country' in local is - per my fleetmates - a good way to get reported/spanked.
---
Sure. But the module either has absurdly low ehp and is mounted on the ihub, or can be hacked and disabled for an hour.
---
When this happens, no notification to those in the constellation is announced. Local just freezes. This allows covops ships to be used for actual covops, and can be utilized by small or roaming gangs or large fleets alike.
---
How about a second server instead?
---
4 something years ago I got kicked from TEST for shitposting about BRAVE here

^^^andshootingthemingameaswell
---
D-scan is a simple  wave form bouncing off a target an returning.  An it can only estimate ranges by the strength off the return wave.
---
It probably also uses a signature return pattern to determine what it picked up.
---
Probs scanning down an locking on to the same thing need a lot more to get a fix. Wrecks being a lot off smaller things would be a much smaller return with out any other signals to use as reference.
---
And this is working over AU's off space.
---
The real lie is calling them re-education camps when the people sent there don't come back.
---
 you don't mean that.  Imagine how bored you'd be.
---
If you to play for free do your self a massive favour. Go to null sec and moon mine for two or three months. You could do vni ratting but it does not pay as well and is solo play. It is a 100 hours on carno, you will mine repleat and loperrite, that with bring those  100 hours down. Get the plex.

Then do what ever the fuck you want, because keeping your account plexed is 5 times easier then getting it first plexed.

---
I'm not American and I don't have much of a stake in this but one can easily observe what you call a "liberal bias" is much milder than what goes on in places like fox. There are things which you would call bias but actually isnt. Gun regulation for example is pretty much figured out in the rest of the civilized world but a political debate only in US. So is the credibility of things like global warming, gender wage gap, universal healthcare and so on. A TV advocating for these might seem "liberally biased" to you but is actually scientifically pretty objective. Meanwhile places like fox need to disseminate hardcore koolaid to argue against them.
---
Imagine if slavery was still a thing and a debate and you would call anti-slavery networks "liberally biased". Well no, actually the debate in your country is rather behind of it's time, and one side is drinking the koolaid while other side is pretty objective. Same is happening with today's issues.

Radar, Ladar, Gravimetric, Magnetometric.  Each with their own types of probe, each with their own scan ranges, which couldn't be moved, or placed within range of another probe.  Oh, those were the days ...
---
There will be another war. It will happen. Lots of ships will die, many will claim already replaced. SRP funds will start to dry up, content will dry up, or people will just get blueballed. Goal posts will get moved, and finally victory will be claimed by both sides. Didn't want that space anyways, or something.
---
5s and 6s would definitely be easier: I have been probed in a 10/10 final room and just finished the site because there were 4 warps and like 200km of burning between me and anyone landing. I used to do a little LS site running and hunting and would use a snaked captor to catch people in 5s and 6s and would run 4s (and sometimes solo hunt in them) in a phantasm. The Lach is definitely better though, I usually had the advantage of already having the site probed when they entered.

Well its just my opinion and don't get it wrong as if Im trying to say the things test does is right but what if they played fair in general? The frat is largely known for mass scale of RMT and botting, and afaik they actually do not give any single fucks to thr rules if they can have some extent of advantage. Not to be mentioned that they cheat alot in other games. I know test has racist dicks who will spam those nonetheless, but wouldn't it be one of the reasons for test to be mad at frat?

These numbers will be off but it looked roughly like this:
---
1) Buy MCT for 1.2b
---
2) Use MCT, train pointless shit with perfect remap and implants
---
3) wait a month
---
4) Buy extractors, use in face
---
5) Sell injectors. Make cost of MCT + Extractors + like 300 mil profit or whatever
---
So farming SP, not trading, though trading is obviously involved
---
Can someone explain to me why we have gotg defending that Fortizar, when it is used by snuff to drop them?
---
Shut up, Rhonin.
---
All that aside, GotG was defending the fort used to farm them.
---
Are a lot of players joining Paann faamm?
---
I know how to do it. But if profits are "super tight and often in the red" and the way to profit from them is to buy MCT's when they are on sale to stock up.. That's speculation and thereby trading?

I see two monitors and a bunch of dots
---
Pssst you can't tell them they are wrong.
---
to be fair to them, they also genuinely believe they're neutral to Goons.
---
Because Sort will suck that dick today in the hope he wont get pogoed by it tomorrow.
---
Well, it’s more like that now I’d agree. Way back when I was doing it, when galaxy pack sales were a weekly occurrence, it was just free money no thought needed

PIBC leaves Serenity, joins Serenity.

To be fair that's because King reacted with KRAB TIME one too many times.
---
Citadels are absolutely awful ways to pussy out of fights yes, so were pos shields. If we're talking about removing all sov controlled mobility maybe we should just remove sov.

At its heart China is still an authoritarian one-party state.  There is no legal recourse if you get on the wrong side of the party.

Dreddit wishes they were as gay as SUAD is.

This reminds me of goonposting.... "it was impossible for us to fight them, they had a cynojammer"

That information would be on local broad cast.

i was kinda sad when elistist ops left back in the day. a bunch of cool dudes in sigma squad left :(
---
They also said they'd not be pets, but here we are, they also said they're here to avoid the stagnation that is Serenity, but here we are. So yea, up to this point, there appears to be gap between what they say and what they actually do.
---
maybe get lanced idk
---
You're FWB with Snuff, why not me?
---
panfam had 700 and tri had 200 so you shit the bed over 100 peeps when 200+ imperium were in frigs?
---
There was a mention that wartime tax rates will be gone.  They are referring to the market fees in perimeter then we might see rates at 0.3% or higher and the much higher taxes would easily fund splitting it
---
Are you talking about WWB?
---
Incoming Noctis buffs!

I mean, the PRC invited EU and UN investigators to come and check it out, verify things... they declined. Doesn't really speak well for the allegations.

What "satellite info"? I don't want to turn this into r/worldnews but blurry satellite pictures of buildings don't prove anything, unless we want to believe Iraq had MWDs too. The PRC actually invited the EU and UN to investigate and they declined.

 🦀  🦀  🦀 CCP IS POWERLESS AGAINST A NULLSEC COALITION  🦀  🦀  🦀

And snuff and panfam are comparable?
---
This is Ozarks or Appalachia level of remote Backwoods Area, but not quite Northern Territory
---
The apparent reason: The Mittani logging in once in a blue moon has no say in Goonswwarm. other (competent) dudes are moving things ahead (luckily for goons).
---
Come hunt bots in wicked creek, DREDDIT IS RECRUITING
---
They also genuinely think they're fighting a war over "botting" (that their alliance leaders admit they don't actually care about) and that the rest of EVE is against them.
---
You know, I completely understand why the multi account culture exists, especially in a game like Eve. However, I completely agree with you that I think the game would be better without it. Unfortunately, CCP will never want this to change, as having one person pay for multiple accounts is like a dream come true.
---
DREDDIT IS RECRUITING
---
Ehhh
---
&gt; I’ve flown in every type of combat from high sec war decs to faction warfare to large sub-capital fleet action to capitals (old and new) to super-capital Ti-Di fests to wormhole secret sex parties. 
---
What toon are you doing all this pvp on because it's clearly not Dunk Dinkle. 
---
Given the following stats:
---
W-space: 
---
You lost a total of 2 ships and kill 4 in w-space on Dunk Dinkle ( 1 loss and 1 kill being last year ). 
---
High-sec: 
---
Last one was in 2013 ( to be fair you lost a travel Raptor in 2015 ) 
---
Low-sec: 
---
Last one was in 2015 ( to be fair you lost a cyno Ares there last year ).
---
Us and Western Europe the primary method of cheating is probably input broadcasting
---
I found drone ships to be quicker in clearing sites. Light and medium drones travel faster than most ships, so will apply DPS more quickly than if you chased enemies yourself with auto-cannons. 
---
Since you are trained for Minmatar, maybe try the Sunesis? It's a very flexible, noob-friendly destroyer-level drone ship. It gets a scanning bonus so you can find sites quicker. If you can train for Gallente, I'd go with the Algos and then Vexor / Vexor Navy Issue.
---
I'll gladly take another blue Ally if it means the botters in Omist get the boot.
---
PIBC still have to be seen how they will act on tranquility
---
Ferox, Ferox, Ferox, Megathron, Ferox.

This would require vaunted Legacy FCs like Shattered Brainstem and CaseyLFEED to not get mulched the second they jump gate.

I have no issue getting around the towns that matter.

It's GSM election time. Sort needs the votes.

NC had to burn back to their cap fleet in Malpais to keep defending their renters. Couldnt take a fight where they didnt outnumber the other side in caps or 3:1 odds lel

Mostly because of people like you that refer to other players as "noob care-bears" while simultaneously referring to yourself as a manly big-boy...

Sign me up for hanging out with people not like that thanks.

what? your coalition is smaller? sucks to be you then
---
It does suck that this will mean less people will be playing the game, but you are right, it really is just people now having to pay the "proper" price for a product like everyone else. However, it does suck more for the people in certain countries that have extremely low average income compared to other countries, but what can you do? I guess you could move to a country with a larger economy, or get a remote job in a better average income country.

Imma be real you picked everyone’s least favorite pve race. The only people that I know that pve in mini ships fly a Mach or vargur, both of which aren’t really and option for an alpha. I know some guys that like the scythe fleet but I would recommend cross training into gallente or Caldari. Caldari will give you missile skills that you will need on some mini ships. Gallente will be generally easy mode pve with the vexor navy.

Explanation:

The British PM, Theresa May, has just publicly fired the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, claiming that he leaked confidential information from a top secret meeting.

Gavin Williamson for his part has 100% denied any involvement and claims it's others that have stitched him up.

The story for all 3rd party visitors:

Anti-blobbing Tri batphones all of panfam (700 subs + 200 caps) for shield and armor timer vs only Snuff.  Crys on reddit when Snuff brings their own backup for final timer.
---
Is this true? Can we get the Mittani to confirm this?
---
It’s not true if the Mittani himself doesn’t confirm it.
---
He would have more problems finding edible food at that point than having to pay more for space games.
---
Ummm replicators???
---
Who do you think would pitch? Mittani looks kinda like a catcher to me!
---
Test are diet goons.
---
to give a lore reason as to why not, scanning is looking for signals being given off by a desired target, such as operational ships, relic and data site beacons, etc. wrecks have no power and no signal generation, so the scan probes cannot lock on to them.
---
forget null, rorqs FW anything like that we just want drifter ships and drifter cloths

China does have an extensive legal system, but unlike the standard western conception / design this system is not independent of the government. Judges need to pay careful attention to directives and intentions from the Communist Party or risk jail or disappearance. There is a very real risk of impact on their lives from the decisions they execute, and as such they target corruption explicitly such as in Xi's highly public but targeted campaign when needed, but often let it pass in other cases. You can also find hundreds of cases of individuals being arrested for vague crimes of "disturbance" or "disruption" which are exclusively reserved for individuals rioting or being violent in public in the West, but in China can extend to writing op-eds, posting online, or other crimes against the Communist Party.
---
There is a vast reservoir of documentation of the Chinese government's use of facilities where they force Uighurs to renounce either religion or particular customs and attempt a crude forced brainwashing of respect and deference to the Communist party and the government writ large. If you choose not to believe that, then we can't have a discussion as we refuse to agree on what are basic facts. The extent of the camps could be up to debate, but their existence is proved. That is not negotiable.
---
Of course, the Chinese Government != the Chinese people, let alone individuals in a video game. A criticism of the first does not equal a criticism of the second, let alone the third.

Can't decide if replacing a group that's 95% bots with one that is like 50% bots qualifies as an improvement or not
---
Do you have plans to eventually turn test into a content chasing PVP alliance again or do you intend to continue to expand one of the largest blue lists in the game? What will you do when the only thing to shoot within 50 jumps is simple farmers? Do you believe this level of risk adversion is sustainable?

It can't be both?

Dran you'd take any ally regardless of pulse if it means another blue. Stop pretending your renters aren't botting up a storm while you turn a blind eye.
---
You want to put people in serious risk of real life reprehension just because they (according to your opinion) condones cheating?
---
It's like calling a SWAT team to someone's home for a fake hostage crisis. It's a joke, until it isn't.

What you really said: Imperium formed equal numbers to us and we didn't take the fight.

Most Americans wouldn't know that nor will they care.

Does a properly implanted and attribute mapped character really produce that much SP in a month to pay for 500 Plex alone?

You remember that time I deployed to TEST and destroyed the high sec market that had stood for 2 years with no competition, and then fought over it for 6 months.  Or do you remember that time I deployed to Geminate low sec and fought horde for 3 months and forced all of panfam to deploy against us to finally end it?  Or do you remember the time we declared war against winter coalition?  That was all within the last 6 months.  But yeah you right, we're the ones not creating content, it's everyone else.
---
So the strategy is to replace your current botters with a new set of professional botters?
---
And the party continues.
---
I believe people had been arrested just for using VPNs. If they want to arrest you, and they can find those stuff spammed by TEST on your computer, that will give them extra justifications against you.
---
It's a joke until it isn't.

Someone needs to cull the herd

There are a significant number of public options, and most people won't bother with a raitaru that is powered unless they have something against you in particular. Drop it a decent distance from Jita and away from any direct rout between trade hums and most people won't even notice it.

Botting was how Serenity operated.  Will see if they do so on tranquility where botting is a bannable offense.
---
It's a terrible Proxy for any large group, which if they have jump gates they probably are, because only a select group will have gunnery rights.
---
So goons are going to war soon then?
---
I love how GotG formed to help save the fort. The fort that goons use to attack gotg from. 195 IQ gotg
---
Horde will take you in no questions asked.
---
While you may be correct about skill injectors, they are definitely not going to remove them at this point, as they have gotten the company quite a large amount of money since they have become a thing.
---
I’m trying but you just sometimes make it too hard for me
---
Alas, someone i like on CSM

Lol!

How about the drifters and trigs invade simultaneously, go to war with each other and we get caught in the middle? Eve: Collateral Damage.
---
Nooooooooooo? Doing it is krabing and gateing is not elite?
---
when 300 more = equal lol. 
---
Also you had caps on field, the incursion stopped PANFAM from being able to get caps of their own.   
---
Don't act like this would have been a fair fight
---
As someone else mentioned, join a player group. There are a variety of friendly newbie corps in the game: Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, and Karmafleet to name a few of the super big ones. 
---
Also use the rookie help chat channel.
---
Man... Let me know the next time snuff gates titans through a incursion with a 1000 man form up on the other side... HAHAHA!

Welcome to EVE! There's a lot of fun stuff to do. A lot of corps, like [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/), have newbro-friendly programs that help newer players get situated into the game. 
---
One thing to note though: Dreddit, and namely our alliance, TEST, is located in nullsec space, which is the most lucrative space an alliance can claim in New Eden. It's very dangerous here and we PVP all the time, but we do have areas where it's relatively safer to do PVE activities to make money.
---
Ours specifically pairs you with a mentor who will guide you through any troubles you have. We also have a crap ton of free stuff we hand out to newbros like implants (accelerate your training time), free ships, and free skillbooks. 
---
There's a lot more to talk about, so feel free to send me a message on Reddit if you're interested in our corp.
---
No that didn't because independent journalist can't even visit Tibet. 
---
Now secret prison camps well most of the Uyghurs in china claim to be missing family members. 
---
The EU as asked multiple times along with the UN and was denied everytime by china ( to the point where china is using it's proxy state read Greece to block any more investigations into the issue within the EU ).

Now Greece owes a bit of debt to china so there more then willing to play ball here and cover the Chinese human right violations, but you likely already made you dollar with those 2 comments.
---
Wrecks should be scannable, in the interest of creating content.

Got it. Incursion &gt; North. Good to know.
---
Don't  get discouraged, eve is a complex game in many ways.  It takes time to master any aspect :)  Finding a group of players that will help you through the beginning and continue to foster your growth beyond that will make it a lot easier and more fun.
---
I mean, relatively speaking I guess?
---
The widow can already tank pretty will if you go with a tank fit vs. jams. 4% per level would be a bit much, no?
---
Here is my talk from EVE Vegas last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ODWfChfqr4
---
Huge if accurate
---
say it with Shrapnel bombs
---
lol ok. You're actually retarded if you don't understand why any alliance in eve wouldn't gate their supers into a incursion pocket when the enemy heavily outnumbers your subcaps.
---
No, it would not. 
---
People are just dumb.
---
Horseshit, bro. If your friend lives there, he's got to have the logistic side figured out and apparently he's also got the isk making sorted. With the injected skill points you could have lived pretty much anywhere with your friend(s).
---
You're just making up fairy tales and you ain't even  good at it.
---
You know, I feel dumb for not doing this, I guess I forget what long-term investing means sometimes.
---
Thanks!
---
lol rofl ok lol ok - rofl lol lol. What I get is that you can spin it or whatever you want, you didn't show up for the fight. The end. QQ about it all you want. Bitches walked away.
---
Perhaps because Snuff just want to kill some rorqs and the occasional titan or two -  which is fine, cost of doing business, yadda, yadda
---
But NC. would like to rent out that prime botspace.
---
I spent 4 days in Providence after my first year which was in highsec.  I was not impressed.
---
Because it used to have an ecm tank and that was its roll before you could targer ships ecming you?
---
Rarely did i read a such wonderful description of test.
---
Wasn't there like a separate sub for Jobs?
---
Karmafleet is recruiting!
---
Yes, dunk for CSM.  Dunk have my baby!
---
Glad you took the plunge!  I'd recommend you pick a new player alliance and join up!  
---
I'd recommend Pandemic Horde (which I'm in).  Just hit apply to corp in game and you're account will be accepted.  Once in, feel free to ask any questions.  
---
Horde only has two rules: 
---
1. Don't be a dick 
---
2. Don't give bad/misleading information
---
I'd highly recommend Eve University. They do one of the best jobs of helping people learn as much as they want to. They also expect people to eventually move on so it is a great way to start with no long term commitment.
---
Right but if you take the ECM off of it now and put shields, it tanks just as well as the other blops. It's not that it "used to have ECM tank and now has no tank." It tanks roughly the same as the other blops if you drop the ECM for a shield tank and make it a DPS widow.
---
I like that one better

@CSM creation, 2008, CCP after T2.0: We are creating this group of player representatives partly to serve an important watchdog function of making sure that EVE developers never again abuse their positions and the trust of our community.
---
@CSM 7, 2011, CCP after *Fearless*: Our recent mistakes just reinforce the importance of the CSM in providing oversight, feedback, and advice on the standards our player base expects us to achieve and that we will never again abuse our community's trust.
---
@CSM 14, 2019, CCP: We are going to ensure that all CSM members not only sign an NDA and take part in extensive onboarding but conform to a CSM Code of Conduct so that they can never again abuse our trust.

Eve is in such a shit state pvP and war wise, that I would not be surprised that the last desperate step would be this kind of PvE, that sounds exciting for carebears and single player fans

He's got to do another million dollar fight interview first.
---
I would love to see how many assets are in that reserve at this point, and which accounts that have been banned had the most assets.
---
Propably the same way as the people who currently bot on TQ already, durr
---
I told the CSM this in their little discord channel before the gates were released. I got shut down and laughed at...

This statement can be applied to literally any instance of Eve politics in the last 6 years or so.

i think he wants to make the "role" of the widow a tankier blops than the other blops me thinks
---
So you're telling us the incursion didn't matter because Snuff would have won anyway? :thinking:
---
Goons say Jump and GotG ask how high, it's pathetic really. Imagine being in that coalition in 2019 bottomfeeders at best living off the underbelly of the goon whale. Not only did they relinquish 40 faction fortizars they also relinquished any kind of pride they ever had.
---
Daily reminder: CCP never intended for wormholers to be so salty.
---
Cheers man :)
---
You did not just describe a big problem in peoples mentality while playing Eve, but also a mentality people have in real life that leads to burn-out and dissatisfaction. If your goal is only to get "more", you will never reach that goal, not even close to it.
---
Thanks pal its appreciated :)
---
Must have been a few dreads inside?
---
So just delete the other three then lol
---
The other blops don't get ewar bonuses, why should the widow get to be a special snowflake
---
Going to look up that streamer, if you ever did them, are Burner missions actually fun? It seems cool to have to fit a specific fit to beat a specific enemy, but i'm not sure if it is still a challenge after that fitting and countering process.
---
as soon as you explain why people still hang around in the same alliance as sort
---
Am I blind? I don't see how a person is supposed to get up that, unless they are supposed to climb it or something.

yeah but then you can't monetize it and charge 4x what other space games do for cosmetic-only DLCs

Good point.  I'm not claiming to be a PvP expert.  My last 6 years have mainly been in null sec, but I did participate in high &amp; low in my early years.  As far as wormholes, they are scary and I only go into when specifically needed, usually as a scanner or for travel purposes.
---
Well wasn't it a snuff fort? Has nothing to do with gotg other than it being there to drop them. Better for them to get rid of it, oh noes.
---
&gt; maybe they don't want hordes of Chinese botters ruining their game as they have been proven to do?
---
great way to validate using racial slurs lmao. 
---
you're a real jackass you know that?
---
But that type of play can only preserve your current asset value, right? Because you’d essentially be switching into a more stable item but the trade would be even. Best case scenario, you could get the better end of a contract, but then you might as well just use isk rather than using the more complex item-to-item contract which is more likely to get rejected anyways because other people could see the same expected price dip that you see.
---
Isn't this a new jump gate for nullbears?
---
No, thats just test, goons and/or horde in a system.....actually yes you're right.
---
Is there ever a case where one item becoming cheaper will make another more expensive via supply chain? Seems to me like if the raw materials’ prices drop, then the derived product will necessarily become cheaper as well.
---

"With the switch to a 64-bit client we have decided to drop support for the 32-bit client, given that only around 0.5% of our pilots are currently playing on 32bit operating systems and the cost to support both architectures isn’t where we want to invest our development time."

Short AAR: Final Snuffed Out Astrahus timer in KI-TL0. Triumvirate formed a 60 pilot Loki fleet to bash the structure. To defend it, Snuffed Out formed a 30 pilot Legion fleet and bridged in on the structure. The Triumvirate fleet undocked from the Fortizar on the grid and warped to the citadel to fight Snuffed Out. 
---
The two sides clashed on the structure at close range. Triumvirate started poking at the Legions' logistics wing. The Legion fleet in return attempted to break the Lokis, with no result. While Triumvirate was unsuccessful at the start, after a few attempts it managed to volley a Guardain. From there, the Snuffed Out logistics wing collapsed as the Loki fleet pretty much decimated it. Snuffed Out reacted by jumping in a couple of Apostles and a HAW dreadnought.
---
From there on, the Loki fleet was able to break the Legions, destroying several in the process and tanking the incoming damage, even as Snuffed Out kept bringing more HAW dreadnoughts, increasing their overall number to 3. Getting nowhere and losing mainline ships, Snuffed Out decided to escalate further, bringing in combat carriers. Nearly 20 more combat carriers jumped in and added their fighters to the mix. Even with the fighters firepower, Triumvirate was barely managing to tank but finally started to break as well. Several Lokis started going down and the Triumvirate fleet tried to break away in order to warp off.
---
Most of the Triumvirate fleet managed to escape but a portion got caught by Snuffed Out interdictors and was destroyed. With the Loki fleet docking up, the citadel repaired, allowing Snuffed Out to claim victory at a cost.

It was at least better than the situation we have now as drone goo wasn't bringing any isk into the game it was taking it out.  Every industry job people ran using the minerals from the goo cost an ISK fee and when they sold it to someone it wasn't generating ISK just shuffling it around.

But now with bounties just flowing trillions into the economy no wonder PLEX are up to 2 bil for 500 now.

Hi. As linked by /r/paralyticpoison, the EVEUniversity page is a go to resource for most EVE Players.
---
As for the lore, I humbly recommend my own primer on the subject, I link out to many other sources. https://crossingzebras.com/the-eve-lore-primer/
---
For current events I also humbly recommend the network I am on, [Talking in Stations](https://www.talkinginstations.com/). They have a podcast every Thursday and Sunday. 
---
If my advice doesn't suit you, you can find most of the EVE content aggrigated on [TotalEVE.com](https://totaleve.com/)
---
As far as advice, fitting, etc. there are so many that I fear I may overwhelm you. If you want specfic advice you can ask it here, send me an in game mail, or even join my highsec newbie friendly corp: MALRO industries.
---
I didn't consider that it would turn off that isk faucet.
---
If all the rats dropped goo that might even reduce the amount folks make from rorqual mining.
---
Looks like the drama is reaching its peak again after WWB. Can't wait to re-enlist.
---
Talk to your corpmates and/or leadership. Every corp handles this differently. If you live in a wormhole, your corpmates will probably be very happy if you move your assets out of the home system before you win EVE, since anything you leave behind makes their assets more of a target by association. (Alternatively, you could just give stuff to your corpmates.)

Did you do lost-PLA in plaster or sand?

Between 40-80mil an hour depending on the ore you are mining, and on the local market. You can get more mining moons as well.
---
Blitzing level 3s can be just as good as level 4s. Beyond that, there is exploration (though you go through wormholes to null), or possibly the Abyss.

That time you declared war against winter with half the active non hisec player base behind you in case you fuck up? Fucking bold pgl bravo. I do remember when we deployed against geminate and accomplished more or less nothing but feeding dreads, I can't complain about that deployment much though as it was definitely dank content creation albeit it had absolutely no real consequence for anyone involved. A hisec campaign is fucking valiant, I'll commend you for enduring that autism. It's all artificial though. There is no more forging a new path. There is no more delve deployment and no more invasions to thrive. Nothing that happens is of any consequence now because anything you do will not be punished if done poorly beyond an inconsequential isk loss. I know this is what we were working towards but now it all feels hollow. I flew with test for years and I'd take cancer of Wicked Creek and Vale every time over these hollow content deployments done because everyone is bored from ratting in eso for months on end with zero fear. Do something bold like the old days. Cut ties with goons and start a real war. Invade Branch. Do SOMETHING that feels like it's of real consequence for anyone but the alliance coffers. At this point I'd even accept the horrifying faction warfare memes again. I guess at this point it might not be possible anymore between sov and diplos but I really do miss the cancer days when our narrative was fighting to survive and not trying to farm titans n+1 titans for battles we know won't ever happen at this rate and randomly deploying so people don't start bosoning each other. Maybe it just feels like test solid it's soul for stability.

Have you ever heard of teather? You can undock from a citadel in perfect safety. If someone outside Jita 4-4 doesn't like you, you're dead.
---
Yes, but even better is to use targeting range scripts on them since they have no falloff on the weapon and cannot shoot outside their optimal range.
---
Dude don't take your bitter out on me.  Your ideas for content are not good it sounds like you're just spit-balling to prove your point and doing it poorly.  You were in TEST for 1 month for the past year, don't pretend like you've been with us through anything the past year.
---
Look it's fine if you don't want large fight content anymore in the current meta, the current EVE meta isn't that great I'll give you that, but don't run off to some lowsec alliance and then blame me for the game CCP created.

The audio quality for this one was quite bad, but I really enjoy the tournament so far.

They had 900 we had 1000, 1000 - 900 = 100 difference. 200+ was in frigs. simple math... panfam brains wtf? no wonder you stood down can't count

then why would it work in wormholes?

Haven't played over 10 years. What has changed?

didn't stop us why would it stop them? big think....

Sure everyone had fun, thanks for the AAR too, I enjoy reading these when I can't play eve (-:

I guess that would make this a .... headliner

did you actually count your own numbers?

thank god you zoomed in on your local commentary in the video
---
trashtalking someone for not catching your lowsec cloak mwd hauler is pretty epic

Love the title. The unfamiliar would think this is a 3-way.
---
Yeah very true I'm always for more avenues to bring raw minerals into the game over raw ISK.
---
Life is one long lesson.
---
The people sent there get to start a new one.
---
I've actually not received even an attempt of attack for the full month I've been playing. So long as you're alert and aware, and seek out information on how the game works, highsec is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.
---
That's what I've been doing but it'd have been nice to have a pocket stick to throw out where there aren't any.
---
OK, then. Let's say that there are lots of Chinese cheaters. That means that legit Chinese gamers wouldn't want to play with cheaters, given that it's a much more pronounced problem over there?
---
The ironic thing is that you are calling people who hate cheaters more than you cheaters themselves.
---
Yeah this too 
---
&gt;Then again, if you do it right it would be :)
---
Pretty rude if you ask me, especially since you're completely wrong. I looked up the EVE uni video - it's from 2011? Are you for real? I have bad news for you, there are people joining EVE now that were *literally children when that was posted.* 
---
Maybe next time if you keep your mouth shut your foot will not slip in so easily.
---
No Imperium forces on the field? Was penifSMASH not in danger?
---
Date wise yes, because I don't log in -- but a quick reddit search left me unable to find any info on the first video linked.
---
No it's for what they were doing. Vpns are very easy to see. China controls its ISPs they likely do packet inspections they may not be able to see what's on the VPN data but they sure as hell will be able to see it's an encrypted packet.
---
"World ARK"... While I think you may be a bit grandiose on the notion of hated alliances banding together for PvE content is a bit far, in general, the idea of the massive universe changing invasion in which players choose a side _seems_ to be the direction they are going.
---
Stop reading local. Turn off logging. Problem solved.
---
I’ve been coming back to watch this over and over again.  I don’t know what it’s about either but man it makes me laugh
---
no way im gonna let goons out autism me
---
Yes, you can easily and safely run 10 rorques as long as your computer can handle it. Properly flown under a super umbrella they are very safe and only require player input every 30 min or so if no one bothers you.
---
Not even close.... Try harder!
---
No, both of these were reported in earlier this week.
---
yeah but they're not player run stargates in lots of other ways. they can be destroyed, you can anchor citadels in range of them, they are standings-controlled. for example, a dic bubble doesn't stop you taking a regular gate, but the guy bubbling you can also follow you through said gate. not the case with the AJG. 
---
OP's point is that they are the best of both worlds, and that's dumb.
---
No escape from reality

---
&gt; I really do miss the cancer days when our narrative was fighting to survive
---
Well, there's good news on that front at least.
---
I agree. That's why I think they shouldn't exist. My point wasn't that ansiblexes should or we're intended to have all the same functionality as a stargate. My point was that they we're intended to have more functionality than jbs.
---
Or bumping freighters in Uedama or Niarja
---
You should start by explaining what the problem is you're trying to solve.  Only then try to work out a solution.  btw, the fact you cannot get easy ganks against well organised player groups is not a problem for the game.
---
Over the past 10 years? A lot. To list some of the big ones:
---
1. [Citadels](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Upwell_structures) are the new POSs and outposts. There is to much to cover on the topic, so just go read the EVE-uni page in it.
---
2. [Skill injectors](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skill_Injector) now exist. Essentially a player can buy an item from the new eden store (NES) and extract SP 500,000 at a time, to then sell on the market. This has driven a massive increase in alts, particularly for the purposes of mining in rorqus, cloaky camping, and farming SP. Also, everyone and their brother can now fly a capital. 
---
3. EVE is now free to play. You can now play indefinably as an [alpha](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Alpha_Clones#Alpha_clones) without paying, but you can only train up to 5 mil SP, and you are locked out of many skills. An alpha can take advantage of about 20 mil worth of skills.
---
4. PLEX is now the new micro transaction currency, and one PLEX has been split so now you need 500 PLEX for one month game time instead of 1.
---
5. Lots of ship re-balancing has happened, and a bunch of new ships have been introduced as well. The newest ships are the [Triglavian ships](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Triglavian_Collective). There are also now faction capitols for a couple pf the pirate factions.
---
6. The new player experience has been complacently revamped.
---
7. There are no longer special edition ships for the most part, they have instead been replaced with ship skins that give unique paint jobs for ships, but aren't lost with the ship.
---
There is a lot more, but that should at least cover the headlines.
---

---
As you could tell yourself from the date, yes, those mails are only relatively new
---
We're working to fix the issues there, next match is much better in terms of audio quality, thank you for the feedback and we hope to keep up the good content!
---
Why you even care about local when there are hundreds if not thousands of people in that system?
---
It's like you are trying to make an argument in a Twitch channel with 10k+ viewers
---
The real story is that goons have become a pacifist alliance and hate any kind of content that isn't rorq mining so when they saw the potential for a fight they formed a "content denial fleet" to make sure no fight happened and we could all go back to mutiboxing invincible mining boats under the cap umbrella. 
---
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST
---
And the blue donut gets bigger. So much for shaking things up.
---
r/wow is leaking
---
No problem as such, the current system isn't broke. This change would just add an extra layer of immersion and add opportunities for expanded/module ship roles.
---
It would change roaming PVP by adding both risk and reward. For Sov based pvp it would add an additional objective to control and fight over.
---
I know the old saying 'If its not broke, why try and fix it'. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try and improve.
---

After reading down all the comments, especially the hopeful 'maybe its s mothership' one, coming upon this comment i just burst out laughing - all this buildup, and its really just a freighter.

I mean it seems they're just happy local is working.

What do you want local to look like when you have 100s of people sat in a chat not doing anything waiting for fighting or blue balls to start? If you were expecting an intellectual chat about a serious subject then you clearly are new to the internet.

This is the first good “T2 salvage ship” idea I’ve seen. IMO make this a feature suggestion somehow.
---
I seem to remember you ending up in our wormhole one night 😁.  That counts.
---
It's not even my original idea. T2 salvage ships have been suggested in various forms since they released the noctis, and especially since the Prospect was released the suggestions have tended towards T2 cloaky salvage ships.
---
This is amazing!  I've been trying to get into using the ESI for awhile but never made the jump. Any good tools or resources you recommend?

gf. couldnt press f1 fast enough to whore on you sal. i am too old :(
---
Dscan is a 1-0 either its in dscan at current range or it's not. It can't estimate ranges at all. That has to be determined manually.
---
The "waveform" thing is closer to how probe scanners work. Each probe propagates a wave, determines distance to a signal, and locations are found via triangulation.
---
I've done that with locusts... go slow they hit the windscreen, go faster they clog the radiator, go really fast they smash the sump and drive train...
---
Doesn't matter really cause your car will smell like baked locust for weeks...
---
So no low sec experience in the age of citadels no high sec experience with the new war dec mechanics and less wormhole experience than your average wing spawn pilot, so what exactly do you bring to the CSM? 
---
Like it's not like the CSM is massively lacking for people with an understanding of null sec mechanics and if even half the csm makes it back in that statement that still applies.
---
Don't get me wrong you likely make it on brand value, so this is clearly all theoretical I'm just not sold on what makes you well different from anybody else that lives in null that's running.
---
how is it blobbing with even numbers?
---
The highsec market war was the most interesting thing to happen in New Eden since I started playing EVE. Because it was actually a fight about something other than an old grudge or "because"
---
I don’t feel any kind of fear towards evil space lords who send out cards with spelling mistakes.
---
Did you?
---
Are you enjoing playing retarded? You had a massive sub cap superiority., by about 300 toons. No alliance in eve would gate supers through a jammed constellation with hostile sub cap superiority.
---
You also had the advantage of already being closer and having a fort to tether at in system. How is this hard to understand
---
Wow, I didn't realise that they were there to show their support for PenifSmash during the unwarranted and totally unecessary Penifgate investigation.     
---
 I thought it was just the monthly Imperium 'Pet Convention'.
---
It might be news to reeeetards, but test actually has Chinese corps in it, just like virtually any other major alliance
---
i'm still not convinced it's not just nutting extremely hard tbh
---
The fact that you dont undrstand this just tells you're another worthless f1 ousher with no real understanding of how eve really works. 
---
Have fun thinking you actually matter, when the fact is you're nothing without the people telling you what to do

I don't feel fear those who do not know the difference between spelling mistake and typos.

I spotted it too late. Since ReEddit is full of people who do not know the difference between you're, your, you are and cyons and cyno's, I was hoping this will go unnoticed. :(

---
I've been trying corp life again but sov null is just a pain for me. CTA and fleet participation requirements chafe me a bit because I feel that my contribution to the fleet is just an amount of DPS and EHP.
---
So far, I'm much happier in a small gang or solo environment with more autonomy in a fight, but I'm sticking it out right now; maybe there's something I'm missing.

what I mean by play properly, and I expressed it incorrectly is that a lot of wormholers talk about how great they are and how risky j space is, when in reality its only a handful of corps that do any meaningful pvp, a lot of people just farm sites and shit talk on reddit.
---
Take responsibility for your own life and stop projecting on people who can manage their time like an adult.
---
probably the most active pvp corps thats actually play with risk, not some random c4 guy who claims hes better than all of null while only ever undocking his two snakes.
---
people like me made the content for the 90% bottom feeding roaches in null alliances
---
Remember when they said they we're making a better system that would be better than the bug but instead they still kept skins on only select hulls and charged a ridiculous amount for them?
---
Name a more iconic duo than CCP Devs and outright lies.

I was when I had a whole day even several days playing it. And the game is a time burner. Almost every game style consume tons of time. However, manufacturing is indeed doable but need another several months to get the skills ready. :( so I'll just queue enough skills and wait for them to be ready. :p

WITH U BROTHER

Even deleifted my eve onlein isnteafgram!
---
Funny you should mention that. He doesnt do market stuff he just hides in null/lowsec and does indy sht to fund your trigger happy alliances.
---
Shhhht

Something something Battlefront
---
and my axe!!!

&gt; the difference between spelling mistake and typos.
---
Are you fucking with me right now?
---
I agree there are way too many people who forget they’re supposed to mind their language but you have to at least understand that you’re going to be called out on the ‘spelling errors’ in your own production.
---
In this place of all places.
---
Come on.
---
I -like- any player-created content. It makes the place come alive. It is gorgeous, smart, irreverent and wildly funny [not all at the same time, but you get the idea]. I don’t mean to rag on your production. I -want- you to be successful.
---
But the text mass is less than 20 words, can you not at least proof read your production before you post it? Seriously, that’s not ‘a high standard to attain’, that’s as basic as it gets.
---
I think its a little bit problematic how joe pubbie is continually willing to shell out for CCP y'all
---
Do you leave this subreddit two? Please say yes, because we enjoy our game here.
---
Are these real?
---
Am I seeing things? Gallente battleships that actually look sexy? Is this an alternative universe?
---
how about, I don't leave? is that ok?
---
Eve isn't your safe space and the Chinese get made fun of just like the Americans or Europeans. 
---
No one is getting arrested over EVE local spam and even if they were, then that would 100% be the fault of the Chinese government and not the EVE player.  
---
We're not going to censor memes for the benefit of an authoritarian government's insecurities.   
---
Also, let's be honest, look at your account, you're not making this argument in good faith anyway.
---
and NOW they'll be sorry!!!
---
GoTG was barely there, all I can find is some Russian jackdaw fleet. Slyce / Dark / RR, or the ones that actually matter were nowhere in sight.
---
Wallymarts can go even faster than that all by himself.
---
looks like I triggered the king roach, lulz
---
Should join init so it's only 3-1 before the batphones of daddy goons
---
Honestly I hope we keep the widow the same so I can continue to call my widow loving corpie a retard as I assert my Panther supremacy until I get a Redeemer.
---
Well done. Now stop trying to convince everyone else that they have your problems and get down the gym.
---
apparently thats you, since calling eve online a waste of time got your jimmies so rustled
