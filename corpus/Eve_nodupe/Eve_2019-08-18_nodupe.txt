The point is previous ship classes have a pattern where they cost about 10x more but only gain about double ehp. The gap between BS and cap/super is ridiculous compared to the gap from previous ship classes, even with price considered.
---
---
---
Lol tears. You've been crying for days now.
---
Who's going to war
---
Do most of these games have visibility from a lot of devs or just Harada level execs? I never followed Namco games closely but Capcom always seemed a little opaque aside from big announcements.
---
I found another X-L SMA nearby that had a Rorq in it but no drop, and then a third that only had a Tristan :(
---
So let's make a headcount : we have around what, 3000 titan pilots in the game, half of them being goons.
---

---
3000 titan pilots that will instantly be unsubbed if the ship becomes useless. That's around 300 to 400k lost a year for CCP (depending on subbed/plexed/people already unsubbed). And not even counting people that will totally leave the game and unsub their other account because the Titan is the closest thing we have as an endgame ship and people will be mad their efforts are wasted.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yea, right.
---
Is it viable to play not as part of a corporation? I tend to be a lone wolf in most games that I play but people seem to put a lot of importance on joining a corp in eve.
---
but small gangs can't kill anything, how did this happen?
---
You stand to make a lot of money by using your assets to kill and loot goons. Once they finally wise up, leave with the spoils.
---
He’s really trying to make a splash alright...
---
Not for the game of eve either,  i’d wager
---
lol
---
Coming back after a long break. No idea what is going on. What can I run the Triglavian "scout spotted" event sites in? Can I use a Vexor? I fly mostly Gallente and Amarr.
---
It was definitely due to the black out!  When local existed, offline SMAs would hide.
---
&gt;why park your super in a keepstar when you can lose it in a SMA?
---
Are you often in major battles ? Were you recently in any one of them ? Subcaps are needed on every fucking grid, in every major engagement. Because objectives, because you need to clear tackle, because you have to hold them in.
---
The ONLY cases where subcaps are somewhat useless are defensive citadels sieges, because a few titans can keep KS paused indefinitely, so you cannot ever win a defensive timer if the enemy fleet has a few titans more than you. And that could easily be fixed if CCP stopped taking time to make stupid decisions and actually fixed real issues like Citadel spam, fozzie sov, KS grid, FW, etc...
---
But noooo, people like saying subcaps are useless because we have a supercapital proliferation. Yes there is one, but subcaps are still important today. Stop trying to make a case about your roaming gang that got deleted by a Titan and that you wanted to be able to bother people more than that. Eve should never be balanced around small gangs, because fuck the 5 drunk guys that want to topple an entire alliance with their nanoshit, without making any kind of investment.
---
I saw an afk orca die to one today. I'm sold.
---
What!? Sounds like BOTS! No more exploiting dscan, remove it now!
---
It was a joke from Quake area but ok
---
This. If you get into an alliance system and 100 titans fucking kick you to the next region, that's your problem. You're not happy with this ? Bring more people and better ships next time, like actual thing that can threaten the local force. Play smart. Don't wait for CCP to bring you "balance" so you can start killing rorqual in peace : If that happens, there will be no rorqual, ever, in space. In fact, you won't see anyone PvE in nullsec anymore.
---
They seem to be particularly fascinated with scanning Upwell Structures... cue conspiracy theories about CCPs next move
---
Helo there i am the pilot who Jumped out the Hel too the TEST keepstar. ;p
---
Another nail in the coffin of ccp. Good work ccp good work. Fuck the small casual player
---
I almost puked at how retarded some of these are. The golden one for me is "Nerf subcap logi because lol explosion". Right, capping fleet at 5 logis will mean you will just take 5 more muninns.
---
It's a shame KF isn't allowed to scam.
---
Warping onto grid would give the defenders an almost insurmountable advantage in a Titan battle because of bubbles. Doubly so if they are warping in from different directions. I mean, the current state isn’t really any better, but something needs to be done to allow a cyno to be lit on grid with a hostile supercapital fleet that has subcap support. Doing this without allowing for hotdrops wont be easy
---
Fake news supers simply cannot lose to anything other than a cap fleet according to reddit
---
That was epic, and I was on the other side.
---
true since it wasnt lossed :p
---
That one is really retarded.
---
slurpsista tyllerö lääh puuh
---
They don't : If you are in a position to kill supers, their EHPs don't matter anyway. Sure it would allow for some odd kills where you left a titan at 20% hull but that's all. Capital fights make their HP go from 100 to 0 in any DD volley anyway.
---
Again, Subcaps vs Capitals is not balanced and is not meant to be : Capital escalation is the end game, if you want it gone, bring your own.
---
You meant the 4-5T of assets destroyed in 2 timers ? Is that not enough for you ?
---
Still doesn't change the fact CCP can't plan stick to a long term plan:
---
* tier-cide
---
* POS retirement
---
* Caps for all pirate factions
---
* Walking in stations
---
* DUST
---
Doesn't matter, you don't bring capitals to gain 4 min 30 sec faster reinforce time unless it's strategic then you would bring them anyway.
---
&lt;3
---
I know right - the ability to use cynos gave them invisibility, so OP.
---
Cynabal master race!
---
Do you even understand how that shit works ? Your cloak suggestion does not matter, it's useless.
---
You don't need to bubble the entire system, just the fucking grid. It takes less time to probe you and put stop bubble than capital to align to any fucking point in space.
---
No damn Supercapital FC is going to field 20T of assets on a random gamble.
---
This isn't a bad suggestion but I get the sense it's motivated more by salt than by a desire to push for good game design.
---
(I like to fuck with AP)
---
I wish they'd gone the modular route like they originally talked. Take different pieces and assemble your structure they way you wanted it to be, not this 3 sizes fits all model. I love the the interconnected modules you see in missions and plexes, those would have been what we were asking for!
---
Sorry to break it to you, but the Wormhole Generator™ is an exclusive property of Hard Knocks protected by copyright and intellectual property international laws.
---
That's fair, most of my experience is from lowsec where this is more of an issue. Where most groups fly mostly subcaps with the occasional few capitals, but snuff wanting to be the big fish in a small pond, has a great time denying content by dropping more supers the more people bring to defend, like you said whoever has more titans wins a timer, well snuff has more titans than any other lowsec entity. Also supercap umbrellas are a thing in lowsec for some reason, it frustrates me to no end seeing 3 rorquals just casually mining in lowsec knowing there's nothing anyone can do. 
---
I still think titans, and supers in general need to be relooked at what their roles are supposed to be. For example titans are ment to be flagships so focus their bonuses on boosts. No ship should be the solution to every/most problems.
---
no, what im saying is: dont be an idiot and AFK mine, keep an eye on the overview and local/Dscan when you are out doing things
---
Why does this 7 minute old post have gold on it? 
---
I wouldn't suggest an Ihub upgrade, but rather a navigation structure. Subspace gate or whatever. The only catch is you cannot control who uses it. 
---
Naturally, the WH crowd who like their safe space will descend and downvote.
---
Stainguy has a suggestion the other day to change the quantum flux generator to generate a long duration, infinite mass but mass limited wormhole to another null region. So for a week you get a uncontrollable wormhole between your space and another null region that only lets subcaps through.
---
If the semi-afk guys are 100 and the active one 5, yes ? StainGuy has a point (I can't believe i'm saying that) : People joining roaming gangs are way fewer than people willing to join real fleets, you can check that in any alliance.
---
If you remove any incentive for fleets outside of randoms citadel bash because you won't have a war due to CCP idleness on all matters, good luck keeping your pvp game afloat.
---
Chaos for thee not for me is what your post says. You are fine with ccp fucking up the current nullsec but want them to buff your play style and make it safer.
---
Yes, joining a corp is more of a lowest common denominator kind of thing for people who can't use google or set any goals for themselves.
---
If you stay in hisec and solo PvE with shit isk/h doing only pve content the chances you'll quit soon is very high, hence the whole corp thing.
---
yes please and that WH do not need to scan like drifter one
---
I spent a bit of time hunting them and found a dual rep, dual web, blaster VNI to be effective at both tanking the damage and quickly dispatching the Recon Damaviks.
---
Then don't come to nullsec space owned by huge coalitions ?
---
"We want fights that don't immediatly escalate..." Guess what dear, you don't have a say in this since you choose to come to someone's house and tried to put it on fire.
---
It’s also gameplay completely beyond most smaller groups on a player number basis. Many of us in those groups are already double/triple/quad boxing to scrape a 50 pilot fleet together. 
---
The whole point of nano gang is that it enables a numerically (often vastly) inferior group some hope of trading isk even/positive with a numerically superior opponent.
---
Only big bloc players throw the straw man of wanting small nano gangs to kill carriers out, it’s not the smaller groups.
---
Supercap umbrellas squeeze smaller engagements with a hope of victory out of the picture for the smaller group, which is bad for the game, because it means that scale snowballs positively mechanically as well as socially.
---
I bet the 4 year old's in that pic love it too! :)
---
Then again, attackers don't get to choose what defenders will put on field. it's not because smallgangers and WHers want "fair, winnable fights" that the defender will grant it to them.
---
This meme is worth 100 upvotes.
---
And there we are : "we are better than NS linemembers".  Guess what, they'll drop supers on you.
---
Or stop coming under umbrellas if they don't want to fights caps ?
---
probably gilded himself
---
Keepstars were a mistake
---
Probably not. You'll want something cruiser sized or larger with decent rep capabilities to survive the damage.
---
If you have multiple accounts, it might be tied to the account it was mailed to so won't show up if you're logged in as a different one.
---
I'm not sure that's good. They would have the benefit of a C5 farm static with the advantage of having citadels in nullsec. That's not going to be more content, just more isolated holes
---
Somewhere you're wrong. I got pointed and died. Either way. The tank you say wouldn't have saved me. Best beware.
---
I think the idea the OP has is that it will be "more content" through WH citadels being blown up by MJD ravens.
---
no km linked = no way to check your mistake.
---
And why would you get the honor of choosing how, when and what defense force are doing ?
---
You don't get to choose if response is subcap or capitals, you only get to choose what target you're engaging. If that's not okay with you : defenders don't care.
---
this except to c4s / c5s would be interesting
---
I kinda hoped the SOE titan or super would get a wormhole generator working like this
---
Synthesis league is a disaster of PoE, right after they gained a lot of players from D3 by Diablo Immortal incident and the introduction of Betrayal league. But luckily Legion league bring everyone back
---
that's neat
---
LOL
---
Then again, you came to their home, to throw them middle fingers by killing their ships. Why shouldn't they ruin your fun in any way they want ?
---
They lost 16 capital ships and you think they might have run out?
---
I think you underestimate how much money they still have :-)
---
What should you be doing?
---
well nullsec has no response to the rage roll - find target, if target = good, keep, other = rage roll next hole... this would be the counter or at least a repercussion for any wormhole group that attacks a group
---
Ok so if we create bots or just gather enough people to flood reddit with topic like “bombers OP, pls nerf”, they will immediately focus on them?
---
It's "fite over" for your small gang, not for organized fleets. That's the point, you don't get to be able to inflict huge damage to big organization without even working for it.
---
You don't like caps ? Bring dreadbombs.
---
You make a fair point and I just got done talking with another Goon about how super carriers already have 80% of the HP of a Titan yet are 1/4 of the cost ( assuming both are doctrine fit ). Although the tank at that point isn't the only issue but a causation of the severely increased damage in capital class ships; my Hel for example with Anti-cap bombers sits around ~19k dps and I believe dreads sit around 9-12k. So at that point it becomes hard to balance do we balance super carriers around capital vs capital engagements or do we balance them sub capitals.
---
We're currently in the capital vs capital and I don't think it would be smart with the shear amount of capitals the game has right now to balance the ehp around capital vs sub-capital engagements as supers and titans would just be too fragile at that point. If people want to see more supers die and get on the shiny kill mails that they are, ccp needs take a look at why null truly is stagnant right now which is another topic all in itself.
---
I heard you can go blind doing that
---
Fair enough, I concede your point and concur. "Interesting" is a better description.
---
tbf a lot of people underestimate that. hell at this point there are people who dont even know the hyperkrab behemoth that was the DRF anymore.
---
No, it doesn’t need to be any easier to get to deep jspace, the mass and navigation limitations define the environment.
---
Anyone that gets a connection to such a connected system would just roll the hole away, and all the null folk would use up the sites in hours, then would have no further use to them.
---
With the current state of things the null blocks do not need to be given any tools to mess with jspace after fucking themselves into the situation where major mechanic changes where needed to keep things moving.
---
That's just spiteposting. Even the shittiest null alliance like Darkness. or something can pull together unfightable numbers for an "average" c5 group. Whichever WH group that say, gets an unclosable hole from their home to 1DQ instant gets evicted with no counterplay.
---
does pyfa take the diminishing return in account?
---
tfw krabs are so lazy, they can't even be arsed to scan a WH.
---
Titans being changed to boost ships will mean you just deleted 3000 accounts from this game. Titans are way more balanced since the HAW nerf, unless you're part of a 8 men caracal gang or something.
---
Lowsec is specific in the fact that you cannot ever prevent supers to land on grid, bubbles being impossible to use there. Then again, if Snuff want to play the big dog and has the weapons to do so, I don't see a problem. We got evicted from Tribute and Vale because goons are way more than us and have more titans, ok we lost, end of story.
---
I agree with you tho, Titans and supers in lowsec are way more oppressive, just deactivate their guns and fighters in lowsec (so they can still move through), problem solved.
---
It may create corps/ally live both in NS and wh.
---
But you can hardly outsmart a cap escalation. They all jump at the same time, you can't out escalate them, you can't outsmart them. Individually they are all very strong, they can make so many mistakes the small gang couldn't even notice. The one true mistake is to move the cap outside of jump range of others
---
Why would they go and hunt under umbrellas for isk positive engagements?  
---
That’s nonsensical

But you can, fatigue exists for a reason. Just try guerilla tactics for some time, you'll eventually have a gang going out to remove you, because umbrella pilots are tired of you fleeing the scene every time they jump in.
---
But then again it takes commitment, which most of nullsec hunters are not willing to make because defenseless targets are way better.
---
Evictions take a week at least, though, because Citadel timers.
---
hey ccp can you make fw mechanic not so damn boring for solo players?
---
It's not fun to sit on something for 9 minutes then get killed. Sometimes the reward is shit, more often than not if you're trying to pvp and get money your boredom will get farmed by snaked ships
---
Me too.
---
Yes yes wormhole are very safe, please move your billions inside wormholes and farm with them. All your investments are safe
---
who said anything about shitty change?
---
I said the best we can expect is low effort change.  And it seems like they have changed from "let's ruminate on this for a long time first" to "let's iterate as much and as fast as possible".
---
What is NOT going to happen is great, well thought out, changes that require a lot of coding because I just don't think they have the bandwidth for that.
---
Does anyone have some useful links video for industry? my items are not selling on the market? if so where do i put them on sell?
---
I told some people to try that - the usual answer is that goons have many caps ready to go. And you don't need much caps to scare off *any* small to med gang. And if they escalate? You have a long time to ping, undock everyone and simply jump there and escalate to a 200 cap fight, without any coordination effort, just a cyno.
---
&gt; Or we just spread out some more.
---
I am not sure you meant it, but this is the very definition of nerfing the umbrella's utility.
---
It's interesting, I think having a subcap only wormhole to another nullsec region is more interesting. But it reduce the concept of territory and I don't like that much
---
I don’t know many wormholes who would be opposed to null bears running sites in their homes. I for one welcome any ratter to take full advantage of the combat anoms in my wormhole free of charge.
---
I don't get it either, as long as the cool down is in play, who cares how many you have spread out around the galaxy. It could only provide more content
---
From what I gather it's the PvPers that are most happy with recent changes
---
it's their own fault if these noob loser wormholers don't get more friends!!!!1
---
I would love it, especially if they tried to do it in my home system. Bob is pleased by a daily sacrifice after all
---
what's the difference b/t that and 30 lokis hitting a rorqual (which is techincally unfightable numbers for the rorqual)?
---
Its almost as if there's other playstyles beyond being a mega-alliance line member. Go figure. The changes before blackout were fine because they didn't affect you negatively in any way, but now we get changes that adapt the climate of the game to accomodate multiple play styles and there's suddenly something wrong with that. Shouldn't take a dread bomb to gank a ratting subcap. Do you see a problem with your logic or do you just want to rat/mine in complete safety and claim there's nothing wrong with that because it's "your space"?
---
so you want wormholes to be EVEN MORE SAFE
---
Awesome read thanks for posting!
---
not enough to matter.
---
Ctrl+F9, my dude
---
I don't believe so. I just tested it and each rep adds the same amount.
---
Yeah, its like they don't know that we rat in our statics and not in our home holes.
---
The shitposters
---
This is what I wish I did. Asset safety can be a bitch.
---
Shh, let the wormholes be overlooked. It's better this way.
---
Oh ok. I'd heard about the null blackout I just didn't think about a lot of the effects it would have. Incursions or maybe exploration always seemed to me like viable ways of subbing. Are either of those on the table?
---
He knows Matterall, man. It's not a scam!
---
I keep seeing all this “wormholers are gonna get hit by chaos too”
---
Oh please let it happen. I beg for roaming drifters in wormholers. Make our lives harder. Plssss
---
Most of use lived in a pos for years. I don’t think you can make our lives harder than it’s been before without also making us VERY excited at the same time.
---
If its just for PVE, make it go to Abyssal space. No need to totally fuck up the game balance of wh space.
---
If wormhole krabbing is so safe and profitable, and you are so buttmad that your risk vs reward in nullsec is ‘too risky’ for the reward, why not just move to a wormhole and make all this easy isk??
---
Either you're being purposely misleading, intentionally obtuse, or actually don't know the difference between 'content' and 'obstruction to play-style'. I tend to think the best of others, so I'm going to lean that you don't see the disruption/obstruction of a play-style as a problem. Likely, it isn't your play-style, or you hold the belief that it "Is Not The Right Way To Play". Some of what you said is good content, others are not. You shouldn't need my help to figure it out.
---
Blops dropping on blops that get counter dropped by more blops.
---
Throw them the middle finger? I'm trying  to PvP and seek out fights. If you don't catch something people dock up and "deny content". I fly a frigate to tackle ratters, it takes me a while to chip away at a cruiser/battlecruisers eHP, plenty of time for a fleet to respond. Frat is particularly tough to poke at because they have a response fleet and people who actually play with others (hint: eve is an MMO) As a solo/small gang PvPer how should I find content? Ask for an arranged fight? You'll find that people always bring the counter to your ship or they bring friends if you give them the chance. So, middle finger? No. Trying to roam and PvP? Yes.
---
Hard knocks still exists?
---
Says you lmao
---
They take a decent time to train into, are pretty squishy unless you have decent support skills, and will die a lot more often. AKA inject into more alts.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Naturally, the WH crowd who like their safe space will descend and downvote.
---
You don't really "get" wormholes huh
---
i been advocating for cyno spool ups, with caps having it at 1minute, so u need to light early or make sure you kill the inhib before it goes up
---
Wow remote cap transfer too. This could be really important for spidertanking things. Oh actually the details are complicated https://www.eveonline.com/article/pobbb9/spring-balance-update-incoming
---
Is this update already on tranquility? There are a lot of changes
---
No idea why you're being downvoted. Everything you did was part of the game and in no way even griefing from what you said. If they couldn't financially or emotionally afford to lose their assets they shouldn't have left a station.
---
Praise be!
---
while i would appreciate more null connections, i dont really know if this would be good for j-space...
---
i live in jspace because the fights are smaller. because each individual pilot is more important. tight knit group working together fighting together sometimes up to multiple hours. 
---
with each side having 20-30 real players involved.
---
rarely any wormholer is interested in tidi blobfests...
---
so i dont really think it would lead to a great outcome linking  groups that are able to form fleets of 100s within a couple minutes to that..
---
Well then I just reported you for a low effort meme.
---
Interesting...
---
Me: *Points out alternative source of materials and a point in EVE history in which this was the MAIN source of materials*
---
You: Omigod troll!!
---
Do you have an actual point?
---
Wormholes have been chaos since day 1, the rest of the game is just catching up and wondering why we haven't been whining about it.
---
You actually have to protect your cyno alt now, instead of murderizing it yourself as soon as you finish jumping your carrier. Now there's actual costs associated with jumping capitals
---
....Not at all.
---
There is a whole spectrum of defending oneself and it is based on the effort and planning required.
---
Would you say having a module that instantly kills the attackers is the same as having to coordinate 100 people to move 10 systems to repell attackers?
---
Are those the same exact thing to you?
---
Because he can't move in his army of supers and titans.
---
Remember when xdeath, Solar, -A-, coven etc controlled half of the eve map? 
---
I guess the Chinese will be the new Russians now in eve eventually.
---
Perhaps the above changes, coupled with a new cyno module for caps without the aforementioned penalties. New module could only be fit in caps, and you still get your titans like the days of old?
---
Well you aren’t wrong
---
Stukas offline cloaks though.
---
The economy would be very different, but that isn't the argument they made.
---
Yup, that's all cool, and I am not going to complain about the slave labour, but that doesn't mean I have to encourage them to trade their lives for dirt.
---
Your argument is so good.
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
---
It would mostly be used to farm wormhole space more safely.
---
The same question could be asked of command destroyers or interdictors.
---
Should all subcaps be able to boosh or insta bubble?  
---
I think not.  Being able to drop a fleet from light years away need to have tradeoffs.
---
If it's so stupidly obvious, why are you having such a hard time putting it into words?
---
I dunno, seems pretty simple to me. Instead of simply “warp fleet to contested structure” you just warp to your eyes at the range you want, offset away from the bubbles. Yeah, you can fuck up, and it might cause ships to die. That’s what eve is about. It’s not a gamble if you do it properly.
---
Exploration is the same afaik. Incursions have been restricted to only one area and now there's trig invasions where I guess the others would be. All I really know about those is it's possible to ninja salvage them to take the the loot.
---
Wasnt talking about the keepstar.
---
Coming soon to a goon keepstar near you, cynos with fax support.
---
&gt;competent 
---
Yes, flying a capital in a capital fleet against a subcapital fleet takes a lot of skill and big brain power.
---
Dude, I'm on your side, but saying it's totally uncounterable isn't particularly accurate.
---
The issue isn't that it's uncounterable, but that the counters are poor quality and extremely high effort by comparison to the action they counter.
---
Oh they definitely do, and  thats not true in most cases, their Ehp absolutely matters.  How often do doomsday volleying really happen and even in those situations youll notice only some titans die and it takes quite a large amount of DDs it seems.  
---
Subcaps versus caps SHOULD be balanced better and NO you shouldnt HAVE to bring your own to kill them.  thats just bad game design.
---
Oh boy, aren’t you entitled?  Gonna unsub your 26 accounts if you can’t drop bosons without risk?
---
&gt; You cant get ice or gas from loot. Both are needed for ships.
---
You should go check that t1 industry tab again, buddy.
---
&gt; And say good by to capitals.
---
Capitols take PI materials, not ice or gas.
---
&gt; And how am I slave labor? Because I mine on occasion and make isk doing it?
---
If you can call THAT isk.
---
There is opportunity cost. Why spend hours making maybe 50m an hour when there are easy ways to make 800m+ an hour?
---
Whichever you like.
---
It's only slightly better.
---
But also that isn't the argument being presented.
---
where do you get them?
---
&gt; thousands of dreads a month
---
uhh ok, buddy
---
Also, even dread bombs can't kill a rorqual under a super umbrella
---
Unfortunately the majority of the j-space guys are trying to force the small-gang pvp on other groups who don't necessarily care about small gang pvp, so since they want that this would give a quicker access for nullsec groups to provide said small gangs for pvp.
---
well that's what this suggestion is about!!
---
The bears are out in force tonight, eh?  Mayne they dont like that I flipped the table on family game night lol... its Reddit, who cares? ♡
---
They would pay for it by losing 120 dreads, which is likely way more than they killed
---
whoa man this is only trying to expedite the interaction process of null and wormhole guys
---
Isn’t texas law enough?
---
What is cap dumping??
---
no, it's perfect.
---
we can just jump clone to other null sec regions, we want to be able to take small gang stuff to wormholes!
---
Don't worry people, I speak 傻瓜, I know what this means!
---
He's saying he's too lazy to scan and spend the effort to live in wormholes because wormholes are scary.
---
I left after Betrayal, but gave it a week. Couldn't do it. Glad to hear they're getting back on track. But Delve &lt;3
---
the jokes on your because the alt can fly both.
---
International law IS Texas law.
---
I was actually very surprised no one made the connection earlier
---
Well, like any universe, you start with the rookie ship, then the career agent gives you a combat ship, then you do missions and such to get materials and isk to get a t1 destroyer blueprint and the minerals to make it, then cruiser, then battlecruiser, then battleship, so on and so forth.
---
Obviously you get the ships the same place you get the first mining ship.
---
It is the dumbest idea CCP has ever come up with. It isn't crying at all, just pointing out obvious facts.
---
I will still move my capitals, no problem. The issue is far reaching, but fools such as yourself are too stupid to see it.
---
I'm literally alone in a brick tanked Command Ship. And they run away. They can kill me, but they are gonna have to work for it, and a few may die, so they will not engage.
---
The obvious reason is that they are ships designed for recon and repositioning.
---
But yeah, maybe too restrictive.
---
The pendulum swings
---
Just as good as yours!
---
Well capitals can't jump to the covert cyno.
---
The agenda is to not see the game die.
---
This is what I've wanted to do every time I scouted a blops drop, but they always dropped way more blops than we had.
---
Thanks for the Nyx kill friends!
---
I would engage you all night long bby. &lt;3 thanks for coming in a subcap that's all I care about.
---
First actual LOL in a long time ♡
---
or just warp a dictor to the cyno and bubble it.
---
now, t1ds kill their fair share of navy-faction-t2 frigs
---
I provided points....you just insulted...
---
not in wormholes they don't, unless they time all their citadels to a different day of the week. YOu can kill a jspace structure in 3 days
---
The fuck outta here with that LoGiC
---
the fact that you even have to ask this question just illustrates your stupidity even more than the original post. lmao.
---
I am not saying to berate them. But when you ask a question and the person replies in such a manner that it is obvious they are brushing aside an issue, or misstate a fact, it is the responsibility of the journalist to push back on the interviewee and have them explain themselves. It also helps if the interviewer has some level of expertise (Matterall does not) in the subject matter in order  to be able to provide counterpoints. THAT is the Walter Kronkite way of journalism.
---
Pretty easy to call your shit spin when you're admitting you don't actually know what's going on. Nice one lol.
---
EDIT - Love how I get downvoted for agreeing lol.
---
Capcom is pretty awful, and a lot of the anime fighters can be hit and miss. A big part of the transparency, though, is because of how close knit a lot of dev's are with the community, imo. Many of them grew up playing these games that are now working on them. Soulcalibur 5, for example, had a pro player as the lead designer, and competitively, it was super ahead of it's time, imo. Frame data (fighter stats) made way more coherent sense than most games of the time, and that really came from not just the dev being a player, but from talking to the other pros, and we're seeing that attitude across the board now with competitive fighters.
---
Yeah, this is live
---
Definitely looks like crying to me. Crying and getting angry.
---
I believe so. I like that caps can't light their own cyno to save their ass when they fuck up. That should remain. It shouldn't be limited to two ship types. I think cruisers to battleships should be able to light them. That gives cheap mobile options and high tank options. Maybe needs to scale down to BCs but that is tweaking that can be done later. I'm indifferent about the covert cyno jf thing
---
Were you around during the days of Combat Refitting?
---
Many people argued that it was a 'high-skill' tactic that seperated experienced players from the rest.
---
CCP removed it. There's now no tactical mechanic to separate good capital pilots from bad ones. What motivates people to progress further once they have Injected Fighters V, and Tactical Logistics Reconfiguration V?
---
Nothing. 
---
Adding an extra mountain for cap pilots to climb means new players can play in the shade. If that mountain needs to be climbed daily, then it can be no more than a small hill.
---
Are you new to the game or something?  This is really basic.
---
So when you jump to a cyno, you has some random chance to be at some random location within a sphere some fixed radius (5k?, I don't remember) from the cyno.
---
So when a bunch of caps all jump to the same beacon, all those ships, which are defined as a hit box with some set dimensions, spawn within the same sphere.
---
The ones that have overlapping hit boxes go flying off in random directions (It's not actually random, but as far as we're concerned, they might as well be).  As soon as the ships that didn't fly off in random directions start aligning, the start bumping off each other.
---
A lot of times you have to manually pilot (gasp!! A F1 monkey actually double clicking in space) to get untangled from the fuck pit of supers, and doing 110 m/s in a ragnorok, that shit takes forever.
---
Do Goons not already control Querious?  Sure there’s the “QFC” but they live there at the behest of Goons, right?
---
Not to me you didn't.
---
Perhaps I'm the crazy one here, but does it not seem **incredibly** entitled to think you should be able to freely stroll into someone else's house, fuck with their stuff, and then bitterly complain about being met with a 'fuck off' level of retaliation? 
---
I'm not about to type out the novel that it would require to fully explain, but while your proposal sounds better on the surface, the end result is still the same: all advantages are given to the gankers in a post-blackout world, even if you apply the same rule to Covert Cynos. 
---
If you then go on to remove capitals' ability to apply to subcaps, you will have basically removed null PvE unless it is done in groups large enough to discourage attack. In which case, the complaint once again goes back to the older days of bitching about "dirty blobbers" instead of "dirty caps" as people continue to fail to find targets they're willing to engage.
---
None of what you've said is applicable. Nobody is brushing anything aside or hiding anything. You guys need to stop with the paranoid conspiracy theories. It really makes you look like a bunch of fucking nutjobs. Seriously, get help
---
Literally the opposite of what is happening now.
---
Seems he finally found sense, or gave full control to someone who does.
---
Nope, not in the slightest lol.
---
Here, I will say it in a manner you can understand. Matterall would be a better interviewer if he got CCPs cock out of his mouth.
---
unless the passive shield recharge is higher than the frig's dps
---
Because it's kinda like wiping your ass.
---
You know how to do it. When someone handed you a piece of toilet paper, you just kinda knew what to do with it, but to someone who's never done it before, you couldn't really tell them how to do it.
---
The costs are one thing for 250-man dread fleets but really inconvenient for solo pilots who miss the moveop and get their dread stranded. We need a non-combat alternative that doesn't run 300mil.
---
You can already do that...
---
Oh look a retard, and his flair checks out
---
Cap dumping is a manual piloting technique that allows you to warp only partway to a destination. The basic principle is: every time you press warp, your ship loses the capacitor required to make the warp. Longer warps require more capacitor than shorter warps. You can empty your ship of capacitor by repeatedly warping, then immediately stopping your ship to cancel the warp; you can make this go faster by turning on your active modules.
---
Eventually, you will not have enough capacitor to make the warp. You may have seen what happens when your ship doesn't have enough capacitor to warp (common if you warp a few times in very large systems like Thera). The game will tell you that you don't have enough cap to warp the full distance, and you will proceed to warp in the direction of your selected destination, but you will only travel a part of the way to your destination; the distance you travel is based on the amount of cap that you had left. Once you land the game will then start up another warp to cover the remaining distance, but you can stop your ship and prevent this (you can do this during the warp, to be safe). This can be done in any ship that doesn't enter warp instantly; I'm not sure if it works in pods. It is easiest in ships that don't have all that much capacitor, like frigates, but I have certainly performed it in cruisers, though it takes longer to empty the tank. There is a danger in ships that align quickly that you can fail to stop your ship before it enters warp; turning on an MWD or AB increases align time and can help mitigate this, as well as use up cap more quickly.
---
Cap dumping is a very useful skill for anyone traveling in hostile space.  Often you need to get into d-scan range of a celestial, but you don't want to warp directly to the celestial and there are no convenient objects within scan range. A common instance of this is when there is a stargate that just happens to be more than 14.3 au from anything else in system, and you need to figure out if it is bubbled. By cap dumping, you can warp in the direction of the stargate, but not actually warp *to* the stargate; you will end up traveling only a part of the distance to the gate, hopefully close enough to use d-scan. The skill itself is very easy to learn; I would recommend any player who doesn't know about it to spend 5 minutes in space practicing.
---
You've definitely fooled me. You sound pretty upset man.
---
I mean.... Yes and no. While I do think the idea is good a 300m ship is a bit steep. They made the monitor for some reason, why not make a 100m isk cyno ship
---
You're perfectly able to take small gang stuff to wormholes with existing mechanics.
---
All I know is what I see, like you guys sitting at 100 doing nothing but bitching in local when you could of spearfished nightmares for days with how open they were at times.(like one sitting afk on the mino when we were 30k from it. Easy spear out of fax range).
---
Then bitch on reddit about a fight were you complained they couldn't fight you when they killed their obj while you guys just sat there doing nothing. 
---
Even with a blob on standby you could of done something but you just sat there to whore on the fort while making a excuse to again do nothing could of got picks and left when the blob arrived since there was one.
---
CCP nerfs things, players cry about nerfs.  CCP buffs things, players cry about power creep.  They’ll never make everyonebhappy.
---
Why not quickly make a safe instead? 
---
I dont see the point in stranding yourself short of a celestial with no cap.. what are you supposed to do when you get there?
---
Same thing happened to me on the last one. Tried it with all my accounts and no luck.
---
Contacted Support and they said I actually was not eligible and that it was sent to me by mistake, and gave me 8 extra days if i bought one month.
---
I mean, thanks for the long well thought out response... I just... but why not just use the tracking camera and scan as you're flying through the system??
---
Jump clones have a cool-down that wormholes don’t have.
---
&gt; the majority of the j-space guys
---
i hope you are aware that c5/c4s dont have null statics right?
---
the ''bad wh guys'' forcing you to drop supers on their 20men gangs dont live there... completely ignoring the fact that alot of guys MOVED to jspace because roaming in general is completely fucked with boson/super gatecamps and whatnot.
---
so if your goal is to target those bad 20men wh guys, this would be a complete miss....
---
Also, can we make it so the other upgrades in the same region don't open to the same location? That way we get lots and lots and lots of opportunities to interact with the best of the best?
---
Recons, blops and dreads, and you got me.
---
I thought fax would be better at first, because of its limited use to krabs, but then I realized that the first thing you would jump to a rorq save would be a fax anyway, so that wouldn't solve anything.
---
Dreads though, the only place you krab with dreads is wormholes, and you can't light cynos there anyway. Letting dreads hard cyno wouldn't really help krabs out too much, especially if you tied cyno use to the effectiveness of HAWs.
---
\&gt; The general consensus on those changes is pretty clear. Killing frigates with capitals/supercaps/titans is generally frowned upon unless skillful smartbomb plays are made. 
---
The question is not if the changed were liked, but if they were meaningful. The two are not tied together.
---
Yes.  Cynos need to be restricted, but moving a suitcase carrier shouldn't cost more in cyno lossmails than the carrier.  Hard cynos (as in &gt;3m ehp, ideally &gt;15m) are needed for fleet fights to happen.  Welcome to the world of no large battles, and the only way to move a without costing 300m / jump is to downtime tank the cyno.    
---
They could have raised the fitting reqs or fuel need to keep it off of frigates.  
---
They could have left it on the Fax, or ideally the aeon / wyvern.  
---
They could have introduced a new type of cyno that collapses after one jump for solo movers.  
---
and on and on and on....  
---
Seriously, there are so many options here and CCP went with the one that creates more problems than it solves.
---
how about a lowsec anchorable that generates a single wormhole connection to nullsec
---
&gt;So much this.  Give the t2 explo frigates a one-shot cyno that collapses after the jump and still suspends the ship for \~30-60 seconds afterwords.  Bam, solo movers solved and cyno vigils solved.  Covert theme still sticks.
---
I think giving recon a module similar to assault damage control could remove all your worries? Of simply add an attribute on cyno to greatly enhance ship defense for a short periods?
---
&gt; You're sincerely part of the problem if you can't see why a single module and ship class appears on grid and it's "fites over".
---
This is not unique to capitals, Eve is a game of counters. This occurs whenever a hard-counter to whatever you're flying undocks or lands on-grid.
---
&gt;Pandemic horde started a program that if their members defend ratters and miners and get kills in defense of those ratters/miners, they get an isk reward for securing their space. There's a reason PH is known for good fights. They bring subcaps, they kill shit and they get killed. Win some, lose some and it's always fun.
---
I mean, good for them that they choose to be so obliging, but if you're engaging in another group's territory, the level of response *should* be up to them and you should consequently accept that. 
---
For example, Liberty Squad somewhat recently dropped Dreads against Snuff running Machs/Triage in their hometown, and we accepted that they'd be dropping Titans in response. We knew they were online, and they were in no way required to give us a fair fight. We still managed to have a good time, and didn't fly to reddit to angrily post through tear-filled eyes that it's unfair for someone to be able to instantly drop 35 Titans on our heads when we just wanted a 'gudfite' in the space they controlled.
---
I mean, we walked into **their** house and started breaking their shit. Why would we expect anything different? Why do you?
---
Thanks. BTW did they add Hilde yet b/c I'm still waiting for her
---
Just turn all of highsec into null if that's the case.
---
&gt; just a bunch of spergy ass mouth breathers trying to scream over top of one another and see who could shit talk the most.
---
Sure you didn't get cable news by mistake?
---
now this is a good post.
---
This trolling is old
---
Why do you feel that you should be able to freely gank any ratting subcap you happen to come across?
---
There are no stations... use asset safety
---
Pretend for a second cynos didn't exist and capitals like all other ships had to take gates. Then someone makes a thread and says: "hey guys I think it would be really cool if the strongest and most powerful ships were able to teleport across huge distances so they could provide backup instantly". I think everyone would agree that's a terrible game balance decision. Why should the biggest and most powerful ships be able to travel faster than any other ship, the trade off for being large and powerful is suppose to be speed (and damage application, but drones ruin that too). 
---
The jump drive was a terrible idea for game balance, but because capitals were so rare and expensive in the past it wasn't abused that much and it was accepted into the game. Now capitals are cheap and everyone has one, so we need to deal with cynos. Making it so that moving a capital carries a large financial risk is a great step towards making other ship types relevant again.
---
I think it is. Idea is good but implementation seems too fast. Restricting cyno from everything to one ship class only (BLOPS aren't that viable IMO) is too harsh. They could have done it over 2-3 patches, restricting more and more.
---
So do you talk to people with sneering condescension IRL too or just reserve it for forums about pixel spaceships?
---
So you think there should only be PvP when it's over objectives and arranged fights/duels/skirmishes? The game would be much better for you if you could only attack and be attacked when you "consented" huh? Like a PvE server? What a joke.
---
First off reread my comment  I mentioned pi and we already acknowledged there would still be t1. But t2 requires gas. And merc which good luck getting enough of that from rats. 
---
And why does it matter that I only make 80 to 100 idk an hour when mining. I doing something I enjoy. By your logic we should all be doctors irl becuase they make the most money. But not everyone wants to be a doctor some people enjoy gardening and become florists. As long as I am having fun I dont give a damn if I make 30mill or 300mill in the hour I am doing it. I pvp when I want to pvp I rat when I want to rat. And I mine when I want to mine. At the end of the day it's my playstyle. And you biting on YouTube isn't going to change that.
---
The tracking camera doesn't help you if you can't get within 14.3 au of the celestial. It's about being in range of d-scan in the first place. There are systems with stargates that truly can't be scanned as you fly between any other celestial. Imagine a system where basically every celestial is on a single plane, except for a single stargate that is 30 au directly above the plane. There are systems like this and those stargates are impossible to get into d-scan range any other way.
---
I just think it shoulda been cynos on combat recons and cov on force recons.
---
^--this was the case for me
---
What kind of mineral is Legitamite?
---
sorry to break it to you... hard knocks needs a penis augmentation in order to posses anything...they can only fight bots in k-space and do kneel every time before Imperium Legacy when crossing Northern wall. 
---
So far they can't enforce any mentioned international laws and neither they can project or claim any right on such ownership. But nice try though :D
---
You scan the celestial you needed to scan. You make a safe, as this sort of spot is basically a gate ping. You chill out and get your cap back, since you're pretty safe at that spot; as long as you stay there you'll only get caught by combat probes or someone getting a lucky drive-by safe drop. And lastly, you evaluate the results of your d-scan, and act from there. The alternative is warping to the stargate completely blind as to what you'll find when you land.
---
Great show guys!
---
Hey man, while I realize you like swinging your freakishly gigantic penis around, there are less fortunate individuals that would like to swing their own Moderately Large penises around and feel like a king too.
---
Right on, thanks for the pro tip :)
---
What kills do I need?
---
(thanks!)
---
Or my personal idea, a "logistics cyno" that works as well as current ones except it offlines all your cap's modules when you jump to it so it's useless for fighting
---
that would also be very neat
---
totally - if a wormhole is opened to a c4/c5 it can't be generated by any other structure in the region
---
so it wouldn't be an issue then right?!
---
I think cheap cynos have their place. I'd like a t2 cyno frig that can only fit a mwd with no nullification and like 2k ehp.
---
Anything that sneezes on it will kill it  and it has the place of cheap cynos.
---
You are correct that trig gatecamps only happen in invasion areas, but I don't think it works per constellation like the sansha ones do, it seems to work vs distance towards the surrounding systems and also how 'advanced' the invasion system is. Anyway, sansha incursion rats don't scram on gates in highsec, or at least I've never seen them on gates in high. Trigs also don't *seem* to point or scram on gates, but I'll keep acting like they do so I don't get surprised.
---
In the systems with recon damaviks, they just seem to be floating about randomly. I've seen them happily sit on a structure for a while scanning it, then zoom off in a random direction. I don't know where they go or what they do exactly, but for now I'd assume if you're in a highsec system, you're going to have occasional visitors. The recons don't point or scram, so unless you're flying paper, you *can* run away from them.
---
Now, two caveats I want to point out as to *why* I might have a incorrect impression wrt the trigs that do gatecamping.
---
First, I mostly fly either blockade runners or a dst while cloak+mwd'ing - this means whenever I'm in a system with the rats, they don't get the opportunity to shoot me. This means I don't really know how *strong* the damage is coming from them as compared to my ship's tank, and I also don't know for absolute certainty that they don't point/scram.
---
Second, I have had friends who claimed they've had their battleships, freighters, and other large things turned inside out in the bbq free for all that results if you try to afk through one of these invasion systems. Supposedly the trigs individually hit quite hard, and I've personally seen them blob gates with many frigates and cruisers.
---
You might have noticed a trend there. I don't afk haul. The one time I had the autopilot on in game was the first time I've been ganked, and the last either of those two things happened.
---
You don't want to be connected to C4 space.
---
or maybe I just don't want to live in wormholes, just as wormholers don't want to live in nullsec
---
This. So much this!
---
They mostly drop nothing, but can drop Trig data sheets to sell to Concord, skillbooks, calm filaments, or even just cheap meta junk modules (not sure why, unless they're supposed to have looted them from afk newbs 😉). The salvage can be good though.
---
I spent a few hours hunting them on dscan last night, and ended up with probably just over 200mil in loot. To some in hisec that'd be a small fortune, I was just curious to see if they could be 'cleared out' - but from my brief experiment it seems they just keep spawning.
---
The difference is 30 lokis can't break a decent rorq.
---
EVE is a dark and harsh world, you’re supposed to feel a bit worried and slightly angry when you log in, you’re not supposed to feel like you’re logging in to a happy, happy, fluffy, fluffy lala land filled with fun and adventures, that’s what hello kitty online is for." - CCP Wrangler
---
Robo, just say you miss me. No need to cloak it in some odd mechanic. I know you and your goonies are still lost on the way to burn hs/twist the knife/bend the knee/roll over for a purple nerple. What’s it been a month since you started that whole deal?
---
if they were damage fit yes they can, but they are probably nano kitey shit that nothing can kill but don't do enough damage
---
You already don't HAVE to, a group of 5 loki's can man handle a normal carrier. For supers it's the same process but more ships, already see fleets of 100-200 bombers roaming around looking for super kills; do you need 200 bombers to kill a super? no but it makes it a hell of a lot quicker and you can be guaranteed to keep that supers cap dead.
---
I don't think needing some numbers in order to kill a brick tanked anything let alone something called a super is all that nuts :P sounds kinda correct.
---
I think giving t1 cynos to two type of ships that already had covert cynos is too restrictive. Only put cynos on a t2 hull that doesn't have it Or a t3 frigate, or introduce a new t2 hull just for this.  Also, Marauders should be able to have them as well if Blops can. Hac, Hics, Muraders, and electronic attack ships.This will put 4 ships in each of the empire races and soon to put one or two in the triglavian race.
---
This has to be the dumbest comment in this thread and that's pretty impressive, even for you.
---
i could answer with a somewhat reasonable answer/post just like i did above... but since its you (BBTB2) i dont really care. in the end it comes down to salt/troll/shitpost anyways so yeah...
---
The point is not to have cheap high tank options. That's a buff lol.
---
With a cyno active you can't receive reps.
---
TBH that's one good idea I've read amidst all of the screeching.
---
this will hurt the small guys more
---
I don't expect shit to be fair, I'll always expect more forces than I have when we roam into someone else's home space. But it's my opinion that dropping caps is anti-fun (goons motto). It's also my opinion that the ability to move caps so freely and easily needed a change, and it looks like ccp believed that as well. ;)
---
Also, even in systems where you can do a drive-by scan, I often prefer to cap dump instead of doing a drive-by scan, for a few reasons. For one, I might be in a system that is sufficiently dangerous that I want to avoid being at a warpable celestial as much as possible. If I do a drive-by scan in a system I've never visited before, this will usually require me to make warps to at least two celestials - that's two times when I am at a location that anyone else in system can warp to. Your first drive-by scan also has a chance to reveal where you are if you're not cloaked, and you will be landing at a warpable object at its conclusion. Instead I can make a mid safe and cap dump from the mid safe - this only requires me to warp once to a celestial to make the mid safe, and I have pretty much complete freedom in where I make the safe, which can be important for concealing your presence as much as possible. Drive-by scanning is convenient when it works, but if you have time and safety is a priority then cap dumping is generally the superior way to get a scan on a gate.
---
Nahh, I'm all good
---
They're near comically safe now. Unless you're gating a freighter or a cap it's currently almost impossible to catch people on ansiplex gates.
---
Let's make the game even more reliant on multiboxing!
---
Dear CCP, please proceed with cyno changes. Everyone crying about lack of escalation etc, get this: there won't be another huge escalated cap on cap fight for a long time because one side makes up 80% of null. It has nothing to do with you CCP, but lack of balls and willingness to blue whatever you can that is the cause of stagnation.
---
Next change should impact that. Depleting resources + reseouce generation based in ADMs.
---
&gt; Then people with thousands of cynos that they already own would see an artificial increase and probably wreck the economy? That’s one of the stupidest things I think I’ve ever heard. 
---
No that would be a terrible idea. My assumption is that CCP would approach it in a similar way to how they have made material requirements different before. It'll be different, but not impossible.
---
&gt; It makes you have to invest AT LEAST a recon to cyno in something. 
---
No, it means you need either a force recon or a BLOPs. Even though Combat recons are extremely similar, they are excluded. The restriction is not solely acting as a minimum ante. I can understand not wanting it on things like capitals, HICs, HACs, and T3s. But not on a Huginn? Are Gaurdians just too powerful to allow it? 
---
&gt;  But now you’ve also invested at least a bill worth of subcaps on the field. If fit correctly it’s going to be worth even more than that. 
---
Thats kind of the point I'm making. If you do choose to use a BLOPs it is a significant invesment, but whats the point when recons are doing almost as well, are much cheaper, and can actually warp cloaked (not to mention abilities like tackle, but thats situational)? The 1bil investment isn't necessary and will far from represent the standard level of investment. 
---
&gt; The changes are aimed at making it so cynoing in caps isn’t the immediate and only option people will take. 
---
No, it simply changes the requirements to do that option. I can still cyno in caps to rescue me if I have a recon handy. It hasn't touched on the mechnics at all, which is what I find dissapointing. Instead we got odd and arbitrary restriction on what can do the job.
---
This change could be so much better if they had touched on both. This seems like a pretty low-effort attempt to change the landscape. I'm pleased with the coming of the change, I'm disappointed at the lack of creativity in the method.
---
Well if you can inject into rorq alt, you can inject into a cyno alt.
---
Legion is good, its like Breach league with crazy timeless jewel that change skilltrees based on the seed of the jewel. Also GGG buff so hard for cyclone
---
Did the same thing a couple months ago with 3 RR blops. We thought it was bait for sure and then it died lol.
---
"left it on in fax"

As you can see ladies and gentlemen, the big blue donut sinply does not realise the issue at hand.
---
Right? Thats pretty cool.

ITT Every reply BBTB posts get downvote but somehow the post is gilded. :thinking:

Man, all the salt coming out of big blue donut is amazing despite "we are all gonna be fineee, think of the children".

Aren't those the pointy rock things that hang down from echo chambers?
---
All the salt coming out of big blue donut despite "were all going to be fine, think of the children".
---
Wrong

Well, theres no mechanic in Eve to force people to mine so yeah, they chose
---
You fuckers waited till I fell asleep :(
---
This.  That's why you should have every account attached to a different email.
---
Is this satire?
---
Fighting rats ain't pvp
---
someones salty. lol
---
If you want Concord to come just disable safety and set your drones on the nearest exhumer
---
Sorry doood :(
---
Try 600 :)
---
I think it is. But I think a middle ground can be reached. I would allow command battlecruisers and monitors fit them, at the expense of cloaking capability and a huge signature increase when fitted allowing for easy combat probing of them. Where as your black ops and recons could cloak but the trade off is tankyness.
---
One day people will learn that if your gonna drop to defend then you need to drop the hammer hard and put everything you have in. Dropping a few here and there does nothing but feed.
---
That's because they are frigs and you are fighting them in a battleship.
---
&gt; The MWD is just nice for gating.

I use a faction AB for gating with an orca. It cycles much faster and provides enough propulsion.
---
We promise nullsec won’t gank highsec every minuet for the next 12 months
---
I like chaos because it makes people adapt. If a supply-chain spreadsheet from 2012 is still accurate today, the game is stagnating.
---
Some changes will be great some will suck, but it's literally the only "content" they create for us. Giving us the opportunity to rethink old strategies and adapt to a changing world.
---
&gt;They don't care if they lose short term angry players if the long term health if the game is improved
---
Well that I can get behind at least.
---
You mean to say they've stopped rmting everything they own? I doubt it, now they've got test to hold their hand I'd be shocked if the alliance has any isk at all that isn't on ebay
---
use a normal wormhole, and from there, roll things out.
---
Pretty sure you can't take an ansiblex with an aggression timer.
---
All the rest claiming they want chaos but downvoting every time someone points out how to make the space they didn't conquer or pay to upgrade and keep more chaotic....
---
I can;t imagine a more chaotic game then 100% nullsec. No more centralized trading hubs, no "safe" places for farming money under the umbrella that concord provides. No more safe areas to run low level trig sites.
---
Salvage is supposedly 10m per
---
I'm not saying it was fine the way it was but it's obviously broken on both ends. Doesn't that perhaps suggest that we should be looking for a DIFFERENT solution? Because I'm sorry but this isn't it. It was fucking retarded I get it but so is this. CCP don't know what the hell they're doing. Or maybe that's just it. Maybe they know exactly what they're doing to the game and won't tell us because they know we won't like it.
---
Which are goon feeder corps?
---
The dev blog is so well made. It's really strange to read it and then look at the subs and people yelling at CCP. They do think about things
---
Well if you want high class wormhole stuff move to a high class wormhole.
---
At the rate that some areas are being roamed you'll barely make your money back on your BC before you lose it. Like I said, high sec missions now have a better return rate. This is balanced to some people? All this talk of more risk but the majority of the risk is one sided and none of the rewards are coming with it.
---
Let's talk about that sphere that ships land on. 
---
Yes, it is 5km. Why is that size? Why is not 6km? Why is it different to the 2.5km sphere that you land on when warping to a location? Why is it different to the 15km sphere that you are placed on when taking a gate?
---
These are numbers that CCP arbitrarily chose. They're not permanently etched in stone. CCP is free to re-choose them.
---
You claim that you can't warp a giant blob of supers because of bumping once through a cyno. 
---
I ask you this: why the fuck doesn't CCP make that sphere big enough so supers don't bump? If that happens, do you still *need* do have the cyno on grid? At the very least, your stated reason for it ceases to be valid. 
---
^(PS: It was a rhetorical question.)
---
No those are legitatites. Legitamites protrude from the ground.  Remember it this way, legitamites might reach the top, legitatites hold tight to the ceiling.
---
&gt;echo chambers
---
Fuck. Well played.
---
Great idea. I wonder how many hours it will take until you need something from a trade hub and realize you can't get it because you will get killed.
---
Do you actually sit and watch EVE while mining or do you watch videos or play other games?
---
Because so far, no miners just sit and mine.
---
And yes, so you agree that there WOULD still be plenty of ships without miners.
---
&gt; the only way to move a without costing 300m / jump is to downtime tank the cyno. 
---
I know f1 monkeys are not supposed to be creative, but this is just too much.
---
rip ee
---
The guy is kind of a big deal, plus he said logistics and Materall a bunch. Im a pretty smart fellow and I don’t think I’ve heard anything more legit anywhere ever. Trust this man.
---
I know your comment is hyperbole but id still like to point out that the Venture is only a bit less than 7 years old.
---
Tale of New bro Timmy,  
---
Timmy installs eve, makes character  
---
Does tutorial much like, venture out into space  
---
Heads to anoms, takes damage nothing on overview wut gud?  
---
Very dead, triangle boi much dmg, learn nothing.  
---
uninstall game.  
---
Dont be Timmy.
---
You can organize it by name vs by distance, then you can just go top to bottom. Still not perfect, but better than nothing.
---
It's one thing to say PVP should have no bounds in this game... it's another to say no mercy to newbros, but then you get "remove concord from high-sec"; That is just taking what little protection newbros get and throwing it away.
---
Newbros whaling brings plex into the game for all the people so skilled they do not need to play. How many real players are left supporting this game again? No, not botters, actual players behind the botters, afkers and sometimes solo real players?
---
Dumpster newbros with a vengeance and see what CCPs bottom line is for the game. Dumster newbros and dumster the game.
---
No more newbros staying.. just geezers complaining and then running off to wow classic on the 27th for a while.
---
rorqs on gates, special skills right there , no curing stupidity
---
Pretty much. In the case we need more room, wed probably give qfc the boot. But i don't know what the actual plans are in that situation
---
We have enough people to have 2-3 umbrellas
---
Ingame, of course
---
recruiting btw.
---
Have a safe place with Concord. Hell, even a region. Give them that, all starters. This is not hard.
---
Newbros killed this game. With their shit injector and alt chasing. funding CCP to keep the status quo as long as possible until forced to act
---
Not a troll, I like the change, just feels arbitrarily cumbersome.
---
Nice video. I have one question: I've noticed in your videos that when you fit armor or shield buffer, you tend to go for raw HP. What is your rationale behind not filling your resist hole with one of the rigs?
---
I thought we were your pets?  I'm so confused about this pets thing.  Can you just pet me instead?
---
Holy shit, leave for 30 mins and the high-secers hit the downvote HARD on this post.
---
QFC is a buffer region owned by goons. Goons own and mine all the moons and a few C tier alliances are allowed to stay as the QFC so goons aren't forced to defend the space themselves.
---
either Aeon or wyvern, both are total bricks and in a Scap fight you are too far away for neuts to mean anything
---
I'm pretty sure this guy is former TEST and already left for high-sec when the blackout started. Funny how that happens.
---
scuse?
---
Arguably it’s liberating
---
Oh right nevermind, totally forgot my username. Kek
---
Why didn't the gila just warp off as soon as they saw that they were getting alpha'd? Is it the role of logi to try baiting at this point? Gila had no application issues but couldn't break anything, but could get alpha'd. I'm sure the drone could have eaten any interdictor however so they could warp off.
---
Those are fairly specific capabilities though. In a more general sense, MJD capability exists on other ships (every other subcap if you include the deployable), and bubbles can be emplaced by any ship with a cargo bay.
---
Each capability has tiers with more and more specialty and specific ability. On the flip side, that doesn't mean every ship needs the capability either. 
---
I just feel CCP basically went from 99% to 1% when clearly there is a much more reasonable middle ground. Thinking about it, there might have been more ships that *couldn't* light a cyno before than there are now that will be able to.
---
All the best content creators are all agents of chaos.
---
It's fair.
---
My take on this as a small group player living in Null without an Umbrella is BS. If that were the case the recons in my system for hours watching me fly in a ship that would be a 50/50 outcome would engage if they wanted a fight. Instead they wait until I switch to do PI hauling of something that's a free easy kill. That's the biggest reason I unsubbed 2 accounts. Ill continue to play on my combat main because they don't bother him because its to risky for them.
---
Bam! Truth bomb.
---
Im with you there. I think it wasnt really thought through.
---
But that seems to be CCP's track right now. Just make the change. and then try to balance around it later. 
---
I guess we'll see.
---
Confusing video, you show us a rail merlin, next fight it's a blaster merlin vs rail comet. After that you're more clear! I would separate the video in two parts!
---
Nice fights anyway, makes me want to try the merlin
---
I'm sure a covert battleship will cause no problems at all.
---
For real tho, rework the Blops entirely, make them T3's not T2. Give them Subsystems and T3D Stances and we're golden.
---
Nullbear tantrums, it'll die down.
---
Plenty of t1s and nothing else. And yes plenty of miners sit at there screen while mining. There is plenty to do in eve while mining.
---
Then goonswarm comes to ruin the fun
---
Dude, they don't get it. I think we all should just stop with the logic.
---
These are your options unless you become a Goon.  
---
1) 'Firesale' what you can in-place for liquid ISK, particularly the larger bulky items such as ship hulls/ore/minerals, via market and public contracts.  
---
2) Create a public courier contract(s) for high-value-low-volume stuff you want to keep for the future or sell later, set to deliver in NPC null/lowsec/highsec/Jita depending on your future plans. Some logistics goon may pick up your courier as long as it is on their route?  
---
3) Asset safety the remainder back to lowsec and pick it up/deal with it at your future convenience.
---
You're clueless. How many supers/titans do you own?
---
It's delicious.
---
... that no longer play the game or are 70% of twats in high-sec who never leave.
---
Hilmar
---
I thinks going abit far.  Maybe limit it to destroyers and up.
---
yes
---
HICs should get cynos too
---
In another discussion, another thread we actually came roughly to the same conclusion, having a cyno that could only be fit to caps that works like current cynos etc.
---
If that was the case they would not keep adding stuff like Cyno beacons, etc etc.  After capital ships became more and more popular.
---
open assets, right-click station and asset safety it all to low sec. Have push x or another move it for you later. Join any group take a care pack to get you up and running whilst you wait for your goods to turn up.
---
P.S Hoard is recruiting :D
---
Is it though? What happened to "don't fly what you can't afford to replace?" If 300m is too much to risk then maybe you shouldn't be flying caps.
---
Noone made me a memorial when I lost a 5 billion isk Rorqual. They just said that's what you get for docking at a kick out station
---
Let's keep in mind that this is likely not the final iteration of changes related to cynos and caps. I can only imagine CCP will be monitoring both the forum and in-game responses to the cyno change. Balance is an iterative process and I'm willing to believe that CCP intentionally went for a rather drastic change to see where the dust settles and get a feel for where things should eventually fall.
---
The cyno change is probably good in spirit, though perhaps not necessarily in the details of the execution.
---
I am not talking about regular caps.  they are in a good spot imo.  Im talking about supers.  They definitely need an EHP nerf.  
---
I think that in a battle with supers more should die and t hat a battle having suppers without one dying is not well balanced.
---
You're dealing with people who would probably log 10,000 hours in rail or trucking simulator games.
---
They may use performance indicators that are inherently in-game as opposed to a real life measure.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I think it's safe to say that no matter what they say, people would find a way to interpret and manipulate that data to show that EVE is dying.
---
Smarter just to avoid unleashing that armchair developer behavior onto the world.
---
That's funny. I was the only placing Hilde player left at the end of 5 (except maybe Lord Xavier, I don't remember if he still played). I'm still waiting on her, too. We just got season 2 announced, which they claim was only possible due to overwhelming fan support. We have 4 characters coming with that, and the only confirmed one so far is Haohmaru from Samurai Showdown. The other 3 are confirmed to not be guest characters.
---
&gt; haw titans
---
This still seems like such a weird thing to add to the game.
---
Tracking titans were nerfed back in the day because they sucked hardcore.
---
Open comms was garbage the other night
---
I see the russian wormholers downvote brigade is out in force
---
Bjorn bee seems to all ways get good content when he takes a fleet out by watching his twitch. He has some interesting fleet comps aswell. I know it's not an alliance but he maybe one of the biggest content creator's, come on even GM's are joining his fleet this week
---
Ontario will send you our feral recons to feed you east costers during the late winter months when your unemployment runs out.
---
Fuck Hilmar.
---
The game is dead. Nullsec is timezone tanked bullshit and citadel spam.
---
This has to be bait, right?
---
Yes, **Capacitor**LivesMatter \*clicks on *True Sansha Heavy Capacitor Booster*\***.**
---
So you *really* mean you hate caps and cap warfare. That's all I hear from you in every post.
---
kick SPVG
---
I'm good with that.
---
Excuse me but Lorenzo is the top Squad Leader in Delve!! How dare you. His small fang roams from 1SMEB to ZXB, from 5BTK to 8QT are goon-renown. He is the top content creator.
---
When someone who has been throwing superfleets all over new eden for years says that what you claim for capital engangements to be necessary is bullshit then maybe, just maybe  it might actually be bullshit. Just my 2 cents though.
---
"Pretty sure"...You aren't sure of shit and make it up as you go along. A quick check on my user will give zkill and in-game history. Your opinion is crap too. There is plenty of null for people to go around. There is no need to make everything null, tomorrow an idiot bigger than you will come along and ask to make everything like WH. 
---
Now about me, I found the flair funny and stuck with it. Its been baiting you lot for the 3 years, surprised it still works, especially for likes who appear to be 'pretty sure'. 
---
Been in null since day 1.
---
Lorenzo Maulerent
---
You get downvoted because you're deflecting.
---
These changes are not affecting Goon and Tests ability to keep and upgrade the space they have conquered and are living in.
---
Lighting an instant teleport beacon is a fairly specific capability as well.
---
Dude, null is low stress with way more higher income. Where you been past 4 years. Now all the hoobla hoo you see is turbo krabbers unhappy that null is going to be slightly more stress full but still with all the dank isk.
---
Gotta nerf that dank isk with regionwise resource depletion and multiboxing aspect of rorqs.
---
Want to find a fight? Go out during the week and RF some citadels for the weekend. People will show up, or if they don't, try again. Especially if the moon is semi-valuable for an Athanor, or if it's decently rigged.  
---
    
---
If you're wanting real answers in this thread, I'm sorry to dissapoint you. This sub is divided into two camps right now. People who think the Chaos thing is good and shaking up the game and then the people who are getting shaken up. You're going to get a bunch of snide, shitty comments about how the game is dead or about how content doesn't matter because "LEL CHAOS IS RUINING THE GAME". The reality is we've sat in a period of relative peace and pretty ridiculous lack of elasticity on an alliance/coalition scale now for years, and this major shakeup is causing a lot of grumbling from people who have grown super comfortable, or invested in the status quo. When you have the execs of very generic, purposeless pet alliances coming here to whine consistently about PvE, you know the game is going through some changes.   
---
So, while I hope you get some answers, I don't imagine you will.
---
You're opinion means fuck all.
---
its not and the reasoning they gave it to force recons, quoting ccp rise, is that they already had a cyno bonus in the past (duration and less lo) which is why they choose them. which means they put 0 thought into it
---
Reee-Sub
---
same could be said about you guys wanting small gang pvp, stay in wormholes
---
just imagine the salt when nullsec gets pissed enough to just go steam roll all the wormhole homes
---
Only time will tell.
---
Yup, brain fart, from armchair eve player.
---
As a newbie I remember running terrified from a *freighter*.
---
I did not know what it was.
---
If I was still a newbie and poked a trig with a stick, I would get a very quick lesson in what a trig was, and why poking it was probably not the best idea.
---
People need to learn somehow. Being in a corp *massively* speeds up the learning experience - but players should not be afraid to die just to learn.
---
wormhole brigade came out
---
The battle was epic.
---
I really do find it ironic you keep spewing this shit while having a massive blue list and NIP's with fucking everyone. Turns out the game isn't that boring if you can shoot people in the same timezone as yourself. It's almost like intentionally going to fight the Chinese, and off-timezone from you, was never going to result in anything but shit being timed in their timezone. Weird.
---
The fleet battle is looking exciting.
---
I hope the Damavik will be able to fit covert ops item.
---
Cheer up, your corporation is there for you.
---
I recommend salvaging in 0.0 space. Join a large corporation.
---
I'm a noob and they are a super fun challenge. Almost lost my ship but took two out and fled. Came back and got like 20 mil in loot/salvage. I was hunting for more after that all last night.
---
You're full of shit.
---
&gt;I've even been in several fleets where it seems the FC was in talks with the enemy to get a fight going.
---
There's really no better way to find a fun fight. Either you're ganking someone who can't really offer much resistance, you're being hunted by people who over-ship for you (it's not fun to run away from a T2/faction nano-kite group because your T1 brawlers can't get close enough), or you're talking to your friends, telling them what you have, and asking them if they're interested in bringing something fun to shoot at it.
---
What alliance out there finds the most PvP content?   The one that gathers its risk averse whiners and undocks. For he who seeks - finds.
---
This is a great idea, Bill.
---
Don’t bother making pvp ships for yourself. What you are thinking of doing is akin to trying to make fries by growing potatoes, growing corn, turning the corn into frying oil, growing trees for firewood and then mining ore to smelt your own frying pan. Not efficient. Better to make lots of potatoes, sell them and buy the fries. 
---
You aren’t dead weight, your Indy guy in corp is shit if he isn’t using you properly. Your 9 PI guys could be making something he needs, he could be using you to provide him minerals,  mined and delivered at jita prices.....
---
I've often wondered why third party tools often have better functionality than what's available in-game.
---
I agree and have always advocated for a covert cloak.
---
The covert cloaking delay and terrible resolution means they will rarely catch anything they can beat that can't warp out before they lock.  They're not going to turn into the latest thing in covert tackling or combat with a cov ops cloak.  
---
You're almost always going to have a recon or something else cloaky with them anyway to tackle.
---
&gt;Let's keep in mind that this is likely not the final iteration of changes related to cynos and caps. I can only imagine CCP will be monitoring both the forum and in-game responses to the cyno change. 
---
  
---
You'll need to support that statement by telling me when CCP in the past decade, has released something as significant as this change and had a timely iteration on it.  
---
I'm convinced they are physically incapable of doing it.
---
What part of that pretty obvious logic was problematic for you?
---
I lived in null for 2 years and did not enjoy it.
---
Trying to unravel your bullshit and explain it to you just isn't worth it. I'll pass.
---
TEST 2019: too hard to argue, so just gonna go through your Reddit profile and downvote everything you've said for 2 weeks instead and then try to pretend I'm somehow smarter without actually refuting anything.
---
I'm getting downvoted because the highsec and lowsec "l33t pvpers" don't want to have to deal with bubbles, DD's and bombs in their home space.
---
According to CCP's released stats most new bros aren't staying as it is.
---
Just another Reddit troll with a hard on for TEST. You're literally not worth the effort.
---
Is there any way to get a feel for what the different NullBlocs are actually like so that I can weigh whether or not I want to join them besides putting alts into their "we take anyone" corps like KarmaFleet, Horde, Brave Newbies? Because I'm pretty sure that nearly everything on Reddit about them is propaganda with a tenuous relationship with truth.
---
Nah
---
Isn't that the whole point of this "Chaos era" thing? My understanding of it was that CCP may finally be more inclined to experiment with the game with rapid and drastic changes. Besides, we already know that more substantial changes to capitals are in the works, and those changes would have to live in the context of whatever CCP's vision for cynos is. Your skepticism is well-founded, but I think there is a minute hope that this particular change may see some refinement.
---
A hardon for TEST? I'm friends with Sapporo and many other people still in TEST. I was in TEST for over 4 years and didn't bitter-ex about it after leaving. I don't have a problem with TEST other than they have a bunch of useless hangerons that have somehow equated TEST's success to their own. I have a problem with morons like you who try to fend off your dumb fucking posting and inane thought processes with "He disagrees with me, he must be a troll!"
---
I have a problem with YOU spouting bullshit about 'blue and NIPS to fucking everyone' when we're here fighting FRT, PL, NC, Horde ... Get fucked.
---
Nope, because they tank too much compared to force recons and BO. One more window for cap hunting is fine trade off.
---
Nullsec was too safe. End of story. In high sec you have to play smart. Make instant undocks/docks or a ganker will blap your ass. A guy I know got ganked in his hauler in uedama two days ago. He lost 2 bil. If he woulda used a webbing alt, he woulda been fine. If you carry an Orca through highsec with no webber , its 50/50 chance you will get blapped based on your fitting and whether a bumping mach sees you. CODE and PIRAT are very active. Almost like being in a war constantly. You nullseccers, you really are the babies of new eden. Ive been nuked to zero multiple times in high/low. PS: Printing ISK from afk carrier ratting is not a "play style" LMAO
---
You're hilarious.
---
Thanks.
---
I'd really like some people to do a fight where it's no real FC commands regarding focusing fire or anything.
---
Just swarm and shoot and try to figure out if people are shooting at the same target as you.
---
Would be more like movie space battles.
---
Right, so you're a man-child that has an issue wrapping your head around how numbers work, then? Because the EU/US entities you just referred to are a tiny percentage of the people you're NIP'd against in those same timezones. Meaning you're going to have less content. Aren't you an FC or some shit? How can you be this dumb? Not only that but you make it sound like you're a victim somehow? You guys persecuted that war, if I recall correctly, while simultaneously blue'ing more people (FI.RE). It's not really shocking that if you can't attack structures nearby in your timezone you're not gonna get any content. But I guess keep falling back on bitching about timezone tanking (in a war you persecuted lmao) and Citadel spam (because you can't shoot them with NIP's)
---
i never got plex
---
We have plenty of content. https://zkillboard.com/alliance/498125261/topalltime/ &lt;&lt; take a look, and while you're at it, here's some numbers. How far down that list is your so-called corp that was here twice as long as SPVG? What did you do, mine all fucking day?
---
Some nullsec alliances have figured out how to roll wormholes away with disposable alpha alts, maybe try that.
---
Exploration, DED fishing, L4 blitzing, incursions
---
no, i installed it through a link in a youtube VID in the Eve online channel (the one in which they make the statement that the eve online is free to play)
---
I have checked the task bar and the it has a Eve online 32 bit client thing show up whenever i try to open/run the launcher it goes away after a few seconds
---
what is reboot? ( i uninstalled the launcher nad reinstalled it, still had the same problem )
---
And that's the whole blob vOv
---
If you have plenty of content, why are you bitching about timezones and Citadels you can't shoot? Did you just unironically Kbstats me? My Corp is 47 on that list. It was also 25% the size of SPVG. Are we equating the worth of a corporation to Kbstats now? Seems like a pretty un-TEST thing to do, on top of functionally retarded. I'm not going to have a pissing contest about corp relevance, but I'll finish off with you've refuted literally nothing I've said other than some weird, ham-fisted attempt to discredit a corp that's been inactive for a year.
---
its software not a switch for a light bulb how can i turn it of and back on?
---
I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling (Only once i'll try once more)
---
lul
---
what? I have never heard FCs talking with enemy FCs? where is this that this was happening lmao
---
Shitposters probably shitpost while at work
---
I have but i'll try that again
---
They're not here to ruin the fun. They're just here to ruin your fun.
---
so I'm supposed to spend my time playing wackamole with higgs rigged battleships on rage rolled wormholes?
---
There's also the Yan Jung, who may or may not be the ancestors of the Jin Mei.
---
what?
---
We know so little of the Yan Jung it is kind of ridiculous.
---
IIRC they are mentioned only once in any Eve fiction text. And even that is basically an offhand mention about some archeological finding (a part of a hyperdrive from a massive ship).
---
When Eve released "Into the Abyss" it turned out their way of indicating the upcoming buyout by Pearl Abyss. Now with all these "Age of Chaos" posts I can't help but to suspect another buy out by some company that has "Chaos" in its name.
---
I wouldn't have made it as restrictive. It probably does need reworks to prevent capital ships from being the solution to everything, but this seems like overkill.
---
Honor brawls happen in WHs fairly often
---
And now you have no valid opinion on this topic since you have zero clue how they work.
---
So the small, casual player and hia totally casual friends will suffer from not being able to drop htheir 10 titans on everything that moves?
---
Even in chaos Era we have no iterative design changes. The local blackout is said to be temporary and we haven't heard anything about that yet. CCP forgetting to iterate is still the theme until proving otherwise.
---
may i ask what they did in the new patch?
---
You must be flair baiting.
---
Shangri La
---
Nothing would die if there were logi
---
Only if you want to respond to them.
---
With the announced cyno changes will cyno beacon use change any?
---
I got on public channels with a few hauling corps to ask about how they jump around, and they told me they hardly ever jump to any cyno but their own alt.
---
Have you ever seen average nullsec linemembers try to fc? I've literally fragged out 10v60 because their fc was clueless.
---
usually if there's a super battle going on usually more than 1 does die.. and let's just say one doesn't die that doesn't translate to them being op. I'm just going to guess you have minimal to no capital experience and that's why you're making these odd suggestions.
---
Recently in 46DP legecy dropped supers and caps into a battle and then proceeded lose control of the subcap battle and then lost a nyx to group of subcaps.
---
How did that happen if supers and caps apparently win everything and subcaps are useless?
---
Can't wait to watch this video, what's good Carlos
---
no you're not, you're a whiny bitch
---
can confirm capf is, indeed, the best f
---
CODE. There is a crazy amount of miners in highsec without permits. You can literally destroy a mining ship every 15 minutes for twenty-three hours straight.
---
and you're a cunt, what's your point?
---
While true, CCP has proven hilariously incapable of any semblance of balance or making well thought out changes in a timespan less than years.  With this horrifically horrible dev method, this breaks the game when literally anyone can insta-train into the OP shit that CCReee refuses to properly fix.  Since they sure aren't getting any better, Injectors will always break the game no matter what other random changes they do.
---
They mentioned chain booshing and bombers as being overpowered, so they’re ahead of you on that one.
---
I mean test had a hand in killing it.
---
&gt; and let's just say one doesn't die that doesn't translate to them being op. 
---
I disagree entirely.
---
&gt; I'm just going to guess you have minimal to no capital experience and that's why you're making these odd suggestions. 
---
You're incorrect, I do have alot of capital experience, I just think differently than most other people.
---
"Doing things"?  They're just doing the normal CCP style of shit bandaids on top of bandaids without any concept of how it'll actually affect the game.  They don't touch the real problems because it's either too hard or will hurt their cash shop.   
---
They're fine with losing players in the short term, yet they're not doing anything that will improve their 1% retention rate; seems to be more classic CCP non-thinking.  As per usual, I predict a CCP :SurprisedPikachu: in 6 months, wondering where all the players have gone.
---
Low effort changes ARE shitty changes, because they're just bandaids.  You can't make a bunch of high impact, low effort changes in a game as complex as EVE without breaking tons of other shit.  And that's all CCP has done for years.
---
To all of the guys in Shoot First thank you for helping out Bounty Contracting Ltd. it was fun o7
---
It sounds like Seagull never got to actually do much of anything, with Hilmar being a retard and half of the devs fighting her on everything, so I don't think she can take any blame.  There's a reason she left (and no, its not "normal turnover" when half of your high level devs leave in a short time)
---
Look at a fight like X47. Now pretend the Imperium titans are being constantly bubbled and are unable to do anything, and that by the time they do get off grid (leaving a few dc’d pilots behind to die) they warp into drag bubbles 400km off the keepstar, and sit around doing nothing until it repairs. 
---
Is that balanced at all? Caps need a way to move despite bubbles and Tidi in order for battles to happen. I guess this prevents serenity from happening here, but doing that by making every coalition with a decent superfleet impossible to attack is not a good mechanic
---
Wrong.  Cost and skills are CERTAINLY balancing factors.  They just can't be the ONLY balancing factor.
---
Another thread, another Valkorsia meltdown :joy:
---
It would work if the excavator-fighters didn't have autorepeat.  So you literally have to press F1 every cycle.  Would be 10x better at fixing the problem than half of these other shit changes CCP has done, and is low-effort too.
---
Then they're FRIGHTENINGLY absolutely fucking retarded, because literally everyone saw how Injectors were going to work out, and told them repeatedly.  But MUH WHALE CASH is more important.
---
They can’t recruitment scam. I’m pretty sure they can do other scams, though
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with a super umbrella.
---
Just one time I would like to see a picture of a lonely miner in a belt, protected by 500 titans floating nearby.
---
/for the wonderful picture that could make.
---
fuck what a night  dude
---
the cyno change affects LS nearly the most, i guessed. Since logistics cyno via stations now has to go with expensive cynos (though 1 min is pretty safe)
---
No.  You do not deserve the gold and platinum on this post.
---
... and ECM changes was a content for ECM pilots which they should be grateful for.
---
&gt;On June 24th 
---
&gt;He was given a semi-director role. 
---
Haha. Good job getting revenge though :)
---
Exploration is now changed to feeding the people camping the relic site in a Sebo’s bomber and a couple t3cs. 
---
Incursions now only spawn one at a time and have a fairly long gap between spawns, so there is a lot more competition for sites (so less isk for everyone, but especially alpha friendly groups). 
---
Invasion loot prices are dropping fast due to overproduction so they aren’t great anymore and are getting worse. 
---
Abyssals had a stealth nerf to loot and they are also being overfarmed so the isk/ hr has gone down quite a bit. 
---
TL;DR, come to wormholes, CCP is fucking up the rest of the game but for now they’ve apparently forgotten that wormholes exist, so there’s plenty of isk here as long as you have a hole with a c3 static.
---
Nah, remove all subcaps.
---
I too, can have stupid ideas.
---
Obviously a large group of sub caps can kill a super. The problem the game is facing has absolutely nothing to do with large f1 pushing battles. That is almost exclusively the only play style CCP has put effort into developing the last 5 years, to the detriment of other play styles.
---
I'm sorry I guess I should have clarified in my post that it has nothing to do with huge tidi fights. I am talking about spontaneous interactions between small groups of pilots. These are the kind of interactions the game needs to foster so that it stays interesting. One of the biggest barriers to those interactions is caps which are practically invincible to a small force and can teleport to provide instant backup. In these cases the subcaps are irrelevant because they can't kill the caps or anything the caps are repping.
---
Like when then go after SF and complain that all the timers for an AU TZ alliance are in AU TZ, this game is just so unfair omg!
---
As always mate big o7 to you buddy
---
Testing?  LOL, this is CCP.  Throwing shit at the wall in a live environment is their version of testing.
---
Thanks for the endorsement, fam. A lot of people will say that trust is a valuable commodity but it's who trusts you that counts the most and I think we can all agree that I know Materall.
---
Like I said, stupid was on us. 
---
Also to clarify, he didnt get that role day 1. It was about day 50ish
---
Just because ccp does something does not mean it is good for game balance.
---
That's a little harsh.
---

---
&gt;In our corp, we provide the doctrine ships for fleets, you go out, pew, then return them. its our way of lessening the burden on members so they can then spend their money on ships they want for non-srp'd fleets.
---
I've been playing for less than a year and I could have told you what would happen.
---
Honestly it’s kind of all the same (and I say this as a goon). I think goon probably has the most diverse set of things to do, because of the size of the group and their crazy SRP, but you can have fun in all of them. I know a few people in brave, and they’re always cool, and I’ve heard PL can be kinda disorganized in voice coms, but anyone I’ve talked to across the blocs are quite cool.
---
Means enough to extract salt from you, heh.
---
In Dunk we trust
---
Brave is recruiting btw 7o
---
No, I do enjoy cap warfare, but imo it's too unbalanced and favourable to caps under current mechanics.
---
Probably Black Friday.
---
Very under watched guy. I like his videos
---
I never said you should rat in caps. I said that if you want to rat with caps it would make sense to be able to maintain some protection. Since herbivores' protection since time immemorial has been herding up it makes complete sense that this is the way to go about it (at the expense of lowered ticks or human interaction or whatever other things scare you people to death).   
---
Otherwise ratting with subs is perfectly legit, and caps should be used for pvp which is pretty legit imo :)
---
Didnt your head FC said you guys use ceptors these days?
---
The nerf to normal cyno's has indirectly buffed covert cyno's its a small buff to Black Opps already :\], they do still need some love becuase of that crazy price tag but I don't think cloak is it, I'd rather see a heavy e-war bonus that is able to bypass Capital E-war resistances, imagine a redeemer actually having effect tracking disrupting a dread.
---
Great video, good fights. People have this mistaken idea that a single BS poses no threat and can't apply its damage too well, they always find out the hard way that if you do it right you can nuke them HARD!
---
I myself took out this char doing solo BS PVP this weekend for the first time, had one good fight and one where I got dunked on :P
---
These sort of stories are what make this sort of game so amazing and unique
---
 
---
In retrospect, did you miss any red flags?
---
So, I don’t have a skill farm, but it’s kinda profitable. Sometimes. Generally, you break even but there are some months where they line up so you get an extra extractor. Those are like the super profitable months.
---
No only 2 logo each side for every 20 other ships
---
Excuse my stupidity. Me is goon. But for fleets I see the same thing happening. It takes just too much time to land. Any competent fc that notices a cyno ship is gonna switch instantly if in range. 
---
The real issue I see with this change is actually this. You won’t be able to escalate fights. Yeah krabbing and super umbrellas and blah blah, but there are ways to still be safe under that environment. 
---
The excitement of an escalation is what makes some fights like super cool and creates content that might have just been a stomp on one side.
---
No competent FC is going to jump in small amount of caps for each cyno over and over again. That's similar to a big fleet warping into a bubble 20 ships at a time, those twenty ships will be dead before the next group even lands. 
---
Plus if only a part if the fleet makes it through, they are likely outnumbered and will all die. And that's not even talking about reinforcements/reshipping
---
Allow installing more than one clone bay on a structure, that needs to be fueled. Maybe make it require a rig as well (like links rig allows putting up multiple links). It should not be as cheap as just fueling 2 clone bays. Price of second raitaru would probably not be a problem, but qol would be greatly improved.
---
Thanks for the reply :)
---
Pando on His Stuka fleets no pre agreement just pew
---
a few. too eager to please. 
---
he invited me too often and too pushy to drop my super with him (never took him up on it), which probably would have ended in an AWOX.  
---
once he was given roles he was really pushy that he be given access to the wallet (thankfully he wasn't)
---
many corps do that, our just makes sure its only directors that can hand them out instead of cookie jar man. we just gave the wrong dude the key to said cookie jar is all.
---
Do you farm the SP on one character per account? With like +5 implants always?
---
Or is it 3 characters all on one account all with +5 implants with 2mcts etc..
---
If it's barely profitable that way, it's gonna be hard. Not many of my characters never die. They are either at risk earning isk or transporting goods, risking their pods sometimes.
---
Time + specialization.
---
Last time pre-blackout I flew through Horde space, its was empty anyways. Not sure why you guys complain about Blackout, you never had anyone in local in the first place!
---
You always do 3 characters on one account. And yes with +5s. It’s not really something you do on an account you actively play, for that reason. A lost set of implants is like a couple months in profit. 
---
Although you can do PI on them too as it’s relatively safe. Just jump clone, do a pi run, then jump back into implants.
---
I’m right there with you friend, have both skills at 5 and I still have to destroy an ungodly amount of implants (mostly warfare links)
---
there's nothing inherently wrong w that, but for obvious reasons it usually only works in rich tight-knight groups
---
CCP Rises\* :P
---
You'd likely be looking at killing Clone Soldiers in lowsec. That should be enough information to go looking for more info on how that actually works.
---
I certainly understand the desire to get a jump on things. Especially the 'behind the scenes' skills like engineering navigational skills. If there were a cap on using them for hull skills, particularly capitals, I'd be pretty happy. Sadly I dont think well see CCP putting the lid on the that cash box.
---
A quick google search yields the NPC "Sister Alitura" in the station at Arnon IX, Moon 3.
---
You should get in the habit of googling things that you come across, there's a wealth of information on the game and it might lead you to a new path to explore. Though be aware that this game has been out for a long time and some information may be outdated. Stuff related to this arc hasn't been changed for a long time though so you should be fine here.
---
Who fucking cares if they lose them or not
---
Ganking and escalating shouldn’t be safe and it should be fun win or lose even if the killboard takes a hit to bleed your enemies
---
Thank you for the video! I'm trying to relearn PvP, not sure where to start tho. 
---
Would you recommend cruisers? Battlecruiser? Battleship? 
---
I'm not sure which one would give me most opportunity to learn, I think I don't have enough sp for battleship
---
tl;dr
---
lots of salt
---
If wormholes are safe, and the main keystone there being a lack of local, why is the blackout such an issue?
---
Depends what your idea of content is.  Many nowadays see content as hyperdunking easy pve kills or catching solo ships in your roaming gang.
---
Content doesn’t have to mean fighting with you being advantaged only, contrary to the whining that is.
---
Win or lose balls dee style FCs are seen as nooby and rare nowadays.... But the best unbiased answer I can give (until bombers get nerfed to balance blackout) is Bombers Bar.
---
No this is a bad idea, the only thing that could make sense is a sub structure that you build onto a wormhole that extends its life by maybe double, giving anyone the ability to come and attack that sub structure  (with no reinforcement timer) in order to close the whole.
---
“i’ve never used the modules causing this change but here’s my opinion”
---
Come on man
---
Delete all subcaps,  then they can’t lose to caps and be sad about it
---
&gt; Fweddit flair
---
You guys seem pretty cool. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that you had an arrangement like that. But my thoughts are that if it's a group large enough to fuel a Keepstar to put a Titan in, it's probably not going to be like that.
---
I mean, 96% of reddit is that tho
---
I made that statistic up but i would NOTbe surprised if it was close to that
---
Yeah but if it's barely profitable, I don't see a reason to do it as a newish player. It takes time to train chars up to 5M SP, then you lose 500K SP to reach the threshold, then you need to invest in implants..
---
This is only good if you were there when SP farming was profitable and already had almost ready accounts for it.
---
I'm trying to extract the skills I don't need or the skillpoint I don't need, but yeah can't do much about the characters that are too far off
---
On the other hand, they are probably also the only ones that have metrics on things like total number of individual players rather than alts, which is a rather important metric for long term health of the game.
---
'Our CEO was a nervous paranoid fuck'
---
Lmao
---
CCP. Only corporation that does nothing with their lore.
---
Other than with few hardcore lore players and not through any official communication channel
---
i fundamentally think there's nothing wrong with throwaway cyno ships (atrons, ceptors, bombers) but the problem arises mainly with super tanky ships like supers/rorquals being able to light a cyno themselves (also in addition  to inhibs not shutting down already existing cynos) is a big issue so i only agree with 2 &amp; 3
---
Those lokis, not controlling range at all, getting sligshotted by grappler bs. 🤔🤔🤔
---
Anyways gj man, very nice fites.
---
1) Won't happen, would REALLY hurt the people this change is supposed to benefit, i.e "huntersss" while not affecting pve  
---
2) Interesting idea, but still is a defensive boon for ships that never leave one system anyways (pve)  
---
3)Brick tank cynobaddon here we come... also my response in 1.  
---
4) You said it, it hurts hunters. Hunters are the loudest and most unhappy if ANYTHING doesnt give them a bleeding edge without them needing to change strategies.... so won't happen. Also defender buff again  
---
5)This is a good idea. Many, many, many have suggested a drawback to cloaks similar to this. But... CCP is doing this by making it increased to fitting by ship hull instead of something every titan could just... have 
---
I hear you on the pains of being a small tier player trying to own and use a cap, but CCP \*really\* doesnt care about that playstyle since PL quit roaming in them.  nobody else does, so it's seen as "big spooky null bear gets too safe" which is Hilmar's boner he is hoping will be hard enough to get a bonus from Pearl Abyss with this fall
---
Nice to see justice. Though it's jarring to see a familiar name, how's it going tevo? Thought you were in that wh Corp.
---
i mean yeah, but 10 is such a nice round number
---
The arise of "hard tackle cyno" ships is a pretty big contributor to how powerful the umbrella is, yeah. If it's a throwaway rookie ship or something I don't see a lot of problem with it either.
---
Could you post fit? I'm curious
---
... yeah. We're still kinda glum and still "fuck that guy". But we got a titan kill, and some revenge, so less salty than could be?
---
yeah i do agree, you see this especially in lowsec with cyno devoters/prots/enforcers/arazus etc. always thought they shouldnt be able to tackle themselves or receive reps since they're very fkn hard to kill
---
Still own the hole, but J-space is full of "russian rape trains" so we split our time now and merged into Bounty Contracting in Shoot First. 
---
Going well... ok I guess not after a large theft, but better now. You?
---
So far thank you guys! I was hoping for constructive discussion and you gave it. Some great ideas in there too.
---
&gt; it seems like they have changed from "let's ruminate on this for a long time first" to "let's ~~iterate as much and~~ *hit our PCU count with a hammer* as fast as possible"
---
ftfy
---
I thought the titan loss would be greater than what he stole....how much did he actually pocket?
---
I just wish I could have the money to play the game full-time
---
I'd make cynics like polarized weapons: fit cyno = zero resists.
---
I'm listing them individually for the sake of addressing each one, but if I were to do this myself I would combine 2 and 4. There's not enough ehp to survive until the cavalry arrives in a subcapital ratting ship these days, so I think that would be enough to address it. If not maybe mix in some aspects of 1. Maybe give it to rorquals with the option of either lighting a cyno or hitting PANIC, but not both at the same time.
---
I also think that this new CCP might ignore the "BAAAWWW" from seal-clubbers complaining this bout around. We're seeing a more pre-2012 style CCP than we have in a long time, except instead of just drastic changes it feels more directed.
---
That's the best comment in this thread.
---
I might be misremembering, but I think they used to disable remote assistance. If they didn't I think that would be a welcome change too.
---
That's certainly a good risk added to it, but that would kill HIC cyno's. Which are a pretty key component in capital fleet fights, and would wind up having similar problems to what I think these changes have.
---
No bullshit, no shame? 200B
---
Fitted doctrine ships. Extra modules. Cap parts, fuel. Several fit Zarmazads and Leshaks. Some faction Battleships, faction and dead space mods.
---
I think most of them just got baited into starting too early/feeling too safe.
---
I'm pretty bad at execution so I over-invest in set up and execution.
---
Also luck. Lots of times this didn't work :)
---
yuk.....But it is good you at least got his ass.
---
I'd personally recommend battlecruisers, then cruisers, because they share the same weapons systems.
---
BCs are amazing performance vs isk.
---
Battleship PVP is frequently super frustrating and requires a lot of set up.
---
😂😂
---
Well, not anymore post-blackout according to all his whining comments 😂
---
Wait, you mean no one at CCP is looking into the 9000 changes you have to make to the UI/settings before you play? 
---
It seems safe to add new npcs to overview tabs and let players hide and save after an update if they dont want the new entities showing? 
---
Why isnt Show Readout disabled?
---
Why are all of the useful icons on the toolbar now hidden under an E?
---
Why is the basic overview so trash?
---
The absolute state of wormholers in this post.
---
Era of chaos is good lol fuck null sec make null sec dangerous... hang on what do you mean you want reliable access to wormholes so you can pvp? No that will make wormholes too dangerous! Please don't make it easier to kill us whilst we krab in our usual safety!
---
Ive never seen as many people quit since the last MAJOR changes years ago.  They can lie all they want about the numbers being what they want... but the long term effects are going to be evident soon.
---
This is a short term shake for Hilmar to build his case this fall.  Nothing more.  I'll be downvoted to fucking hell for saying it, but that's the truth.
---
The main keystone is them being able to roll their gates shut than intel in regards to safety that and you cant light a cyno on them.
---
Titans are more common than tackle frigates it seems. The pyramid is quite broken
---
That was our thought. At first we wanted to ransom our shit back, but we just went with the kill button. Doubted he'd give up 10x the worth for his titan
---
Oh 1 nyx? Wow. Very wow.
---
gila does work fine, lost a drone to a group of 8 yesterday (5 to start, 3 more warped in during the fight) but ship was never below 50% shield.
---
I've literally never once in my entire almost 8 years of playing seen Nullsec this active in terms of fighting. The only times it has ever been this active before were during massive wars around the Moneybadger and Casino War periods.
---
I don't think this is the right way to fix cynos, but I do think the game is currently in a better place than it has ever been before.
---
&gt;where it's no real FC commands regarding focusing fire or anything.
---
Go fly with a nano gang man. Decisions made by group consensus.
---
What exactly were you doing before? I saw someone else cheer on these because they saw an AFK orca die, but... said orca would cost 700+M and earn 7M/hr, that's pretty poor income (even bots won't do that lol).
---
gila makes quick work of them if you're a fan of drone boats, may be worth using faction drones over t2 for the extra life.
---
Alternately, a one-shot cyno of some sort...  Behaves like a regular cyno, or perhaps a mini cyno beacon that deploys more like a mobile depot, but it only allows a single ship to jump to it before collapsing.
---
f
---
My Orca almost died to a bunch of them since I needed to focus on the kids (you know, priorities). My orca was just idling in a belt. 70% hull when I came back and the acolyte II that was out had killed 4 of them. I love it. I'm not safe idling anymore and I should never have been. Fun level just went up a notch when risk was added.
---
Your fleets are always great!
---
high sec carebears can't even PVE
---
Star Citizen did it, Star Citizen did it!
---
Because umbrellas are where most of the people are...
---
&gt;being able to roll their gates shut
---
You cant do that because someone else can always roll into you.
---
Add to your list:
---
\- Make cyno have a max mass limit (T1 should only be enough for one capital to jump thru) and add a T2 Cyno with way higher cpu/PG need which has enough mass limit to jump a few capitals thru 
---
\- fuel consumption based on the mass that gets thru (high enough so you can´t use a throw away corvette or frigs/destroyers for cynos and don´t allow them on industrials)
---
\- a one time use module like Capital Emergency Hull Energizer
---
\- increase the production costs of cyno
---
That's pretty common between non blue but friendly and 300 treaty alliances that their junior fc's arragne "fights".
---
But if you think that the game needs to be rebalanced, why are you railing against smallgang dudes that have advocated for the same shit the last 2 years? That doesn't make sense.
---
&gt;to just go steam roll all the wormhole homes
---
Goodness you're cute if you're this stupid. 
---
Evictions are the most denegerate and unfun activities every designed by Bob. The only reason HK was evicted because it was quite a bit of cash because of asset safety.
---
Overview settings are backwards. The tick should be for removing an item from overview (change it to a X in the UI), that way whenever they add new shit it would be on your overviews by default. If the player then removes it and dies there is no one they can whine to.
---
This is awesome - really cool to see you making all your money back too.
---
I'd have thought you'd be able to piece together that keeping a wormhole critted so buddy dropping in collapses it = pretty much rolling your  "gates" shut
---
1. / 2. Drawbacks like agility and warp speed don't mean anything for Rorquals and as long as you can refit with a Nestor or a Mobile Depot, 2. will be easy to get a around.  
---
3. Cyno Damnations, no thx  
---
4. This would also not change anything for Rorquals
---
5. Fitting requirements are not really an issue for capitals
---
But that would imply that someone would fight someone else instead of perma crabbing and blueing.
---
Tales from the wild west.
---
I'm in E-Uni. Probably more High-Sec Orcas than any other corp if you include non-corp alts (because even though P I R A T probably knows who those Orcas belong to, CONCORD would have a word with them if they attempted to engage). So far as I know, the biggest mining ship that any of us lost to the Recon Damaviks was an Exhumer.
---
If you're getting that little from an Orca, you're doing something wrong. I know people who pull in over a billion ISK per week from Orca alts. Helps that we have a few systems (Hoona, Jufvitte, Brellystier come to mind immediately). 
---
Sure, for most people, it's not going to be that much higher, but if you have enough Athanors available, you're usually going to be able to find a moon with Arkonor or Gneiss. Just park your ship on the biggest rock that your survey scanner finds. Some people even have remote access software on tablets to reposition the Orca while at work.
---
I don't mind more NPC activity so long as there's a reason for it from player perspective.
---
Diamond rats are a perfect example; they have frigates casually dealing pvp cruiser+ levels of damage and drop nothing. Clear out their actual base (takes 15-30 mins, i did with three toons and took 30) you get 30m spread out over your fleet... and the base dropped a 5m module.
---
Highsec has always been "safe*". Ganking has been happening forever and CONCORD doesn't stop it, invasions have been providing threat (albeit with a clear warning, so it's opt-in) and now NPC's will spawn with no warning. If the risk is getting increased in such ways, i think players do deserve something more than a "okay, you did it" for dealing with it as well as the things they affect (HS mining is laughable, but apparently also the primary target for these? :P)
---
Well the whole point of flying nano is to avoid getting blobbed. And if you insist on brawling knowing the region/residents will also help with the number of times.  
---
Blobbing isn't completely avoidable, but nothing should be. That is how good game balance works, when you rock-paper-scissor style counters.
---
Stage three of grief: Bargaining
---
Well If you are stupid enough to drop a dread in the ansiblex. Everything else wont bei shot by the dd. Also the dd can kill friendlies. Dont make sich a fuzz about uhhh but dOmSdaYs...
---
I can't remember if rat bounties are split between all players on grid or between fleet members only. Anyone knows ?
---
Found BombTymer's reddit account!
---
you are wrong, but welcome to try again =)
---
Put cynos back onto combat ceptors. They aren't nulli, or tanky, but they can move places quickly which is ideal.
---
If you leave cynos onto slow warping recons there will be a lot less opportunities for subcap fights.
---
Solo PvP, scram kite tormentor vs fed Navy comet. Having real trouble against these. Can stay out of blaster range but the drones, the drones. What sort of tactics should I be trying?
---
How about the smallest thing that can fit a cyno is a battlecruiser and CCP put actually some work instead of doing dumb 0/1 database changes.
---
Because the idea that problems created by huge superships, can be fixed by BIGGER MORE-SUPER ships, is just so absurd it might work!
---
be quick, be4 ccp removes asset safty thou :P
---
Bro how do you find content if u cant convo their fc from local?
---
to be fair, "don't fly what you can't afford" is a bit difficult as a statement for a ship whose sole purpose is being locked down for 5 minutes unable to move, dock or tether just to enable another account to move a ship.
---
You're not achieving anything or able to fight in that situation; it's just a net cost/upkeep.
---
See now you’re getting it
---
Impossible he is the best content creator (within Delve)
---
Entitled about what? I dont feel entitled about anything, except as a paying customer get straight answers and not bs answers because TiS doesnt want to hurt CCP feelings......
---
&gt;so buddy dropping in collapses it = pretty much rolling your "gates" shut
---
This is your brain on spod. 
---
You realize you're able to use more than capital ships right? We've killed tons of shit using enyos, deacons, and skilled booshers. 
---
It's actually disgustingly easy because they think they're safe and nobody puts a hic or two through after it crits.
---
All other kills are done with carriers, now it's done with sins. Took him two days!
---
I personally think battleships as a whole could probably have done with this role; they have some defenses and are far from the meta, they're also not insignificant in price and a pain in logistics if you're trying to set up a few dozen of them (50k m³ when packaged).
---
I mean it felt quite active in tenerifis last night
---
Where do I send my formal Application for Officer Role in Shoot First.?
---
Frat are not timezone tanking you, they just live in another timezone. Currently TEST has a NAP NIP whatever with every other primarily USTZ group in the game, hardly surprising that the primarily Chinese coalition you're fighting sits strongly outside your TZ.
---

You don't understand wormhole ratting or wormhole space in general

He in fact gave no opinion on that change. At least read the post if you are going to tldr it in the comments man.
---
Tin Foil: CCP and Cloud Imperium are working together and Star Citizen is really EVE 2 and will take that name when fully released.
---
The “Vulture” is the clue! 
---
You’ll log into eve one day and wake up in the living quarters bed.

My personal inbox with proof that you're a super pilot and 10B isk please. I'll file it right away with the added Express fee of 5B isk. Thank you for your interest!!!
---
*in the inevitable event that you are declined for the role, any isk you paid for application fees and express fees are not refundable*
---
Wasn’t this already posted? Or am I missing something..
---
Interesting; the infrastructure is what matter i guess, considering it requires, as you say, "enough athanors".
---
Mining regular veldspar and plagioclase, the income is literally 7m/hour. And those people earning that appear to be the main target of these new NPC's, which does seem kind of sad to me that such low income is getting nerfed more. Not like a moon belt full of orca's is going to be falling prey to the damaviks. :P
---
you just don't get it, but that's ok you don't have to understand your're wrong to be wrong.
---
Will you double that 10b if I get accepeted? :D
---
Kiki will best jaguar but it doesn't matter because the blob will be on you before you get him. No real solo counter for fleet ramjag.
---
damn he's so good he already adapted to a patch two weeks before it came out
---
Playing EVE? YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT IN AUTZ.
---
And give you a free Hel from our corporate officers hanger!
---
Oh no I'm a reposter? I read this sub quite often, I'm disappointed.
---
Taking a long break. Liquidated quite a bit of shit and plexed main for 10 months. Got a loki im living out of for now whenever I login once in a while.
---
He cant use carriers because thats in a DED site. He did plenty of kills with blops before.
---
Ok...
---
Sounds nice. My personal play style for the past few months is only 1 ship at a time. Ots nice to be simple :)
---
you don't need an expensive T3C to get solo dunks in null
---
I don't recall the exact wording of the legislation, but drugs can't be depicted without negative side effects. Since drugs in Eve have a chance of negative side effects, little grey area
---
And HS statics to all tradehubs?
---
Im not gonna say youre wrong because youre not when it comes to stagnation for small gangs. But general stagnation is connected to bloc warfare. And they are also what CCP uses for marketing.
---
The thing here is, somehow we in NS are forced to entertain small gang. I dont really get that idea to be honest. I mean your lack of content comes from the fact that CCP hasnt created something for you. 
---
Yes, I get that. But NS cant be expected to do everything. We get a lot of shit from all over, especially lately. But if you think about it, we stand for CCPs marketing, we are what gets new players to try the game out and we are also what keeps new players in. And also old ones as well, I mean most actually enjoy being part of whatever they are a part of. We also have to entertain small gangs and now in a more tedious manner than before whilst being expected to fight offensively in a more tedious manner as well so our fights can be promoted.
---
Without any real incentive, against a million timers.
---
You can like it or not but this is the reality of things. And whenever you nerf something big enough for us it will have a reaction. The blackout nerfed our means of retaining new players and the cyno change is gonna make it harder for us defensively (to a point) but also offensively (to a point). This will make leaders think twice and since there is no reason for war atm...
---
So if small gangs want buffs for them and nerfs for us, are you willing to do your part? Are you willing to start actively recruiting newer players and teaching them all the stuff? Are you willing to fight offensively against blocs to create headlines? Now I know this is something unfair of me to ask since I know you guys really cant, its a lot of hard work that goes into blocs and you simply dont have the manpower. 
---
But in that case you shouldnt be wanting too heavy handed nerfs just so you can have more fun. Instead you should be on CCP to actually give u something that suits small gang better. Cause small gang vs big gang died years ago, CCP is trying to revive it so they dont have to actually create something for small gang vs small gang instead.
---
And also, if consequences of nerfs are that we cant do something and you cant do something then nobody will do it. So who is gonna retain the new players? And the old ones for that matter. Whos gonna create the headline fights CCP uses for marketing?
---
The lack of doing these stings will cause much much more stagnation for the game as a whole.
---
Very brave of you wearing that jacket!
---
Yes, because shooting structures is literally the only type of PvP in Eve...
---
Now where's all the bitching about not being able to use 10+ drones at a time on subcaps as original CCP intended? Bring back world of dronecraft!
---
yeah i agree nullsec wants easy acess to specific wormholes like they have easy acces if wanted to k space :P you roam nullsec wormholers, nullsec should be allowed to find you as easily as you find a exit into desired hunting grounds.
---
Ah interesting. But there are also boosters without negatives
---
Most likely this... but ppl need to farm reddit karma so they just put up posts and talk out of their asses...
---
the feeling that big ships cause problems is just absurd, proliferation isn't even a problem, because by definition everyone has a capital so whats the problem.
---
The problem is people in small gangs who want to go into big block land and do small gang things and they get denied, this sounds awfully like a small gang problem, they had plenty of other places to go but insisted on the one place they had no business going, and now we have this retarded patch.
---
I wonder if the big blocks all decided to move out of nullsec and into lowsec if all the small gang people would cry even more.
---
Have you ever heard heard of Tribute? Or Deteroid/Wicked Creek/Immensea? Or the battles in X47 and UALX? 
---
Sounds like you haven’t been playing for over a year at this point.
---
Damn, 2 month to get into director position... That's way to fast!
---
Maybe it's just a dumb idea born out of spite for the recent changes.
---
Yeah, it was. We've learned our lesson the hard way, live, learn, and kill a titan I guess.
---
its true you want small gang pvp do it in lowsec/j space. Nullsec want fleetfights! Let them do that with a generator to specific wormholes so they can visit said owners and deliver them the pvp they desire. Its harder for nullsec to deliver that said pvp to specific j space inhabitants than its for the to role for a desired hunting ground. CCP will acknowledge that anyway soon in the age of chaos, since you heard the podcast and now nullsec is fucking angry with wormholers and your reddit shit.
---
Just like claythearc wrote, it’s about the same in all of them. I’d perhaps wager in the region instead depending on what you like to do when not in fleet op?
---
Which is literally not possible to do. But okey.
---
So you missed the fact that the second activity required you to be in space? Actively doing things? How are you gonna reduce that number from the MAU/DAU?
---
Fuck I’m doing it wrong then mate
---
i am more confused about the bhal that did nothing
---
I wish every dev teams were like them... Can you imagine
---
As per the service agreement for which you are paying, you're not entitled to straight answers, unfortunately. :-/
---
And tbh, straight answers are very subjective and would probably lead to accusations of partisanship, best to let CCP frame their answers tbh.
---
I think the bigger question is who the fuck cares?
---
But for one, you havent nerfed that ability. Secondly the jump drive is one of the reasons why the ship is more expensive. And thirdly they are by no means as OP as you say they are. They are far from the best choice in every situation and Im getting so tired of this argument, its a straight up lie.
---
There are tons of fights where subs are better than caps. Its just a dumb narrative that keeps getting told again and again by people who I dont think ever have even sat in a cap.
---
At least Falcon is not acknowledging our need for this as seen in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/CCP_Falcon/status/1162029042398310412). I don't care what you change CCP but if it prevents the community from coming together and showing support to other players in rough times (which is often done by Cyno Vigils) you are doing something very wrong IMHO.
---
Wow this is exactly what I was talking about! The worst thing about Eve is its reputation I reckon. Thanks
---
Its such a shitty narrative that caps are always the best choice in every situation. That fight mainly got lost simply because supers got deployed, not the other way around.
---
Not for logistics. But for a capital blob that has eyes on the other side, sure.
---
Sunken cost shmunken prost. Same with old school runescape (to a lesser degree), Honestly, that's why I switched to eve, to try something new
---
Yeah exactly, I was amazed how similar it was to the X series,  I had no idea. I loved X3 and Eve scratched the Itch of wanting multiplayer X. I'm amazed theres not more overlap between the two communities
---
Some sort of pve needs to be done to get the stuff for ships as far as I know. What exactly is the argument being presented?
---
Oh wow you mean the war where the defender didn't show up because it was pointless? Or the the war where the attacker attacked any enemy off their own tz? Sure X47 and UALX happend but were they realy a war or just a clash because of keepstar and after that everyone went back crabbing?
---
CCP needs to hire Ash
---
&gt;I don't mind if you highjack the topic;)  
---
So don't you just hate it when you've worked your ass off all week and your boss is almost never like "well done, here's some more money, also I've hogtied my hot son for us to ravage."
---
post's like this are a double edge sword, its good they get a name onto more blacklists, but at the same time you know its going to propagate the notion of "Hay lets join a corp and steal all their stuff"
---
Download pyfa and make one.. I don't understand people who ask for fits. Pyfa theory crafting is half the fun of eve.
---
Ok tbh I just got 1/3 of the way through the sisters epic arc, but its basically identical to X3 missions, so I basically can't ask for more?
---
Not in this case. CCP needs to explain in details their thought process and goals in this debacle that is the blackout, the upcoming cyno changes and such idiocy. But honestly, my issue regarding these interviews is not so much CCP answers as much as TiS playing nice with CCP and not attempting to get straight answers
---
Well this was never apart of the original plan was it? So people didnt have this disadvantage when they chose the ship. And good luck getting that SP back and being able to actually sell your caps right now. You cant just fk over a large portion of your playerbase then act "working as intented".
---
I've got the hang of wormhole sites and d-scanning the shit out of wormholes all the time. Whats a PH dude?
---
Im aware of the 2km cloaking limit, so I'm practicing the hole cloak trick/safe spot methods to travel safe.
---
I love a salty community that keeps coming back.
---
The reason being that it can be used in offensive fighting. You need a hard cyno for your ongrid super drops.
---
well i think smallgang pvp should aim for targets they can kill and thats vni's and not for targets they should just ignore like supers/rorquals. if you show up in a staging or make a gatecamp you mostly get a subcap response even in goon space. You fuck up ratting systems you get a umbrella response from anybody with an umbrella. I think this is totally acceptable. When you find it not acceptable then let Nullsec also have a option to create a system with different wormhole connection which they can role and are always in that system. So they can find the right inhabitant and bring the pvp nullsec like's to the wormhole space.
---
They also can't be named after real world drugs
---
God i hate journalists who use words like illegal without researching. 
---
Cannabis is not illegal everywhere in australia. Some states have seperate rules.
---
Terrible journalism.
---
and less than an hour after it was announced
---
Does the adc last five minutes? Cause otherwise you are still losing 300m initially just for lighting a cyno. Give it a couple of months and that number will be maybe 500m and ever increasing.
---
Yeah it's pretty annoying. just got my overviews all updated and saved.  Then I logged using my laptop, and lost a Hecate because apparently the overview settings are only saved locally. It's even more confusing when some of the diamond rats are checked, and others are not. So in my case, the haulers show up.  I'm shooting the hauler on a belt thinking "man reinforcements are slow". Then I zoom out and realize all the frigs and cruisers are there and about to fire on me, while not showing on the overview with the hauler.
---
I guess I need to mail myself a link to the updated overview settings so I can get them saved on the laptop as well.  Just another one of those "huh I didn't know that. At least it only cost me x-amount of isk to learn it".
---
Rorqual mining is still low risk. All you'll need is a cloacked recon near the belt to jump caps to.
---
Frat members pinged to move to a different country so they didn't have to fight TAPI.
---
I suggest to change your legacy timer for citadels in detorid into the cn timezone. You stop your timezone tanking and do something against the citadel spam.
---
"one would need to risk 500m per jump."
---
CCP I think hit the nail on the head with this one. Cyno's are a powerful tool. At the end of the day even if the attacker fails to kill the initial target under an umbrella, they will at least walk home with a decent killmail. This will encourage more roaming. As someone who lives/operates under hostile umbrellas, I very much welcome this change.
---
Granted this comes at the cost of large scale engagements. Which I doubt there will be many considering PanFam has consolidated with WC to form PandaB0TFam and has, arguably in an attempt to recreate what goons did after WWB in Delve, retreated into the opposite corner of the game from Imperium. Likely in attempt to content starve their foes with wet dreams of Legacy and Imperium fighting each other.
---
In my experience cynos were/are the herald of cancer more often than fun. But, ultimately CCP has to address bloc level wars and encourage more offense rather than turtling under an umbrella.
---
Not everyone has or wants a capital, I don't have a lot of experience in the bigger metagame of null in this decade, but to come from 2008 to see the most powerful ships in the universe getting dropped on you by a cheap cruiser gives me the feeling things are unbalanced and unrealistic.
---
For you to put the blame on small gangs is silly, did small groups of t3c really force the hand of CCP to change mechanics, no, null blocs gridlocking gameplay by figuring out the perfect defence solution did. 
---
It's not even a cause for shame or scorn, anyone would have done the same given the tools, but being a underdog is fun, and if you take the fun out of a game, no one wants to play.
---
If he stole from you guys, and he knew that you knew stuff was stolen and you were actively looking for the culprit, and he was worried enough to revoke ESI, why would he bother sticking around? Or, at the very least, why would he drop a titan?
---
So nobody would die is what you're saying...
---
Then why didnt they do anything against bombers right away when they saw excav kills spiking? So rapid and drastic changes are only okey when they hit one side or they are still bad at iteration, no matter what the reason is it still fks NS.
---
I don't begrudge people exploring this, most of DT have afk orcas rotating through quiet 0.5s. Remote access from work etc. 1b+ a week for almost 0 effort.
---
If it was up to me, I'd remove moon mining from highsec. /u/CCP_rise if you're listening ;)
---
What a great way of refuting me, definitely not a strawman
---
&gt;Oh wow you mean the war where the defender didn't show up because it was pointless? 
---
Yes, Panfam didn’t contest timers in systems which had their Ihubs destroyed. But we fought to keep those Ihubs alive, even if it was ultimately futile. 
---
&gt;Or the the war where the attacker attacked any enemy off their own tz?
---
So now you’re telling me Test invaded Frat and took Ihubs by only fighting in US/EU TZ? Frat must be very bad at setting vulnerability timers on structures/Ihubs. 
---
 &gt;Sure X47 and UALX happend but were they realy a war or just a clash because of keepstar and after that everyone went back crabbing?
---
Do you expect the wars to go on literally forever? People burn out from running late night ops and constantly being deployed without any way to krab. Line members need money, FCs need to relax, nobody can be constantly at war. Legacy are doing an ok job because the war is close to home so they have their umbrella still, and they did go right back to war after the 6 month treaty ran out.
---
At the same time, though, corps that have just been stolen from are theoretically worse targets for stealing stuff from, since they've been there and done that.
---
Ofc, that only applies if they actually learn from their mistakes...
---
Almost? My boss has never sponsored any group sex events, lucky.
---
Everywhere lol
---
Jesus man, get over yourself.
---
defending is always easier than attacking when you have the advantage as defender. It is so in every game in real life people didnt attack when the defender has the advantage. Most wormholers cry that the defender has the advantage and they want their super/rorqu kill with their 20man gang or less. But instead of opting for the possible they cried so many month in reddit for changes. Now they killed their easy targets in to afk mode (most smaller alliances). I think Nullsec alliances should get the same tools to invade/attack J Space. Nullsec cant reliable close a hole and get one in the same system. So i think a "W generator" which 100% gives in that system x Connections to j space. This connections can be rolled etc. like those in J Space. So Nullsec people can decide to either attack J Space inhabitants/roam them or opt for the more often used solution and PH would visit Delve and Delve would visit Ph etc. Actually this would bring more Fleet Fights from all entities than the option to not make such thing happen. And i dont talk about % Chance for connections i mean 100% 5 connections for example.
---
Imagine living in a country where we give the government the power to dictate what can and cannot be put in video games. How ridiculous!
---
^(...but don't worry guys, lootbox legislation) *^(totally)* ^(won't be used as a springboard for more draconian measures, we swear.)
---
CCP has already said that they're going to make a module that maintains the symbolism of the cyno and that can be fit on a wider variety of ships.
---
the big one is all the drugs are made up,  I think its that it was a real drug that gave you an ingame effect that caused the problem
---
Both the banned games, Dayz was weed and the previous one was a morphine or some sort of painkiller
---
&gt; Not everyone has or wants a capital, I don't have a lot of experience in the bigger metagame of null in this decade, but to come from 2008 to see the most powerful ships in the universe getting dropped on you by a cheap cruiser gives me the feeling things are unbalanced and unrealistic. 
---
No one is forcing you into a capital, if you love small gang fights stay the fuck out of mega blocks nullsec, you have the whole region of lowsec and faction warefare that's literally designed for small gang, you should not get to complain when you venture into deep water and get spanked by a bigger fish.
---
Stay in lowsec , problem solved.
---
&gt; For you to put the blame on small gangs is silly, did small groups of t3c really force the hand of CCP to change mechanics, no, null blocs gridlocking gameplay by figuring out the perfect defence solution did. 
---
It is on small gangs, small gangs and streamers, like above who want to go into the depths of nullsec right into the capitals of major powers and they complain when these empires use the power at their finger tips to shit on them. so yeah.. I blame the small gang whiners.
---
How about fixing tracking on light fighters so they actually hit for more dps than light drones when fighting bombers?
---
Late December back in '63
---
This is amazing
---
The reason people are upset is, that CCP didn't think about it before adding FAX to the game in their original form, but only after years of passively observing and silently listening to complaints.       
---
That's not only true for FAX, but for every big change.      
---
The rapid speed of punches right now leads me to hope they have shaken some of their complacency and not only patch rapidly, but also iterate at a faster pace.
---
when and where?
---
Digital Extremes are, for me at least, the gold standard for transparency and player/dev communication.
---
And learned a different language so TEST couldn't spy on them ;o
---
'content creators' is such a dumb term
---
That depends totally on where you are looking. I mean everything can always be proven just by focusing on the one thing that supports your claim. Not saying you are but I am saying its very dependent on where youre looking. 
---
Many, including me, are saying NS is the most dead its been in a very very long time. People are leaving in masses and if you check dotlan adms you can see how much less active it actually is. Zkill is also saying this and the MER that will come out soon will also say this, CCP has already acknowledged that much. And the game being in a better place depends on your perspective, I dont belive the game will be better with lesser players. Most of the issues were having has to do with too few players and not too many players.
---
But if you are looking in specific places then sure, you can find evidence that points to the opposite. And Im not even certain that these changes are behind these active zones since things happened pre blackout that could account for this.
---
yeah but why should a 20man gang kill a super without bringing in own capitals/dreads? they could try to escalate to kill big shiny things but they don't do it cause the defender has the avdantage of his home space in a non war situation, like why should a 2000 man army succesfully invade for example north dakota and plunder it etc. (ok bad example but you get the idea)
---
So instead for going for the targets they can kill via camps/roaming they want the big stuff kills which they shouldnt get. Isk cost's should be comparable in power in some relation.
---
You don't need mechanics to prevent someone from choosing.
---
He did everything he could given the fit.. :P
---
I had eyes on their fort and the bhaal's idea was to hold me and neut me for long enough for DPS to arrive.
---
Game development and is difficult.
---
And the sensor overlay toggle thing too while you're at it, https://i.imgur.com/PBNfTOK.png because attempting to lock someone who's scramming you and accidentally moving mouse 3 fucking pixels too low and then having to wait 2 seconds for it to fuck off was maybe masochistically enjoyable at first, but now it's just torture.
---
in fairness it's not a narrative. ccp have nerfed supers a lot in the last year, and as a result they aren't always the best choice anymore. but they definitely were.
---
nope the point is not even that. The point is people don't escalate on a super/rorqual with their own supers/titans/dreads etc. And then complain that the enemy instantly escalates so their 20man gang can't get a shiny big kill. But i want my rifter to kill a fucking Titan like style.
---
Hey I'm looking to join e-uni too, maybe I'll see you around! :) What's your toon's name?
---
&gt;he didnt get that role day 1 
---
Haha no i figured as much, i was laughing at the fact that someone got semi director access in under 60 days :p
---
Our government is the fucking WORST nanny state.
---
When someone spins up a titan alt 6 days after joining your corp, you should think about it at least a little.
---
Talking in whatever show interview afaik.
---
I cant say for sure, but, when we saw things that matched the criteria we screen shot it and sent it to the CEO without saying anything aloud, or to Bomb. My guess is he thought he duped us, and was just hanging around long even to get everything moved, and sold.
---
roamings shouldnt aim to kill capitals who cost 10 times the roaming fleet.
---
¡¡suɐᴉlɐɹʇsn∀ pᴉdnʇs ǝsoɥʇ ɐɥɐH
---
Dude was convincing that he had corps best interest in mind I suppose. AMD it didn't hurt his aims that we are rather small
---
nvm found out the mails have not been sent yet.
---
Imagine for a moment that they outlaw multiboxing. So many of the game's problems solved.
---
Subcaps will always be the most important ship on the field.
---
And the added fact of the embarrassment. I mean, we were made fools of, but we also felt that we needed to get his name out there for others, and give context as to why. Besides, posts of "dude is a corp thief. The end" aren't fun to read.
---
but the nano guys can't escalate they are to small, and they wouldn'T if they coudl cause the defender has the advantage so they take a target which they should not take and cry it didnt work. Hey lets take our 20 rubber dinghy with motor and attack a Navy Destroyer/Carrier and win lol.
---
Here's hoping we did :)
---
I attribute my decision to stay playing the game around the first ~week-month to a loss in low sec.  Players that quit because they get killed in low sec the first time they go there are probably a lot less common than most people realize.
---
yeah shame the fucker
---
It would have been more if legecy didn't have a subcap fleet to kill tackle so the caps could get out.
---
&gt;The worst thing about Eve is its reputation
---
There's a mildly notorious and very old description of EVE:
---
"Being a new player in EVE is like being a fresh golden haired young child who is suddenly allowed into an incredibly huge fun fair with a vast variety of rides, one that is mostly populated with pickpockets, con-merchants and pedophiles.  But if you're smart, determined and prepared to learn, then one day *you* can become one of those pedophiles."
---
The main difference between EVE and other MMOs is that in EVE you actually can be the bad guy. Playing an "Evil" character in other MMOs generally boils down to getting different looking outfits and maybe a spell/ability selection more tilted towards offence than defence. You get to do somewhat different actions, but you can't really *be* any different.  EVE is the exact opposite: everyone gets access to exactly the same items, skills and appearance and your only point of difference is what you choose to to use them for.
---
Players from other MMOs arrive in EVE, and - not unreasonably -  they assume it to be essentially similar in the way it works.  Then they get recruitment scammed, awoxed and ganked by those pickpockets and pedophiles, and EVE gets a reputation.
---
Don't make those assumptions.
---
Legend has it, Rhythmic can smell t3c's five wormholes out.
---
Nice video, love when nerds in bling t3c get their shit kicked in by t1 battleships.
---
I haven't been following up on Eve. What's this 'Era of Chaos'? Can someone update me a little? Thanks.
---
i agree honestly
---
a hacking minigame or something would be cool
---
Which is why I’ve decided to stay at in wormholes solo. But holy shit is that a good description.
---
Eve’s greatest strength is also its letdown, it lets you be the bad guy. Problem is, everyone wants to be the bad guy
---
God what a joke
---
Last time i played dayz a bunch of bandits took me and my friend hostage and forcefeed us bleach and forced us to knife fight to the death. Then a group of "heroes" said via voip that they were gonna rescue us and m4ed everyone in the room.
---
In a pocket of Abyssal Deadspace is it worth it to clear all Nodes and Subnodes?

Oi cunt you got a loicense fer that remark?

Literal cowards running away from just TEST lol!
---
&gt;Tiericide keeps getting delayed
---
Water is still wet
---
oh you too you want those dank 1bil+ per hour tick ? I mean it's not like they keep crying about our dank 120mil tick per hour
---
True true, years of silence.
---
This is probably one of your best posts. Small group guy btw.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Jammers would be used to catch dreadbombs and similar short timed attacks
---
as will dictors and hictors and normal tackle. as i see it, this new mechanic would not be used much like that
---
&gt;Jammers are exclusively used for key structure defenses, but prevent basically all these fights
---
they slow down wars a lot, but they also force the attacker to commit fleets to remove the jammers, giving opportunity for several subcap fleet fights without the threat of a capital escalation.
---
I'll stick to jspace, no silly security status, I can use whatever weapons I want, and no big group political bullshit.
---
I'm not going to hash out all the balance issues with the current system, there is plenty of discussion out there already, and it doesn't matter.
---
Because the change is coming, if you want to instantly summon the pain, you need a special ship to do it, adapt or die.
---
&gt;Problem is, everyone wants to be the bad guy
---
Well that's not quite true. It would be impossible for any groups to endure any length of time, let alone grow to the size of the ones that EVE has, if the group members didn't have a reasonably strong expectation of being able to rely on each other.
---
As loyalty and honesty won't be enforced by the GMs, reputation matters a lot. As an easy example, a lot of players who aren't in goons hate goons, because goons view everyone who's not in the Imperium as Fair Game (in the Scientology sense). On the other hand, goons *are* able to make agreements and treaties with other alliances, because they do have a longstanding reputation for keeping to those agreements.
---
If a ship can get through, all the shops can get through. Cynos don't make a line.

What interests me, however, is the sheer loyalty and dedication that some people put into eve, or even just a particular Corp, like goon. It’s rare to find such a large group of such ‘dedicated’ players for such a long time these days.
---
General settings, "tooltips delay", you can change how long you hover before the tooltip displays.
---
EvE is huge. I could think of a million things for you to focus on. A lot of pilots and FC’s overlook the importance of EWAR though. I’ve personally witnessed the deviation a single TD fit Pilgrim can have on a Lesh fleet (current WH meta) if overlooked. Neut/ewar/black Ops is all really effective and sought after by FC’s with half a brain. 
---
Ive got Indy and pvp toons, I’m not a big fan of the Indy stuff but now and then I get the urge. I prefer the pew personally.
---
There’s a lot of corps out there actively seeking new members especially those with logistic/Indy skill to help enhance the corp.
---
What's wrong with you? I checked, this hasn't been reposted because you can't even repost a link. So that's what your missing.
---
Unfortunately the skill queue is filo coded.  You can see this in action if you delete a large queue.  It. takes. forever.  Which given the relative advancement in ui performance and features in other areas of the game, leads me to believe that it is too enmeshed to mess with greatly.
---
If the job involves being in space, a lot of skill sets overlap, you can train into a lot of things quicky before specializing, so try a lot.
---
My current carriers are gas collecting, PI related production (fuel blocks), and exploration, I also partake in PVP in the defence of my corp's home system.
---
[Check out this cool chart!](http://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart-small.jpg)
---
The mind boggles as one after another they boat themselves happily into grapple range of battleships.
---
I have two questions.. Eve is fun? What's this other half?
---
CCP seriously needs to expand on all this juicy lore. I've been reading EVE lore maybe 2 years before I even started playing the game.
---
&gt; Hard cynos (as in &gt;3m ehp, ideally &gt;15m) are needed for fleet fights to happen
---
The trouble with this is the ability to instantly drop a hard cyno means you can capital blob anything. That's exactly the problem this change is designed to address.
---
Lets be honest eve is hard. Its perfectly doable to play it solo or soloish but if you dont feel like putting a significant time into it better join a corp.
---
Wormholes and lowsec are great for that gameplay. Online are all the resources for this, even some dedicated youtube channels and ppl will still give you advice for free.
---
but dont come crying when you get evicted/blobbed/dropped/ganked because no one's defending you. You will have the pride, you will have the challenge.
---
They said that miners were required to have ships.
---
I don't think 1 logo can easily keep 10 people safe, especially with no coordination.
---
Thanks for the tears over a satirical post
---
Yes, defending is easier and should be.
---
But the basis of it shouldn't be "defenders ALWAYS WIN unless they fuck up".
---
That's not good balance.
---
Disruptive gameplay needs to exist.
---
&gt; Now pretend the Imperium titans are being constantly bubbled and are unable to do anything, and that by the time they do get off grid (leaving a few dc’d pilots behind to die) they warp into drag bubbles 400km off the keepstar, and sit around doing nothing until it repairs.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Is that balanced at all?
---
Well, it's the situation that a battleship fleet would find itself in.
---
Can you cyno out of a bubble? That's pretty ridiculous if you can.
---
well, to catch really all caps of a dreadbomb is actually not that easy i learned. And you need to have enough "fuel" aka dictors to keep them bubbled. 
---
With this structure, any idiot could click one single button, and all caps are locked, waiting for their doom
---
Nice fights. updooted.
---
But song two and three kinda ruined the experience :/
---
D E L E T E C A P S
---
nah just more people that around that are to dumb to realize a smaller ship would be better for half the thing there doing.
---
Wait a few weeks ago it was those highsec guys....
---
Bill pls
---
I was thinking precisely about ewar or cover ops I love those roles but I thought there were a lot of them
---
Yeah I know the chart but I just don't know what to commit to xD
---
Ty anyways :)
---
Yeah there’s a lot of any type of pilot but not many worth their salt. I can fly ewar as much as the next person but knowing the tactics and limits and running the fleets is a different kettle of fish. 
---
Anyone can welly a pilgrim into battle of run Blops but not everyone does it successfully and turns the tide.
---
Whatever you do just remember to have fun along the way. Specialising in a specific skill is a long train and takes a long time to master. Personally I’d advise having a couple of roles per pilot. Some might disagree.
---
Eve is at its heart a social game, so if you don't act socially with people, you'll have a much worse experience. If you farm in your little corner of the world without interacting with others, it's very likely you'll find the game to be boring and quit.
---
Corps will also facilitate your life, you'll get free ships and experienced players that can help you figure out the game.
---
content creators are highly restricted in how they create engagements, you can either form a &gt;40 fleet and ask for a fight, shoot  a citadel or tackle a Rorqual, or you become a good hunter and tackle ratters in hopes for escalations, there is not really an inbetween anymore and tackling has become super easy since the blackout.
---
So I'd say it's not alliances getting the most PvP content but small corps living in wormholes with null statics, tackling and holding alot of ratters every day, creating small fights everywhere.
---
I'd love to see some metrics, but would be willing to bet there was a massive swing in people adding cov cyno skills to their queue.
---
+1 for linking charts!
---
I am a candidate for CSM in 20xx and I will implement all these changes because I think the CSM is a game development job.
---
All nullsec stations were replaced by Faction Fortizars, a Large structure that players control and can unanchor and reposition as they wish (even in another system).
---
There are still stations in hisec and lowsec, but you can now anchor citadels in all systems except some wormholes.
---
Perhaps try to counter-cycle the neutralizers going forward. If they run cap boosters this can catch their reload too.
---
Lighten up, Francis.
---
Who's the best eve influencer?
---
Why do you want to exclude faction warfare? You'll usually get more engagements than simply roaming and you can usually control your engagements to slowly get better at piloting your ship.
---
Ever heard of an MJD? And even without that, battleships can still kill interdictors pretty easily, and even if the Titans have a support fleet to handle that, battleships still align much faster than Titans, don’t bump way off a gate when taking gates as a fleet (RIP Komodo), can burn out of bubbles faster than Titans, etc.You’d never be able to permanently bubble a battleship fleet and keep them out of a fight. Doing it to a Titan fleet, on the other hand, would be almost trivial.
---
Solo orcas allow you to mine while you watch Netflix. It's slower than a lot of barges, but it will take you 3 hours to fill up your hold, meaning all you really need to do is assign each drone to a different rock and then check on it every 15mins to make sure you didn't burn through a rock.
---
It's also virtually ungankable if you fit any kind of T2 tank on it. CODE won't bother your orca, except maybe for some bumping once in a while.
---
Only problem with it now is that Triglavian rats (which are stronger than normal belt rat) have started appearing in belts, killing your drones and then slowly killing your orca.
---
Fair enough, its only his friends using blops. Doesnt change a thing because DPS is the least of a problem
---
Best afk activity you can do is orca mining in hisec, since it takes nearly 3 hours to fill up your hold.
---
Other mining you could do, but you'll have to go back to your miner every few mins to get the ore to a station and back.
---
even worse
---
/u/ccp_rise whatever you decide with cyno, make the beacon be the same like always so people can use it as a bait cyno.
---
Highest income if you have a few bils to trade with.
---
Did you win all your fights? The loss are sometimes more interesting!.. Because some wins were a bit one sided, you could have done better but you didn't need to
---
How much time do you need to get back on your orca investment?
---
Texas law is international law.
---
Interesting... so what happens with all the items inside the station when it's moved? Can the structure be destroyed when it's repositioned?
---
Can citadels be anchored in null sec systems with NPC stations?
---
disruptive gameplay exist already. You can escalate on rorqus and supers. You can split forces and attack 2 of them while escalating on one of them etc. . Now you can say but escalating on delve/pandafam/legacy won't end good well why should it? First you attack their Home, second they are the major powers of the game. When you escalate on the USA do you think you can win? :P And thats why all this arguments for small gang killing rorquals/supers is stupid, well for atleast supers. The Panic module on rorqus is a bad design decision i agree on that.
---
hmmm, gonna look into that, ty
---
Dicks will eventually bump into each other because all these people swinging theirs around all the time.
---
YOU WANT THAT!? YOU WANT SWINGING DICKS SLAPPING EACH OTHER!? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT!?
---
(Not that there's anything wrong with that)
---
I don't support. Especially if the generated wormholes would allow for capitals to be brought in - this is downright unfair towards actual wormhole groups.
---
See, you can bring in a cap and have several hundreds pilots ready to pounce on anything that decides to mess with it whereas an actual wormhole group can only bring 20-30 pilots at most.
---
On top of that: high class wormhole space is already heavily contested by wormhole groups for positions of farm holes etc and most of the political outspats happen here in highclass. Having a foreign entity mess with it would ruin another playstyle in favor of the big groups.
---
I do support low class statics, however. Giving nullgroups access to C1/2/3 means more stuff for wormholers to gank and if we can shift the income from null anoms to wormhole space sites we could look into actually nerfing null anoms because another viable alternative is now present. Bonus points because wormhole sites can't be botted and are actually hard.
---
Nope. No scamming what so ever when communicating with a Karmafleet character, its part of why we actually can help new players.
---
D is 5 characters away from K.

Since I was wondering this yesterday I’ll link you to what I emended up getting:
---
https://www.eveworkbench.com/fitting/rattlesnake/47b84f38-8ff1-405b-45e1-08d715ee4468
---
I’m in your same shoes, I’ve only been back a month after being gone 3-4 years. The only problem I’m
---
Having now is that npcs seem to be overly aggressive towards my drone every time I launch them. They almost instantly break target lock with me and happily melt my drones every time I launch them.
---
Probably. Jeronica is a pretty honest straightforward guy. Assuming you met his requirements. I think I’m in a discord with him somewhere if you have trouble reaching him DM me or something
---
It’s not about the link, friend. Also, yes you can repost a link.
---
Yeah, they will work if you fit them properly. Make sure you fit a proper T2 tank and can hit far enough to hit the sleepers, as some spawn at 65k from you. Drones and missiles usually excel at this since it's pretty to hit well at different ranges.
---
See this guide for what kind of damage you need to tank to do C1-2 (note: the DPS is what you need to tank in ehp and the repair amount given in the eve fitting tool is in hp/sec). A passive Drake is a good starter fit if you can fly it, but so are most drone based ships.
---

---
Did you play the first test? I'm going to be setting an alarm for this one, but I'd like to know what the download size will be
---
What's "this" then?
---
rage rolling needs to be removed or k space should get a generator which gives fixed amount of connections to j space and can be also rage rolled.
---
They don't escalate because 80% of null is blued up and so eventually they will get out-escalated. This has more to do with people growing a pair and not blue up anything with a pulse rather than CCP doing anything.
---
When people do escalate, it's to bait out a response fleet, which is something they've done in past to estimate the size of response fleet and then accordingly they bait it out and do a counter drop, in which case, preps of days and hours will be made before hand to ensure a superior force lands on grid successfully.
---
Nobody expects 20 man gang of rifters to kill a titan, that's frankly a hyperbole perpetuated by some people and big blue donut to oppose these cyno changes.
---
What people do expect is for 80 man t3c fleets to be able to dunk a 1 man sup or a rorq after spending hours finding, scanning and scouting that krab and his pattern and then spending hour forming fleets and getting pieces in place.
---
Currently, all that hours of work done by dozens of people can be undone in 1 second by the krab activating the cyno.
---
ok
---
Nope, allowing un-checked structure spamming was the worst idea ever !!
---
I guess there’s a few contenders for the worst change in citadel 😕
---
Theres a difference between trading poorly and feeding. It's subtle, but its there.
---
One of my strongest Eve memories was the night Leonard Nemoy died. I was in Fountain at the time, don't even remember what group I was with, but I lit a cyno above our staging station. A few fleets came tried to shoot me (it is Eve, after all), but I was kept alive by many people, both in my alliance and even enemies. The cyno burned the full two hours (that was all the LO I could fit in my Ishtar) before I docked up and logged off for the night. It was a bit silly in retrospect, but it was still one of the most special moments I've had in Eve.
---
I dont see why they cant add a subsystem to T3Cs that would allow use of a cyno whilst not being able to be fit alongside a nullification subsystem.
---
Drones in PVE:
---
As I’ve said in a could other places, I’ve been gone awhile and now  have returned. When I left I don’t recall having such issues with drones and npcs instantly breaking target lock with me to shoot them instead.
---
I see plenty of people cleaning up triglavians at gates in invasion systems with rattlesnakes and other ships using drones. How is this possible? I’ve tried to engage a couple times now and almost instantly after I launch drones they start melting because the npcs unlock me and lock the drones instead.
---
So being the largest group is the only that that should matter?
---
Is that your point.
---
how about the 10 day timers for a structure that can be farmed farmed in an hour :thinking:
---
How much do you even save by doing RMT, Instead of plex..
---
100% agreed, keepstars and sotiyos without any restrictions were one of the bigger fuckups
---
Its great to read something positive on this sub for a change, nice story, glad you got some revenge.
---
Just jump in to a wormhole and roll from there
---
Max citadel timer only for system which is alliance capital otherwise, 24h max.
---
The only check structures need is making it worthwhile to remove them. Week-long timers for nearly zero loot drop reduces the demand to kill them while supply explodes unchecked.
---
Should have made it 1-2 keepstars per region and same thing to sotiyos
---
1 fortizar per constellation and same thing to building version of it (forgot what it is called)
---
A limited number of astras/raitarus per region
---
fake cyno would be kinda fun
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78410535/
---
just jump into K space and escalate with your capitals on the umbrella is the same argument type :P
---
CCP's CEO announced this summer they would be rolling out a few very large changes with very little warning. Their goal is to shake up the stagnant environment of EVE and test some ideas they were maybe too sheepish about in the past.
---
First that meant a massive buff to randomly attacking NPCs. Then removing local chat in nullsec. Now they are limiting Cynosural fields from all ships to just 2 hull types.
---
That has some problems tho. Groups could simply max out the citadel numbers in their home area and effectively block offensive beachheads being established.
---
nope my point is that never try to bite something you can't chew.
---
You can dsirupt them and you will probably lose your escalation, but its your decision from the beginning on going for the big shiny stuff on the big super power, its suicidal.
---
CCP should try to bring small powers or mid powers the tools to do the same what big powers can without buffing the big power blocks.
---
Not sure I see the analogy exactly?
---
This, 100% the worst idea with citadels.
---
They should have made the limitations: 
---
Medium: one per moon - so you have to choose between Astrahus, Raitaru and Athanor.
---
Large: one per planet - same as above between Fortizar, Azbel and Tatara.
---
X-large: one per system - forcing a choice between militarizing the system with a Keepstar, or industrializing it with a Sotiyo.
---
And made the Palatine buildable, and limit it to one per region, it’s Capitol so to speak.
---
In situations where you expect remote reps, obviously resists have a lot of value. If their are no remote reps coming then it's just a question of them chewing through your EHP. Resist rigs help against one weapon type, raw buffer against all weapon types.
---
If you have something like an EM rig on your shield tanked ship, and you fight something with blasters, that's functionally an empty rig slot.
---
So the only winning move is not to play?
---
Well this might sound stupid
---
But why not deploy yours the moment that structure is destroyed?
---
So what solo droppers can actually kill caps in a reasonable time?
---
i agree on the rorqual, don't agree on the super. Panic Module is the big issue and HAW i agree a 80man fleet should kill a rorqu and super, and not be alphaed by HAW's. I don't agree that 20man can do a shit vs capitals. Also i suggest a Assault Damage Control type of module instead of the panic button and the module online timer should be 6minutes.
---
Azbel?
---
the winning move is to not fucking try to kill a super under an umbrella but the shitty small stuff, make a gatecamp have eyes on their staging etc.
---
I got my feet wet in tier 1 abyssal space yesterday solo with a hawk. It was lots of fun. I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OBbju-Uhes and decided to try it out. As he states in the video just go for the main cache. I found yesterday just doing the tier 1 filaments that the other nodes only ever had about 600k to a million isk of loot in them.
---
You are.  Go out there!
---
&gt; And even without that, battleships can still kill interdictors pretty easily
---
So can carriers or supers. I don't think it's a bad thing that you need some support.
---
&gt; even if the Titans have a support fleet to handle that, battleships still align much faster than Titans
---
Well sure, they're smaller
---
&gt; don’t bump way off a gate when taking gates as a fleet
---
CCP should do something about this, making the landing zone bigger if the ship is bigger or something. Getting randomly bumped away from your fleet is a bad mechanic and not fun for anyone.
---
&gt; no, you can’t cyno out of a bubble, the fact that you don’t know that pretty much proves you have no idea what you are talking about
---
Well, I didn't think so either. So what is the point you were trying to make there? A bubbled titan fleet can't get out of those bubbles with or without the ability to light a cyno on any ship.
---
Always. Nothing will change that.
---
But you just said this game is dead, what is it? 
---
It's this game dead or are you having no issues fighting those groups?
---
A well argued post
---
They said in their last talking in stations podcast that revamping faction warfare is something they want to do. It's a topic that the CSM also brought to the table.
---
Now, without an announcement of "this is coming in the next patch", we can never be sure that CCP does anything, but it's the first time in years that they mentioned faction warfare, so it's at least a bit of hope for fwers.
---
Through different times on and off sure. But we cant use old data to support todays conclusion. They are atm not the best choice which means that arguing for further nerfs based on that argument is bad. And also, subs have always been needed for grid control, this didnt change with the nerfs. When people drop supers for defense it doesnt mean that the attacking subcaps just implode, they just cant take the fight anymore.
---
sad thing about the palatine it costs absurdly more than a keepstar! has not the cost relation to tankiness stats of a normal keepstar to palatine and isnt even bigger.
---
Karmafleet
---
It wouldn't be dumb at all. In fact, it would probably become a standard defensive move. If you could only put down 4 x-large structures in a region and 4 large structures per constellation, every large alliance could manage that fairly easily. Then it's just a matter of spamming cheap medium citadels until the cap is reached, which would probably end up being cheaper than the xlarge/large structures combined. (Depending on exact numbers.)
---
Given how much of an advantage that would give you over attacking forces by default, it would be downright stupid *not* to do this. And if the game didn't restrict you to *where* in the region those medium citadels had to be... pile them up around the second keepstar, so that you could both stage sub-cap protection right next to them, and have your super/cap forces in easy and relatively safe drop range of them.
---
yep Structures should have 2 Timers. Shield/50% Armor. Armor/Structure NO damage cap and of course allow remote repping to counter.
---
- Double the Asset safety fees and asset safety fees goes  to wallet of people as per damage %. You do not get that fee if you attacked but if cit that blew up was your alliance's or alliance you were blue to at the time. Regardless of asset safety,  all neut/red attackers get isk bounty as per value of the citadel. Call it Upwell Recycling credits or w/e.
---
- Also unfueled cits get 2 timers 24 hours apart (or 1)
---
- Double the base fuel costs of Citadels. Increase it exponentially if citadel type / alliance goes beyond 5-10-15, scale it up exponentially. The scale is more aggressive as per citadel type. So more expensive to have more fortizars and even more expensive to maintain multiple keeps.
---
Also increase fuel costs per number of ship types parked in it. More Titans parked in keep = more fuel costs.
---
At certain point, too much krabbing and expansion has has diminishing returns, like in RL empires, the bigger they get, the harder and more expensive it gets to manage them. Will also motivate people to go get shit blown up.
---
Gonna get down voted by turbo blue donut Krabs tho :-(
---
When you explain the simple chain of ISK transfer, you'll realize this isn't remotely close to perfect.
---
Yeah, I mean CCP has been bullshitting about fixing bumping for years. It's a really broke mechanic. 
---
And yeah, if you fixed bumping, that would be half of the problem with warping supercaps. The other half is landing in defensive bubbles.  Subcaps can ping around them, caps are just way too slow.
---
The point is you can’t move a capital fleet to a specific point on a grid if someone is trying to stop you and has a bunch of dictors. That is why they need to be able to cyno in. 
---
Sub caps have a lot more options. Booshers, MJDs, even the deployable jump unit. They are also more mobile and can burn into position even if they are initially dragged off. You’ll never see someone successfully waterboard a battleship or HAC fleet when they are already in the same system as their destination. The same is not true for capitals
---
You're espousing the same levels of entitlement as everyone else... vote with your wallet.
---
Nullsec is stagnant, do you enjoy that?
---
&gt; Sub caps have a lot more options. Booshers, MJDs, even the deployable jump unit.
---
A capital MJD would be an interesting idea. Don't forget this works both ways though - you can't break up a capital blob or move their logistics away with a MJFG. So actually maybe capitals being jump immune is bad from both sides of the spectrum.
---
Why is he like this? Cyno changes, wife left him or his dog was rival alliance spy?
---
Im part of a rental alliance in Test territory and after the blackout I've seen active player counts drop by at least 30% for the alliance and over 50% for the corps I'm in. Blackout has made it harder for small groups in nullsec to survive imo. I've been debating joining test just to survive and make isk.
---
It's significantly cheaper, if I had to guess, I'd say about half.
---
Don't let that tempt you though, if CCP discovers it (No real way of knowing how they track it, so claims of "100% safe methods" are BS), they'll subtract that amount from your wallet. 
---
If you spent it, you'll go negative and won't be able to do quite a few things that rely on market/wallet activity, such as setting up contracts, selling on market, etc.
---
I knew a Corp mate years ago who got caught doing it and they neg'd him. I just remember him whinging about how he couldn't do anything until he bought a bunch of plex to sell to get positive again.
---
You are strong.
---
Bettet to split it all up, where possible. Reduces losses. But since he was semi-director, doubt it could've been reduced
---
Valk is r/eve \#1 content creator
---
This is what I was thinking as I read the post as well...in fact:
---
&gt; but its not warpable
---
This is the one part I would strike out. Not jumpable...absolutely. Not warpable? Where are the lulz in that?
---
Maybe, and this is one of those cases where I hope I'm wrong and shit more or less stays the same, but when someone who has been throwing super fleets around for years has nothing to say but "bullshit", I don't feel good about the chances I'm wrong.
---
If they made it into a Region's Capitol, they could add related effects to it, and make it a target for war.
---
Why should a super be able to pve in 99.99%  safety under an umbrella?
---
Skill injectors mean the default pve ships of choice are caps and superstars under an umbrella.
---
It’s more of a raid analogue than an invasion. The current situation has the defender able to instantly teleport a large portion of their navy to any attacked pve structure.
---
The changes mean the defender has to put more thought into defending their isk faucets than ‘instant cyno, super spam’.
---
Greed? Confidence?
---
That doesn’t make any sense though. T3 Cruisers should continue to be able to fit Cynosural Field Generator I’s. There should be an option for a nullified hunting ship that can drop a Dreadbomb.
---
You should have said.. any isk you paid would be doubled
---
Ccp doesn’t ‘need’ to explain anything.
---
So basically being the biggest kid should guarantee you win every fight.
---
That's the problem.
---
Prepare to be neutered.
---
Cause making space coffins is such a great mechanic.
---
You don't know anything about rorquals either, huh.
---
20 man raid a bank but not a military target with in range of air support etc. The analogy goes into both ways. As i said nope to 20man raids vs supers pick your targets to your strenght and you win.
---
You sound like the snowflake
---
You should learn what evident means.
---
It just dropped. Check your email
---
OK 👍👍😂😂😂
---
you should learn to make arguments or STFU when you have none.
---
It doesn't help CCP just expects players to have to patch their own configurations. 
---
&gt;Hey here's new content, now fix your overview so you can see it
---
Stop being such a miserable cunt.  Gtfo and dont bring yourself back here again..
---
Meh, you could hide them in a pos before and just go about your day also. The only difference is you could siege a pos, camp it and evently get the kill. Unless they stay logged off for months. That is no longer possible. As you can asset safety a super. Personally i believe in asset safety, but not for caps
---
Unless it was changed recently, you can't use an ansiblex with an aggresion timer.
---
good idea
---
OP fucked up opsec, on my way to fuck yo fort
---
Cool story bro ! (No irony)
---
The thing is, it’s not just one problem. It’s not just the lack of MJD, the bumping, the slowness to align, its all of that. If you give caps and MJD and don’t fix bumping, you’ll still have caps getting catapulted at crazy speed when jumping to a cyno, and you’ll have to wait for everyone to align before you can warp, and then they’d hit a drag bubble and have to align + MJD two more times to get in range. And of course suicide ceptors would warp in as soon as the spool started to shut it off. 
---
Basically, it would just be completely cancerous, especially considering that it would all happen at 10% speed with people disconnecting throughout.
---
Lol excavator tears.
---
Doesn't EVE have an npc item of tampered dolls with drugs inside :D
---
Your ‘military target’ are pve supers and capitals fit and used for the singular purpose of being a space bank.
---
For your line of argument to hold we would need to remove the ability for all capitals / supers to pve including the rorq.
---
Did... Did you try checking the existing contracts to get an idea what it might sell for?
---
Either way, it's a pretty goddamn low-tier drop, so don't get your hopes up.
---
Not sure why you expect this to be an unpopular opinion. Keepstars were a mistake in every way. They should literally just be turned into a faction fort next downtime and game would instantly be better.

As much as I like being able to dock mine, I've long considered it a bad idea. The inability to dock was a balancing factor, and it's needed a lot more now than ever, though I'd let the Palatine Keepstar retain that functionality; maybe if we give it enough unique abilities like that someone will actually care enough to try to build one some day (probably not, though).
---
There should also be some mechanic in place to prevent massive numbers of them from being built and stockpiled to instantly replace losses. If you lose a super/titan, you should have one less of that ship type to field until you can build another one. Unfortunately, the ubiquitous scourge that is skill injectors would likely undermine these measures by providing easy carriage alts, but at least that would be more cost/effort than it is currently.
---
T3Cs already have a special penalty attached to losing them, so how about one for titans/supers: if a character loses a titan or super, it is unable to pilot another one for a certain period of time (probably the build time of the ship in question). You could just lock the titan/carrier skills for a period of time, kind of like how omega skills are locked for alphas. That WOULD prevent the use of regular carriers, too, but I think the game would survive that catastrophe.
---
...then again, skill injectors would ruin THAT fix, too. Seeing a pattern here, CCP?
---
Certainly not. But a T3C will probably be *best* for that purpose.
---
Can you explain how Im doing that?
---
Please dont sit there and pretend like I havent voiced concerns against certain things that create stagnation or that I havent presented ways of lowering it. And thats what Im still doing, these changes are counterproductive and will in fact create more stagnation. Just because a small group that doesnt actually live in NS think they wont doesnt mean shit because they dont understand the mechanics well enough.
---
The data is already showing less activity and thereby more stagnation. Nothing real has happened in terms of actually lowering it. Its just that people think it has.
---
you've got a great imagination bordering on schizophrenia
---
What does AWOX mean ? Im noob .
---
Theres gotta be downsides for the best supcaps in the game
---
thanks
---
This won't stop someone from dropping caps it just makes it harder for the second guy to drop caps to respond. So in a lot of situations. If you don't drop first. Go home. This change makes it worse.
---
Reset your standings bro.
---
Main problem - damage limit and unavailable shoot (by atrakers) many structures per time interval. Yes, you can split your fleet, but it usually bad idea.
---
I wonder what the limitations are there for to begin with. Only 1 timer is running for each active character at any given moment, so it can't be server or database load. Then what?
---
Corps Diplomatique
---
Calm down miner
---
So if they're already like any other ship class then why do we need to make them softer?
---
Are you calling the ship a penis?
---
CTRL+F9
---
Yeah we've just been bashing citadels week after week hoping people will form for them. Bring thirty guys and they still won't form. What are we suppose to do? Cloaky camp some miners instead?
---
That's the same what I found. Thanks for confirmation
---
Maybe five man gangs shouldn't be picking fights with ten thousand man alliances.
---
Roams are fun, but not at this point in my life.           
---
To much time and attention required.           
---
Like do you think that my wife will take kindly 2hours of "**not now**" every day as i am roaming. Honestly i can say no, she will not take this well.           
---
But once per month bigger fleet while she is not asleep - yes, probably 2-3 more while she is asleep.         
---
From time to time a huge slug fest is also something that "a relationship" can survive, even if she is not happy ^(very, very unhappy)
---
The issue is that the second a fax (+ maybe a carrier or two) enters grid vs any fleet with less than 100 guys the rorq/super/whatever is guarenteed to be saved, the FAX lands ongrid and provides an unkillable cyno that will stay up as long as the defenders need to form enough caps.
---
Yeah but when you have several hundred pilots flying through your space every day looking for VNIs to kill you stop trying to form. Especially in Blackout. Gives us even more reason just to drop the supers.
---
Clear cache has fixed this for me temporarily in the past. 
---
If you ctrl alt delete to bring up the windows login dialogue, sometimes this makes the activity bar appear for me on top of the otherwise black screen. Then I can esc and log off. I play windowed. 
---
Good luck. I’ve submitted multiple tickets for this and if clearing the cache doesn’t work, I think they just get deleted.
---
I don't trust the people who broke the game to improve it. Do you?
---
I member back in the day, super builders would require many alts to sit in the super.
---
If no buyer was lined up, means a forced bottleneck supply of supers..
---
Such simpler times
---
That's Eve in a nutshell though. Almost everybody belongs to one of the cults.
---
Doing things also broke the game though. Forgive me for not being so optimistic.
---
You may want to sit down for this. Imagine.. if you will.. a way that you could possibly roll let’s say a.. Wormhole by entering a wormhole and rage rolling it yourself. Now of course this would take a certain amount of effort and time which would take away from your intensive spod harvesting. I also understand that it would be difficult scanning, one and rolling it without a “Strategic FC”present to hold your whittle hand.
---
1v1 me on Rust noob
---
not unpopular. Plenty agree. Docking supers was a dumb decision.
---
Not according to CCP. Sorry kiddo.
---
I was thinking faction Titans could be given the role of hard cyno. One hell of a price to pay if you don't hold grid after using it though.
---
You realize you can just roll it off, stranding them in kspace right?
---
Most people have already shifted away from ratting. We're all Rorq mining now. The plan from now on is to turtle even harder. I've always hated mining and I've always hated the idea of doing it in a fleet but what do you know. It's the best thing to do now. Can't sub cap rat anymore. Advice to new players? Inject and get a Rorq. What a time to be alive...
---
Gotta be the healthiest guy in Eve now
---
So this strange problem started to occur with my EvE client when I copy something in-game like a character name and then paste it somewhere outside of game:
---
&lt;font size="14" color="#bfffffff"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="14" color="#ffd98d00"&gt;&lt;a href="showinfo:5//30003136"&gt;character name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="14" color="#bfffffff"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;
---
Before I could directly copy/paste only name into zkill for example, but now some styling code gets copied as well.
---
Any ideas why this happens or how to fix it?
---
How ironic your only arguments are logical fallacies.
---
no
---
being able to dock is fine, but being able to dock hundreds of supers in a station for absolutely no upkeep is a bigger problem. there should be a cost to stockpiling so many supers, it would constrain active cap groups + reinforcements, where as now it's effectively infinite for 0 cost
---
Are you chained up in someone's basement irl then?
---
How ironic your argument are litteraly nothing.
---
&gt;Have you ever conducted diplomacy by gunpoint? Then you might be a content creator.
---
Diplomacy is removal of content, not creating.
---
He sounds pretty chill to me.
---
This one time I was mad and forgot I was gay,
---
Am I worthy to be a content creator?
---
Almost as if I'm not arguing anything. 
---
😱😱😱😱
---
Because the only way to prevent someone from choosing is by physically restraining them, of course…
---
yes, you are just being a dick. I block you, have fun being a dick alone.
---
Xddddddddddddddddd
---
They could add a cyno ammo for the festival launcher.
---
It doesn't stop people from dropping caps it just makes it harder for team two to drop their caps in response. If team one drops first that's already a huge advantage. Hilmar was never a bright guy in the past so I don't understand why people think that's changed at all.
---
Judging from your comment history, I'll never be alone.
---
Yea cause people never forget a step, or are too lazy. Oh wait that happens all the time. Like when a fleet aligns. Does everyone do it even though its easy? NOPE. This is going to add another layer of required tasks to be safe, and some people will not do it. It also has the added benefit of knowing when someone is going to be a fuckboy and drop a super on your small frig/cruiser gang in lowsec/null. Ya know like how it is with BLOPS drops right now.
---
Mate, it's a big leap from "keep something illigal out of the media" to "stopping kids spend endless money in online casinos will lead to full governmental control of our media"
---
Legislation regarding loot boxes is the same as legislation regarding gambling, it's spending money on a chance to get something you want.
---
In a casino you want more money, but in loot boxes you want a cool skin. Just because it doesn't have a direct monetary value applied to it doesn't mean it's not the same.
---
Hell yeah brother, cheers from Iraq
---
10/12 guess I'm better than I thought.
---
So what removed your agency? Is someone blackmailing you? Is your mother a hostage? Blink twice if they are listening now
---
unless you trusted your corp mates that pos would need to be a personal pos, so the onus of fueling and setting it up would be upon the specific super pilot. It was a huge commitment compared to the current "lmao just dock it", and served as an extremely elegant and effective balancing factor
---
and thats before mentioning how much better pos + station mechanics were compared to citadels but that's beating a dead horse
---
Discussing where to fight is still diplomacy.
---
What are you even talking about ?
---
I am saying people who play miner in Eve may not have actually chosen this activity.
---
What does someone mother comes here ?
---
I wouldn't share that, it's attached to you.
---
Thanks man. Hows the weather over there!!
---
When you click on the post and already know it’s gonna be Vonhole lol.
---
How to subtle trappings of southpark will be forever entwined within our culture....lol
---
No its not. Except if you want to warp around cloaked and only kill ratters.
---
Use a t1 destroyer / T3D to get more people to fight you in small stuff.
---
Killing ratters gets boring after a while
---
The October Shareowner Metrics devs need to hit for Hilmar to get his sales bonus.
---
He is a shitstain imo.
---
legit, keep at it.
---
Thankfully you posted this right in time, so now CCP will be able to backpedal on the changes, drop all the work put into it and implement the change in a completely different way that noone proposed before and they were completely unaware of!
---
Hell ya! Trying to change my embarrassing killboard. Im all snuggly. No one calls me snuggly except for my wife. And that only happens behind closed doors
---
Make a cyno where the check on weather you are in a fleet before activating is reversed.
---
You can check against existing contracts, additionally, you can plug that blueprint into something like fuzzworks.co/I'm/blueprint and whatever the profit amount is is the cap on the blueprints value.
---
To kill one of your own team
---
And not anticipating it is their fault. Most people seemed to agree that it was a stupid idea but they did it anyway. And here they are again. Not listening to people. You're going to have to forgive people for having so little faith in CCP right now. Everybody wants to see it as if there's only two sides you can be on and everybody is only looking out for what personally benefits them. That's not true. I live in null sec I've always lived in null sec. Fuck Rorqs. Fuck supers. Fuck all capital ships. Fuck citadel spam. Fuck skill injectors. Nobody in their right mind thinks this shit has been healthy it's like people just want to pretend that we already don't agree with that. Commissar is right. Null sec has been warning about this shit for half a decade. I didn't switch out of sub cap ratting to Rorq mine and own super capitals because I wanted to. I did it because that's the game that CCP made me play.
---
Oh good, arranged fights, the pinnacle of eve.
---
How about this: combat interceptors can light a cyno
---
It's great that we have so many bad features to compete for the worst change of the Citadel expansion.
---
A lot of the special perks that supercapitals get - eg EW immunity - were historically justified by the "floating coffin" excuse.
---
Treat supers and titans like "T2" carriers and dreads. Take away the special immunities. Make them reliant on subcap escorts. Stop them being better at applying to small/medium ships than battleships. 
---
End the privileges.
---
I have to disagree.
---
While super proliferation is seen as bad by some EvE players (not myself, so bias) the sitter or lock up a character aspect of old was dumb.
---
Forcing you to either not play a character or pay for a second account is not good for players. Being forced into using multiple accounts or locking out a main to experience the culmination of tons of training and time spent in game is not very rewarding. It's very much a $15/month or time spent grinding isk requirement and that to me is bad design. Having limiting factors relying on RL cash isn't acceptable in most games. At my max I was spending $60 a month to play EvE. Not as hardcore as some and not something I couldn't afford at that time but now I can't. So 2 alt accounts are mostly useless and can't log in same time. Now I'm completely unsubbed but while from a business sense forcing multiple accounts for money is good, I think it's unethical.
---
The system we have now is far from perfect but it makes more sense to me that we can dock supers. Having one pilot trapped is also not good design. If you want to fly subs and do sub stuff you're either competing with a sitter or titan for training or have another account. I remember having no sp four times and doing that all over again, especially pre-injector, is something I never want to do. Sure the bazaar exists but supply of those characters is limited.
---
Having a super per KS limit would probably be a good thing but having no way to dock, especially with POS shields going away, is just asking to get your stuff stolen.
---
We can be friends. What a imminently reasonable way to argue. Bob bless.
---
To kill someone in your same corp/alliance or any other blue.
---
Clearly the best content creators are the Super pilot who is half afk without being on comms or in fleet or the Rorq pilot mining while watching  big booty bitches on his other screen. The true content creators. For without their dim witted slow reaction times and lack of situational awareness the fruits of content can not be born. Hats off to the AFK supers and Rorqs. I’d give you a shout out but they most likely are too afk to even see that.
---
Once upon a time there was a character named Awox, who so enjoyed murdering corpmates that his name got made into a verb.
---
This one sucked, folks harassed and stayed in our hole for a week, they wanted a ransom or a fight, ended up giving them the fight, they left.
---
The whole original plan for it was to be the titan of the modern age, but this time CCP actually made it outrageous enough to build so they couldn't be spammed even if you had a bunch of bots harvesting resources for it.
---
I absolutely agree with number locking per solar body. Perimeter is a huge mess because everyone is spamming their citadels, it's similar in a bunch of null systems too. Make a patch where systems with too many citadels have ALL of them enter permanently vulnerable states with one less timer, until enough are destroyed to permanently disable the vulnerable state by preventing planting more citadels in the system. This way the system couldn't be abused.
---
THAT would be a proper hurrah for the "Chaos" age.
---
Nope dude is the best content creator this side of the Galaxy.
---
&gt;though I'd let the Palatine Keepstar retain that functionality
---
no, no structure should, even meme ones cause who knows if in the future ccp decides to tweak yield numbers and now palatines are common, and the problem comes back.
---
&gt;There should also be some mechanic in place to prevent massive numbers of them from being built and stockpiled to instantly replace losses
---
not being able to dock them would help a lot with that, although i dont think this is something that should be adressed directly
---
&gt;T3Cs already have a special penalty attached to losing them, so how about one for titans/supers
---
no, sp loss is a retarded mechanic and needs to be taken off the game, not proliferated. Titans/supers losing sp upon death will just make people who actually have balls and risk their supers to be locked out of them and not affect the nullbloc standing fleet/titan main that drops his supers only in range of a fax cache, alsp remember that for those skills don't mean shit, they're not gonna die anyway unless they fuck up massively, for those risking shit in hostile waters tho, every single skill bonus counts.
---
Uhhh, pretty sure that lack of fleet discipline is already alive in well in Wangsspurn my friend.
---
Not so much salt as the sweet taste of revenge.
---
It’s called whenever goons and test have frenemy brawls
---
Really like the maintenance cost scaling up with capitol ships docked
---
Don't you think that if Capitals would not have jumpdrive it would aplify the problem of one group being able to use them and the other is not? If you have to warp Caps to grid (if the tackle of the group that already IS on grid ever lets you do that) you are almost always in the worse position to the other capitals.
---
Shoot friends
---
Ok, nice story of revenge, but the guy was essentially a red flag walking around... I hope you guys have at least learned something from this and avoid similar mistakes in the future.
---
Those numbers are far too high and a hard limit approach is very clumsy.
---
Make upkeep cost scale with the structures around. The goal should be very few keepstars maybe 1-3 per region. 0-2 forts per constellation. And there should be systems without structures at all. Something like that could be achieve if keepstars for example increase upkeep for all systems in x lightyears (and same region), forts in y lightyears and so on. Different numbers for different securities. Highsec should scale slower than null. Needs a special look at WHs, too. Keepstars in a WH. yak!
---
Do you undock? Then you are a content creator.

/u/olmeca_gold
---
Small risk mitigation steps go a long way but I think you also acknowledge that 50 days to Director is a sizable part of the issue. 200 billion access is really substantial though... mitigating that risk will always counter convenience but its a trade off. I'd suggest regular slimming of the corp hangars, just thinking maybe there were one (10) too many hulls or dead space mods hanging around.
---
That said, social engineering is the main hackers key to security compromise. A solid revenge though.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong,
---
but wasn't this the same thing you could do with poses? Like I understand killing a pos and killing a citadel are 2 different things, and you had much more moons that maxing out a system was probably a lot more aids, but the concept still existed then right?
---
Pretty spot on to be honest. I would be glad to see them no longer docking.

If you want brainless carebears to rat and pay tax they need to dock.

Very much this, I would just fit that into every single ship I have to troll people the first days after the patch.
---
when that same person robs the corp without getting his titan safe
---
lmao
---
 I am very gay and retarded
---
Some of the citadels were intended to replace POS'es, which were limited to 1 per moon. 
---
If they want to remove POS'es, there needs to be something that can anchor on each moon, with the usability of POS'es, basically the medium citadels. But I agree that maybe the x-large should be one per constellation, instead of one per system. In general the free-for-all citadel spam is broken, and something must be done.
---
Why do you think highsec should scale slower than null? Highsec, and low-sec, have plenty of stations, if anything it should scale much much higher because of that fact alone.
---
Someone doesn't own a map.
---
Ah, ok. Thanks. I didn’t realize :p
---
what he said is mostly correct, but ignore that chart, there is nothing more misleading and outright wrong than that fucking chart
---
 And then your fleet of 50 Titans gets hardcountered by 100 newbie Crucifiers... yeah no thanks
---
exactly, to much subcap proliferation!
---
Palatine Keepstar has a hard cap of one being deployed at a time; it CAN'T be proliferated.
---
I didn't say supercapital pilots should lose SP on ship loss; I said they should be temporarily unable to reship into another supercap.
---
You want to retry
---
the underlying data structure used is irrelevant when we're talking about the speed it actually works rn.No matter which one is used there's no reason it should be this slow

At least it was a damper on supercap proliferation.

That was in patch notes. I think there's supposed to be a "copy without formatting" option on the context menu.

Im in Aus and its not the nannying that bothers me. I have worked 2 contracts into government and competency / appropriate skilling / spending your time being half good at your job is the issue. That's the cringe imo. Analogies of clowns and circuses come to mind. Eek!
---
Note that I said "nullsec solo dunks". A semi-half fair fight is not a "dunk".
---
Live and learn right?  Besides when anybody gets permissions in a management position there always a chance they might up and run with isk. It’s a risk we all take as CEOs and Corp management.  Calling us foolish, eh maybe, but sometimes it’s hard to tell who will do what.
---
Eh, its just a video game, wish they'd dictate that processed slop wasnt put on our supermarket shelves - that'd be better for everyone.
---
a *lot*. Last time i checked 10 injectors were like 40 dollars, 15 dollars rn buys you 2 and change.
---
There are things you won't be able to do solo.
---
I played alone for kind of a long time. Bring in a corp with active members is way better.
---
How about a simple one: Pre-populate the field for applying skill points to be the number required instead of blank.  Not epic for QOL but it also has to be dead easy.  Related: Allow applying a number other than “all of your” skills points to the queue.

Your *unescorted* fleet of 50 titans.

Yea, back in the olden days things like sov also depended on POSs, and it was aids on a level that most EVE players today can't even comprehend. Bad as the current sov system is, people from back then are just praying CCP doesn't touch it again, because we've seen how bad it can get.
---
But there's little comparison between today's structure cancer and the old POS mechanics. If you had control over a system/area for a couple of days, you could clear out all POSs within that time period with just a handful of dreads to do the actual bashing. There was no such thing as a 10 day reinforcement period set for 4AM on a Wednesday. They could try to ration the stront to make you either do the reinforcement or the final kill in their TZ, but there were far better counter-plays to TZ tanking for POS than there are for citadels.

Yeah cuz forcing me to to basically have a character always in my super is such a great idea forcing me to have an alt in order to play the game. You should be able to do everything in the game on one character and with docking supers you can.
---
Just part of the game. You gambled on a relationship.
---
Yeah, you guys lost some stuff. But I'm sure that it brought the guys that got burnt a little bit closer which is a net gain in my eyes. The revenge was just the cherry ontop.
---
Do you have any postkill salt? Any justification? Any pleads for forgiveness? Or just a ban from comms?
---
Correct

Thanks for coming! &lt;3 Miss you doods
---
Join NC, youll never have a problem undocking again
---
You need to be very careful with structure limits.  Megablob entities will just max out those limits and make it impossible to aggressively drop citadels against them.
---
Ya I'm slightly poking fun because of this reason, but it does kind of bum me out to see them diminished to a small pocket in Tenerifis from what they once were
---
this is exactly correct.
---
I think you underestimate humoure
---
We saw this pop up on Zkill last night during a fleet and were speculating about what it could be. Nothing we guessed was anything close to this. Great story.
---
So the worst thing about citadels is unchecked structure spam, and your solution allows dramatically more citadels per system than currently exist in nearly any system in the game, save a scant few outliers.
---
It's already been brought up multiple times and Rise made a statement on TIS that he very much cares about keeping cyno vigils and is looking into a way to make that happen with these new changes.
---
same applys to a generator and people go into that j space wormhole system. inhabitants can roll the connection and make them stranding in j space.
---
Not a carrier hunter, but this is how it used to be. If you dont want the risk, then you don't get the higher ticks.
---
Fair points.
---
1. I don't think you addressed monopolisation: 0.1 % today 2.5 % later. It's Eve, you can expect people to be Mr Nice today and mr "give me your money" tomorrow . 
---
2. personally Im incredibly lazy - Ill move shit when I can calulate the isk/hr for the effort  (not kidding). I don't really want to faf with y massive inventory and station containers to organise multiple trading bases. 
---
3. someimtes I roll high price sell orders 3 months over. I only want to pay a brokerage or fee once... so the risk of getting flushed is relevant. In Rens / Frarn for example I think some of the player owned stations have changed hands / gone pop... or they did 
---
Anyway, I guess they are my reasons, I cant explain for other people or why exactly they havent been adopted.
---
Reboot your brain and try posting then

never got the shakes, or did fc but a lot of the rest especially helping new players and giving out free ships.

Or you have a mobile subcap response fleet rather than assuming that (super)caps are the most viable and reasonable response to anything that comes into your space.
---
Imagine if the delve standing fleet was muninns or something that could move around quickly instead of faxes and titans and those were only brought out to fight larger heavier fleets. It's almost like there might be some balance to the game again.
---
Move it to the top, scram icon will appear under the cap.
---
Eve is not life.

O.o I remember carriers using drones instead of fighters and having more ehp than they do now...
---
Eve can teach you the way fot the wife so she doesnr seek bbc.

Yes but there is no reason 20 bombers which cost 50m a piece should be allowed to come in kill a capital in under 2 minutes and get out with 0 risk at all.

Are you high? It has a powerful and consistent dmg system drones and ability to brawl high dps or rail lite abusing drones either way.

CCP rise interview on talking in stations
---
1. CCP believes they've already fixed the super cap ratting problem, and that bounty income is dropping so fast they may have to do something to plus it up in a few months. 
---
2. This completely contradicts their design goal of getting rid of POS code.  They didn't allow docking in stations when supers were introduced because POSes existed.
---
3. Your real issue is with skill injectors, even if you don't realize it.
---
4. The little guys are always going to be fucked harder by changes like this than the big guys.  All the big alliances have safe stagings and players with enough alts to coffin in their big shit like they used to before keepstars were a thing. They've already lived through this era and know how to deal with it. 
---
This is another change that would merely be an inconvenience while not actually accomplishing anything.
---
Talk to some corps and alliances to see if anyone needs your copies then sell directly to them. But I’m sure if you just set up some contracts in Jita at the right price someone will buy them sooner or later. If they’re slow sellers then you’ll have to be patient or choose something else to sell.
---
Friend, mate, what's next? Please avoid commenting non sense and acting superior after again thanks.

With blackout you have zero counterplay.. so if you do increase the risk drastically but don't touch the reward.. people will leave nullsec ( or the game ). We are reaching a point where it's not worth to be a sov holder cause you don't have the reward ( people won't rat in subcaps /normal caps ). So you have no adm, no tax and fewer active players ( cause they aren't logged in )
---
Lmao stop trying to metagame brisc, you’ve already damaged the health of the game enough
---
Rail kiting fit it will be inferior to a Ferox and just as expensive. There’s no need for an armor rep bonus when you have logi, so that is wasted, and drones are slow to move, especially if the enemy is booshing. And you don’t generally use brawling cruiser fleets for much of anything,
---
"Nothing political", proceeds to link a political joke made with a killmail...
---
Xi Jinping is the head secratary of the communist party in China. Hong Kong is in the throes of ongoing protests against the Chinese government.
---
You are not spamming local chat with them enough.
---
Is it out yet?
---
I would have rather them just made lighting a cyno polarize your hull, dropping your resistances to 0. This just kinda seems like a change for change sake.
---
Counterpoint, you shouldn't need to drop offensive current style structures. There should be FOB style temporary structures for attacking.
---
 I bring out all the best morons on this sub.
---
That could work too. You have to deploy it, taking a certain amount of time, like say a minute. And the moment this deployment begins it appears in overview like cynos do. Can be cheap, and super easy to destroy for everyone who wants harass you. Making it useless for hotdropping/umbrella defense and other stuff that requires immediate cyno jumps.
---
Come create "content" with me. 😘😘
---
&lt; people won't rat in subcaps
---
Sure they will. There are people like me who don't have caps to rat in anyways.
---
&gt; Palatine Keepstar has a hard cap of one being deployed at a time; it CAN'T be proliferated.
---
so its even worse then, literally just one group will have access to it at all times if it comes to it.
---
&gt; I didn't say supercapital pilots should lose SP on ship loss; I said they should be temporarily unable to reship into another supercap.
---
the end results are literally the same, people actually risking their shit will get punished with an arbitrary cooldown and those that aren't get no drawbacks
---
Snuff is trash anyway :P
---
Those were the good old days. Sentry ratting.
---
The ticks are not worth it anymore from what I've heard...
---
Sure there is. It's meant to be a counter to larger ships counter. And they 20v1'd you.
---
It's a shame because fighting an upwell structure is not nearly as interactive as attacking a POS was. With repairs and targeting specific modules, there was just a lot more to have to consider.
---
But if you have nothing to upscale to and nothing to work towards it is not worth it.
---
Nah. People just wont rat in caps. Fuck caps anyways, remove them from the game.
---
I'm the best content creator of salt on this sub. Hands down.
---
This is r/eve, where reality is a myth and everyone thinks their idea is good.
---
This is revisionist history. Skill injectors were divisive from the second they were announced. People begged for the Rorq to be better than a POS boost for years. Null CSMs complained Citadels were underpowered for months before they were proven to be suitable. It's only in retrospect that "everyone" can see all this.
---
Who even are you?
---
You do realize that those nullsec blob fights you talk crap about are the reason people were drawn to this game.  May not be the reason they stay but it is the reason a lot of people  came and tried it out.
---
No, I understand completely. If up to 250 people are in a mode where they are trying to make money, you want them all to stop what they are doing, reorganize, and reship because YOU the unique special snowflake have decided it's time to pvp. Fuck what they are doing, fuck what they want, everybody stop and pvp now because "I" feel like it.
---
The answer is no, if you want to go into their space and pick a fight you get what you get and you will be treated like the annoyance you are, and should be treated so. Sorry to burst the bubble Barney built when he told you you were special. Your not.
---
Thanks, Jack. Thanks a lot. After all we've been through here together. *sigh*
---
Even if it was 1 cap/ship on a t1 cyno, you would just daisy chain your fleet in.
---
&gt;A. What's the best way to organize your drone groups. Is it good practice to mix lights and meds, or should I separate them by size and damage type?
---
There are certain situations where having a mixed group can be good. I remember having a vexor fit where we had 2 heavy, 2 medium, and a light as the DPS set. But that was an outlier. You almost always want to group like with like, and think about what drones you bring as you're fitting. Having sets of 5 is obviously good practice. I think my Strat fit has a set of heavies, sentries, one or two sets of mediums, and one set of lights with an additional set of EC300s
---
&gt;B. What are some of the different decloaking tactics? I know it depends on the situation for example when you attack from a perch you should probably decloak while warping to the tgt. Or in my case at what range is it best to decloak and where should I be relative to the target?
---
One tactic that I'm fond of is sneaking up on them, getting close, and decloaking/MWD on at the same time. The idea is to ram them and make aligning their ship nearly impossible for the duration of the decloak timer so I can then tackle. It's situational, but it can work. It's all just timing. What's your speed? How long till you're in range? How much attention are they paying?
---
&gt;C. What are some tips for recognizing fits (other than looking at guns/msls on the EN ship)? For example, if I'm neuting him and he keeps repping to me that says cap injected at which point I should probably want to keep track of how many times he reps (counting cap charges).
---
You can try to count cap injection, but I guarantee your attention will need to be elsewhere. This one, unfortunately, is just a matter of experience. Learn what it feels like when a target is outrepping you. You'll die during this learning process, so if a Stratios is too much to lose, consider learning on something cheaper. As for recognizing fits, zkill is good, but what's best is probably understanding when a fight is going to be close enough for it to matter. A ratting fit Vexor vs a well for Stratios is not going to be a close fight. Heavy drones of almost any kind may have been better than the mixed mediums you put out. 
---
&gt;D. What's the best way to operate your neuts? I know about cycling but how long do I keep it up, at what point do I switch to my small neut. I know there's a lot to consider and is situation dependent.
---
Operate your neuts as much as your own capacitor will allow. If it's me, once I notice my target is struggling to rep or do damage (based on weapon type) I'll turn off all but one small neut. They're probably capped out at that point.
---
Cynos on Hictors was retardo as fuck in the first place.
---
Are you able to dock supers in low sec and npc null stations?
---
My partner and I flew with this guy right before he left Bergmann for Shoots first. We debated going with him because he was so fun to fly with. I would never have pegged him as a thief.
---
Nice work! Time to keep at it!
---
Yes it is, when the smart people have business minded peoples hands around their necks.
---
Where is the ehp nerf?
---
Yes, it sounds like sci-fi. If only they were playing a sci-fi game.
---
wait...
---
Also restrict upwell structures from anchoring anywhere else than near listed celestials
---
You’re trying way too hard. How about this: dumbass. Seriously, quit my dude - you are painting yourself an absolute fool.
---
You sir, are a motherfucking genius.
---
Nope
---
Asset safety was the bigest tho. Imagine docked supers dropping when the keepstar dies(or if you had a pilot in them thet would remain logged off in space)
---
The thing is, PvE in capitals at all is kind of stupid.
---
So this:  
---
&gt;there will be no point.  
---
Is good.
---
Talked about my CCP rise
---
Download link went out an hour or two ago.
---
Matter of opinion. And no one said you couldn't rat in a super after the changes. Am I still working towards a super? Sure. Do I want it for ratting? Maybe not so much anymore. As Eve changes, my goals are changing as well. I still have a goal of eventually being self sufficient and not needing my wallet to stay Omega. I'll get there. Just takes time, and I just need to adjust how I get there.
---
News for you, ratting meta is going to be system level in standing fleet with fax &amp;recon on standby with similar safety.  
---
Timeline for cyno inhib anchoring will be more favorable for the hunters though.
---
So the FOBs can be infinitely spammed then instead?
---
Super capitals should not be able to dock.
---
That’s actually a really good point, unfortunately there’s 2 groups in the game who’s keepstars for all intents and purposes are invincible in the current political situation. Asset safety removal on keepstars would definitely be more of an advantage to them than smaller groups.
---
dunno man i think it was damage caps
---
ur obnoxious
---
Lol
---
Super docking, asset safety, and unchecked structure spamming... literally cancer.
---
I was reading your corps stuff last night. Interesting gig you guys got.
---
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
---
If 20 bombers can't kill something, then that's a problem.
---
This is still way too much spam.  4 meds, 2 large or 1 xl per system.  Moon mining exempt.
---
Flair baited? Or you mean V0lta?
---
I remember when XxXxXxdEAath XxXXxX or whoever lost space, and suddenly Lonetrek was full of Russian bot miners. It was funny to flip their cans and tractor them away with an MWD Noctis, and watch all their haulers slowly creep out of the asteroid belt chasing them. :)
---
This is Patrick
---
as it should, if you can't manage to kill/keep 100 newbie crucifiers off grid im not sure what you're doing holding the field with 50 titans. And honestly it wouldn't even be that hard of a counter, dds and bosons could give a fuck about tracking or optimal, and stacking penaltiels make it so that &gt;3 tds on a ship have practically no effect
---
Lol yeah man i havnt really pvp’d much in eve
---
Good.
---
Sites should have had acceleration gates preventing cap entry from the start.
---
(Would have made good strategy, too, to stage a fleet inside a site so caps can't be cyno'd on you).
---
Jesus not everything boils down to X vs FOTM
---
lmfao at KF being a "feeder corp"
---
Thank you for showing the community how ignorant you are.
---
why do you think i do?
---
It was great until 8:45 when the awful music starts :/
---
&gt;Rip carrier ratting
---
You aren't going to get changes that require a lot of coding.  We can sita nd mentally masturbate all we want but CCP is going to be either farmed with little effort put into making any changes or they will roll the dice on low-coding (but big game effect) changes that MIGHT make the game better.  
---
To say that they should get good at game design and make changes that will require lots of coding just isn't one of the choices.
---
Given those two scenarios, I would prefer higher-risk changes done quickly.  If (big IF) we are lucky they will also correct or adjust those changes quickly.
---
People ratted in subcaps for fucking ages before Carrier ratting became such a massive isk faucet as we know it today, so I see no reason why that wouldn't happen again. Well, keep happening actually, since it never stopped being a thing.
---
It's almost as if CCP considered that the ammount of isk/resources being generated by virtually safe Super/Carrier ratting and multiboxed Rorquals was a problem and decided to do something about it...
---
Yes, I'm literally crying, I can't control myself, I don't think I'll survive.... interacting with disgusting wastes of oxygen and water like you any longer.
---
I preferred assigning fighters to my tengu and leaving the carrier on station. Got to use tengu and had the fighters to reach out further than my hams could.
---
[deleted]
---
Actually, doing things SLOWLY is part of how we got here.  There have been complaints about injectors, citadels, caps, cynos, bots, etc for at least 3 years, if not more.  The longer it was allowed to go on the greater the damage has been.  We now have thousands, if not tens of thousands of players who think what goes on in Delve is "normal" for Eve and their given right.
---
I went trough all the settings and can't find an option for this. So this was a recent change?
---
That is probably one of the dumbest questions I have heard.  How is it relevant?
---
I'll have to give it a listen.
---
Careful, you'll queue the small-gang-elite-peeveepee-downvote-brigade.
---
Or CCP could add some kind of PvE content for caps...
---
It's funny, this guy joined us for two days and left because we didn't want to give him full control over our PvP ops.  
---
He wanted to take our guys out to defend a citadel of you guys (Shoot First) but I told him we don't want to pick sites yet as our alliance was and still is in an early state. No need to pick sides and make enemies.  
---
He got pissed and left. Now reading this it seems like even if he wanted to defend your citadel, he didn't do it out of loyalty I assume.
---
Fun part is, that he will fly a monitor in a munnin fleet...
---
They aren't. Not even close. Not unless you happen to have a super fleet on standby to save your ass every 30 minutes. - And with the upcoming cyno changes, that won't even be enough to make carrier/subcap ratting worth the time.
---
Supers might still be able to do it, because their ehp is high enough to survive long enough for the faux blob to get there.
---
But yea. We are rapidly heading towards a meta where it's either super ratting or no ratting at all.
---
No it wasnt, they should be able to dock and not have to coffin characters.  I always thought that was ridiculous gameplay.
---
Blackout killed it already. They shoukd have made carrier ratting more interesting, but instead they made it impossible.
---
Like L5 missions, the Blood Raider/Guristas Sotiyos, WH sites (can’t remember the names)...
---
I'm thinking about, say, bloc linemembers who go on vacation halfway through a war and miss the undeployment train home. They might be 5 mids out of their staging and have to abandon all their caps/ships instead of being able to move them - the simple cost of cynos (at 300m/recon) is higher than the cost of a cap. 
---
My own anecdote: I live in lowsec and routinely buy caps that come on sale within jumprange of my own staging, jump them to staging and fit them up for pvp. This is not something I could keep doing if cynos were 300m a pop, unless those caps were *very* cheap.
---
Asset safety is fine.  the amount you have to pay on a super to have it go to asset safety is no small sum.
---
damn should i go looking around zkill for a carrier that just died to 20 bombers?
---
I guess since Cercis is in a titan now that means his RMT is going well? That guy is not smart, but at least he has money!
---
Higher ticks? It takes something like 24 hours of carrier ratting in a carrier to break even now, and you stand zero chance if you are caught. It's a joke.
---
Skill injectors are fine.
---
Upscale your Myrms to 10 rattles or 15 domis 4head
---
lmao you fucking kiddos these days
---
They have battleship sized weapons, why does that not make sense
---
Upscaling from a ratting BS to a ratting carrier to a ratting super is something to "work towards"?
---
Is that supposed to be, like, an achievement?
---
Now this is bad!
---
Those are fit for active rep, so the buffer is low. I would have to look it up to see, but they probably have a pretty high alpha.
---
C5/c6 capital escalations
---
WTS titans cheap!!!
---
You're a young E4 or E5 aren't you?
---
Awesome! Love that instead of salty you took sweet revenge!
---
thats just how he is. if he thinks you're not worth his time he will just throw insults around.
---
The epitome of eve combat is hunting a single PvE ship with a giant fleet of invisible PvP ships and then thinking you're amazing when you kill it.
---
And make it impossible to tackle the stuff inside?
---
No thanks
---
Doesn't really affect the large alliances tbh. They control the plex market in Perimeter and have super umbrellas.
---
Prolly cuz one guy chasing them usually has a cyno fit.
---
&gt; wiki.eveuniversity.org
---
Hey, thanks!
---
Haha, thanks for posting! I love that CCP is actively ruining your playstyle!
---
So not a salty post.
---
\*eminently
---
Sounds like a casual, such a powerful tool should be locked behind a big gate
---
Guess game health doesn’t matter tho eh? So long as you can feel like you’ve got a big e-peen dropping a super on a small roaming gang
---
So how do you move your super with one account? For that matter why should anyone save you when you get caught krabbing with no fax?
---
No but it allows you to br able to make enough isk to actually do more than buy solo pvp and doctrine ships in the game and it made it worth it to live in nullsec.
---
I suggested a while ago to let titans orbit planets as a means of "parking" them to let the character do other things. The titan would be in space but invulnerable if a character isn't in it. But when you board it and warp away from your orbit spot, it would be business as usual... Tether on the Keepstar and be a bridge or be ready to jump.
---
Because back then a frigate was 46k isk
---
Good. Carrier ratting is dumb and needs to not be a thing.
---
Imagine docked supers dying when the KS dies...
---
I’m not in a corp of poors
---
&gt; Sounds like a casual 
---
And?  How dare someone want to play a vide casually.  lol.  That's not a bad thing.  It shouldnt be locked behind a big gate.
---
&gt; Guess game health doesn’t matter tho eh? So long as you can feel like  you’ve got a big e-peen dropping a super on a small roaming gang 
---
Game health does matter, but you're idea of going about it is not the correct way.
---
oh course the goon is in favor of it being mad easier and easier to sit in supers. it should be inconvenient or we get what we have now, which is objectively bad for the game.
---
Imagine if Keepstars had a cap on how many Supers or Titans could dock in them.  Also Keepstar owner would need to be able to force them into asset safety to free space up.
---
delicious tears
---
Is that 7m before or after compressing (or is it based on the refine value)? Even that seems a bit low..
---
We somehow managed with POSes, what's the problem with having that limit again, exactly?
---
What if they can dock, but you can asset safety only ships which can be docked to a station in lowsec? And there should be natural limit for structures, like moons in system for moon mining structures (don’t remember their name) and planets for engineer complexes and citadels. If that would happen together with cyno changes I don’t even mind if they would turn on local again.
---
CCP shouldn’t balance around casuals, maybe if you’re super casual you shouldn’t be getting into the most powerful ships in the game? Maybe if a casual can do that something isn’t right?
---
I think maybe I misread your post
---
... sorry my dude ♡
---
I will say though, and laugh if you must but, there have been changes (watchlist) that erased entire playstyles/career paths in other parts of space and most perspectives from Null were "adapt or die" and ever since Blackout it's been nothing but REEEEEEEEE from larger groups.
---
Maybe you're not that voice, but it's all around us.
---
Anyway, thanks for being chill and having a conversation +1
---
Get this guy on CSM. First good and decent idea I've read in a year.
---
Isn't the epitome of eve combat pushing F1 in full tidi?
---
\*gets popcorn
---
Carriers and Supers were supposed to be major military assets not isk printing machines.
---
i’m making 30-40m/hr invasions but idk if it’s trading only, i have met the requirements so far
---
What sort of engagements would you look for in a buffer shield neut strat vs a armor repping brawly strat? I love the ship but I don't really know how to use it appropriately
---
&gt; CCP shouldn’t balance around casuals
---
You're wrong.
---
&gt; maybe if you’re super casual you shouldn’t be getting into the most powerful ships in the game? Maybe if a casual can do that something isn’t right?
---
You're wrong again.  That's why being able to dock some supers somewhere is important.  I do not think whether someone someone is casual or not should prevent them from getting into those ships on principle.
---
Don't allow any caps to dock.
---
Remove all the caps that are currently docked.
---
Ban all the accounts that were ever using caps.
---
#CHAOSERA
---
The thing with balancing supers around asset safety is there’s 2 large groups in the game who’s keepstars are basically invincible, which would obvious be a relative buff to them
---
13% and the contents of Meinertzhagen's Haversack
---
&gt; yeah but why should a 20man gang kill a super without bringing in own capitals/dreads?
---
a gang of 20 heavy proper blingy battleships costs more than a supercarrier, is way more vulnerable and takes far more skill since you won't be singleboxing them due to the nature of catching supers, do you think they should not be able to just because there was no capital used?
---
also if you're paying attention, even with the blackout its almost impossible to get caught in a super ratting, and getting caught is just the start of the struggle to kill it
---
&gt; So instead for going for the targets they can kill via camps/roaming they want the big stuff kills which they shouldnt get
---
there are no other targets(and that's not because of blackout btw), do you guys think smallgang people kill vni's/myrms/domis for escalation because its fun? out in the field there are only those afk ratting drone boats, ratting carriers/supers and mining fleets that have literal incincibility for 6(?) minutes
---
I get you want to play FarmVille in space but people like you are ruining the game, please fuckoff to WoW or something
---
How is it not one? 
---
Upgrading from a T1 cruiser to a T3C is something to work towards.
---
Upgrading from a venture to an orca/rorq is something to work towards. 
---
I don't, like, understand your logic?
---
Some of us prefer to play on one account, not 10/15
---
We somehow managed with not fatigue and increased jump ranges too.
---
If we’re gonna live in the past with shitty mechanics let’s not just cherry pick the ones *you* like.
---
I like it! There were a couple of times where I accidentally trained skills halfway to V instead of just to IV.
---
What do you mean how do move it? I stay in my Corp/alliance and if we have a move op we do it together? If we move anywhere the alliance moves together?  Are you that daft? And they save me because they want content and because it’s fun to drop and save people? Because they don’t want the alliance to loose a super. Grow up kid. No game should force you to have multiple accounts to play other than just make it easier. Fuck off with that shit. Move my super? Cyno beacons and friends?
---
What matters is he knows Matterall. And if you do ask Materall he’ll say “can’t get more legit than legistics”
---
Hi, in Pandemic Horde you will content almost all the time, it's kinda crazy at times during peak hours where you have multiple fleets and small gangs roaming around.
---
This is apart from fleets being pinged by Horde FCs, you have all sorts, roamings, bombings, small gang, response fleets, strat ops and last but not the least, structure bashes which has a chance of content.
---
That's just PvP, you have PvE fleets pinged every hour during Eutz and UStz. AUtz is kinda what you expect it to be, bogans eating vegemites screaming 'cunts' and 'mates'.
---
Agreed, but CCP seemingly dont agree, so might aswell pitch something viable that isnt a personal wishlist request.
---
Isn’t that what every other blops group does ? Just replace wormhole with staging and there u go.. u could go with legions aswell or tengus
---
Sure, but the existence of very popular third party applications should be a sign that Eve desperately needs a feature.
---
That's your brain on themepark mmos.
---
you misspelled bombers
---
Yeahhh? I’m in favor of a game not forcing you to have multiple accounts in order to play. I should be able to do everything with one account. that said I have 3 but I should still be able to do everything with one. 
---
It should not be inconvenient are you that dumb and ignorant? If I had a super and then could just no longer use that character that’s just shitty game design you child. The new cyno changes I think are gonna be a neat new way to play the game. And no it’s not bad for the game to be able to dock supers. I can actually use that character for stuff other than being in a super. Dumbo.
---
This won’t last forever. But yeah smaller fish should be more careful with their supers, thats actually true even without that change.
---
rich idiots best idiots
---
&gt; Nobody wants to bother going carrier hunting with their own carrier
---
why the fuck would you ever hunt a carrier with another carrier, this just shows how much you know about caps honestly lmao
---
It was for Karma fleet :D
---
They want you to have to log in to the game. One of the reasons for not adding a skill queue for so many years was because they were concerned that people would stop logging in to the game. In short, just CCP things.
---
Imagine being so autistic to buy youreself Reddit awards lmfao
---
Great. Caps were a mistake from the start, but CCP won't remove them, the least they can do is make them a military asset that you have to risk in order to use.
---
I like that idea, though I wish they used starter missions/career agents to send them into other secs afterwards in a more directed manner. There is just a sudden "your done, now try stuff" place that I feel is a lost opportunity in Eve to push people out and into things.
---
When I started I read reddit and thought I HAD to make alts.. and make more bank before moving on. then I stumbled on FW and found that lower sec was so much fun, but I had all the wrong skills
---
yessss MORE KEEPSTARS
---
as their glorious leader?
---
While they are at, please make it possible to stack up several months of MCT.
---
Have you ever seen the average Eve players trying to FC ?
---
I wonder if this is what it looks like when a game goes through desperation near it's end; Is this all just the death throws?
---
Revolutionary idea friend
---
he is correct.      
---
When the subcap ratting was on its top, roaming ships did 350-450dps, sometimes even less
---
Those were cruisers and you roamed in like 10ppl max           
---
Now you have 200 bomber fleet and destroyers that are faster, more agile, have more EHP and dps than cruisers of the old days.        
---
PVE ship have no buffor in order to be pve capable , and when it gets tackled it dies - especially in todays new eden where a small gang can bring easily 5k+ of dps.
---
This. Remove one timer, and disable asset safety in nullsec, and you'll see them start popping.
---
Memeing is trying to draw attention to myself to make myself feel cool.  I'm trolling, which is quite the opposite.  The moment I have your attention you should feel dumb.
---
People in FW manage to tackle stuff inside plexes, so...
---
Not bad at all. Good on u.
---
Apparently it's you that feel like you deserve some attention every time you come to see people.
---
People don't care about you, if you bother them they'll choose how they will make you go away. Why should YOU choose for them ?
---
You do know that high class wormholes don't have static k-space connections, right? The people you're mad at who roll, roam, roll, roam mostly live in C2 wormholes.
---
Who ganked you?
---
How about removing asset safety entirely, as it is dumb and doesn't fit with the rest of EVE in any way?
---
I don't have my own set of BPO, it was a choice of significantly reduced working capital, or set of some of the BPOs.
---
When I do buy them, I buy from Jita. I sort price down, and scroll until I find 40run copies at max research. I then quite often search for that supplier and buy rest of bpcs from them to avoid scams/poor quality/overpricing
---
the battleships do need love
---
But to the rest of your reeee delete subcaps so they can’t cry about caps
---
This pond is full of fish that never stop biting.  Tell me more about how retarded I am about getting mad over something and then posting on reddit.  
---
Your the pot calling the kettle black.  At least I knew what I was doing was retarded from the on set.  You're just not that bright
---
People ratted in subcaps for ages before WH's and mass capitals started shitting out isk and spiking inflation. Subcap ratting for raw isk rewards and no commodities is going to suck.
---
And how do you handle having your own caps get on grid then ? Cloak doesn't last indefinitely, and defenders are usually not retarded enough to not know reaaaally quickly where you are.
---
And don't forget that TIDI plays in their favor in this specific scenario.
---
You won't, ever, get supers on the grid of a contested structure this way.
---
Shhhh you will ruin their narrative that citadels don't drop loot and thus are not worth shooting.
---
They’re even worse than summer children. They just expect everything to be easy mode handed to them. Imagine them trying to play EVE in 2009? Literally only good for F1.
---
I hope you're not actually in goons, because I never want to deal with you.
---
because there needs to be a chance to actually suceed, if just losing ships mindlessly with no sucess chance(and the knowledge of said lack of chance) was fun i'd just undock shuttles in a wardecced toon in jita, 120 dreads won't do much against a super drop, unless the super fucks up in some very absurd ways. supers aren't special anymore and you ain't bleeding anyone by killing them.
---
also can we talk about how a 30 man nano gang is gonna somehow form 120 dreads?
---
not gonna argue with that
---
Ya Stratios is a pretty solid hunting ship. Good Job securing the kill! 
---
&gt; I had no clue what drones to throw at him. 
---
Most standards fits for strat are the afterburner with webs and neuts so your fit generally. They use the full 100 bandwidth to launch 4 heavy drones to get more DPS as getting a scram plus one or 2 web will let the heavies apply to your target. 3 Heavies and 2 Medium drones (same damage type) are arguably better tracking for same damage but either is fine. Full sets of medium or small drones (same damage type) are good to have for various situation or smaller ships. 
---
&gt; What are some tips for recognizing fits? 
---
Yes looking at zkillboard can give a better idea of what type of pilot he is and his past fits. don't be too worried about if they are more "dangerous" it's not the full story. I've killed good PvP'ers in the same situation: strat vs vexor.
---
Lots of null fits are shield to maximize DPS for ratting. You should have noticed that he was only going 300m/s so maybe doesn't have a propulsion mod at all. If you watched his ship for a min you should of seen the effect of the adaptive invul which would have been a tale-tale sign that hes shield fit. 
---
&gt; What are some of the different decloaking tactics 
---
Pretty much what you did, try to be close so you can bump or be right on him if possible for decloak. Some things to try to do is work on overheating your modules. You can even do it before you cloak up if you practice. If he was faster it might have been a close call to catch him. Thermodynamics skill helps your overheating. Approach and decloak when you bump them or in your case approach delcoak AB on and lock him. Try to have overheated webs and scram to grab him a little further out. You can OH the AB as well but it will make your midslots crispy so some caution is advised as you get used to it.   
---
&gt; What's the best way to operate your neuts? 
---
Want to have a Medium neut on right away then cycle the other neut on to stagger neuts, hopefully its another medium. If you have a small neut or nos as well put that shit one! Strat does pretty good DPS and a big buffer tank (most times) but it relies on the neuts to shut down the other ship in a timely fashion. Neut as much and as long as you can depending on skills and fit.    
---
As for what targets to engage is sorta up in the air. Things like Galente or Amarr that often use guns that take cap are good targets. Same with active tanks. Some fit tracking disruption over a second web to further help you win a battle. Try to learn what type of tank and weapons a ship use. You can look at ship info from D-scan. Look at how many mid and low slots and the resists to best prepare what drones might be the best. You can have 2 sets of high DPS drones which gives you 2 types of damage. 
---
Good luck hunting o7
---
sshhh
---
Yes, this is exactly what it looks like with CCP throwing spaghetti against the wall in a last-ditch desperate attempt to hope something sticks. There's a reason why 70% of the players in this game stay in high-sec.
---
You still have many options: interceptors, dictors, Sabre’s, or just ships fit with tackle.
---
Oh god, no, you'd have to have support for your fleet of expensive ships? Literally unplayable.
---
I would pair it with some sort of limit per system.
---
I jave a feeling like bombers are next on the nerf bat.
---
The meta will shift. I still remember the endless blobs of drakes back in the day. Heck i even remember ravens online. Things will adapt
---
Those fights were happening before capitals could dock, so this comment is utterly irrelevant to de discussion. 
---
Try again.
---
Listen, AP has been in at least 2 fleet fights.
---
He's a really good TQ pilot.
---
And there we are : Do you truly think 99.99% of people ratting in space want your "pvp opportunity" ? They don't. So yes, you're throwing a middle finger to them, simple as that.
---
Eve is also a PvP game, so you're well within your rights to try to kill them any time you want, but they also are well within their to bring superheavy assets to deter you.
---
Why the fuck people are not getting by "We don't want you here so we won't give you what you want" ?
---
 [http://i.imgur.com/xOMYf1L.png0](http://i.imgur.com/xOMYf1L.png0) &lt; rat damage

Drone rats do Explosive and its the highest resits for shield fits as well :p
---
Unpopular Opinion: Citadels and supers are a fun part of the game.
---
Come join me. I hang out in theta every day. I have 4 accounts and I do move my own shit with alts man lol. I’m just saying people shouldn’t be forced to have cyno Alts and other characters and shit. But if you don’t wanna deal with me Then don’t. I make friends with people I play with who offer to help with shit.  It’s a corp/alliance for a reason too man.
---
The Strat's engagement profile depends pretty heavily on what prop mod you're working with. With an oversized afterburner for example, you can kinda engage anything because you can disengage almost whenever you want. 
---
Just based on your formulation though... The neut strat will do well against heavily cap dependent ships (ones that rep, use lasers, etc.). The armor strat will struggle against reinforcements, so make sure you have an exit strategy
---
...You do know there's already no asset safety in wormholes, right? If you want to evict someone for their stuff you can do it _right now_. You just have to put in the small amount of effort to find a target. Literally the only thing OP complains about is the content not being handed on a plate for zero effort.
---
&gt; There should also be some mechanic in place to prevent massive numbers of them from being built and stockpiled to instantly replace losses
---
The removal of asset safety in citadels would accomplish that.
---
I'm a WHer so sure we enjoy no asset safety.  Should be in conjunction with other things.
---
They wanna increase the use of sub caps in war. Then a Wh creation module would be an awesome idea. Sadly they would need to do something with cloaks other wise you would just have spams of bombers coming through Wh.
---
Remove asset safety completely. If a station where to be destroyed irl then your stuff would also be gone. If there was no asset safety there would be more war. Example you know a certain station houses tone super caps and titans. That know has a huge target on its back. If you where offline when it's destroyed I feel sorry for you but what's done is done. You could horde your stuff in npc Station if you where leaving for awhile.
---
Cyno changes are a disaster all round. No need for it. Cyno is over powered due to nul blocs using it to its maximum potential. Wh/low sec gangs need to grow up you wanna kill billion isk ships with ships worth 50 mil then go get the numbers dont cry when the empires use there full force against you.
---
My own preference on changes is there needs to be something done to shake things up ccp did an awful job of it. They just nerfed carrier ratting and botting for a short while (they'll figure a work around).. An created the age of the cloak.
---
1. I would have split the universe up have certain things minerals/resources only available in certain spaces. Or limited.
---
2. Instead nerfing ships increase the amount and type. Make more t2 versions or t3 versions. Wanna marauder to be able to fight a dread make a t3 version.
---
3. Wanna isk sink have eve make there own casino in space. You can Dock up in. To decentralise jita make these in amarr, dodixie and rens/hek.. Bring trade back to these areas.
---
4. Change the war mechanic from the engineer/refinery citadel. Simple miners in hi sec get enough grief.
---
5. This will be hated but ultimate shake up. Limit alliances to 2500 characters. This will force a level of cooperation never before seen. Also allow smaller alliances the chance to grow. And add a new feature called coalition so they can be blue. It will increase the need for leaders to step up also limiting Intel as alliance channel will now be split up. Forcing more interaction to make nul blocs work.
---
just have it be "flare" ammo, wich you can get a bpo for
---
its just bright and very slowly travels to the locked target (taking a few minutes)
---
Rolling back on this now would probably cause these large alliances to go suicide watch.
---
Money is not a balancing factor, as we can see with capital proliferation. The fact that something is expensive doesn't meak it's not broken.
---
So they are risk averse. Should I instead engage in just a pod?  The so called elite PvPers are nothing more than baby seal clubbers.
---
No, don't kill them. Drop them. That would be an AMAZING incentive to attack people.
---
This argument is bullshit. 
---
Every change will be taken advantage of by the biggest groups, because there is nothing you can do that can't be minmaxed better with greater numbers and better logistics. 
---
I'm all for removing docking, but the fact that there's people capable of defening their citadels doesn't mean asset safety is not a pants on head mechanic.
---
Money CAN be a balancing factor if its done right so I disagree.  Asset Safety is NOT broken.
---
yes buts its aids because even a max warpspeed HG ascendancy stilletto will not catch someone whos actually at keyboard and watching dscan   since the gates add easy 3-8 seconds delay from appearing on dscan and actually landing inside
---
Oh, here we go "The changes that were good to nullsec were fine to you, but not when it's the other way around uh ?". Your statement is incorrect, but for the sake of the argument, why shouldn't people be happy of buffs and angry about nerfs ? That's sadly how it works.
---
I never told you to bring dread to kill a subcap, I told you to bring dread to kill the response supercapitals if that's a bother to you. But you won't, because you want free, easy targets so you can call that pvp. There's a reason why we call that "ganking".
---
You're coming to a mega-alliance home turf to "seek content", but sadly they don't want to be content to you, so they organize themselves so you won't get any chance nor fun on their territory. Why then should you be able to still disrupt their operations if you don't ever want to put even half the effort ? You don't deserve kills, you have to earn them.
---
wow noone ever did that before !
---
Lol, apparently I play farmville in space.  No Im not ruining the game, im trying to introduce proper balance.  It is you who should fuck off to WoW just simply because it seems more your level.
---
1. The basic move for using cloaks against gate camps is the [cloak trick] (https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_trick).
---
2. Freighters are not really capital ships, in as much as they lack jump drives and don't require the Capital Ships skill.
---
I'd be content if the added the ability to fit a cyno to HICs. It is dedicated tackle ship, so it would make sense. Also, it can't receive remote reps while doing its thing so there is a real chance of popping it.
---
Damn, thats some entitlement there. Omg it only takes 24 hours of ratting formone charscter to earn enoough for a CAPITAL SHIP...
---
I'm npt a fan of the blackout or any proposed carrier nerfs, but more posts like that will chanve my mind.
---
It's in the August patch notes, I'm pretty sure.
---
It's not a setting, it's a choice on the context menu where you right click after selecting some text. Supposedly.
---
I wonder is it just due to much less Russians+Eastern Euros playing eve these days? Higher standards of living, so they can afford better computers now and by extension games with higher system requirements? Can't help thinking eve had such a high population of russian speakers back in the day mainly because it used to be one of few games any potatoe pc could run. I know a lot of high profile FC's stopped playing but sure every alliance has that and many still survive or evolve.
---
Im sorry ive literally never heard of you. Who are you and what do you do?
---
Tried logging in but it says invalid token, guess it's still too early.
---
Pretty new, and I occasionally glance at that chart for inspiration. Would you mind elaborating for my benefit in case I’ve been mislead already?
---
He has a point and you don't get it : Why is that when you're ganking a ship 8 to 1, maybe with more powerful/expensives ships, it's fair game, but when they do the same it isn't ?
---
Don't get me started about "but we're small gangs :( :( ", anything you can do, bigger groups can abuse. Maybe you got 8 frigates, but then you have INIT cyno'ing 200 bombers. Defensive tools like supers are used exactly for that, too bad you're a collateral damage.
---
If you come somewhere to gank people, you don't have any right to complain about the defensive response. That's exactly the answer to your "but non consensual pvp 1§!!1§1" : It goes both ways.
---
I would have guessed O1/O2 -- curious why you are thinking enlisted.
---
SP loss as a penalty has always been a pretty silly mechanic.  The loss of an expensive ship/pod is usually enough to make you care about when/if you use that specific ship.  I would like to see SP loss go away from T3C.  
---
For Titans it would be even more silly and punitive.  When you lose your Titans or super and it’s pod  you already know a ‘bad’ thing happened.  It’s going to cost the owner (or the Corp) real ISK to replace.  
---
To lose Titan V on top of that just seems unnecessary.   Big groups that SRP Titans and supers would probably just SRP injectors to reclaim the lost SPs.  Only one that would be hurt would be people and corps that do not have deep pockets but have the guts to undock nice things.
---
\&gt;:D Keep asset safety but all supers drop when a structure gets destroyed
---
And how would it be "done right"? Asset safety makes it so that there is no incentive to attack Citadels in nullsec, save from meta grievances. 
---
If you could not defend the box where your toys are, why should you be able to keep the toys? it doesn't matter how much you pay for it, the loot should go to the people who killed your citadel, just like EVERYTHING ELSE in this game.
---
Loki's will be the new scouting ship.
---
You mean your real name isn't StainGuy? That's why you haven't got that lowsec gate yet, you haven't committed. Gotta go legally change your name to show CCP how serious you are.
---
Yep, there you go, happy hunting
---
Congratulations on the solo kill.
---
Same thing last time, tokens only active when it starts
---
Controls posted in Discord have no fire button, only a "Harvest Resources" button lol. Welcome to MMO = Massively Mining Online lol
---
Honestly CCP shouldn't try to remove carrier/super ratting. Hunting them generates a lot of content and juicy killmails. 
---
The real problem is super umbrellas. I really don't get why they haven't nerfed capital application to the ground in the last balance patch. Carriers and HAW dreads should apply negligible damage to anything smaller than a BS.
---
The tooltip will also appear under the cap.
---
Lmao, you’re so fucked in the head I’m surprised you managed to download the client to start with.
---
Biomass you’d make this game better.
---
wtf is this tho
---
That’s not what I said, I said that it isn’t a good way to balance supers, not that asset safety is good.
---
It still works, it does take long though : that's the point. Also Delve is not the perfect example : They have way more people that anyone else.
---
You don't have the possibility to choose the defensive response, and to force people to form subcaps to fight you, and luckily, it's all normal : Why should 10 people be able to vs 10000 ?
---
Good 😬
---
Christ dude, save some lokis for the rest of us
---
Right?
---
You're never going to survive 24 hours of ratting in a carrier. I'm saying that it makes no economic sense to carrier rat any more. It's dead.
---
No, Asset Safety is a good mechanic.
---
Disallowing docking was a blatant admission that this is the game of alts. Out of all things changed back then, this one was okay.
---
...what?
---
How is that first situation anything remotely like what we are talking about?
---
Like...that's the worst case of misrepresentation I've ever seen.
---
Biomass. Its the only way
---
We can talk about that.
---
If you are willing to talk about *why* a 30 man nanogang would go to a supercapital proliferated area for "content" that somehow doesnt involve those
---
\*laughs in krab\*  After I've finished smoking this  cigar and can stop laughing call me.
---
If they cant escalate, if theyre too small, and if they dont want to fight at a disadvantage...
---
Why the living fuck are they going to the most upgraded space?
---
nou
---
That sounds like a problem that the hunters REALLY should consider before using the tactics of "muhtrigs and muhfrigs"
---
Asset safety removal would be cheered by most Goons and probably Test.   
---
I would expect within a couple of weeks the current major powers would have most major KS in ref and 1000s of greedy nerds ready to grind down any structure that seemed likely to have anything of value.  Everyone eager to exchange Titans with any group that wants to.  
---
Our members that complained about our recent war against the ‘north’s’ structures will be alarm clocking for the chance to loot then.  
---
This would be the best way to clear the clutter of structures in space and maybe trim down the Titan numbers a bit.
---
That would suck ass. No one would use heavy bombers if they where battlecrusiers
---
Honestly, if people from null acted as assholes then they deserve bad shit as well. I dont condone people being cunts. But I do know that alot of the moderate voices have been against many of the things we have seen. And it feels like they are fked aswell with this but like we can adapt right. Its not that singular changes will break us in that sense but things need to change in a thought out way. Dont see how these changes will actually serve their purpose.
---
You too man!
---
forcing people to have alts is not a good mechanic in my opinion, it wasnt 10 years ago and its still not today.
---
indeed so why are you talking about real life ?
---
Of course I just got CovOps 5 trained, haha. But ya, there's a reason bombers are consistently at the top of the killboards.
---
So the carrier ratting I did last.night while having my alt.in a Caracals in the defense fleet didnt happen? 
---
Damn, I need to lay off the corona then. Because I could swore I ratted last night for several.hpurs and got 2 10/10s that I sold.
---
that's what should happen. also, not a popular opinion on this sub, but asset safety doesn't belong outside sovnull. it should be a mechanic tied to sovereignty, just like player outposts were. one structure per system, requires sov to activate it. needs to be destroyed to deactivate it (cant be unanchored).
---
Citadels are obviously not POSs. Let's look at the issue about structure spam. In friendly territorry you can get save in every system. The structures are even used as gate perches where you can tether. That gives a big advantage to the person living in that space versus a person roaming through.
---
I started to play after citadels were introduced so I'm not super familiar how POSs were used before that. I know some of the mechanics though. I doubt that let's say an INIT member would get save in a random delve system owned by goons in a goons pos as he wouldn't have it bookmarked in advance. In his home system he certainly has all the POS bookmarks though. It doesn't really matter if you talk about Imperium, Panfam, Legacy, Winteco, or GotG though. If the game would have had an outpost per sov system it would not have been healthy for the game either imho.
---
Highsec vs Nullsec: The issue for nullsec is that the structure spam increases the safety of the space and thus changes the balancing of that type of space. While in highsec the balancing is barely affected by more structures.
---
Yes, yes it is.
---
\^_^
---
Why bitch about the music? It's his taste not yours.
---
bootcamp
---
Application bonuses HAMs can blap frigates with some paints. Bombers are supposed to vulnerable to other frigates.
---
Great argument there buddy. 
---
How about this counter argumen: 
---
No, it isn't.
---
You heard it here first folks. You need to have a super to play the game apparently.
---
If that ever happens, you can remove them from the game, they serve no other purpose than that and bashing Keepstars.
---
Why is that ?
---
As long as we dont get sent back to the pound im good. Yes much pets
---
Once bombers are gone will probably see Kiki gangs. They do like 700dps, so basically the same as a bomber, but with way less SP required
---
I've never met a junior officer that ever talks or writes like that outside of work, probably because they have to put up with it so much at work.
---
Also probably because it would get them laughed out of the room haha.
---
I've met plenty of ambitious young enlisted dudes that do.  
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised either way. 
---
The only thing that would surprise me is if he's either a warrant or not in the military at all, which is nearly the same thing anyways haha.
---
I like how you think you get downvoted because you disagree with someone and not because your ideas are pure unadulterated garbage. It's cute.
---
Yup. It’s a real shame, but I love CCP nonetheless.
---
hmm indeed will need adjusitng. maybe take away the explosion velocity bonus. this could be mean but maybe move the cloak bonus to a skill level bonus so 20% reduction in targeting time penalty for cloaks per level... so at V its no delay
---
My one regret is we cannot up vote more than once
---
Strongly agree!  They should also be a rear echelon support vessel, not the sole source of DPS and spammed in fleets.
---
Im not arguing against that. That is in fact a very legitimate concern. And I honestly dont know what to do about it. Im simply pointing out that without the ability to hardcyno drops will become harder, be it defensive or offensive. The offensive aspect will become far harder in fact since that drop will take place against multiple hundreds, perhaps thousands on the other side. Even hardcynos die in those environments let alone a recon version. 
---
I.e., the cost of dropping caps in general just went up and that will make FCs rethink about even deploying them at all. And without them its pretty much impossible to actually do long term sov warfare because the defensive side will have them but the offensive wont. I belive this will cause further stagnation.
---
I really want to learn more about them and the Talocan. They both sound so *fascinating!*
---
"forced to do this to play" uhhhhhhhh nah. forced to have multiple accounts IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF GAMEPLAY. what are supers actually required for, on an individual player level? nothing. they are only required if you are in the nullsec empire building playstyle, so yes, some inconvenience should be expected, harden the fuck up if thats what you set your goal as.
---
Somehow, I doubt that's the case, the ammount of people actually going trough with unsubbing is likely not that big. 
---
Besides, subs are not the only source of income for EVE.
---
Pretty much this.  Time zone tanking and 3 timers, damage cap and no loot are the reasons why we have so many structures.  They are not fun to kill and easier to just go around.  
---
Just make them easier to kill or more ‘worthwhile’ to kill (or both).   Destruction will follow very naturally from that and numbers will decrease. 
---
No need for convulsed mechanics or inflexible total numbers in a system. Just make it enjoyable to actually blow them up.  
---
But be careful what you wish for though.  Get rid of asset safety +/- changes in TZ tanking/timers and you will have two very large blocks dividing up the map and steamrolling every structure they can get their hands on with members lining up to loot the corpse and every group that can undocking their big assets and hanging out in NPC stations.  Pretty much the reason they started asset safety to prevent.
---
Good
---
So?
---
Mine hangs too, but wait it out, it will eventually get unstuck. Of course, now there’s other issues preventing the ship from going anywhere, even if you’re at full speed. Status says please wait while we fix things.

---
 The agility of SB allows them to effectively keep up with CMDs and boosh, id be very careful messing with the hull size. 
---
Instead of a direct nerf splitting the roles between different hulls is defiantly the way forward. Also while we are talking about bomber changes, can we get an adjustable fuse? so you can set it to detonate in whatever range between 15-50km.
---
meaningfully terrible to fleet engagements. Have you heard the stories of carriers and supers on keepstars engaging subcap fleets solo?
---
Have you seen haw titans and dreads kill roaming frig/destroyer gangs?  
---
I have. I see the tears of the people getting killed, and chuckle at ccp's foolishness.
---
Kiki gangs? sorry not up to date with the jargon.
---
But isn't that because of inflation though? As more money is printed then the rate of inflation rises?
---
I love bomber ratting
---
&gt; The structures are even used as gate perches where you can tether. 
---
If they had to be anchored around celestial (i.e. moons), then that would only be possible at those specific celestials that also have a gate.
---
&gt; I doubt that let's say an INIT member would get save in a random delve system owned by goons in a goons pos as he wouldn't have it bookmarked in advance.
---
POS'es have passwords, if you know the password you can get inside the force field, if you are in the same corp as the POS you do not need the password. Corps/alliances/coalitions used to share passwords. Any ship fits inside a POS, including Titans (tight squeeze on a small though). One of the biggest benefits of using POS'es over citadels is that you could set them to auto-attack anyone who isn't blue, so you don't need a gunner to have a deadly POS, with a gunner a POS can take down a fairly sizable fleet if set up correctly. 
---
Several super ratters use POS'es still to this day, since they provide specific benefits over citadels (no need for any tether mechanics, get inside the shields and you're safe, even if fighters are out).
---
&gt; If the game would have had an outpost per sov system it would not have been healthy for the game either imho.
---
The game **had** 1 outpost per sov system until they removed the outposts. Some of the best years of the game were during the time these outposts were there.
---
\+1
---
that would be cool but make it a separate bomb... like a tech II one or something where you can set proximity detonation range.
---
Best memory was fighting a 50 man sheckel fleet in wormhole with my Tengu and tanking 450k damage
---
No. Only capitals can have trade offs for usage
---
7m geusstimate before compression; 100% yield with t2 drones and t2 drone mining rigs is somewhere around 8.5m/mined if mining veldspar and plagioclase (top highsec ores in value) if you were to assume the drones are mining 100% of the time. Accounting for some loss due to rocks running out and not switching to a different target (i mean, you are AFK) as well as drones having to stop mining, travel, and return, i go with around 7m.
---
Granted, it could be increased a bit if you go for the +5% / +10% variants but then if things are spread out and end up having to mine some scordite and/or have far longer drone travel times then it's going to plummet as well. In general, the value of ore in HS belts and the fairly small size of all the rocks just doesn't really allow AFKing it to be very useful.
---
In Tama of all places too.. One of the "better" spots to hang out for dank killz
---
Get enough bombs and instaclear waves
---
If it could cover cloak maybe people would. But it would be slow not very tanky and probably not be worth using to kill caps
---
Kikimora new Triglavian Destroyer.
---
I have no idea what's happening. I think I blew up some ships but my mineral count stayed at zero.
---
for those of us newer than that change, can you give a little more detail on what exactly the change was and how it influenced the game? thanks
---
Yes! And remove asset recovery from nullsec!
---
As someone that can't be bothered to dig up the specific patch notes and read the changes that happened, would you mind actually bringing up (preferably linking to) the specifics on what and how much changed? :P

It's not built because it's too retardedly expensive, it requires several thousand PI toons running for a year to get the materials for it. It costs roughly the same in materials as ALL citadels currently in New Eden, the effort to build all of them in one structure.
---
Sorry for the noob question, but I see titans for sale on contract in low sec stations.   How did those get there?
---
A sub ten man gang is not a proper fleet. The solo/smallgang meta is completely different from the larger fleet meta, and while the VNI will be decent for that it’s going to be pretty terrible in larger fleets.
---
If u are a moron and you dps tank your carrier and you get damnation level ehp yes you should evaporate
---
Asset safety from keepstars in both null &amp; lowsec, there used to be a keep in maila even (lowsec)
---
Come on man, you play Eve. Just make another account.
---
Sage nullbear threads
---
Ignore nullbear posts
---
Disregard nullbear slide threads
---
20*50m is 1bil which is roughly the cost of a carrier hull so I don't see why there is no reason for them to be able to kill one. If it was like 5 bombers I'd see your point
---
which is why everyone would immediately come together to shoot it
---
Chinese quality LULW
---
The point is nobody wants even engagements, not that a carrier is optimal.
---
How the fuck did you miss that?? 
---
Obviously bombers/t3C's/dread drops are optimal, but that has nothing to do with my point.
---
Nothing in this entire discussion has even referenced small gang wanting or trying to kill your rorquals or supers.
---
Your suggestion about wanting to be able to retaliate against wormholes with supers is exactly what this discussion is trying to prevent. Clearly you don’t understand wormholes in the slightest, because camping in a home wormhole system would not disrupt their pve at all, except for the fact that now you have 100 supers evicting you from your home. No asset safety dude.
---
Doubt it. Way too expensive still to be used in the place of a bomber. We yolo bombers around all over the place but not a chance we'd throw kikis into the same situations.
---
Oh please do. Love those ded sites where I can't get hotdropped and sit 100 km off the warpin in a mjd BS. I'll laugh at those force recons trying to get me while I spam my dscan for any hostiles getting decloaked by the accel gate. Combat probes pfff "activates cloak in deep save spot while going afk or do stuff on his alt"
---
I signed up and never got an email about it.
---
I never said I get to choose. I’ve been suggesting devs limit how easily you get to throw caps at everything.
---
Laughs in MJD's
---
Remember - this is a tech demo intended to show off backend, not frontend or netcode. But it is being presented to us, who are interested in frontend and netcode.
---
Ah, gotcha. :)
---
The game did wasn't even close to one outpost per system but had a hard limit to one outpost per system. Of course that limit was slowly approached. My statement was if that would have been hit then it would have been bad too.
---
I know the mechanics of POS. But are you saying you would have known the password to a random POS in a random system in delve? I doubt so.
---
In general too many people have nostalgia how eve was back in the day. Please think where it should move instead what was great back then. Mostly the changes to eve are two steps forward one step back. Most mechanics people seem to like back then sound rather broken and it's good that they are gone. I hope POSs are removed soon too. Would have been a better hit against botters than removing local.
---
I'm in, but can't find anyone to fight, nor how to harvest things.
---
What's wrong with multiboxing two super carriers? It requires more concentration and focus than most things in this game
---
I have plenty of accounts, I'm not going to log into them all on mobile to upvote.
---
&gt;get out with 0 risk at all.
---
I agree with this part
---
They nerfed the frequency with which wormholes to null sec spawned. They also lowered the lifespan to ~16 hours from 24 hours.
---
We are now just down to you saying “It can’t possibly work no matter what” There’s not much more for me to say to be honest.
---
It’s almost like this is a test? And it’s ok if things go wrong..?
---
If you’re flying boosh kikis you’re never really in any danger of whelping a fleet, disengaging with them is extremely easy.
---
I'm able to login, but it's basically just a slideshow for me.  I'm maybe running at 1 FPS, if I'm lucky.  I can't really even tell what my ship is doing, other than tumbling randomly around space every time I touch any of the controls.  Granted, my computer is hardly a bleeding edge gaming rig, but feels like I'm trying to run Crysis on a Commodore 64.
---
Smokey bbq thanks.
---
So 1 and 2 are avoided just by jumping in a few fax not with cyno fit, then fitting cyno after landing. 4 does nothing, you just bring another friend/alt/use a dictor if you're tackling. people already use stuff like lachs just for holding the target and a cyno tengu or stuff. 3.....is just a 'let me use t1 bcs and bs to cyno' vs what ccp did and doesn't make sense. 5 seems mostly pointless. so you combine them all, you've got BCs and BS that can cyno, so ships without a cloak, nullification, any sort of meaningful tank depending on how much you increase fitting requirements. 
---
why not just leave it as is? you're trying to do the same thing as ccp to be changes except completely neuter any attempt at using already paper thin recons to hunt things with, just so you can use a cheap t1 hull for it? nope.
---
The thing is, even the backend is crap. It's unstable, you have players spawning in the middle of nowhere with 0hp and massive amounts of lag, just to name a few of the issues.
---
Tidi is better than this.
---
We will see. I bet on -10-20% reduction in sub numbers in 3 month period. Depends if they are going to hold it up, or wherever they are going to change other aspects of the game.
---
This change made it less common for you to suddenly have next door neighbors in Insmother when you lived in Fountain. 
---
It made it more work to go roaming in far away parts of null sec.
---
It made null sec significantly more predictable and much safer for PVE.
---
It also removed some interesting logistic things people were doing.
---
There's a certain minimum expectation of functionality, though.
---
If things in-game go wrong, if the lag is horrible and the stability is atrocious, that's fair enough. It is just a test.
---
If people can't even log in because they aren't getting the client token, or because their computer is missing some obscure dll, or even for no reason at all, that's unacceptable.
---
28k logged in on a sunday eu primetime :thinking:
---
I love a response fleet, when did I say I didn't like when they bring a lot of dudes? I welcome whatever subcap you want to fly to come after me, and bring as many as you want. I might have to run or kite but I can still poke and have a chance of getting killed myself. All fun. Some even drop carriers and dreads and you can sometimes out play those but when a super, or multiple faxes and supers drop, that shit is what I'm complaining about. Nothing about 8 to 1 is fair, but the goal is to draw out your combat force to have some good fights. I'd happily be outnumbered 5:1 with subcaps but the cyno needed a change, and look at that, we got it :)
---
If subs go down, but unique people playing the game go up, that is good for the long term.
---
Lol nearly the whole of the last war was fought in AUTZ.. Fuckers timed it to us cause they thought it was our weak TZ.. They didn't predict the litres of redbull I  would consum daily.
---
Sabres rorqs and cynos are the best content generators
---
I have been REEEEing about this change since it was implemented. I poked Olmeca about it and he's added it to his "shit that needs fixing" spreadsheet. One can only hope.
---
Actually my dude, he told us the Bergmann alliance was his. I'm sorry he caused you trouble over our structure.
---
100% fine if it all fails but just don't go promising skins to people when they can't even get in to claim them.
---
Now they either need to send a skin to anyone who signed up or do something else to make it up to the people who took the time to fuck around trying to log in.
---
We experiment with a new format and discuss changes to cyno mechanics before taking an in depth look at communication in small gang.
---
 
---
This episode is sponsored by THE AESIR. They are a c2/null c5 corp that recently returned to EVE. With a Tight core of players going back 9 years they are offering great smallgang opportunity. If you have an interest in small gang and a bit of experience with small scale pvp, The Aesir wants you. Join “THOR pub” channel in game to get in touch.
---
I dont think he does RMT, but sounds like you dont like him.
---
It's brand new tech that is being stress tested. The expectation is for it to blow up. You need to get off your high horse.
---
[removed]
---
Yes pls fix
---
This is so well thought out. It’s immediately obvious why they didn’t do it this way.
---
Just CCP things.
---
And bitter :)
---
Again, minimum expectation of functionality.
---
The game server is being stress-tested. The client and the email server are not.
---
Shm caps and empires are what I started playing again for.
---
The Strat is a wonderful ship and everyone had already given lots of good advice.  
---
Timing the bump, web, tackle, drones and neuts and management of your cap takes a bit of practice.  When you first start flying them it seems that you have a lot of things to pay attention to, but it gets easier with time.  
---
As others have said, always have an exit strategy.  Usually that if friends show up to play with you.  :-)
---
Also don’t be afraid to practice with the Astero, as it kind of feels close to the Strat, but with less things going on but a smaller engagement profile.  It hurts less when you screw up with it as well.  
---
Have fun!
---
He did know his stuff
---
Group consensus? nah man, free fire until the jag shows up. death to jags.
---
How long do you have to play this garbage to get the skins?
---
Thank you!
---
the epitome of eve is being able to convince everybody to log on and push F1 when you tell them to.
---
Which is lower than it was 3 months ago, which was lower than 6 months ago...
---
Thanks
---
pvp in capitals is also kinda of stupid.  CCP has no idea what to do with capitals.
---
All I'm hearing from you is one thing. "If you want to fight us you have to bring caps or we'll call you gankers" Sorry, friend, but you can't whine about me coming to "your space" with 8 people to poke at whatever subcap is on grid when we roll through. Also, you're delusional if you think Null is a playground for your isk printing, we're there to remind you that null sec is dangerous, which it sounds like you forgot. Why is there so much value in null sec? Because EVE has always been about more risk=more reward. Sorry if you're just realizing this fully with the changes.
---
Don't use scrams; points are better. Use 2 if they like using WCS. But most are AFK so they don't warp in time anyway. Without fitting 100MN, bots might be able to warp before you get a lock on.
---
I'd love for more Null-Null.
---
Man, I just got flashbacks to 2011 in Tribal Band. Just a wee little newbie carrier pilot just starting my second account.
---
It's almost as if the real problem is command destroyers micro jump drive module
---
No no no, see, when you want to complain on the internet, you only look for details that support your bias... you make wild and baseless conjectures about thoughts and feelings and present them as fact.
---
Come on bro, do you even internet?
---
Dont even have to kill the jag. Just bring a sentinel and 1 cycle its cap then blap it
---
As a way to implement this idea: give two weeks notice, then remove asset safety and all timers from any structure that is not anchored in accordance with the rules which you suggest.
---
There are no BPOs for t3 subsystems
---
People did this and we still managed to wage offensive wars.
---
Dude, that was back when a fully fit 10/10 machariel was 2b or 4 plex and you could make enough isk for 2 plex with a good 10/10 drop. And even then, I still farmed havens for 10/10s with sentry carriers. The economy has changed. You can't keep up in subs anymore unless you afk domi rat 24/7 with netflix on in the background.
---
This nerf was a classic case of some CSM idiot petitioning CCP to change something that directly advantaged them and some other CSM idiots that didn't really play the game agreed.
---
Literally just typed into fleet chat that thos is what makes eve so great and he had a great time with us, and even that this was one of those great time. 
---
No salt, no crying, not even trying to barter to save it. He fired 1 DD at a moros, then gave up.
---
BombTymer was in horde, he donated a fort or two, then went on a rampage abt how they didnt protect his highsec stations, then he took a Yacht and lost like 100bil of shit to a gatecamp. Dudes a dumbass dont trust him
---
Imagine thinking that nerfing ehp in capitals is the answer.  CCP: constantly treating symptoms instead of the disease.
---
We'll live on bud! Need to get back on the grind :)
---
Battle cruisers with cloak and Torps? Hell yeah, gimmie gimmie!!!!!
---
Wait for real? Jesus christ that dude. All good he didn't cause any real trouble, just some bad moods
---
Good theory crafting sir.
---
Quite the contrary, thanks to blackout, capitals and supers are the only thing you CAN rat in right now. Until the cyno change and then it'll just be supers and titan pilots with 3 alts ready for cynos and fax.
---
Wish I could of spoke to you prior. Oh well :)
---
Them:  "I sub 47 accounts"
---
Others:  "PLEXing doesn't count, you didn't put cash in their pocket."
---
Them:  "that isn't how it works." 
---
Others:  "Yes it is."
---
Them:  "But Goon propaganda!"
---
I mean, you're the one that contradicted yourself vOv
---
But hey, I'm not about to be dragged down to your level so enjoy your day!
---
On a nice sunday 168 pilots formed up and worked together for a common aim.
---
Yeah, I mean the wormhole superhighway was insanely broken, but it also wasn't like it was easy. It was a ton of dudes, putting in a ton of work, both logistically mapping and confirming it, and doing the scanning and jumping around.
---
To be honest, it was also in the time where T3 Cruisers were both the go-to weapon of choice, and also the most obvious choice to take through a wormhole so it was a double whammy.
---
Rolling it back now is both a reasonable and much more balanced change. People will still take muninn fleets to whereever the fight is, but that's what eve should be. Third party fights are interesting and mix up the knowledge of who is coming to a fight to make it more unpredictable.
---
got it. ty.
---
Well I don't see you making any better suggestions. Seems like you just don't want someone knocking over you sand castle.
---
So the chaos era should make things *easier*? That doesn't sound right...
---
Literally exactly me
---
I am not sure I understand.  Do you mean this is a bad thing?
---
Get a hold of me in game and we can do some minor pew together. Amamake area
---
Exactly this.
---
Really enjoying this, and glad you've got a new episode out.  It's perfect weekly commute stuff!
---
Fleet members
---
darn part-timers. you need to hit the armory and grab yourself a few boxes of weapons-grade autism
---
Thanks for the pointers, we're working on a few things to secure the bulk of our holdings from now on.
---
EVE is better than other games because it combines many areas of gameplay.
---
2hours of scanning to get some good WH this is not good and funny game mechanic...
---
k?
---
Isn't that the point?  
---
"You can't keep up anymore" was BECAUSE the current meta was broken.
---
If you don't carrier rat you won't need to afford carriers.  So you will earn less and spend less on your ships.  
---
The meta will adapt.
---
I don't know how much easier it really becomes. What I do like is involves a method of travel that a supercapital can't take :)
---
It was a bit better than last time i guess
---
Thats kinda yes and no. Bots are also unique "players" and Im fairly certain we have more of them atm. Also losing lots of subs mean less money for development. And it all depends on where these unique players are. If people left null with 4 accounts and unsubbed 3 to just stay in HS with 1 doing abyssals then there will be a chainreaction because of the lack of content. And so on.
---
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/201608/self-absorption-the-root-all-psychological-evil
---
I think that depends on what you want to buy with it... if your objective is to make enough isk to buy a new Titan/Super each month of course it won't be; if you just wanna blow up subcaps every chance you get it's still more than enough.
---
One of the biggest problems is that there is too much isk around, everything is so accessible that there is little to no meaning in losses. Yes, the economy has change but for the worst... not saying losing a ship should be the end of the world, neither extreme is good for the game, but before blackout it was just ridiculous how easy it was to make isk without almost any risk.
---
What I'm trying to say here is that there are other less economy-screwing ways to make isk other than Super/Carrier ratting or Rorq mining; and those are still viable, just a lot more risky (which they should have been from the start).
---
Fuck farms and fields.
---
as far i seen the fleet is max 5 ships (frigattes) they can web and neut but not scram. so if you cant fight them just warp out. not like the afk bots who got grilled.
---
Lets just nerf everything.
---
I say lets remove all ships and have everyone play bumper cars in their pods.
---
What did you expect? The EVE community are masters in the art of breaking stuff.
---
I completely disagree. Having three timers and damage caps was the worst change of the “citadel” expansion. Having asset safety was the second biggest mistake. Letting Supercapitals retain the electronic warfare immunities and insanely high EHP was a mistake.
---
Being able to dock a Supercapital is a huge quality of life change.
---
Also daily reminder that supercaps being immensely powerful against subcaps is still a relatively new era in the history of EVE Online.
---
Oh so if I look every two min my orca should be fine
---
Adding chaos is code for I want things harder for nullsec but easier for my playstyle.
---
I believe we will. Thanks for good wishes!
---
Ok well I never had any issues. Im sure a lot of other people didnt either as if it actually worked they wont be complaining. It was super laggy and the controls were weird but its a rough demo. Its quality was pretty much what I expected. We were just there to get the numbers up and stress the back end. I didnt expect to be wowed or anything, and idk why you would. Even if it didnt work for you, that failure is pretty much the point of a test like this. You cant improve without failing.
---
Fratricide
---
Greed.
---
I believe you're the first person in over a decade to say that unironically!
---
I do mostly support this but the downside to this is it allows you to lock opponents out of the system again and prevent beachheads and I think CCP wants to avoid that.
---
I’d rather have a small but active base than a large, off-and-on base.
---
Bit of a shitshow, but once I got into the swing of things I had a couple of fun duels.  
---
I won't lie, I'm a wee bit salty that somebody managed to get 190k ZPC, while I only was able to have 4k for one of my lives tops, but meh.  It ran really smooth imo, especially since the missiles had hitboxes.
---
It makes things less tedious. Less tedious is good. Before this change it didn’t take hours of scanning to find “useful “ wormholes.
---
How fucking dare you. Look at his god damn name. Look at the fucking flair. Yours is blood raiders so you're probably some stupid pve only loser who doesn't even PvP. Him? He's a fucking TAPI FC, better recognize that. Shit carries weight. He makes the content for us.
---
Hes the reason TAPI have all the combat prestige they do. Are you even aware how many structures this hero has obliterated? Why do you the the enemy cowers when their  shitty spies (ya they know who u are, time is limited nerds) relay the ping that he's FCing? SVPG, ever heard of that?
---
 Fucking look into it and get your shit together, Jack.
---
Damage cap was made to protect small alliances from goons helicoptering all over their space.
---
But then he may want a refund :(
---
Disable asset safety and you will never have a player return from AFK. Player return rate is something they watch for.
---
Man that's some serious overcomplicated and unnecesary string of changes to tackle a problem... just give them a bigger sig radius and nerf their agility a bit. There, problem solved.
---
CCP themselves said capitals should be used to kill other capitals and structures.
---
We've come up with a few ideas we're eager to try
---
You do need to allow 1 athanor per moon though since they are a POS replacement.
---
Yep, now they have bombed 2 tests. Their tech doesn't work. Time to let this back out to pasture.
---
what a shity idea XD
---
Lol, you kinda gave away too much with this statement.
---
And has failed 2 straight tests. The tech doesn't work.
---
well than accept the umbrella when you go for a super/rorqual fleet, cyno changes wont change it. the fish run dry since blackout so now you want to fish the remaining stuff?
---
Yeah, skins was the only thing I was expecting to get anyway (my luck isn't enough for the Vegas trip and my PvP dogfighting is not good for the PC).  
---
That being said, I am surprised how bad stuff was. The scanner actually did not give any hints where the big red cloads with the resources were.  
---
Dead ships of all classes showing a Worm with no HP left.  
---
Basically everything being able to outrun the FOF missiles except the Rattlesnake, which is just a massive brick waiting to get swarmed by missiles (turns incredible fast for a brick though).  
---
The fact that there is no way at all to keep track at the score, because your own score always resets to 0 after you die, because you have to log in again.  
---
Tab showed the leaderboard, with players having astronomical values. How hard can it be to give a sidebar, that shows top 3 and your current rank?  
---
The resource collection and combat made no sense as usual, but were ok for a tech demo (maybe let us choose what we actually want to shoot and give us options to manually fire at targets for Aether Wars 3?)
---
Quality of life in a null blob alliance maybe, this is one of the few changes that could legitimately harm the big guys’ super projection both home and with (ridiculous that this is a thing) forward staging keepstars. It’s not just a QoL thing it has massive repercussions for super capital balance.
---
What a shitty comment
---
This has been a problem for me in the past 2 weeks. It looks like the UI’s brightness was turned to 0. You can still see people typing in chat, moving around in space, move the mouse around. Just can’t click or do anything in game.
---
Disclamer: Im not a 0sec carebear, i just created this meme for fun because everyone talking about unsubbing
---
I suppose, but I also know folks that drop them on dreads for "the memes"
---
You want kills-work for them.
---
You mean after this change when half the subscriber base disappeared and it became harder to find things to shoot at?
---
It certainly was an experiance lol
---
Weird. I wonder how that lie would've played out if my partner and I had moved over to shoot first as well. I especially would've been upfront about him not running the Bergmann alliance.
---
As they do lol. I think there should be an in game skill of paranoia and advanced paranoia for CEOs

On a side note, risk mitigation friend. Tough lesson to learn for sure but vengeance is a good reward.
---
&gt;...didn’t take hours of scanning to find “useful “ 
---
Oh *no*.
---
:(
---
can^I^have^your^stuff^?
---
We havent hit peak yet friend, you're also looking when a ton of people were doing Aether wars. You're probably one who complains about CCP cherry picked numbers, dont do the same.
---
Logins went up about 1500 after the test and are sitting at 29,170 as of 18:11. Compared to 30,213 last Sunday at the same time. So currently sitting at 3.5% less people logged on after the cyno announcement that had half of Eve unsubbing - which may or may not include just some random fluctuation.
---
there's an epic arc for each faction, but you can only do them once a year.  they arent meant to be repeatable. regular agent missions arent quite as thought provoking as the epic arc chains. just the same pool of 10 or so missions that you do over and over again. tbh i didnt really ever pay attention to the story line in the epic arc chains either, it's all pretty dull imo.  would just do them for standings
---
Then you're wrong ;)
---
thats the big question about those small gang upvote/downvote wormholers to which ccp atm listened too lol. to make it short, i wannabe elite pvp combined with i want to win mindset in a sandbox game where winning is a subjective matter.
---
I want things harder for everyone. So... go trigs!
---
&gt;Lmao, you’re so fucked in the head I’m surprised you managed to download the client to start with.  
---
&gt;Biomass you’d make this game better.
---
You are very angry :P
---
I agree with this response. 
---
I’d also add that Rogue Drones do mostly explosive damage, but are weakest to EM.
---
That's not how this works. If you fail a test you identify what went wrong, fix it to the best of your ability, and try again.
---
Whats your ingame name, buddy?
---
Honestly, this.
---
Like the lantern festival, launch a bunch at the same target. Give them a slow travel (100 m/s) but hours of flight time.
---
Ty i was inspired  this morning while taking a hangover  poop and listening to rise on the podcast.
---
My money is on O1. He’s probably at TBS, or recently finished it.
---
Absolutely right, I read it wrong as cap part bpo. I'll STFU
---
Well its either the occasional nerf or the power creep. I say the casual bat to the face is a Martha Stewart good thing
---
Valve Time
---
&gt; bombers are fast and nimble small sig... 
---
Once I read this I realized that the OP literally has no idea what they're talking about, and stopped caring about the rest.
---
&gt; And how would it be "done right"? Asset safety makes it so that there is  no incentive to attack Citadels in nullsec, save from meta grievances. 
---
Bullshit.  The incentive is to hurt your enemies ( mind you I think RAISING the asset safety tax would be a good idea.)  I also think they should add more to the citadel wreck drop but not dropping player loot out.  
---
&gt; If you could not defend the box where your toys are, why should you be  able to keep the toys? it doesn't matter how much you pay for it, the  loot should go to the people who killed your citadel, just like  EVERYTHING ELSE in this game. 
---
No the loot shouldnt go to the people that killed the citadel if you want people to actually live in Null Sec and not have to constantly move shit back and forth to Invulnerable npc stations ( which IMO is not getting to live out there, thats just a constant moving service.)  Also it is not like everything else in the game, in fact NPC stations and previously outposts disagree with you.  You should be able to keep your shit after paying for it as that is the tax on not having moved your shit before hand and its not awful for losing it when real life comes knocking and you gotta afk.
---
That's what brought me to Eve as well.
---
It's always a good reminder that content creation goes so much farther than the FC barking orders at the fleet. Between planning, diplomacy, logistics, scouts, and more, there are multiple facets of content creation and the jobs that happen before undock often are the most important.
---
&lt;3 Thanks to all of the nerds who have performed those support roles for my fleets.
---
The problem is not the demo failing. This was a test of the tech, and if the tech being tested didn't work as expected then that's alright. It's just a test, after all.
---
The main issue is all the other things that failed. The client didn't work on a number of operating systems and presented vague errors referencing random .dlls to many users. Many people who wanted to participate in the test, who took time out of their day to do it, didn't even get the login token and so couldn't participate (and might not get the SKINs that were promised because of that).
---
Remind me to never work where you work. 
---
Where I work if we're evaluating a tech stack and it turns out to be shit, we dont use it.
---
The idea is that drops should be rarer.
---
After shield slaves.
---
That's the point of a stress test tho, you can't get good results if you just randomly release some shit to the public without testing it first.
---
But yet cared enough to respond. Lmao
---
What i meant by that is its a frig with battleship weapons. So if u choose what to bring slow bs with huge sigs ir fast and nimble bombers.
---
There is no real trade off for bringing more bombers. 
---
Mix it up a bit. Shake up the meta. Its a good thing
---
Yes analyzing shit suggestions does seem like not wanting CCP to do said shit things. What a surprise.
---
Why bother with this when you could just use a T2 attack cruiser with capital weapons?
---
...Are you in the sub you think you are?
---
You want safety-work for it.
---
soon
---
I primary local do I create content too Daddy?
---
Pressing F scans, and may or may not highlight the 7 resources nodes that are tightly packed together.
---
Then you fly in and hit R.
---
I got like a total of 400 doing that.
---
The most I had was when I found a random worm far off from the fight who glowed yellow, I killed him and got 13000
---
&gt; The client doesn't work on Linux, some Macs
---
Well, considering it's Windows Only...
---
&gt;  because their computer is missing some obscure dll
---
try running the redist in the zip folder.
---
Well it's government. When had it been different in all of recorded history?
---
Easy there, walmart cashier
---
I haven’t had any shortage of targets. I’ve also had plenty of people shooting at me. My only regret about this era is that I haven’t been able to play nearly enough.
---
Nah, easier just to give up at the first sign of trouble.
---
You might not need to play it at all.
---
&gt; The client didn't work on a number of operating systems
---
It's a Windows only client.
---
So....yeah...
---
They just did and I only saw plenty of lagged bugged ships around me, no resources. After I logged in that is, didnt work on first attempt, client just froze. Obviously the Tech doesnt work as they hoped it will. This wasnt even a functioning test. It seems to me like hyperinflated marketing move to get investor money on something that doesnt work.
---
Remind me again why we have legislation regarding gambling.
---
This is such a waste of dev time holy shit
---
Fuckoff with your cringe cyno vigil shit like for real
---
Your clock is wrong bro...even when you posted this 1300 edt had passed.
---
Not for the people lobbying (you know, bribing) the government so they can sell their junk on the supermarket shelves.
---
I got 13000 from a kill.
---
190k sounds crazy. I'd imagine he somehow glitched to not take damage.
---
I could barely even get 400 from the nodes. Not sure if I was doing them wrong, but even stopping there and holding R, or smashing R i got pennies.
---
™
---
You have valid arguments, however I implore you to take a look at ZKill's stats tab on as many regions as you can manage. Places like Wicked Creek and Scalding Pass are seeing several hundred percent jumps in kill activity compared to pre-blackout.
---
There are Windows and Mac users that couldn't get it to work, so the wider issue is just that the client didn't work.
---
No. You shouldn’t have to have multiple accounts to experience difference play styles in the game. Period. Docking let’s you have that account and to have a super for when your alliance asks for it or for when you want to use. If someone wants to welp it and have fun well that’s on them. And no I really could give a shit that more players have supers. The dumbos in supers will die and die again. It’s fucking space ship in a video game. If someone wants to try out a type of gameplay let them. And letting them have many different ships allows that. And hey bud think about this that as the game gets older and older. More and more people are gonna start getting supers. And limiting people stupid. They already can only use them really in null.
---
I mean with the spaghetti code behind the scenes somehow I think this is a lot more than a 0/1 change.
---
But I agree, I'm just throwing stuff at the wall here.
---
Sure, but MAC users weren't ones that should remotely expect it to work.
---
I'm not metagaming anything. These changes are retarded. 
---
This isn't a nerf to keepstars. It's inconveniencing players who have supercapitals. It's literally just going back to the pre-citadel era. It adds nothing.
---
vOv
---
My group has always done fireworks displays and renamed our fortizar
---
You do know using Plex is actually not being subscribed, right?
---
Again I would absolutely consider limiting cyno's to subcapital hulls only. But the refit thing has been brought up a couple times - I don't think it would be too difficult to limit it to something that can only be fit in stations/citadels though.
---
A drawback like agility and warp speed will absolutely kill things like hyperspatial ratting nyx' that fit a cyno for the umbrella safety. That's where that thought was directed.
---
Also cyno damnations are already a thing.
---
In the middle of summer....
---
I agree with your latter two, but the first two wouldn't fix a whole lot of the issues we're trying to address. T2 cyno might be a cool idea to play with at some point though.
---
Just make citadels conquerable/be able to defang them/target sub-systems like you could with outposts/use mobile siphons to steal their fuel. 
---
Would still make spamming possible yet undesirable.
---
I feel like the plenty who agree have never flown a super before the docking changes...
---
The entire tldr proves how naive op is.
---
I like how people propose pos's as the perfect system when hindsight demonstrates why it was replaced by citadels.
---
Seriously. What a bunch of salty idiots.
---
I'm not against the changes, I just don't think it's the best way to do it. There's definitely too little cost involved with moving a capital fleet from one end of the galaxy to the other, and that was partly addressed with jump-aids but still needs tweaking as a whole.
---
I definitely agree with your point that bloc level wars need to be addressed further. Maybe "resource weather" or something to encourage groups to move around on occasion rather than just sit and turtle in one corner of space, we used to see huge fights over R64 moons in the old days quite regularly because alliance X wanted what alliance Y had.
---
Yeah I ended up biomassing my alts because every damn time I got on my alt and got out into doing things on it...bam surprise stratop or bam huge hostile fleet moving through TKE towards our staging.
---
Like us last night lol
---
How many bombers are needed for this?
---
I'm not really against using recons to hunt. I just don't think limiting it to just those hulls will be the best solution.
---
Yes, I cared enough to point out that you're talking out of your ass in case anyone from CCP is dumb enough to read past the first sentence of your post.
---
Re your RFI:
---
A. Drones: Generally sort by size and type. If you suspect opponent is using a Reactive Armor Hardener, throw in a mix of damage types. If you want high damage mix you can go Gecko / Fed Navy Ogre / 2x Hammer / Hob. 
---
B. Decloak: I use a sensor booster on my Stratios and have Cloaking trained to V. Both help minimize lock time after decloak. I try to do a proximity decloak and bump whenever possible. 
---
C. Fits: Look up pilot on zkill - look at losses and see if there is a similar ship he has lost. 99 percent of the time the ship he’s flying now is similarly fit. Also have your combat log open. That is particularly good for determining how well your neuts are working. 
---
D. Neuts: Stagger your neuts. Once he’s mostly neuted you can keep the small on him.  It will stop him regenerating cap since it cycles faster than the medium neuts. 
---
o7
---
I actually do.
---
Dumb people think super proliferation is good.
---
if you give me a list, I'll vet it it for you :)
---
Never said that kiddo. I said forcing someone to have another character If they want a super is stupid gameplay design. And don’t just say well then don’t have one it’s a specific gameplay 😂. Fuck off with that bud. Some people like to collect ships have them. New players log in an look at the ships and say hey I wanna make owning one of those large ships my goal. Let them have that goal let them get to that ship without having to sub to another account. 
---
Wanna know why the game rarely ever really gets new players. Cuz it takes years to actually start to get anywhere with skills. They added skill injectors which are somewhat of a problem but at the same time I skill injected in of my pilots because I didn’t wanna wait like a whole year of training for that character to be worth anything. Game me another combat pilot I can roam around with and have fun. 
---
I used to only have one character and like I said one of my goals when I started playing the game was to get myself a super. It was an awesome milestone I wanted to achieve. But I needed to train another pilot to do so so I just traded for one on the character bazaar for a pilot so I didn’t have to train one, but I would have rather of been able to keep that super docked with just my main instead of having to get another to have that ship otherwise I’m just stuck in a pos all day. My next milestone is maybe getting a titan but idk I really want one. Or just being one of those people that can just spend 10bil like it’s nothing. I have enough to replace my super if need be. But not enough to just spend Willy nilly. Not docking supers just had pos spammed everywhere and you have to upkeep the pos yourself if you don’t trust your corp/alliance members.
---
Did you rat 24 hours last night? And to make it worth it, you probably want to keep some money at the end of the day on top of replacing the carrier.      
---
When you have a couple carriers worth of ISK farmed, come back.
---
Same got it late...
---
&gt;If they want to remove POS'es, there needs to be something that can anchor on each moon, with the usability of POS'es, basically the medium citadels. But I agree that maybe the x-large should be one per constellation, instead of one per system. In general the free-for-all citadel spam is broken, and something must be done.
---
You mean moon mining drills?
---
Awesome to hear! We're really hoping for feedback on this episode. We're trying something different that we've never really heard done on a podcast so make sure to comeback and let us know what you think
---
And the last time they adjusted those timers, they created a bug that wasn’t fixed until early this year...
---
CCPls: Don’t touch any wormhole mechanics!
---
It was a shitty damper.
---
Yea cause reward without risk is stupid. Get over it
---
No, are you for real?....are you aware at all what the fucking cancer of not being able to dick supers caused? Are you aware ***at all*** of how many more subcap fights have been had because super pilots can actually cross train subcap skills and do both? 
---
You seem so disconnect from the actual game mechanics is laughable, and the idea that because it was balanced before means its the only possible balanced solution is about as naive  as it gets. 
---
The ability to dock supers has ***nothing*** to do with the ability to to rat with them, idk who dropped that idea in your head but we have been shooting red crosses since long before citadel's were a concept.
---
Even if a lot of the smaller alliances don't have access to their own keepstars, if you think forcing them to have all their super capitals in space at all times is a good thing for them I really don't know what the fuck to tell you, you're a lost hope dude.
---
I hear wow classic is a thing so go back to that I guess?
---
because those are pretty much the only places in null with activity the last couple years? also lets be honest here 30 man is already a reasonably sized fleet, not what you'd call a gang generally, so the expectations are a bit different, you can't really do much piecemeal against that number so v0v
---
Who is the best EVE eGirl?
---
Aaah, I wish my "tilt" moments in this game were that simple.
---
Giff Diretide VOLVO PLS
---
i guess they wanted to "reserve" the prizes for someone else.  
---
Wish i could have had a fucking chance to test it
---
I got an email half an hour before the test was apparently supposed to start (10:00 PST today). Given that Hadean said that emails would be going out yesterday, this isn't a good look.
---
Lmfao nullbear that’s a bit butthurt about not being able to dock supers?
---
This is the epitome of dinobrain
---
My memory might be bad, but when they introduced jump fatigue didnt they make wormholes to null increase? That seemed reasonable. You can still protect across regions but like you said it takes work and there are mass limits. It's not without risk.
---
This isn’t proposing poses?
---
But it is a needed change
---
Some things you can only figure out while testing, sure. Basic logistics like sending instruction emails at least a day in advance, I'd hope that the people at Hadean would have figured out by now.
---
Why are they "stupid ideas"?
---
You’re fucking retarded, why don’t you go bribe some more politicians cunt
---
Either mop about and cry, or do something. Most people would choose to do something
---
Tevo Hyalhi
---
First, although you got duped, you told the story with flare and actually made me chuckle a few times reading it. Thank for the laughs! And thanks for throwing his name out there because our alliance is on a recruiting spree and we've blacklisted him. Y'all sound like a great group of people, good luck and we'll played!!
---
It was better than what we have now.
---
Make sure to fit as much purple as possible to maximize your ISK/hr.
---
the standard "recon damavik" does 64 missile dps (50/50% em kin) and 28 gun dps (35/65% ex th), in total ~90 dps, so a wing of four has around 360 dps.
---
&gt;should make things easier? That doesn't sound right...
---
So making things easier to kill is what CCP is going for. But making things easier isnt the intended purpose? 
---
?????
---
&gt;The point is nobody wants even engagements, not that a carrier is optimal.
---
&gt;How the fuck did you miss that?? 
---
probably because the point isn't made in the slightest? the entire discussion is about hunting and expectation of response, there would never be a honorabu carrier 1v1, it makes no sense.
---
&gt;The point is nobody wants even engagements
---
that's demonstrably false as a maxim
---
They're already on TQ, CCP just needs to get around to distributing them.
---
Yea I also think cyno mass is the answer. I would have it operate simular to how you discribed different but closer to how WH's work. A 1bill and a 3bill cyno. Also you should get a cyno timer so you cannot light a cyno for x amount of time after you take a cyno (this would stop daisy channing) also should not be allowed to light a cyno within 5000m of another active cyno spreading the caps out when they do jump in if they want to light a cyno after the cyno timer is up
---
Owned a super before they could dock. Docking was a mistake.
---
I couldn't even play, every time I clicked on "Enter Battle" the game just froze.
---
Maybe I’m just tired of repeating myself.
---
Instead of doing shit ideas, why doesn’t CCP fix where the actual issue is, which is that 70% of subcaps are bad and subcap fights with no tidi are so predictable that they make Titan brawls look like engaging gameplay.
---
Indefinite could as well be forever as until next wednesday.       
---
As far as i can tell it being temporary is as much an assumption as to say it's permanent.
---
Took 5 away to give 1 back in that case.
---
You seem upset, there are meds and help-lines to help people like you.
---
Leave it to an eve university guy to know, thanks :)
---
Ratting supers don't fit hyperspatials for a while now, at least not in umbrella regions
---
Don't allow any sub-caps to dock.
---
Remove all the sub-caps currently docked.
---
Ban all the accounts that were ever using sub-caps.
---
# EVEISDEAD
---
&gt;probably because the point isn't made in the slightest? the entire discussion is about hunting and expectation of response
---
It was made in relation to the point that people want to use cheap small shit to kill expensive big shit and cry when it doesn't work.
---
They don't want to have the same level of investment and risk, or to kill someone in a fair fight. They want a strategy eg. Bombers, that is almost completely foolproof with no counter. And they still complain their defenceless targets are OP. 
---
&gt;that's demonstrably false as a maxim
---
It's absolutely correct in this context.
---
Did they change the message about the lifespan as well?  Like, when the hole was about to close, still said it wasn't going to "last another day".  I've been trapped out twice because a hole that was not EOL just closed.
---
You're the one who can't understand that mainfleet, is not the same group of people as sigs and squads, there is some over lap, but it is not he same group. I understand how you'd have no way of knowing that since you are not in goons and are talking out of your ass but that's not my problem.
---
I've been advocating for pushin rorqs back into a supporting role, while not locking the boosting char in a position without any income.     
---
Currently Miner II rorquals yield almost the same as hulks (slightly less) and around the same or slightly above that of other exhumers. 
---
That brings us to a scenario where you might see one boosting rorq per belt, bearing the combined risk for the group (who can crowdfund him if things go bad), while the others mine in barges/exhumers.      
---
You can still use excavators, if you are confident in your fleet setup (defender destroyers, a good intel network, whatever else) or in a very quite region. That rewards your increased risk you take over other with bigger income.      
---
I don't know if that was the design goal, but if  that's how it pans out, i'm content with it.
---
it wasn't even sort who petitioned for the change. he's a big brainlet but he was unfairly maligned for that one.
---
Lighten up, Francis. 
---
You had a bad idea. Everybody has them.
---
Hope they hurry. 
---
My abyss gila could use a new skin.
---
POS'es were used for a lot more than just moon mining...
---
Damn.. that's pretty rough. I'm glad to hear that wormholes are still worthwhile, I had started getting into wh daytripping when I was playing before, and I've been wanting to get more into it. Maybe eventually I'll try living in one for awhile.
---
That is a cop out answer. Literally everything in this game can fall under that definition of indefinite then.
---
That is why CCP was stupid to put that lore article out and why Falcon had to reply when I called him out.
---
"Shit idea" is awfully subjective in this case. For once CCP is implementing their motto of "better to take the wrong action than no action at all". Post-citadel Eve was a stagnant boring place in comparison to what it was earlier. All these changes (some good, some most likely not) are for once shaking things up. And a lot of people don't like it - it's understandable, change is difficult.
---
The fact still remains that a couple small changes like tiericide and balancing wouldn't fix the underlying issue that is supers, power projection, and safety in numbers (both of people and citadels). These massive changes DO have the chance to reveal new ways to improve things. Will it suck for a lot of people during this "Chaos" period? Of course. Will Eve be a better game after it's done? Absolutely.
---
But CCP, who encourage their players, did not run the show. They had no influence on how things would turn out. 
---
You don't blame the guy who hands out the trophy, that the company didn't deliver it.
---
They should use some of the cash from their app (not the eve one that they abandoned, the cash grab one for the Chinese mobile market) to go towards devs then.
---
Content should be as easy as possible to create, the more work you have to put in, the less fights happen, the less fun content and the less reason to log in. Currently if you want to actually create content now you pretty much have to be a nolife mega virgin, and most of these are slowly getting laid and not being replaced.
---
The one thing that will actually kill the game is when all the remaining FCs etc get burnt out and leave.
---
Half? Gold grief, what nonsense, the only people that unsubbed are the anti-content PVE whales, and they should go back to Farmville on Facebook, let's be honest, it's much better suited to their dull and insular style of play. Good riddance to boring rubbish I say.
---
Wormholes are the problem here. Following the normal logic that permeates this subreddit... we should remove wormholes.
---
Right? People forget that things like battle ships and carriers irl get escorted too
---
Then don’t carrier rat?  Its bizarre to me ratting in capitals ever caught on, but then when i started in null people ratted anoms in Tengus, so maybe Imm showing my age.
---
How many supers are needed for an umbrella to be manned?
---
&gt;enough bombers
---
As opposed to a single carrier.  I’ll be surprised if bomber ratting becomes widespread without input broadcasting.
---
&gt;Hunting them generates a lot of content and juicy killmails. 
---
lmao, before the local nerf you were 99% safe to anything aside from blue tackle if you wern't a mong.
---
Yeah it was Manfred Smooth Brain Sideous.
---
On a recent talking in stations episode, in case anyone missed it
---
To me it looks like he clarifies the difference between indefinite and infinite.      
---
But you don't have to convince me of anything. I was just saying, that i wouldn't recommend long-term planning for a timely removal of chaos features, because for all we now it could stay for a long time.
---
We simply don't know.
---
The implication is you're krabbing to get better ships to krab more for better ships to krab more
---
You missed the best choice, combat recons (Lachesis, dscan immune, 100km point range)
---
...and how to respond to threats to your own capitals and structures?  Seriously, allow super/carrier ratting because it "generates a lot of content and juicy killmails" and at the same time "nerf capital application to the ground"???  What do you think will happen?  It may be possible, but in that situation, nobody will carrier/super rat and thus there goes your precious "content".  Let me put it this way...if you can't apply to "anything smaller than a BS" then you won't use it to kill anything smaller than a BS, that is to say, NPC BC, Cruiser, destroyer and firgates...which means you will no longer see "carrier/super ratting".  Do you people ever think before you post one of your "CCPlease" fix this ideas?
---
Dude you literally cannot fathom a playstyle other than the big blue blob, you can clearly see how this completely disadvantages small groups and very much so helps large donut alliances like yours.
---
&gt;The implication is you're (insert any activity) to get better ships to (insert any activity more efficiently) for better ships to (insert any activity even more efficiently).
---
Yeah, that's usually how it's done..
---
&gt; You're never going to survive 24 hours of ratting in a carrier.
---
I've been ratting in the same thanatos for the past 6 months. It's the only one I've ever bought and I use it for about 5 hours a week.
---
I've never even been close to being tackled.
---
Your tears are delicious modafaka.
---
It says allowed to run the starter missions for startup money and training some trade skills so I guess challenge is for trade only.
---
No no, you don't understand. Those are dangerous.
---
Has a palantine actually been built yet? Last I heard even if you bought all the PI materials available on the market there still wouldn’t be enough resources to build it.
---
And before you light me up for being ignorant, I haven’t played in quite a while, just curious if we’ve achieved this benchmark yet.
---
Only, this isn't the first sign.
---
Says alot coming from the guy that made the post haha
---
Man, if only that capital ship had some subcapitals to support it against those tiny tissue paper bombers :thinking:
---
I'm on them for people like you
---
How many chances should this company be given?
---
The lifespan part scarcely matters tho. Wormhole roamers typically run back and roll the thing behind themselves 2 seconds after anything with a scram undocks. So active wormholes tend to have a lifespan of about 5 minutes...
---
oh look another failed CCP project.
---
Press P to get your ZTCs doubled in local
---
when was the last time CCP did something that inspired confidence?
---
the people complaining are ones who couldn't even get to the thing they are supposed to stress test because all the back end work to get them access failed first.
---
darn.
---
Well, what about allowing "overpop", but then applying the penalties suggested above? If you allow your enemy to anchor extra structures in your system, then everything becomes vulnerable.
---
Sounds like you need a higher dose.
---
HELL YEAH CHEERS BROTHER FROM IRAQ
---
I'm a hunter and all these changes will do is limit the people willing to undock for me to hunt. just like blackout this is not going to give me new opportunities this is going to drive people towards docking and logging off and there will be even more empty systems with nothing for me to kill in them then there was before.
---
This sums up the past 3 months of changes.
---
nice
---
ITT: OP wants easier kills.
---
I got the e-mail in time, but after taking forever to download, and even longer to launch, by the time I got to a log in screen "the event has ended, thank you." That sucked.
---
We get it, you’re a butthurt nullbear
---
Why did you get gilded for this
---
Literally unplayable!!
---
&gt;I guess we have to get into your definition of meaningful.
---
Or just google it, I'm not using some random interpretation. Here, I'll make it easy for you:
---
&gt; *adjective:*  
---
&gt;full of [meaning](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mean), significance, purpose, or value; purposeful; significant:   
---
&gt; *synonyms:*   
---
&gt;**significant, relevant, important, consequential...**
---
If you want to try and argue that anything you mentioned was not significant or consequential, then there is little point in discussing it, is there?
---
wat....
---
Nope. Sorry unless you are referring to the decade old pos mechanics, this hasn't been a relevant thing in years and certainly not with anything remotely resembling the current meta.
---
That's the problem I got. Scanning didn't highlight anything at all. Tried with different ships for 1h. Nada. Zero.
---
 &lt;3
---
what kind of damage are they susceptible to? (I want to make sure I'm fielding the right drones.)
---
The music at 9:00 made my ears bleed but watching you bean povar made up for it
---
To be fair, this is mostly Hadean's issue and not CCP's.
---
I'm not sure there's a purpose beyond shaking shit up for the sake of more spaceship explosions... which I am all about, but I recognize there are other aspects of this game that I dont interact with on a daily basis or ever (industry) so... we need a shakeup though and I fully expect the next 12mos or more to be a wild ride one way or the other :)
---
It is very beautiful.
---
Thats not for you to decide, they can do it every weekend for the next decade if they'd like
---
The don't envision a lot of things - that's what emergent gameplay is. They encourage it. 
---
I fathom all kinds of playstyles, and I spent most of my EVE career as a solo PvEr, so don't give me that blue blob nonsense.
---
You are literally asking for the status quo pre-Citadel.  That's not going to solve anything. It's just inconvenience.  That's why they changed it in the first place.
---
Yep, and I have no problem changing that, there are ways to restrict it reasonably without trying to strangle it.
---
I'm with you on this 100 percent. IMHO multiboxing is in large part responsible for ruining a lot of the game by trivializing group content as well as because features necessary for good multiboxing support are by default good for botting.
---
As far as caps and supers etc., Just do the content as it was originally intended, in a fucking group. Get in touch with Corp mates / alliance mates and form a fleet and have at it instead of the current bullshit status quo. Novel concept, I know.
---
There's a reason you get 3 character slots on an account.
---
Why did you say wormholer twice?
---
Huh?
---
And can only train one at a time unless you pay, making it more worth your time to just have another account vs character.
---
say the guy who wants to kill titans whit his ibis
---
That was an honest request for information. Not a complaint about Bombers.
---
oh no! making choices is bad!
---
Even the client can be, thousands of (new) configs. Imo they should have a Twitter support team ready to keep updating the testers about the server and the issues. Communication is key to keep testers engaged. I get your point about minimum expectation to, often I test work for my developers and I expect that it has the required specs atleast working
---
You're very beautiful
---
me
---
adapt bitches
---
+1 for the Scary Wormhole People plug.
---
I understand that this is apparently some sort of brand new technology and I don't care that it didn't work properly but surely CCP was aware it had a massive number of issues before putting out the press release. People getting a free PC and free tickets to Vegas when a lot of people couldn't even log in is not fair. At least SKINs are only ingame commodities.
---
Add in the Flex FOB, allow it to be put anywhere, there is your beachhead.
---
this but unironically
---
The point being in this comment thread is that a poster was implying there is no need to worry as CCP will be able to adjust these changes as needed and we are pointing out that never in the history of CCP have they quickly iterated on changes they made.
---
Yeah, because you guys have so many problems finding nullsec exits. lol.
---
By whining on reddit about changes that will make you less safe?
---
https://everef.net/type/52645
---
most of their ehp is in the armor, so explosive i would guess
---
Not as many groups lived in wormholes with static nullsecs, as there are now.
---
Wow a solo pver amazing, really gives you a lot of authority to talk
---
whooosh
---
&gt; It was made in relation to the point that people want to use cheap small shit to kill expensive big shit and cry when it doesn't work.
---
im sorry but who is saying that? I mean it, all i see is you nerds repeating that and i'm yet to find it
---
&gt; They don't want to have the same level of investment and risk, or to kill someone in a fair fight.
---
do you think people roam with merlins to kill caps or something?
---
&gt; They want a strategy eg. Bombers, that is almost completely foolproof with no counter. And they still complain their defenceless targets are OP. 
---
People who complain the most about cap balance aren't bomber fleet people, its the people who fly the other ships in the game. If you think bombers are too powerful then sure, complain about that, but that doesn't make caps in general balanced(or unbalanced) against the majority of ships in the game.
---
Right.
---
A tremendous amount of work goes into that. If people didn’t absolutely love Pandoralica, I don’t think this would happen.
---
Good joke
---
This boggles the mind. What do actually want to achieve in Eve? You just want to sit in anoms in bigger and bigger ships, shooting robots until the cows come home?
---
That is brilliant.
---
You need very specific fits to do t3 and higher sites unfortunately, and even then if you get bad luck you're dead no matter how expensive your ship. It's best to just ignore abyssal dead space entirely unless you already know exactly what you're doing and have a few billion isk spare for replacement ships and implant sets.
---
It's very lucrative work... But also very very explode and not worth the bother for the majority.
---
So I think the answer you're looking for is no on that last part.
---
However.
---
That would require the capitals and super capitals being....I dunno....escorted? By a subcap support fleet?
---
Doesn't sound that crazy to me.
---
I'll put my credentials up against yours anytime, spanky.

THE MAN THE MYTH LEGEND
---
This needs to be stressed.
---
&gt;The little guys are always going to be fucked harder by changes like this than the big guys.
---
Yeah all those little guys with keepstars are going to get totally fucked by this...
---
Good point
---
They did that already.
---
doubt it, they just finished buffing bombers and blacks ops with this coming patch.
---
The choice where there is obvious better alternative for the same cost? What. Stop being dumb.
---
No, by being in fleet, on comms and helping catch randoms who get lost.
---
omg, imagine one shotting a citadel
---
Instructions unclear, posted an Aether Wars post every hour of every day for three years.
---
&gt; well than accept the umbrella when you go for a super/rorqual fleet
---
we did? why do you think there are almost no roaming brawly comps nowadays? or that the ns roaming meta is converging towards snakes being almost mandatory and not really leaving without a way to deal with jags?
---
we accepted it and adapted as need be, doesn't mean we can't complain about it being shit. Sorry dude but the rest of the post is just a bunch of buzzwords strung together, let's just leave it at that
---
Sure, I list some valid points about why you are wrong and you respond by call me a retard because I don't think like you. 
---
You've got some fivehead shit goin on.
---
CCP opinion on pretty much everything in this game is garbage-tier since many years. Capitals being useful only vs Capitals means you can remove them from the game without any impact on balance.
---
Structures, as they exists now, don't require capitals at all.
---
No, and with current mechanics it probably never will. There is no economic or military reason to build a Palentine when you can have many, many keepstars for the same price.
---
to be fair CCP painted their name all over this in hopes of good press so they get to share in the bad press when it flops for a second time.
---
Subjective doesn't mean wrong. Citadels themselves aren't making this game stagnant, timers are. You don't put a limit on meaningful actions because of the rot, you make it easier to clear the rot.
---
To be very specific, the age of the POS allowed you to DO all of those things in a POS, that is not the case with citadels, therefore to keep feature parity you need MORE citadels than you ever had POSes.
---
All that said, yeah sure if "chaos" means you try anything and hope something ends up being good, go for it, add shit ideas, but don't be surprised when I call you out for having a shit idea.
---
I love that CCP has said they expect and hope for the changes to change everything. Then people bitch that they can't keep doing the same shit they've been doing for 5 years. That's the point of the changes. Seriously.
---
and you will get solo killed by a bomber doing it.
---
Its called progression and all games but Eve have one.
---
Right off, I can tell you that your fit is mixing buffer and active tank modules. That usually doesn't work out in eve.
---
I don't get it. Do they not drop loot or what? Why were those dropped and not put into safety?
---
Damn right we will.  I’ll be back at it!
---
I'll accept that, but I still want to give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
Many have tried. All have failed.
---
Oh no oh fuck.
---
The problem is the whs were so reliable that it wasn't a question of IF you were going to get third partyed on. It was a question of how late they were going to show up.
---
So what, exactly, is supposed to be an is printing machine?
---
What are the hunter-approved is sources?
---
and local was a thing, and diamond rats didn't randomly warp in on you and infinite point you and kill you, and dreads that can one hit a subcap didn't spawn in the anoms.
---
True, attackers will need to be probing as much as dscanning for response ships coming through a covert cyno.
---
Loud cyno would be a messy way to come in.  Might need to light a loud cyno in the next system and gate in to minimise the chance of cyno instablap or bubble but gating caps... argh, the bubbles.
---
Someone in the live stream said ccp would send us emails in September for them.
---
" If you don't carrier rat you won't need to afford carriers.  " So I guess no one has ever used carriers as a PVP ship in your mind?
---
The lessor learned, though expensive, was worth it too.
---

Even little guys have super capital fleets, and there are keepstars all over the place, including in the hands of smaller, non-major bloc groups.

Thanks so much for the well wishes! I understand he can just sell his characters and the money he made off of us, and skill a new one to continue on, but if he is lazy it could just stop him for a short time.

Also, I tried to be honest about what happened and not sugar coat our mistake.
---
found the risk averse super pilot btw
---
I'm not printing any ISK since the Pure Blind war, I have enough for my needs with some casual hero dreading.
---
You don't remind people nullsec is dangerous, you're not some "dark knight" of Eve, you're just one player in the sandbox, stop feeling important in the grand scheme of things.
---
I'm not whining for anything, I merely state facts. Fact is, with blackout and no cyno changes, nullsec has no worth compared to any other space.
---
I'm all in for Risk vs Rewards if both are balanced. Nullsec without changes is not risky enough with moderate rewards, nullsec with these changes are too risky for anyone but supercap umbrella alliances and rorqual/super pilots. Subcaps are no longer worth anything in space Pve-wise outside of fresh food for gankers.
---
And god fucking dammit, if CCP stopped heroin and crack for 10 minutes, they would realize the only worth nullsec had was that Combat anomalies and mining are so AFK-able that multiboxing makes it worthwhile.
---
Balance anoms and mining ships so it requires manual input, and nullsec needs a goddamn huge buff to be even be on par with HS, not even considering blackout and cyno changes.
---
But no, random wormhole people and wanabee nullsec hunters prefer to say Krabs only want safety and no risk : the risk involved in nullsec right now is way off the potential reward basis unless you happen to own multiple rorquals or a super under umbrella.
---
[WELCOME TO THE DNG MAILING LIST](https://i.imgur.com/nQKQnjR.png)
---
In my mind all sorts of crazy shit happens.  In fact you are only a figment of my deranged imagination.
---
But in game the people complaining about "no more carrier ratting" aren't exactly doing PvP, are they.
---
Since you are probably one of the truly bloodthirsty goons who only PvPs and doesn't carebear at all this is an AWESOME change.  Fit your carrier for PvP and carrier rat.  You are sure to get some of  the PvP goons truly crave.
---
He probably would of changed it to "he ran it" or something that youd support to make him seem more important than he was.
---
and then made using them on stations pointless by implementing damage caps.
---
don´t break your pinky while fatfingering F1 at 3 APM
---
and yet people still died in them multiple times a day.
---
Let’s see hated CSM member that only got voted in because he was in a blob alliance, professional in political bribes/corruption, failed Republican congressional candidate.
---
I’d literally rather be a crack addict than you
---
Relatively new?
---
Is 3 or 4 years ago when Pl was dropping supers and caps on brave and wrecking them relatively new?
---
"  but I still want to give them the benefit of the doubt. " I stopped being able to give CCP the benefit of a doubt a decade ago, and they have do nothing in the meantime to change that.
---
This! This is why we were able to get his titan out. Because he dropped it on you, because it was the same FC both times. I know its turbo shitty, but you in an odd way helped us a metric fuck ton!
---
materials that were part of an industry job drop as loot
---
Or-thaw-a-tay.
---
How about instead of blueing everything within 3 regions of yourselves, you decide to reset your neighbours so you can have some  local content.
---
You don't understand : people you're attacking don't want "gudfites", they want to remove you from their space to continue what they were doing, and you cannot blame them for that.
---
It's not because you want something that people should be forced to oblige, and CCP should never balance around that.
---
I get what you want, and I love gudfites as much as anyone, but when I roam in Delve or Eso, i'm not expecting to NOT be dropped and if it happens that I get dropped 25 supers in the face, well I was looking for trouble.
---
Im not at all against this vision, in fact I am very for it, but I am very much against the implementation of it. You think the people who lost excavs will be happy about it?
---
When all was needed was just the removal of excavs.
---
My point above is that rapid and drastic changes would have meant a fast reaction to what was an increasingly bigger issue that honestly is somewhat of an exploit. And if CCP didnt have a hard on for NS atm they would have fixed that pretty quickly in a rapid and drastic change era.
---
So either they are still bad at iteration or they just dont give a shit if NS players get fked. No matter its still a crappy way for a company to behave towards their customers.
---
&gt;You just want to sit in anoms in blingier and blingier t3C's, shooting noobs until the cows come home?
---
&gt;You just want to sit in ore sites in bigger and bigger numbers of catalysts, shooting ventures until the cows come home?
---
&gt;You just want to sit in the abyss in blingier and blingier gila's, shooting poor triangle bois until the cows come home?
---
&gt;You just want to sit in fleet in the same shitty doctrine ship you never liked flying, mashing f1 until the cows come home?
---
I mean this sentiment can go for absolutely anything. What do these people want to achieve? 
---
Personally I used to rat towards a sub. That's less and less viable these days, but with PI+ some ratting, I could sub most of the time. I'd do whatever with the leftover ISK, lose ships, buy new ones, train up alts. Lots of people do it this way. Ratting is the most accessible way to make isk for many. Mining is a bit dull, explo gets boring. 
---
PvE isn't the Endgame for a lot of players. Some enjoy it, some don't. But for most, it helps towards what we want to do, without having to whip out the credit card.
---
I have some valid points too
---
You’re retarded
---
&gt;keepstars all over the place, including in the hands of smaller, non-major bloc groups.
---
There are 2:
---
*  Camal which I'll give you is a smaller group but still at least somewhat has a relationship with PL
---
* Basgerin which is intentionally in the middle of nowhere and is essentially only used as a super trading hub
---
You guys were on a murder spree last night!
---
Thank you for the read
---
5 years of changes making nullsec more safe and profitable: silence
---
3 months of changes making nullsec more dangerous and less profitable: incessant whining 
---
spare us
---
PL was wrecking them with or without supers.
---
Because TEST has been fighting a war there that has been going on for several months and the fighting has finally reached those areas?
---
That seems so far away
---
lol, isnt there no asset safetly in wormhole space? They should go pop wormhole cits if thye want loot.
---
If you actually follow patch notes you will see its actually years of making nullsec less profitable. I see rorq changes and anom changes often when I view them not sure where you are seeing only buffs?
---
Dont conflate the good recent changes and requests like ops.
---
Also, Christy Mack the pornstar? That's an interesting account name choice...
---
Where did I say anything like that ? We need a hard cyno to be able to bring supercapitals on field vs another capital force, that's the way it works and has to work.
---
Put cyno on faxes only, create a fucking capital subclass that has limited combat capability but strong tank (we use archons whose dps is anemic at best), or anything else really, but you still need a hard cyno.
---
There is no other way, in the current Eve online, without MAJOR changes to anything fleet combat related, that you can bring a supercapital fleet on grid otherwise.
---
They are getting nerf buffed. Dmg decrease but will get cruises back
---
what have you done lately?
---
thanks! maybe gonna try as well. it always seems a bit random where those frigate spawn. is it usually next door system to invasion or also further away?
---
Beloved former CSM member who got voted in because he made a funny commercial, lawyer who has never run for Congress. 
---
What do you do for a living?
---
I’m pretty sure he means Null-To-Null holes, not Null-To-JSpace.
---
T3s, stick to gammas till you get good.
---
Lose whatever you had in high, put a drone nav. Launchers are fine, train T2 when you can though.
---
Get drone skills to V asap. 
---
Miss you want 2 invulns, large cap battery, an afterburner and the rest faction extenders.
---
Lows 3xdda II or 2 DDA II and a damage control.
---
Rigs should be purgers. Purger II's if you have the cash. 
---
With this fit, you shouldn't lose a gila in a T3 gamma unless you potato or disconnect.
---
#Also stay away from darks in a gila.
---
So you get to choose how Eve should be balanced so your playstyle is more effective. So you want to choose.
---
Non capital-able people should then be able to threaten supercapital-heavy alliances just because capitals are unfair to small gangs ? You don't understand Eve balance, do you ?
---
Anything you do to protect small gangs from capital drops will be exploited to no end by bigger groups, effectively removing from space anything small gangs could fight. Any SIG in Eve has already a plan to abuse the recent cyno change to fuck with people massively.
---
It’s almost like nullsec has 0 creativity in making isk. Indy? Incursions? Ded sites? Exploration? Wormhole daytripping? Not being afk in a vni?
---
Hurr durr I’m a braindead nullsec bear who can’t find other ways to make tons more isk and would rather stick to my braindead half-afk 100mil/hour anoms
---
the yellow wreck is... the clit?
---
Why? Citidels should absolutely be able to be placed in a deep safe
---
well it also happens to be a shit one
---
StainGuy... Just sit on the citadel dock.... If you get overwhelmed, unlock everything and teather
---
It used to be ok when escalations were one guy in a carrier that would still have to put in the work to properly provide assistance, or 2-3 caps per side fighting over a pos in a wormhole.
---
HAW guns, stupidly OP fighters, NSA, and mass proliferation as a result of easier mining/production but more importantly bloc consolidation have made the issue front and center.
---
Capitals in concept are actually kind of ok in smaller engagements. Supercaps are broken in half.
---
This is what's known as a deflection.
---
Honest, non-hostile question.
---
What is your end game?
---
After 12 years, some people aim for the biggest ships. If you don't want to train indy/mining and you have supcaps pretty good...most 5s with some 4s sprinkled in, what would you train?
---
For me, the goal was always an Erebus. And when I realized the value of carriers, a Nyx. Now I own both, at least until I can sell them.
---
After so many years I managed to train most things I wanted and set out to finish my capital specialist. And there are many like me who started with that "end game" goal in mind.
---
In any game, endgame power will become commonplace as people move slowly towards it. Especially in EvE as sp and isk begin to accumulate.
---
So, suppose you finish training combat alts. You have another account for indy alts. You've got everything but supercaps.
---
What would you train?
---
Ah yes another meme tongue n cheek idea because you are angry. Goons gonna goon.
---
&gt;Forcing you to either not play a character or pay for a second account is not good
---
What forced you? 
---
Just park your super in a pos.
---
Fk, was gonna say ask NC, maybe they managed to figure something out by now. Well played!
---
Sotoyas can have a super docked only on completed build and are the only stations that should be able to build them. Once the super undocks it can't get back in.
---
But you're still not forced to have another account. 
---
In all honesty if you have a super but you main isnt fully trained to where you can play on it just fine, then we have a huge fucking problem.
---
compare it to how it worked in poses. the build process got streamlined so much. it was 100x easier to massbuild supers &amp; titans
---
What’s wrong just because it doesn’t improve your gameplay ops a salty goon?  Grow up
---
Do you know what wormhole space is? Read the post about Jovian history that was recently put up to understand more about Anoikis. You'll see why you can't just cyno stuff in.
---
Asset saftey for supers/caps is fucking dumb. Loot pinyata them when the keepstar dies. Ewarp the piloted ones so they can be camped later. 
---
However, i think with all the nerfs, they should regain thier effectiveness against subcaps, ratting, etc. Massive risk massive reward.
---
And it will only get worse from here. Just wait till they start policing speech in games. Even remotely say something offensive and the police charge you with being grossly offensive and slap you with a massive fine. 
---
For now, it's not that bad here in the States but at times I cannot help but to wonder how long it will be until some government busy body decides that it's their business to start legislating "offensive speech."
---
&gt;If I had a super and then could just no longer use that character
---
Why could you no longer use it? 
---
What stops you from having a personal POS to park you super?
---
Cidatels being shit is another problem altogether.
---
NPC aggro lets you dock, jump or tether as soon as you are in danger... what's the new part here? You just figured this out?
---
I've seem tons of Rattlesnakes just going through endless waves of triglaviana anyway, not like they are in any danger if fit properly.
---
Actually yes I know what wormhole space is and am in it everyday.  
---
It doesn’t need to be a traditional cyno does it.  CCp can law it how ever they like.  This is chaos era after all.
---
congrats for the kill amazing and also fuck that guy    \\o/
---
Obviosly a part of the festival launcher system.
---
You are not wrong...but Chaos...grrr everyone with stuff.    
---
If your talking a break then you must be a useless casual/krab/F1 monkey...(or something else derogatory about your game play).  
---
You knew what you were getting into when you played Eve...expect of course if you stopped playing when asset safety was still a thing....or if you were on deployment...or had real life come up and could not log on for a few days/weeks to evac your stuff.  Sucks to be you I guess.  Best HTFU.  
---
Your own fault for not interacting with a game you are not, or can not,  play at the moment more closely.
---
Showing a sitting super in a personal pos is a great way to get bubblecamped and your tower shot. Depending on your alliance you may or may not get support defending it.
---
Sure maybe you can leave it for a bit, but now pos bubbles are going away. I wish we were still under that broken old system but now, it's all about citadels.
---
Errr, I had a super and a titan long before citadels were introduced. Wtf are you talking about.
---
You're literally the definition of the suffering from success meme. Oh no I had to add on a garage to my house to store all my vintage sports cars. Nobody has any pity on you. 
---
It's like people bitching that they need more clone space because they have literally every space filled with high-grade pods.
---
I support this suggestion 100%.
---
Is it and it isn't. Requiring capitals to kill citadels would, at the very minimum, be aids.
---
I’m a university student
---
And you know full well there’s a big difference between a lawyer and a lobbyist
---
Sorry, I had to downvote your post.
---
You:
---
[ ] Didn't include an AAR with your battle report.
---
[X] Posted something that gave me cancer.
---
[ ] Are a wormholer, lowseccer, or Goon.
---
Unfortunately, this ends our interaction.
---
The cost of Keepstars is too low relative to their value add as a super/titan Parking tool.
---
Same can be said about the maintenance cost of Keepstars.
---
Combine that with the ease of Keepstar spamming and asset safety mechanics, it is hilarious.
---
Yeah, it'd be a pretty bro move if they just raffled off the PC along with the trip, but v0v.  If they can get that tech supporting null fights, with 2k people tops, shit will be really, REALLY nice.
---
This is the type of troll shit the actually gets shit changed just to bury the game worse than it is now
---
Yes, and I am both. Regardless, what I do for a living has nothing to do with my  opinions on EVE, so I don't know why you're bothering bringing it up. 
---
And trust me, you'd rather be me than a university student. I've been there. This is way more fun.
---
yes that's what happened. nullsec has just been getting worse and worse for years. rorquals, super proliferation, citadel spam, ansiblexes - these are really secret nerfs.
---
honestly imagine thinking what you think. nullsec got buffed to hell and back, then there were a couple of changes to make nullsec ratting/mining _less insane_ and you're calling them nerfs? now there are actual nerfs and bears are screaming?
---
yeah. spare us.
---
I don’t have time to reply properly to test members, you guys are basically subhuman to me
---
era of chaos for null = good  
---
era of chaos including wormholes = bad  
---
HTH
---
Ouch, yeah.  I was just thinking ease of use but that is a great point.  And heartache.
---
Porn stars can’t play Eve?
---
Where did I say that?
---
Seems random, in non-invaded HS systems. Just watch the live feed on zkill for Recon Damaviks and travel to the systems where pilots are dying to them. Generally after you kill a group of them, another will spawn within a minute or so and warp to another celestial or asteroid belt in system, and you can dscan them down to find the next group.
---
Allowing reinforcement timer and tether for low powers structure was the true heresy.
---
Trolling on /r/eve is memeing.
---
ah so "i dont care if everyone has a super" well you just said outright that you don't care about the health of the game. that or you are too stupid to see how super proliferation has damaged the game already. either one of those makes you retarded, but those are the only options since you logicced yourself into that corner, thanks for proving you have to be a retard so i didnt have to. goodbye.
---
some player can have you locked and you can always jump gate
---
Wrong rigs - Purgers are only useful on a fully passive fit; which would be fine for T3 (and some T4), but if you're going with an active tank you'd be better off with a Cap control II, EM rig I, and whatever else you need to maximise your fit.    
---
It's commonly believed that having an Extender on a Shield Rep fit is a bad idea, but actually it's not too bad of an idea in Abyssal space. Certain unlucky combinations of positioning between yourself and enemy battleships can lead to the occasional chain of wrecking shots that will wipe you out without that extra buffer - that's a very rare occurrence though. I only run Abyssal sites when I'm low on isk, and would never run a T5 without extra buffer - I've had too many close calls.    
---
Consider upgrading your cap battery to an Abyssal mod - with the main bonus being to its Neut Resistance - that's (arguably) more important than the extra Cap itself.    
---
Depending on how much isk you have, you'd strongly benefit from upgrading your Tech 2 Invulns to Pithum C's.    
---
Other than that, it's down to learning what the biggest threats are, and staying away from filament types you're not suited to - i.e. Darks, and Firestorms.    
---
Personally, I'd ditch the tractor beam and take an MTU instead. Use the spare high slot to improve your drone control range.
---
Your music selections were superb as was the nail biting covops half-structure get away and the solo Geddon repeat.
---
&gt;and its not awful for losing it when real life comes knocking and you gotta afk
---
After some time of not logging on everything goes into asset safety. 
---
&gt;I also think they should add more to the citadel wreck drop but not dropping player loot out
---
You dont explain why. Nobody every does. 
---
Your logic applied anywhere else would mean that freighters carrying ships should have those ships go into asset safety. Blow up the house and the shit inside isnt safe. 
---
Also everyone says why should we get rid of it, but we should be asking if it was right to have in the first place.
---
what about no ?
---
My character is named after a genre of music (rhythmic noise - https://www.discogs.com/style/rhythmic+noise )  so not including any of it would feel to me like a betrayal, even though most people will find it intolerable.
---
Thanks for watching!
---
I tried to lead into it more gently than normal.
---
And on gates
---
Yeah I wasnt very clear sorry. I said FW aside because I would like go around null and I know that FW has a particular meta. Id rather avoid fits or modules that arent made for losec. AB vs mwd for example
---
You know there are cyno changes coming right! Honestly I doubt a throw away cyno will be thrown at you when it costs the pilot a min of 400m to light it.
---
Yeah why scout amarite?
---
Not for everyone
---
This isn't the absolute worst idea I've ever heard, only because someone will come along shortly to recommend cloaks requiring fuel to work.  But this is definitely in the top 10 bad for bad ideas.
---
You underestimate people wealth.

* [March 2017](https://www.eveonline.com/article/patch-notes-for-yc119.3-release) Very minor rorqual nerf
---
* [December 2016](https://www.eveonline.com/article/patch-notes-for-yc118.10-release) Excavator nerf
---
And then [November 2016](https://www.eveonline.com/article/patch-notes-for-eve-online-ascension) the introduction of excavators.
---
That is actually how far back I had to go to find a buff to nullsec. Please source your argument.
---
Well I’m blacklisting that dude.
---
Also I want a titan. How am I so space poor
---
we were scouting.
---
We were a 10 man BB fleet.
---
I have to admit i am not that familiar with the cyno mechanic. But they always suddenly come.
---
But i am not in a high position to give orders, i just try to keep ships alive.
---
Maybe it was our mistake, i don't know. But the fun is gone for me completely :S
---
I'm 100% in favor of this. Lowsec should be the subcap PvP zone.
---
But that's not how we work, We wont spread ourselves too thin and risk being too weak in any one of the areas we control. We would rather just move as a group and taking over one place at a time versus spreading out. We won't do what you want us to do and you need to get over it
---
How about heat damage on cloak modules that raises exponentially based on time activated.  
---
Fuels just a silly idea
---
3-4 years in eve is relatively new
---
That's why I posted it if you're not being ironic. Though your guys are larger and probably have a better security system than we had.
---
I won't tell you to HTFU and adapt because that's a bad mentality. But being dropped by capital and is now Eve life, because 16 years in and injectors helping, people have way more of them now.
---
Simple fix would be deactivate supercapital (not standard ones) weapons in lowsec, while allowing them to move through would be acceptable (weapons could be activable only if the super is hic pointed for example, because defending yourself is a given).
---
There are a lot of ways to avoid getting ganked by capitals and supers in lowsec, I've been roaming there for years and only died to those ships a handful of times... but learning implies an effort you don't want to do at all it seems, so I won't bother telling you otherwise, good luck in HS.
---
A good case could be made (and has been) to ban Supers from LS, allowing only regular caps to go there; in my opinion it would generate a really great enviorment.
---
UALX was supposed to be the start of a Great War. Doomchinchilla told us to nut up or shut up. Frat Said TEST would soon be homeless. Tri, skillu, PL, NC., everyone except legacy and goons were going to evict TEST. Dunno what happened to all those groups. Don't see them too much any more.
---
bUT WHAT IF AND HEAR ME OUT CLOAKS REQUIRED CAP BOOSTERS TO WORK THEN PEOPLE COULDN'T CLOAKY CAMP MY SYSTEM FOREVER
---
/s
---
so what you’re saying is that if you grind out a sweet super cap, once you sit it in you should lose the ability to do anything else in the game? are you saying that stations should come back so they can dock there? that change was a quality of life change for everyone, meaning if you wanted to do x you can do x if you wanted to switch to y then you can do y. mind you people lose caps all the time, it’s literally a fun target to many groups. floating coffins that you can’t leave should never be the way to go.
---
pick your fave ship and stay in it don’t stay in it and don’t dock anywhere just do what that ship can do, you’ll be bored out of your mind in a day.
---
Sounds exactly like someone who has never flown a super. We had garage door mechanics that allowed us to travel virtually safe anyways. That type of safety was only afforded to those did not only had the capital to own a super or tightened but also had to be quote or ability to drop their own structures in space and have a logistical chain to support them. adding structures to automatically do that to every member of your alliance at least level the playing field. 
---
What op is proposing is only allowing safety for super capital ships during tethering. This means that the only people who will truly be safe are people who can undock even more supers and Titans to defend the others. This leaves smaller alliances with limited super capital assets extremely vulnerable to whaling fleets , dread bombs, etc.
---
I’m aware it isn’t a new idea. I’m looking for some example fits
---
Hoping for fits to steal.
---
it was more about null to null / null to low connects than anything
---
&gt;As i said, it was the first time i got ganked by them, we (the random fleets i was in) always managed to escape. BUT that is not fun either. You may not die, BUT it is not fun. That is my point.  
---
&gt;I want to have fun, not constantly run away because most engagements end with capital escalation.
---
As I said in my other comment, only regular caps should be allowed, no supers.
---
HS would be only subcaps, LS up to capitals and NS everything you have avaiable. It could even make a lot of sense lore-wise.
---
I’ll give you that! BUT even I will think twice after I loose 1b in cyno ships just to cap dunk roaming gangs. With the change 1b in throw away cyno used to equal 1000 ships now it equals 4.
---
fairly subtle tbh  
---
bitter btw
---
I signed up for the first test. Never heard back.
---
Yes let’s spread the N+1 game play to all space. How awesome!
---
Yes but 150 bombers is difficult for anyone to kill before they take down their target and they cost a fraction of w/e they kill
---
umbrella wasn't
---
It’d still have mass limits so you wouldn’t get 100dreads let alone 1000’s so not really N+1
---
i could do that with a battlecruiser lol, bigger question is why shouldn’t people play what they want to play, whales get hunted every day. what’s the issue??
---
Yeah, I read that, but the only thing I got was "I don't like others bringing things that could beat me"; if someone dropped BSs on your Cruiser fleet making you run away or shredding you to pieces you would be complaining just the same.
---
I understood what you said, I just disregarded most of it as tear-fueled bullshit.
---
Also, if you could MJD caps away from logi, then it would mean that an entirely new, extremely overpowered, doctrine would exist. Chain Booshing Titans. 
---
I think everyone can agree that is a bad idea
---
carriers and dreads are mostly ok. I mean sometimes you have to bash a POS.
---
I actually don’t give a crap about cloaky campers.  Shit just got real if they want to dread bomb they have to put a couple hundred mil down at least for the cyno ship. 
---
Bombers will probably get hit with a nerf bat soon, let’s face it I’ll be sad when it happens because I enjoy that gameplay as much as the next guy.
---
you seem to have forgotten ansiblexes, which are a huge buff to ns
---
Let em tell you, any sort of well formed fleet can just ruse cruise around supers and titans all day. If you have even 4-5 frigate logi, it takes a lot of fighters to break anyone at the speed people go in those frigates. You all are just too lazy to build real fleets that force us to respond with a fleet of our own. Go fuck yourself
---
I never imagined Id agreed with a goon but imagine wanting a game where profiting doesn’t scale and where if you want to make decent money without wanting to blow your brains out you’d have to buy plex while at the same time bitching about skill injectors and thinking a company is going to remove something that makes them money. 
---
Tl;Dr : Downvote me sheep.
---
I did edit that in and admit as such.
---
oof okay xD. I thought he was gonna go for the dd but considering my hic was on grid he didnt, but then again he still warpped it there in the first place...
---
Keeping them on T3 Cruisers makes all of the sense in the world.
---
no i would not. Assume what you want. I will not talk with you anymore since you do not get my point -\_-
---
This is a very good idea, considering that capitals and supercapitals end up in lowsec asset safety all the time
---
Dude PL was killing them TFIs and Tengus lol
---
How much isk was absolutely fucking PRINTED during this time frame?  How many titans were built?  How many injectors spawned new cap pilots in null?  Yeah it's been nerfed, but only because it started at an obscene level.
---
Still don’t ring a bell
---
Where do you think we get fuel blocks?  Where do you think we get things that require Planetary materials?  Where do you think we get advanced materials for t2 production?  Delve killed 2 incursions in the last week and had they not been blocking the heart of Delve we'd have farmed it for isk. We've lost many players to running DEDs.  AFK VNI is no longer a thing, pay attention, it's Myrm or Domi (some ishtar lovers out there too) for subcap ratting and definitely not afk.  Your assertion that a guy ratting is braindead is far from accurate...granted there are idiots everywhere and zkill demonstrates this everyday, but one loss does not mean the 99 out of 100 other people in that group are represented by that stupidity.  And, if you think super ratting is semi-afk, well, you don't know what you're talking about.  Don't knock it til you've tried it...super ratting is anything but semi-afk.
---
But, you go on with your typical reddit, grr whatever-is-contrary-to-my-playstyle, and keep up with the group think, CCP needs your input badly and from what I hear Hilmar is listening.
---
Dont blue everyone around you and you would have fun and fast content stop crying it ur own fault.
---
Null blackout and Cyno changes makes some things easier.
---
Thats inevitable in a PvP game.
---
Does anyone actually know how to use that site for this most of the options don’t make a ton of sense to me
---
you forgot the Therabois/Bombers Bar fleet
---
Not that i am against this but why does this matter so much? From
---
What I read in the comments they nerfed the frequency and lifepsan of null sec connections. I don’t get why this is a big deal at all. Most groups that live in w-space are either there to PVP or to krab, krabbers wouldn’t want those null sec wormholes anyways and for the PVPers there are wormholes with nullsec statics. So how would this affect the current wormhole Situation if this were to be reversed?
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78506596/ op success
---
Cyno changes mean nothing when you can easily bring half a dozen fax + dread/carrier to whatever small gang you want to obliterate.
---
finished off by a blue Naglfar eyyy
---
Docking supercaps is only extremely helpful for casuals, and casual friendly blob alliances. It (and of course rorquals) is precisely what turned them from "I can control half the game with 70 of these" to "nobody ever gets to use these because everyone has 500+"
---
&gt; That is actually how far back I had to go to find a buff to nullsec.
---
except this part which is just a lie. you didn't have to go back to 2016 to find a buff. you had to go back half a year. 
---
not to mention excavators fundamentally changed nullsec. they (among other things) led to capital proliferation that means every line member is sporting a couple supers and a titan. i noticed you failed to mentioned how citadels fundamentally changed how war and expansion worked in nullsec - but you're right, nerfing anomalies was really tough. I mean not so tough that super ratting stopped being isk printing and most major alliances have nearly every even moderately decent system full of supers and carriers. But yeah - real tough. 
---
Those things you mentioned aren't nerfs in the classic sense. They are slowly reverting a series of game-breaking changes CCP put out in order to make themselves more attractive for an acquisition. We can NEVER go back to the times before the rorqual/carrier/citadel changes so - again - fucking _spare me_ your whining about local going away.
---
Unless something has changed, there are no doomsdays in LS afaik.
---
You should be banned from posting on /r/eve.
---
There's none, and afaik no supers special weapons also.
---
But this is exactly why they are so oppressive in lowsec, they cannot be killed, nor held in space.
---
lol so many downvotes are gonna happen on this post
---
I'm still not ready to talk about it :smith:
---
QUIET was 3rd party, ktx
---
Tell Vile Rat
---
But muh krabbing, reeeeee
---
We literally did nothing. Apart from me, I burst jammed everyone with my scorpion. I'm not sorry.
---
People were ratting in subcaps for many years before capitals were common.
---
These are what I play eve for.
---
Don't put us with Tri! Unspoken was neutral, to all parties. When CENTI invited tri to Tribute we had to take action against PandaFam. Oh and your welcome TRIGG
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the idea behind citadels to make it harder for player corporations to be completely destroyed? IIRC the basic principle was that corps and alliances should be constantly fighting over territory, but if they want to completely eliminate the opposition they're going to have to work harder for it.
---
CCP dropped the ball by not limiting the number of citadels players could build, but I don't think that preventing smaller corps from building their own citadel due to system-wide limitations was in the cards, either.
---
FYI, we didn't even know TRI was coming until they were already on grid. We didn't call them. So you just burned a bridge for no reason. Congrats.
---
I got on a killmail for every group except I think VOLTA
---
ah good tanked orca (with good combat drone skills) might even take them out
---
I lost a couple of TCUs in an Iteron V when my small corp was making it's first move at claiming Sov. I had escorts who were pointing one gate ahead of me, but I warped early before they confirmed the other side was safe, since I was paranoid of what I saw on d-scan. The instant I landed in the other system I was blown up by an insta-lock arty Svipul. The shame still shakes me to this day.
---
Blue? are you colorblind?
---
You have just posted several reasons why CCP should reverse the nerf. The primary beneficiaries of this nerf were crabs (whether in null sec or wormhole space). 
---
As for how it would affect the current wormhole situation, more wormholes become viable for hunting in 0.0, without limiting to those with a null sec static.
---
I too would like to see some random changes to WH space.
---
TLDR: CENTI had an anchoring Azbel in their staging of D7-, we had formed gilas basis to fight but did not expect TRIGG to form. They formed about 30 nightmares + 6 logi, support along with multiple triage and dreads. Initially, CENTI/QUIET were going to fight together but due to TRIGG's hard nightmare form QUIET stood down. CENTI hit up VOLTA for some help through a QUIET contact, due to a thera hole spawning right next door, although the combined VOLTA/BB fleet couldn't arrive fast enough. As the azbel was close to death, TRI arrived with a loki fleet landing right on top of the nightmares. Due to CENTI being friendly with them before, it looks like they had came to assist us unknowing if we had called anyone for help but at this point CENTI undocked and quickly hit the field. The TRIGG logi wing was quickly dispatched before TRIGG brought in triage to keep fighting. The fight went on like this for a while with CENTI drones dying and the field in a bit of a stalemate before the VOLTA/BB fleet arrived, piling on to the TRIGG nightmares. Finally, TRIGG jumped in an extra triage and two dreads to help with killing the azbel although TRIGG were looking mainly to escape. The azbel was saved before.... Allies QUIET jumped in a dread and killed the allied CENTI azbel which was sat at 1%, reportedly screaming "Fuck TRI, fuck batphones". 
---
Decent fight, sorry for the blob, GF.
---
Harden the fuck up about a videogame hahaha
---
It would result in the current biggest super blob sending their supers in a circle around the galaxy blowing up hostile keepstars in order got get at the docked supers within. Now they have the supers they had before and the supers they pillaged from whatever unfortunates that got in their way.
---
My color was all neutral, just got told you guys were invited as support ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
So you are making up bullshit and putting it out as fact of how things are. That means you literally have 0 clue what changes happened and are just whining that nullsec keeps getting buffed in your reality.
---
And yes I didn't mention citadels because those have existed longer then the two years I listed on here. You may also note I support nerfing citadels as I stated but feel free to ignore that because you already ignored everything else.
---
My bet was an E-6, probably works in admin position due to the writing proficiency and labeling acronyms the first go around.
---
Unspoken AAR:
---
Centi wanted us to help them fight the Nightmare fleet, but only had Gilas and we werent going to commit more than then to defend their Azbel. V0lta was around and were going to help Centi with the Kiki fleet. We figured that was enough to even the odds and we came to just watch and whore on killmails on both sides. Nothing happened for 15 minutes so we assumed the Azbel was just going to die. Suddenly Centi sabres show up with Tri sabres and Centi brings 50 or so dudes on top of the Centi dudes, on top of V0lta/bombers bar. We thought that was kinda fucked up to batphone everybody to win the fight. At the end the Azbel lived with 2% so I made the call to drop a dread in and finish it off. If Trigg was gonna get blobbed to shit, we were gonna make sure they walked away with the strategic objective :)
---
they have cap? so we can neut them back , or is it just a quirk of the website?
---
based quiet killing the azbel
---
let the fucker burn
---
gf
---
didn't batphone tri, they showed up on their own
---
because if we *had* batphoned them i'd have rather taken the fight with just them against TRIGG since that was pretty even with TRIGG's cap superiority
---
but you know, i guess this works too
---
same for us
---
&gt; Suddenly Centi sabres show up with Tri sabres
---
We literally had no idea TRI was even in the area until they showed up. We didn't call them, you just assumed that. But instead of asking us about it, quiet just assumed the worst.
---
Wow, lots of contradictory advice in this thread, I guess there's a lot of ways to fly the strat.
---
Pre-backout, the best VNI hunting strat was a buffer shield fit (something like  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/48742833/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/48742833/) ) since you needed to be as fast and as agile as possible as being in local creates a lot of time pressure to get your target and get out asap. With blackout, you don't need to rush so much. If you want to go max DPS, you can go shield, but you don't have as much tank as an armor fit.
---
I've always preferred armor buffer over active armor. The strat doesn't have an active tank bonus, so you have a hard time getting enough rep without heavy bling, where you should really be using a T3C anyway. I'm also a big fan of the MWD over AB, as closing the distance ASAP before you have tackle fully established is important and you're too slow with an AB.
---
I've put what I fly below, you can swap a small neut for a probe launcher if you're solo. You can also fit the mids to taste; go Sebo if you want to hunt explorer figs, double web or scram/disruptor, etc. I like double small cap booster because it allows you to neut freely and gives you as much cap/s as a medium booster but uses far less PG.

As for the tactics, you had pretty much the right idea. I run 3 heavies / 2 mediums as my drone group. You do the same DPS as 4 heavies with a bit better tracking, but heavy drones track pretty well regardless. You should keep backup flights of mediums and maybe lights/ECM if you can remember to use them. A armor neut strat should be able to beat nearly any ratter who is in something smaller then a BS, and even then you can probably take the active ratting domnis I see around, as they lack the buffer to cause you real trouble.
---
The problem is the big boys with the most bodies in ships, and the most alts in ships, can do the most counterplay. 
---
If the changes go live then goons can just fit HAWs to our 1000+ titans and space-superiority fighters on our supers and carriers, then just gate into whatever staging system we want to kill next. Fill the fleet hangar of our titans with enough fuel for 3 DD battles so we don't even cyno home, we just log off at DT and wait for next timer. Because that way we don't have half our fleet stranded at sun because the cynos died on the keepstar grid. 
---
Meanwhile, what other group could possibly do that? 1500 goons in subcaps would royally bubblefuck you to kingdom come (and kill every cyno you try to light anywhere in the system), and 1000 titans would wait for you at optimal range when you are allowed to get a small portion of your supercap fleet into system. 
---
What the current cyno mechanics does, is makes sure the big groups can't royally screw you over because of cyno mechanics. 
---
The best change would be cyno spool up time or maybe jump limits (so X number of supers and capitals can jump to your cyno, then another has to light one for more to cyno in, at least this way it'll buy a few seconds of time for the attacker since you can no longer cyno in 255 people onto 1 ship in 1 server tick).
---
Didnt know Tri was coming, but suddenly they show up from 4 regions away and land at the same time as the centi sabres
---
you warped in with them and thanked them for coming. I guess they were just roaming nearby and just happen to see a fight.
---
Warping in with them was a coincidence. We warped from our fort, they didn't.
---
We thanked them for coming because when someone helps you, you say thank you.
---
Not gonna lie, I think it's hilarious that TRI came to save CENTI shit after Anveri scammed AT winnings.
---
Assumptions are the mother of all fuck ups. Big brain Unspoken man right here.
---
Sorry for post Title.
---
Thanks for saving the day guys.
---
Disruptive would be a better substitute word for your whole argument, top to bottom. “Meaningful” doesn’t work well for the point you seem to be trying to make. They are meaningless as they don’t do anything great, significant, or important for the game other than make it bad to play for all involved.
---
The lokis were the *reason* we undocked. Once we saw the nightmare fleet, we assumed we'd need to stand down. When we saw the lokis come in, we realized we could take the fight.
---
aww, you're adorable!
---
Yeah I'll buy that, now we need OP to come back and tell us his rank!

How bad were you shaking?

He knows we’re on to him :D so probably not lol

Well, CINTI did not know we where forming, we where going to just show up and 3'rd party the fight. but when ya all dropped Triage to fight us. we contacted CENTI and asked them too undock and come shoot you with us... as without more DPS we would not break the triage reps.

Instead of a shield extender, one would have a shield boost amplifier. 
---
Buffer is what shield extenders give as they give you more hitpoints.
---
And any time that didn't work, in came the super blob with sentries.
---
And only if they're fueled, and limit the amount of fuel they can hold.
---
Though that's problematic given that hangars are a thing and all that.  Just would be nice to require some active maintenance to keep things from being instantly killable because it makes it more attractive to kill abandoned citadels (especially in highsec.  Declare war on a Friday and go out with some buddies and explode some structures on Saturday while watching a group movie or something).
---
...Also some of us crazy people actually liked running POS maintenance so that'd be a fun thing to have to keep on top of.  And the alliances would actually have to get a number of people to do that, so having a bunch of infrastructure still has a decent manpower cost to it.  Gotta have people interested in and able to keep the lights on, otherwise everything sort of collapses.

That nag at the end fucking hero.

Yeah, I feel like a lot of people are missing this point. This is not a product that is meant to be finished. This isn't even a test of a product.

literally bombers havent been a problem in eve for years, and theres been zero changes to bombers for the longest of times barring an addition to a focused void but that doesnt even deal damage anyway and you actually need to aim rather than lock and press f1.

its fucking retarded that people think bombers are OP just cause other modules have facilitated their ability to not die the moment someone looks at them.

Unspoken were formed for another timer, not for us and this was about 30 minutes previously, I can understand why you guys expected it again.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78504555/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78504555/)   
---
Honestly we really enjoyed it, thanks for the fight again.
---
Alright spinnyboi
---
pls share

Let's be real, this is the BR we should all be reading

---
Most moved to null statics because of the nerf
---
X-large should be 1 each per constellation at most. Forts 1 per system at most, and mediums have to at least be on a moon
---
We were invited but declined to show, in-case something like this happened.
---
you want a bomb that deals damage in a 15km range to blow up 15 km from you? uhhh you might not like the results of that dude.
---
tbf irrespective of everything else that was a chad play
---
I was super tired but wanted to try out my shiny ship. Lowsec first, usually a null guy but should be fine right? So I look for something and finally find a venture mining away. Safety was red, it was a 0.5 system and I was using a program to make the screen less blue so I didnt notice (f.lux).
---
So I got concorded. In a chremoas. Which is like 350b these days. 
---
Yeah.. That's going to stick with me for a while lol. The imp wasn't as bad.
---
Damn Ninja, learn2redditmarkup. Use \&gt; for quotes, makes it a lot easier to read.
---
The nerf was to null&gt;null holes as well as roaming wh&gt;null holes.
---
This lead to many groups moving to lowclass for a nulll static
---
Random total mass on each Wormhole!
---
nah we fought them twice, the other time was in a combined centi/quiet fleet no less
---
it was the famous fleet where i suddenly realized large smartbombs existed and the gila drone HP had been nerfed
---
I'm ignoring it because it's completely ignorant. It's like talking about your property taxes going up 3% after you win the lottery. Are you paying more in taxes? Sure. But you're still filthy fucking rich. Honestly, you only go back two years in your list because if you go back any further you'll have to add some seriously game-breaking changes in there. You want people to take you seriously, don't cherry pick a bunch of shit to make your point and then whine when people won't play your stupid game with you.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GvL0sXyLx8&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Most wormhole PVP corps I know would be \*totally\* okay with this.
---
[This.](http://www.rooksandkings.org/killboard/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=439)
---
I don't think anything else needs to be said.
---
I've stated  before but for real chaos.  Change that All WH are open and all visible in scan window just like anomalies are. They are open in and out of WH space. See how that goes for a few weeks.
---
Quiet complaining about batphones, batphones goons to help them fight panfam after they went after their bottom line lol
---
Interesting. How did the narrative come to blame Sort Dragon for this nerf?
---
eh, i totally wish we could've taken the fight straight up, and had we known TRI was actually around in a reasonable fleet we would've taken the fight like that without the bowling ball of npsi
---
actually the best fight would've been a combined centi/quiet fleet, 2 on 2, but hey, can't get what you want can you
---
holy fu yes! can you imagine that thunderous wormholers rage?
---
You said there have been nothing but buffs for the past years and I provide you with a list of nerfs. Just admit you were wrong and stop making bullshit up. Yes 3 years ago they were buffed, congrats you are correct on that, but that doesn't mean these are not nerfs that follow up, and it absolutely does not mean it has been 2 years of buffs. 
---
If I am cherry picking prove me wrong until then you are still living in your own world and are full of shit.
---
i was gonna say i'm not spinning i'm straight, but i am gaypwnd so
---
Stainguy?
---
I think more null to null holes and making sure WH to WH cannot be closed and simply close on its own based on time will match the risk null has. This way wh groups who can Krab all day using hole control will always be at risk in the same way null is always at risk, together we enjoy risk together! Right wh gangs?
---
Nice :')
---
"Once we saw the lokis come in, we realized we could take the fight."
---
AKA - once your old alliance outformed us and instigated the fight, and 60 VOLTA were in the wormhole, you felt safe to assist drones to Jehrico? :thinking:
---
just scram command destroyers and you are fine
---
you mean I'd get random entrances to K space in my C4 that weren't frig holes? Yes please.
---
Tradition mostly, I think.
---
well i was gonna say 10km but i dont think it would work.
---
Thanks! I couldn't get the tags to work (hence the question) but have since figured out that I have to be in a fleet to tag objects.
---
The lifespan reduction meant a massive increase in the number of null holes you'd find that would already be EOL - which made the impact of the nerf significantly worse than it would have been with just the reduced spawns.
---
400 panfam reffed our fort with super and titans, and some recently deployed goon sigs offered assistance. we accepted.
---
pretty no brainer tbh.
---
spire still got wrecked, and tbh after goons glassing the north we wouldve been pushed out from ER anyway. glad it turned out how it did.
---
I'm an expert on revenge so I always appreciate it, in a game or IRL :)    
---
Game or not lying to, building up trust only to betray, or otherwise using people is wrong. Teaching the lesson that doing these things to people isn't right and can be repaid is just, right.    
---
There is right and wrong. And when you get to do wrong things and be right, it's like nirvana.
---
I've never been in TRI, and we weren't in fleet with them.
---
We literally didn't know they were nearby. But, by all means, keep making assumptions.
---
20m/s
---
I went into officier position in my corp after 1 year and still consider it as "fast"
---
You are now my sole focus in Tribute.
---
I thought blackout plus the NSA nerf plus citadel docking nerf  plus warping nerf plus fighter nerfs plus anything I've missed nerf  fucked carrier/super ratting quite some time ago!
---
they seem to have cap, but i could not neut them out with 2 upwell neuts
---
The big booms are awesome. I especially like the animations of torpedo's hitting something.
---
Yes my man! Kill kill kill!
---
You already had Volta coming
---
He was even named "diplomacy".
---
Thank you.
---
didn't want this sov already replaced
---
Sort was getting dunked by PL fleets via wormholes a lot and maybe complained publicly
---
I'd say marauders should be added to the current list of ships allowed to light cynos. Gives people a reason to actually use one.
---
Yeah sounds like a good plan. XL c6 to c1 here we go.
---
It's a military term in the US.  If you don't google it, you can pretend it's a compliment.
---
If you have to steal a fit then you are not ready to fly that fleet.
---
So you actually think carrier and super ratting if afk? LOLOL
---
Supers couldn't use sentries lol
---
Are you actually
---
There is no problem accepting help when you need it, but of all groups to complain about an allegedly bat phoning from centi, Quiet is not in the position to start talking about "Fuck bat phones". The result was what ever, the spire was shit anyway. 
---
Just not surprised to see QUIET bitching about the other side out forming them again.
---
I would say the excavator drones and the injectors where the worst thing they introduced. All time people invested got undone cause now people could just inject into the same doctrines higher sp groups where flying so it jsut became an numbers game
---
reading skills are important
---
*had we known TRI was actually around*
---
once you get 100 npsi nerds rolling there's little stopping them
---
#tbt to when you could reliably get NS content as a C5 corp (:
---
Ah yes right only the bubble one, makes sense.
---
GoonSwarm coming for CENTI. Yikes.
---
Lol we third partied this fight. Learn to read
---
everyone happy about blackout unless it backfires  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
&gt;  There is no economic or military reason to build a Palentine
---
There's still a dick waving reason.
---
Actually, your leadership gave us the VOLTA contact \*after\* you guys stood down.
---
Oh, I can do this too!
---
Sabres just happened to warin together right :/
---
damn you found out the secret
---
when you say fuck batphones, sounds like you were intending to fight centi anyway. You didn't like that Tri came in to help centi and destroyed their structure in kind. Yea, sounds like you were just going to third party.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/related/30005319/201808200000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30005319/201808200000/)  
---
This is you? 0.6 btw
---
What if CCP is sitting on a secret OP weapon/ability for it and will emergency patch it in once one finally gets built?
---
It’s already happening dude.
---
&gt; Centi wanted us to help them fight the Nightmare fleet, but only had Gilas and we werent going to commit more than them to defend their Azbel.
---
&gt; We were invited but declined to show, in-case something like this happened.
---
Pick one narrative please.
---
what you on about you mongoloid, this had nothing to do with blackout
---
Tri were sat on a wh 20 mins before they just happened to know your cit was coming out and Oh it took v0lta ages to get there regardless of the fact they had been sat on the thera hole the whole time. GG trying to save face
---
Our staging fort was on the same grid as the fight
---
Wew, that's not nice :o
---
What exactly is a subcap support fleet going to do? Clear drag bubbles while being on grid with an enemy keepstar and Superfleet? Kill dictors faster than a supercarrier wing? They will be able to push off bombers, I guess, but that’s about it.
---
Tri asked you for blue once we dropped caps according to Jericho, i would get your story staright with your Owners..... i mean friends..... i mean enemies
---
They are not already in the game.
---
no bully pls
---
We were invited but declined. We had a feeling something like this would go down, and this isn't something we want to be associated with in tribute.
---
You’re just being ridiculous now. 
---
*Waves hands around*
---
“It’s not worth trying to balance any sort of gameplay around caps, because we will just take advantage of it, somehow.”
---
i mean they probably scouted it themselves but they didn't talk to us
---
and yeah, volta did take ages to get there, they showed up like 10 minutes into the fight after it had been ticking down for 10 minutes
---
I'm not aware of that, but it's possible. All I know for a fact was that they were -10 on my overview (not really sure why tbh, but they were).
---
If screams turn off cynos, could you scram yourself and force the cyno to turn off once you've finished jumping through?
---
Sounds like you sold your tickets to the tribute fight club for some nightmare kills to me.
---
No they wouldnt, the only people capable of building it would be goons and they are blue to everyone around them.
---
I mean, it’s pretty hard to look at Zkill and see our couple of guys there we’re picking off stragglers / people of our position on both sides. 
---
We had 1 guy just burst jamming everyone in a scorpion. Mostly we just had dudes cloaked on grid watching the fight. And it was a good fight, until Tri came and the combined numbers of Centi+Volta+Tri+?? Was pretty blobby for Trigger. So we decided to jump in a dread and at least finish off the objective when the structure had less than a minute left.
---
Until that point, we were just watching and a couple of dudes 3rd partying whoever was a target of opportunity.
---
I know it’s hard for big blocks to understand, but some groups don’t want every fight to be some 100+ vs 100+ shitshow every time.
---
No that's true. I guess it's just that caps are too easy to move, and also counter every other ship with ease. Eve was always about logistic, organization. Being able to jump on your own on anyone that needs help doesn't feel right. Even if you outnumber the opponent I think
---
It would be a pretty big buff to armor tank ships because you’d need to fit Sebos for targeting range or move in close, meaning that shield titans either lose tank or start getting within neut range. But beyond that it wouldn’t change too much
---
Thanks for showing me your real intents in the end, really helpful!
---
every keepstar in region should decrease npc  bounty rewards to 2% or so and these decreased rewards will be store in keepstar. after keepstar go destroyed all stored ISK will drop in tags.  
---
every keepstar should have required amount of ISK in tag in store bay to be online. it drop as well when KS destroyed
---
To be specific:
---
Z142 (C5 -&gt; NS) and N432 (ls/NS -&gt; c5) originating in NS were nerfed. The nerf also made them SUPER buggy.
---
S199 (ns-ns) wormholes were basically deleted from the game
---
I'm still super salty about this change and all the collateral damage that was literally just to stop PL 3rd partying fights with ahac t3s
---
Angry birds worked first time for me when I tested it. Just saying.
---
God. You know things have fallen when I’m agreeing with a Code. member. 
---
Yeah, there were nerfs to nul. But that’s because like this person said, when rorquals were changed, or when citadels were introduced, etc, these new mechanics started at such ABSURD levels of power that NOT nerfing them would have been even worse than now.
---
Look, I don’t disagree with the idea that people in nulsec should be able to make billions in a day. Or that they should be able to make their system safe. But the key thing here is NOT AT THE SAME TIME. There’s just not enough sacrifice for nulsec alliances to be justified in raking in the obscene amount of isk they do. No one can contest it. The money is seemingly endless.
---
Making a system super safe should come with consequences. Maybe make it so anchoring citadels, having capitals or bubbled gates in a system makes NPCs gradually slow spawn rates because they think it’s “too dangerous” or something. Give it some silly justification. Make it so if a system is absurdly safe, it won’t print money. On the other hand, a system without caps, without citadels or bubbles or something will spawn increasingly more PvE content. This encourages people to move around a lot, not camp areas, and will likely lead to fights as capsuleers go out searching for emptier systems. Corps and alliances will have more reason to knock down other people’s citadels to have more systems empty for more content. 
---
But yeah, point is, the nerfs barely scratch the overall buffs from the changes. You think we are blowing this out of proportion? Go back to mining without rorquals, I dare you.
---
Ooh, my turn!
---
&gt;Centi wanted us to help them fight the Nightmare fleet, but only had Gilas and we werent going to commit more than them to defend their Azbel.
---
&gt;We were invited but declined. We had a feeling something like this would go down
---
Pick a narrative, please.
---
Medium: one per Planet
---
Large: one per system
---
X-large: one per region (in capital system) 
---
i fixd 4 u
---
The gift that keeps on giving )) jesus..
---
Oh I’m in a solo corp atm tbh. But if you’re referring to when I was a recruiter for a c5 corp it was more compulsory tbqfh. I remember one time asking how to look people up on seat... but anyone who knew went mia long ago so I never really figured out how to search for shit. We just used people being shady about signing up as proof we don’t want them. 
---
I remember some guy giving me lip about  trust and how he thinks the esi system Shatters it. Which i found ironic as if anyone stole anything there’s no way I, or anyone would really have known. Fucking took hours to find out who the dumbfuck who logged off with the rolling carriers were. Smh.
---
The beautiful thing about MCAV is that they made it darn near impossible to significantly steal from the corporation through design. Which made figuring it out for silly shit silly. As long as big ticket PVP loot items didn’t go missing it wasn’t much of an issue. The stations are owned by a holding corp, the loot contracts to jita were well paid, insured your transport. And only hauled 2BIL to prevent code &amp; theifs. The free ships were limited to sabres, for the saber throne. Logistics and rolling ships. Which were free and IIRC their totals weren’t extravagant.  Our free Ships were stored in a Large tower which forces theivery to happen in the open, instead of docked. Also you couldn’t fly anything bigger than a carrier. Which we had in there but only a rolling carrier with t1 drones and a shit fit. Ships were stored in tons of different SMA’s which made wanting to steal them all require you to slowboat around. I’m actually disappointed if CCP gets rid of the tower system. Forcing people to do their business in the open actually encourages trust cause you never know whos cloaky alt is watching you. Ontop of that the corp paid extravagantly well for everything it needed, including the free ships. They would pay anything up to fuck you money for those so they were basically printing isk keeping the corp afloat. Tiny had a really good vision for a corp from start to finish and I will emulate much of the infrastructure when I get around to putting together my C5/FW corp. I’m lowkey just krabbing and waiting to afford a better rig and an exorbitant amount of pvp ships in order to get enough content to get it rolling. Also Idk If i loved seat. I’ll check out the shit you shilled cause it looked descent. Fuck having to scroll through peoples assets. Gruble gruble gruble*
---
Yeah for like 16 mil a wave lol
---
Awww poor rorq pilots.
---
Seriously, fuck them
---
guess that's how it's gonna be, which is fine
---
if it takes an azbel to figure out who will act out on wild assumptions and legitimate happenstance then i consider that 4b well spent
---
it does make you think why quiet would give us the batphone and then complain when it actually gets used, though
---
Sorry guy, I was watching. Lokis didnt go in and you went in after. Centi sabre + Tri sabre landed at the same time, and once the nightmares were bubbled, then the Lokis came in and centi at range. It wasnt like you decided to work together part way through the fight. You were well ready to work with each other before anybody went into that fight.
---
FeelsGoodMan
---
blackout is cool but i guess next time every gate is scouted. i was surprised we could send one loki in to combat scan into system and still be unscouted. one centi dude was passing earlier and i was not sure if we blew it or not. since we also had to yell at you to maybe undock and help with dps after fax came through that cyno i guess we were not scouted :)
---
The most accessible way to make isk should also be the least efficient.
---
They showed us their rear end alright
---
The people will the most supers titans usually have the most dreads/carriers (sadly not faxes in many peoples case) so it really wouldn't help your cause much.
---
Also, " I am not generally a PvP player ", say goodbye to the little credibility this thread had.
---
Fighters are a nerf when you compare them to a huge horde of whatever size or flavor drone you want.  Sentries don’t have to close range.
---
a scout cross-warped you and didnt see who you were, and then you vanished
---
honestly I thought it was ECHO or FE but the size and shiptype sounded off so we were legitimately dumbfounded when you came in
---
Nah, that would help the people in wormholes, and so far all these changes are focused on making life difficult. 
---
My suggestion:K162 holes are no longer scannable. They don’t create a sig or anything. If you didn’t come in through it, you will have 0 idea that it exists and no way to find it to put a scout on it.
---
its not goons
---
it's their only competent now-ex FC
---
hence my statement, already replaced
---
Sigh, Aether is not even designed and made in China...
---
You're welcome.    
---
Noting you've recently moved from Nulsec, I'd also advise that you look at your implants. Many in Null run in an empty head - for obvious reasons - but in Abyssal space you need every % you can squeeze out of your head. In T3's you won't find it as important, but if you move up to T4 or T5, it'll become vital.
---
Pretty sure he picked one man ;)
---
Thats where ive been hanging out recently. Good place to lose ships for sure.
---
Simple story was you were going to lose an azbel you dropped in EU TZ in and EU region and then blued the entire field because you were going to lose a structure. Seems like the value of your commitment to the good fight is a 4b loss mail and a really shitty story. 
---
GF i guess
---
Haha that would screw us so much depending on the degree of random and other stability signs
---
Wait, didn't QUIET say in the other thread that they weren't Blue with CENTI? Really makes ya think I guess. In the end they weren't blue to that Azbel at least.
---
Well i had got so used to being the one that gets popped i warped off forgot my drones, didnt loot the dudes wreck, and ended up at the same station the dude warped too.....
---
Burst Jamming scorpion is best scorpion, good work out there soldier.
---
I mean WHs have been getting the dick through sheer neglect for years while Null has been getting full attention both good and bad.
---
They came from earth like the Jove did. They were extremely advanced in technology and could create Dyson spheres and stable wormholes. They left New Eden sometime between the First Jove Empire and the Second Jove Empire, no one knows why or where they went.
---
["If I was like, CENTI, I'd be like, saying to Volta 'Yo, come kill the Nightmares &lt;inaudible&gt; let's do this', do you know what I mean?"](https://youtu.be/9GvL0sXyLx8?t=360)
---
lad.........
---
You know its bad when WH space is safer to krab in then nullsec
---
Or 30mins of delay before spawned K162 shows up in scan.
---
&gt;60 VOLTA  
---
Your intel sucks my man
---
sitting on a WH LMAO, you do know JBs are a thing right ? and then this thing called gates.... but sure thing...
---
You suicided a 3bil dread to kill an azbel. Sure sounds like a 3rd party to me.
---
[actually honestly the field was mostly red](https://i.imgur.com/ufhzkdI.png)
---
but like, y'know, whatever lets you sleep at night
---
oh, we were not warping. sat there 10min or so waiting if a fight starts or not so we can jump on who ever is duking it out and shoot who we dislike most. is anveri still playing? asking for a friend :D
---
Thanks for uploading dude! :)
---
Bombers have been OP for years. Its why battleship brawls are so rare.
---
Lore, not law.
---
The heroes we deserve.
---
How about no?
---
It's an unlimited free trial, not a viable way of actually playing. Many MMOs have that.
---
Nice narrative bro!
---
I mean I still want a TRI version of events.
---
i'm not qualified to answer that question
---
in fact, anveri has been placed into sealed containment and shot across new eden - i think you'll find him somewhere in curse
---
Didn't you know? Tri apparently keeps track of everyone in the game's citadels and their timers. Amazing intel those guys have.
---
This is a very well thought out suggestion and I appreciate you bringing it to our attention.  We've got it from here.
---
I know, it was a joke - I was referring to the hotel in "The Expanse".
---
Been playing 16 years and Pando with stuka fleets for me has the most content. His most recent fleet got 600 kills...
---
Upvotted love me some sleep.
---
Yeah, that surely has nothing to do with the fact that battleships are slow as fuck and nobody would fly them even bombers didn't exist.
---
Carriers could, and the supers can RR
---
Yeah
---
It's right next to a lowsec system
---
Wasnt used to that being a possibility
---
Pics or it didn't happen. You mean you hunt in a fleet with 99 people?
---
They're both a sexy AF PvP ship and the end game for non-cap PvE.  Plenty of us use them and love it.
---
Oh no I'm getting nostalgic its hippo.
---
Some serious commitment here bois, take a page out jerris book. Setting the standard for the eve community
---
The horror
---
We would help each other to defend ourselves but were neutral for everything else, iirc I got myself killed a few times by QUIET dudes outside of stratops.
---
Once you have your ratting super, what do you upscale to? What do you work towards?
---
ona scale from 1-10 how salty are you right now ?
---
For those newer players commenting:
---
as the OP alluded to in comments,  the primary Target for this nerf was Nullsec entity's who wanted to roam through hostile space (and more precisely, those who planed Dunks and baits)   
---
Currently if you want to get a connection from Null to Null, your best bet is to either go search your nearest lowsec, or find a lowsec hole anywhere in your space, and search there for a connection, you never used to need that  
---
Removing this nerf will make it possible for both people to roam through hostile space, and for the ability of people to actually plan dunks  
---
From memory one of the last times this was used before the nerf was when Fcon were doing stupid shit in rags, and nek minute 200 PL slepnirs came through a WH to fuck them up.  
---
man I miss that highway..... (Regions of nullsec with upgrades to increase WH spawn, with caps and higgs rigged ravens to collapse useless ones)
---
The point still holds though - if you're part of a bloc surely the bloc can help you come home, or if you know you're going to be away then you can lend your ship to someone else to move it back.
---
I just don't see that it's necessary for a single player to be able to move, with very low risk and cost, an expensive ship around the cluster by teleport jumps.
---
Cynos do not cost 300m with the change. Getting a cyno ship blown up costs 300m. You should not be getting your cyno blown up every time on your own staging.
---
Well i just smashed some Bao buns and had salted pork, so i would say around a 3.7/10 as i just sucked down a pint of water.

Hi
---
Gonna remain anon but i can confirm Tri was aware and invited
---
Yes exactly they're easy as fuck to farm in subs, that's why saying `We'll just form 5:1 numbers feroxes and blob u xd` isn't really a valid response. Mega coalitions don't attract the best FCs, and the decent FCs that do join would rather do absolutely anything but chase around a fleet 1/5 their size.
---
AFAIK you can neut/nos (as in, activate the modules on them) any NPC ship but it will have no real effect on them such as preventing module activation.
---
The only use is to gain a bit of cap back in case you're using nos modules.
---
yeah yeah, I'm a goon I can't possibly do anything without 90 other guys. Well I do, when I hunt I go solo [https://zkillboard.com/character/1254679313/](https://zkillboard.com/character/1254679313/)
---
move to america and fight us pussies
---
Titan. Alts. Production. I personally was saving money to start my own wh Corp when I did it. Invest money into passive isk making methods. Titan is the only direct upscale. But starting your own cap fleet is pretty cool as well.

&gt; and look forward to doing so again in the future when it makes sense.
---
I wouldn't count on it. We can't have you chimping out on us again when someone unexpected shows up without saying anything.

Suiciding a 3b dread to kill a 4b azbel is definitely a thing 3rd parties do. Yep definitely.
---
Hello.
---
You forgot to take the spooling mult into account. The mult ramps from x0.9 to x1.5
---
Also the recon has that much, but the other don't have missiles, and the renewing has a bit less DPS.

Embrace the snuggly rating. Pilots will underestimate you!

If you're 5j out though yoy might well lose 4 of the 5 cynos

+ "don't die on your own staging citadel" is great advice for 1dq nerds but doesn't work as well for smaller scale groups that don't have huge 24/7 coverage. If a 10-man gang cruises through my lowsec staging I probably can't solo fight them all. I could ping my corp, but that assumes I only move caps in my main TZ &amp; have my dudes on standby for it; this is really bad for independent one-man logistics operations, which is a lot of the backend work that keeps corps supplied and running.
---
I'm not sure about rear-echelon support, but I definitely agree with the idea carriers should not be suitable as frontline combatants. Historically speaking, they also traveled with escorts to keep smaller ships with oversized ordnance (torpedoes) from closing fast and ripping them open.
---
In my mind, carriers should be at the back of a fleet or sequestered in another part of the system while their fighters provide support, and those fighters should have some limits placed on them to reflect the amount of firepower packed into something smaller than a corvette. Maybe give them shorter operating time before they have to RTB to refuel and rearm?
---
They oandered to one megabloc.
---
[This one.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/70989822/)
---
Told my alliance to dock up, since there was a Zarvox fleet inbound. Decide to bait the dumb ones onto the fort for easy PDS pickings with an Iteron. Except this Iteron had a Raitaru in the cargo hold that I forgot about.
---
Cue me dying to the few that warped over and dropping a Raitaru. Don't worry though, I picked it up. [And then died again](https://zkillboard.com/kill/70989862/), because the wreck was off the Fort.
---
Eventually I picked it up with an Occator and that Raitaru lived on in 4-P4FE, before being transferred to RTSQ and then dying [two months later](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72168407/).
---
did i ? elaborate then
---
That's some nice evidence you got there.
---
i mean it wasn't a fight we could take
---
as far as I was told volta was gonna bring 40 destroyers, and then it ended up being like eight billion, and between those two things TRI showed up out of nowhere
---
oh well
---
The ticks are about the same, maybe a little better, than they used to be. Inflation means your isk is worth less but blame that on rorqs and supers, not carrier ticks.
---
Spinning harder than a bowling ball.
---
It was the mechanic that allowed every R64 in nullsec to belong to either Pamfam or Goons. No matter where you lived, it was trivial for NC/PL to show up in 200 Proteuses and steam roll you.
---
At least you got the Venture.
---
I had my first Stratios for more than a year, slightly blinged with faction plates and geckos. I made tons of DED site isk with it, but it also was a decent pvp boat and eventually reached 30 killmarks. Then at a day we got a wormhole to Nee Caldari. I jumped that hole and started scanning after I decloaked. At some point I noticed that I'm tackled by faction police. I tried to burn back to the wormhole but they got me. I lost the ship because the system is 1.0 and my sec status was just below -2 and I did not pay attention to it. That ship even survived a carrier drop but I killed with my stupidity. :D
---
The spin is reaching critical speeds.

Smh
---
The honorable version, but what do you know about that anyways right? ;)
---
Eve online lore is pretty grim. She’s probably an exotic dancer now tbqh.
---
TIL, thanks.
---
lol. I don't think you understand what this is like. It's like giving cynos and stargates a random % chance of working.
---
&gt;Where do you think we get fuel blocks?
---
Why do you need that many fuel blocks?
---
They could have removed them, sure. But people still using them should know (and knew when paying attention when the changes were introduced) that they risk to lose them.       
---
And there is an alternative. You see a lot more rorqs with Miner IIs. 
---
What harm does the option for the more risky option of using excavators for better reward do? This subreddit is harping on about how risk vs. reward is skewed in nullsec. There is a choice to be made and i don't think that's bad.
---
Who are you and why do you need to know?
---
Link lossmail.
---
Sounds you like you suck get gud
---
I think thats something from blood raiders?
---
No, it really isn't getting harder and harder. I also hunt solo and find plenty of shit to shoot at. Your sample size of 4 kills in the last 3 months solo isn't really convincing me.
---
No. C4 space gets no more wormholes. Ever.
---
Mizara was a daughter of a mining colony that caught the eye of an Amarr noble, who provided her an education but also seemingly took her ion as a consort or something untoward like that. You actually fought and killed her in a previous mission.
---
Lost half bill abyssal mod in a tayra....in highsec. Yup learned hard lesson that day
---
Oh dear Bob no...
---
That’s nuts that they really didn’t give it some sort of insane system/constellation wide buff or some insane
---
military power/EHP
---
You would think so. But everything everyone has said here already happens in J-space.
---
My vote is we stop giving C4 space any more wormholes. Ever.
---
&gt;It's like giving cynos and stargates a random % chance of working. 
---
funny because that exact change has been recommended several times on this sub in the last few weeks as a way to "Fix" nullsec.
---
And everyone came to third party and just shot us. There was no last moment diplomatic "just shoot trigg/toxic" ?
---
You can see why this is very hard to believe that was not orchestrated.
---
Somehow, some way, someone has managed to be even worse.
---
I literally have no idea, I'm only shitposting on Reddit because my laptop died :/
---
But I like that TRIGG is complaining about being blobbed when they have 86 in fleet where we could maybe hit 50 in Gilas if we are REALLY lucky with most of that being alts.
---
Except people did fly them once upon a te
---
Ime.
---
I think you're referring to a small insignificant minority right there. Many people support ethnic cleansing on reddit as well, doesn't mean its everyone.
---
Considered posting for a while my own Unpopular Opinion... multiboxing is gross, and that being the developer-accepted optimal playstyle is even worse. Ever since I first learned about it more than a decade ago, I felt it ruined a decent amount of the magic of internet spaceships. I'm reminded of "Given the chance, players will optimize the fun out of a game." The fun is still there in Eve for anyone that doesn't want to play an alt, but it sort of made me scratch my head thinking "Was this really the way it was intended to be played?"
---
Regardless of what I think, playing with alts is endorsed (of course it's that much more whale money), and it's far and away the optimal way to play. Oh well.
---
Selling c1s with capital fleets... 100b upwards
---
You showed me a couple of these videos a while back. Awesome chat, awesome vids man! thanks for the share.
---
I just want to share this [little gem](http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?5654-An-example-of-how-not-to-do-things) to get an insight into how OP's mind ~~works~~ does not work. It's a funny read but it also cements the fact that you really shouldn't take this person seriously. About anything.
---
ohhh Kendarr, see the min you dropped that Triage too safe your ass from feeding too TRI was the min we reach out yo CENTI to team up and get their Gilas to shoot you.  had you not drop that and stayed for the good fights..... well then we would have had a nice 3way... but i guess you just needed the FAX as you did not wanna maybe lose a fight.
---
I mean if you're going to try to make a point about resource acquisition and needs, why do you need so many fuel blocks?
---
are you acting or are you just stupid?
---
For the isk investment they're terrible. They cost more than a dread, get worse insurance than a dread and have less dps and tank than a dread... they need a balance pass.
---
Wormholes work both ways
---
I mean we 100% called volta, but TRI did just suddenly show up and, in their own words somewhere else in this thread, "shot the ones they disliked more" - and, to be entirely fair, you did have the more expensive assets on field by a country mile.
---
I mean, I'm sure you'll get your payback in the field in the coming days, but that's okay because sov is gay anyway
---
Random chance on cynos has gone around, I dibt recall seeing a call for random stargate functionality.  Unless you have some to share.
---
A wider mass variations on holes could be interesting, but I would prefer more connections, making it harder to seal off a system.
---
Nullsec already has enough thrown at it, local, cynos, now you want easy wh connections to said space? Next you'll demand that all null systems won't have tether on citadels for even easier seal clubbing
---
Again, making assumptions as usual. You need to learn to ask questions first before you assume things. There definitely was good fights all around, kudos to you groups that do these things. What you don't seem to understand is that its quite apparent the QUIET never intended to let centi off anyway. There's no problem with that at all, but don't start talking  about 'third partying' when you clearly went in with an objective. 
---
Now MAYBE centi did call for a batphone, maybe they are not the 'small gang' pvpers you want them to be. The reality is that you have NO evidence at this time. Quiet was the one that called them out on it first so surely you have some fake discord log to share. Don't call people out on shit if you can't back it up.
---
Yeh at least its gonna be fun for both of us. See you on grid Wildkins.
---
So in eve, you've got active tank, and you've got passive tank, and you've got buffer. The latter two overlap.
---
With active tank you use a shield booster or armor rep (or two) (and usually cap batteries, boosters, implants, drugs) to repair damage when you activate the mod.
---
With passive, you try to maximize your shield regen with a mix of extenders and purgers (or maybe shield rechargers, relays, extender rigs, depending on the fit), so you can tank without needing (much) cap.
---
Buffer just means a big ol brick of effective hit points (ehp), coming from a combination  of shield extenders/armor plates and resist mods/rigs and shield extender/trimark(/or even reinforces bulkheads), that usually is just relevant in PvP but also contributes to passive tanking when it comes to shields.
---
Generally, mixing tanks isnt a good idea overall because you'd get better results by focusing all out on one type. Abyssals sometimes this isn't true, as some others have commented. 
---
Active tank with an extender kinda means you're compromising on your max ehp/second repaired in order to have a bit more buffer. Most would say lose the extender and change your rigs to use a shield boost amp or more cap mods/rigs or a drone nav/tracking computer, etc., depending on skills/tier/etc. Or lose the active rep for another extender to go all-out onpassive tanking.
---
Warp in friends with long range guns, shoot the low ehp bombers, aquire kills and possibly save the carrier.
---
They just wanted to third party the kill you see
---
Nobody needs to 'make anything up' to anyone, if you chose to spend some time helping out with a stress test then that was your choice.
---
because there are no POS anymore
---
Now we need a way to poison people with drugs. "Yeah man, take your drop booster. Ship goes dead and you wake up in your death clone
---
Because Triglavian destroyers and battlecruisers are not broken at all.

Theres a lot more of where that came from. But does that seem blue to you?
---
We need a mechanic for highjacking ships for salt mining
---
Also, is the BPO a npc Buy order or does it drop somewhere?
---
&gt;It's like giving cynos and stargates a random % chance of working.
---
&gt;funny because that exact change has been recommended several times on this sub in the last few weeks as a way to "Fix" nullsec.
---
Jokes on you guys. Wormholes randomly collapse already. And yeah some people reeee. But most don’t really care.
---
👌.
---
I mean, not sure why you assume someone is going to fabricate some discord logs. That’s some tinfoil hat level shit dude.
---
Believe what you want about what unspokens intentions were. 
---
We could totally be wrong about Tri being batphoned; either way, they were there to assist Centi, so clearly there was a coordinated effort to work together, regardless of how it ended up.
---
I can 100% assure you that dread would not have came in if Tri was there to 3rd party on their own accord, or hadn’t came at all.
---
O7
---
correct, thanks for adding this. The spool up time is 36 seconds for anybody wondering btw and will take their total damage from 92 to 111 dps
---
Great idea. I can't wait to roll into someone and cta to move 100 caps into their home instantly because that's how wh space should work
---
Also sounds like a great way to kill wh content. Nothing in your chain? Lol have that chain for 24h, no pvp for you
---
And here we go with you, telling me, how I should play my game.  I play the game within the guidelines, mechanics, and availability of resources as designed by CCP.  How I acquire, and use those resources is none of your business and I don't have a problem with how you play your game.  You asking why I do anything in this game tells me you're just like the communist Olmeca who wants to tell me how to spend my isk.  So yeah, your original point was that "nullbears" are too braindead to come up with any method other than ratting to generate isk.  I've given you a whole list of things that "nullbears" do to support their game play, asking why I do any certain thing in this game is not the question, the appropriate why question is "why does CCP continually listen to redditors who know nothing about what actually goes on in "nullbear" land and modify the game to support their skewed  view of how it should be played?"
---
I'd like to know why you need to know anything about how I, and others in nulsec, play the game?  So, I'll say it again, who are you and why do you need to know? After all, it was you that mentioned resource acquisition indirectly by claiming we "nulbears" aren't creative enough to take advantage of these fine resources granted to us by CCP (exploration, incursions etc) and I can only assume you meant every option other than "ratting in a capital semi-afk".
---
Use a scanning frigate to locate DED sites and run those with a destroyer.  It is not bad for making isk, not as bad as it could be. For fun find afk miners and bump them off rocks out of drone control range. If not for these guys mining would pay worth a damn.
---
sad. would prolly have broadcasted him for the salt. glad i still get salt anyways lol
---
its a joke he was in our fleet the whole time
---
in fact he was our only recon so i'm glad it didn't occur to you at the time
---
this will be 1 year old in 2 days, did you bought another chremoas?
---
the fight was winnable till the kikis landed rip
---
renewing deals 26-43 DPS, the other deal 28-47.
---
neutra is -2.5GJ/s and damp is -15scanres and range; renewing is +20 HP/s RR.
---
Both yes and no. The argument is that if they wanted to balance anything they would have done it by now. Not doing it feels punitive.
---
tbf you guys were fairly friendly with Rote, quiet, novac, etc for your previous structure anchors, and they can form 50+ mains fairly easily
---
No need for closing just have more WH spawns appear every few hours. 😂 Lets connect them holes!!! Let’s take the risk all the way.

Boosh trig battleships, 1:1 logi hunting single ships, but scatter 500km in two server ticks when two or more ships with guns appear.

He seems pretty calm about the game not being worth it to him. Seems pretty reasonable to me.
---
The only REEEE I have seen so far has been the "Reee adapt or die! Your play is not welcome! Reeeee!".
---
Caps no supercaps yes. No reason ever for them to be anywhere but null.
---
im in tri and centi did infact batphone us :^)
---
Balance pass on BLOPs too while we’re at it.  I don’t need more tank, but a look at fitting and DPS would be nice. (Maybe cost as well?  I just want BLOPs to be worth using.)
---
This comment makes me sad.
---
Maybe limit the number of supers that can be docked at a citadel? Keepstars have three massive bays where the supers can dock, so maybe limit the number of docked supers to three?
---
Yeah, a very long time ago. The meta has evolved. Bombers are part of it, but not the only reason by a long shot.
---
For ESI and security checks, let me reccomend EVE-HR. Asset checks are too easy, sort by isk and work your way through from top to "dont give a fuck". Its the same scopes as the old API Jack Knife, but without the eye cancer colors. For small/starting corps it does wonders and helped us find BombTymer.
---
Every few hours? We roll chains within minutes if there's no pvp. Ain't worth having a dead chain, so kill it and hunt again
---
You wouldn't believe how much you have to feed even a small amount of null-block infrastructure. I don't even want to try to imagine what Goon-levels of infrastructure devours.
---
The mission just before you take her doll to her parents.
---
She knew her lord was guilty but also knew her life would not have been what it was without him. She decided to fight you, even knowing that this was wrong, because she could not accept to betray the man who raised her life that much.
---
She still remained a little girl in the eyes of their parents.
---
They have done so well with balance so far, by all means give them more. /S
---
Okay? Must be a really slow day for ya buddy
---
The point of Marauders is obvious and they fit in that niche well.
---
They get used enough for what they were proposed towards and still get used elsewhere outside of that too.
---
Why change one of the few ships that sits where it should and is balanced within that area?!
---
It made me VERY happy that Dan Jintos corp of "What Could Possibly Go Wrong" got the final blow. As in " What Could Possibly Go Wrong if I steal an entire corps assets?" Lol
---
Only one of those that I knew we were friendly with would be QUIET, afaik Rote is AUTZ, no idea about NO. though. Considering we had like 25-30 in fleet or so (I believe, wasn't there) and QUIET had flown around with 30 Machs a little while earlier I'd say 86 is still overkill :D
---
i have no issues catching stuff but i do it outside the gates because its much easier and less hassle
---
fuck now i wish i paid little more attention and didnt die like a noob first 45 seconds of engagement :(((
---
Show me on the doll where snuffed ruined your experience.
---
Yes good ol' ABC contest

---
I’m going to second that, keep your dirty cynos out of my WH space.
---
wormholer btw
---
Well thank you 100% man!
---
&gt; I love a response fleet, when did I say I didn't like when they bring a lot of dudes? I welcome whatever subcap you want to fly to come after me, and bring as many as you want. I might have to run or kite but I can still poke and have a chance of getting killed myself. All fun. Some even drop carriers and dreads and you can sometimes out play those but when a super, or multiple faxes and supers drop, that shit is what I'm complaining about. Nothing about 8 to 1 is fair, but the goal is to draw out your combat force to have some good fights. I'd happily be outnumbered 5:1 with subcaps but the cyno needed a change, and look at that, we got it :)
---
It seems to me then that my earlier comment applies **perfectly** to you:
---
&gt;That's exactly what they're saying, they just can't come out and say it directly.
---
&gt;They basically want a instanced PVP match: them vs their target, with an approved number of Home Defense ships of approved classes arriving after an approved amount of time has elapsed.
---
**Why do you feel entitled to choose what kind of content is brought to you by the homeowners when you get to choose the content being brought to your gank victims?**
---
I'm thinking you don't know the meaning of the word static
---
judging by the fits the cyna could probably have killed the domi and tengu himself ...
---
Reminds me of the old torpedo explosions. I miss those
---
I got an Imp instead (I prefer it by far) but already lost it to a lucky rattlesnake shot. But that was also avoidable - I still don't like wrecking shot mechanics lol.
---
Next up is probably a fiend but I won't use it much I think. Kinda lost my appetite for AT ships but I have yet to play around with supers.. Want to yolo boson with rag and get a revenant as well. We'll see how those will fare.

Erm, no. There is a thing called running a business. Investors to satisfy.  After two failed tests investors start getting antsy and pull out.
---
honestly fuck NS
---
every buff to NS has only hurt the game; prove me wrong
---
RIP :(
---
Mining already tbh. But most pilots train up combat ships before they bother with barge skills, so that's why I called it the "most accessible".
---
Either way the ships that are top of the food chain in their respective fields (carrier/Rorq for example) should still make a decent amount of money. 30m ticks isn't amazing in the grand scheme of things.
---
Because you're sitting here bitching about people unthinkingly dropping caps instead of setting up something to take advantage of it.
---
Totally random? Like local?

Have you been playing this summer?

I saw the video before they pulled it down. What a mess of fcing and no discipline on comms.
---
They said I'm NOT feeding to tri while proceeding to feed to Tri.
---
So short sighted
---
&gt; so clearly there was a coordinated effort to work together,
---
Or they could have [shot the people they dislike the most](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cs77m7/trigg_vs_triquietcenti_in_tribute/exd5gzm/). Just because we shot the same people doesn't mean that they said anything to us about going there.
---
My guy...how many of those were actual doctrine pilots? Look what’s on the BR, not what’s in fleet.
---
Was moving a POS to sell with my Orca alt. Got bumped by a Crane and just *barely* got away before I got jumped by the rest of their fleet. Said "Good attempt lol" as I docked up. Waited about 45 minutes and undocked to move the rest of the two jumps through low, noticed I was being followed by a Expedition Frigate.
---
Jump through the first gate and a covert cyno goes off the second they pop through. Queue me getting dropped by a fleet of Force Recons.
---
Their response once I got popped was "good attempt lol."
---
Great story! I hope you guys recorded this and are going to put out an amazing eve video about this whole thing.
---
Where is it developed?
---
oh I found people in between those kills, but with carriers and faxes sitting in mining belts its nigh on impossible to kill a barge that is pre-locked by a FAX, so you ignoring that isn't really convincing me you know what you'r talking about
---
Just make it that only black ops battleships and force recons can roll wormholes. 🙂
---
Tbh. From my time with SF, yall fucking deserve it.
---
until you look at long term numbers and see there has been a downward trend for awhile but their recent actions have drastically accelerated it.
---
The point of marauders is to spend more money than you ever need to to run level 4 missions?

I mean, compared to us, yea 50 nightmares is a blob.
---
You're kinda mean there dude.
---
:^)
---
BR says ~300 vs ~100. Take about 20 off of each other because Pods count for some reason and we’re at roughly 280 vs 80.
---
Where do you live for that not to be a blob?
---
None of us thought to record it :(
---
But I can put something together...
---
It gives people something to work towards and to play around with.
---
Similar to the way that you can earn a lot mining in a Hulk, but people use/work towards Rorquals
---
Sure, but wouldn’t it be cooler to have 483 Keepstars all on the same grid in an expanding sphere of doom for the same price?

eh, keep me out of this bitch fight of who batphones who lol

Pretty tricky without footage of his titan dying to you guys but maybe. I'll 100% watch either way. Thanks for taking the time to post a nice story regardless.
---
Yeah its great. Stale meta and ‘current’ eve has in a long time driven people away from the game. Now with changes some of the people that were the problem couldnt play the way they wanted and quit. Im seeing people comming back to the game because of changes. Downward player count doesn’t show a healthy game, changes were needed.
---
evemarketer, the knowledge to make correct spreadshet with the minimum amount of calls.

Just nothing to add, they really rock.

Funny how they needed 3 Times our numbers and still didn’t manage to kill all of us lmao
---
I can try to slap together a little narrative, see if that spaghetti sticks to the wall
---
CCP Rice says isk faucets are moving towards a deficit situation currently. Thus, these things are not currently " screwing the economy"
---
Yeah, it was some good stuff :D

What does that have to do with how many people V0LTA had???
---
Uhhh... ok.
---
Bye
---
It is ok. I just wanted to share my frustration.
---
On my first try, my fleet wanted me to have scrams and webs and fighter drones with me, to support the pew pew. BUT i messed up, and mixed up enemies and friends and ended up repping the enemies and made the whole fleet die :(
---
I just care about the fun, not about a good killboard, kills, tear harvesting or killmarks.
---
My killboard does not have 1 kill on it. Mostly because i am bad xD  
---
But i also do not really care to win fights, i care about the fun i have while fighting or supporting fleets.
---
BTW; The russians are the players i have consistently had the most fun with. I love their "i don't give a fuck" attitude. After i let the whole fleet die due to me repping enemies because i am stupid, not only did they not kick me from the fleet, but they said don't worry, and we did another roam &lt;3
---
I got kicked from fleets from other fleets for less lol. I love the russians for their attitudes. I think they enjoy eve the most.

The change as proposed is literally flipping a few switches of dogma attributes.  It's like a 5min PR.  It's unreasonable to act like they've committed a considerable amount of development bandwidth and already have sunk cost.  
---
Usually when CCP does this stuff, they're looking for input.  They set the context by proposing a rattling change.     
---
 It's simple, incomplete, but bold and gets people to talk.  Playerbase makes posts like this.  CCP scopes &amp; decides what they're willing to commit to a first pass.  Actual changes drop, sometimes exactly what they said, sometimes not.

*Bait Detected*

Spicy killmails for some pretty spicy fights. Sweet Armageddon fights, good pod pilot. And GF's to all involved.
---
Do all goons cry this much ?

I was wondering this I followed you fleet from kalevala once I saw garst. I was thinking huh wormhole what wormhole?  I eventually lost track of your fleet at D7 you disappeared. Surprised me to see you there dunking on kendar causing him to reeeeeee. Brought a tear to my eye. Much salt was had I'm sure. 
---
I saw garst and I thought oh boy this will be fun, tri is gonna drop a hammer on them. No dreads though? Glad to see he's active anyway.
---
If you guys have people in a combat fleet that don't have any business being in that fleet you guys have bigger issues than your comms discipline or getting blobbed :thinking:, regardless, I'd say you guys had caps on standby based off the numbers in fleet, which we didn't because we had literally every capable alt in a Gila lmao.
---
I, too, am in Tri and it is true, they batphoned us :^)
---
Im in tri with him and hes 100% legit, trust me

UK

i wouldnt exactly call the cookie cutter PvE purger gila a "very specific fit" because it runs T3 exotics very easily
---
I'm going to go with a classic here: lol nice shitpost
---
Only Higgs anchors reduce wh mass when passing through. Any ship with a Higgs anchor has a 50% chance of being immobilized for an unknown number of minutes between 5 &amp; 12 for each pass.
---
I can confirm I was the hammerhead
---
Damn, can't believe I missed that...
---
Yes it's bait. Don't drop the mtu untill the area is cleared if you want to prevent it.
---
We were indeed batphoned by centi t. Garth tyrell
---
It wasn’t just Volta bro. And even if, Centi literally admitted to batphoning Volta. And if you’re eyes aren’t severely damaged you can watch the Video posted in the Thread and, not only can you see more that 28 dudes, but also people that aren’t in Volta...what a fucking surprise. For a fact, Centi, Tri and BB/Volta/whatever were on the same side and did not shoot each other. And if you now take a look at the BR, no matter how you do it, if you have those three entities on one side, you will see that we have been *heavily* outnumbered. 
---
But what do I know anyways?
---
I don’t care how you play your game. That’s why I want you to stop bitching about it.
---
yeah you can also copy the list to clipboard and then take it to trade hub and buy for the best price.
---
Name checks out, you should too.
---
you could have nuked him and then gtfo and dock up until engagement timer runs out besides that not much
---
If they further nerf caps then the big alliances will just move to using more supers and titans. It's only harming the smaller people
---
&gt;Adding chaos is code for I want things harder for null***blocs*** but easier for not nullblocs.
---
You made a mistake, I fixed that for you.
---
Discovered this last week. Listened to all the episodes already. Very enjoyable! Thanks guys.
---
No shit Sherlock, congratulations. 
---
Now tell me, what does that change about the fact that you brought in 3 Times our numbers?
---
They probably have plenty, but still doesnt help them get better at the game.
---
Don't stray from your MTU so you can scoop it and don't attack someone who attacked your MTU. 
---
I love killing MTUs they are like little loot pinatas you never know what's gonna come out when you crack em open. And sometimes you get free kills on cranky owners who think that their Vexor with T1 drones is a match for your T3C.
---
maybe because a part is from me ;) ;) ;)
