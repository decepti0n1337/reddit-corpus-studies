Thanks everyone for the tips, i have started training more skills to hopefully be ready for t4 abysses in t2 gila fits in a month, since after seeing many people mention fits were not 1b for t4 i did a much more in depth dig online and found out that it seems perfectly possible in 500m fits, with any luck with the money and skill i gain in t4s i can then graduate to t5s!

Sounds like a good idea, I also would like to add my own touch and say they should be limited to flying rookie ships in potato mode only.

"the interface could only be less intuitive if it was at the bottom of a fucking well"
---
The interface between the engines and hull would need to be stronger than "[the strong force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction)" to keep from mushing all those poor defenseless atoms into [degenerate matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter). [Scrith](https://larryniven.fandom.com/wiki/Scrith) would not be strong enough. Frankly, the stuff that holds the engines inside of an Imperial Star Destroyer would need scrith to avoid pushing the engines through the front of the ship every time they hit the gas.

Here we go again..
---
Just ask one of the guys that is a rocket scientist in your alliance, they'll know.
---
if one titan is 15km long and costs \~55b, those being 400km would probably cost multiple tens of trillions to build, and  might sell for 100t or more, just speculating. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
btw 100t is a bit more than 1/3rd of goons total killed according to zkill
---
Yeah I was wondering that myself, the Injectors and Plex are worth somewhere in the ballpark of 375m isk.

Oh god you're the guy that bitched and whined on the forums like there's no tomorrow after getting pounded in high-sec

I like how you switched from complete crybaby on the forums to statistical analyzer on Reddit in order to seem more respectable. You're ignorant as shit if you thought we wouldn't notice.

Did you really expect us to not notice how you're the same person or something?

Is he seriously so fucking retarded that he interprets the join date of a Corp as a characters age?

No I remember it exactly. It was for buying plex through his site then getting extra promo credit to redeem items and or play in promos. This is basically that but without the plex vending.

I'm sorry that you don't understand what it is that diplomats do.  I am fully aware that you don't know what you are talking about as well.  PL and NC. are both allied with each other, and have had each other set as blue for a long time.  They are literally part of the same coalition.
---
I heard Pandaland and thought this would be the sm3ll boys at it again :) it was not :(
---
Not if the other 9 accounts I've also bought have something to say about it.
---
noone ever disputed that. i think were indeed having a misunderstanding here, allthough not the one i thought.

Iirc the original in game models were comparatively small due to engine limitations and they also first showed up in the age before titans were put into EVE

Made an advert :)

I‚Äôm talking about actual politics

I thought Rote died when they road tripped south years ago.

If the events are grindy and full of bugs like the last few, then yea, the playerbase does not like events.

Nah, that loss was him dropping on my rorqual, ektallion just happened to join the response fleet and got final blow.
---
I'll go back and reread then lol
---
Ahh, sorry, got confused as to what coalition we were talking about lol.  Legacy/FI.RE.  Yeah, they are "friends", but as far as the russians being part of Legacy, that is farcical. They have the same relationship that up until this past week DeadCo and PANFAM had.
---

The nerf was more geared to Gilas use in PvE. It's main effect in PvP was to make them more vulnerable to dedicated smartbombers, but that was already a counter to them, it didn't give them a new weakness.
---
What is the best way to tell the source of an item? IE - is it from an NPC drop? Vendor? Manufactured?
---
Also, is there a market tool that shows sales volume per station?
---
I'm referring to years ago when Xenuria joined Gallente militia - the torrent of elaborate trolling shite posts at that time were similar to Noori/Naari or whatever's trollpost CSM campaign. Getting noticed - even for being a shitposter seems to work as far as CSM voting goes.... precedent set.
---
\[I'm assuming possibly incorrectly Noori/Naari (CSM candidate) are the same moronic player and perhaps I do give them more credit than they deserve and he really is just an imitator rather than elaborate troll.\]
---
The Jove
---
i wouldn't call it the *same*, but you're right it's pretty close to that. But as long as it can be afforded to keep up that relationship they can effectively be seen as a coalition. maybe not in the sense as most eve players see it but in a more classical one.

Can you guys evict MCAV first?

I referred to FW as wasteland as it was pretty dead compared to low/null, just my personal experience tho..
---
I read this in Alex trebecks voice.
---
That I can agree with.  Just some were wanting FI.RE to be listed under Legacy was what I took umbrage with.
---
Glad we could work it out ;)
---
Yeah that's true
---
Nice. Legacy oppression of provi ended by the King, the pandas and SF lmao
---
Why use valuable CONCORD resources when you can pay capsuleers a tiny pittance to go keep the Sansha in check?
---
well yeah you're right, if anything there would have to be a new name to put Legacy and FI.RE under. not that it matters much. also coalitionception would be getting stupid at that point

It is most visible on the Ibis. Somehow I couldn't read the text on any other ship properly.

If the donation of cash in any way influences a lottery or is otherwise exchanged for in game items or money then it's a EULA violation.

Dude, you have guaranteed that you will never be left alone in this game ever again. Congrats, now fuck off.
---
Well I‚Äôd assume that with the Eve universes advanced understanding of gravity and space manipulation (warp drives and stargates) id assume it wouldn‚Äôt use traditional thrusters and might use some sort of spatial distortion to gently accelerate the entire ship across its bulk (though it‚Äôll fuck up any ship near it) so as to not completely rip the ship apart
---
CONCORD literally respond instantly to the destruction of a rookie ship that is given FREE whenever you dock in a station without a ship that results in no(?) deaths (not sure if there are people on rookie ships).

But the sanshas nation hazing planets of citizens is not worth resources vOv

That website looks pretty dope. Would it be possible to extract data from public corp adverts over an API from CCP or is that data not accessible as easily?

Are you retarded? You must be if you're a Trump supporter. But let's get back to the point.

This is reddit, a place where no one gives a fuck what you think, but more importantly marks edited comments and includes a time when comments are edited.

Good job, bro!

Still not seeing anywhere where you pointed out what I said that was "blatantly false."

But I am seeing plenty of level 10 autism...

1. Almost everything is player build. However, if you right click and hit "Show Info" it will have an industry page if it can be built. This isn't 100% accurate, as some things don't have blueprints available.
---
2. Usually the Show Info screen and looking at its category under the market groups (click "View Market")
---
3. The in-game market window has a graph or table view available that shows volumes trades in that region
---
Oh boy, it‚Äôs so angry at me, I‚Äôm so scared!! It thinks I like trump too, god damn what a specimen!

---
You're trying too hard with this post.
---
Yeah this game is not newbie friendly which is weird, almost zero safe zones and if you joined corps then warddec then you cant go anywhere safely without risk your ships getting blow up, waiting for a month before you can fly a good ship for PVP unless you using injector, i means this game is obviously driven by real money which is sad.

For humanities sake, please don't breed.

---
I've been playing EVE on and off since the beginning. Leave for about 9-12 months then come back. Always making a new character each time (stupid, I know), but the main reason I leave is because I can never find a corp that suits me.
---
Looking at it, though, if you could integrate a time zone filter, that would be awesome! I live in Australia, and finding Australian based action is pretty hard. Though I'm probably just looking in the wrong place.
---
I mean, it sounds like you don't want high-sec to be a thing. Understandably it doesn't make much sense why Concord cant spare one ship to wipe out all of Sansha's Nation, while simultaneously being able to appear in any High-sec system in a matter of seconds.  
---
But I have to imagine back when the game launched and the lore regarding them was next to non-existent, It was probably just cooler then having your ship just evaporate from nothing because you shot some guy in high-sec.
---
&gt;Still not seeing anywhere where you pointed out what I said that was "blatantly false."
---
God you're a special kind of dense aren't you.

I was there when Sarpati stole one. Was a very WTF moment and totally blew my mind. I really didn't give a shit about Canon until then.

I started FW just over a week ago. Plenty of 1v1 fights, even though I lose most of them because I'm new and have no clue what to engage and what not to. Not to mention all the noob mistakes. I've learned a lot and dont have any complaints though. Maybe you just need to play some more, look for the names of the people you come across that do the gate camp thing, avoid them, and try to have fun?
---
Can confirm.
---
I was roaming in a solo Abaddon in FW space, and I got baited into a station undock fight with a solo pilot who logged on a boosher, logi, and barghest alts as soon as I engaged.
---
Luckily, the kind of people who rely on these tactics actually suck shit at the game, so he pissed himself when I lit up his boosher and I left with ease.

I can't find the exact lore acticle, but I'm 99% sure that the Gallente had a fleet of Solteurs ready to go in to deal with the Luminaire situation.

god damn that's amazing
---
It's basically a high-end T2 fit. I've done some testing and Diamond Caracals put out about 400dps/sec using CN Inferno HAMs.
---
Which isn't *super* threatening on its own. Except that Diamond Caracals tend to fly in a fleet of a dozen or so. That Rorq could tank around 1600dps/sec of thermal damage (while its cap lasted, anyhow), so it could only tank the first 4 Caracals. Which is to say that the other 8 Caracals quickly had their way with it.
---
Sorry man. If I could get to you, id help.
---
&gt; how the fuck do you die to diamond rats on a gate?
---
By getting pointed and webbed by the Kestrels that fly with them. 4 Diamond Kessies would bring a Rorq to a halt.
---
Imagine if the triglavians is just one giant build up to an event...
---
I feel you my man, same shit here. But in my case I type the exact name of the Corp and 20 other different corps come up..
---
I started playing a few years ago, but will be getting back in soon, I've been watching tutorials and researching fittings, but what I really have a tough time deciding personally is if I should pick Amarr or Caldari. The first time I picked Caldari and rather liked it, but I know alot more about the game now than I did then. I'm going to start with alpha for a while, so I'm going to be limited in ships to whichever I choose, any tips that might help?

Macrowarp drive my friend. Nothing micro about this baby.
---
Alphas are no longer Empire locked.
---
Stay on your previous character so you can allready fly some ships and build up further. There is not really a reason getting a second character and resetting your previous progress tbh--
---
Both Amarr and Caldari have some really strong ship choices *(Confessor, Purifier, Malediction, Curse, Legion* | *Jackdaw, Kitsune, Stork, Cerberus, Tengu)* but for beginners you might also want to look into Gallente Fed. Ships since those ugly space potatoes are really decent for PvE ratting and perform overall very well since the rely on Drones as Weapontype and those are versetile asf.
---
If you combine Caldari and Gallente Cruiser you unlock Guristas Pirate Faction ships, their Gila is kinda known as being the King for PvE since it can be brought into all kinds of situations and perform impressively well.
---
Sure Amarr have some good PvE ships as well, look at the Sakrilege for Abyssal Content but they're skill intensive and very expensive to fly.
---
Caldari Cerberus / Tengu can function for PvE purposes too but require way more skillpoints compared to a Gila.
---
If you are interested in PvP all Factions have their strenghts, Amarr T3 Destroyer Confessor is known for its baittank, Gallente T3D Hecate puts out battleship like dps on a tiny Destroyer sized Vessel and Caldari Jackdaw is very good in Fleet Combat and gets fielded a lot by bigger null.sec blocks.
---
You better watch some YouTube videos and dupe around for a bit yourself.
---
If you plan on sticking to Alpha you can fly those usual newbro ships like Kestrel, Tristan etc.
---
1. EVE in general and FW in particular is not designed for solo playing.

---
Well the thing about stellar bodies is they are typically a compounded mass of random particles that slip and vibrate into place forming a sphere versus a ship which would be framed to the design... think of the grand canyon over time or something versus a steel structure. Of course you would account for this and add additional structural reinforcement the further you get away from the centroid which is essentially what you stated in your above  comment I think, thus leading me to believe I typed up all this for nothing.

Yes for the most part you can do harder sites, but you can also just do sites faster. There's a balance to the latter though since a RS doesn't warp as fast as a VNI, meaning faster site completion doesn't scale linearly with faster isk since you spend a bit more time between them.
---
You're also risking a LOT more on the field, have to be more focused on what you're doing, putting yourself more at risk of not noticing a hostile in local, and in a ship that is drastically slower to warp off when hostiles show up. You do get MJD though so you can at least escape if you're not scramed.

And Titans.

Also Dreads and Marauders for people who hate themselves and their wallets.

Volumes in product history are completed transactions. High, low, and average are based on actually completed orders. Otherwise low would be 0.01ISK and highs would be like a trillion ISK on every single product, because of speculative high- and lowballs hoping to catch people fucking up
---
Alphas are no longer locked to a single faction ***but*** ... They have only 5 mil Sp total of free SP, 20 mil with injectors, so if you spread yourself too thin, you will inadvertantly accidentally fuck yourself if all you wanna do is stay alpha.
---
My recommendation is to have both. Why not they are free alphas. IMHO Caldari is better for PvE and onbviously for trading cause you start off with and have easier access to Caldari Navy for Jita 4-4. This does come into play a bit, especially the PvE part for getting some base income. 
---
Amarr got a little better, but is still behind in this regard. On the flipside, I like Amarr ships much better for PvP, especially pirate faction which are mixed Amarr + whatever else depending on faction and SOE ships for some explo. I happen to like Astero and Stratios.

&gt;2. How do you set your turrets to keep firing at the next target after the current one is destroyed?
---
There is also Karmafleet, goon newbie corp and Pandemic Horde. If you are looking for more PvE / farming stuff, join Karmafleet. If you are looking for more PvP action where you can often jump in and jump out of the game, join Pandemic Horde.
---
Whats the downside of having a dead dictor on your killboard?
---
lore-wise, sansha uses jove tech (among other things) too so that wouldn't be the easiest fight anyway

sansha incursions are sansha using a wormhole generator to invade empire space

he's streets ahead of basically anybody other than drifters and concord
---
&gt;play casually (an hour a day) other times and still make progress?
---
No.
---
There are some activities such as recent Abyssal space, or missions which you can do in roughly an hour, but unless you do X hours of them progress will seem insignificant and very slow. Eve is a very slow and at times grindy game.
---
that's how ccp designed them
---
too bad there's no way to set the price tag high enough to keep players from just grinding out the isk/materials for something if it's useful enough to have
---
the reason there isn't a palatine yet isn't because it's too costly, it's because there's no real benefit to it. that said, i bet there's a goon somewhere in delve silently stashing away PI materials so he can drop a palatine in his krab system and post a thread about it one day

---
&gt;How much of Eve is accessible for F2P-ers?
---
Honestly it kinda sucks, but its enough to keep new players busy for a few months until they realize how much of the game is locked out to them via lack of ships / modules, more importantly, how much better the stuff they are doing on F2P mode is done on Omega mode. It is good at first while everything is still new and shiny, but once it all sets in it sucks major ass.
---
Sounds like you guys are having a great time!
---
That's really not how this works. You have them to defend the hole. Usually on alts because capitals on your main is indicative of a lack of sp and null brain
---
so true bro, so true
---
Um actually they had the Guristas podhunter skins on sale this week. 
---
Very ungrateful of you to claim there was no event!
---
Marauders in siege mode and capital ships have very heavy EWAR resistances. It is a part ofwhat creates sub cap / cap imbalance in the game. Also you will find that if you have low EWAR skills, some pilots will be resistant to you due to their ships sensor strength as well as certain skills that give them some more resistance. Later on, if you fit a dedicated EWAR ship with some additional strength modules or rigs and have a max skileld character it will become much more effective.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
&gt;o all Alpha available skills fit within the 5mill limit?
---
Hell no. You can't even cover the basics with that, not even the very basics necessary for almost everything. Check this list  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)  its called the magic 14.

the empire factions, in lore, have iapetan titans, which are substantially larger and more powerful than capsuleer titans
---
they were used in the wars prior to eve online the game, but since the advent of concord there's been a relative peace between the empires, and they've been keeping them hidden in deep space, since they require a ton of resources to operate and also they're big enough to fuck with the tides and stuff on planets if you keep them near planets

I loged on this morining for the ops today and for some reason i was removed form my corp in spec, it seems like one of the leaders went on a kicking spree and removed half the people....

this can also lead to XSS attacks. All inputs coming from forms should be escaped from weird characters

As I said it's three things and your average spodbrain can only count one, two and many.

The only time i won something on twitch stream is when i consistently watch ertschlag doing escalations in drone regions. One sentient sensor booster and some electronic attack ship (forgot its name, it's that long time). Since few days there is one guy streaming USTZ i think, with his inventory window open (65+ bil worth of ships in the hangar, plus lots of rare skins, etc) and he gives random stuff to random players. So far i didn't get anything, because this means i shouldn't sleep when he streams, but i've seen a guy getting stuff multiple times (one thanatos was also given) and he had a special icon near his nick (i guess subscriber or donator, didn't check), later, this guy also donated 5$ multiple times..

As someone who has the hobby of digital archivist, I honestly *love* that people are so passionate about something super niche, like Eve Online, that they are willing to state what is on their mind, despite rules violations, and that the entities that control these platforms, like CCP, simply just close a forum rather than delete it.
---
Alternatively, Im super intoxicated, so maybe Im not coherent and read too much into your reply. I apologize or whatever.
---
i agree. is WARFARE, ment to defend plexes, attack them, getting contested systems to your faction , get LP out of it, make money and stuff. most of the time what i see on twitch , solo pvpers in lowsec, they just roam around, go to plexes just to find a fight. i've never see ONE actually playing the mechanics of FW.
---
What exactly is this conflict, where and what over?

Aw. He loves tristans. Must be a fine guy :D

i will check that, as soon is i can, thx for your input!

Just wondering how come Amarr are not used in a lot of the doctrines? I‚Äôve been shying away from the Amarr ships because when I started people said they weren‚Äôt beginner friendly ships due to cap managment and stuff, but they‚Äôre by far my favorite looking ships in the game..

You have 7 different types of PVE activities but only list "PVP" and "Faction Warfare" for PVP activities. Consider adding "Supercaps" and "Small Gang" at a minimum, possibly also "Ganking".

---
CONCORD is only allowed to use most of their tech against capsuleers since that's also Jove tech. I'm guessing there's some detail there that prevents them from directly intervening in the incursions and other CONCORD sponsored things.

We wardecced a three man Corp, turned out to be a Razor alt Corp, we apologized, they did not.

Luminaire is the system that contains the homeworld of both the Caldari and Gallente. During one of the earlier wars the Gallente kicked out the Caldari. The Luminaire situation was when the Caldari were threatening to come take back Caldari Prime and the Gallente were bringing in basically everything. From the lore, at one point at least, the Gallente had far more than just a few Solteurs. Same with the Amarr it seems. Not sure how many the Caldari or Minmatar have/had though.

could you please give it another try?

i tried that out in the beginning, but there's no API provided by CCP for retrieving corp adverts :(

Adorable newbies are one of the reasons I still play. Friendship is best ship (Tristan is pretty dope too)
---
hmm, i will add  a "Timezone" filter pretty soon, your advice won't work then ...  
---
but i could spit it up into 2 columns then?
---
is that gobbins gf?
---
With more added options, collapsing menu is probably the way to go. But up to you!
---
The main reason why I'd recommend it is purely because some people might think it's active filtering, and hit it and wonder why nothing happens (because they don't see the filter button).
---
After reading your CSM manifesto, forum post and now this Mr. Naari all I can say is what you‚Äôve said is one of the most insanely idiotic  things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent  ramblings were you even close to anything that could be considered a  rational thought. Everyone in this forum is now dumber for having  listened to it. I award you no plex, and may Bob have mercy on your  soul.

This is a very nice site you've made. Thank you.

A whiny post by a person who have very little experience playing EVE.

---
Although the story of your newbie pilot hit me someplace in my cold rotten heart, it kinda sounds like you deserved it then to be honest. You thought you could prey on a tiny fish and ended up with a lot bigger fish instead. *Ab igne ignem.*
---
Hisec is only difficult for older players who want to transport very high value and high volume stuff in max cargo fit freighters and other ships.
---
New players don't have the wealth to entice gankers and if you're mining in hisec and CODE. ganks you, you really need a more worthwile activity for your time.
---
Character transfers... Which unfortunately costs I think 15$ US per character.
---
"Due to the fact that around half of eve's potential population consists of players that do not want to engage in pvp content"  
---
Citation needed.  
---
And no, you can't say half of the population in eve don't want to engage in pvp content because half of the population in WoW don't want to
---
Character transfers or just giving him the account. As long as he isn't paying you for it I believe you are safe! Best of luck with the new adventures!
---
You are Streaming about a Week just doing giveaways, sometimes you undock for some mins....
---
You claim that you need to follow to get into the giveaway game and you write that if you talk in chat your chances are higher to win.
---
That are all things (Follower, Chat Messages) points to get partnered for twitch.
---
And thats pretty lame.

You have no idea what you are talking about(both not even knowing what the Gila nerf is and your long busted Tiger vs Shermans myth) but decide to complain and blame other people for it anyways...

Good job OP :clap:
---
Disney wars is trash.
---
if u recently joined fw there is a known bug that does'nt let u capture sites until the next downtime, its probably fixed by now
---
I haven't tried characyer transfers since before they "temporarily disabled " pay with plex for character transfers but word was you could stii petition the gms and they'd substract the plex from your account and transfer the character without needing to pay cash.
---
You're never truly done with eve, you will come back one day. Sell all your assets, buy as many plex as you can afford and just leave. When you come back you most likely have more isk than you have now or at least plenty gametime.
---
Not this.  Giving your account requires sharing the password, and the TOS frowns on that.
---
To be on the right side of the eula i'd suggest extracting and selling the character's sp and giving the isk to your friend.
---
Hi all, 
---
I just reinstalled EVE today after a long absence and found that I have been kicked out of the Corp I was I'm due to inactivity. 
---
My problem is that I had a lot of my assets stored in the Corps player made base and no longer get access. 
---
I read that there is a way to get my items sent to another base but I cannot figure it out.
---
Do I get to select where I want my stuff to go? 
---
Any info would be appreciated
---
1. Transfer your characters to your friends account.
---
Or
---
2. Use the isk to extract skills and transfer the skills to your friend.
---
P. S. Can I be your friend?
---
I‚Äôve got two questions. 
---
First is how can I learn to fit ships, I‚Äôm 3-4 months in and till now I‚Äôve been stealing people‚Äôs fits and I‚Äôm just overwhelmed by the amount of mods there is. It seems that certain mods are generally used a lot more than others, but other than to balance resists I‚Äôm not too sure on things I should be focusing on... I‚Äôve got pyfa, but I need a direction on how to start practicing with fits so I can get the hang of it.
---
Second question is about station trading mainly as it seems safer as in I won‚Äôt get ganked going station to station or supplying Null hubs. I suppose I really need to be familiar with items and pay attention to news and changes, as of now I have invested into crystalline isogen, which I bought at a rather cheap price since the new Triglavian ships are coming out soon and the price has been going up. But I would really appreciate some more trading tips as well
---
Not if you infiltrated that country with the sole purpose of spying on it.
---
I‚Äôm going to have to disagree here. Depending on what your goals are in eve you can definitely make progress and have fun in an hour. 
---
Want to shoot people in FW? You can do that in an hour, rat in null-sec? You can do it in less than an hour: industry, Abyssal sites, ratting, trading, solo pvp and missions can all be done to some extent in an hour or less. 
---
Depending on your play-style, an hour can be plenty of time for a quick session.
---
You could say that, yes we bit off more than we could chew. However we specialize in mostly removing dead structures from highsec, the system in question was blanketed from end to end with the blasted things. We are doing a service to help unclutter overviews and give newbies a shot at learning PvP ropes before moving on to bigger and better things.
---
Oh well, apparently "git gud" is the go-to response to anything posted here these days.

:mocking spongebob:
---
If you want to PvP you should want to go into busy systems, and not rat¬¥s arse dead systems in the middle of nowhere that have 2 people in them. It is completely against common sense.
---
But I assume you yourself don't care since you fly gimmicky ventures and cant get pointed on the gate.
---
I would strongly recommend keeping your main intact for just-in-case. You can sell/extract rest of your toons, give the bulk to your friend, do a jita giveaway or host a competition in your corp with grand prizes. o7 and good luck, mate.
---
Why would you play the mechanics of FW when you efficiently blue up one half of the content?
---
CCP stoped their events because they totaly messed up with the last one. It was so obvious that they did not even send a survey by mail like all other previous events.
---
That is a shame, because the previous with the mordus legion was on a good path of was could be a good event with many things to do and something unique ( even considering this event was not flawless ).
---
Got em
---
Can I be your friend too? I‚Äôm a good friend haha.
---
But honestly In the past I had left games that I have invested loads of time into, just to find myself keep coming back. I really think you will regret your decision eventually, imagine Eve changes for the better one day and comes back to life, like the good old days? - I wouldn‚Äôt know btw I‚Äôve been playing for a few months lol.
---
My point is just keep your account for now, spare your friend some isk but hold onto your characters. You could liquidize all your items into isk, extract all your alts, keep/sell the injectors and buy plex with all the isk that you have, so eventually if you end up coming back you will be sitting on a fat pile of isk waiting for you to welp it.
---
Sorry, minds playing tricks on me. Not sure why I got the impression it was a wormhole, still sounds like rare amount of fun hahaha

CCPlease add an endpoint to ESI with ALL active corp adverts. In game search sucks !

Except the captain‚Äôs size.
---
plexing is very borring and not stream material, eve allready has a very low watching comunity on streaming platforms so if the content is borring nobody will watch, that being said of course a lot of people plex unironically when they dont stream
---
BFGs ?
---
Best Friend Generators ?
---
As a former member of brave back in glorious days of fade i can tell you that brave is currently completely shit for pvp content unless you are an f1 monkey. Instead i would urge you to take a stroll down around amamake and partake in plentiful content available. And dont listen to people saying fw lowsec is dead, these are turds that fly around in decked out pirate frigs such as garmur or worm and then wonder why they cant get any fites or they get blobbed flying their bs or bc in wrong system/timezone. Get to learn the locals and how they operate, fly ships that are engageable and you will find plenty of content within minutes of roaming around amamake.
---
At that point it felt like a troll post but then again there are people out there that wants to make high sec really safe. None of this gankimg or war dec on high sec stuff.
---
Nobody saw a Iapetan Titan since the hijack of the Gallente Iapetan Molyneux, by Saarpati Serpentis (it‚Äôs been a while, I think Battleships were the biggest ships for capsuleers at that time).
---
The thing had apparently supersmartbombs that could easily wreck a battleship... and had a 200km range &gt;.&lt;
---
But I‚Äôd love to see one with today graphical technology.
---
I'd like to see where they docked that bad boy.
---
^(probably in the sun...sneaky serpentis)
---
I've been down this road already, still solid advice though.
---
The one that wrecked a Revelation on the Sotiyo ?
---
In Brave I usually chill in standing fleet and get into decent little brawls once in a while. Before that I was in goons for about two weeks and definitely felt like an F1 monkey, that is if I even got the chance to lock and press F1 before the other 200 people, lol. 
---
But anyway, I really appreciate the advice I‚Äôll check out amamake, I hope you‚Äôre not just leading me there so you can slap around a newbro hahahahahaha
---
CONCORD only operates in the various empires' space - it doesn't have jurisdiction in null, hence why capsuleers get bounty payments.
---
Extract your SP and send your assets to me bro
---
TheCorrupted has a 400 mil Vagabond that can even do tier 5 sites, you can find the fit in the eve_tc channel
---
Thanks
---
Hello, Friend!
---
New player here so forgive my ignorance but how can you have a war in highsec? Doesn‚Äôt Concord get involved? Suddenly I feel even less safe.
---
Assets in an NPC station, depending on your level of gullibility
---
At least allow me to have some of your stuff
---
Sincerely
---
Hold up. Someone stole the  fortizar fitting? Or all of the ships  in them?
---
Boson Field Generators...
---
Or Big Friendly Giants, if you're into that stuff.
---
Oh...
---
*sad beep*
---
The Languges filter de-selects itself again after I press search.
---
A link from the corp to zkillboard would be nice.
---
&gt;n plasma drive, we have many orca‚Äôs, and so it was fitting that we‚Äôd  name our first station sea world. It was part of our culture to name our  members orca‚Äôs, our friends dolphins, or enemies sharks (or seagulls),  spies were cleverly named ‚Äúmimic octopus‚Äôs‚Äù (if they were good spies) or  ‚Äúspy clams‚Äù (if they were bad spies).
---
And people are taking this seriously?
---
You can use the war declaration system as long as the corp you're war deccing has a structure. This lets you freely kill anyone in that corp without CONCORD intervention or security status loss.
---
Great idea, hope it succeeds. 
---
One thing I hated about eve corp finder that every corp in eve would tick ALL the boxes, hoping they turn out in every kind of search rendering the thing itself completely useless.
---
I know it is a lot of work but I had a similar idea before maybe you can implement it somehow is to use zkill data to automatically decide what kind of corp (low-sec, null or J) and what TZ it actually has based on kills and corp members activity not what the CEO would like you to "believe" they have 3 active tzs when they barely have one.
---
Looks good, one small bug: you spelt the id of the English filter checkbox wrong and as such the label does not propogate clicks to it.
---
So once a war is declared, no space is safe? That‚Äôs really cool.
---
Good, they are in the system next to Cloud Ring and INIT area. I will hang around there and hunt them down
---
I know Thieves' Guild armor when I see it, you're not fooling anybody.
---
You know you're good at EVE when people have to make posts about how they were forced to not engage
---
What about the 50 goon excavators bombed in Fountain? Mining ops are pricey yo!
---
Busted how?
---
I just tried this fit on the test server i couldent hit anything. All skills are at max i need more tracking
---
You know you're good at EVE when salty Russians are commenting nonsensical sentences at your dank posts.
---
So it's just happenstance that so many product knockoffs and counterfeits come from China as well then?
---
/r/yoyhammer
---
You have it backwards. Because CONCORD has to keep helping those newbie ships or else Jove will come back\[1\] and yank their ability to do anything about capsuleers they don't have time to do more useful things. 
---
\[1\] or more realiticly, jove built automation will do it.
---
I deem u can invite him to your corp if u need this content
---
I thought NC disbanded  like years ago they've been so quiet...
---
Please no. Capitals are already a terrible thing, don't need  super-supercapitals to wreck this game even further beyond repair.
---
I would extract everything and put all your loot inside a jump freighter then run it across space on autopilot
---
Dun' broke.  Good work tho.
---
one in a C3  one year back ?
---
That's not a side by side comparison, the Erebus is far away, the Soltueur is closer. It would be the same as saying the moon and sun are the same size because they overlap during a solar eclipse.
---
Not to give them to players, but as an NPC event asset to play around. Maybe have devs pilot them.
---
Damn I should have done a Reddit post when a dude was bashing the drifter on a astrahus and I managed to steal the 300mIsk blue loot
---
hmm, i could limitate the amount of checkable boxes per group, that would be less work :D
---
Set up skill queues for remaining time, and just unsub? It seems like people tend to come back, which the comments say you've already done. If that doesn't happen after a while, gift it to a friend, or someone you knew who had a positive impact on you.

Worst is, that he died to rats...

Must have been one hell of a can.
---
Why would you even put them in to your ships cargo
---
ALL HAIL LAGMASTER115
---
Well, as I don't have a lot of technical knowledge in this field, I just take what you say is true. But it does not matter to my argument.
---
So, why did they not run their 100 bots already before? They would have earned more $.
---
Thus, either they already used the max number of bots before, then they will now earn less after the changes.
---
Or, they were not maximizing their profits before, then, I don't know, they are simply stupid.

You kidding right? Soon 2020 and still can't have this tech, and shitting on Star citizen?
---
You guys are fun to see, great kind of haters. I'm a believer, in Star citizen's project. But I believe EvE will die, and SC will be welcomed by many players. It takes the time required, and I'll have it on EvE. With a such elitist community, but well..

Lifetime gamer. Loved Eve but now that I‚Äôm 30 and working I just don‚Äôt have time for the grind at the PC.
---
Also now in a serious relationship and play games with my girlfriend, mobile is just what works for us. She was never a gamer before we started dating, finally found one she likes and if you can believe it was a MOBA, Vainglory. Now she wants to play all the time and I‚Äôm thrilled. I think if she likes a serious genera like a MOBA then she might be into a real MMO also. She likes the PvP ;)
---
I‚Äôm super excited about the potential of Eve Echos. Can‚Äôt understand at all why people feel like you are shilling for CCP. They just aren‚Äôt at a point in their life where the prospect of an actually good mobile game are super exciting. If you‚Äôve tried as hard as I have to find a true mobile MMO experience of any kind, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve found out that none exist. 
---
OP, have you found any games you and your girl play to fill the void until Eve Echos comes out? I‚Äôm looking forward to Diablo Immortal also...
---
They act like they fear that PIBC will take it to the next level. There is no reason to believe that the PIBC culture has changed, and they've shown that they are willing to do anything to win. Coalition leaderships would do well to keep that in mind going forward.

Unreal that you are getting downvoted for comments like this. Kids on Reddit need to grow the fuck up.

&gt;that's how ccp designed them  
---
&gt;too bad there's no way to set the price tag high enough to keep players from just grinding out the isk/materials for something if it's useful enough to have
---
Maybe CCP should have made some kind of control from at the Titan BPO level back then. Maybe only BPCs can be used to build and something like the BPC invention method in which the BPC states get randomly impacted.
---
thou its water under the bridge now...
---
I just tried it with a drop booster and it worked :)
---
Could not possibly agree with this more.

The most dangerous spawn to your drones is the battlecruiser spawn. They murder even geckos mercilessly. To handle those spawns kill the frigate drones first. Then orbit the gate @ 2.5 km, set speed to 1000 m/s roughly. Make sure you can see tags in space and watch the overview. Fire guns on a battlecruiser first to pull aggro onto yourself. Then deploy drones and have them attack the same battlecruiser.

That fit should handle tier 4 electrical + exotic sites no problem. If you want to run firestorm or gamma get faction DDA. As you need the extra dps to take out all the extra buffer for the shield or armor. Because if you get massive spawns in all 3 rooms and want to finish the site on time you need that extra dps. Personally though i'd avoid gamma sites as triglavian spawns hurt.
---
Guns on that ship are mainly to just shoot the cache but can help a little with high tracking ammo to kill npc. 
---
I use 2 geckos + 1 navy wasp usually to kill stuff. As they have lots of speed, good tracking and a large shield buffer so you have plenty of time to pull them in if taking massive damage.
---
In electrical sites the worst spawns are the massive drone spawns. If you see lots of drones with spark in their name (EM damage) kite them and go orbit a pylon @ 2.5km that does area of affect damage. The pylon will kill all the drones of for you super fast. You're drones should be safe as they have plenty of buffer.

The most dangerous spawn to your drones is the battlecruiser spawn. They murder even geckos mercilessly. To handle those spawns kill the firgate drones first. Then orbit the gate @ 2.5 km, set speed to 1000 m/s roughly. Make sure you can see tags in space and watch the overview. Fire guns on a battlecruiser first to pull aggro onto yourself. Then deploy drones and have them attack the same battlecruiser. 
---
As soon as a battlecruiser yellow boxes you pull drones in and then redeploy them to attack. As that means they are about to fuck up your drones.  BTW you reason you set speed to 1000m/s is so you can pull the drones in faster. instead of them having to chase you.
---
Most dangerous ship in the sites to you is the drifter battleship. Kill off any webbing ships immediately (drifter cruisers to). Then the generic repair ships then the drifter battleship. Always keep up your transversal speed when a drifter bs is on grid. You can actually do this by orbiting the gate @ 2.5km. If you take a huge smashing hit overheat invul and shield booster for a cycle or two.
---
Leshack spawns are super easy just stay 60 km away if they are all starving and let your drones kill them. Otherwise go for the renewing first as they rep hard.
---
Anyway you should be able to do 4/5 sites an hour and if you loot all the extraction heads make around 200+ mill isk per hour on current market prices.
---
Pro tip: If you have a citadel with jump cloning services, you can take standard blue pill to be extra safe. Just jump clone in station to a second pod to get rid of any bad side affects you do not want.  
---
Pro tip2: Use a mobile tractor beam  to help pull in wrecks and lot things.
---
Pro tip3:  When there's massive spawns orbit something (mobile tractor maybe).  If you kite all the time it will take your drones longer to kill stuff and npc spread out. When you orbit they still chase you though and stay in a nice ring and your drones can switch from one target top another no problem.
---
Pro tip4: Always watch your drones and rotate them out. So if they get low on shield deploy the ones with full shield and let the other repair their shield in your drone bay. 
---
Pro tip5: Don't be greedy, if sites are taking unusually longer than normal for some reason screw the extraction heads never forget you're on the clock.
---
60 km is 37.28 miles

How far Razer fell. I swear every time I see them pop up they somehow even further in the dumpster.
---
lets talk about ehonour and ehonour-related  paraphernalia
---
that volume doesnt make sense with the size of the titan.
---
&gt;how can I learn to fit ships,
---
Unfortunately this is one of those skills that can't really be taught or explained. It sounds like you're on the right track - play with pyfa, look at other people's fits and try to figure out why they're fit the way they are. Try to improve their fits. You'll get the hang of all the modules eventually, but it does take a long time, and a lot of effort. For example, I have 125 of my own Loki fits in pyfa - almost all of them are dogshit. 
---
Be persistent - every time someone links a fit somewhere, import it into pyfa and try to learn something from it. Sometimes, it'll be something crazy like, "you can fit a 500MN on a myrmidon", other times it's gonna be more subtle like "he's using nano plating instead of an ENAM because he lacks CPU". 
---
Some rules and patterns will eventually emerge, such as "almost all solo/small gang fits need a cource of cap other than their base regen", or "never dual-tank", or "sometimes, an undersized cap booster is ok". Just keep at it and you'll do fine. Not for a long time, but eventually.
---
Is there anything that prevents you from installing two warp core stabilizers?
---
20 dps mining frig is now "gimmicky" lmao
---
P.S. If you want PvP don't complain about being killed in PvP
---
Go to your assets window - it'll list all your items across the galaxy, sorted into various stations. If it's in a structure (player structure, not NPC station), you can right click on the structure's name, and select "move items to asset safety". 
---
They'll be unavailable for a few weeks, after that you can claim them from (I think) the nearest lowsec NPC station. I think there might be some way for you to select where they go, but I've never used this feature personally so hopefully someone else knows.
---
I'm not sure why people think Amarr ships are under-used. Guardians are the gold standard (literally) for armor logistics, Abaddons are used in nullsec slug-fests, Bhaalgorns are incredibly powerful, although not strictly Amarr, the Retribution is one of the best frigates in the game for a variety of roles, Legions are useful in a variety of roles as well, Oracles are straight-up overpowered in a lot of ways, Maledictions are the best interceptor, I could go on... Amarr ships are powerful and see plenty of use.
---
But you still didn‚Äôt kick the thief and that cost you another billion.
---
&gt;Is there anything that prevents you from installing two warp core stabilizers?
---
Yes, the plex gates won't let you in.
---
Tru. Totally forgot about it.

&gt; "Contrary to what some people think, a lot of new people join EVE Online every week," he said. "Every week we have about 10,000 people that log into EVE Online for the first time.
---
If you're running a business where you've got 10,000 new people trying it each week, and still your simultaneous counts are going down, and your multiboxers are going up, you should be shitting yourselves.

Seems working now, back when it only had one group, I clicked and there was a code error, looked like bad db request or something.  Seems fine now.

Could you add a category for "Newbie friendly" or "accepting newbies" or "newbie guild" or something?  Thanks.

An Announcement from Thieves Guild re this; 
---
Some of you may be aware that the covert arm of the Thieves Guild, the Hand has carried out a an operation against AIC the Spectrum lead Corp.
---
This action was a well considered revenge Operation for actions taken by AIC leadership against one of our allies, this action led to billions in losses for our ally.
---
We have inflicted the same losses on AIC. This operation was not aligned with RAZOR, we were not paid but we did extract around 10bn.
---
Tim is and will claim that this was an attempt to destroy Spectrum. On the contrary this was a warning shot and wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without his own mismanagement. 
---
The Thieves Guild can and will hurt corporations without military assets and will continue to do so if they act against any of our allies.
---
I know this is a conflict of interest for some of you, and there will be no hard feelings if this organisation is not going in the direction you would have liked.
---
I feel like if CCP had used 50% of the time they spent talking about this towards actually doing it they would have already been done.
---
&gt;Both faltered for different reasons, and the recent decision to stop production of a new first-person shooter, Project Nova, has only reinforced the idea that EVE's idiosyncrasies make it a uniquely difficult game to interpret in other forms.
---
Didnt CCP recently say it wasnt cancelled? Is it? Isnt it? Much confusing. wow.
---
Thats actually cool you kept it going so long. I cant imagine what it feels like to constantly double agent like spys do in this game, like i play eve to relax so the paranoia and subterfuge must be hard
---
You should try bigger marks up then some isk here and there and some rorqs, you couldve made bank off goons maybe
---
Disconnected? But even then you should e-warp. It's pretty much impossible to understand how this could happen.
---
WHers honorable lol. They always bring kitey non-fighting doctrines in my experience
---
Yeah same, been solo pvping since 2 or 3 weeks, at start I was mad at everything because I wasn't strong or skilled or acknowledged enough to fight others, but then I improved in every aspect and now I accept everything. People on this subreddit cries too much about everything, I'm an eve player and I don't even see all the issues this subreddit highlights, people here should spend more time playing and less time complaining. Lately I'm also enjoying fighting solo against blobs
---
HAIL ME
---
Super-quitting maybe? Extract all skills then suicide with the injectors on board so there's no isk or decent character to tempt him back.
---
That or twelve too many rums...
---
I'm about to get into doing some blob fighting as well. Only, I want to do it in a HAW Dread in null. Should be fun as well. Welp some big stuff.
---
well that might be. as i have no test environment all the development happens in production :D
---
It's obvious that he jumped gate and then got distracted by his dad beating him with jumper cables. Really a classic situation.
---
Create an upkeep system. Make titan a liability to an alliance. Tie titan existence to solar system ownership. I believe there are much more unexplored design solutions and there may even be some good ones, but their time is long over, such rebalance will cause a massive (and somewhat justified) outcry.
---
That's funny too, I just created another account last week too. Feels kinda cool to be part of the 10,000 "new people".
---
Can you break down Nullsec into two subgroups- Sov and NPC? And wormholes into Highclass (C5-6) and low class (C1-C4)? Lowsec into FW and Pirate?
---
Otherwise, awesome stuff man, really appreciate the effort.
---
I've been through that myself, been trying to quit for a couple of years. For me the issue was being so detached from my characters as I had so many, and everything being so easy because I had too much isk resulting in everything becoming meaningless. And part of a large established alliance meaning there wasn't really any risk involved nor did I have to put in any active effort.
---
For me the solution was to ditch it all, leave it all behind and start completely anew. ONE account, no affiliation with my old alliance (or any alliance for that matter), NOT use a silly amount of skill injectors (just enough to avoid the boring skills like AWU, fitting and cap skills at 5). Play in a different way with different goals. 
---
My isk making character is pretty much done and makes some 200-500 mil a day by doing something I actually ENJOY doing. It's more than enough as I don't really CARE about isk, my expenses will be non-expensive pvp frigs, cruisers and BC, doing it solo or with a small group of folks I may run in to.
---
I'm also helping out newer players in several ways, many of them will be alts of course but oh well. In short, what saved EVE for me is making it more PERSONAL, so you can actually invest in your character, your choices and the people you meet.
---
Yeah the whole point of plexes is to create a 'fair' fight - not as in 1v1 but as in ship class. When you could slide them they achieved that (and I almost never saw an out-of-class camper). You can't even create a perch and then warp down, because the gates are deadspace so you can't warp to your perch (and this also enables turbocancer like having a blap carrier 800km off the gate).
---
"Simple" suggestion: the gate will tether you (Upwell mechanics, so you drop tether if you lock anything) within 10km if your ship is of the appropriate class.
---
You implying that gilas were nerfed because of pvp really shows that you have no idea about the game. No major group used Gilas and they weren't very common in small-gang either. They're 100% a PVE boat. So it's not about "finding a way around" it.
---
This is because of CCP's ass backwards "are you sure" dialogues. If you ever selected no to the "are you sure you want to kick this person" and also checked the "do not ask me again" option, it will always default to no whenever you try to kick someone.
---
Reset your suppressed message settings (esc &gt; reset settings) and it will work again.
---
Confirmed.Lost connection. Nothing more
---
Have you actually submitted a big report which ccp will read?
---
Sweet. Good work. o7
---
they don't count when you make "another" account.
---
Its 10k new people, which makes the whole situation a whole lot worse. The new bro experience in EVE is totally shit
---
The government already has that capability. This is more about keeping the internet running in Russia, in case crazies in USA decide to cut it off or disrupt it.
---
Gates are fine. 
---
CCPlease don't let daytripping nullseccers influence lowsec mechanics.
---
Nothing should be safe.
---
Traps and bait is viable tactics.
---
And if you want to fly solo then you should find ways to get around that, like taking notes of names.
---

As far as I know CONCORD is protecting the populace during incursions, letting capsuleers destroy the Sansha's in space.

Don't give them away. Keep them for when you want to dip in and play a bit of casual eve. You can take time away from Eve and use it IRL without completely severing everything Eve from your life.
---
I specifically liked the part where he basically blames the player base for having 6k people fights because CCP didn‚Äôt design it that way.

yea they are only counting the mass migration off of serenity because its stale, boring, and the economy is ruined. But hey gotta suck that east asian dick for that sweet micro-transaction culture.

No, a rando journalist said it was cancelled and then denied by CCP.
---
Dude, this is way less offensive than your name alone. Get a life and stop smearing people on Reddit.
---
Rmt that goes wrong
---
That sounds like the Anthem "fix" when for a single weekend the game was actually fun until it got fixed to bad again xD
---
well, i guess you can actually discuss this with the GMs. doing it silently will be bad. but if you are transparent with it, it will work
---
That was a really fun fight that went better than expected :P
---
When nobody give a shit about this story ;)
---
propbably he already got it activted or he isnt playing the game anymore.
---

Bait alt. Sit on Stargate, wait for roamers to jump you, alert friendlies what they're flying and where they're going so they can avoid or drop as desired.

My guess is to give content to horde.

Where is this stuff from?

Sorry I missed this so a rather belated o7 from this wormholer
---
Your enemies in abyssal sites are mostly armor focused thats why you would have the edge in gamma sites. On the other side, the molten or firestorm sites or however they are called are some of the most difficult because they favor the tanking of the rats in there. I already did several of t4 and t5 gamma sites with a passive tanked gila and its really not a big problem if you get to around 700-800 dps with your skills. You what should not forget is that in higher tiers you have to speed/sig tank as well and cant just run straight at the enemy anymore.
---
He's making money on Twitch platform using CCP in-game items. This is like selling chinese products on Amazon . Almost.
---
&gt; Create an upkeep system.
---
you mean like fuel?
---
&gt;Make titan a liability to an alliance.
---
they are :eyes:
---
&gt;Tie titan existence to solar system ownership.
---
will be gamed by larger entities to their advantage just like every other limiting mechanic the game has ever had
---
there are two problems with any possible balance solution to limit the number of titans in eve
---
1. there are too many titans in eve already for it to be practical, and  
---
2. as long as titans are as useful as they are now (only relevant ship in bloc-scale conflict for 10 years running), eve players will find a way to get more of them in spite of whatever arbitrary limits you set
---
Pretty sure this post is his reason.  Congrats you made it happen  üéâ
---
Regarding the point made in the comment above:
---
&gt;IRL Shermans were crap against Tigers, but Shermans won with superior numbers and tactics..admittedly with heavy losses.
---
The imagine of Tigers cutting through waves of Shermans is already wrong based on the simple fact that encounters between American Shermans and Tiger tanks were incredibly rare. American tankers in the heat of battle often misidentified Panzer IVs and Panthers, leading to much inflated numbers([examples here](https://www.quora.com/How-often-did-American-forces-face-German-Tiger-tanks-in-battle)). No completely verifiable numbers exist, and while some sources argue with as low as 3 or 4 encounters having ever happened, the numbers might be somewhere between that and the estimated amount of a total of only 60-80 Tigers beeing present at the western front, with a large amount of those having been destroyed by allied air superiority, AT guns, broken down, having run out of fuel, and so on(examples in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/39hrif/apparently_us_tankers_encountered_tiger_tanks/cs3ofmx/) comment thread with some sources). (Additional note: The myth of 5 Shermans for 1 Tigers seems to have originated from the fact that 5 Shermans were the smallest size of unit that the Americans deployed them in.)
---
Speaking more generally, the myth of the Tiger beeing a wonderweapon of German engineering(overweight, underpowered, unreliable, a nightmare to repair and maintain, had to be loaded onto trains for every single move over longer distances[for which you also had to remove its regular tracks and fit special "Transportketten" due to beeing oversized], expensive and difficult to manufacture, etc.) and vice versa the Sherman beeing a bad tank(vertically gyro stabilizied gun, high quality radio set, HVAP and white phosphorous ammunitions, good crew ergonomics and survival rates, ease of repair, etc.) has probably been debunked hundreds of time already, so I won't bring up all of these again but end it with the mother of all Sherman myth busting posts, 10+ comments long(you have to click "Show replies" to show all of it) by one of the amazing folks over at /r/AskHistorians , completely with annotations and sources: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6ilw88/whats_the_worst_misconception_about_your_area_of/dj779ud/).

I've just logged in after about 12 months out of game.
---
One of my characters has 250k unallocated skillpoints, and my main has 750k unallocated skillpoints.
---
What skills have been removed from game in the last 12 months, that have caused me to accumulate these points?
---
Plex your account via in game isk making, that will burn you out and you'll end up never doing anything except turbo krabbing.
---
Except I wasn't trolling when I said I would bring order and balance to the CSM. Once elected I re-wrote the entire white paper and reformed the process as a whole, with the help of my fellow CSMs.

Ahh okay, interesting.

The "Missile Massacre" refers to Macross series, known as Macross Missile Massacre, or "Itano Circus". Signified by firing too much missile spams to take an enemy down, and the smoke trails, known as Roboteching. 
---
The first Caldari Missile Massacre is this one: https://redd.it/5flsus

The canned drink included as a missile is part of the Macross animator's Easter Egg in Do You Remember Love (DYRL), putting in a Budweiser can in one of the animation frames.

Is TAPI ok? 2019 has been rough.
---
Technically you do actually qualify since you breath during US TZ. I suspect he'd prefer players who aren't in a REM state though.
---
No he wasn't. SOMER was only banned once. He taken down for revealing communications between himself and someone from the marketing department.   
---
His original ISK laundering scheme was legal due to the provisions of the GTC (now PLEX) resellers agreement. The GTC resellers agreement was reworked due to the scandal.  
---
I should also point out that SOMER wasn't the only one using the scheme, he was just the biggest.
---
yoinked by a Jeff Taelor If I remeber correctly Don't remeber the wh class roughly 10-12 months ago (I think). Events were scrubbed from our corp discord.

You'll end up doing war crimes here and there, shooting neutrals in plexes. I'd recommend a criminal alt doing this.

TAPI and Russians killed more ships, objective won.

Was this you? Bad luck mate.

&gt;Is he seriously so fucking retarded 
---
Read some more of that thread
---
1. Search button seem to be an outdated thing - or it feels that way. I'd like the list of corp filter to be applied as soon as I tick on "Nullsec" etc.
---
2. There should be a generic message "No corp meets your criteria - lower your expectations" instead of empty list.
---
3. Landing corp search page better show all corps bellow "use the filter" message.
---
4. "Newbie friendly" corp option in filters.
---
5. Every corp should have link to dotlan or zkill for more info on member count and more since all this stuff sometimes matter.
---
6. Next to the corp logo could be alliance logo, too, as some people might not even consider joining goons, dead or tapi just because reasons. That would save some time.
---
Besides that, great job, I like the way UI feels - super clean, super fast.
---
Create alpha toon to accept donations, some people would support you for the effort, so you can get that damn Molok.
---
I agree that the new player experience is shit, but why did so many people start playing it back in 2004/2005? Because there wasn't even *anything* resembling a "NPE" - you just got your rookiefrigate, an extremely basic tutorial that told you how to navigate and target something, shoot at a drone and mine a clump of veldspar, before sending you on your way to do whatever.
---
Im interested in seeing what toons you have if you want to sell some of them (isk not rmt you nerds) just let me know. 
---
What you do with isk afterward you can decide
---
Thats why they are so focused on the new player experience.
---
Ehh, I can't completely blame CCP for this. Eve wasn't really designed for these massive coalitions to form - even alliances weren't initially in-game. And I'm kinda resentful of how these massive blocs started forming from 2007 onwards. Where before, you had multiple alliances fighting each other in a big battle royale, it kinda devolved into north vs south,  west vs east, et cetera. It's either blue up or gtfo. Not fun and not healthy for the game.
---
Like most others have said, hold onto your toons, contract your friend the assets/isk.
---
Your toons skill is worth about 350bil isk, very few people in Eve could effectively do anything with that amount of isk, and unless they have played for a while and have other toons at the same skill level, they'll jump in ships they don't properly know how to fly and be unhappy with the result (-:
---
It's great your life is headed in a better direction, and it's probably worth putting Eve down completely for a year or two, though I feel there is a health balance to be had with gaming in general and RL, give it time to settle and if you want to come back, part time, they'll be here waiting and you can jump into any RL first corp you want.
---
At the very least move the camera on faxes outside the stupid hull. Half the time the camera spawns inside the hull and I am looking out the bay window.

I'd be fine with LS being like J space. Dreads and carriers ok, supers and Titans travel only for dank kills of the idiots
---
Cheers for that mate :) and glad you enjoyed.
---
lmao stfu, the last "event" was utter garbage. but hey, maybe people got spoiled by the blood raider event last year, where faction modules were handed out like candy. gonna be hard to top that.
---
Iirc the terminology used was a "wing" of Soltueurs, which depending on what the Gallente consider to be a "wing" (especially in regard to ships this massive) could be as little as 1-2 of them.
---
Do task, get accel. Cool!
---
Do task, get BPC for accel. Need to mine the limited ore to build it.  WTF?
---
Very true, I stand corrected.
---
That is true. They should have a good tutorial and a big video explaining everything what Eve is etc when coming into the game.
---
I need a new abyssal event in my life that feeds me heaps of built accels, like the old one did.
---
Man, Frat RMT is strong and they finally have some good FCs I guess.
---
Could we get a "Roleplaying" checkbox? :)
---
ok

That's just me expanding my sp farm. Only need to log on once a month.

Looks like PGL let Fawlty have a go at feeding this time
---
Exactly why I'm putting the nail in the coffin.  I prefer games on my own terms, the excitement of always on PVP has worn thin for me.  I've been a goon for almost a couple years and I've made no friends cause I don't play enough, I mined a Titan, sold it and plexed my accounts these past several months, upgraded my Rorqual fits and now my ISK is low, but I have 4x T2 core Rorq pilots so isk isn't a problem, I could mine a plex a day easy I'm a disabled vet, 100% service connected, I don't work so I have all the time in the world to play, but I have absolutlely zero motivation or inclination to play.
---
So there ya have it, you managed to get my sob story out me anyway.
---
I can understand that it is hard for small corps to make a proper space for themselves without allies, and I can relate to how annoying that may be if you want to. However, this game is built around PvP, and giving people the ability to mine the best resources without putting themselves at risk would break the economic balance of the game.
---
Now, I do think it is wrong to destroy their assets for having an opinion though. If there truly is a lot of newer players in the corp and they have been led to believe that the OP is right, the destruction of their assets will only make them feel like martyrs and fight back even harder against the perceived injustice. Try to keep it civil to avoid everything escalating - make it a battle on words so we have a chance of changing opinions, instead of making it a battle of factions where the opinions are not being contested, and the unfair battles only makes them dig deeper trenches.
---
Tempting for comedy, but wasteful.
---

it's a disease, that's why they like to hunt in null and use cyno inhibitors and kill caps and super caps, flee when they see a fleet of subcaps, because they lived so long in WHs that now big ships and jump bridges are only in photoshop.
---
Yeh I am with you gate slide was so good man. Also all those giving you shit and that are just low key clocky loki campers scared they will lose the one way they can be "leet". :)
---
If only there is a way we can find out..
---
Very nice!
---
Would it be possible to integrate the corp history and CEO info? 
---
As someone looking for a corporation, I want to check the corporation information such as standings, history and alliances so I can browse through the available ones without needing to navigate somewhere else.
---
You can grab this info using ESI - or you could link to an existing site, that would do the job.
---
Keep up the good work.
---
they kinda burned out
---
Hey, some areas don't have good access to water. Maybe Naari doesn't have that option... üòâ
---
you mean they just count new bot, alt and throwaway accounts, which will be the vast majority of those 10k accounts.
---
TAPI: Mr. Vily I don't feel so good..
---
*If* I had a friend.  He's not, though, and I don't think he plays anymore, but I was tempted to offer it all to him for his neglected magic card collection so I could give them to my son.  I just assumed a trade would be comparable to RMT and against TOS which is why I was so vague, but I don't have enough fucks left to give it to be honest so there it is.
---
Wasn't this posted like 2 days ago?
---
RMT King Radakos buys Moracha, owns it for 36 hours before doing what Radakos does best...feeds like an idiot.
---
K, mate, if you mine but you are too bored to use isk to pvp, I think your EVE itch is gone.
---
Stop playing for a few months and see if it returns. If not, too bad, contract me your stuff and I‚Äôll have fun spending it for you.
---
I was once like you, stopped playing for a few years, returned because a friend started playing and wanted to send him some isk and ships... and I stupidly undocked... thus, fuck, I knew the fucking game got me. Fuck, I smoked since I was 15, I‚Äôm 38 and I was able to quit it 3 years ago by sheer force of will. Same with alcohol, 2 years free. 
---
EVE? I hate myself.
---
10,000 new alts and SP farms every week
---
For some reason zkill pulled it few hours ago
---
A lot of it is kids who see ‚Äúfree game‚Äù to be fair
---
The project has potentials.
---
You just need a web designer to make it more attractive
---
happened when we killed NC or HK Keepstar i can't remember. Lots of ships there owned by imperium leadership :)) It's a funny trolling method.
---
How much is a permawardec, do i get a discount?
---
This is a very good answer and something I am familiar with as a goon, but I was also in smaller corps as well.  A part of it is I'm not engaging socially, but I honestly prefer RL socialisation. Though I do appreciate how awesome online gaming is for making friends thanks to wow.

i wonder if lussy does a video on this kill
---
Duh Frt rmts isk for Titans and fcs, I personally am getting paid six figures just for being in Origin 
---

Last years Guri Hiva event was great imo. I started out doing event sites in Hi-Sec with a Cyclone, cause I was bored and felt like flying that ship. Then more and more people were bringing Rattlesnakes and winning the damage race for loot on the last 'boss'. 
---
After a while of losing to Rattlesnakes I was like 'fuck it, time to bring out the Vindicator'. I didn't lose a single damage race with the Vindi and the amount of tears I got from Rattler pilots wanting their precious 'Hivaa Saitsuo' Ballistic Control Systems was priceless! :]
---
Some of the most fun I've had in Hi-Sec actually, I really enjoyed that event. For the record I actually let people in smaller ships do their sites in peace, fuck Rattlesnake pilots though! :D
---
k
---
Solo 90% of the time even whilst in FW. If they were 100% pve they wouldn't have killmails except for cases of self defense now would they?
---
Typical Caldari, jizzing all over the place and then making an ad about it.
---
I'm fairly certain you can't use those on interceptors. He could have used an improved one, but the upgrade doesn't matter if you just want to cloak up on a safe and it's probably fitting space heavier. 
---
(I don't use cloaks very often, so it's all old-ish memories)
---
I thought about selling three of them and plexing the last for a few years...
---
kk thanks!
---
&gt; Create an upkeep system. Make titan a liability to an alliance.
---
There used to be one, being required to have either dedicated pilot or a sitter effectively costed you one viable character being subbed, and being at risk of getting stranded in hostile space if you managed to go afk without prior preparation for long enough at bad enough time.
---
Now there are Keepstars with asset safety, so there is zero risk, cost or organizational issues to owning (read: keeping stash of) titans.
---
People who do this should be banned from both twitch and Eve
---
How the fuck do you fly predictably enough that a plated low sp strat tackles your moracha

Yep. J134431, May 2018. I helped one former corpie back then to unanchor a Fortizar, 4 Athanors, 1 Azbel and he didn't listen that we should unanchor one at a time and also get some help inside to have hole control. By the time we all helped to loot everything (Fortizar and Azbel unanchored at the same time, WH was bought from 3rd party, HUNDREDS of cans flying around...), this guy came with a similar named Orca and got the Fortizar :))) it was a very funny moment on comms: "who looted the fortizar? come on guys, no jokes.." i said, who the hell to loot such thing, do you see anyone besides you in an Orca ? lol... Anyway, i think he was kicked from that corp, because the victim was very pissed off (from his own stupidity at the end) and threaten them to cloak camp them forever with a fleet.
---
Good man and good vid. Wish more people would do vids like that where everything is clear and clearly explained.
---
RIP 570 billion. Moracha are now 750 bil
---
If your interested let me know. I may be interested
---
Path dependence is a bitch. Multiboxing players are the surest stable revenue generator that the game has, so CCP feels like it needs to continue to ensure people will need and want to multibox; despite the fact that, over the long run, this is slowly killing their game.
---
Badakos strikes again
---
\&gt;  you mean like fuel?   
---
I mean like alliance-wide bill of 5B ISK per week per Titan or something.
---
\&gt;  they are :eyes:
---
Can't exactly agree on this one. 
---
On other points I agree. Yes, there are too many titans right now in EVE to change anything (and I mentioned it in my comment) and any mechanics will be gamed by EVE players with larger entities always having a huge advantage.
---
Will someone please tell zkillboard it's not a 7 million isk ship.
---
That's what is sticking out to me.  The plan was always to mine to enable PVP, and I could, but I don't.
---
That's funny dude.  I guess on the bright side at least EVE doesn't have a negative impact on your health... when used responsibly.
---
Corp advert is up
---
\&gt; But we've found out that starting another city when you already have one is not an easy thing to do.
---
Going by this analogy, they're failing at creating this *country* with another ambitious city. Not a lot of sovereign camaraderie is going to develop between two lands if you plop another governed body next to a metropolis and tell them to play together. This new partner city has to come from within, like it has in the real world... an expansion.
---
How can they accomplish this? **Open that fucking door in the Captain's Quarters**. Make this the way we expand into another realm. Send your capsuleers out with a duffle full familiar mechanics, culture, ambition, salt, vain hopes, and crushed dreams. Big brother will see this developing annex of its own people and send resources to ensure its growth is sustained because it knows, like a goddamn virus, with proper cultivation, that this city will be its binary in more spectacular growth.
---
except SP farming hasn't been profitable for quite some time now
---
Ok, I'll keep you in mind, friend.  Thanks.
---
Didn't bother to check, probably says "ur gay pwned"
---
Not if you're buying with today's prices. F*ck opportunity costs.
---
Yep, right now at current prices, if you had an SP farm where each char is perfectly mapped, with +5's in, you would be losing 0.8b per acc per year 
---
(the figure changes depending on market prices, it was a loss of over 2b last week)
---
It's against tos but CCP doesn't care unless you're account sharing in order to do something else shady.
---
He could have fitted an improved cloak. He had a medium shield extender, something pretty much useless on an interceptor.
---
Make an alt, grab a frig and go welp some in FW.
---
The less you think about losses, the easier it will be to fight.
---
Is anyone else getting mild "EVE Online 2" vibes from the sudden and directed PR campaign in the last quarter? There is a very shared narrative about EVE being a strong community with a lot of interest that is held back by its old tech.
---
If this is Phase 1 of a marketing plan, the eventual phase 3 might be announcing a sequel. One that promises to keep all the good stuff while ditching all the outdated tech and systems.
---
Delve is pretty safe. Less safe actually now that Mar5meca has left, but still pretty safe. I feel a lot safer there than I do flying in high sec.
---
i think chutlanin might be worse that seddow
---
Or RMT
---
Why do you need to move them when you can activate it remotely ?
---
His aim is to be on the front page of r/eve
---
Why was Alex asking himself for a clue?
---
If game stopped being fun for you, just let it go. Dont give away your stuff, just keep it in a safe station, and stop playing for good. Cut it out of your system.. if the itch returns, cool, welcome back. If not, try to find a new hobby, a new game.
---
Myself, I dont pve. I‚Äôve not pve‚Äôd since like 2007. I think that that all mining leeched all the fun from you. Sell your rorqs, or most of them, grab some t1 frigs and go suicide on some shit. Laugh maniacally while doing so, dont involve yourself in PVE shit or boring patient blopsing, or shit like that. Fuck, just gran some cheap, spare T1 shit, and roam around, grab some like minded people, give them T1 frigs, roam round together while drunk, fuck comms discipline, fuck fc‚Äôs, fuck pissy leadership with rules, go have some fucking fun.
---
If you cant do that, game is dead for you. Congratulations, you have won EVE.
---
Now contract me your stuff. :P
---
Yesterday, I bought and fit 5 VFIs with the intent to lose them. Three of them were lost to camps. Only one of these camps could've been avoided if I warped in at 100 and checked first.
---
It's ridiculous that this many people camp small and novice plexes. Guess it's back to hunting VNIs in nullsec :(
---
Having an empty pod helps
---
It's not even that, I don't want to spend the time.  I've wasted so, so many hours on games.  Like to the point it was a problem.  This will be part of closing that chapter in my life.

---
The f*ck I don't give is that way.
---
It looks like it was flown like one.
---
Good god I just shuddered.
---
As long as they keep MTX strictly limited to SKINs etc, I would be 100% down for this. Eve is a great game but there's just too many 2003 design decisions that are just too difficult to fix without creating a bigger problem.
---
[02:58:40] Velsharoon &gt; radakos doesnt have the apm to unplug

looks like their efforts have been smothered
---
normally id agree, but then its radakos so iam not too sure about that one
---
The real question gentleman....
---
You must not have met Radakos yet
---
Story time ?
---
According to Twitter it's because we're all a bunch of racists. Ya know. Can't have any actual concerns. It's all just pure racism and were all terrible people.
---
Maybe add an option to only add "exact matches" within any given tab. I guess this only really matters when more people start using your service. So, when you are looking for a PvP exclusive corporation you can check "PvP" and and "exact matches only" and it'll only give you corporations that list only PvP in their activities.
---
Yesterday 6/6 embarrassing feeds for tapi, today hasn't started good either it seems, thank god legacy goal is to defend against evil rmters agression and not actually invade.

While I think it would kill the community moving to an "Eve Online 2" might actually get me back into the game.

i wonder when he gona rekk my caedes?tryed 2 times with new created asteros...smeel was putrid:))

I don't play Eve Online. Simply don't have time for MMOs these days, but I got a promo code and figured someone else might be able to use it.
---
No skillw have been removed, but CCP gave out free SP on a couple of occasions as an apology for some long-standing issues, particularly with local channels.
---
As someone who does not play Eve online, in game currency is not worth anything to me :P Figured it was better to give the code to someone who could use it than just let it rot.
---
Ah that makes a lot more sense.
---
pandaland lol

How barbaric! May as well not give you anything and put you in a cockpit and let you click things. Sheesh.

What a surprise.
---
Can I have some stuff as a fellow soon to quit player? Just sold my rorq alt and I haven't logged on in a week
---
Depends on whether or not you think scraping by a SB attempt is useless or not. Most people I've seen fit one because it can mean the difference between life and death in some situations.
---
answers questions exactly.  thanks
---
For me, the first Sleeper cache I was able to successfully crack, mostly.  It was not a Superior and I was in my typical Anathema.    
---
Found a battleship print, a few other prints that were decent but the 6 polarized HAM launcher prints and the 8 'Chainmail' storyline armor plates were my favorites.

I have not had the same success since... yet.  :)

Is he still ROTY in the Motd? please tell me yes.
---
You don't get KMs for corvette kills, also he gets killed by different people every time. At least think a little first.
---
Considering he wasn't bubbled doubt he'd rip implants
---
Isn't the playerbase slowly declining? Is this the ultimate evolution of ccp.math?
---
Nobody believes an EVE Online rumor until CCP officially denies it.
---
Teach horde how to shit-stomp new players so they can grow up like Pandemic Legion and just farm with 200man tengu fleets against Atrons. They'll be so God-Damned elite it nearly brings a tear to the eye
---
The damage race was awesome
---
New players need a holding hand it is sad but true. They can't play a game when they don't watch 10 tutorials on youtbe 15 streams and a tutorial that explains them every mechanic in the game.
---
I'll be honest, these massive coalitions are not good for the game. The stagnation they create, and the amount of distance they require people to travel to get fun fights, are one of the biggest things pulling down the playerbase.
---
Still bigger balls then everyone who has one and don't uses it.
---
Whatever you are smoking, I'll have some.
---
To be fair, it wasn't so many people back then. The population of Eve has gradually grown over the years and reached its peak around the time most MMOs are put out to pasture. 
---
The first few years of Eve's life it saw only an average of 5k concurrent players. It reached it's peak from 2010-2014 at around 60k concurrent players. It's been a slow decline since then to around 30-35k concurrent players, which only happens at the EU/US TZ crossover.
---
AAR?
---
Why would you need an improved cloak on a ceptor? The only thing you use it for is safing up
---
Sometimes "bigger balls" and "smaller brains" are synonyms. This is one of those times.
---
Nothing will be different
---
It would save you from smartbomb traps I guess.
---
Most fights aren't done with that much coordination. Usually it comes down to "who shows up." It's a rare corp that turns away people from a fleet, and a rare pilot who decides "eh I'll sit this one out" because they know the strength of the opposing fleet and it wouldn't be "fair."
---
WH entities are generally smaller, and in addition to that have a harder time getting what members they do have in one place in big ships. So it looks like they're being "honorable" when in reality the 5 or 6 destroyers that pop out of the hole were what was THERE.
---
he will,  it is his source of income
---
Gotta get that sweet iskies
---
We had a celebration in 2006/2007 when EVE hit 10K concurrent for the first time.
---
I'd be okay with it, but I highly suspect that there are a good portion of the playerbase that wouldn't be able to get past sunk cost if they won't transfer SP and Assets to EVE II.
---
Rage Star sends his regards. (Don't tell me I have no rl friends :D)
---
 A new game  with a new title will bring in more players than an upgraded game. People just like to try new things

Do you know anyone who has his moracha for salve @ below 570?
---
Oh fuck me.Can I join you?
---
This is very nice, but it needs the ability to filter by resolution. Or at least show the max resolution in the search results.
---
There's a difference between doing things with big balls and doing things with small brains.
---
Oh no he used an expensive ship must have a small brain.,
---
&gt; Not to mention the most shittiest default overview.
---
that hasn't changed
---
Yes it‚Äôs been multiple posts with just the zkill link and no AAR which is the biggest rule the mods never enforce.
---
Or something I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more
---
ok. you got me to lol in class. thanks
---
EVE 2, We go back and invade the home galaxy.  No Capital ships this time around because Lore McGuffin reasons.
---
If you see a smartbomb tap on a gate, you can warp to ten, activate cloak during your warp (you can warp cloaked with any cloaking device if you do it right), then manual pilot around the smartbombers or wait until they warp off thinking you're at a safe.
---
Improved cloaks reduce your speed a lot less than prototype cloaks; you can do this wth a prototype, but slowboating to the gate while cloaked is 150% faster with an improved cloaking device.

Also, as mentioned, it's FI.RE, not F.I.R.E.
---
Is there a way to search for a specific resolution  coz i'm not immediately seeing it ?

Would be nice if you could filter on multi-monitor wallpapers :)
---
Very odd. Care to speculate why one character received 250k and the other 750k?
---
29k of which are bots.
---
&gt; I started FW just over a week ago.

maybe you should play some more and become mad about some stupid game mechanics?

?
---
Incursions happen in hisec...
---
Pls tell me someone streamed/saved this shit.
---
Nope, soally. We asking him in disc.
---
One of the main issues is they have predictable damage type, specifically em/thermal.
---
So long as it gets alternated in usage, it's not such an obvious and/or counterable thing, but if your corp/alliance exclusively or very heavily used Amarr, opponents would be able to fit for these resists.
---
10k new players per week? Only one statement can be true
---
Not trying to hard to figure out who is an alt or not
---
Player retention rate of about 0.00000000001%

lol
---
Played the game for over 6 years...so yeah, I can say what I said.
---
I think he trying sellout it in bigger trade hub. He don‚Äôt gave any info about for what he moving it
---
How does that make sense?
---
There were some criteria for receiving the skillpoints such as time periods when the account was omega, and/or logged in and so on (I don't remember the specifics). It's possible one of your accounts failed to meet the criteria on one occasion.
---
Or maybe people feel a 15 year old game that doesn't have a proper tutorial isn't worth their time - given the million other options on the market today than weren't there so many years ago.
---
How is Lussy Lou randomly on this extremely high profile kill? lol
---
Makes you wonder... if you buy one of these, word gets out and you go on a list :)
---
The "meta" for game devs were different back then. MMOs are not as popular as they were before, and unless your game is some kind of BR you won't get a lot of players. The "new" generation is looking for something that EVE doesn't offer
---
where has the rum gone?
---
meh wrong fit get gud yada yada yada
---
AAR: 
---
We were casually gating carriers around Syndicate looking for  blops to kill when saw Lussy solo panthering the Moracha menace. It was impossibru to take the cruiser down with nerfed fighters, so we brought secret weapon - the plated Stratios.
---
Enormous Radakos's balls greatly increased Moracha inertia, so he flew straight into web/scram range and got Vonholed.
---
F
---
He used a Moracha without a snake set and got scrammed by a stratios. Using the ship doesn't make you stupid, spending half a trillion isk on it and then flying it with a clean pod into scram range of a ship you should be 3 times as fast as even before you count the BS webs on that thing is what makes you stupid.
---
Yikes. I was thinking of resubbing for some FW shenanigans, but if that's all people are doing in FW these days, there's no point to the fun tricks or the gudfites.
---
you've just said you joined fw a week ago. How do you can be mad about something after just a week
---
Very. :(
---
Jeff was kicked/left It was murky because I was a line member at the time.
---
He‚Äôs saying that dps/sec doesn‚Äôt make sense as a unit, at least not unless the caracal‚Äôs have a spool on their damage like trig guns do
---
I wasn't there at the last one, but for example the one before that i am perfectly content with receiving pyrolancea IV etc

You guys have phones...right?

You can transfer characters with 2 PLEX (1000 PLEX) by filing a support ticket. Usually it takes anywhere from 10 to 48 hrs.
---
I almost never get interesting content in jspace unless I feel like ganking or trying to kite a blob with a t3
---
&gt; If I have a friend who plays what would be the best way to give them all my assets, including characters?
---
Tell him you will give all assets. Hype him up. Tell him good stories, that he will love your carrier/rorq/idkwhat. Create a contract ingame and tell him to check it.
---
It will only contain a bookmark.
---
Named 'ur gay pwnd'.
---
Tell your friend you sold the assets and you eventually plan to come back so you needed the liquid for plex. Convice him.
---
Then after he truly believes your story, contract all assets to him, including your extracted characters' skill injectors, because you keep your characters with 5m SP to log in two years from now.
---
And yeah, keep your assets scattered in New Eden. Is there an Archon deep in null? It's yours, friend, now go walk the path of the warrior and get to the system I lived in and get it.

this whole post is some /r/comedyheaven shit
---
Create alpha character, move to perimeter, give money to this account. Buy injector, contract to main, activate it remotely.

Do you really need to Buy injectors more expensive ?

In Soviet Russia, FiRE and Legacy are both stronk independent coalitions.

Wait what? Alphas get t2 guns now? The fuck don't alphas get now

Goddamn. Dude. I think he trying sell self-sp and trying deliver dat in jita/amarr/peri/etc.
---
It‚Äôs not my personage and I don‚Äôt know what he wanted doing with that stuff, but my version is just logic

I keep seeing these things as tales of lore, and vaguely heard that a few were used for in-game events - where the models really that large?

I was shooting a BNI with the moracha , and Loki. BNI was in low hull, and I flew right into the nemesis got scram webbed, primaried the nemesis (kill it) as a stratios uncloaks, and applied scram, web, and lights cyno, rest is my dying in a ball of fire.
---
This was not my ship, and may it RIP. Not sure if I will continue to play or not since I will have to rip my sp from all but 2 of my characters, sell all my abyssal mods, and caps I own to somewhat pay the owner back for the aggressive feed. 
---
Sorry Casper24.

Oops! Yes I did. And I should've known better too!
---
Eve Online, fun for all of the (insomniac) family :)
---
Monster **** race.
---
Ham and Cheese. Nice black forest ham and some sharp cheddar; mustard, mayo, onion. It was rather tasty I must admit
---
The final day of Eve Online needs to be one of these in Jita. Every single player is tasked to destroy it as a final send off. Everyone banding together. Goons and Pandemic etc all together to get the biggest kill mark of them all. The person who gets the final blow gets a commemorative statue sent home for them to cry over when they can't drop supers on frigates anymore.
---
IKR, I was just trying to understand this guy.

Probably not that high, but if you take away the bots and alt accounts people are multiboxing on you would probably be down to about 20k from my guess

I mean you are in test so clearly there are worse choices than what I did :D

Can anyone explain the significance of this to me? Just started eve and don't know a lot of the lingo in this thread.

So I can think of a few things you could be doing with your time rather than talking on Reddit.

If he's actually partnered CCP might want to look into suing him for lost revenues. He's damaging the game's image. Pretty sure it's all viewbots.
---
On that logic should Unspoken be lumped in with the Imperium?
---
Not sure why twitch hasn't banned him.
---
So we have been having this dance for 13 days when are you going to ask me out for lunch?
---
Nobody is actually going to watch prerecorded footage of someone mining

There's a reason I barely watch twitch anymore.
---
It shows that you were not preaching in Central Russia and that you are a bad missionary.  You're mother deserves better son.
---
Awh okay get back to work!!!!
---
CCP didn't design it, period. It's a bunch of scripts written in a Python mutation that doesn't let you scale to even dual core. A lot of companies (so not blaming specifically them here) make the mistake of not recognizing soon enough that a piece of software is about to outgrow what it was made for and they paint themselves into a corner. It's crazy difficult to rewrite that code now, but it would've been reasonable back then.
---
I will save some for sure and upload them on the site.
---
Thank you.
---
Where's the fun now if black rise is aids? Everyone in amarr/mini?
---
Stop asking questions that you should not ask. I mean this weekend was easter you should do your job for at least one day.
---
Going by CCP's golden track record I'm placing my bets on it eventually being cancelled.
---
The Moracha is an Alliance Tournament (AT) ship. AT ships are rewards for winning a small scale PvP tournament (means you‚Äôre a good player).
---
The rarity and power of these ships causes them to be ridiculously expensive and generally flown only by competent pilots. Rip my AT prospects.
---
This. I lost count years ago of the number of times I saw "and we dropped carriers on their gatecamp...got counter dropped and died". Supers are way less fun due to the ridiculous tank, I'm all for enabling retarded cap welps.

---
I dont know if someone has already suggested that, but you can freely donate all your assets to a friend. For The characters I am not 100% sure on that since I havent done it myself as of yet but I think you can make a Post on the character trading bazar and then just close it as being "sold". I think it costs 20 bucks per character to transfer on someone elses account. Else you can switch your current e-mail on a throw away email, give that throw away email to your friend together with passwords and he shall switch the email to his and change the passwords again for all the accounts.   
---
Another way would be to melt assets for enough skill extractors and just extract every skill out of your characters then just blow them up somewhere in deepspace/abyssal or whatever give the extractors out for free I dont care (but if you do contract some of them to me please :-P)
---
Or another way would be to just delete all your characters for good. I mean if you want to leave EVE for good just get rid of everything that can keep the urge to play alive. 
---
At last, if you have a slight feeling you might want to come back at any point. Liquidize all your remaining assets and buy PLEX for it. Lock those plex away and whenever you have the itch again you have at least one character with a ton of PLEX to subscribe and buy some ships again. Or sell couple of your characters to turn into PLEX.

Wow I was expecting just subtitles, this is actually real good.

Put your shoulder to the wheel.
---
Why is it that Eve players have this arrogance, like it takes someone of superior intelligence to play Eve? Some of the dumbest fucking people I've ever talked to have been from this game.
---
Remember that paying for Omega speeds up the skill queue. So when you figured out what you wanna do. Plan out your skills and get it going as soon as possible. Also invest in implants when you reach a point where isk income is high.
---
Everyone's posting is worse than Wally's.  Probably our best poster since Vic Jefferson (rip).

Because EVE Online, the best sandbox MMORPG, has dwindling numbers. Meanwhile about 50 million people tried Apex Legends in just one month after release. Fortnite and Call of Duty BR is not doing that bad either. And even frikkin CSGO has a BR mode now.

Also something something statistics something sample size something anecdotal evidence does not prove anything.

Let me guess, you've never ever fought in casual pvp, correct? Come visit geminate sometime.

...then I just return to my first alliance, after donating about 50kkk to these guys. They returned half of this bunch of isks. I shoot then things with a tristan, not with Legion or repping things with Guardian.

the magic is to also use them for other usefull things. Like invention, building and research. 800m per year per account doesnt feel like much anymore.

I honestly think we should be pushing for more interesting stream content than that.

If I come back to eve like I'm considering right now maybe I'll start a solo/smallgang pvp stream. What happened to zarvox? Eve needs people who will just derp fights and show people that solo pvp doesn't have to be "elite".

I second this. 90% of the wallpapers seem to be 1080p. And I know eve players like to keep pplaying their game on a toaster. But most people have migrated to 1440p or higher.

The key to sustaining EVE Online's community -- which has 300,000 monthly active-users, around the same number of residents as Petursson's native Iceland -- for so long has been about recognising and facilitating the ingenuity of its players. Continuing to do that while also¬†adding more players in territories like Asia, however, may very well be beyond the capabilities of CCP's current technology.
---
"Last year, I think about a million people came into our systems in one way or another for the first time"
---
Bullshit.
---
I ran a few missions to get the hang of things (which is why you see me advocate for the Bloodstained Stars in my new player posts) and jumped into WWB as fast as I could.
---
The thing that everyone is missing is that Eve attracts a very specific player type. The people who stick around are attracted by complex puzzles and even more complicated mechanics. We figure shit out on our own, and then figure out five different ways to break it to give us an advantage. Plus an unusually large number of pure sociopaths, hah.
---
We should emphasize recruiting casual WoW players less and focus more on the tinkers who will stick around. We need both, the are more of the former than the latter, but the latter are a better long term investment.

If anything you'd want them to stay in your pod so you don't look like Radakos.

I thought they released some limited edition ones for web + scram range. And they do exist in the neocom app as Inquest ‚ÄúEros‚Äù Stasis Webifier MR-807
---
I guess you‚Äôre new to this whole flair thing
---
So like. It‚Äôs between that and ganking high-sec abyss sites.
---
&gt;So, why did they not run their 100 bots already before? They would have earned more $.
---
Maybe there was no need or it was deemed too risky given the lack of reward. They dont necessarily sell more isk because they generate more. But if they sell a certain amount, and their ships are nerfed, they can easily add more bots to compensate.
---
large EMP tech 2 smartbomb has a range of 7.5KM, so the battleships needs to sit at atleast that range. now add another KM for the BS model. And you'll be landing 1-1.5KM from the BS

eve players like to jerk about how their game is so COMPLEX AND COMPLICATED

which ironically makes it really difficult to have any actual conversations about the state of the game

see: threads about "numbers" balancing where people really be pretending changing numbers in a database is impossible for eve

We Brake for Rorquals is what sealed this lmfao

They wyvern looks like a hammer though. It looks like it would knock that rusty shack to bits. The hel does have some of the best skins though.

I've always said that if I ever got a wyvern, I would make it something along the line of the hammer,third hammer, or something hammer related.

He's laughing because someone decided to only send a single frigate against his fleet.

&gt; Final timer over Raitaru, FRAT form eagles and some jackdaw v RUS Macharial, TAPI Eagle and voltron maller gang. RUS drop triage but not tank as they run away from eagle out of triage range and some friends drop bomb on them, TAPI eagle show up but not really do much as we position with very good precision and they not hurt us. Raitaru die after RUS have to bring in carrier and haw dread to try to kill us. Very good fight, China #1.
---
is it though?
---
Why are you certain Roubal is not guilty?
---
Some corps will welcome you back. Some will even help you get your assets extracted to somewhere safe if you or they aren't sure you'll be rejoining. Maybe this is more common in w-space than in nullsec.
---
Never forget!
---
Zero logic. Zero facts. Zero statistics. And you're probably a pedophile.
---
One more reason I left null. It's just boring.
---
In words you can understand: the ship is worth 500-600 billions isk.
---
Why don't you? (pvp)
---
If the strat didn't tackle you why didn't you warp when the carriers entered grid?
---
So I want to haul about over around 350m worth of misc cargo from Hi-sec to Jita (11 Jumps). 
---
The thing is, all the goods only takes about 2000m3 cargo.

Would it be a good idea to cram it all in my dominix w/ 7 Expanded Holds. Right now it has 33k EHP though shield extenders would probably raise it

None of us complain that it's impossible - We complain that Devs aren't given time to do it, as it's important for the health of the game.

---
What is the game now? I havent played since around alphas came out.
---
I agree that for some that's all the progression that's needed. That would be a good thing since that's really all EVE has to offer. I'm not saying that it's bad in any way but it is very linear. However, yo don't need to undock at all to do that. In fact, you can train a titan pilot without ever undocking if you wanted. That being the case, you still need to find a reason to undock. My point would be that with so many incomplete and/or unpolished systems it gets really hard to find that reason. 
---
I've always found EVE to be strange in that regard. Activity counts for nothing.
---
In a way EVE seems like the guy who has a bunch of rusty old cars in his yard. He'll tell you how they're all unique and collectible and I'm pretty sure he thinks you're jealous of his cars. They may have been awesome in their day and perhaps would be amazing if they were in better shape. However, the reality is he has a junk yard on his property. That junk has the potential to be what he would like, but they need work. I think we would all like to see them fixed up.

---
listen jintaan i know u mean well for the game but you can't read that thread and tell me people support numbers balancing
---
the issue with balancing in this godforsaken game is that there's no iteration at all, it's new mechanics or mods that are released in one state and then are never touched for like 2 years
---
SC is hot garbage. It's never going to get done. They already made too much money by selling pledges and will never see the same cash flow from a real game (especially the clunky barebones tech demo they have now).
---
Back in the day it was considered an exploit by some in FW. CCP said nothing. Then it changed when they were fixing other parts of acceleration Gates and now it isn't there.
---
Probably safer than carrier ratting lately
---
"we stop for rorquals" damn you you put too much effort into your posts
---
Weren't those needed for faction implants way back when before the LP store?
---
that's what can happen when someone donate all his isks to someone's friend
---
returning and slowly gathering isks ans SP back
---
&gt;why did so many people start playing it back in 2004/2005 and perserve
---
They didn't. On Talking In Stations, someone (don't remember who) mentioned that right before they created skill injectors, looking at the distribution of SP - which gives a rough indication of how long the character has been playing - shows that the amount of people that started playing from near the beginning and stuck with it is only a very tiny minority.
---
No no no, see that isn't how it would be. That's not hamstrung enough.

It would be Windows Phone OS only.

Exceedingly expensive and rare tournament prize ship got blown up because of questionable decisions and bad piloting skill.

The ship is so uncommon that it's unlikely you'll ever see one in the wild flying on the server, even if you play for years.

What happens when you argue the lowest common denominator?

yea right away i did, but then the stratios uncloaked as the nemesis popped, and webbed/scrammed me. From there I knew it was over.

Eve Online drama battles over space pixels between adults will always have a special place I  my heart. The evil CEO, the rebel leader who takes the newbros under his wing to protect them, the random goon on Reddit with selective screenshots.

I used to mine gas while on my phone in null sec, but that was using team viewer from the phone to my PC. When not in PVP team viewer actually isn't a bad way to play the game.

But instead I died :). Least the magpie dropped so came out way ahead
---
I remember cries about the "Hans slide" and how it was a exploit
---
This is not surprising at all. A lot of new players are turned off by the long skill training.
---
Newbie: "Hey this ship looks really cool. How long do i need to train for it? ... 2 months???"
---
EVE: You can skip training time with skill injectors.
---
Newbie: "Sounds great. How much? ... 8 bill ISK or 80$?? That is so expensive!! Fuck this shit im out"
---
If CCP really wants to keep new players, they have to rework the skill training. Just remove filler skills like the magic 14. In tutorial show them the basic roles/directions of EVE players like tackling, brawling and logi, then give them some a bunch of SP and pointers to PvP resources to jump start their favorite role/direction.
---
&gt; If you are so swelled up with pride then yes, don't pull them
---
isn't the entire point of pulling implants preseving your pride and kb?

hmmmmmmm

These comments are making me feel good (I guess?) for starting this game 2 months ago and not quitting.

Are you in a corp that is war decced?

The videogame industry in general has gotten stupider, as companies realized that hamsters are way better for farming money than tourists, or intelligent customers.  Modern videogames are (mostly) just a hamster wheel that collectively train us for microtransactions and grinding, to mske us think that is a fun, acceptable product to throw money at.  So, naturally, a game that doesn't put you on the wheel right away, in which the real payout is its endless years of challenge and interest, is going to struggle.

Back in 03-05 games were more like stories, and the people coming in had different goals and more patience.
---
If you temporarily upgrade to omega for a few months, you can train beyond the 5 mil cap and when you drop back to alpha you keep the skills up to the 20mil limit. Also, the 20 mil limit is limited to the total pool of available alpha skills, so if you do this make sure to train only the skills that are available to alphas. If you train an omega only skill you will not lose the sp but you will lose access to that skill when you drop back to omega.
---
Absolutely!
---
I recently jumped back in after a 6 year hiatus (first stint only lasted a few months for school/commitment reasons) so I basically feel like a first-timer. 
---
Eve is a game that gives back only as much as you put into it, but it's totally possible *and feasible* to enjoy yourself as a new player, especially if you start slow and temper your expectations. 
---
I recommend the "core courses" by [Jurius Doctor](https://youtu.be/hdwN-ZLjqc0). The videos can get a bit dense, but you can gloss over the nitty gritty details for now.
---
You might already be ahead of the curve, but if you haven't tried the in-game tutorials (accessible via the Agency) you'll want to get those out of the way ASAP. They're a little dull, but the lessons learned and equipment earned are valuable when you're just starting out.
---
And most importantly, don't spread yourself too thin! Once you've sampled the different careers through the Agency, pick the one that you found the most fun and just stick to it for a while. You'll get to see everything eventually‚Äîtake it slow for now. Mining is a great starting point.
---
As for corps, you don't *have* to join one if you don't want to. I think there's value in being a quiet blip in the cosmos. Do what you like, and know that every activity, not matter how small, has some impact on the greater universe. But if you would like a little guidance, there are plenty of friendly corps out there that will show you the way.
---
Eve can be a very *zen* experience. Eventually, you'll want to venture out of high-sec space, but don't rush anything. Take your time and if you can rope a friend or two into it, it'll be even more rewarding.
---
I think I will try this suggestion, thanks!
---
Shit posting at its best
---
I doubt you need to do that.
---
they don't form or they blob us, nice job ruining the game ;\_;
---
If you got discord on your phone you don't even need to log in to the client...
---
‚Äúit sounds like you don't want high-sec to be a thing. ‚Äú
---
Yes
---
That sounds like a You Problem not a Me Problem.
---
It's not blame, it's a legitimate statement.
---
We have *a lot* of things we can bitch about when it comes to the state of EVE Online, but the game-breaking lag of these massive fights isn't one of them. Expecting any company, let alone one working with a 16 year old dog that's hard to teach new tricks, to manage it is ludicrous. And in the same way that expanding a road network in a city won't improve traffic because it convinces more to drive, any increase to maximum playercount for these battles will just have us funnel more fuckers into system. 
---
They make the game, and we break the game. That's just how it goes. It's not their fault they can't do what literally no one in the history of videogame design has managed to do, let alone even attempted.
---
Honestly, it doesn't sound like you've touched the PVP aspect of the game at all. I would hold off on giving away anything until you've actually done that. 
---
Tbh I don't really understand the mentality of playing this game for the sake of grinding isk, and I would also have zero motivation to play if that's what I did. I spend 100% of my time in PVP and having a blast.
---
Tapi move up north, feed feed feed

Tapi move (goalposts) back south, feed feed feed
---
Here's Tom with the weather...
---
Awesome!
---
I pull implants to deny that juicy podmail myself..
---
Change the password and email and give him the login. Anything outside eve is unrelated.
---
I'm getting a friend started and have quit and come back dozens of times. I need to be careful to not just give him everything and let him earn stuff for himself. I stopped multiboxing for the most part. It just wasn't fun, and fortunately I've kept my main all this time. So I mostly just play as him.
---
Odd, I don't remember drifter scrams stopping MJDs.
---
I give this a 5 out of 7
---
Most interesting that majority  of fights between Winter Co and TEST/FIRE are almost equal in number and almost no large scale use of supers. What a time to be alive!
---
Wasn‚Äôt able to make it to the last one due to work, I should be able to come this time.

---
The gaming industry in 2004 was tiny. Gamers back then didnt have 1 million games to chose from. Espeically scifi and MMORPG fans had to stick with what they had.
---
I still remember my console gaming day in the late 90s and early 2000s. You bought a game, you finishied it and then you bought the next one.
---
Today i have over 150 unplayed games in my Steam library form all the sales ... if i dont really like a game i just play something else.
---
yea I sure try to. Of course you cant every time. win some lose some. what does it matter anyway?
---
Enjoyable read, might pop by your discord if you guys are recruiting
---
I didn't realize that was his reddit account lol
---
how many of those ignored are innocent as well but not screaming like politicans do?
---
Feldman's Deli just south of Sugarhouse. To far from downtown for lunch today now I'm sad.
---
I‚Äôll have to give that place a shot, thank you
---
It maybe more likely than you think.
---
Another 7/5 quality gif!  Nothing will top the skill injector gif though.
---
Thought I'd try a variation of can I have your stuff but it missed the mark :P.
---
Soon they'll be barely rem-ember-ed
---
They don't, but you can still be in range of the drifters point after MJDing
---
&gt; what does it matter anyway?
---
it matters insofar as people want it to matter, and by both yours and the others replies it does seem to be the case.
---
Yeah, don't get point kited lol
---
There's like a zero percent chance, IMO if they made EVE 2 that you get to carry over your SP and assets.
---
One of the NUMBER ONE reservations new player prospects have about EVE is "I will never catch up to the established players (in SP or ISK). 
---
Now obviously injectors have helped that a little, but it's a huge barrier to would-be new players in general.
---
If they do EVE 2, they would want to fix this asap. I imagine they could let you carry over some of these things:
---
* Corporation/Alliance names, history, logo
---
* Character name, employment history
---
* PLEX vault account
---
* Maybe BASIC skills like "Can fly Caldari cruisers" 
---
Keep in mind if they do EVE 2, they would likely revamp the entire skill tree. So there may no longer be something like "faction battleships" or if there are, the requirements to fly them might be different.
---
Do you get to the cloud district often? Oh what am I saying, of course you don‚Äôt.
---
2 nanos
---
Always
---
we killed them the other day as well, they are probably the dumbest wormholers i have ever encountered, and i always regarded myself as a mouthbreather when it came to WH's.
---
There are much better choices for that. If you're not worried about smart bombers (hisec) I'd just use a shuttle. If smart bombing is an issue, I'd just get an instawarping Dramiel or a yacht or something.
---
This. I very rarely even think about engaging comets, and when someone hypes them and people fly them a ton, I'm left thinking "go elsewhere", or play for traps/camping for a while. Nobody likes traps or instalockers, either.
---
We also don't have universal databases for information.
---
Look at osrs or wow, one has a very comprehensive wiki, the other has the best database in gaming with detailed comments explaining literally every item/spell id in the game.
---
Meanwhile eve has the eveuni wiki and everything else information wise is private and scattered through different alliances or groups.
---
So...you actually take screenshots from others and upload them on your site?
---
As did whatever remains of my soul...
---
Delete C4 space tbh
---

This must be his CSM stance too.
---
What‚Äôs the Rubal Report?
---
Well you picked one single line from my text, well done. Its one out of several options i have shown him. But keep on trolling
---
Yes but why they matter to different people will result in the outcome of the opinion. Which one are your referencing specifically?
---
&gt;The allure of EVE Online has never been found in its style or sheen or thrilling gameplay.
---
Checks out.
---
Too much Vodka
---
Quick, someone explain to them what alts en masse means.
---
I am pretty sure those are not 'new' players, but alts.
---
Well, you are wrong.
---
Most of them are CCP.
---
If i get some screen shoots for other i ask permission.
---
Some are made by me.
---
Says who? How come, at the primetime yesterday we had 30000 players online?
---
ok i was trying to say it in a roundabout way to be less mean but good lord, people are laughing at the idea of flying a moracha without a snake set and in the situation where you did manage to unplug(which does look quite unlikely) the absurdity that it is you even caring about a hg snake set km when losing a moracha, for i'm sure the hunters were really sad for that pod 100x less valuable than the ship.
---
seriously mate just cut your losses and let it go, you ain't gonna get anything doubling down on it
---
Hmm maybe they should spend more time and energy keeping the players they have if they can't get out of the rut of Eve. Instead of trying to dream up news ways to apply Eve to other games.
---
&gt; But most people have migrated to 1440p or higher
---
Enjoyed the conviction you wrote this absolute bollocks with.
---
The FW alphaing meta lately is "do it once and move because if you camp the same spot the next guy is dropping a super on you"
---
I don't see Fawlty7 on the BR.
---
I did cut my losses, and pulled the pod. When you notice you are going to lose a ship you have a window to pull them. If I didn't have snakes in I would just say it.
---
&gt; old.reddit
---
aah that's the good shit
---
make c6s dual static.
---
If the choice was either an event site guristas event with loot table that included accelerators, random meh skins and clothes. I'd rather have no event and see the resources that would have been put to that go towards something else.
---
&gt;Says who?
---
CCP
---
&gt;How come, at the primetime yesterday we had 30000 players online?
---
This is a retarded argument. 
---
1. Most people doesn't even play every day, peak numbers one day doesn't say shit, you need to look at total *unique* numbers over at least a month before you get good statistics.
---
2. There are lots of different timezones, 
---
3. If it were lots of new alts, they wouldn't stop logging in after a few days, never to log in again
---
Well, the legend of iBeast continues
---
Those rats paying top dollars.
---
I believe we were late to the fight.
---
I could imagine a GM at CCP laughed with his/her coworkers on this killmail and then issued the reimbursement
---
:popcorn:
---
CCP release the report!
---
well, uh, that¬¥s basically why civilised countries don¬¥t have death penalties in the first place, so that point is kinda moot.
---
50MN mwd, expensive pod, and drugs, propulsion mode. Dunno the exact recipe but pyfa got to 13.4k/s pretty easily and for under 4B with HG snakes and some other hardwires. There's probably a way to fuss around the rigs/lows to have 3 speed boosts and make it reach 14k. Cap stability is trivial, you have tons of CPU and free mids, so just pop cap rechargers in there.
---
For this kind of loss, I'd just leave the pod in for the swagger tbh.

The Rubal Report!
---
eve brings all the maniacs to the yard yo...
---
All i see is two sexually frustrated basement dwellers going at it.
---
It's roast day apparently. I like it.
---
Your argument, because when you add more players to the game, the average and peak numbers would go up, not down.
---
The people deserve the unredacted report
---
[img-timeline]
---
I submitted a bug report on this months ago. Shame its still happening.
---
It would if people kept playing, yes. The whole problem is that they don't.
---
It also implies that no one stops playing.
---
nearly everything in Eve is safe, "Asset Safety".
---
I was showing a younger guy I work with some stuff on Eve one time and his jaw dropped at some of the total training time to get in to and fly some of the ships in Eve. He basically said "Fuck that". One of his big complaints was that you couldn't train more than 1 character per account without paying extra, which I kind of agree with. You already pay for the account, yet can't "level" more than 1 character at a time, even at a reduced rate.
---
I'm normally for anyone can run for csm...  but not this guy. Please. Not. This. Guy.
---
Link?
---
Sometimes you can sit on a hole connected to kspace cause kspace people are generally clueless as to how to PvP in a wh. Get away with alpha arty 1 shot ships for a while and it can be really fun. Been parking a svipul on nullsec connections lately :)
---
Ah that makes sense. I've always just pulled on instinct if time allows
---
It is if you do literally anything else with the accounts.
---
Is it even worth it? What do L5 missions pay out these days? And they aren‚Äôt all camped to shit?
---
Ah yes. I have always tried to pull implants on instinct if time allows ofc.
---
This is a good way to start the week.
---

Pretty sure the current EVE team doesn't have the talent to actually create a new game from scratch.  They can't even make changes to the prebuilt product without extreme design flaws (and I'm not talking about legacy code, I'm talking about pants-on-head-retarded/out of touch decisions).  See the fact that literally every game they've tried to make in the last 5 years has been an utter failure as proof.
---

I'm not sure if I'd call hole camping "fun" lol, you don't really get any interesting fights. I've never been much for camping.
---
Just bring back the first Crimson Harvest. That event was the best. Simple, easy enough to do in a PVP fit. 12/10
---
eve has a lot more tho tbh. there are several wikis not just the e uni one and ebsites with db info like chruker
---
How the hell did my comment deserve a down vote. Y'all are bums.
---
god i hope brisc stays banned
---
That was changed at least at the time of the last devblog about starting the investigation. Nothing new here.
---
Yeah that is my point. There are a million different places with scattered information.
---
I can't go to wowhead, type in literally anything that exists in the game, and come out knowing exactly what I needed to know.
---
Finding information in eve is a bitch and a half, and the NPE suffers because of it.
---
At least they both use rigs?
---
&gt; The people who stick around are attracted by complex puzzles and even more complicated mechanics. We figure shit out on our own, and then figure out five different ways to break it to give us an advantage. Plus an unusually large number of pure sociopaths, hah.
---
you still have time to delete this comment and avoid the shame
---
That was updated the same day the interim report was released.
---
I'm mixed on it tbh. Dealing with bots and especially bomber running minmatar missions (Hello Aping Makanen and your many pulling alts in shuttles) is a real pain when sliding is possible. The main way to nail them is to beat them to the acceleration gate and point them outside.
---
That said, I totally got nailed by a jaguar at 0 outside a novice last night and sliding would have saved me and gotten the juicy breacher kill inside (thanks for your recent vid, I'm getting a lot of bad breachers!)
---
This is why we cant have nice things...
---
Thats because usually when supers are dropped en masse the fight evaporates. So you never see them posted to reddit unless someone feeds a whole fleet. I would say a major portion of potential fights have been blue balled by the dropping of capital fleets.
---
this tbh

I came up with that title. Thanks for so much credit.

therefore making it your negligence which caused lack of credit
---
&gt;everything else information wise is private and scattered through different alliances or groups  
---
  
---
This is what you wrote and i hinted you at it being wrong. Theres more public and easily accessible information than the e uni wiki.

You know nothing about FW.
---
maybe, but this was at least after the LP store came out, also Ihakana usually has one of the highest buy orders for them so I assume that's what they were going for.
---
The goal is to get non sov alliances in there yes, i do draw a line at some points if its like a 50 person corp or alliance; I am not here to be counter super hunting intelligence. 
---
I think it would be nice to get none sov and NPC sov coalitions in the list but it requires some diplo structure on the coalition end to reach out sometimes. If I know about a coalition I try to add em. If a group has sov I don‚Äôt know I go check zkill and try to figure out who is their friends
---
Cheers I was just running low on my supply of popcorn.
---
Would be nice to allow 2nd/3rd character slots to train simultaneously at alpha level (half train speed and only up to 5m sp)

If 1% of them of them stuck around thats over 5000 new players every year.

Yet CCP have never (sucessfully) done anything to discourage them.

EVE is a PVP game.  Everyone knows this when joining or shortly after.  This is like going to the PVP areas of wow and getting mad people kill you while questing.
---
It‚Äôs magical.
---
that's a rare insult right there
---
Hell no, I stand by what I said. Eve isn't some point and shoot POS you can learn in an hour. The mechanics are complex and take years to master (albeit only weeks to get proficient), and I think we can all agree that it's definitely *not* user friendly. Not to mention that our history is filled with absurdly complicated schemes and long term plans. 
---
A game like that appeals to specific types of people, and I wish CCP would focus more on attracting those players rather than just trying to race to the bottom for people who will probably quit after a month. I get that they need to make it more accessible to some degree, and that we also need those filthy casuals (I spend plenty of time hunting them), but I'm arguing that we recognize and play to our strengths.
---
Looks good, hopefully you can get enough adoption to make it a good resource.
---
Over the last 2 months the profitability of a maximum efficiency SP farm account has been between -800m and -12b per year.
---
Meaning you'd still need to be earning that amount on the accounts just to break even.

Which isn't really viable if you were one of the people running 500 accs

Make a new overview profile, call it "dscan" or something similar. Select which stuff you want to see. After saving it, it will show up in the drop-down on your d-scan window.

You don't do a massive overhaul like the 64-bit client upgrade on a product you plan to ditch soon.

Lol this is adorable.  You literally did nothing, but are so proud!
---
Yes, we can put your drawing on the fridge sweetie :)
---
nahhh, not late to the fight. but we fought at range, and it was hard to track/dmg them.
---
we didn't lose much, and caught basically all that was broadcasted early enough or did not fuck up and was randomly 150km out of range...
---
About the machs, I really wonder... they were most basically all the time in half armor. TEST logi repped their shield, but with armor machs it didn't help alot... i really wonder why the FIRE guys were not able to rep them back up the whole time... So the WC fleet had easy time volleying the machs as they only had 50% buffer or so...
---
https://i.imgur.com/sSKZNR5.gifv
---
I don't see TEST feeding at all tbh... FIRE machs did, not legacy
---
Hk evicting in 2019, they never learn smh
---
they could undercut their RMT competitors. so yes, they would sell more...
---
It would be very strange if there was just one single RMT organisation active in eve...
---
shut up, I can have you kicked out of any shitty little alliance your in just be a few words in discord, if you ever think about disrespecting me again I will deploy the full arsenal of the northern coalition and evict your punk ass, even if your in a small 200 man alliance i dont care, even if your in the middle of the fucking drone lands i dont care.
---
I am coming for you bitch.
---
Couldn't the machs just warp to a friendly structure?
---
Soft shadows dont exist in space.  There is no atmosphere to diffuse the light.  All shadows are razor sharp.

There were 500 titans in Q4 2010 when they were 10x the price they are now. Wouldn't be surprised if there were 7.5-10k now.

Old news
---
They are, Hilmar addresses this in his AMA. The problem for EVE right now isn‚Äôt that it can‚Äôt attract people, it‚Äôs getting those people to stick around. 10,000 people try each week, but almost all of them are gone by 30 days. It‚Äôs why the New Player Experience is such a key focus.
---
You think EVE is dead? You think EVE will die in the next couple years?
---
Get in fucking line with the millions of people before you that did the same thing and were wrong. You think Star Citizen will kill EVE? Then what the hell are you doing over here instead of burdening Star Citizen with your autofellatio.

I am in favor of adding more sensual PVP to eve, wormholer btw

Actually they played on the Serenity server and followed the rules there. 
---
The rules on the Serenity server dont match the TQ rules. People love to ignore that.
---
Botting account sharing and other rules we have that would get entire alliance shitcanned on TQ are not in the rulebook on Serenity. 
---
On TQ, as CCP own the server and control the game (NetEaase own the server and run the game in China, CCP only own the IP and are basically just the Dev House for Netease to Publish.) they enforce as they see fit.

Despite the op sometimes it is the lil guy that has our love, is good to see them art it.

---
Everything was kept in cans that dropped. No matter which way you slice it, it's still a massive wtf.
---
Would also explain where a lot of the panda isk is coming from.
---
It appears you might be right. I would expect at least some small piece of evidence to back up superfluous claims.
---
Friendly fire too
---
Carriers just got another nerf.  Rats will Target your fighters more and your fighters have higher sign radius.
---
It is much more difficult to keep your fighters alive since the last patch.  The thannys fighter hp bonus makes it arguably the best carrier for ratting now.
---
I previously said:
---
&gt; I would say there are three possible scenarios in this situation:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 1) CCP have watertight evidence that Brisc spoke to people outside of the CSM about matters under NDA - however well intentioned - and there also exists no evidence that any other member of the CSM has spoken to people not covered by the NDA about CSM matters - whether to get exert feedback or not.
---
&gt; 2) Brisc spoke with subject matter experts outside the CSM about ideas that came up. Other CSM members did also but the players they spoke to respected the accepted convention that you don't metagame CCP. CCP are therefore punishing Brisc because other players took advantage of him, not because he broke the NDA.
---
&gt; 3) Brisc is an idiot and decided to risk his real-world job for a few more spacebucks.
---
I forgot option 4: CCP gonna CCP
---
Chinese cheating? No way, they would never do that.
---
Who in his right mind would be in low sec with that and stream it.
---
People did just that.
---
Run potentially hundreds of accounts with 3 chars, remapped for full efficiency with implants, doing nothing but training and extracting.
---
Last year you could be making 15b per acc per year doing that.
---
Scale that to 2 or 3 hundred accounts....
---
&gt; There are a million different places with scattered information.
---
Gonna just quote that guy until you notice that having lots of places with little snippets of possibly outdated information is not the better new player experience.
---
CCP is gonna Rick Rubal us all.
---
It's why they support the Russians

Thanks, that‚Äôs what I figured.

If you do something in eve and never post about it. Did you really do anything?

It's still a huge fuck up in terms of ISK value lost.

That is true about virtually every hobby after doing it for 10ish years.

cool, that wasnt my point though and it wasnt what he initially said either.

much like NC.s deployment

Yea, 7 marauders, ouch. Someone needs to tell them that‚Äôs an obsolete ship class/isk sink

Uh....some people stop playing every day too.

His kb shows a distinctly relaxed attitude to losing expensive ships.

AAR: Brax came across this C4 and recognised the corp as one of the Wicked Creek krab groups we'd been hunting. We got 3-4 pro Leshak multiboxers together to start hitting structures. On the fort armor timer they undocked 4 HICs, warped down to our leshak group and suddenly the fort spiked to 50+ they undocked a sizeable Domi / Nestor / Leshak fleet. Thankfully their HIC pilots were mentally deficient, and we escaped with no losses on either side [besides this tackle devoter.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76097928/)
---
They had saved their fort, but we'd already put their Azbel into structure. We returned the next day with a full fleet, and managed to catch them on their C3 static as they tried to take hole control.

---
Note the [ISBoxing coercers](https://i.imgur.com/5WiQ4IP.png). May not seem like much, but the fast target switching of that many 500dps frigates led to our sole loss.
---
Most of corp forgot about the hole for a couple weeks and moved onto other things. Brax was hell-bent on clearing it out. He managed to save our staging POS basically solo after the residents reffed it, and he re-reinforced their structures. We returned for the fort armor timer with a 20-man Leshak + loki fleet and met zero resistance besides the fort gunner. When we came back today there wasn't even a gunner, so we were expecting the fort to be basically empty.
---
I wish I could give you a final loot tally, but Brax has a "kill everything, free for all on loot" policy so we're not entirely sure how much we scooped. Probably somewhere in the region of 50-80bil.
---
&gt;Would also explain where a lot of the panda isk is coming from.
---
[no one asked for an explanation where the panda isk was coming from because it's been painfully obvious the whole time](https://i.imgur.com/oBIEAaj.png)
---
fucking idiot
---
Just got back into eve, what‚Äôs the rubal report??
---
/r/titlegore
---
Pray tell how? I thought it was kinda cheeky.
---
Seems like most of the frat stuff is just leftovers from players who have quit the game, but their corp left Iron bank and joined frat, meaning all the losses show as frat ships. I highly doubt this explains anything about how frat makes isk.
---
I got plenty of hulls left in staging. Happy to continue the nightly work. 
---
I wonder which alliance's industry will best be able to keep up?
---
:munch:
---
So 6 rorqs and 20b huh. Cool.
---
Worthy of the upvotes
---
Google eve politician banned. CCP is doing a further investigation and say they are going to release a follow up statement this week.
---
Well, there's also the minor detail that the server is turned off.  Kinda makes it hard to play.
---
&gt;they don't count when you make "another" account.
---
How do they count it ? When a player finishes some tutorials or some goals ? When they finish career agent or two ? 
---
How exactly and precisely do they know which ones are new players and which ones are just auxilary toons that just sit there and train to their max 5 mil SP and may or may not see any use in the future many of which will be just multiboxed accounts or even bots ?
---
I lost a Malediction to rats a couple weeks ago. Network lag. Controls unresponsive, didn‚Äôt even realize they were there until I was already dead.

Didn‚Äôt have 35B in cargo though. That woulda‚Äô sucked.

Say that about NC. again and I'll report you for cyber bullying.
---
Only in highsec, and only for mining.
---
Why bother killing those instead of trying to extract them? Surely it would be worth the time for some of the blingier stuff
---
&gt;New players need a holding hand it is sad but true. They can't play a game when they don't watch 10 tutorials on youtbe 15 streams and a tutorial that explains them every mechanic in the game.
---
Conversely, old players are often just tools that are too dumb to recognize the fact and put up with unacceptable shit for years when they shouldn't. Take for example Eve whales and SC whales. One focuses on multi accounts and large plex purchases while the other literally on selling jpgs often for 100s and even thousands of dollars, but both are basically same shit just with different semantics.

---
While a game doesn't need a BR mode to be successful it does need to appeal to the pick up and play casual audience, which EVE does not.
---
The more hardcore players that can actually enjoy EVE have plenty of options to pick from nowadays, and a game that portrays itself as a spreadsheet simulator where upgrading from your little venture to a battleship seemingly takes months just isn't appealing for new players.
---
I'm not sure as they don't reveal that kind of stuff, most devs doesn't even reveal numbers so i guess its kinda understandable. But they have earlier released how many alts people have on average, which means they do have some kind of way to do it. 
---
Though its not really that hard; IP adress, mail, credit card etc. 
---
Or just the launcher
---
They could also just use a algorithm that factors inn stuff like character names, if you skip tutorial, where you get isk from, what you do in the beginning etc.
---
Congrats!
---
As a member of Signal Cartel, I can whole-heartedly recommend the corp if you are interested in solo exploration.  They are a super-nice bunch of people.  Don't hesitate!  Just apply!  You won't regret it.
---
P.S. I've learned to carry:  small armor repair, small hull repair, mobile depot, nanite paste.  I also tend to use a Magnate, because it is inexpensive (though I'm very wealthy), and has 3 low-slots for w-stabs.
---
Cannot disagree
---
signature radius is a bitch in bombing
---
Not to mention that 90% of the information out there is flat out wrong or heavily outdated. Most PVE wiki pages still recommend `priest + raven` setups...

Today is a bank holiday. No update until tomorrow, and quite likely not until Wednesday.

For me, I was at the board, but I didn't realise I'd set my autopilot to fastest instead of safest. Got caught by a gatecamp that had me cut down to basically zero speed and no warp before I could cloak. Twas a pity, but crap happens.
---
Which is why I'm thinking that I'm fairly limited with what I can hit obviously. Thinking about even running 2 at once maybe. Just to see what I can get.
---
No collusion
---
Or with other words they want someone to hold their hand?
---
What do you mean balancing ships by giving them god mode modules isn't the way to do it?
---
hussy
---
It is very doable. You need 3 bombers with all scorch or all shrapnel. All 3 need covops 4+, pref. 5+ to make sure.
---
TBH if I streamed, I'd simply be happy some people were watching my Twitch channel.
---
When starting out a new game, yeah I appreciate when the game explains stuff to me, or at least makes the information readily available.
---
I think it can be done however yes I think you need to run multiple smart bombs to get them to pop.
---
:(
---
I am not a big lore person so take anything I say with a grain of salt, but I dont think Concord really have much authority over the empires.
---
Concord has the ability to disable capsuleer ships built in to them which is why they can kill us so easily. Our sensors are also limited to only show other capsuleer ships. (even the npcs we kill are npc capsuleers)
---
Lore wise the empires are passively powerful and the capsuleers are absolutely no threat to their power. I think Jove meddling is really what has kept their power in check.
---
That‚Äôs one hell of a way to win this game
---
imagine not understanding that everyone who logs in at not the peak instant is ignored by using pcu as activity measure

According to CCPs most recent post on this particular subject matter, there is an average of 1.6 accounts per player logged in. Which means at prime time its around 1 out of 3 players and can go down to 1 out of 2.5 or maybe even 1 out of 2 in off time as players log off but bots / afk / automated accounts do not.
---
As for percentage of bots thats not very hard to figure out either. You have average 4k bots banned per month per CCP security log, you know that bots come back within few days or week at most meaning average monthly uptime of a bot is roughly 75%, so that means around 3k bots logged in guaranteed minimum. There is of course a lot more that they haven't banned or caught yet, but this is a pretty much guaranteed number.
---
So out of 30k logged in accounts, 3k are guaranteed bots and 7k are either multiboxed ,legit AFK players or bots, we do not have data available for further breakdowns, but this can give you fairly good idea.
---
This. People do say fitting and cap are a problem, but guess what, it‚Äôs a problem for every race when you‚Äôre just starting. If you stick with eve and plan on doing any type of combat content, you will train all your cap/engineering skills to V anyway so it‚Äôs a moot point. 
---
My advice is , go omega, pick one to focus on at first for pve purposes, but train all the races at least up to battleship IV and train all their frigates and cruisers to V. Yeah it‚Äôs a huge time commitment but at the end of the day you‚Äôll be able to hop in any ship and be effective. 
---
Focus on your missle and drone skills for combat at first, they are used on all the races ships (they all have missle boats) and get into gunnery and specific gun skills to level V once you know what you‚Äôre going to fly the most of.
---
Do people still not know you can remote activate large skill injectors?...from anywhere. Same with extractors. There is never a need to put them in cargo hold anymore.
---
Get our of here with your facts!
---
Correct,the drifter can point out to like 500km.
---
&gt;Most people doesn't even play every day, peak numbers one day doesn't say shit, you need to look at total   
---
&gt;unique  
---
&gt; numbers over at least a month before you get good statistics.
---
Do you have any idea how many alts I have ? I don't. Seriously. I have freagin alts I have made over the years to which I lost all info and will never log them in again.
---
I also have alts I log in on regular basis like 1-2 times a week, I also have alts I log in on irregular basis for 2-3 days at a time every 2-3 months, I also have alts that I barely log in at all, maybe once every half a year or so.
---
And all these are all counting towards that "unique" that you just brought up.
---
Are they?
---
I always upvote spaceballs the upvote.
---
You'll also want to fit torps and 2x target painter to make sure you finish the excavs.
---
I think the metaphor got away from you. This post means almost nothing.
---
So one thing that people should be at least in agreement about is that people like to get free things and some people like to tip money for free ingame items.
---
One option to level this across the board for all EVE Twitch streamers is for EVE to implement Twitch Drops - https://forums.eveonline.com/t/3rd-party-idea-for-eve-twitch-drops/6631 - which will automatically reward viewers who watch EVE ONLINE and have a EVE Online account connected with some ingame item over certain periods of time.
---
This was something that CCP Guard was supposedly looking into, but since he has left, not sure where this is anymore.
---
All I see is yet another large collidable object. Why do I have these on my overview anyway? /s
---
Yeh man i here you on that. And thanks man glad you enjoyed the video mate :)
---
I rather suspect that CCP are under pressure to make an announcement a little earlier than that.
---
Who?
---
Ultimately, it's CCP that has to build it's playerbase. But I would be remiss if I didn't mention the imporance that we, as a community, have on new player retention. It would benefit us in so many ways if we could encourage people to keep logging in.
---
"I am coming for you bitch" sounds like a RL threat to me "pop corn" time
---
Xtra squishy pussy?
---
Radakos more like Badakos
---
&gt; It reached it's peak from 2010-2014 at around 60k concurrent players
---
The thing that strikes me the most and makes a biggest practical difference between playing Eve back then and prior and now, is the amount of real active people vs multiboxed / afk / botted accounts we have now. This percentage seems to have gone up extremely. 
---
Sure, I had a cyno/scanning/scout alt, JF alt, mining / indy alt, but I almost never would have more then 2 accounts activated / logged in at once. There were no armies of AFK ratting VNIs etc., or at least no where near what we have today, they were exceptions not the rule. 
---
There were no mandatory fax alts, people more often then not worked and played together, like when I used my JF I had corp mates scout and cyno for me, I rarely used my alts. 
---
Nowadays multiboxing and "soft" multi account requirements have become de facto standards and it is bad. What new player as he or she advances through the game, sees this shit and realizes what it is, is going to stick around for it ? 
---
And here is the kicker, its the very "communities" that he mentions in the article, which have brought this into fruition.
---
And all those alts were on the same ip address as your other alts.
---
This isn't rocket science, for CCP to find out who owns a account is super easy.
---
Basically means a dead master and a dead slave are equally wealthy. So yeah, kill some masters.
---
Imaqtpie always catches me off guard.
---
Please tell me you got the other part of this ready for when the next post goes up :D
---
I've never done this exact thing, but I did once set up a route to a distant system, and get a suggested item to haul out there because of a buy order that was at the destination.
---
... Guess whose buy order that was?
---
I kinda hope he‚Äôs found innocent.
---
Enemy or not, it sucks to lose players.
---
But if he did do something wrong, then let the hammer fall
---
&gt; And all those alts were on the same ip address as your other alts.
---
LOL no. I have been using various VPNs for about a decade now, actually a bit longer started with just proxies, + I have moved 2 times and changed ISPs around 4 times + lost all my past e-mail info when I lost a computer + unfortunately my initial e-mails were created on ISPs that I haven't had for years and two of which are now out of business entirely.
---
i'll consider it in the future!
---
Yes. I know a guy who does it religiously in Delve. As sharnhorst said, there is a minimum bomber/skill need to get it done properly. Beyond that it will require a few extra characters for bridging and hunting/camping as well. The trick is find a miner who‚Äôs drones are traveling relatively far away from the ship so that they don‚Äôt get back in the ship before the bombs go off.
---
High production quality shit post wins the day
---
Well done!
---
lmao. I just love that he slowboated around the gate right into the bombers scram range instead of mwding
---
i just used deathrow as an example here so take any longterm jail sentence
---
Not really sure what you're really after here. Most players don't move around, changing ISPs etc more than maybe once in their entire life.
---
Casual gamers doesn't even play the same game for multiple years 
---
With all statistics you have margins of error, you're clearly a special case then and would probably have been counted several times, but CCPs numbers would still be close to correct.
---
DPS &gt;_&gt; lol
---
They can use the T2 guns but they can't get the important DPS skills up very high.
---
But Alphas can do a meaaaaaaan fucking orthrus, because they can use RLMLs
---
lol &lt;3
---
I hear Minmitar / Romulan relations have been a bit rocky. I'm sure they will sort it out so the romulans can update the cloaking technology.
---
I turned around to get back into optimal, and checked my alt in the Loki and saw the nemesis appear. I at no time did I ram into him on purpose. Yea I fucked up. Pretty sure I know that.

I'm sure we will see typical "politicians at work" behavior here where CCP will retract their statement but Brisc will say he intends not to return to the game ever again anyway thus avoiding admission but preserving his character from this "misunderstanding".

---
Have. A. Freaking. Upvote. grumble grumble
---
on pathfinder in the system you are scanning you can label the wormhole with what kind it is. it doesnt show up on the actual map though.
---
I hope he isn't found innocent, because that means we have a major policy problem at CCP and will draw in the question all past and future bans they did/do.
---
It also means if no other CSM members get the ban hammer it's apparently fine to use your position on the CSM to get players banned. 
---
Now the catch-22 there is if they do ban somebody from the CSM, it will have a real chilling effect on bringing up NDA violations in the future.
---
iBUYPLEX
---
No no :) No name removal. Is your work :)
---
By this logic so does siggy.
---
yep so everyone saves face and Brisc can repair his RL, like him or hate him ithe way ccp did this was wrong.
---
So all we can hope is that ccp has learned from this and in 5 years we an find out the truth.
---
If he's innocent let the hammer fall on the csm's that misled ccp into banning him in the first place
---
Yeah I figured that out.  I just really want them to show up on the map so I can look at the map and be like.  Hmm.  I have 2 4o unjumped holes and I just saw a ship on dscan.  Maybe I should go jump those and see if they are friendly.  Or whatever.  I just want it to show up on the map.
---
shut up, I can have you kicked out of any shitty little alliance your in just with a few words in discord, if you ever think about disrespecting me again I will deploy the full arsenal of the brutor tribe and evict your punk ass, even if your in a small 200 man alliance i dont care, even if your in the middle of the fucking delve i dont care.
---
Yes, it's very feasible. You need 5 scorch bombs to guarantee the kill on an excavator, less is possible with target paints. There are two ways to do it, either you keep all the bombers cloaked in system until the miners relax and then you bomb, that is how this guy does it https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98573571/
---
Alternatively you can do it the way I do it, in which case you additionally need a cyno and a bridger: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF9n8jXMgLU
---
On pathfinder there is an option for pasting the contents of your probe scanner window. Once you have entered that info you can set some details you do have for the wormhole signature.
---
Why does zkill show no value for abyssal modules? 
---
I get that each one is unique, but it ought to at least show the price of the base item.
---
I typically don't play games that can't be bothered to tell me what the basics of their ruleset is plainly, no. If having a functional tutorial to you is hand holding then I suggest you never go into game design.
---
Daddy, please come faster.
---
updoot for title and music
---
Because an abyssal mod may also be worth less than the base, zkill doesn't know.
---
tripwire might do that but pathfinder and siggy dont.
---
thank you kind sir :)

Yep, was a stupid comment and why I changed it. The internet is hard but you definitely still a douche, just didn't want to implicate all the internets.

I might have to.  But the UI on Pathfinder is so good.

Something. As you probably know, people tend to forget information that is of no immediate use.

They're on there just not seeded. You'd either have them when they cache the server, or you scan down data sites.

And yet you initially thought it was worth posting

Phew good thing you tackled that wreck! Loving these
---
I remember when I first started playing in late 2007 
---
I liked the sci fi
---
It was a bit steeper learning curve coming from StarWars Battlefront ll and Star Wars Empire at War. 
---
Had no prior PC gaming experience prior to aforementioned titles before playing EvE. 
---
Never really Quit the game. Took short breaks here and there. 
---
I remember nothing about the new player experience other than losses are permanent. 
---
12 years later - cant speak on new player experiences but i do try to make the game less harsh for newbros the rare times I log in, and the even rarer times I undock
---
Glad to see WIdot quality hasn't changed.
---
I propose new players enter Eve with text interface only. They will need to setup shaders and shit to be able to see.
---
I am actually starting to look to build a new PC and Eve is pretty much the main game I play so I am interested in what you build.  
---
Mind sharing?
---
The new player experience is shit because you login and you try to do some mining but then a catalyst sends you spinning, then you decide to go to nullsec with your brand new plexed ship and you end up with some guy saying China #1 or writing in cyrilics, you finally find your home in a wormhole with a bunch of bros but then they rob you and then stop playing.
---
Little AAR:  
---
We where there playing a little bit with some kitey stuff and saw the nyx next door but where unable to catch it the first time.
---
We then went back in our hole reshiped to something with a little more firepower and Logi.
---
Sabres go out towards the Super and see it warping away in the site leaving the fighters behind.
---
Nyx decided to warp to an Raitaru Sabre was able to get it bubbled!
---
Rest is in the video.
---
Enjoy!
---
And that, there, is the problem.
---
CCP somehow need to design a system that entices new players but still allows veterans to feel and be powerful. No wonder they've been fucking it up so much, it's an impossible challenge.
---
Seems like there's a bit more to this story...  
---
From an fb group:  
---
"they attacked our allies the recipient of that mail, after an introduction. Caused some diplo pain so a card was marked.  
---
Approx 36hrs ago, they were cleaned out by the Guild for approx 10bn, chump change really.   
---
Then following that warning the Co-CEO continued making threats in the mail attached... so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

It's fine it's not like he earned it lmao.
---
nice
---
Pretty sure on Pathfinder you can right click "set status" and that includes unscanned if I remember correctly.
---
This video was unironically really good.
---
Vi and some config files, all you really need
---
I feel like if CCP had full confidence in their decision they would have said so and said why based on all the hoopla.  They didn't and subtly said they will apologize if necessary.
---
Anchorable objects, mjd,citadels, blops, ecm, XL Cruise missiles,  bombs,  faction supers, war decs, suicide ganking .   . . .
---
Well they never really did anything to his personal life he‚Äôs the one that doxxed himself. I personally like the guy so don‚Äôt confuse me with the haters. I‚Äôm just pointing out the obvious even though I hope he will continue to play.

Well that is a case of Loot fairy saying FUCK YOU......

right but that doesnt display unjumped holes on the map

Even greater to borrow one to such pilot.

Hey squishy !
---
I often see you going around when I‚Äôm dirty VNI spinning :)
---
So... I‚Äôm interested in nullsec PvP. Yeah, can‚Äôt really awox the guys from INIT because I have stuff there lol, but do you have any advices to give to a newcomer on the PVP scene please ?
---
I‚Äôd like to use an Algos, and maybe a Brutix later (when I‚Äôll have the skills not to welp it every time, if I ever get dem skills) :)
---
And nice vid as always !
---
CSM member named brisc rubal got banned for allegedly violating his nda allowing some of his corp mates to do some insider trading. After community backlash from the lack of information in the initial ban report ccp announced that they are going to do a 2nd investigation and presumably release more details.
---
This has been a bit of a drama storm because the community is pretty divided on if they believe brisc is innocent or not.
---
Mad props for undocking it tbh. People just ree because they wish it was them flying the Moracha. (Ngl kind of wish I was the one flying that ship)
---
I think he's using a detonator clacker for a military claymore mine as a mouse...
---
Hello, fellow Minmatar!
---
lol l didn't mean it that way, l just wanted to add to what you said ^^
---
Ah my mistake sorry =p
---
Icelandic tentacle monsters what?
---
Hope you fly Gallente as it p as it's with the new neon skins
---
Abyssal mods have no intrinsic value because the functionally infinite spread of stat change combinations means that you would have to plot across a virtually infinite set of possible sell values -- or more specifically, have market windows a mile long as every unique abyssal mod will be alone in its category.
---
Alternatively, the simpler explanation: the same reason BPCs aren't given a value, because they are not directly marketable.
---
meh lol
---
more just mildlyinteresting
---
Thanks for a neat bit of history and new wallpaper :)
---
Its cheaper to apologize if enough goons clamor about it even if he is guilty
---
You can fake this in pathfinder. 
---
Add the system PE1-R1 (Jove space), and relabel it "NOT JUMPED" or "???" or whatever you want.
---
I use wallpaper engine from steam to make a couple of videos of EvE stuff for my windows backrounds- [https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper\_Engine/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/)
---
i dont understand what you're trying to convey here but yes all of those are things that needed to be iterated on that didn't
---
Yeah mad props for undocking in someone else's 500bill ship
---
It‚Äôs not good. It‚Äôs just modern looking. Switch to Tripwire and be amazed at the productivity changes. :)
---
I wanted an easter event and I'm very disappointed in CCP for not giving us one.
---
He didn't build it, it's a pre-built machine. Ibuypower is an OEM
---
I'm sincerely not sure how I 'want' the investigation to go, other than the truth (whatever it may be) to be the deciding factor.
---
Personally, I feel like unless they have iron-bound proof that Brisc was saying something like "buy up X module asap, it's a great investment if you catch my drift", it's entirely subjective and situational whether there was actually insider trading going on. People hop on all sorts of trends all the fucking time, and while I'll admit it is mildly suspicious that other senior Init members (apparently/allegedly) happened to buy into the same stock that also happened to be a thing that soared in prices due to a game change talked about at CSM, it could also be a freak coincidence, and/or one person going "hey, let's corner the market on X, I feel like it's gonna blow up soon" and convincing a couple other people to do so.
---
However, on the flip side there is the oddly specific discussion of CSM members having phones or other electronics on hand in council, which seems so incredibly pointed as to indicate it has something to do with what's supposed to have occurred.
---
It's like that one skit from I think season one of MADTV (I know that's really specific, but I had it on DVD, sue me): the hotel receptionist is talking to a guest about going into a pool and has a comedically long and specific list of prohibited activities for poolgoers. It's played for laughs of course, but as the guest remarks, "you wouldn't have these rules if someone hadn't done these things in the first place".
---
Like I said, whatever the truth ends up being, I hope that's what any follow-up judgments are based on. If it means CCP eating crow, so be it, I'd rather they do that than unjustly wield absolute punishments in this game due to circumstantial evidence.
---
Heh. I remember fighting against that in my scimitar in amamake. I was just really impressed he undocked it!
---
I have to check that part...still nothing I have done it fixed, checked roles, they dont have roles...its been over 24 hours, yet they still here, cant even put them on Auto removal... sent a ticket to CCP...nothing yet...
---
Unfortunately, I agree....
---
Congratulations, OP, you paid some company several hundred dollars to mediocrely assemble (look up negative feedback of IBP and other "we build it" 'custom' computer places) a computer when you could have just bought the parts and put it together within an hour, maybe two (assuming zero computer building experience) with the help of YouTube and Google.

Nope.  Been in Origin. for months and I‚Äôm eu TZ.  My sleeping pattern however...

Agreed
---
No report until they finish the pile of cocaine in CCP hq.
---
I love your qualifying statement.
---
I've built about 5 so far in my life and every single one, from my first painful attempt when I was in college about 10 years ago to my current build I smashed together last summer, has managed not to somehow go bad on me.
---
A tiny argument could be made that IBP et al test their builds before they're sent out, but one could just as easily RMA any component that was doa. Again, when 10%+ of the value of the build itself is on the line, I'd rather wait a week or two to RMA to Newegg or whatever than pay the extra to save myself some time.
---
Right after the successor to the Switch is announced.
---
Cool
---
sad thing is he‚Äôs dead serious
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
Yet Provi still cant end the HTP PHEW oppression. You think Simple Farmers and FRT will team up to assist in such a venture?
---
A lack of success doesn't mean it's not an issue.
---
I'm fairly new to the game. Character is like 9 years old sure, but i only recently started to actually _play_ the game and all these changes that you are proposing for the game would completely kill it.
---
Sure, there are people who like to play safe and not do PVP, but there is absolutely nothing in the game stopping them from doing that. I myself kinda like mining and general logistics, but it would be incredibly boring to know that there was absolutely no risk invovled.
---
Now while i'm mining, or exploring, i keep my dscan open and i constantly pay attention to my surroundings to make sure i can do that without engaging in PVP. 
---
&gt; For those players out there that have played games like rift, world of warcraft, guide wars 2, they will understand this by simply calling to mind an demonstration of those statistics when they think the answer to the question "how many pve servers are there compared to pvp servers".
---
Dumbest comparison ever. For example, Battle for Azeroth in WoW got rid of PvE/PvP specific servers, so that _every_ server is essentially PVP and it rewards you for keeping the PVP flag on.
---
Guild Wars 2 was never a PVP game to begin with (ok it tried but the sPVP in it sucked ass compared to GW1). I bet you the structured PVP in GW2 would have been bigger, if it wasn't so lackluster at release. Just look at Guild Wars 1, it had VERY popular and liked PVP modes and it was big in that game, because it was good.
---
Also just so you know, GW2 has no separate PVE / PVP servers, because there is no open world PVP. But guess what servers are always full (as in, can't make new characters) and why they are full? They are full because of World vs World, pvp. Those are the biggest "pvp" servers in the game.
---
EVE however, has been marketed as pretty much purely PVP and honestly, its the best i have ever experienced, i have never played an mmo where the player interaction is as deep as this game. So please don't ruin it, thanks.
---
Same, someone put an impressive amount of work into this.
---
A daytripping nullsecer? Why do you make such an assumption? 
---
Who are you even?
---
One tries to make a thought out post to address an issue and all he gets in response are presumptuos nobodies spewing uninformed nonsense and absolutely horrible trolling attempts.
---

/r/rareinsults
---
Its, bad but it's not JTclone bad.
---
In nullsec, absolutely. For new players who don't go to null, they usually quit from being ganked or wardeced in hisec.
---
I don't think ganking in hisec is bad, but I do think there isn't really much counterplay besides fitting better tank. Previously suicide ganks were about profit in looting the wrecks, but nowadays ganks happen even if there's no profit at all.
---
I'm in complete agreement about megablocs suppressing the playerbase in null. In addition to adding distance and stagnation, they also actively prevent smaller groups from setting up in the space they occupy (or more likely reserve for renters).
---
The fact that someone considers this kind of content fun turns my stomach.

This guy lost 123 dreads, 119 carriers, 11 rorquals and 4 supers in the last 2 years.
---
So, like 10 minutes after downtime...
---
&gt; I forgot option 4: CCP gonna CCP
---
In my mind the most likely the scenario has always been that #4 is this particular variation of #1. 
---
1) CCP have watertight evidence that Brisc spoke to people outside of the CSM about matters *NOT* under NDA - But however well intentioned they mistakenly thought it *was* under the NDA. 
---
Or perhaps their evidence wasn't water tight but circumstantial and they thought he shared something specific covered by the NDA but he really said something different and not covered. Since they didn't talk to him there's a lot of room for misunderstanding and mistaken assumptions to go uncorrected. 
---
It just seems a very real possibility to me that a lawyer actually understood the NDA provisions better than the laymen who accused him of violating it. I think the apparent backpedalling by CCP is a result of their lawyers being called in to look at it now and telling CCP they need to take down the original public announcement in the meantime.
---
Anything but "yeah we were right, and triple double checked because of RL implications" is gonna be some suuuuuuper spicy drama that I'm all about.
---
Been suggested a hundred times before.
---
I hope CCP introduces Iepetian titans for players to fly. Imagine the ticks they would get. Wipe out all anoms in system with one DD.
---
RMT fair.good jobs to ccp.successful than someone got the loot. LOL for xix.
---
As someone who religiously used to build their own machine, I just purchase ibuypower now.  It's worth paying $20 for them to assemble just so I don't have that dreaded feeling of nothing happening when I press the power button and troubleshooting, returning mobos for RMA, etc.  
---
Just buy it barebones and put your own memory/gpu/and ssd in, easy.  I've easily done this 5 times now, have 2 6-core I7s from them and they are working great, my bro has an I5, etc.

Great attitude. I spent quite a while in FW and thoroughly enjoyed it. Some of the best PvP I've had in my years of service, especially small gang stuff. Enjoy the heck out of it!

Yeah because that works for CCP and goon impact on their business model.  The goonspiracy is strong with you sir.
---
Someone once told me 10 years ago "a fleet isn't a real fleet unless Radakos dies". Im glad that this holds true to this day.
---
Nostalgic btw.
---
I think you're wrong from a lore perspective; light already in the star system would be visible to a ship calibrating it's sensors on jump in, so it would be pretty easy to pick up on ( a lot of space fleet SciFi novels focus on this element as a tactical advantage).
---
If anything, to adhere with lore, ships jumping into the system should have a small advantage before they appear in local, as light would take longer to travel to ships already in the system.
---
But since everything in EVE basically operates faster than the speed of light anyway not sure how applicable this would be.
---
DST all the way for this. Tank it up and it'll be fine. AFAIK you won't fit 3 cruisers in a blockade runner.
---
Starts playing Eve October 2018, joins Pandemic Horde 5 days later. Comments gEt GuuD...
---
TBH, I heard that Guristas hate Jesus - probably the reason they dont celebrate.
---
Hope you feel better.
---
Okay. But your sensors are limited to 14ish AU... So you would need to sync with the gate in order to get a list of everyone who's in system and haven't left yet.
---
One could say that you can automatically have local populate anyone who is within D-Scan range, but you'll need to decloak to get the full list.  Would this work?
---
Man, all these bads killing off my karma. I better go back to r/FreeKarma4U to get my karma back up
---
How drunk does one have to be to loan you an AT ship ? 30 seconds on Zkill shows you have no idea what you‚Äôre fucking doing.
---
What's the objective you're after? You want people already in the system to have a slight advantage over those entering it?
---
&gt; you won't show up in local up to 1 minute depending on how long you hold  cloak after you jump into system. This gives hunters a chance to dscan  the vicinity and pick a victim

if you multibox a lot, buy more RAM. I've got a 1070ti/32g ram and I can run 5 clients in high detail with only some minor FPS drop. Moving clients to low/medium detail clears up all the performance issues, and I've run 8 clients before w/o problems.

&gt;something pretty much useless on an interceptor.
---
Ummm, it was not useless. It gave him a bit bigger sig thus the rats that popped him had an easier time locking on.
---
&gt; Do you really need to Buy injectors more expensive ?
---
Be it lazyness, missing knowledge about game mechanics or something else, overpriced injectors in nullsec tradehubs sell well.
---
Generally in a solo Venture you want to ninja-mine, that is you mine for 15 minutes or so till the rats spawn then leave.
---
You can also come back in a bigger ship and kill them, then switch and keep mining.
---
It may still be possible to just speed-tank them too. At least it used to be.
---
I have seen it claimed that some gas sites can be speed tanked with a 10mn ab, don‚Äôt know if the AB are Omega locked though.
---
Honest answer is either have friends who can kill the rats or warp out. Venture can't tank its way out of a wet paper bag.
---
&gt;warping to 10 on a gate will put you right ontop of a SB battleship lol.
---
Sometimes. I have jumped SB camps by simply coming in at different angle. I rarely get popped, only if I get lazy  or have nothing to lose therefore not care enough to be vigilant.
---
You should bug out when rats show up and find the next cloud to harvest.
---
How are you going to post a PC and not include the specs.
---
doesnt even matter much either way. not blue shoot it.

yeah and i think you could still fit a decent shield buffer on it. not that you'd need it, considering you're webbing from 170km away.

&gt;Foreign companies often have to "make difficult choices about managing the trade-off of technology sharing and market access," said Parker, the US-China Business Council executive. He said that about a fifth of American companies operating in China have been asked to transfer technology to Chinese partners in the past three years.
---
I'm guessing you don't read a lot of news, because it's been widely reported in mainstream business news the entire last decade (whether true or not) that China has been forcing companies (under threat of very heavy tariffs) to partner with domestic firms, and often to transfer technology to them. Not so much in the last year or two due to the China's slowing growth, but it was a major thing at the turn of the last decade.
---
You know the whole story already friend. Front to back..  I'mma let you, do you.  O7
---
Great picture!
---
Remember when razor existed?
---
Last time i did something like that, was the following... As soon as i saw some buggers show up, i let them get a bit closer, up to gun fire range, and then just speed into one direction and let them follow you, when they are over a couple of hundred km away or so, you align back to the zone and warp in, this should give you more time to mine a few more chunks.
---
Ppl sell them on the market I bought 20 electric ones for 2bill, only a few for sale I wanted to try a few others but no luck getting them.
---
I don't use afterburners anymore ever since i discovered the micro warpdrives, those things make you go FAAAAAST
---
Buy my plex thanks
---
Fire is legacy
---
Hm very big price difference tho
---
Average eve player only has 2 accounts. That's only 30 bucks a month less if buying longer. Been awhile since I looked but p sure you can't even "play" star citizen for that. If you want a single decent star citizen ship to walk around in a hanger you gotta spend as much as you would spend on an eve sub for a full year
---
Yea, but they bloom your signature radius, the sleepers will blast you.
---
The normal AB for a frig like the venture would be the 1MN, if you can JUST fit the 10MN, normally fit on a cruser, you will go around 100m/s with no increase in signature, making you very hard to shoot, just don‚Äôt get webbed.
---
They just keep getting better and better :)
---
&gt;This is not surprising at all. A lot of new players are turned off by the long skill training.  
---
&gt;Newbie: "Hey this ship looks really cool. How long do i need to train for it? ... 2 months???"  
---
&gt;EVE: You can skip training time with skill injectors.  
---
&gt;Newbie: "Sounds great. How much? ... 8 bill ISK or 80$?? That is so expensive!! Fuck this shit im out"  
---
&gt;If CCP really wants to keep new players, they have to rework the skill training. Just remove filler skills like the magic 14. In tutorial show them the basic roles/directions of EVE players like tackling, brawling and logi, then give them a bunch of SP and some pointers to PvP resources (i.e. Suitonia vids) to jump start their favorite role/direction.
---
heh, if it only were 2 months. 
---
but yea, game would be a lot better if it had a reworked skill system, hell, it could even be reworked to include some serious active gameplay in order to make botting more difficult at the same time.

You can kill up to badly fit dsts with 3 vexors, a well tanked one will need more, same with tornadoes. Mallers are only really useful for smartbombing pods and stuff, and I‚Äôve never heard of Caracals being used, though I know Moas are used to kill pods

Separate the PVP and PVE activities in their own sub categories.

Don't let people recruit for every single tz. Make it a single choice

This is really great and I hope this gets people on it.

Extract and send the isk to me. üëç

&gt; who haven't donated. u/CCP_Falcon, What say you
---
Lol Falcon say contact us and we can determine whats right, but then ignores a direct request...
---
Number 2 is actually fine... 
---
Show me in the monetization policy where it states this is not ok
---
That is your view..

Moracha more like Lessacha.

Not sure about Skill Urself and not sure what changed in the last week but last I remember Fraternity was blue'd to Horde as they showed up in friendly tab and not combat.

Donut crying about the other donut

As already mentioned, /r/buildapc is a good place to look if you are willing to build your own PC ( EVE has some... unusual requirements, especially for multiboxing, so I‚Äôd suggest building yourself). If you just want to go for a prebuilt Box then /r/suggestapc works though it‚Äôs a bit inactive.

More like a good cpu.

"We break for Rorquals" and then "confirmation bias" was where this GIF earned gold.
---
Not for nc. And pl at least
---
Horde is much larger so it might be harder to just say "don't shoot those guys" i guess

This barely made my dick move.   Low quality shitpost, please try again.

Kinda repeating what dirge said, but, back in the olden days, you could only get Cyto in the NS constellations, and Myko in the LS constellations.  I don't remember the LS spawns, but, if I remember correctly, each NS constellation would contain 1x 9k site, 1x 3k site and 2x 1k site.  Or it might have been 2x 3k sites?
---
When Apocrypha came out in '09, the distribution of these sites changed.  The sites in the 8 NS constellations were unchanged, but 500 unit Cyto sites could now spawn in LS.
---
Furthermore, lower tier sites could spawn throughout the NS regions (LS as well, but fuzzy on the details as I only ever did NS stuff).  I'm not sure if it was limited to just 1k sites, or also included 3k sites, but 9k were always restricted to the region's COSMOS constellation.  And, obviously, it would be harder to track them down.
---
If you've got four sites available across a constellation of 6-7 systems ... well you're more than likely to find one in the system you're in and farming them will be a piece of cake seeing as as soon as you clear one, it spawns again somewhere in the constellation.
---
But one site, maybe two, across a constellation?  Not so easy.

I feel ya.   I have built a few PCs and, in another life, worked in design and manufacture of electronics but if it takes me 2-3 hours to assemble and troubleshoot a build, it is well worth my time to pay someone to do it.  
---
If it literally costs me more money to build it myself, why shouldn't I pay someone else to do it?
---
Is it possible to practice c5 dread ratting on SiSi and how would one go about doing that?
---
That would go to Casper24.
---
I mean... WHAT.. WHY.. would anyone lend Rakados a fucking AT ship, Casper bro.. you must be of your tits.
---
Skill urself gilabrain
---
I know people who would gank an anti-tanked battleship on principle even if it was empty. Always use the right ship for the job. If in doubt ask, "What would James 315 do?"
---
Might have been flairbaited, or not really known what lumpy is up to these days. My apologies if I was wrong about that part. Also didn't know you had to be a somebody in eve to post opinions, so once again I apologize  for that.
---
I have mainly piloted frigs in lowsec and quite a bit of that have been solo. Been baited by recons in mediums, lokis outside plexes, cloaked ships inside plexes and lots of other stuff. So yeah, I know what pains you have endured. But much like freighterbumping in highsec, its a part of the game, and something you have to learn to avoid.
---
I take note of the names of the pilots that does crap like that and stop giving them content if I see them in system. And after a while it gets pretty predictable.
---
And to the guy who said I know nothing about FW, you are totally right. I could honestly not care less about FW (not in a bad way btw, it just doesn't interest me). But I know enough about lowsec by now that I rarely get baited into traps in plexes anymore, and only occasionally killed by gateguns.
---
It's me, casper24.

&gt;The people who stick around are attracted by complex puzzles and even more complicated mechanics. We figure shit out on our own, and then figure out five different ways to break it to give us an advantage. Plus an unusually large number of pure sociopaths, hah.

Brisc Rubal can eat a dick.

Literally the day before he died I was talking on BSB implying that he would die in a fire promptly. Didn‚Äôt realise it would be this prompt.
---
Also, Casper man, when will you learn. You can only trust your ships to the real sweaty tryhards like myself.
---
Zkill does its best to portray an accurate value with the information it is given. The API provides no information other than the name of the module. It could be a perfect roll or a worthless dud. Only CCP can fix this by improving the killmails to include module attributes, and making it accessible via API. There is a killmail revamp in the works with no ETA.

If we get gigx back can we also get Nolak Ataru

Your post is bad and you should feel bad.  Back to runescape you to bro.

But if we are red on their overview, we get a 10% velocity boost!
