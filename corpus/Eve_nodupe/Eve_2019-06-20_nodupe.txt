Good news! We here at CCP have listened to your cries about the status quo!
---
Team Balance 3.0 will be adding 6 new mining capitals with bonuses ranging from mining speed, mining range, panic duration, number of ships affected by panic, and of course, mining quantity per second. We believe these will bring more interesting and meaningful gameplay to New Eden.
---
Team Deploy This will be adding a new BPC available only from rare Sanctum anomaly NPC drops that manufactures 1000 Scrap Metal into an anchorable, mineable asteroid! Now you and your friends don't even have to leave tether range to have some fun.
---
Finally, Team Artistry in Motion is proud to announce mining laser skins, which change the color and density of all mining lasers equipped on your ship. However, due to the incredible number of color combinations provided by modern video cards, we will wait until all 1.073 billion colors are ready before releasing the skins on the New Eden store.

v0v, it works for me and has been pretty accurate when I use both.
---
My guess is you genuinely don't understand why some people play this game. An entire alliance vanished with the phoebe jump changes.
---
Do you think that removing supers, titans and rorqs wouldn't cause the same?
---
So sure, it'd solve a lot. It'd probably be the actual death of Eve.
---
Should we go back in time and not have ever had supers to begin with? Probably. But we can't.

500 Million is the price of a Raitaru, this should be sufficient.

i'm pretty sure 75% of the pcu are bots or alts

that's a lot of words i'm not going to read so i'll just tell you to fuck off
---
Lol the irony of you accusing someone else of ignoring what you're saying.
---
Holy tits
---
I really liked the sweaty frog.  That and the music totally set the mood =)
---
Can you imagine Homeworld 2 with these graphics?
---
CCP needs an entire group just for dealing with this sort of crap. I do think bots are hurting eve.
---
No, those strictly affect mining laser yield. Drone Interfacing upgrades the yield of mining drones though!
---
Goons didn't do anything but recognize the direction the winds were blowing when CCP finally did something to get mining out of high sec. It just took everyone else far too long to do the same thing.
---
Take part in the EvE Logout on Monday June 24. and show CCP and Pearl Abyss that the community cannot be taken for granted.
---
ive already quit the game my friend
---
HAHAHA! I'm a security architect and was a security manager before that so you are pretty close!
---
I agree. The main issue is that CCP does not communicate with its community very well. Paradox Interaction for example, despite its faults, will post weekly their summaries about what they are working on and where they want to go. I think having a weekly podcast from CCP about development progress and where they are going and what they think about affairs would be nice.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Another major issue is the bias towards large alliances. This could have been stopped eight years ago but due to their reluctance to implement ways for smaller groups to fight larger groups more effectively, the developers are being held hostage by 40% of the playerbase in nullsec. Any new changes to their space would result in them leaving the game and a loss of revenue.
---
It is almost sad, but this is why having only one Sandbox MMO in space breeds this kind of decision making. There is no other game like Eve to contest this one and when this happens the product suffers.
---
I love Eve, nothing really like it exists, but knowing that we live in a Sandbox that is limiting basically brings us back into real-life. IRL we cannot individually change the entire world anymore, but in gaming we deserve a place for us to be true heros of a larger story, Eve I found has lost this aspect in some way for me but I keep playing :)

Before POS goes offline because of lack of fuel blocks it sends a ton of pings that it is running out of fuel. As for taking it down without them noticing, not only do they get a ping that it is being attacked, but it also goes into reinforcement for a maximum time of over 2 days depending on how much stront is in the POS.
---
Yed
---
Or that, maybe.
---
Yeah....that's what I'm afraid of...
---
Drugs hello?
---
What happened? Did doom quit?  
---
With goons steamrolling over everything, it's sad to see the state of things nowadays.
---
I like how you know what I'm talking about just by my saying "the word gigaton is used a lot."
---
That series, man.
---
The world Ark is just the largest site. It appears to respawn every couple of hours. It would seem that the goal is to have some fleets taking on majors some fleets taking on minors and then several fleets can work together on the world Ark. we had over 30 people in the site and got a 19 million isk payout
---
I just built my first gaming pc a couple weeks ago and have always wanted to try Eve because I was always seeing news articles about giant battles and stuff.
---
say what you like about doom, but he was into this game big time, and 2-3 years of patches later he's not. what does that tell you?
---
Ciapek killed pl by recruiting doom
---
19 Mio lmao
---
That's not a lot, what's the effort like?
---
You mean the two titans that got awoxed by friendly fleetwarps? If that's the most fun Gewns have then I feel sorry for them.
---
The game is only fun for him when he's the one with supercap superiority ?
---
&gt;That's been the case forever
---
wtf did titans matter post dominion pre citadel?
---
If its the player's responsibility to keep the playerbase afloat, the developers have failed.
---
The site states it is for 10 people and I am low-balling my estimate. in addition to that we got about two and a half billion desk 4th of estimated loot and salvage which will probably be around 2 billion desk it took us around 30 minutes though to be fair that salvage also came from two or three majors.
---
It's been out of control up there. I went up fade the day before last and noticed a severe decrease in botters. Maybe CCP had done a mass ban. Last week there was about 5 bots per system, it was crazy.
---
&gt;For what it brings to the game, it should be as easy as ozone, (insert cyno ship name here), titan bridge/capital jump,  and random numbers. I agree it should be a more complex task to pull off for the power projection it brings.
---
Isn't that just a contradiction?
---
You recognise that power projection is important, and it needs to have some extra complexity to achieve. 
---
But then you say it should be as simple as; fuel, beacon, jump-drives, and a little bit of randomness.
---

Nah, this game gets money from the quality players that have been around for literal decades. The quantity carebears that are in for a few months and then leave again don't create the community that makes this game what it is. If the money is the only argument you have, I guarantee every veteran player that you say is "killing" this game with their attitude has spent 10x+ the amount those new players ever would.
---
Fozzie made a [forum post](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/summer-2019-new-pirate-implant-sets/149867) about it a few months back. No updates since then as far as I have seen.

imagine being this mad at someone you dont interact with
---
What should new players do? join small to mid sized groups with no sp and isk and get turbodunked over and over again by the huge null blocks. Does that sound like a fun and engaging NPE?
---
Finding a good LP store and agent is the main priority.  Between the nightmare and the rattlesnake you should be able to do every mission just fine. Caldari space has a lot of missions that lasers do well in, there's only a few gurista/angel missions and the rattlesnake should do great there. If you can use a t2 drake you should probably have access to t2 rapid heavy missile launchers which should work fine on the rattle, or even just meta 4 cruise launchers. 
---
If you have good frig/cruiser skills you can start working on the burner missions as they pay out very well and can be completed quickly.
---
Imagine when this subreddit will move past this already-tired meme of starting a comment with the word “imagine” so as to seem sassy.

Here is the difference,  yes we poke fun at dumb asses for being in shiny toys when told you shouldn’t.   We don’t kick people from corp and alliance for losing their space pixels.

Not to mention, with CSM happening these days, it's good timing.

Whooooosh

---
Walking in stations
---
Use a fleet ceptor or cloakey nullified T3C or Luxury Yacht for traveling in nullsec
---
As someone who was there, I can say it was pretty fun even if the payout was next to nothing. We had a fleet of approximately 60 kitchen sink shield bs and lower, with 8+ basi logi support. Besides us there was at least 2 other 10+ man fleets, including one that was made up of mostly marauders. And then on top of that there were ninja salvagers everywhere.
---
I'm guessing that the payout was split between around 120 people, maybe a few more or less, so we all knew going into it that we were probably not going to get paid. The site itself was i'd say about 3-5x harder than a major, I think the group of ~10 marauders had to warp off until our larger fleet came in and could take some agro.
---
With an optimized group and a system that isnt "ermagerd first world ark" full, then i think you could probably do it with a 15-20 man bs/cruiser fleet. Then the payout/salvage would definitely be worth it.
---
Awesome! Keep trying and keep up the great attitude. It will take you farther than anything else
---
Yeah maybe you should run for CSM too then.
---
Naw, there is a ton of content and folks having fun in eve. Just not in the loser north.

This nowhere near Cymek quality, not a bad knockoff though

It's easy if you try

FWIW I had the same problem yesterday and I'm 99% sure it was a Spectrum DNS issue

---
Some /r/iamverysmart shit right there.
---
Holy shit you actually went there to condemn the phrase that both CCP and the community created in recognition of the greatest part of this game?
---
I didn't say they backstabbed. I said they seal clubbed.
---
You're dead set on making what I wrote out to be something you wanted to read because you wanted to get mad at it. Idk why, but that's on you man.
---
As someone who's been both the seal and the clubber in various games it was a wakeup call to realize that you aren't elite, you're just an asshole. It's no surprise the seals teamed up to stomp out the NCPL clubbers and that doesn't have shit to do with backstabs or any of that conspiracy nonsense.
---
One can only hope NCPL goes through the same growth, but I rather seriously doubt it.
---
They are still cruisers carrying battleship sized tank and t2 cruiser class dps while cloaking.... I love to fly my Loki and I really don't think removing the SP loss would be able to make me fly it more.

I might do the opposite as I will be unable to see anything else in space and will turn to trying to effectively counter them with a cruiser.

You're still a fuck nugget. More news at 11.
---
&gt;You haven't actually used the concept of opportunity cost anywhere in your post, which makes me think you may not know what it means.
---
 "people would just shift by producing the "new" biggest ship available with the "new" best mining ship. This literally wouldn't solve anything."
---
Err? Is the concept of building and fielding the next best thing not opportunity cost lmfao?
---
&gt;If supercaps disappeared, suddenly the playing field would be dramatically more even because everyone, or nearly everyone, would have access to the top tier of ships in numbers that would make them practically useful.
---
This honestly made me facepalm so hard. So you want the "top tier" ships to be easier to get in, cheaper to make, and easier to proliferate? The leap between cap and super is huge, but so is the leap between subcaps and caps. This change would probably make subcaps *even more useless* considering any perfect skilled subcap can't beat a basic skilled cap in equal numbers.
---
&gt;This is a logical fallacy. That's like saying that if people knew how to solve polio there wouldn't be a million different homeopathic vaccine alternatives being peddled.

No, no it isn't. Go take a lap.

Doom has his faults, but he's okay.
---
there's a ton of alternate fits for most burners if you only want to shield tank you can probably find something for most of them. Although for a decent armor tank you only need ~1mil SP so shouldn't take too long to get going on that. There's a ton of fits on the forums https://forums.eveonline.com/t/burner-mission-ship-advice-to-solo-them-including-fittings/9580
---
I know a lot of people expressed resentment towards Doom's character and personae in game.
---
But regardless of where you stand, I still strongly believe that polarising personalities like his are what Eve storis are made of.
---
How many people still dislike Mittens by principle, or remember the explosive moods of Shadoo?
---
Everytime a person like that leaves the game, it loses some of its history and narrative.
---
What happens when PGL is gone? And Sort? And Mittens?
---
Food for thought I guess, but it makes me sad for the game as a whole.
---
Not big if true, irrelevant since 2016.

It should be noted that when you do form a small fleet to roam null you tend to get over escalated and have to leave without getting good content.

A Titan is not the correct response to 5 assualt frigates.

Actually amazing analogy. OP is either a fucktard or (more likely) a troll that is baiting us like a savant.

How is it still going ?
---
To follow up on that. As long as you put 3 inertia stabs in the lows and your align time is under 2seconds you really only have to worry about smart bomb camps in the above ships. Happy travels
---
The game *is* amazing. Not as amazing as it used to be, not as amazing as it has been promised, not as amazing as it should be, but amazing none the less. Op is full of shit, but hes newly full of shit. There is a ton of game to discover, they are probably going to drop $200 into the game, survive two expansions and post about how shit the game has gotten. That doesnt mean that the fun pats of the game dont exist.
---
Imagine thinking that's unique to r/eve

What do you mean, depreciated? You can play DX9 titles on modern GPUs, it’s not like they’re going to just stop supporting DX11 any time soon.

Why not just make titans and supercapitals more expensive? Triple their resource requirements.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
People whine but I like the timer based warfare.  Fits better with a work schedule.  Game has plenty of problems but citadels aren’t one of the big ones.
---
Eh, supercapital hunting suffers more from them no longer being all that valuable to be worth the effort and in my area of space some of the most dedicated hunters decided to focus on IRL instead.  
---
Proliferation of them has made movement more common and it was mostly the stupid or impatient super pilots that got caught anyways, so they still get caught even with citadels being a thing.
---
Dude, first you call me a 22 chromosomed failure, then back off, now brochacho. Lemme break it down for you. Shit isn’t the same it has been for the last 12 years.

So jump fatigue caused 20-30k pilots to stop playing? Or do you wanna trot out some other shit excuse (ppl left cause walking in stations were abandoned or some other shit excuse)
---
You can be an asshole and plug your ears, you can scream “Reeeeee”, you can do whatever makes you feel like you won some weird debate.

I honestly just started paying attention to Eve after 19 months - I mean, not to play it, but to look at the politics. I thought this was the typical "End game affair" that had littered Eve subreddit for awhile, until this post. Maybe there's actualy some quality. "Eve is Dying" shit going on.  
---
Comically, all of us bittervets that have retired are hoping Eve dies, just so we can scream. "SEE ITS X THAT DID IT IN." depending on which year we all decided to call it quits. Honestly though, it was a lot of little changes that caused the majority of the oldschool playerbase to leave.
---
Eeh probly for the best. I could see good things coming from alliance breaking apart for others to rebuild.
---
This shit right here should be the inspiration for all warp, jump and bridge animations.

Idk what you mean Mittens is an upstanding guy who would never entice an entire group of people to push a suicidal person over the edge.

This is a sad day Doom but now you can just chill and enjoy the sun. Welcome to the winners of eve club ♥

The old moa was an abortion of a ship, though the old scorp was neat

In PL's defense - and this isn't really much defense, but hear me out.

Everytime Goons knock over an alliances sandcastle, the alliance gets buthurt - but the crabs that built that sandcastle get sad and want to build another without having a jerk to knock it over, so they join Goons to build another mighty sandcastle. Goons wrecks more sandcastles, gets more crabs. etc. etc.  
---
Goonswarm for many years have been a 'safe' entity in Eve, since their dominance over BoB they are a mainstay of Eve Online. People see them as assholes, yes, sometimes, but also safe, as far as crabbing. The comical thing is, I have had friends in Goons that didn't give a fuck what war was going on where, they were just building and maxxing shit.

I agree with this. I don’t know him, but I will miss having him in the game.

Couldn't you tell me in relative detail what problems you find with the game in its current state? And would you say the general issue overall is citadels or at least that's a major component?
---
Why not I liked them, burning life on the other hand....ick
---
No, you specifically didn't say that specific part, but it has been around this subreddit for over a year, always propagated by idiots such as yourself who make things claims about Test's victimhood. It's dumb, it's incorrect and it is tiring.
---
By the way you're even using the term seal clubbing itself incorrectly. Seal clubbing doesn't mean one side gets beat, not every loss or defeat is a seal clubbing, what's happening in the north is seal clubbing. Ncpl are not new players, calling that seal clubbing, or what happened in 2016 seal clubbing, is dumb and incorrect, so while you did not use the term backstab, I'll go and slot you in with those other morons because frankly, you're no better.
---
Hoenstly there's a few things to this post. Had the keepstars not had the ability to stock supers, alliances could only hold as many supers as they could plex alts to maintain.
---
You're forgetting what Doom actually enjoyed, combat Rorqs and Storks. I don't think he ever really got a ton of joy out of the super combat compared to playing with some of the more creative ships.
---
It's closer to 2 decades at this point. Think we've had 16 years now.

Burning life's story left a lot to be desired, but revealed at least a passing resemblance to the established setting. Someone who knew the lore wrote it.

The only thing you've done is made apparent that extreme late term abortion has its merits.

---
Glad you're still around talking sense... Atlhough since I left and decided to poke my head around Eve, it appears things have become much worse, and are progressing how I imagined. I hope this game fixes itself but honestly I don't see it happening.
---
Alright I'll give you that especially when it came to templar one the first one wasn't so bad but there where elements. As the story goes itself I really enjoyed it!

OP thinks this is the best way to save his alt’s high sec raitaru.
---
Another day, another Doug.
---
I believe they warp randomly between wormholes, maybe to citadels and planets as well. I know for sure that if they land in an anchorable bubble it will catch them permanently though, because of how their warp command works.
---
You need to have demands for people to be aligned with your cause and for the action to be effective.

I dunno, but if everything was dumped on the floor day one everyone would have mathfu'd the fuck out if it- then complained it's not enough added features.

You'll note combat rorqs, to pick an example, are only viable when the enemy can't drop dreads to rub them off the field.

&gt;Err? Is the concept of building and fielding the next best thing not opportunity cost lmfao?
---
No, no it's not.  That's called a downside, or a mitigating factor to the upside.  Opportunity cost is when the effort spent on one thing prevents you from pursuing other opportunities.  For example, it would be a legitimate criticism of my point to say that the opportunity cost of my idea (in the form of forcing CCP devs to work on removing supers so that they can't use the same time to work on some other improvement) is too high.  But what you're describing has almost nothing to do with the concept of opportunity cost.  You might consider apologizing for taking such a condescending tone about something you were clearly wrong about.
---
imagine being a furfag
---
If you are interested in headed over to B-R again, be sure to get into contact with Starcade. They're the corp that owns the system and they might be able to help you get out there for a bit.
---
I don't agree. The fact that Rorqs and increasingly supers and titans are meaningless to lose is why the former get used AFK and the latter are deployed to fight bombers. The fact that losses are meaningless is why alliances mass deploy citadels, reducing their risk to near zero and making them impossible to clear out.
---
The content that it drives is massive fleets shooting uncontested keepstars, and everyone coalescing into massive blocs in order to krab unchecked, perpetuating the cycle. 
---
Also, even if it did drive more willingness to lose ships, content is shallow and meaningless if instead of huge victories which turn the tide of wars we have FPS deathmatch-style combat where losses just delay how fast people return to the field in a new ship.
---
i dont have to imagine it i just do it tbh
---
it's maybe*
---
I pray everyday for a meteor to extinguish your alliance of degenerates furry sympathizers from the game
---
Agreed. When you watch Eve trailers you see a couple of titans, a bunch of dreads, and huge numbers of subcaps. I want to see battles like that again.
---
It’s not brochado
---
I also clearly explained in my post that I was just venting out in my comment, but if you want to be offended by something not directed at you then by all means let the butt hurt flow.
---
Unfortunately Krabs fund CCP more than pvpers.
---
He lost rorqs to provi.
---
they even have some back up devs to... stand in... if need be
---
“No, you 22 chromosomed failure” 
---
I’m not an English major, but that does seem to be specifying me. Now granted later on, you threw out some little “I fucked up” venting walkback. But hey, if your not good with standing by what you say. There is the backspace key.
---
Can I get his stuff?
---
given his twitter feed content he's into uncontested wins that take no effort and blaming CCP for his failures.
---
Not or can’t?
---
Min/maxing is boring because CCP has made it that way by skewing it so far towards krabbing and being  risk-averse. Its not the concept of min/maxing that bothers me; it's the gameplay style which it favors (and the extent to which CCP have lost the ability to reverse the damage they've caused).
---
Also, Eve isn't a single player game. The gameplay styles encouraged by game mechanics inherently affect the experience of everyone else, regardless of the style they choose to play. If you have any doubt about this; just look at Hard Knocks, Brave, the entirety of lowsec. All tried to play styles they found fun and got pushed out of it by the dominant style of the day.
---
You should checkout the runescape Subs. Hot damn
---
if it were me, id pay 10bill... but then again i would pay 100bill if anyone can wipe out costal brotherhood completely hahaha, but i doubt it would happen lol
---
I’m willing to hold on to your assets while you take a break
---
Everyone is gonna log in to see if no one logged in.
---
Should be the best and busiest day of eve in years.
---
Yes, but only when docked.
---
ok
---
If he didn’t know about warp disruptions and is flying a shuttle - I doubt those things are available to him
---
PL could do worse than finding new blood, their previous 3 outings were losing to test in provi, losing to test in the south, losing to goons in the north and they are now again losing to goons in the north only this time they aren't even putting up a resistance.
---
Must be Battlefield 4 players.
---
&gt; Please tell me how I'm salty? 
---
&gt; &gt; Wwb ended. They reset. People fought each other. Now you're calling it seal clubbing and backstabbing and whatever other dumbfuck shit people claim it to be on this subreddit.
---
&gt; &gt; always propagated by idiots such as yourself who make things claims about Test's victimhood. It's dumb, it's incorrect and it is tiring.
---
&gt; &gt; The only thing you've done is made apparent that extreme late term abortion has its merits.
---
k
---
&gt; Ignorance of what? You used terms incorrectly
---
&gt; &gt; Seal clubbing doesn't mean one side gets beat, not every loss or defeat is a seal clubbing, what's happening in the north isn't seal clubbing. Ncpl are not new players, calling that seal clubbing, or what happened in 2016 seal clubbing, is dumb and incorrect
---
Seal clubbing is a stronger entity farming a less experienced, weaker one that generally has no fighting chance whatsoever - for various reasons (newbies, low-level gear, poor game sense, vastly lower rank, etc). Brave Newbies has it in their name, Test is pretty notorious for pulling in everyone new with a pulse, Provi is renowned for having been a pushover for most of their lifetime. Note the word *farming*, because you have trouble with reading comprehension I'm going to emphasize some things for you. NCPL were farming entities with no fighting chance for the better part of a decade, and while it's taken shitty game changes and massive overblobbing to finally give them that fighting chance, now they have it and they're taking advantage.
---
I'm not on Test's side - I want them cut down to size just as much as I want NCPL done, but it's pretty silly to think that they weren't being seal clubbed - long before WWB for that matter - and that they aren't banding together to stomp out the clubbers. Get your head out of your ass and dust the salt off.
---
vet? the dude was here for 3 years
---
just stop posting
---
I vote for option C.
---
What else is there to see? (Probably need a pamphlet and a tour guide.)
---
More just a meme than an actual viable thing for sure
---
Yup, everyone is eve loves to just sit around bashing structures with titans and krabbing all day long.
---
In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost, or alternative cost, of making a particular choice is the value of the most valuable choice out of those that were not taken. In other words, opportunity that will require sacrifices.
---
also nice strawman btw.
---
Please, no one in a real null bloc actually does that, unless they want to. There are tons of small gang groups in blocs that go out and get content all the time, or big gangs, or you can easily travel the ansibel highway to get some solo action.
---
That's why null blocs grow so huge, because they are capable of catering to virtually any playstyle.
---
This is sufficient and is the smallest (cheapest) upwell structure. Which I know for a fact meets the requirements. It’s also very easy to kill and is more expensive if you actually plan to fit it/expect it to have any defensive capability at all.
---
How about instead of praying on reddit, you log in and shoot us yourself.
---
Long ago, the four powers lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Goons attacked. Only the r/eve, master of all trolling could stop them, but when the galaxy needed them most, they logged out.
---
Yes, because no one has ever forgot to fuel a pos or citadel. And no one has lost a tower before because they missed a ping it was rfd.
---
And yet you still come here?
---
At least he didn't bring his retriever or drake
---
Plus, it is not that hard to get into a ceptor
---
wait i didn't need that refit anyways :P let's not turn it on, :D:D:D. thanks for sharing, sweet vid.
---
I'm aware of the definition, please explain how it applies to your original post?  You were saying that in the absence of supers, people would build caps.  Which is obvious.  Are you saying that those two are opportunity coats of one another?  Because that's fair enough, but it's also meaningless because, once again, it's obvious.  And you certainly failed to explain that in your original post, which really made it come across like you don't know what an opportunity cost is.
---
Trial periods over.
---
And yet no one is intentionally welping supers, which is something that happens at almost every other level.  They're still too expensive.
---
As for citadels being too cheap/meaningless, I completely agree.
---
Honestly, reddit is the only reason I have ever resubbed eve. That motivation only lasted through so much actual in game time and here I sit unsubbed yet again, reading /r/eve.
---
There is an eve sights website with a bunch of things to go and look at. There's a lot more than you think
---
Again, you're using seal clubbing incorrectly. Test wasn't a 'seal,' in 2016. Making the claim that they were is dumb. Neither were Brave. Neither of them were seals back in the days of Hero either. I can safely say that since I was in another Hero alliance when the coalition was founded and can safely state that both of those alliances were well established at that time. Your may try to twist the definition to fit your idiocy, but you're using the term wrong. Obviously that doesn't fit well with you so you throw around the term 'salty,' after I pointed out you were wrong.
---
You being a member of test or not doesn't matter, as I've said before you're pushing this test victimhood shit and it's dumb. If you don't like being called dumb, stop doing dumb shit, hope that helps 
---
At this point all I can come up with is that these claims of 'salt,' must be extreme projection if you want to constantly revise history to bend it towards your fantasy. Idk where they alliances involved upset you along the way, could not care less about hearing that take, but it's ironic for you to tell me I have my head up my ass after making the claims you have here.
---
Lol like you'd even know
---
But their ticks!!!
---
It’s following up a quotation as if someone said the italiZed quotation and then I followed up with what my hypothetical response would have been to them and then ended it with the assurance that was not guided at you just a scenario I was screenplaying.
---
Why are you so desperate for me to offend you?
---
MAKE EVE FREE TO PLAY SHUT UP FOZZIE
---
Ok but DJ's a good guy and can probably do way better with it. Ragequitting was inevitable for such a polarizing figure.
---
are you a bot or just stupid?
---
I don't like armor but I like amarr ships look.
---
If he can't hack playing a sandbox game, it's not really the games fault.
---
I've been thinking about making a post about this actually, but I've figured it'd be perceived as self important or attention seeking when the intent is really the opposite. Anyway thisll be a ramble. 
---
Anyway, when I read your comment I'm thinking about how incredible it is that there are so many names and events and stories that **you guys made**, they are stories **about you**, that people like me know (and I feel like there have to be more like me) -- and I've legit never even played EVE. 
---
Like, I bet there are a lot of people who hang out here (and maybe some coalition forums, maybe discord servers, definitely blogs and youtube videos and twitch, and definitely not the damn official forums lol) who have hears of the rorqual nerfs, know who pandemic legion and gsf and test and brave and rangers regiment and gotg and on and on and on -- all just second hand from social media. Because you guys have been able to participate in a story telling unlike any other, and in a world of infinite content, the Living Story of EVE is really unlike any other.
---
Idk man it's crazy. And obviously the big names get to be known more, to your original point. It sucks to see names dropping. I'm still mourning the loss of GigX tbh, the war and subsequent end of CO2 was like a golden era for spectators. 
---
TL;DR Doomchinchilla will be remembered by a shit ton of people who have never even played EVE is what I'm gettin at I guess, along with a lot more of you, and a ton of stories. 
---
I mean........ ook ook
---
and you are part of the problem
---
I don't know. Let's ask /u/rageliner what he thinks of your valuable suggestions about what PL should do.
---
The game will go on. There are many pyschotics still left to play eve.
---
makes a lot more sense for them to run when tits clear they cant wing then try to stay and fight. like other invasion command ship's
---
Would it make you feel better if the Imperium moved the supercap umbrella in a cycle around four regions (*), with the jump-drive-equipped rorquals following them ?
---
Because that's the sole effect of your changes result in.
---
(*) Delve, Querious, Period Basis and Fountain.
---
casper has me logging in again tho
---
He finally did, after all this time, hear about the.......
---
I'll miss ya, bud.
---
you graduated, nice!
---
The thread isn't supposed to go up anymore + hasn't been updated in forever. Automod scheduler stopped listening to me long ago so I've been manually removing, stickying and sorting these for the last year or so. Been a bit busy irl so missed this one for a bit :(
---
But did he resign from Twitter?
---
To me, this thread is much more like a bunch of people blaming each other for the relative positions of the deck chairs on the Titanic.
---
Hopefully do a Skill U.
---
What you really said: Just because he is quitting because he isn't on the winning side anyone doesn't make him a little bitch.
---
&gt; there's just nothing that can be done
---
If you admit defeat, you lose
---
That he really enjoyed being on the side that could helicopter dick and oppress people but not the receiving end?
---
The mistake was putting hedliner in charge...
---
Mouthpiece or cod piece for Hedliner?
---
No no, he put a goon tag on his name. He must totally know.
---
We didn't deserve Cymek
---
So goons are winning so hard there is a logout protest...lawl
---
This just sounds like wh fights but its all pre-set up. It's an interesting idea but its the same type of content if you were living in wh's.
---
That is exactly what I keep saying. You are set, my opinion has no value to you. What truly boggles the mind is why you keep asking for something you don't want.
---
Sounds similar to the idea of that failed free-port market hub thing, which failed catastrophically if I recall.
---
It's an interesting idea, but all it takes is one group being dicks about things to kill your dream.
---
This is basic internet 101, you should not go to community outlets expecting an accurate representation of the community surrounding a thing. 
---
Every single internet community EVER has this problem its not unique to eve and you are a bit naive if you thought so.
---
It doesn't have to be 24 hours, just an hour.
---
Most players wont commit to 24, but they will accept 1.
---
Literally nothing. Just conjecture and correlation with no evidence.
---
That's just like.....you opinion man........
---
Don't forget the wreck of Steve
---
It’s 30+ days dedicated.  When you’re new that’s an eternity
---
So... (((doomchinchilla)))???
---
Yet here you are.  Still.
---
Does anyone have some marshmallows for this bonfire!?!?!?!?!
---
Because a thread about my good friend doom was made and I decided to comment
---
Can’t convince people of this or &lt;gasps&gt; encourage them to make the content they want in the FUCKING SANDBOX MMO...
---
Always someone else’s (primarily ccp) fault
---
Good riddance - I can respect panfam as an enemy, but after the BS he pulled on naming that GE- astrahus, and his toxic attitude inside and out of game, I'm glad to see him gone.
---
I’m not quite sure what you’re getting at here friend
---
what is being protested?
---
That he’s not having fun anymore.  Shocker.  Free will is a thing.
---
For just you?
---
\~1.6Mn
---
If you actually want a proper corp you're going to try to attract members to?
---
\~5-8Bn to start.
---
Wormholes with extra steps
---
Lmao wat
---
Ok little bee with all the facts lmao
---
Technically inclined would be better. The back end of the many organizations in this game is pretty impressive.
---
Yeah but aren’t interceptors immune to all forms of aoe tackle, only points and scrams can tackle them I thought??
---
i was a part of those riots, we wanted to make things clear that RTM as laid out in their internal documents was not ok and that we wanted real confirmation they heard what we are saying.  imo the RTM came out anyway in the forum of skill injectors but idk, arguments to be made there i guess.
---
this time however i have no fucking clue what we are talking about. i know things need work but i dont know what 'things' we are trying to address here... your post lists nothing to give direction, just 'dont log in'...  thats a terrible way to start a protest.
---
The problem with setting things up honorably is that it only takes one person being dishonorable to ruin it.
---
Weird, according to evewho it's 11 years. Propably fakenews
---
Care to explain the dozens of other posts then?
---
And what about your group? FED-UP
---
because i feel like it?
---
I tried to give you award and found I have to pay :)
---
Anyway, thx for answer!
---
thinking emoji
---
So this is what every Eve thread boils down to...
---
&gt;Losing to test in provi 
---
Wut, fighting down south with just dreads and subcap fleets while tapi brought supers..... *then* PL brings supers and tapi ~~cries for~~ batphones goons because legacy coalition can’t stand on their own 2 feet
---
Goons were my first choice, but like the name says, I got kicked because somehow I was banned on the forums, even though I was a former goon who left amicably due to RL and I passed the vetting process of one of the most prestigious goon corps.
---
Gold for you!
---
That puts any new group even further behind in trying to catch up to the existing large blocs.
---
To make this work, could CCP increase build costs for new titans/supers  AND add a one time hull cost adjustment isk tax for all existing titan/super owners before they can undock again?  No idea how it would be implemented, but that would make all titans/supers more costly, not just the new ones.
---
The current formula is:  
---
Effectiveness = 0.5\^( -(4.6341e-25)**n**^4 + (4.6799e-17)**n**^3 - (4.5806e-11)**n**^2 + (1.8663e-05)**n** )  
---
Where **n** is the combined amount repaired by other remote repairs targeting the ship last time they repaired.  
---
I couldn't find the formula eve uses so I modeled a close approximation based off the pictures in the dev blog.  
---
If I recall correctly it's always within 1% of the graphs they used and typically much closer.  
---
If you have any ideas I'm also open to improving it.
---
You misunderstood his comment. It was in reply to the suggestion to use fleet ceptor, cloaking nullified T3C, or Luxury Yacht, which are all immune to warp bubbles. Suggestion was to use inertia stabs for instant-align so that insta-locking gatecamp alpha-strike ships don't 1-ball him.
---
Tbh I can't think of one thing I enjoy in the game right now. I used to enjoy roaming in a group of 5 or 6 and having skirmishes with the locals. Now most of the people you run in to are bots or they light a cyno and drop 500 supers and haw dreads.   Used to be that if you couldn't find anyone to fight you could just head to a entry system, there were always people camping there to mess with, but since nullification no one bothers. The game is so full of players yet so lifeless that it makes me sad just roaming null sec.
---
dooms a cunt that used to spoil got through wardecs
---
Hey man I'm just trying to make sure this guy's deep insights on why a 2000 man alliance was mysteriously unable to defeat the largest and second largest coalitions in the game make it to the people who need to see them
---
Does Shadoo still play the game?
---
Changing it while it's paused might not be too bad.  
---
I'll look into it and add it if it doesn't break too much stuff.  
---
I'd considered having the AI swap off targets they can't break but this seems more useful and slightly easier.  
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Depends on the fitting, looking quickly at my AB scimi and my loki fit with links the loki has 33k extra EHP, reps 30 ehp/s less flat out but after 9 cycles (there's an ancil remote rep on the scimi) reps more and is more cap stable. It also locks one less target and has less scanres. It also costs about 3 1/4th as much as the scimi. We use them in loki fleets because they save on links ships and don't stand out as much as a scimi would in addition to the ability to refit covert nulli and leave basically at will.
---
You cant do that. Thatd be like you buying a car. Driving that car for years, then a dealer coming up, taking your keys and saying this car got 3k more expensive. Pay up
---
 Not saying i have any thing to offer, but im sure some one out there mite have some good idea's maybe you should give them some off your valuable insights ?
---
DAAAAMN!!!!!
---
I don’t know how helpful this will be in resolving but here goes:
---
This has now happened three times. Last night I reinstalled windows again (2nd time) and everything worked fine til this evening. 
---
So to answer your questions best I can:
---
1. ISP: Verizon FIOS
---
2. Close to wireless router, excellent signal strength. Router is Actiontec MI424WR.
---
3. Can’t access the megapath site. Shows in google search results.
---
4. Also can’t access wireless drivers to re-install.
---
I am trying just resetting network settings but I am not confident that will work. Also, I tried connecting thru my iphone’s hotspot but still had the same issue.
---
No.
---
I love homeworld and the remastered versions. But no, it can not compete with eve graphics.
---
Is that the after story to when they were the largest entity for a decade and blobbed and helicopter titan dicked everyone?
---
I agree..I have been in BNI for years now..the best times were when we were surrounded by orange fighting doom and friends daily.
---
&gt;PL
---
&gt;Largest entity for a decade
---
Come on man. At least try to make it believable.
---
Hi Hilmar
---
You realise this is what every decent c5 corp does as is?
---
Eve graphics for their newest models are AAA level as far as I'm concerned, so it's definitely not that.
---
The first time I played HW was such a trip thought. Those black and white cinematics were so damn unique.
---
Loot?
---
Irrelevant enough to have people gossiping about him.
---
There’s literally dozens of us
---
A yacht requires no skills and can even fit an offline covert cloak to allow newbros to take a blops bridge
---
this is really gonna hurt by end of 2020 when we're doing drunk suicide titan xmas roams
---
i prefer the term budget warlord but also yes, satisfactory just released nuclear power and mk3 miners!!!!!11
---
\-losting to test in provi  
---
Tapi brought legacy supercal fleet to fight dreads and subs  
---
\- Losing to test in the south  
---
PL brought down supercaps to combat tapi's supercaps, Tapi blued goons (and everyone went on about how pl were the bad guys)  
---
\- losing to goons in the north  
---
Yup, Although ncpl lost trillions to try and save gotg
---
\- loosing again
---
Gotg decided to go with goons to hit ncpl because they secretly signed deals months prior 
---
Looking forward to goons having to burn from 1dq to save gotg after this war
---
I agree, Eve is not just a MMO it's a Space Opera! I don't ever want to miss an episode.
---
God damn. They took that out ?!
---
I really need to re-install to check on my assets...
---
did you use the wrong account for this post?
---
And a few Titans surrounding and bumping it
---
It's 2019 this could happen
---
Using multiple accounts is not at all necessary for a new player. It's mostly something more experienced players do. I'd say to keep everything to your main account at first- mining has near zero fun value, and you may soon consider PvE much better of a use of your time. There are many PVE pathways that make much more than mining, even than rorqurals- abyssal sites, for example, consistently net a billion isk an hour if you know how to do it right. In your position, I would only make an alt if you prefer AFK sources of income (like mining.)
---
Remember no din...  doomchinchillas.
---
Boosters used to be illegal, but they are now legalized. There isn't as much of a illegal vibe, but you certainly could make a profit if you know what you're doing.
---
No you always drop as many caps as possible to eventually get the eviction escalation.
---
&gt; Are you being a cunt because you think he was being a cunt?
---
&gt; Are you being a cunt because you feel personally attacked by his criticism?
---
&gt; Are you being a cunt because you are just a cunt normally? 
---
yes
---
I know, but, the idea was for smaller groups to face off against larger groups on an "even playing field"
---
I hate to be the one to break this to you, but the existence of furries isn't the reason you're not getting laid.
---
Yeah unfortunately
---
Never heard of that before
---
I mean, it's can also be used by people other than wormholers who want an honor brawls with fairish odds
---
Can we have a stickied thread entitled. Nerds you probably don't care about are quitting. Would save us reading these drawn out, ccp do something posts and game is stale posts. Sure the info would still be there.. but I'd know where it is and avoid it.
---
Literally no one comes to Reddit to read this self indulgent bleeting that occurs daily.
---
Anyway, cheers Doom bye.
---
Redshifted away, like it entered a black hole.
---
No, but cymek kind of set the dino art style for the forseeable future, may he rest in pepperoni.
---
Munins are fotm?  Sweet.
---
Triple boxing T1 is definitely wayyyyy worse in income than doing one T5
---
Imagine being a goon and actually believing this
---
I haven't played in 6 months but I still get the urge...
---
There's nothing like it.
---
You'll spend a few Titan's worth of money in Magic real fast if you start a physical collection.
---
Gf. Looks like a real kitchen sink fleet that got you down. Haha
---
Does you laptop have a switch or button for wireless/airplane mode? It might be one of your function/F1-12 keys.
---
Comparing Hedliners insight to /r/eve's is like comparing a drunken mules insight to /r/eve's.  Neither is very good at it, but one at least plays eve online.
---
did anybody even answer your question? lol
---
I think he said world war bee lmao
---
as much as casino war is more according, world war bee is by far a better war name
---
Sounds like content for Eve North
---
Well, they've done nothing but whine since they lost the supercap crown.

Do you have a discord? Message me at

Yes.  Except just about any mouthbreather can be in our eve killer club.
---
imagine actually having a smooth enough brain to think that your enemies quitting the game is good for your long-term enjoyment of the game
---
They do tho
---
People have forgotten what true free-range content even looks like. If it isn't on a spoon they don't even recognize it.
---
*I was there!*
---
Imagine N3 with 10 regions filled with Keepstars. Also imagine B-R5RB had a staging Keepstar in it instead of a station tied to sovereignty. Where would we be today? Also at that time the CFC was roughly equivalent in power to N3, there was (only one, but still) a sizeable counter-weight to their strength. And their "Impenetrable Fortress" was built with supercapitals, not 1000+ structures with 3 reinforcement timers all within 1 mid of their entire supercapital force for any defensive timer *on top* of their massive supercapital force
---
You sure? I thought they weren't allowed to...
---
yeah I'm never a fan of arrogant pricks, but as long as it doesn't leave the game they're just another exciting rival. he went out of bounds with that one lmao
---
Not really.  I still have no idea what’s happening.
---
Yeah man, dropping Rorqs with points then PANICing. Very fair gameplay, great stuff.
---
that he is a whiney cunt and leaves game as soon as he's not on the winning side
---
Nobody's going to do that, though. Everyone is too butthurt and too scared to lose anything so they'll just escalate a bunch of stuff and flood the grid so their precious killboard doesn't get red.
---
Considering how well this plays into his hand i'm not sure that you aren't him 🤔
---
The real isk is in the loot and salvage
---
Mark726 has his [EVE Travel](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/) blog where you can see all the beautiful and significant locations of New Eden.
---
cry more
---
they're allowed to, but don't, because they resent the players of the game
---
i remember when he got deep dicked in nenna by galmil and dhsj and his lowsec slow cat fleet got bummed.
---
he then ran to PL im sure he still has ptsd from this now
---
 
---
Tapi brought legacy supercap fleet to fight PL dreads and subs
---
\- Losing to test in the south - didn't  commit got fucked over
---
PL brought down supercaps to combat tapi's supercaps, Tapi blued goons (and everyone went on about how pl were the bad guys) - PL brought the whole East side of the map goons dicided to get involved
---
\- losing to goons in the north
---
Yup, Although ncpl lost trillions to try and save gotg - died in a fire any which way you look at it.
---
amazing what happens when one side has more and the other less, Gotg decided to go with goons to hit ncpl because they secretly signed deals months prior -  NC sat on the fence and watch PH hit their space and decided to wait and see who won before choosing a side.
---
Looking forward to goons having to burn from 1dq to save gotg after this war - why would we do that?
---
literally just pl with no supers versus co2, tikle, brave, catch tapi pets, fcon: "okay we can do this but we have to pick our fights pretty carefully"
---
tapi: "that won't do, we can't have people interrupting our bluing and rorqing" *moves supers in range* "haha sucks to suck lmao loser pl"
---
pl: "okay i guess we're done messing around in curse, but it looks like waffles are finding some neat content in provi" *shifts to assah*
---
pl and waffles, still no supers, against provi: actually a pretty even fight, months of *really* good subcap brawls, and occasional dread shootouts with co2 and tapi joining the fray on provi's side, and ncdot joining on pl's side
---
tapi: "our friends are losing fights, light the fucking beacons" *moves supers in range* "haha sucks to suck lmao loser pl"
---
pl: "well that's unfortunate but i guess we'll just take our ball and go home for a bit."
---
~several months later~
---
pl: *moves supers into range*
---
tapi: *shocked pikachu face*
---
Lol who lets you post over there.
---
Only looting the bio is a big loss, especially considering the value of the mats compared to everything else.  I dunno how hard it is to loot all the boxes but it may even be a better idea to run 4s and loot the boxes than 5s and skip.
---
So we're at what, a month now of useless content in this "Expansion".  Why not release it when its ready?  Guess CCP is trying to mimic Bethesda/EA/Activision, it is 2019 after all.
---
Are you HIGH? PL supers and titans were the first ones on field, I was there I watched you jump in first, don't blame us for being willing and ready to escalate you scrub tier wanna be tough guy.
---
Get all the way to B-R 2 see what?a wreck and beacon???
---
They're allowed to but their before ccp employment character gets nuked and replaced with a new one of equivalent SP and they're not allowed to tell people who they are / that they're employed with CCP.
---
There was one in my old corp who did an oopsie and we found out.
---
Yeah, pretty much
---
Not what i meant but good catch
---
in ge- they blueball if you dont come as a brawly solo pvper
---
Well..GOTG brokered a peace treaty with goons for 6 months of peace for the north. Gobbins didn't like that so he tried to take Branch from them with the help of Elo (Black Legion). They underestimated GOTG and couldn't even take a single system.While all of this was going on NC. reset standing with GOTG and their renters making it pretty  obvious which side they were on. PL was taking out fleet roaming Deklein on a regular.
---
Fast forward 6 months later and Goons are burning the North(Panfam space). NC./PL/PH expect GOTG to help them defend. Sort tells to them to get fucked and instead takes Tenal from them.All structures owned by Rate my Ticks (NC. renter corp) handed to Sort for the lolz. This pisses off Lady Scarlet even more.  
---
So now Panfam is crying foul @ GOTG when they themselves are ones to blame for the North being  as disbanded as it is.
---
So that's why he was salty that SkillU virgins disbanded. Doom didn't get all the attention he was waiting. His quitting feels quite insignificant compared. 
---
🖐️
---
wow a goonswarm poster with an reasonable assessment of the problem? are you flairbaiting?
---
he didn't say it, was a sidebar conversation
---
yeah its about 1/3-1/4th that of running T5s.
---
oh look, the game is dying, like it has been for the last 15 years.
---
"Don't worry guys, its just stage 1!  CCP has something awesome planned!"
---
CCPLS add logi to killmails :(
---
The extra time it would have taken per room to get those other cans would have probably increased my total run time by 25%, so I basically banked on the idea that the extraction nodes would increase my payout by less than 25%. Also means I have less to do when it comes to comparing to the other tiers.

A dozen mobile games, about 5 FPS/battle royales that won't ever see the light of day, and digging random things out of Hilmar's ass, since he can't seem to stop getting things stuck in there.

You can keep people from using warp disruptors using warp core stabilisers!
---
The legendary doomchimpchilla, with all the charisma of a damp paper towel. May his reign be long remembered.

What's the fit you use for T5 fleet sites?
---
We already had piggles gone, he claimed to be quitting and killed S2N.
---
&gt; Looking forward to goons having to burn from 1dq to save gotg after this war  
---
  
---
I was actually hoping that after this war, goons and PL join hands to burn Branch to the ground.
---
Typical krab you can’t even empathize with anyone but yourself 🙄
---
Theres also a brawling cerb on there. I mean i would never use a 10mn ab ham cerb but i dont see how that belongs on there.
---
At last worst name ever...
---
New world order v2 
---
This time united against the branch botting menace
---
Nah, meant the goon propaganda got so far into my brain that i tend to ignore people using the wrong name. My "lmao wat" was in regard to the inaccurate description of Doom. I'm not a fan of the dude by any means but hes been actually trying to do stuff till way after WWB.
---
??? Down in Curse + Provi, PL didnt bring supers/titans ???
---
no thed were cut.
---
uh

Please don't. A mass logout with no demands is worse than doing nothing.

if you like exploring eve, [katia sae's journey] may be of particular interest to you

but this does not save you from the inevitable bubble
---
I liked watching this a lot! I'll try to catch your stream next time you're online!
---
when you stop playing eve because everyone is mean to you on reddit can i have your stuff?
---
Stront all the things!
---
&gt; Giving the little guy some ability to inflict actual damage would be positive. 
---
and as i have pointed out several times - a repair cost isn't this as it's just an ability for large entities to bankrupt smaller entities while remaining pretty much unaffected.
---
I legitimately miss the toasted duck, though the new model for the Moa is pretty nice as well. Frankly, I miss most of the old asymmetric models that have changed even where the new ones are legitimately better, simply because most of them were interesting to look at.
---
I don't know when you're thinking of that had 60-person fleets. I remember days of 20-30 person fleets, but those days are... last week? Instead of trying to set up a C3 wormhole to have thunderdomes in, why not just set up a C5 corp and take honor brawls?
---
Am I missing some 5D chess drone setup? Why Fed navy gardes over max dps Gecko setup considering your target.
---
Otherwise nice vid, nice no fear tanking.
---
they are allowed to play just not in leadership positions since the t2 sabre bpo incident
---
They're allowed to. Just not openly. Or in major leadership positions. And IA keeps an eye on them.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

I will have to get a cable. Meantime yes it has airport function but this issue is not NO internet access.  It’s limited internet access.
---
Maybe because not everyone is upset. Panfam mobilized entire Eve against us and ejected us from our space.
---
We did not say the game was broken. We started working to get stronger so we could have our revenge.
---
Panfam however got lazy and burnt a lot of bridges.
---
Now they have no friends, are on the receiving side and suddenly the game is broken?
---
Nahhhhhhh game is only not broken When PL/NC are winning.
---
Those dudes only enjoy the game When they are winning. 
---
Tldr: whiners.
---
You're pretty spot on.  THis is what is happening.  I know Frat has their eyes on this area also.  But I think Darkness and Wombat are trying to push first
---
Those price difference make no sense about 3 means either 300 million or 3 billion for the loki 300 million barely gets you the hull and subsystems so unlikely alternatively you mean 3 billion but then you follow up of 1/4th makes no sense ( it doesn't either way really ). 
---
as well that gives you a 12 billion isk scimi or a 1.2 billion isk scimi both seem way over the normal price for such a ship in a doctrine. 
---
What I suspect you're getting at is that the scimi is 1/4th the cost of a 3 billion isk loki, that puts it at like 700ish and that seems reasonable yeah.
---
Why not both?
---
All indications I've seen are that it's doing well, with 35%+ adoption. Eve does enough of the right kind of math to benefit from the 64 bit change. And yes, at times we have been bumping into the memory limit.
---
How do I change clones (jump out of and into a mindlink for example) in the same station without incurring a jump timer?
---
Wait co2 is dead what did I miss the last three years
---
I Love this.
---
And I love you, fellow stranger

everyone became miners and allied with goons. co2 had no place in that world.

Oh!   yeah I def see what you mean now
---
back when living in lowsec

you have no idea how fucking amazing it was to be able to repair your capital guns without paying 200m for NPC station services after doing a dread brawl over an r64

Again, guy in a shuttle, doesn't have a super and doesn't view a shuttle as "two ticks lel"

jesus its just game of thrones spoilers. read the books if you dont want citadel spoilers.
---
I guess doomchimp wants some if that attention too
---
This is true.
---
Actually I have had that experience.
---
I’ll say the warp stabber is a good first start.
---
&gt; why would we do that?
---
same reason you protect your crabs. so mittens can RMT his ass off.
---
ps: learn to format ffs. double space at the end of a line give line breaks.
---
yup
---
Wasn’t the big event called ‘Titanomachy’?
---
A venture with warp core stabilizers is a cheap option if you give it another shot.
---
Gigx made Rl threats during a livestream of the chat because the judge stole and flipped nearly all assets of value from co2, ccp banhammered his ass, Co2 failscated, Gigx tried to join the game on alts and regorm Co2, between the weakened state of Co2, goons hammering Co2 as revenge for the casino war and Gigx alts constantly getting banned the alliance died a slow and painfull death untill Gigx finally threw the towel in the ring. A sad ending.
---
Hold in mind i was in no way involved in this nither as ally or foe of co2 so maby some of my info is off i just recite what i can somewhat remember.
---
Wasn't the judge on CSM?
---
I haven’t played as long as some, what was the t2 Sabre bpo incident?
---
If i were to keep a stockpile of backup rolling megas i would not higgs them until they were actually needed for rolling.
---
nah that arc will just pop out in low and 2.8seconds later 182789 supers, titans and dreads (no fax) will land and alpha it
---
yep, it'll be the boson gatecamp that gets him ;)
---
It's 2019 dude, you know we all have 5+ accounts these days....
---
Ops 😂
---
then give it fuck-off flak aswell, like what citadels have
---
ah i see, thanks for clarifying
---
So is there like an inverse square thing going on for area of effect for the CME? Like, will firing an erebus' doomsday just eradicate all life in a galaxy?
---
&gt; As someone who was there, I can say it was pretty fun even if the payout was next to nothing.
---
wait so its dead already?
---
At some point year, after the incident atleast, i am unsure if he was before.
---
Not since late 2014/early 2015
---
Isn't 10^60 more years than the universe is expected to last before heat death
---
What do you mean "shrink" ?
---
And that's just from a laser. Check out the dude's post about the aurora ominae accelerating just one ton of antimatter. It basically EMPs galaxies.
---
Shrinking the whole economy won't do anything because the problem is mismatched manpower. Some groups have much more manpower than others so if the whole economy was smaller the same problem would still develop.
---
What you need to figure out is how to add diminishing returns to adding manpower to projects like titans without stepping on the little guy at the same time.
---
If the thing could delete numerous titans in an instant, people proably won't use them to fight it. Or would you risk several hundred billion ISK just because "hey, he might not shoot"? And if people won't fight it, they can just simply ignore it. The thing is, the invasion is still in empire space, and we don't know if, when and how it will carry over to null. If the trigs actually started removing structures, I can see CCP trying to keep it out of null as long as possible, so as to not seem like they are favoring anyone.
---
to be fair i resent most players in the game too
---
He was -- It was after a CSM Summit, in an Icelandic bar, that Aryth flipped him.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Before invention was a thing T2 items were seeded by distributed by a lottery to give out BPOs. Someone who worked for CCP rigged the lottery to ensure his alliance won a number of the most valuable ones.
---
This is a great candidate for that meme of the guy sweating over two buttons to press.
---
One says "gotg are garbage and irrelevant" the other says "gotg game killing blue donuters"
---
Pick your narrative already...
---
In Abyss, you go to content.
---
In Highsec, Abyss comes to *you*.
---
With Sort - nothing really. Botting SJW drama he generates lately isn't that spicy or even interesting.
---
But I agree in general.
---
Oh wow :O
---
Probably not. Magnetic fields can only handle so much. A CME would cause maxx extinction on earth, and a dude further up calculated that an erebus doomsday firing generates 40 billion times that much energy every second.
---
This vid should be part of "how to have fun in Eve" tutorial. Also maybe "how to not be a crybaby on Eve".
---
Very enjoyable video, good fight!
---
Did Brisc Rubins resign from CSM?
---
Wombat joined gotg and joined the fight against PanFam
---
if you want to just run from danger, which as a newbie looking to tourist is not a bad idea.
---
warp disruptors
---
- fit all your low slots with warp core stabilisers. these let you ignore half a warp disruptor for each stab. a punisher with 5x warp core stabs can escape from two disruptors.
---
in nullsec there are also bubbles which prevent warping in a 30km(?) sphere. either fixed in space as traps or ships like the sabre which can deploy such bubbles in combat.
---
- to escape these you need to be faster at flying out of them (or back to the gate) than the enemy is at killing you, so fit 5mn MWD on your frigate hull.
---
you can also avoid the fixed bubble traps by not flying in a obvious approach direction to the gate. dont fly direct gate to gate, fly to a moon or other celestial first, so you approach the gate from an odd direction. 
---
eventually in null space you fly often you will make gate perch bookmarks a few 100 km above or below each gate so you can more easily avoid bubble camps. and even deeper gate perches at 50k km from each gate so you can d-scan from a safe distance to asses the danger on the gate.
---
For a game like eve I don't think it will do much. Since it will cut both ways. Make the T2 to OP and it will become the new meta. Look at what happened with the Machariel. It was a pirate ship  that became the new meta and lost its spot when they tinkered with the mods . I'm slowly seeing people feelding entire triglavian fleets. So it is slowly creeping on becoming the new meta. Also we kinda got pirate caps. But they are super expensive. Make it too expensive for its purpose and it won't become meta. Make it too cheap and it will become the new meta. It is the same with titans. They are too cheap so they become the new meta while they used to be an alliance asset if you had one
---
Don't cry!
---

Bots bounce safes in Low Sec if you probe them down.
---
They do in low sec.
---
Certain people from the Goonswarm Federation do.
---
Yes, I'm asking can it be done at a fast enough rate to offset the raw resources being gathered elsewhere that could possibly make those modules.
---
Tell me where your gangs and solo players get their content real quick? Because it sure as dick isn't Delve. Last time I checked, you regularly haul your asses up to us in the "loser north", because Geminate is the only region where you get a real fight.
---
Can you get Rackner, Kusion and the Painter freighter gankers to all stay logged out, that is 3 players and 80 characters, then your riots would have worked.
---
do people like your posting: no
---
&gt;Since I quit 2 years ago
---
I have data on 22 runs of T4 Exotics if ppl are interested
---
the main one being the sabre BPO
---
I don't remember it, but it sounds awesome
---
Linux 32-bit client (because I haven't played when 64-bit become available). However, I don't run EVE through Steam, Lutris or Wine per se. I found some little download prepared by one of the devs on the forums, it installed EVE and is best installation of it that I have run on 'nix.
---
The problem with this is that it makes the meta increasingly expensive and increasingly harder to get into for new pilots. In EVE there is no level scaling, no sorting PvP by experience tier, and certainly no waiting until you're ready for PvP, unlike in other MMOs. Where in other games players with the best ships only compete against other players with the best ships in EVE players with the best ships can at any time go fight people that are not in the best ships, which leads to one-sided engagements.
---
This idea will, if implemented, make it harder for new players to get into EVE and enjoy the best content the game has to offer. It's a hard sell telling someone who's just joined that they'll have to wait several weeks and grind through endless PvE and fiddly passive income mechanics just to be able to be on par with everyone else, especially when other MMOs offer structures whereby you can be on par with other players in PvP from day 1.
---
You do realize in the last 4 years CCP's revenue has QUADRUPLED due to skill injectors and other changes? As an investor, I would 100% invest in CCP if I didn't know about Eve.
---
Didn’t BoB also get a few super BPOs?
---
People should make sure their machines are clean and check their thermals. Loads of us lost graphics cards with the first WiS attempt was made.
---
Bro, as much as I considered the game to be broken in the age of PL power projection, the game is in a much worse condition today die to poor design choices on CCP’s end
---
erm... The graph in the dev blog scales like 1/n for the additional reps and like log(n) for big n. (I extracted the graph from the picture and plotted in logarithmically. Then you can see such things easily.) An expansion around small n (what you basically did) is good if it's a small fight. If we play around with 100 FAXs it will be a good bit off though.
---
Thank you for the answer.

Based on anecdotal ev, what do you think is your average isk/hour on t5s accounting for filament cost? 700-800mil ish? Obviously depends on Rng as well...
---
They both have the same exact result.
---
&gt; So you want even less injection? Even better. How far would you like to go? Complete removal?
---
I was simply countering your suggestion with how it doesn't really solve the problem you think exists. I am not convinced injectors are a problem.
---
Yes.  
---
  * A sig radius rebalance so that titans and dreads are much less effective against subcaps.  This includes deleting haw guns.
---
  * Increase the MWD cooldown on fighters to 3-5 minutes.  Subcaps should be able to outmaneuver a fighter blob, plus there are other answers to fighters, especially if they can't move as fast.
---
  * Delete the weird super weapons such as the bubble.  Also remove most of the weird titan shit like the GTFO module.
---
It's effective super and titan nerfs without removing them from the game.  They're still super weapons that have to be dealt with, and they're still very useful.  You just have *options* using subcap superiority.
---
Hi Reddit!
---
Quite a few of us play fairly regularly and fairly hardcore, we just stay away from positions of influence or high profile because it would result in us being outed.
---
Playing anonymously and not revealing your identity is mandatory, but in all honesty given the way EVE players behave, it's for the best.
---
I tried to play outed once, and it lasted about four hours due to constant evemail spam and suicide ganking for no other reason that the players in question knew there was a dev behind the keyboard.
---
The reason we don't play openly is because it would affect the sandbox and we'd get harassed well beyond the realms of what's considered acceptable targeting of an individual in EVE.
---
If we played openly, we wouldn't get the experience of "playing" the game as a player.
---
Actually yes I have a good friend who was part of PL about 2 years ago and he was kicked for losing an Archon on a memorial roam.
---
Well, we are complaining right now that not enough features were added. The entire invasion up to this point has been extremely anticlimactic. Remember all the hype before release? People were ecstatic when the size of the ark was figured out. CCP built them up as this giant threat. And then **bam**, glorified incursion.
---
Very rough numbers here.
---
A Rorqual mines 100m an hour, so 20 pilots mine 2b an hour.
---
That's a Dread an hour, a super every 10 hours and a titan every 30 hours.
---
Yeah, they aren't being blown up anywhere near fast enough. Death to all Supercaps.
---
Answering that question
---
I think all capitals should be T2, rather than adding T2 variants. This means that capital proliferation will slow down dramatically, with the bottleneck being the amount of moon goo that can be mined, which solves the infinite anom problem
---
If you want to get listened too un-sub your accounts and state your reason for doing so the only way companies will listen to you is if you hit them in the wallet.
---
Seeing as T1 ships are generally slightly more expensive than the mineral cost to build them, let’s say 10%, you could look at the MER for each month, add 10% to the minerals mined, and you’d get a rough estimate as to how much shit needs to be blown up per month
---
Some test folk came to lowsec today and helped us kill some Snuff:)
---
lol this is worst than my attempt
---
It is if your only reason for disliking a person is because mittens told you too
---
Steve Jobs was in Iceland to talk to the group about mac support.
---
I’ve called CCP HQ and they told me they’ll pick it up in the next pass.
---
As with anything economic I imagine it’s not 1 thing, it would be a combination of factors. If I was given control removing ISK would be a big part of what I’d have on my list.
---
Adding powercreep would just be the bullet to the back of the head that CCP have been seeming to want to give to their game. The defining difference between EVE and most other MMOs is, that EVE is a pvp focused sandbox, rather than a pve focused themepark. There is no real goal here. Some people have been playing for a decade and never even thought about getting a capital, while some 8 months old rookie is probably up to his fourth carrier alt. Just adding new and ever more powerful ships doesn't provide "goals" to work towards, but rather an increased floor to acceptable effectiveness.
---
Remember to fit those rigs!
---
Were you born retarded or did you just work really hard at it?

while it's sad to see people like Doom go, I sure as hell won't miss endgame spoilers and his smug posting in general.
---
Also, once you have the rorq at your desired skill level, you can turn your other characters on that account into PI/Reaction/Industry/Invention alts. And when you are done with that, you can start using the account as a skill farm. I think between three PI characters (the rorq can do it too), and extracting you can make your plex back and even get an okay profit.
---
I bet you're a millennial aren't you? You have tha same "everyone who disagrees with me is Hitler" attitude held by sjw millenials.
---
The first thing to clear up is that when most older eve players talk about alts they actually mean a character on another paid or plexed account. That means they can run multiple characters at the same time. One char can mine while the other is out fighting, or when char can fly ahead of the other to scout. No one would suggest splitting training between char slots early in unless you are going for very short scale goals such as PI or trade skills. 
---
Personally I would push your main to train combat skills as pve isk will easily sustain a pvp career for your initial six months of eve, (tech 1 ships are cheap, as are the first tech 2 ships you will access, inties and assault frigs).
---
You only need one account to enjoy eve and be efficient however.
---
If you decide you are in for the long run then investigating additional accounts is the normal thing to do: Training a mining char on a second account is quick once you understand the skill system and are able to train only exactly the skills you need. In a couple of months you could probably have that second account trained to give you a pilot in a mining barge and all three char slots capable of running planetary interaction. 
---
To give you an idea of the kind of end game that a two account null sec alliance player might be aiming for:
---
Account 1: 
---
PVP  subcap pilot (the main), 
---
An almost unskilled trader who sits in jita and only logs on to do shopping/selling and arrange courier contracts to ship things to the other chars
---
An Alt with about three weeks training that can run PI / reactions for passive income and also light a cyno (because someone always needs a cyno lit) (and only logs in every four days to deal with the PI stuff)
---
Account 2:
---
Mining pilot / or krabbing pve pilot / (there is probably 1 to 3 months training invested on this char)
---
Capital ship pilot (in training or trained)
---
Another utility alt doing PI or reactions or similar etc. 
---
If you are interested in starting multiple char slots then look at the “packs” sold by green man gaming . They offer one which includes three months omega and a couple of multiple char training certs which would enable you to have all char slots training at the same time. 
---
Just be very careful, it’s very easy to sink a months training into building an alt you think you need and end up never logging in.
---
Itsa me! Have not played srsly for a long while.
---
&gt; PL crying about being blobbed with Supers
---
Reap what you sow, not very fun is it.
---
Sandboxes offer more than one way to play, if you want to currently win at EVE, there is only one way to play, so EVE's not a sandbox.
---
What gameplay issues? seems to be running fine from what I can see
---
Didn't this guy just call all Germans n\*\*\*\* in that tweet? I understand roleplaying a bad dude in a video game, but isn't twitter like...public to even people outside eve?
---
I've met many dumb people, but he takes the cake.
---
I see alot of "what issue are we protesting?"
---
Fuck it. No more skill injectors. Let's do a log out to get rid of skill injectors then. We all hate them and hate seeing 1 day old alts in Rorqs and Titans.
---
I think he's referring to the troll B4R astra.
---
PL has literally never been the largest entity what kind of crack are you smoking?
---
you see, with the current auto chess hype theres a chance that this could turn out as a successful project, therefore CCP will not do it.
---
Just need to get rid of Dancul now
---
If they, and skill injectors for that matter, had never been implemented we would have seen a much more protracted arms race that would not necessarily have a clear winner. Imagine that. Fighting wars that are decided by their battles, and not by whoever has more clinically brain dead krabs. Just removing both of those now doesn't accomplish anything, because the damage has already been done.
---
none of us ever cried about it, we just did our best to find content in spite of them, and when it became apparent that we weren't gonna be allowed to do anything on our content deployment without getting tapi supers dropped on our heads, we decided to stop feeding them content on their doorstep and just went home
---
if my post reads to you like crying, you must have a really weird concept of what human emotions are like
---
Sure, we fight yall up north. There has been a small gang marathon going down in frat staging for the past few days. Brave's staging always has some action. Catch is just generally active. Delve is always good for hunting krabs.
---
There is more content than you can shake a stick at, and thanks to ansiblex gates most of the universe is 5-10 minutes away from d-p.
---
Anyone not getting content is missing it because they arent interested, not because there is no content.
---
The way I see it, CCP will do it and later on kill it after launch.

i'm not saying be mean to the guy because it's a fucking video game and a lot of nerds ITT need to get over themselves, but there are a few people in eve who probably have a legitimate reason to not be too fond of him

Nah... though individuals that played eve do define the narrative, after all is said and done, it was always the development of the game and decisions made by its creators that drove its story. Decisions by the development team to for example, include isk and tie it to real world money, were among the biggest driving forces for change in eve, and by extension reasons to play. just look at what happened when they removed eve bet... for a lot of people the game ended that day, though for many it would take a while for them to realize it.  All the infrastructure that supported the teams who competed in the alliance tournament were a huge part of the general activity in eve whether anyone realized it or not, and one simple decision made sure it all went away.  I feel this was ultimately ccp turning their back on the principles that made their game wildly popular in the first place.  they used to have a good sense for these things (they being Hilmar and his team of big ups at CCP) but eventually they lost it, or they caved to the pressure of the share holders to put out a less risky game with some of the sharp edges buffed away... but yea... once they made that choice, they killed the reason for all those big personalities to stay invested.  so  those personalities will always be there lying in wait, but ultimately its up to the developers to give them a place in the stay

Some people just don't have perspective at all, geez
---
do-you-not-have-a-spacebar-key?

Mmm, I'm not sure. The Homeworld models are stylized - each race has its own distinctive style (And HW 1's Kushan ships are goddamn fantastic), whereas Eve's are... well, they look detailed and individual, but they are a jumbled mess. Can't be helped, I suppose, after all the additions over the years.

You should join We Form V0lta, We would have alot of fun!
---
And we can't affect the game in a major way (other than when we wipe entire fleets with bombers) :D
---
well let me be honest, if you think you can ignore ccp to focus on some single factors that are caused by ccp then you are doing it wrong.
---
this game is facing some serious problems. the meta of the game is in a worse condition than in the last 2 decades before, and we have to do something about it. 
---
ccp sadly only understands a single language: beeing annoying and toxic and maybe causing some bad articles about them. nobody gives a fuck about the few new players reading this sub when there are literally 5000 old players quitting the game in a single week
---
Its okay i guess...... for something you look at once or twice or never, cuz you cant even be in highsec... rip pirates
---
Historically speaking, "modern" refers to the period post-WW1 and ending sometime after the Korean war.
---
How do you know it's over?
---
It's not. But why release it with three boring lead up phases that nobody cares about? They aren't building tension or anything, they just fill the time until the trigs do something wortwhile.

Living propaganda.

I don't think their non-CCP characters get nuked just put on ice until they no longer work for CCP. Then the characters are reinstated and returned to the owners.

Have you ever heard about causality???

the behavior of the players is CAUSED by CCP. please, get that in your brain!!!!!!!!!!!!

You should really, really create a Discord. That's the easiest way to get people up to date and remind them again when you have tournaments going.

I have to say iam a off and on player, first account made 2010, next 13 and now back in 19. I always struggled with the game due to lack of pve content, iam just not in eve pvp, to slow and boring for me. With the addition of the injectors CCP did the right thing. Not a lot of new players come and stick with the game, due to the massive amount of retarted high/low sec griever, which ruin the new player experience. With injectors you are able to now get quick your skills for what you want to do and enjoy the game in a way you want, not depending on the time gated skill learning. This is just my pov, and iam a proud Visa warrior who will spent as much money as i want to support the devs, cause i love the eve universe and relaxing atmosphere, but i dont give a shit about the playerbase, these eltists like goons, pl, who think the game is theirs, and they decide whats fun and whats not by content block a huge amount of the playerbase due to their sov attitude. So CCP, pls shut up and take more of money 😎 my wallet screams to purchase more stuff from you 🤗
---
It’s basically the same game with a few new skins.
---
What a strong shitpost, excellent start to the day r/EVE.
---
The upvotes say different though :o
---
That might help.However can you imagine the cries of the eve community over how this is unfair since the goons have so many already .
---
What are alphas?
---
Hi, are you one of Mr. Gianturcos peons, getting sold as testing mobs to other game companies and overall working everyday for his good living? Don't worry, the brain you handed over on entry of the club will be taken good care of, you wont need it as long as you are in this club ....
---
It should be as close as possible to a planetary warp-in, which means 1,000km off the warp-in. The drifter warps to a random planet or wormhole every hour or so.
---
the astra have to be 1000km from a poco. when the difter come to the poco, atract him to the citadel (anti cap fit).
---
How do you know he didn't spawn those himself? Also, eve uni is wrong, anti-cap missiles (anti-super in fact) will do considerably more damage.
---
Do Sansha ships count? The Succubus, Phantasm and Nightmare are all excellent hulls built for shield tanking, with laser platforms. 
---
Other than that, Oracles usually fit a weak shield tank, Bhaalgorns can be forced into a shield tank due to fleet comp restrictions (this is mostly for wormhole fleets), and I can't really think of any other Amarr ships that commonly fit shields.
---
Remember the 21day trial? Everything that you didn't have enough time to train for under that is locked off but you can play for an unlimited amount of time for it. When your sub lapses you become an alpha until you resub. This means you could log on and fly a few of your ships around right now.
---
I couldn't even log in. The servers were in a worse state than they are right now and everybody and their dogs and grannies were hammering the login for some Jita doomsday action. Myself included.
---
After 5 hours I gave up.
---
Wow PL can't harass brave and test anymore because they have supercapitals? Wow it's like they've actually learned from PL bashing them over the head for years! *surprised pikachu*
---
Eve now has two types of clones: alpha, which has limited skill access, half the SP learning speed and other limitations... But it's free. The Omega clone is the full-access version of the clone without the slowed down skill acquisition or other limiters. But you have to pay for it with Plex or real money.
---
Also, Plex is no longer an item - it's now a currency:)
---
After a few days, you'll get the hang of it back again: it took me a week. 
---
There are some balance changes, structures work a bit differently but mostly it's graphic changes.
---
Do you honestly believe this will change anything as far as  bots are concerned  ?
---
it is ! Black holes last a stupid amount of time. Their evaporation via hawking radiation is basically negligible in regard to their total mass. 
---
(There might be exceptions to this with some forms of primordial, smaller black holes, but we haven't detected those)
---
But, yeah. Heat death will happen way, way before the first stellar mass black hole evaporates.
---
Get deleted bro.
---
What do you think of greatly limited storage capacity for stations? Something that would make it logistically difficult for large groups to amass fleets much larger than smaller groups.
---
Current structures could remain with a higher capacity equal to their current contents + a bit more and recieve a visual to indicate the legacy status. New structures would take on the new limitations.
---
This plus resource scarcity might break up the big groups a bit without being overly invasive. idk theres probably plenty of holes in the idea but it kinda makes sense to me thematically that there should be a limit to how much stuff a station can realistically hold.
---
The kills are from 2017-11-11, a bit stale but good kills nonetheless.
---
More content but less general isk making overall to fund said content, sure the amount of isk made by non-bot players is marginal depending on efficiency, but this would in a way negativity affect smaller null sec corps that might need that isk to fund their own operations.... I say go for it I like content even if I can't pvp to save my own soul.
---
&gt; What do you think of greatly limited storage capacity for stations? Something that would make it logistically difficult for large groups to amass fleets much larger than smaller groups.
---
Have you ever been to 1dq?
---
In the end, this kind of change will modify the current meta (empire building) and will reverse the game to its state from 5 years ago (rental empire).
---
The change to remove/reduce rental empire was REQUIRED by the community as big powerhouses had occupied 5-10 regions and "there was no space for the little guy".
---
Now, there is enough space but most ppl don\`t want to do the work to build and empire and ask for nerfs aimed at those that did the work.
---
vOv
---
I think it have something to do about fact that eve is a product that need to be sold.        
---
The moment CCP put a hard limit on those spawns a huge number accounts will lose their reason for existence - thus will be unsubscribed.             
---
This is what you get for trading real people for more alt accounts.          
---
But i can be wrong.
---
There is a ton of surplus of those guns from when they dropped since nobody wanted them.

I highly doubt it, if it were technical they would likely say so instead of announcing it was coming and then sweeping it under the rug.  this reeks of ::ccpolitics::

Nice, is it for sure its their only hq for all those wardecs? If so RIP
---
Hey look, the spy lost his mentor. Doom took it way too far, especially out of game. So how about you take your condoning bullshit and shove it.
---
You cannot accrue skillpoints after 5mil (but 20mil total are available for alphas to use if they have it) but under that 5mil limit yes there is no cap to how many characters you can train for free.
---
Literally just group up with other people who can fly tornados. Just brick tank a bait sigil and fucking blap pirat proteuses. Dont forget an instablap svipul for their pods because they're rocking mid and high grade slaves. 
---
You only need about 15 tornados to easily 1 shot a prot no matter how bling it is. Just fight them in the most unfun doctrines you can imagine.
---
&gt; that **nobody** cares about?
---
  Judging by the numers of people running them- That is bullshit. I know reddit is an excellent echo chamber for rhetoric but comeon.
---
I heard it's HQ for \~70% of them. But might be wrong intel.
---
perspection is ever so slightly off. but holy damn this is a cool piece. really nice to look at and highly detailed. thanks for sharing
---
Love this!
---
Citadels in J space are good, but only if there was a cap per system. 
---
They're just way too convenient
---
That’s why I welp dreads on PH space. They give me good fights so I give them content. ty
---
The number of people running them is pretty low considering they are being built up as powerful enough to destabalize the NPC empire, which are hilariously OP in the lore. The trigs are being characterised as a possibly apocalyptic even for New Eden. A few dozen people running them is not really appropriate
---
anyone has a screenshot of the EGO skins?
---
On this occasion a new line of ship skins from Sansha Nation will be released. 
---
**True Deliverance**      
---
Including the Revenant!
---
&gt;I was simply countering your suggestion with how it doesn't really solve the problem you think exists. I am not convinced injectors are a problem.
---
It is a fact that it exists. This is a case where CCP is making money off of not fixing balance issues, so if you ask for too much, you probably get nothing. If you think there is a chance to get a complete removal, I would support it.
---
CSM summit 12:
---
&gt;Quant mentions that the game design and economy changes after skill trading and plex is very complicated due to the monetary exchange involved. Such as players buying supercapitals and the skills and then it being nerfed for the sake of a healthier game.
---
&gt;Activate a different one, there, no delay.
---
How do you figure that if there is a 5 min activation delay?
---
&gt;No, they are literally ideas. Also, you didn't present much about how this solved your supposed problems.
---
Its obvious that if you have too much isk coming in, and you nerf it, you get less isk coming in, but we are also way past such a discussion because CCP doesnt care.
---
&gt;No. In that regard, my concern is just with the ability to adequately recognize bots with automated systems. 
---
The problem with that concern is that it is in line with doing nothing because "not perfect".
---
&gt;What is the difference between a bot and some that afk runs sites while watching local?
---
You would have much more information than that.
---
I will laugh hard if they loose their shit
---
Trying to do stuff is not the same as actually doing stuff. WWB/Casino War was his last hurrah.
---
Really nice video dude
---
Good luck on your travels, if you want to be able to more easily access more remote areas of Eve, try learning how to fly an interceptor, they're fast, and ignore those pesky bubbles that people leave lying around in nullsec.
---
so your saying we should all stop complaining?
---
complaints got the tutorials created.
---
complaints got balance patches to make this game even exist now for you to play
---
what you see as complaints is feedback.
---
unfortunatly the link is dead on your post,
---
if instead you are saying players should be nicer to newguys.
---
eve is a sandbox, for it to be so then players can choose to do and feel what they want.
---
this includes helping new guys or not. for every person you meet that puts you down or kills you or tells you your dumb, there will be another player who will help you.
---
its about where YOU put yourself, and WHO you surround yourself with. this is no cearbear baby nursey. look out for yourself. and take criticism on the chin and hold that chin up.
---
No, u
---
if you say so mister goon propaganda drone

You obviously want a sugar hit event with instant gratification and massive awards.
---
  It's the first one. That's not even over. In HIGHSEC.
---
  Regardless if the event itself you and many others threw the "fuck CCP" hats on to bash whatever they revealed. Which for this event was just a single trailer and sneaky stuff in SISI...
---
Supers and caps wont be fixed until they are given a niche they excel at, instead of being just a bigger better subcap.
---
They are leaving because they are loosing. We need fighter in front of us not looser that doesnt undock.

Bye bye! Nothing will be missed.

Perfect. See you soon.

I feel you.
---
But honestly, I considered the new expansion as kind of a joke tbh. So far it just seems like an easily farmable empire space incursion, so basically another incursion besides Sansha. I get that trigs are actually powerful, and are fully capable of fucking someone up, but only if the player decides to take that risk.
---
What I'm getting at is that I firmly believe that this should've been something that actually tilted every day life in Eve. Right now, I can pretend the expansion never came out because it has zero bearing on my life in null, besides some neat QoL changes (new agency window looks pretty slick, ngl). There's no consequence for simply pretending the world ark doesn't exist.
---
It should be the opposite. That thing should have the ability to invade any 1 region it wants to AT LEAST once a month. I'm not saying it should nuke a bunch of Keepstars in Delve and then dip out. In fact, I haven't completely pieced together a working idea on how it would interact with Citadels at all. But it definitely should be a Titan killer, but also require the presence of multiple Titans in order to take it down. Some kind of strong, anti-carrier mechanic that disables you from simply poking it at 1500km until it dies (like an extended range PDS; you won't be throwing frigates at it anyway). Something fun that actually puts a strain on big alliances and makes their FCs give a shit and rethink their tactics, just for that once-a-month instance that it appears. By strain, I mean once it spawns in system, it should decrease ADMs and put in constellation-wide debuffs (similar to what Incursions and certain WHs do). Could you imagine the shitstorm that would brew if that kind of power spawned in 1DQ1-A? And the fun we'd actually have trying to kill it? 
---
The only few walls I've hit with this idea is 1) how would interact with Citadels? It definitely shouldn't be able to nuke Keepstars and 2) what about loot and bounty payouts? How much ISK distribution is fair when you're throwing super caps at a PVE element, knowing that you might lose several Titans? 3) How would we prevent it from nuking smaller alliances who don't have a supercap umbrella without simply saying you can just ignore it for a day or so and it'll despawn?
---
Idk man, I'm just disappointed. I was super hyped for it, and I wanted it to be a really fun, engaging, and risky opportunity.
---
SCRUBS
---
So cooling lasers are a thing, [kinda](https://www.physicscentral.com/explore/poster-spots.cfm). Heat is just the vibration of atoms, so if you take a laser, and fire it just right so that the protons impact the atoms in a way that reduces their vibrations instead of increasing them, it actually cools the atom in question. Now, what it would take to make that work outside the atomic scale is mind-boggling, but then again so are spaceships that experience drag.
---
Was it that obvious? 100% pure fun
---
I'm hoping plenty of newbie corps tag along to help smash it to bits
---
We only have to pay for non amarr fuel because we mined helium tools therefore they are free
---
Well 1st world weaponry manufacturers have to keep "the market" in motion .... so buying a "revolution" here and faking an "incident" there is a common thing. The blueprint for "revolutions" was created 1953 in Iran called "Operation Ajax" (just google it)
---
I'll get the change.org petition ready ok? /s
---
Do you accept players who don't join coms? because in his case you would notice his voice if he joined. Some lower profile devs might be able to do that though.
---
&gt; Now, there is enough space but most ppl don`t want to do the work to build an empire and ask for nerfs aimed at those that did the work.
---
Yes there is so much space and no one is taking it ... Gee I wonder why, maybe people don't want to suffer structure timer warfare all that to just krab.
---
BUT THE MITTANI
---
He leaves the moment PL/NC can't helicopterdick supers around the cluster?
---
SMA really they may have been allies but no one in the main alliance have control over what that group of idiots did.  If that’s the best example you have it’s a nice try.
---
Oh ok I didnt realize that did I was wondering why I was getting so much from my mining drones. I have that at 5.

Gotg go with goon because of Elo and Gobb.

Then under that definition, I lose, and that's okay because it doesn't harm my experience of the game.

This is what happens when the most rewarding  type of gameplay (ISK-wise) includes staring at a moon for hours on multiple screens .... EVE2k19
---
It's not a riot if everyone on reddit logs off for 30 minutes...
---
  People give /r/eve too much credit- It's around 100 shitposters who rage at CCP- 1100 people who lurk and make the odd meme post. 
---
  Compare that to the 18,000 people online *right now* in AUTZ... Who do you think CCP listens to? Edgelords on a reddit sub? Or emailed surveys and players logged into the game?
---
  We almost need a /r/ccpls sub so people can shout in a box about the "state of the game" in peace, and leave this sub for memes, propaganda, and picking on spaceship alliances like the good ol' days. (Kugu needs to come back)
---
*bring sajuuk to bear! BRING SAJUUK. TO. BEAR.*

Skill injectors, extractors, changes to plex, Chnages to capital warfare, New capital logistics ships, No more triage carriers, HAW Capital weapons (Anti subcap guns), New DD weapons, new plazer built structures, new plazer built gates, reworked moon mining, new interface, new faction ships, new T2 logi frigs, command destoryers, T3 destroyers, New playable concord ships, skins, quite lot more but hard to remember the differences from back in 2012

&gt;There was no space for the little guy
---
&gt;Now people just don't want to put the effort in to have 1000 rorqs and a super umbrella
---
Isn't this literally the same thing??? The fuck can the `little guy` do with null sov besides bot, since the `good` income is all balanced around super umbrellas
---
So for example, if a blueprint requires 7 of a component for a run, it will only need 13 of them for 2 runs.
---
If i want to run that blueprint 50 times, how can i know how many components I will need to buy without having some unused leftovers at the end ?

Feel free to come anytime you want. We welcome content. :)
---
At least with Incarna it was about "greed is good". There was a clear objective and it stirred people up.
---
  Now? It's a mix of rabbled shouts and moaning cries from people who are throwing random ideas from "end all botting forever"- As if CCP had the tools to do this all along (they dont), to "delete local", or "delete supers" thinking it would magically 'fix the game'.
---
  The problem is: The sandbox. People play the game their way- which means the masses are risk averse, who only want to win, and are terrified of losing their blingy big ship and getting memed on on reddit.
---
  Frankly thank fuck for groups like FRAT who throw ships into the fight and take a risk. Goons jumped ship and ran in WWB. PL/NC are jumping ship and running now.
---
  Back in the day (2012) people *fought wars defensivly*... Isn't that a strange concept?
---
&gt; No more bitching on reddit, no more CCPlease, no more “I know how to fix this!”.
---
  This sums up all of reddit tho
---
Ok so how do you bring more people into the game OP?
---
It seems to me that just about all the good income are either in wormholes or in npc space. Sov null is actually not that good for earning isk
---
We just had a new expansion with highsec stuff rolling out (invasion) yet people from day 1 were bitching about it here. CCP can't win no matter what they do
---

naa I was there, still have old screenshots of it- lots of rainbow lasers
---
2007 called, they want their catchphrases back
---
Because making ISK is fucking boring and it should be made in the more efficient way possible to have more time for pvp.
---
We are leak proof, so nobody but us would know :)
---
Problem solved!
---
This Skin looks like a Hot Drop i put in my Toilet
---
yeah sov null is only good income if you multibox rorqs or run a bot farm, if you actually want to make decent income as a human player you should 100% own a C6, run L5s, farm burners, blitz FW L4s etc, if you're unironically running VNIs in nullsec using your human brain and human eyes you're working for less than the vietnamese kid who made your socks
---
the only excuse to ever run a VNI is if you have a random alt that's SP farming and you literally warp it to a site, deploy drones, then tab out for 1/2 an hour
---
Really fun video mate , gj
---
Yes
---
I got laid with your mom
---
See I done that for 12 years , if I went for a job now I would have to explain why I basically vanished off the face of the earth for over a decade , haha so yeah adding that to your Cv should be a thing :)
---
our entire alliance deployed to division 2
---
You can clearly see he was actively rolling
---
why do you guys think pgl spends so much time afk? or vily? or asher? or kendarr? why do you think that every major content creator thinks the game is fucked?  
---
doom was getting helicopter dicked on by supers over a year ago, and pl were infamously dumpstered in B-R. none of that is new, what's new is that ccp are patching out enjoyable pvp.
---
nice 1
---
Is that because you don’t login ?

You don't need a cloak to take a blops bridge. The hull needs to be capable.

good morning

fix citadels
---
A dev called T20 stole spawned some t2 bpos for his alliance , it also aided in the hatred for band of brothers at the time , no one likes a cheater in eve
---
Beautiful, but the fuck does that mean?
---
You're kind of stuck then because most Amarr ships lack enough mid slots to fit a proper shield fit. Maybe for PvE you could make it work for ratting against things that shoot Explosive/Kinetic (Angel Cartel, Minmatar) since the shield already has good base resistances, but you'd be using Lasers that do Em/Thermal, the wrong damage type to use. Unless you fit projectile turrets on Amarr ships, which some people can sometimes do for a variety of reasons, but I wonder what the difference is since you don't get the bonus damage from the ship.
---
For dps, note that more than around 3 dps mods doesn't really have an impact on dps. You'd be using a whole slot for something like 5 dps more, then another for 3 and maybe a last one for 1 dps (assuming 6 low slots). You're much better off fitting 2-3 dps mods and filling the rest with tank (as intended). In a PvP fight, you will last longer and therefore deal more damage overall (because you deal damage over more seconds). If you want more dps, you're better off blinging your mods rather than using more.
---
Finally, you shouldn't focus only on Armor or only on Shields after your initial start in Eve. The Hull Upgrades skill give you 5% to armor hitpoints, for example, and that is very useful even on primarly shield ships since it usually gives you at least a couple hundred EHP. That little more armor is often enough to save your ship since it might give you another rep cycle from a repper. Shield hitpoints give you a little bit more time to activate an armor repper (since they only heal at the end of a cycle), so Shield Management is very good on armor ships too.
---
Also, why don't you like armor? Is it because of the plates that slow you down? You don't always have to fit plates in a tank, often only a Damage Control (which you can treat as an armor tank mod), some armor resist modules and an armor repper are necessary for a good armor tank. A plate let's you survive more alpha damage (a lot of damage in a very short amount of time, but that comes periodically, like every 20 seconds), but often resists + reps will do a much better job of dealing with more incoming dps. Resists are better than buffer in situation where you don't expect a lot of alpha (PvE, solo PvP, small/medium fleet PvP).
---
Also note that shield also has it's own drawbacks. The increase in signature doesn't seem like much of a drawback until your frigate gets blapped off the field by a cruiser or battleship that has a much easier time tracking you because of the increased sig. Your enemy will hit you more often whatever guns they use.
---
“Lose”
---
Noeeeeeeessssss
---
They grow so huge because they're already huge and offer safety. The real 'content' in this game is something with more thought put into it than 'take ansiblex and go small gang shooty'. I'm talking about wars, big conflicts and people loosing things that actually matter. Remember when supercap fleets got baited, or when a few competent people could absolutely disable regions of incompetent retards with the proper planning and logistics? There used to be really complex plans that blew my mind.

5 mph accident, bumper might have dent
---
50 mph accident. Car is likely totaled.
---
Same result?
---
&gt;So what are the specific demands?  
---
1. Change Null SOV mechanics
---
2. Buff Heavy Missiles
---
3. Make an active highslot module to allow BlOps to modify max jumpable mass/duration on wormholes under 3b to make caps more employable and allow higher risk engagements across wormhole classes while also giving BlOps BBs an application.
---
4. Give the Damavik its range bonus back.
---
2.6b ship is hardly bullshit lmao. There's plenty of people I've met who use fits like that for nullsec/WH PvE without getting into Carriers. Do I think that's the best idea? ...Not necessarily. But it does happen, and it's not even that infrequent.
---
I just returned after about 3 years away. Took me about a month to get up to speed on things (null sec). New mechanics, the current meta, every one and their mother has a capital and a titan now. Lots of little things have changed. Hard to pinpoint what really. Still feels the same tho. Still great. Loving it. 
---
Log back in and don't rush it. You'll be flying high before you know it.

soo if hilmar play the game why in the last "ask my anything" he said "SKill injector are healthy for the game"

dafuq

to be fair he know there a problem with skill farm but nothing happen why ?

is it even fit? are they actually using it? or is it just a place holder citadel that costs nothing to place as an hq for wardec purposes?

---
That's a lot of text to not answer my question.
---
I am well aware of the drawbacks of fitting shields on Amarr, juts want to know if some have done it successfully.
---
A quick one on DPS, you are right that you don't benefit from 3 mods but you can have 3 for drones and 3 for lasers.
---
My idea would be to use midslots and rigs for shield resists and low slots for passive shield recharge, I believe it can negate a lot of DPS.
---
Because of stuck scene switcher it is less obvious that I thought. I have 3 windows, 2 of them was rolling wh on rolling megs and got caught, and then my main on normal meg tried to help.
---
Is that a serious question?
---
Yes!
---
This is kind of what happens anyway in wormholes, if you will into a decent corp and ask to brawl you will typically only get +1nd, as in they have a single pilot more than you, and you will almost always get a decent fight.
---
There are some exceptions and occasionally you will roll into someone trying to anchor something or someone doing a mining op and they will blob you to protect their expensive assets, but they usually don't chase and will roll off the hole for you.
---
&gt; They are leaving because they are **loosing.** We need fighter in front of us not **looser** that doesnt undock, so nothing will be lost.
---
not empty quoting
---
Man I forgot about this! 
---
I started in 2016 so the event in 2017 was crazy confusing. Ships and people everywhere. 
---
So many meme fits floating around. Definitely a fond memory even tho I spent my time mostly dieing and trying the find another ship! 
---
They had awesome instructions for getting setup and a discord to help. Max skills so you could fly anything you found. Would love to do it again even if I'm still bad ;)
---
I'm not the biggest fan of goons, but it doesn't really help any conversation around game balance to deny what ya'll have done.
---
out of game, you might try a tool like eve isk per hour
---
alternatively, just mock up the job in game to get exact totals
---
exactly! ;)
---
Nah V0lta is more active than ever
---
Why is that thing even in piak??? Why not in Gererique? thats like the furthest highsec, in the end of solitude... or Kattegaud in molden heath...
---
its like they are not even trying...
---
You can also see there's 2 megas on grid. My assumption is the one that can't give chase and ends up dying to running out of cap charges was the one doing that actual rolling and the one that is the focus of the video came out in response.
---
we hesitated between Toilet Paper and Les bogoss' du 93 wesh t'as vu gros
---
Oh what a time to be alive
---
Because that is what people do sometimes. Quit playing.
---
Bobby Atlas quit playing EVE at a time the game was considered at its high point. So did Shadoo and others who were content creators. Did they also quit because of CCP?
---
It's even funnier when you mention test leadership, because they have the keys to to go to war with goons. Nah, let's just keep blaming CCP for no content.
---
Sure, I'm out.
---
shouldnt have evicted calmil and galmil and pirates then fucking retards lmao
---
Karma is a bitch aint it
---
True, this moon mining fuck up the balance.
---
Maybe. If you’re a couple months in and trained some of the magic 14, you should have evasive maneuvering somewhere on your queue / done
---
A "hard limit" carries some downsides...
---
1. Heavily-used systems could completely deplete their spawns by the time another user gets on.
---
2. It would favour people in supers, who could run them before anyone else had an opportunity because they could complete them so fast. Thus further enriching the already wealthy.
---
3. It would put more money into the pockets of landlords as renters would need to increase the number of systems they owned. Further concentrating funds.
---
Instead, there needs to be some dynamic adjustments...
---
1. Add a "Player Threat Index" that controls the spawns of sites and their NPCs based on the ships used to run the site. Start running them with supers and the threat index skyrockets, and then based on that index...
---
2. Reduce the rate at which higher level sites spawn
---
3. Add additional warp-scrambling NPCs to every site. At a maxed out player threat index sites should spawn multiple HICs and a dozen warp scrambling frigates.
---
4. Being ran by AFK ishtars all of the time? Player threat index should start spawning lots of webbing elite interceptors. 
---
Further, a player threat index should apply like heat over the local map. If you raise the PTI in one system it should also increase it in neighbouring systems, but by a smaller amount.
---
What do you need for autochess to work in EVE?  
---
You need some ships and some dedicated pilots for the ships that are willing to fly under the two different "players" commands. You train your gladiators, you buy your ships, and you sell their services to third parties who wish to play. You supply the ships, customers supply the compensation for the ships and the pilots time, and everyone has a great laugh.
---
I joined TEST in 2018 to super rat, I hate PL btw.
---
I started playing in 2017, Joined TEST in 2018 to super rat, I fucking hate PL btw.
---
Be nice. He only knows how to spell "Brisc."
---
There are basically two sorts of blocs in EvE.
---
There are those who make renters pay isk to mine/rat, and use that isk to subsidise PvP.
---
There are those who organise supercapital umbrellas of PvPers, and have their miners and ratters use that space to build more supercapitals to strengthen the supercapital umbrella.
---
The first group would rapidly mine out "their" systems, but be unable to move to new ones due to the rentals contracts that limit them to particular systems.
---
The second group would move the supercap umbrella, slowly rotating it so their miners/ratters can follow it to new areas (note rorqs and ratting capitals have jump drives, and VNIs can gate pretty quickly).
---
Therefore, if your changes were put in place, the Imperium and Legacy would be fine. They just organise a moving umbrella.
---
On the other hand, it'll greatly inconvenience "traditional" renting organisations, like PanFam.
---
Horde, on the other hand, would probably adapt.
---
70% is about right. It is easy just go through there wars and count the pick HQ wars and then you get about 70% maybe even more. Best thing is 2 weeks they cannot to this wars after it is dead ^^
---
Oh, I'm completely on your side here. The problem with your AoE DD is just that it might feel too much like a "you loose" button. It can't really just waltz into a region and be like "fight me and lose supers or don't and lose structures".  As for that thing about citadels, I think it would be somewhat fair if they could kill a Keep over the course of 24 hours during a continual siege of sorts, but will retreat if they loose to many ships. But the problem is really not making it feel unfair. Sure you should loose assets when fighting it, but not in a way where you feel like you couldn't have avoided it.
---
A few years ago, the main argument was that everything was too sparse, that people couldn't live together in one system and had to spread out.
---
I think the problem here is that some small (or large) number of players embrace the current meta, optimise it and gain an advantage over those who don't, leading to complaints and moaning.
---
sorry, "should" should be shouldn't.
---
As someone playing on potato pc, thank you ! I just need a new pair of underwear now.
---
I agree lol, it's miles ahead of any other games I've played. 
---
Things like automatic payments when losing ships during battles, permission systems, tracking all kinds of data and other random tools all connected directly to the game. Don't think any other game comes close to that
---
Just drop more structures
---
Could you give us your fit?
---
Nvm that go visit Simple Farmer land in catch

the more you know

&gt; It is a fact that it exists
---
Citation needed.
---
&gt; How do you figure that if there is a 5 min activation delay?
---
Because different players aren't affected by others activation delays.
---
&gt; Its obvious that if you have too much isk coming in
---
So is your issue what people can do with the isk or the amount of isk they have? You're getting very confusing.
---
&gt; The problem with that concern is that it is in line with doing nothing because "not perfect".
---
Well, they do ban bots.
---
Do you think that getting rid of all the bots is worth getting rid of real players too? Or that all bots should be eliminated up to standards that would affect real players and no further? Somewhere in between?

&gt; You would have much more information than that.

---
Technically you’re right but as a newer player myself none of that magic 14 is presented in that way.  It’s incumbent on the player to find that skill plan.   
---
It took the 1.1m SP for me to finally get a Ceptor trained on my 4th character.  The first three still don’t have it.  
---
The game shows you all these other ships and activities that then get you to prioritize skilling in those directions and not filling in a magic 14.
---
PL is one of the most active alliances in eve despite their numbers, you might need to rethink your leaders narrative
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/ this is also a great calculator for that

Woah, a thread where CCP isn't getting bashed.

this is fun for me to watch happen here

&gt; the Casino War
---
The what war?
---
The problem is that the game offered places and niches for all of those groups, the ones that love to grind ISK in peace and the ones that love to disturb this. Since 2017 Lifeblood patch this balance is gone ... completely  ... from 100 to 0 in one day.
---
How come citadel rebalance and curbing super proliferation isnt on here?
---
Eve will win
---
Beats the static and unchanging landscape. Also, citadels are harder to move so it would probably mean more demand for PI stuff and salvage.
---
Simple, turn all capital ships into isk.
---
Get est price +100/200/300m isk for trouble and a set price for the hull and delete the ship.
---
BPO's of the capitals are used no longer for building the capital but for t2 invention

 I mean even w/a scan res of 3k+ you're not catching pods of people that know what they're doing in HS without smartbombs. Can fit a 12m maller w/smartbombs that will do the trick, and yeah they should be 1.5b+ pods really.
---
Sounds great on paper a reset. But would create such a rift in eve that I see many quit.  
---
What do you do with implants. Strategic dread caches that have been build up becoming worthless overnight.   
---
Some people are rocking their big toys for a long time. What price will they get ? Also people are attached to their ships . Not to mention the ME / TE research that took years to get.  
---
And lastly CCP didn't rollback something as broken as T2 BPOs so I don't see them delete peoples capitals. The only thing I can remember they disabled were mines. Maybe the older players know more examples
---
Entity with the largest, most overwhelming capital and super-capital force. I'm glad to see that semantics is still alive and well.
---
Horde standing fleet is some of the best fun you can have in Eve
---
Hmmm we must play on different servers then.
---
Just give the player a BPC for the ship and the T1 inputs to produce the new T2 ship. It's not rocket science. And we certainly don't need to throw more ISK at this.

---
They have literally had the largest super capital force for the longest period of time in the game until the recent years and pretending to disseminate because they used proxy forces, meat shields and lacked raw numbers of thrasher pilots in early years is entirely disingenuous and below you.

Your need to push a narrative is showing.
---
There are a lot more of them but iam not your news-tv moderator. You can search them yourself.
---
I don't normally do this, but i plan to login all of my accounts at downtime and leave them logged in while at work on this day.
---
The OP is the epitome of the ignorant shit that has been r/Eve over the past few weeks.
---
I can believe and respect that.
---
Are there any freeport citadels close to Jita that I can put a jump clone in for swapping out my training clone when I run abyssal filaments? I have a habit of dying in them.
---
Less farming=&gt;less people in space=&gt;less target=&gt;less pvp
---
I love how people want nerf before thinking of consequence.
---
I think the main argument against a hard respawn cap w/o decreasing the efficacy of farming in general is that any reasonable cap that impacts the game is going to fuck over people in different time zones.
---
E.g. if I was in an EUTZ alliance as a USTZ member and all our space has been turbokrabbed, I don’t get to PvE today. I suspect that’d have its own emergent solutions, however, so I don’t consider it a black mark against the idea.
---
did he just german shame me?
---
So, no gangbang?
---
Just use a travelinti and you are fine 😊
---
There was 3 megs. 2 was rolling and get caught on other side, both made it to wh. Then one died(window on top left), and other got saved when I changed main window to Leshak.
---
Only impact on fight from rolling Megs is tanking, on 7:52 you can see how RollMeg#2 warping away from grid.
---
Make it mutual before it ends. The war will get forcefully cancelled by the destruction of the HQ.
---
Fucked up the balance, like, you actually have to login and play the game to benefit from moons?
---
Lmfao at this mentality.
---
They dropped the wardec on all corps with this structure as their headquarters, and they will redec said corps in a day or 2, meaning no one gets a 2 week cooldown even if the structure goes down. basically what ccp did here is give wardeccers 5x cheaper wardecs, and the option to just drop the wardec for 1 day (compared to the old 1 week cooldown) once their structure hits hull timer.
---
It's related LP store is still there though.
---
https://youtu.be/HqUQah-jV4U
---
XtraSquishy made this joke a while ago and it perfectly fits suicide-scram/bubble moves for Dictors/Interceptors.
---
The dino should be more blubbery.
---
Can you post pics of the new sansha skins, especially phantasm?
---
Really glad the War HQ mechanic is fulfilling its intended purpose. Not only can people fight back, but it gives a unifying cause for all the newbie corps and such to pile on and give them something to be proud of.
---
Go CCP, and go newbie corps!
---
Also Try Eve Droid I find it easier to use while fitting
---
but thats hilarious 
---
why are people so salty about that
---
Shhh don't let them know you were repping me; it ruins the narrative.
---
Oh man, I can already see the player count rising!
---
It wont be for a couple hours before i get home you can go on sisi and see them for yourself. When i get home i will add it just in case
---
Ok before propose a change think how peopla will abuse it.
---
People will just move and follow umbrella... so you will just reduce the viability of little corp to survive in 0.0 ans reduce global content.
---
Ah yes, the well thought-out and thoroughly playtested Hisec wardec mechanics.
---
Wars are 7-day repeatable
---
Fuelled Hisec structures have a 5.5-day minimum reinforcement time from armor to final timer, with 24 hours minimum between shield and armor. For a total of 6.5 days in the absolute best case.
---
But as the wardeccer gets to choose the 7 day cycle period of their war and the reinforcement time of their structure and can choose to drop wars by not continuing to pay for the upkeep, they can ensure complete safety of their structure.
---
The wardecced entity could declare against the original wardeccer and kill the structure, but as the structure is not the HQ of the original wardeccers war (which has now ended) the wardecced entity cannot benefit from the immunity period and as they declared war, are still at war for another week, the ending of which was the objective in the first place.
---
Result: Absolutely no meaningful change in wardec mechanics
---
Even with changes to the reinforcement time of a HQ structure in hisec (say to 0.5 days minimum like in WH space) the problem would persist for competent wardeccing groups:
---
1. Wardeccers set HQ RF timer to someday (e.g. Wednesday 20:00) 
---
2. Wardeccers declare war such that from the first available combat time, the attackers would need to wait over 1 week to finish the missed structure timer (e.g. Monday 20:00, allowing combat Tuesday 20:00)
---
3. Wardeccers do not pay to maintain wars with all entities who were wardecced with that particular HQ. (Ending the war the following Tuesday 20:00)
---
4. Wardeccers re-declare with another HQ or wait until 24 hours before the structure repair time finishes to re-declare
---
ya the skins for sansha have been lacking for awhile all you had was the glacial drift and then the tourney skin. Its nice to see a new one for them. That animated caldari one though....
---
Because SP loss is the only thing that makes a T3C loss feel tangible anymore, it keeps it from being "welp, there goes a bil, time to krab"
---
If the SP loss was removed, a lot of what makes t3c's unique would also have to vanish. And there would be little chance for a T3C buff that many of them need, looking at the tengu in particular.
---
Instead of removing a unique mechanic, I would like to see it added to some more ships/more ships added with that mechanic. Specifically Titans and supers could be rebalanced to use a subsytem mechanic. One subsystem for jump bridges, one for phenomena generation, one for doomsday weapons, ECT. This would require Titan and super players to fit for the differing purposes that their ships serve and would allow for a slight buff while making them feel less oppressive on the battlefield.
---
If u dont want to "suffer" than dont do it ... but then dont complain that u cant access the same resources as those who do.
---
Also it seems I was not very clear about  what empire building means: recruitment, training, planning, organizing, logistics, propaganda, diplomacy, spionage, counterespionage, leadership, analysis, prognosis ... shall I continue? And TIME ... lots of time.
---
Don't worry they probably already started it. It'll release 2024 as a Sega Dreamcast exclusive.
---
Yes I know you like to circlejerk about how great of an "empire building" alliance you're part of, still is a lot easier when supercap umbrella can defend everything and killing structures and taking sov is the most cancer thing to do, all that whole invading people has almost no point at all because you can stack up 30k people inside a single region.
---
But yes please continue jerking off to how great empire builders you are.
---
That’s what I was told is going to happen. Mad world.
---
I'm not an expert but here it is an ideea: use diplomacy, ally with some empire, go to thier fleets, make a name for yourself, grow and become the next empire.  
---
I know, it requires a LOT of effort...
---
I would love a Website to Look for fits. The most importsnt Thing for me would be the abilitiy to search for fits with certain Modules. For example triple XLASB
---
On a vargur.
---
There is no blame on people ganked, their only defense is not logging in, and they did just that. Then dumbfuck ganktards started complaining about "population drop", and you totally did that by yourself. You can try blaming game mechanics that made ganking so easy a trained dog could probably pull it off, but it's still you who went for that lowest hanging fruit of all eve and pretend to be more than slacking morons who half-killed hisec in their pursuit of low-iq lifestyle.
---
great attitude. Perhaps next time ask them to let you go so you can keep on your merry way? :)
---
People attached to their ships are already breaking a common rule.
---
As for implants, said implants are usable for the "T2" capital once they're build.
---
CCP not deleting T2 BPO's is one hell of an miss in my opinion. It gives people way to much power.
---
You can also make the capitals flyable but unable to use modules (except the jump portal generation) and require them for the "T2" production like normal .
---
Will leave BPO's BPC's alone and introduce a new T2  BPC that can be invented.
---
Brings it all in line with normal T2 production of ships and allows CCP to rework capitals again.
---
People like to pretend that we suffer toxic leaders because they're somehow brilliant and irreplaceable when in reality it's just too much hassle to replace them.    
---
When they're gone other people will step up to fill the vacuum with varying degrees of success as it has been throughout all human history.
---
There must still be one elite pvper in PL right?
---
Tapi Drops supers on pl wherever they go
---
 \~several months later\~   
---
 pl: moves supers into range
---
 tapi: shocked pikachu face  
---
Also tapi: blues goons then spends the next 3 years saying it was out of necessity because pl were "invading test space"
---
war! make war!
---
Standard procedure ... when u dont have arguments to attack the message, attack the person.
---
&gt; still is a lot easier when supercap umbrella can defend everything and killing structures and taking sov is the most cancer thing to do, all that whole invading people has almost no point at all because you can stack up 30k people inside a single region.
---
&gt; Totally not related to game balance.
---
Here I removed the part you ego couldn't handled
---
It's because the players believe what their leaderships says. They can be like "my alliance A stronk" and then somehow join another alliance and be like "enemy alliance A shit"
---
He just couldn't get over the new rorqual changes
---
How is this not upvoted more
---
Yeah but op hasnt seen their first dread or titan yet, They havent died stranded in a wh yet, they havent seen a 500 titan drop yet, or what 1000 carriers actually looks like on screen. They havent escaped a battle with 3 points of structure left and two racks of burned modules. They havent ganked a freighter yet, or Have enough stuff to ship in a freighter. They havent built their first carrier, or died to a sleeper battleship. They havent run incursions for isk or sat in a their own titan. They havent woken up at 330 am to fight some oddly memeing asshats off a friendly citadel.
---
 Or done any of the thousand things you have done that make the game interesting.
---
Well they'd be mostly tackled all the time until they cleared the site, it would be a bit spamming :-)
---
So instead of rental empires we just have bigger alliances, where do you see "enough space"?
---
Hey Kappa, good to see you're still going!
---
FUCK YES
---
They let their war with IVY expire for this reason.
---
I've already been not logging in for months. Do I get a prize?
---
But then you could say put rules up for your alliances so every tz can do something "adapt or die" as goons like to say now.
---
We should just all blue goons, people!
---
found a sore spot did I?
---
Reminder that you need to be at least 150km off to warp down to the gate, don't make bookmarks too close!
---
Or both.
---
Wow, you seem quite mad
---
I have preemptively died inside when I've seen you hit that 2%. Very nice
---
We were laughing our asses off at PL in comms for jumping in so far away that most of the field was not in range of their titan's DD range.
---
This full on Post B-R all over again. Goons are winning, so this game is broke. Which leads to 1-2 prominent names bowing out, for max effect of the boohoo narrative. I hate to see Doom go, but lets not pin that entirely on the state of the game.
---
Reality is a tactical decision was made not to finish the job with WWB. It was an error, then subsequent error of not returning ro disrupt their growth was a nail in the coffin for the "other" playstyle. 
---
Its not the state of the game the entirely to blame here.
---
They dropped all war decs.. No one gets to shoot it
---
Yeah, I remember that, I think I suicide ganked you once for the lulz.
---
I was referring to the attempted revenge invasion that ended at UALX following the lul op that was your provi deployment.
---
/s/alt/bot
---
They are scared now.
---
Thats a NC. And PL line btw
---
Then s
---
This will be the first example to CCP that mechanics need further revision.
---
It's all good. We declared war. Yay.
---
you cannot multibox alphas though
---
You are right in theory, but that assumes Perfect action from Eve online players, which we all know is not the norm. People will mess up and get potted. It happens all the time.
---
They still "exist" but have still never seen anyone doing one.
---
How so?
---
Point is why bring a insta lock svipul which probably has like a 5% chance of catching the pod of someone from a corp like P I R A T when you can bring a cheaper SB ship that should really have a 100% chance of catching any pod in HS if you kill their ship.
---
Casino
---
Yes you did, I tend to react overly dramatic to obvious idocy
---
joining snuff?
---
I mean all they would really have to change was make it so that either you cannot drop a war once your War headquarters has been reinforced, or that if you fail to pay the bill, the two-week cool down goes into effect.
---
Wow the Caldari ones actually looks great.
---
Excuse me that new CEO isn't Itachi.
---
This is exactly the kind of content I had always hoped that a war headquarters structure would bring!
---
&gt;CITIZEN YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO POST HERE IF YOU DONT PLAY

---
=&gt;less people playing eve=&gt;game dies faster =&gt; the idea has achieved the complete opposite of what you expect
---
Thanks for doing this. Have you tried to recruit more people to help with this? Did not find any posts at the official forums regarding this. Also, the title of this topic is not really informative. I am sure you could get a lot more buzz by doing a post along the lines of "Evervus being reworked @github. Programming help and feedback welcome."
---
We do have these mechanics in WHs though they are a lot harder.   With limited sites you would need to rent a krabing system else you need to be on straight after down time.  Being able to clear the hole system will let you afford more rent, so someone who only has 2 hours a night in a VNI is going to find it hard to rent.  
---
This isn't that bad, but what goals does it accomplish.  Will it get more people in null?  Will we get more small gang roams?  I don't think its how we are going to get more small independent groups.
---
Hilarious!
---
Loki and Loki imo

Much like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody will ever expect it.

Cant log in for few more hours either so if anyone can post 😍
---
Well you're asking a very general question in a place where a lot of newbros ask questions, I can't assume any knowledge or skills on your part. If you want the real answer to your question, it always is, "it depends". Are we talking PvE? Solo/small-gang PvP? Fleet PvP? Are you looking for frigate-sized hulls? Battleships? Caps? Is this for a main doctrine or a smaller role like ewar if fleet PvP? Or is it just a hypothetic "can you mix Amarr with shield tanking" question?
---
For mixing laser and drone damage mods, which ship would benefit from that exactly? The Abaddon gains 70 dps from 3 DDAs, but you'd deal more damage overall if it was armor tanked because of better survivability. The Armageddon could use lasers instead of neuts, but you'd be doing less damage overall than an Abaddon because of the bonused hull (and you'd be losing out on shutting down an opponent with neuts). If your goal is max dps for a gank, use ships like the Talos and Catalyst, since you want to maximize damage/ISK investment.
---
What you're talking about is [Passive shield tanking](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Passive_shield_tanking). The best way to get a lot of tank doing this is to use shields that have a high recharge rate and shield capacity, so most Amarr ships are not your best choice of ships. Let's compare the Harbinger to the Hurricane (which can be passive shield tanked, often in PvE situations). They happen to have the same slot layout so they will have a pretty similar fitting. I will post the fittings used at the end of the post.
---
Hurricane (all V):  
---
45k EHP with 405 EHP/s of shield regen
---
587 DPS (491 guns + 96 from Drones) with 2709 alpha
---
225 m/s speed (no prop)
---
Cap stable
---
Harbinger (all V):
---
44k EHP with 356 EHP/s of shield regen
---
730 DPS (572 guns + 158 from Drones) with 2144 alpha
---
219 m/s speed (no prop)
---
Cap lasts 12m 54s (won't matter in PvP, but might in PvE)
---
Also note this is with perfect skills, your capacitor skills will matter in making the cap last this long.
---
Now compare this with a standard Armor Harbinger:
---
Harbinger (all V)  
---
41k EHP wtih 159 EHP/s of armor regen
---
769 DPS (610 guns + 158 drones) with 2777 alpha
---
464 m/s (afterburner)
---
Cap lasts 16m 58s  
---
And, of course, if we're talking Fleet PvP, you want to be buffer fit because you will have logi and the armor buffer fit will have a much larger buffer than the shield buffer. Another note is that the shield fit is much tighter than the Armor fit, so you can only fit Focused Medium  Beam Lasers instead of Heavy Beam Lasers, so you lose out on DPS, and you need perfect CPU fitting skills, a CPU implant, or you will have to meta or compact fit some modules.
---
So yes, it can be done, and it's pretty arguable which fit is better since you trade off DPS with rep/buffer. It really depends what you want to use it for. The armor fit will benefit greatly from having the prop in pretty much all situations. You will also want to use the armor fit against rats like Blood Raiders, replacing the explosive and general resist with an anti-em and anti-thermal resist. This will give you (against Blood Raiders and against all laser ships) 53k ehp and 237 EHP/s of rep power, since they fire EM/Thermal.

---
Died like everything else CCP puts out these days.
---
Will a 50mn MWD add more mass than the 100mn AB? The mass is really all that matters... the rest is just a minor hedge in case someone tries to tank you.
---
While I'm glad there are new Sansha SKINs, I'm not so sure about the dueling banjos sound effects that accompany them.
---
New Eden is a dangerous place, especially solo. Good job getting out into nullsec and experiencing it first hand!
---
You forgot to fit a Higgs rig.
---
Also I prefer to have a 50mn MWD in addition to the 100mn, because it lets you accellerate towards the hole a bit faster.
---
And you're fitting frigate-sized shield extenders to a cruiser which is pretty pointless. 
---
Maybe put a cap injector in the mids. You won't often need it but sometimes it might make sense.
---
Maybe change the shield power relays for nanos, too.
---
Yes it is. Its a sandbox, remember?
---
Especially when the 5 assault frigates run from every other ship that isn't a PVE fit VNI.
---
You don't want to fight when you roam. You want to 5v1 krabs.
---
Stop kidding yourself.
---
In this case its more like "My enemy's enemy is a problem for later.  For now, they might be useful to us."
---
Once you get through the HED-GP &gt; V3 pipe you should be fine. It's the low sec &gt; null sec connections that are camped.
---
You many have more luck going through Jamunda or just use a wormhole if you can find one. Always avoid HED-GP to get into null sec.
---
incase you have not seen the animation for them on sisi the red lines pulsate
---
You need a medium anchor rigs, a 500MN MWD, and only 3 zero-point mass is enought to make you light like a pod.
---
Large Microwarp drive is the most needed, it increase the mass over 100kt with the anchor rig
---
Yep, and it will force a 2 week cooldown when the structure is popped
---
WTB Baguette launcher
---
This guy gets it.
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
So just join some other blob alliance? Lmao that takes zero effort.
---
Lots of wars have already dropped, which means a lot of groups won't be there.
---
My corp isn't going to dec them for this kill because we want our 2 week immunity, not some shitty structure kill. CCP don't understand what the defender wants to achieve with this system because, as usual, they don't play their own game.
---
Can't wait for the wardec iteration in 2 years.
---
To draw a false equivalence with a racial slur.
---
It will grab attention, that's the point really.
---
It s this stuff that has drill the hole between "elite" alliance and krabing alliance and fuck the balance between the 2 players models.
---
Irrelevant in game but not on twitter I guess.
---
The only time the Titan gets dropped is when we try to fight.  Why would we not run from the boson that ends the roam immediately?
---
that's exactly what happened.
---
If you instablap a ship with Tornado's, the pod will most likely not be pre-aligned out as the pilot will need a second or 2 to get past the "wtf just happened" stage.
---
A meme so nice you post it thrice

Curse and anything.

Or, as mentioned before, loki&amp;loki.

Don’t resist

Not the only one having this issue at the moment  it seems...
---
This guys knows how to have fun in Eve. Great attitude and great fight!
---
i buy all stuff via steam, never had any trouble, sometimes a delay, but never more than 10 minutes. The starter pack contains 250.000 skillpoints, a accelerator, some skins and clothes. Maybe you redeemed them already during log in, so try to search your assets, look if you have unallocated skillpoints. If realy nothing is there contact the support.
---
Wait...theres an exit
---
That's literally what humans did sice the time we barked at each other. Be the underdog of the alpha male and grow until u can stab him in the back and take his place. And is a good thing, if u succeded than u addapted and ur genes are worth, if u failed, u die.
---
Huge amounts of drama, unhappy people, rule breaking etc. This stuff just isn't going to work...
---
Thanks for proving the opposite is not necessarily true.
---
Just what we needed. Oh wait
---
Client literally won't let you log in on multiple alphas on the same IP (or an alpha while you are logged into an omega), and if you get around it CCP will ban you if they catch you. You can still multibox as many Omegas as you like though, as always
---
"Why are there opinions outside my own? This can't be right, can it?" -.-
---
I made sure that they weren't hiding anywhere. The skins are fairly easy to check for which was my first tip off. I just submitted a ticket a little while ago. I've read that buying stuff through steam is generally not a good idea though. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Isn't that like normal to get mad when trying to explain something to a dumbass and he's like "nope, no clue whatsoever"?
---
Well most of /r/Eve does not log in anyway...
---
Fat retard fuck seeking attention
---
I agree it is simple, and yet hundreds of PODS get killed outside of bubbles all the time. Sometimes people lag. Sometimes people lose their ship faster than they were expecting. Sometimes people have their overview set up incorrectly. My whole point is just that things happen and don't always go exactly as planned. That's kind of like the driving force of half the content in this game.
---
You dabbling in works of fiction now?
---
Right.  
---
And now?
---
muh super count!!!!
---
U may blue goons, but they may not blue u.
---
i see it from a different ankle, for me null sec is the problem. A huge amount of star systems in eve are in null, and some alliances realy dont want anyone in their sov, smartbomb gatecamps all day, and therefore deciline a lot of the actual explorable, playable systems, shorten the experience 4 most players to high and low sec. Thats eve, for almost a decade now, thanks to goons 😁
---
What do you think antimatter is made from ? Only the best baguette of the cluster can use the oven-fresh taste and heat into antimatter.
---
WOOOO!!! I love the Phantasm, but the two skins are disappointing. This excites me :D
---
&gt; We need fighter in front of us
---
So you want people that just suicide ships because it won't make a difference with the current state of the game just so you can soil yourself in front of a (((((deserved))))) killboard? :thinking:
---
Who in their right independent mind thinks the game needs less people right now?
---
You can do the solo spawns easily in a vindi but the conduits have rats spawning 50k away.
---
There's no lose with asset safety.
---
Doomchinchilla loved to pvp. He was a very active player. 
---
Always liked him because of that, even if we were shooting each other on a daily basis during the last provi invasion.
---
Shame to see him go.  :-/
---
like the shity tea in a can?
---
No it wasn't
---
The sad part is given how proactive the art department at CCP is, this request may well be actioned well in advance of anything else.
---
Yeah, if you dont have the beacons set to visible on your overview, youd never even know they were there.
---
Those countries might want to consider stricter recruiting policies, at least a thorough API check.
---
Nobody ran those since rewards were so useless.
---
Ore anoms are the main issue, the other ones have had a rework already, but nothing much for ore ones
---
might be a fun social event. grab a knife, jump into the kitchen sink. talk some shit in fleet with dudes from all around eve
---
But...has he heard about the Rorqual changes?
---
Thanks. Has the Loki been a consistantly good ship or did it recently get buffed? It seems way more popular than the other three T3C.
---
Err pods have (effectively) unlimited inertia and always insta warp. Also when your ship is destroyed you always appear in pod at 0ms.
---
Heresy. Someone send her an Eve referal link ASAP.
---
My thoughts exactly.  When i logged in yesterday during US PST primetime there were just over 17k online.
---
Thank you :)
---
You can use a 100mn ab or a 500mn mwd they add the same mass.
---
Hope you get your stuff soon, if not a quick refund, and hope you enjoy eve for a long time, despite that inital experience, fly safe o7
---
MWD or AB have the same effect on your mass.
---
No it will not.
---
Its a trillby dammit.

There are also more countries than significant coalitions in Eve (or even alliances). I'd say the wars/group is bigger for Eve.

---
I disagree about them respawning at downtime as that clearly favours certain timezones, but just a hard limit on the number of anoms in a system at a time I'd be ok with. There's no doubt indirect consequences that I'm not thinking of but having groups have to spread out rather than building tall would undoubtedly lead to more conflict and less blue donuts.
---
At the minute there is no reason to want to directly control more space, and that is an issue. There needs to be drivers for war or this game will just end up with everyone being blue to everyone

They dropped the wardec and it ends before timer is reached. So not quite there yet.

yeah it is a product that needs to be sold but its also CCP's only real asset and their only real asset also needs to be protected.

Imagine you're a car company that has a reputation for making some really good cars that everyone liked, e.g. Toyota. Then some 900IQ genius at Toyota realizes that they can make 50% more profit if they lower the quality of their cars (and maybe sell their company to a bigger company and inflate the value due to this sudden bump in value), it will take a few years before the effect of that decision on sales and their reputation will actually make a difference, but it will happen and people will realize their product is crap and will stop buying it.

There are NPC stations with a jump clone service inside of Jita, doesn't need to be a freeport. There are just no jump clone services inside the main Jita 4-4 station.

You are just repeating what some spodbrain morron was sperging. If you look at BOT renters they usually have 1 or 2 maybe 3 guys per system. I dare to think ccp can figure out an algorithm that fucks the carebears who are packed 30+ per system more than the lone renter. That simple moving umbrella idea is pretty hilarious too. Go tell your fax pilots who just logged in to derp around on comms for 2 hours to move from fountain to delve to save greedy mongos in hyperspatial dda nyxes.

In "new" Eve, it's not just about the profitability but what is actually entertaining.

Invasions are much less "solved" (as they are just now for the first time fully playable), and they up to now, do not pay out that much.

Almost like this was mentioned 4 months ago in the feedback thread  [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/devblog-war-war-sometimes-changes/142879/16](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/devblog-war-war-sometimes-changes/142879/16)  guess CCP dont look at feedback that might make them do work to change what they already have laid out.

Its like the feedback threads are there just for show D:

Ironic thing is, while we call each other stupid and brainwashed, they're far from it.  Everyone has their own narrative and the experienced players easily recognize it; it's motivational.   Neutrals or HS players not involved in the politics day to day buy into the narratives and carry it close with them, it's manipulative.  Eve is sociological, it's about the players.  The spaceships  are secondary.   My perception of PL has been and will be as mercenaries willing to shoot, evict, back stab, spy or undermine any group in game and they were paid to do so.  It's a very "Eve" story.  PL was a lot of things and elitist shitlers were one of them.  I'd suggest whomever is on top has more or less "shitler" and again, that's also a very "Eve" thing.

Fuck Pirat - bunch of wankers, preying on the little guys.
---
Wormhole space pvp is pretty good right now, I don't think allowing caps to move around easily is a good idea because Eve really shines when it's subcap warfare with small-medium sized fleets.
---
This will also just allow nullseccers to invade wormhole with much bigger numbers and easily evict them.
---
Or the defense declares it mutual then once the structure is destroyed cancels the war.

Hi Jen o/

Big fan of your attitude Andy, you deserve way more viewers
---
Thank you for responding, but I don't think you get what I am trying to accomplish. I want to swap my training clone with a empty clone without incurring a timer. I can only do that in a Citadel.
---
I do it all the time with my noob alt in a Horde (unironically, not a spai) when join standing fleet in BWF. When I am ready to log off, I swap back. Can I do this at a freeport citadel near jita, so my main can stop spend 50m a clone for when I die do to my own incompetence? I died in a T3 with a non-blinged Sac the other day because i took too long to loot the first two rooms. I don't mind the lose, just trying to make it cost less...
---
&gt; yeah sov null is only good income if you multibox rorqs or run a bot farm, if you actually want to make decent income as a human player you should 100% own a C6, run L5s, farm burners, blitz FW L4s etc, if you're unironically running VNIs in nullsec using your human brain and human eyes you're working for less than the vietnamese kid who made your socks

This bot sooo unironically  .... really sad

horrific idea.

we dont need any help finding the pvp groups. Thats why we live in 5-5s in the first place. Those mechanics do some of the heavy lifting.

Shame on you OP for clickbait Art Team requests

Was looking forward to watching this as i like Lasker Emanuel vids.
---
Left a bit dissapointed, 10/10 for doing it but 3/10 for application in my view (you should have killed double the ammount you did, target selection was very poor, no idea why you was using anc. rep first, when you was you overloaded it without needing too, never tried repairing it when your tank was not under pressure, i could go on and on).
---
Sorry but if you gonna fly the best HAW dread, film it &amp; post the video i think you need to fly it better tbh.

Good thing was it made you smile, keep having fun.

There was a t3c rebalance (I think about year and a half ago maybe a bit more) when loki became the better t3c. Before that, tengu was the king for solo pvp t3c of choice.

---
Well killing afk VNIs is not rly pvp...
---
Killing krabs is pvk.
---
Only if the krab becomes an objective cause some 1 is defending it, it escalates to a fight between players. 
---
Killing something that can’t rly defend itself is no pvp for most players.
---
Well maybe you shouldn't smack yourself in the head with a solid sugar hammer.
---
You could but it's risky since it means your actual targets can finish it more easily.
---
I dunno man, I'd rather krab for 50mil or whatever wars cost these days then have to rf my own astra every week with subcaps
---
I think the trading citadels in perimeter are freeports, though I don't know if they have a jump clone service available, so you'd have to check yourself (sorry :( )
---
Nah, Tigahawk is basically right, they go into New Eden Witness protection basically (unless you're nobody like me in which case you get to keep your original name wooooo)
---
about skill injector, yes, you can't consider a 2day old character in a rorqual/Titan/super is "healthy" that mean rorqual prolifération soo titan/super proliferation aswell they ruined their own game just for some money

no problem with that just don't make them buyeable with isk but RL money w\_w

Can confirm, still playing EVE (with some breaks here and there), still living in wormholes, still as bad as ever :D

https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004152745-Wars
---
&gt;A war will end if one of the following events occurs:
---
&gt; - The attackers did not pay the weekly bills for the war in time.
---
&gt; - A surrender offer is accepted.
---
&gt; - Either attacker or defender lose their war eligibility, unless it's a Mutual War
---
&gt; - The attacker's selected War HQ for the war is destroyed, unless it's a Mutual War
---
In particular the last point
---
The ships alignment before it explodes has no effect on the pods alignment once ejected
---
If you just dec miners and have your HQ be a reinforced fortizar, it's unlikely that they'll be able to contest that. If they happen to bring anything, you just stall them long enough for the fort to rep.
---
Its summer and after a big release, so there's a lot of people on holiday, and a lot of plans in the works that are too early to talk about publicly. Personally I've been working on some test automation, and helping out with the early stage of our next plans :)
---
Also, Fozzie and I will be talking about a few upcoming things at EVE North on Saturday!
---
It takes like 2-3 afk algos to do that. You don't really have to do anything to make it happen.
---
that's after a 3 way split, and yeah you can probably get 4 or 5 sites an hour with that setup once you're comfortable.  I find it unlikely a guy who's brand new to C3s is going to make 3 times that in a rattlesnake though.
---
Thanks for linking! Was on mobile when I posted.
---
It's fine will maybe split up alliances and coaltions and generate more content, fun for everyone.
---
\*was
---
I feel like we're quibbling over details here. A year ago if you decked a mining corp, they were fucked full stop. Zero way to end the war or fight back. Now you're required to have a structure, and even if THEY can't fight you, they can pay someone to go fight you.
---

Would you mind sharing what makes to Loki better than the Tengu? Ty
---
Building an empire FORCES you in current mechanics to mine the shit out of the cluster with (ideally multiboxed) Rorquals. If not from time to time these pesky PvP-Neckbeards would pop out of WHs, you could finally fully afk that task. And as it is such challenging and emergent gameplay a lot of your mates do this already, then lose stuff to hunters and start insulting them on reddit. I opposition the people that were forced in 2017 to start mining again ( I mined the last time in 2009 and extracted all mining skills when PvP Meta was healthy around 2013/14) consider quitting the game, either they did already (see &gt;50% decline in real players since 2013) or they just hang around because of their old friends, sunk-cost-fallacy and for having a space-nerd-themed "Chat-Tool".

Everything. The only aspect in which they are somewhat close is tank. And that’s just for common stats before you start considering the long web on the loki.

Part of another comment I made:
---
**Reduced Resources -**
---
* Remove Null Sec Infinite Anoms Entirely
---
* Make Moons spawn Null and Low Sec Minerals ( maybe a smattering of high sec but very low?)
---
* Reduce Infinite Ratting Anoms in Null
---
* Low Sec would have a low amount of Null Minerals and an abundance of the mid minerals
---
* High sec should return to only the high sec minerals even on the moons and maybe a low amount of the mid minerals
---
* Remove the Triglavian mining anoms or make them a separate ore entirely (These were completely unnecessary and add even more minerals and now even morphite to high sec, this is ridiculous.)
---
* Leave Wormhole resources alone.
---
* Increased cost of Asset Safety Movement by like 10% (ust in general needs more isk sink).
---
It's an Anti-AT Field. Trigs are using false Xenuria's to turn super radiant scattering into a damage type. Nothing to see here...
---
What is the isk/hr is all I care? :)
---
That is very true. Now you at least can do something, but I was talking about how you can make it even more cancerous than back then because then infinite wars would cost 100m + the structure, compared to the weekly fee in the past.
---
How should I know? I have been trying to help the Triglavians not kill them.
---
Years ago manifest told me he had a character in brave when we were chatting at e3.
---
Funny enough I used that to test each factions caps I wanted to train and decided to go with amarr since the archon was just so sexy.
---
Its not that high anymore. When abyssals were still relatively new and mutaplasmids, skillbooks, etc. were more expensive it was in that region. It has now settled to about 400-500 mil/hr after filament cost.
---
You are not allowed to have fun in EVE.

Nice one

Or that the game of supercap N+1 is inherently uninteresting.
---
You are asking when they shit all over people with super and titan supremacy? That's the MO until they couldn't. Now that they can't, game is dying turn off server.
---

Does data and relic sites affect adms?

Are you pvping in low sec or null sec?
---
War decs are not the most fun and immersive pvp experience out there. This is taste ofcourse but there are not many who enjoy this kind of pvp. Far more (more fun) content to be had in low and null.
---
That said there are a lot of combo’s for two cruiser hulls that work nicely. One thing to consider tho is that recons are rightfully considered very dangerous and therefor might discourage people to engage you. The same goes for two t3cs, especially two lokis. You might find way more and fun engagements in two standard fit omen navys ( https://zkillboard.com/kill/77371271/ ) or osprey navys ( https://zkillboard.com/kill/73199190/ ) because people think they can have easy frags.
---
A good single boxed ceptor (something like https://zkillboard.com/kill/77385441/ ) + a dps cruiser is amazing fun as well. 
---
Good luck!
---
Well he's not wrong
---
Many faction and pirate cruisers offer great power for a low price. The ashimmu is very cheap right now, and it can preform the role of the curse, albeit not as well.  There are great kiting ships such as the nomen, nosprey, and fleet scythe. Augror navy is also a very tank brawler. If you’re looking for t1 ships, the caracal and thorax are ok. 
---
PS- I know this post is about cruisers, but I have to recommend the hull tanked brawler Brutix, as it is by far the most fun ship I have flown.
---
No, shows how much you don't know. It was the time after Phoebe Patch (2013, jump ranges) and Tiericide Patches that sadly stopped with Phoebe.
---
Im gonna take a wild gander here and blame CCP for whatever the question is

Was in horde years ago, was actually great fun.

Ouch.

The game would be fun again?

Pretty sure medium shield extenders are not designed for frigates...Not saying they can't be fit to a frigate either.
---
I still miss sitting on my virtual couch watching tv in stations.
---
That was a rather nice bit of fun watching the bait rush into the trap, thinking it was the other way around wasn't it?
---
Yeah, that’s what I’m asking. When *exactly* was there not a bigger fish and they shit all over people with super and titan supremacy? I don’t think it’s anything more recent than 6 years ago and if that’s the timeframe of “recent” then you have a horribly skewed outlook on the game 
---
What I’m really curious about is whether there’s a point in time you can identify where there wasn’t a larger group doing much the same thing.
---
Did The Mittani ever pull a Seth Rich? I don't think so...
---
I'll be there

Doom is a sleazy fuck and I'm amazed he still had bridges left to burn. Few people can fall out of favor with the entire EVE playerbase that quickly.
---
Project Nova needs to be made.
---
Deleted!!!
---
pure gold
---
No, it wasn't the last 3 years. It was the 5-8 before that in the many iterations of bob, proxies and meat shields. It indeed wasn't recent, it however lasted long enough to become seen as the culture and dynamic. As for me going to pick a specific day and time? Nah, I'm good on that. This isn't one of those things that is in question. It simply is how they played the game and the result is people take joy in returning the favor, just like people will take joy in returning the favor to goons in the future for their game play today.
---
Those fits are god awful, but it should atleast be interesting to watch
---
Gigx was one of the last great nullsec content creators. Imagine banning people that still give a fuck about this game
---
Of course you can be pedantic and say that they also go on destroyers... but the point is that they're not cruiser modules and fitting them on a cruiser is a bad decision in almost every situation.
---
who was the co2 leader before gigx?
---
most of nullsec and wormhole space is empty. The exceptions are choke points, if you travel to null via hi-sec wormholes you can often pop out in entire regions of empty space to "explore".
---
Yeah, that’s about what I thought. lmfao
---
The other guy is the bad man!
---
its good, but not in scram/dualweb range XD
---
I've already notified the authorities.
---
If they make it mutual, won't they become aggressors?  Would Ivy need to designate their own wardec structure then?
---
smooth brain is my favorite insult for some reason. I just imagine a brain with a hand rubbing over it.
---
And yet I have a lossmail from 2008 with your name on it...
---
Nah just routed. You can't do substantial damage to it yet.
---
\#2 will never EVER pass as it defeats the whole purpose of AS. 
---
Players returning to EVE to find that everything they owned was blown up is an even worse mechanic than the old outposts. I'm against that for personal hangars as EVE is not a second job. However, I'm all for having the corp assets drop and even be locked up if the structure is in low-power state.
---
StainGuy, I think it’s time for you to retire from reddit.
---
Your posts are at an all time low.
---
High sec has infinite missions.
---
Aw man, i really liked the idea of Dust 514 despite the dumb name. But a console exclusive shooter was just such an awfull fit. It wasnt marketed well eanough to the kind of people who like console shooters and quite a lot of the people allready playing EVE probably didnt allready own a playstation.
---
It was just a baffling move, for something that could easily have been pretty damn good.
---
The GigX thing was kinda sad.
---
I don't blame CCP for banning him, but it showed how bad (or mad) the tribal community can be for celebrating a player being forced to leave the game, just because he was your 'enemy' in game. Same shit recently regarding Brisc/darkshines etc.
---
The issue is that nullsec should stay more profitable than highsec.
---
And highsec has infinite missions.
---
IT evicted PL from fountain and smashed some titans when it mattered, BL consistently beat PL, and Goons beat PL in two major wars and B-R in that time period. 
---
All PL steamrolled was the old NC with the help of DRF, AAA with the help of Tapi, and BRAVE who have been a running joke since their inception. 
---
Unless you mean flexing on like 2 dreads on a POS or something
---
You guys all have phones, right?
---
Yeah, some of the reality is that a lot of the people running the anoms aren't going to pvp with less anoms.
---
They are going to do highsec mission.
---
When is this?
---
Bee Man Bad
---
I do think the bitching is justified. It is a result of CCP ignoring us. We would likely be more "reasonable" if our concerns were heard.
---
I am getting sado-masochistic feelings ... i wanna laugh really bad about this and at the same time it feels like being tortured ....
---
Supers are cheap enough to lose though; I don't know if we're playing the same game but I've seen people gate camping in them. As for citadels, you can spam Astras, each of which require a fleet to form three times to actually deal with, for next to nothing.

Even a Fortizar is now perfectly affordable for a solo player.

You want the devoter because you can get the mass over 150m that will two shot a VL that has gone critical that you don’t know the mass left on in the worst case scenario, Higgs rig is required and I think 4 plates. 3 mass entangles get it down to 2m and yes I have gotten stuck (not a wh’er )
---
Also they are good for smalls if you have 3 guys with you
---
Don’t you know CCP blatantly shows favoritism for that time zone?! 
---
Like when they released the limited memorial skins and everyone that operates on a normal schedule in US TZ was fucked because they were all gonna before most of us were awake.
---
Nova is already dead.
---
I got bumped while we were aligning and it didn't warp with the rest of the titans, so I cancelled the warp and let it sit. My other titan was there, so I just blew shit up with that one instead of both.

Hello people of Reddit! 
---
I have recently moved back into Wormhole Space and I am looking into getting a simple, mostly passive, PI setup running. This comes with a problem for me though, as I am mostly a PvP pilot and fail to understand industry of any kind (even though I love my spreadsheets). Same goes for PI, I just fail to get the jist of it.
---
Now, onto my question, can any of you PI people give me a heads up on what to start out with (besides the skills), or even a simple setup? I have seen multiple guides online, but most of them raised even more questions than they answered or didn't expail things in too much detail.
---
(Even a link to a guide that goes into as much detail as possibile would be appreciated, I am sure there are some out there, but I seem to be incompetent of finding them.)
---
Thanks for the help in advance!
---
It can easily happen with the current meta. It just requires both sides choosing to take the fight. It's that simple. 
---
Don't need anything beyond two sides willing to commit. 
---
Thanks for the mansplaining. I forgot you were a wormholer for a minute, but that reminded me.
---
The way you say "dooooood" is so obnoxious
---
Forgive me for being skeptical about that :thinking:.
---
I just think titans &amp; supers should be T2 dreads &amp; carriers respectively so they are more likely to have a material bottleneck + no more BPOs for them.
---
100mn fits are dogshit, 500mn is leagues better and safer
---
the fit itself doesnt really matter, you can forego the tank completely for more mass thingies, as long as you have a faction cloak, a 500mn, a cap booster of some sort and a higgs you're fine

tbh I don't even know why the dec'ing corp gets to set a different HQ for each war. that seems ripe for abuse.   
---
why not make it a single war HQ for the corp period and if it gets destroyed, they drop all wars and can't designate a new HQ for 2 weeks (thus not being able to declare new wars on anyone)  
---
I'm all for high sec wars, but if you can't be f\*\*ked to defend your stuff, or you pick a fight you can't handle, you should feel real loss for that and a single astra being destroyed isn't real loss.
---
People are answering your question how I would so heres another idea.
---
Dont go expencive go cheap someone said ashimu faction and pirate cruisers are way cheaper and almost jist as good in most cases as their t2 counter parts for half the cost.
---
I would say ash and vigilant or gila or something. Will do the same as a recon and hac but again half the cost.
---
T2 ships are expencive use them cautiously unless you jist pay for isk then do w/e you want.
---
I've been searching for old D2 videos. Do you have a link to that MC vs D2 vid?
---
keepstars and titan mains were a fucking mistake
---
Whilst I agree with you on limiting skill injectors and either removing Excavators or switching them to fighter mechanics so they're less able to be multiboxed... I'm not even sure that it would help at this point because the supercapital proliferation which alliances like yours and mine have benefited from would still exist, and it'd only be pulling the drawbridge up even harder on more entities trying to come into nullsec who didn't amass that wealth during the gold rush. 
---
Ultimately, only wholescale change which forces alliances to either get smaller or spread out more -- like ending endlessly spawning ratting and mining sites -- will allow risk to really be introduced into the game again, as the titans and supers are forced to either spread thinner (risking a concentrated enemy capital force ambushing them) or leave vast regions of krabbing lands undefended (meaning whalers can get more content).
---
As for TZ tanking, completely agree: it's cancer. All timers should be set to the timezone in which most points are accrued towards ADMs by the holder of the sovereignty, so if your ratters and miners are more active in EUTZ, we can assume your alliance is EUTZ, and your alliance's timers are in EUTZ.
---
its because feedback threads are waaaayyy too late in the dev cycle to actually garner meaningful change. by the time something hits SISI, anything more than a minor change is going to require pulling the feature entirely

Could the issue be Eve somehow corrupting my network adapter driver software?
---
Tribalism has gotten worse over the last few years. People join the game, are shuttled off to one of the 3 big new guy alliances, and stay in that group's sphere forever. People in your group are the good guys, and people not in it are the bad guys.
---
This. If anyone thought it was bad before, it isn't going to get better now.

Doesn't work. Mutual wars need no war hq's. Shit is broken.

Alright dude, hope you figure it out, when you ask for help for what I’m guessing is a adapter issue and proceed to question every steep I try to have you do it kinda rubs me the wrong way.

The CCP quote from CSM 12 summit II isnt a citation to you? What the fuck do you want?
---
&gt;Because different players aren't affected by others activation delays.
---
So how do you escape the first 5 min delay by having more players?
---
&gt;So is your issue what people can do with the isk or the amount of isk they have? You're getting very confusing.
---
What do you think "isk fountain" means?
---
&gt;Well, they do ban bots.
---
Yeah, like 10% of them.
---
&gt;Do you think that getting rid of all the bots is worth getting rid of real players too? Or that all bots should be eliminated up to standards that would affect real players and no further? Somewhere in between?
---
You have to take into consideration that CCP is apparently unable to detect a bot that runs 23/7 for months. There is a ton of low hanging fruit.
---
I think that deserves an applause.
---
I'm not convinced they're not the same thing.
---
&gt; It just requires both sides choosing to take the fight.
---
I would remind you of that as soon as your enemies would outnumber you the way you outnumber your enemies atm. If you are really serious about this point, sorry, then you are either limited in understanding or you take your RL job of lobbying for a thing even if you know its not to the benefit of the majority to serious.
---
&gt; I forgot you were a wormholer for a minute, but that reminded me.
---
Nope wrong, I am in SNUFF, and I hate how the last 2 years literally bulldozered Lowsec. Before that I lived in Nullsec in the time when it was possible to make an impact with a group where you actually know and like all people and it wasn't necessary to pile up to over 100k players with Test together. A Blob where you barely KNOW 0,5% of the players and your only relevance is F1(n+1) if you are not a stratop FC and if you are not a guy trying to feed of his RL job to get relevance ingame ...
---
So Brave outlasted Doom. Shall we pretend to be shocked.
---
I'm not trying to be pedantic. For new players it's not always obvious and small shield extenders are still useful and common on frigates. I just don't want  a new player confused by stating meduim shield extenders are for frigates...
---
Dust was how I was introduced to the Eve universe. Compared to other FPS games out at the time it felt 15 years behind the curve. The bombardments from above felt a bit gimmicky, but still an interesting concept. The gun play was clunky and skill progression felt half baked.
---
I don’t see how it being on PC would have magically fixed these issues.
---
I found this one [d2 v mc](https://youtu.be/_L0ZUD25QdY)

Yes but here's the thing. If they attack 20 groups, each group checks those conditions. If only 1 group has a mutual war, the only one which doesnt drop is the mutual war.

The problem with osmium was always the crazy min / max fits getting max upvotes.

Remember the strength of the old SHC forums in its glory days was the intelligent but abrasive conversation that used to take place in those threads.

I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying. I'm saying you're overcomplicating it. This is a game. There's a time to just go "YOLO" and have some fun. 
---
And hey, I'll take relevance for any reason over whatever it is you are.
---
Depends on how good their computer/connection is. I’ve lost pods because despite spamming warp because my computer didn’t realize I was in space until it was too late.
---
10 years playing EVE and still learning something new.  I was taught wrong then when I first started learning to PVP 9 years ago.  They told me align out before you die or lose your pod.  Never doubted it because I seemed to lose less pods doing it that way.  Must've just been because I was spamming the warp button.
---
can someone confirm this??
---
you could play chess in eve via trade window. but not sure if   other person can see the item being moved around on other side of window

Oh, I definitely will make a official post once the program actually has some proper useful functionality (which will be very soon, I just got station order pulling working and just need to add a few finishing touches and I'll have market order updating working and market analysis working)
---
For the entire existence of Eve Online CCP has had a strong group who thought the game would fail at any moment, so the economist answer was to spend resources trying to diversify their product portfolio. Imagine if those resources were spent on Eve Online.

Oh summer child...

---
Slightly unrelated to everything, but I think one of the biggest mistakes PL ever did for the state of the game was beating Brave Newbies to the point of no return until they gave up and disbanded. The game just wasn't the same for new players anymore after BNI was gone.
---
The other 19 wars in your example have already ended before the structure is destroyable, as they would have without this one mutual war. Those 19 get redecced as soon as possible, with another HQ designated, or with the same HQ when/if it repairs.
---
The one group that declared a mutual war is now stuck in a mutual war that does not end when the value-less structure is destroyed.

**CCP:** Let the pvp players pvp themselves, we will work on other games rather than address existing issues. Pve players don't matter

EVE autochess. If they make it within the next few months. they could have something.

But medium shield extenders *are* for frigates. Sure, small shield extenders are useful too, even if they're pretty niche. That doesn't mean that medium shield extenders aren't for frigates. 
---
If they aren't for frigates what else are they for? They're a waste of a slot on cruisers.

Seems to affect the frequency of your posting far more than the quality.

&gt; We take outnumbered fights all the time.

Here you mix actual "wars" with casual roams from pando &amp; dark. thats 2 different things. And this works because your roams hit the critical mass of a full fleet. That does not counter the point that stuff like we did for more than half a decade is simply not possible anymore for multiple reasons. The alternative for us is to join the blob playstyle we never wanted and start skilling mining with over 200 Mio SP (that I extracted for a reason in 2013). That results in people leaving the game (50% since 2013 you can't deny) and if skill urselfs example finds followers, it will be less than 2 years you find yourself with the Serenity Server conditions 90% of Delve population would love (because they are too shortsighted to see the implications to themselves)
---
Goons and NC both always had larger super fleet, why do you think PL was hesitant to use them in larger battles?
---
Also lol at you trying to claim a 2000 man alliance was the largest entity in game. What an asshole.
---
Huh?
---
What's stopping me? Jump fatigue. Once upon a time I was flying with Black Legion and we used to move stuff from the other side of the universe just to get great fights. Now it's impossible to do anything even remotely close to what you were able to do back then. Also think that citadels just fucked the game completely for everyone but farmers, and there's no going back. It's not up to me to force myself to enjoy something that I don't, it's up to CCP to make sure people enjoy what you can do in the game, so their game stays alive.
---
Why, wasn't being a bitch, if he can match piloting skill with his enthusiasm he'll be one hell of a pilot

Top quality game mechanics!
---
Almost seems like the devs don't even play EVE anymore.
---
Know whats in common with Dimmortal and Eve Echoes?
---
Both are developed by the same company for the same market.
---
Which are not all that profitable all things considered. Highest you can make is around 90m ISK/hr by blitzing them in a Machariel worth 800m+. Anything else is around 60m/hr and you're still probably doing it in a Rattlesnake worth a similar price as the Machariel. 
---
By the point that you can blitz missions in a Machariel, there are so many more things that you can do that are so much more profitable, even in hisec (ie: incursions). Wormhole space has a better isk/hr for more risk, most null activities are also more profitable than this. VNI might be 60m/hr, but you're also doing it in a fit worth a fraction the price of the Machariel, with also a fraction of the required skills.
---
So, because you keep referencing a 2000 man alliance that automatically means that everyone with a working memory of one group with double to triple the capital and super capital force than everyone else should just experience amnesia? You can choose any arbitrary number you want and it doesn't change that they as a coalition used and possessed and absolutely enjoyed the dick swing of having that force. Just as the south is now. Name calling may earn you brownie points with the peanut gallery, however you are a sharp enough fellow to know when shit tall doesn't slant the details far enough to obscure fact.
---
the simplest setup is to produce P2 on each planet. search "P0 to P2"  
---
very low maintenance but the ISK isn't awsome.  
---
 I have a medium setup : 17 planet produces 4 types of P1, 3 planet P1 to P2
---
Some of your points are spot on, but I disagree on walking in stations/incarna as a most commonly requested feature.
---
I'm glad it's gone because I felt it represented a deviation from the elements of the game that brought (my guess) a majority of the players to the game in the first place.  I believed that spaceships and all the cool things about life in space were a big driver to a lot of players.  An unknown % of the population might feel that walking in stations would be a good EXTRA feature, but CCP should never have developed that feature at the expense of the core component of the gameplay that brought many of us together in the first place as a space based MMO.
---
CCP's attempt was going to be held up for comparison against other games where the core gameplay was based around walking avatars, and so dedicating all the dev resources and time for those games was expected and necessary to make their core gameplay work.  Against that focused competition, CCP's efforts were always going to come up short.... and they did in spectacular fashion.
---
They are useful on frigates, jump dessies, command dessies, destroyers and even some cruisers too( but that is dependant on fit,cap,cpu and circumstances). Anyhow, I'm not looking to debate and argue...sorry if my comment upset or offended you.
---
And in your example for the fit above, I couldn't agree more that mediums should not have been used.
---
https://i.imgur.com/82OOnZ6.jpg
---
Which are only as profitable as VNI ratting if you have a fit worth an order of magnitude more than a VNI.
---
Scrapmetal Reprocessing is the skill to melt your loot at a higher efficiency.
---

havent PGL already been gone for while now? atleast he doesnt fc fleets
---
It's not like they let us enjoy the war. The Karpinski Labs fight. That was it. They didn't defend the structure in Piak, resulting in what OP is talking about.
---
Since they're probably multiboxing, I don't know if they even can muster a decent structure defense.
---
Most mouth-breathing horde members don't know the meaning of "don't go in alone." Its pretty hilarious when a dread arrives and the feed continues, just like the last feed. Always fun. Please welp more.

Horde generally welcomes anybody to come play, except for that really, REALLY annoying WEE WOO goon. Goons should drop kick that idiot, if they haven't already.
---
&gt;  If ore and ice belts only respawned at downtime and only X havens/whatever spawned per day, it would force large alliances to spread out more. Super umbrellas would become more efficient and rorqual ore production would have a bottleneck that isn't just the number of rorquals you can put in a belt. 
---
For combat sites it might have that effect, but it will have no impact on mining. mining anoms is just a small part of the total ore available in a region
---
It's a super old game with an extreme learning curve.  No one is surprised membership is declining.  I'm surprised that it is still going relatively strong.
---
And one of their favorite targets, Ivy League/E-Uni wouldn't have nearly as much trouble pushing on it.
---
I think that was a Phish show
---
If you're planning to use the Sacrilege and Curse eventually, you could try their T1 versions for kicks; the Maller and Arbitrator.
---
Generally you want a pair of ships that compliment eachother; so if you have a tanked brawler, then the support ship can be something designed to disable the opponent (neut/damp/ecm etc) while also supplementing the DPS.
---
Or, alternatively, you could go two heavy DPS ships with respectable tanks, with the objective being to break any target before it can cause you significant damage.
---
Not to my knowledge, but their corresponding upgrades in iHubs are ADM dependent however.
---
Military index is boosted simply by killing pirate vessels though; if there are any rats in those sites and you kill them, that will have a minor positive impact on the ADM.
---
As far as I'm aware, theyre still making it, thry just have to retool a lot of it
---
Scrapmetal reprocessing is indeed the skill you want to use for reprocessing modules, useless ammunition and other gear from your mission results.
---
After that, I suggest you look at the [Eve Uni Manufacturing](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Manufacturing) page for the basics of production, and what skills need to be trained for that.
---
An important note: Blueprints can be researched to increase their "Material Efficiency" (reduces input materials needed for same output) and "Production Efficiency" (reduces time to produce the same output). If you don't want to train the myriad researching skills yourself, you'll need to buy a pre-researched Blueprint Original off contracts.

i know what you mean, i play E:D aswell from tim to time 🤣
---
Some new "big" PvE content which will work exactly like all the other PvE content, just with menacingly red ships this time.
---
Don't worry about it.
---
&gt;It was just a baffling move, for something that could easily have been pretty damn good if they had made it available on PC as well.
---
They could've made an Eve Online shooter in gary's mod and it would be a cash cow for a decade. 
---
What I don't understand is how the hell CCP can go "You know we have some of the most highly educated, most grown-up customers in the entire gaming industry, and they all use PCs, so lets make something NOT FOR PC, with game mechanics that won't challenge an orangutan". 
---
&gt; Seems like every single promising spinoff project they have taken on has been sunk by a vocal minority that gets pissy every time they try something new 
---
Every project they've made has been sunk because either: 
---
* I can not play it on my PC. 
---
* It does not interest me because its not a sci-fi MMO with space battles (nor a 4X game which is my primary other game genre). 
---
* Mix of the two. 
---
CCP has ZERO customer basis outside of the Eve Online genre. If they made a new Eve Online game they'd have immediate customer basis in their existing customers. But everywhere else in all other genres of game they're "the new guy", no more trustworthy than a traveling salesman that just came to town. 
---
So the question is, why haven't CCP made Eve 2.0 yet? Like, start from scratch with code, now with commentary on the code, and then never add stuff that we hate (remote repairs and fozziesov, lets say). And scale ship inputs properly relative to mining output. And maybe rebalance the SP (or remove it entirely), because I think it would be healthy for the game if a titan cost 180bn or so with no SP requirements, and a dread cost maybe 5bn and every pilot could use one without any SP training (and no Faxes exist obvs). A battleship maybe close to 800M and no SP cost. Rorqual 20bn (incl drones) and no SP cost (and no faxes to save it remember).
---
"Haha the guy who represents me tried to get a guy to kill himself"
---
It wouldn't have, but the whole idea was that Dust was another thing you could do with your territory and resoueces. like PI but an FPS. 
---
Having it on console only breaks the Eve player that wants to sit in a battleship in orbit while Dusting
---
Make sure to account for volume.
---
Because it isn't, not to put too fine a point on it.
---
Are you retarded?
---
This is a pretty dumb post considering plenty of people do "true solo" PvP.
---
I like to use the tools at my disposal, personally. I think anyone who goes out and roams and starts fights is useful for the game as a whole.
---
Oh, our bad it was us. Doing the bad touch on your structures.
---
good, you should respect your last enemy
---
I can't remember when, but someone from CCP said on a TIS episode like a year ago or less that resource wars is one of those features they decided isn't going to work and it'll be abandoned and or removed at some point. I'm probably blanking on some of the details but that is the gist of it.
---
meh when i used to take caps to horde they sent waves of newbies at me and no caps, then suddenly the big toys were coming out and the great content for newbies died fast
---
Who would even do this kind of "resource war" when the real resource war is won by multiboxing Rorquals with NEAR2/TACO/Super-Umbrella?
---
CCpls, add players.
---
Whoa whoa look at mister enlightened centrist over here haha both sides are dumb guys grab your popcorn
---
This is your daily reminder that Eve is dying.
---
Like you're mum conceiving you LOL chalk it
---
I hear it has warp strength of 20!
---
Move along..... nothing to see here!
---
The confusion is real if you're not expecting an instablap, you probably will need 2+ seconds to find some overview thing and warp to it. Whereas in a normal fight, you're spamming warp for the last 10% hull or whatever.
---
why would he, when there are much better games available than this retarded pve timesink simulator game
---
:retard:
---
Twitch.tv/bjornbee
---
So they should all undock their massively out numbered and outgunned force to die? Because that will keep people playing the game and surely keep Eve alive when they lose everything they've worked for to a mass blob with no way of winning...

---
Hey could have gotten Dust right first time of they released it on PC.
---
Wouldnt have magically fixed anything, but the game would have benefitted from a larger potential playerbase which in turn would have incetivised CCP to spend more time trying to improve upon the game rather than just giving up on it.
---
I see the incoming screeching "CCP favours party A over B, here I analyzed the zkill readouts, party A received 5% more NPC-damage" ... XD

I honestly don't give two fucks about the eve tribalism, it's why I'll not choose a flair, nor will I mindlessly "hate" another group in the game. You won't see me calling people "spodbrains" or "dinobrains" unironically. Bashing on my "enemy" just because the leadership of the alliance I just joined has them set red. Who knows, one day I might fly with them instead of shoot them. Why breed needless animosity between players over a video game? Because of pretend space pixels? Naw, I'm gonna blow them up (or get blown up) with a smile and thank them for the opportunity.
---
The only conflict sides that matter are the players vs CCP, we're all in the same blue donut together on that one.
---
The project management at ccp is world class bad.
---
You're literally arguing against automobiles by complaining that they're making your livery stable business obsolete.
---
Loool'd
---
When was the last time PL did went on campaign without NC?
---
Jesus do you people really eat spod as a dinner. I've been killing mining ships in a single bomber for so long. You can very easily solo VNIs in Orthrus/Stratios/Loki.
---
Instead of posting on reddit because you're bored at looking at your Gila drones, maybe go roaming. Also, 1 bad experience doesn't count
---
dUdE
---
So long that I remember, rats doesn’t spawn in Exploration sites, except the Rogue Drones ones.
---
This don’t take into accounts the strange combat signatures that still require some hacking in them, like the sites where one can get the Neurotoxin skillbooks.
---
If my worst trait is not wanting to continue a Reddit arguement, I’m sure I would be okay. Considering I was on command comms with DJ while the fleet was running and spoke with the dudes directly involved, I sure free move was left on. 
---
If you wanna dredge up my running for CSM into this, I’m sure you can agree there is a difference between debates on the council and r/eve.
---
I could see that if the other fleet had a high rep with the box faction
---
This game needs more lag!
---
  -no one ever until OP started typing.
---
Because Bots, that's why!
---
We (and I'm not a bloc player, mind you) used to undock to save krabs, but the most retarded roamers (namely Init) kinda killed that game by always killing a krab they hold the moment response lands.
---
What's the point of trying to save something when it ends up dying whether you form or not? 
---
That's why we kinda stopped doing it unless krab is in a capital. pvping where you live was stupid to begin with...
---
Small shield extenders? On a cruiser? Show me a fit where this makes sense and I'll eat my hat. 
---
I don't think I've ever fit a small extender to anything.
---
'dredge up' arnt you currently running but there is very little difference they are both cancers on this game
---
If you think so, well then have fun with 15k logged in accounts (representing 1k real people) in EU prime and 20 Bil PLEX subs in under 2 years. If this is what progress looks like for you well, then I really wasted time ...
---
Why would a 500MN be better?
---
The “run” as it matters, is over. Voting is already concluded anything beyond this point is out of my control. So yes, my run is over. I would to revist this topic next year though
---
You coulh have used the venture you get from the tutorial agents, it has a +2 resistance to warp disruption. With a proper fit its quite hard to catch for a newbie ship
---
Yeah exactly. 
---
Ive figured that i had enough lp on one of my heroes, got meself that comfy and stylish jacket, so i dont need that rw thing anymore
---
Too much spod
---
Yeah watching YouTube in captains quarters was great. Until CCP got mad and started banning people for modifying the client.
---
Yeah, because killing mining ships with a bomber IS PvP.
---

---
One should tell him that the fotm is "Join Goons, then tabbing out to Netflix" as NEAR2/TACO/Umbrella is keeping him 99% safe.
---
LoL, I see what you did there...
---
Oï ! Welcome to wormhole life (if you aren’t already part of it !)
---
"Hole control" can have multiple meaning depending on the entity using it. Generally, my definition is being able to roll every wormhole that isn’t your static, and still being able to watch your statics, and preventing warp with bubbles, and enough combat ships to kill whatever come through.
---
Concerning what you should bring in, it depends on your needs. Having multiple characters able to scan a way in (or out) is vital, as is having some rolling stuff as you said. Depending on your wormhole class, tinker Rattlesnake (look up the fits online), Nestor or maybe a Dreadnought pilot if you’re really in the highest classes (C5-C6, and a total knowledge of what you’re doing).
---
Another thing that might give you more ISK out of your home, but can become a logistic nightmare is doing PI with every character slots on each of your alts. You’ll be able to make billions with P4 each month, but be careful not to burn you out with all the management !
---
I can understand being misinformed  9 years ago by someone who had no idea how game mechanics work, but it's kinda impressive that you held onto that incorrect detail for such a long time, with posts semi regularly popping up explaining warp mechanics in detail.
---
Nah this nerd is NOT taking the pussy sad day 😔
---
Brace yourself, here comes the horde of people who never single-boxed their entire life, yet know everything about it to tell you that you are wrong.
---
To be fair there have been LOTs of tiny little groups that have been destroyed and ran out in this game. So IDK if this is necessarily true.
---
6 out of 9 current CSM are goons or goon pets.
---
Gullenecro will laugh if they have to pay 0.5% of the value to recover some random odds and ends stored in the war hq.
---
Because it's not that good.
---
True facts.
---
Just get gud! Solo is doable in eve! Even by scrubs like me.
---
If this mining ship and the bomber are both piloted by real players (the mining ship has a nice chance to be a beep-boop-bot), yes then it is per definition pvp (player versus player). As per definition of a single shard server this has NOT to be consensual.
---
pirat drops all the wars related to the piak war hq, and they expire before the final timer, meanining even if the structure dies, no wars will be invalidated by it, and pirat gets to continue business as usual just at the cost of a new structure
---
&gt;This is exactly the kind of content I had always hoped that a war headquarters structure would bring!
---
I feel like you forgot the /s there
---
I'm down, thanks for doing this
---
Do you even think before you post? It's like you're not even trying. The further they place it from Jita/Amarr, the further they place it from their own ships that they can defend it with.
---
thin skinned Icelandic plebs
---
I'm sorry my what now?
---
Nope. Wardecs dropped, structure saved. Even if someone else they're at war kills the structure, it wont invalidate any wars.
---
Good man, and if someone is living under a rock:  
---
[https://youtu.be/pqjVdPtB9lU](https://youtu.be/pqjVdPtB9lU)
---
Or just buy a brawling Hecate and run around killing everything you see, pretty much anything t1 cruiser and down you can take. I think I killed 10 ships last night with mine (7 were combat ships that tried to fight me, I wasn’t just murdering travelers with a bubble camp or something). If you want to hotdrop then you do need alts, but you don’t have to do that.

Eve is dead boys, log off event every monday now, there is no more fun in eve!!!1
---
Have you tried gitting gud?
---
In the words of Gevlon, it would do nothing.
---
In eve, there is no conflict between two 100-member groups for 100-member resource. They would just join up and kick the lower half, so 100 better players will get the resource, and 100 worse players would get nothing, without any conflict being even theoretically possible.
---
After the anoms buff, krab density increased really hard, which sorta fueled current state of "strength in numbers" nullsec. If you decrease krab density, nobody would spread out, they will just bleed players till the new krab density limit, and kicked krabs will move on to whoever haven't reached krab limit yet.
---
Overall I don't see it achieving much tbh. Whenever any activity in eve gets you most ISK/hr, chinese and russians farm the fuck out of it, reducing value of its rewards until something else is more profitable. Unless you nerf every activity at once, it'll even out eventually.
---
Happens quite literally all the time?  Pick one, NCdot and PL often pick separate fights on opposite ends of the universe.
---
**Counter Idea:** Anchorable structure (*like cyno inhib or something*) that calls in reinforcement aid from diamond rats and expires after 3-4 hours. Diamond rats will act normally and will escalate depending on threat level.
---
Correction: Init killed the krab and the response and the response fleet.
---
&gt;given the way EVE players behave, it's for the best.
---
I get that.
---
i think you are mistaking intended consequences for problems.
---
What are you talking about? Brave is better and stronger than ever. Plus we saw the formation of karma fleet and horde during the same time period.
---
Ok thanks for the heads up
---
Naw. Your super group has literally been considered as one entity in all military planning for a decade. It's no different than saying Condi or Bastion or Karma Fleet are going to both be on the field with their assets at the same time and it's planned for.
---
Yeah I'm a scrub and doing solo pvp just fine.  OP, maybe you should learn the environment you are fighting in and go somewhere else if it's not favorable.

You don’t like Suicide ganking?

why not just have scamming rats also activate a covert cyno?

Can someone please explain what the zero-point entangler does and how its used?

---
No negative impact you say ?
---
Of course it’ll have a bloody negative impact, tons in fact. Just the idea of powercreeped ships, strip miners and MLUs is very very bad, since it means more ore and raw materials on the market for basically no counterparts (and don’t tell me price will be a good enough barrier. The guy spinning his twenty Rorquals in nullsec will just say you the contrary).
---
We don’t need more materials on the market, or new ships in the game, and you’re literally asking to bring in more because of a failed mechanic from CCP. The fact that they simply didn’t wanted to invest more time in fixing it and making it interesting prove us they don’t care about Ressource Wars, like we don’t care about it too.
---
No. Just no. PvP means BOTH players are fighting each other. Meaning, they both CAN fight. Does not need to be a fair fight, but both players should be able to fight. A bomber shooting a defenseless mining ship with no guns is not PvP and will never be PvP.
---
Shitpost away youngin

Haha, yes I was. SKINS are the last thing this game needs right now.

---
Make the game less playable and make the people even more salty? Yeah, right...
---
New retards will step up
---
So.. when we have 1000 people on grid, we want to turn it into an opportunity to farm isk? Sounds like a plan.
---
Check their username. Pretty relevant
---
9 of 10 Miners are min-maxxing, so there is only 1 goal, finish that rorqual skills, join KARMA, make semi-afk-ISK on High-Moons.
---
That by the way also caused the most problems in market/prizes after Lifeblood. The rorqual-Miners did not even look at R8/R16 Moons, whose output before Lifeblood was mined as Collateral on Safe-POS, Reaction-POS, Prod-POS at least 90% if not more.
---
That R8/R16 harvest fell to nearly zero shortly after Lifeblood.
---
It is simple, people who measure their ingame success and fun only by income will not do stuff that lowers their possible income. 
---
So you will have to buff this at least to a level it can rival an R16+/R32.
---
Should allow for any and all types of mods to incentivize the amount of people fighting and looting.
---
Abyssal PVP ain’t the best and it’s TZ related, I agree.
---
But regular abyssal sites, and even more : frigate abyssal sites are great and far from failed.
---
You can almost always crash the wormhole on time with 500mn whereas 100mn is slow and easy to tackle and bump off.
---
Buffing mining subcaps wont have a huge impact with the prevalence or rorquals. As long as the mods effect mining lasers and not drones it won’t be a big deal
---
I'm crying just thinking about the 10s of millions they burned
---
Actual lol. I actually laughed out loud.
---
&gt;The real 'content' in this game is something with more thought put into it than 'take ansiblex and go small gang shooty'. 
---
Perhaps your content is massive set piece battles. Many other people enjoy the game in other ways. Everyone's content is different.
---
Well yeah, Hulk fleets that tag along Rorqual fleets will just be deadlier. But hey, I doubt this idea will come to the game anytime soon.
---
Tbf a procurer with combat drones can be dangerous for  solo bomber if you don't manage your range but yeah, it kinda is ganking rather than PvP. Looks the same on your zkill stats tho I suppose.

I'm really appreciating this strawman, however, let me know when you want to get back on topic. I'm really interested in hearing how making the new top tier ship in the game even more accessible and cheaper. Please, again, tell me how it will make the meta that much better despite making subs even more useless.

People like you have never understood the game EVE was for a long time. The advertisements even said, that pvp is non consensual, and EVE is a "dark harsh place". That mindset of you made EVE what it is now, a place where you multibox 10 Mining Capitals and can even do this tabbed out because its so safe ... this game is in the dumpster because of this "I just want to make ISK in peace, why do these bad people bully me" mindset. In fact people limiting PvE with PvP was an integral part of the economic meta. But that is fucked up today also (hello ISK inflation and PLEX prices)
---
The best part is not having to manually dock, or take abuse from the game for using a docking computer.
---
I am going to login all my accounts at this date and time just for the memes
---
need to have good standings with them too.
---
RIP USTZ isk.
---
Putting caps into low class is a pretty terrible idea
---
No they’re just doing what they’re best at - exploiting mechanics.
---
Hmm, you might have  a point there
---
Just like how Brave doesn't have supers and all our doctrine fits have salvagers.
---
I guess the last rorqual changes pushed him over the edge?
---
It's almost as if the art team works on completely different things compared to people who know how to code.
---
\*cough\*presidential tax return checks\*cough
---
Wait was anyone supposed to care? 🤔
---
Essentially the key to a nomad life is a capital alt. Reason being it’s 1,000,000 m3 ship maintenance bay in addition to a 10,000m3 fleet hangar.
---
You can store a few pvp ships and use it to move around multiple locations, the best being lowsec stations near null alliances that have less experienced players who you can engage in pvp with.
---
If you run out of ships, go back to jita, refuel your carrier or whatever cap, and move on to the next location. If a location doesnt work, beauty is you can move with all your ships in your capital so no need to move them one by one.
---
Hope this helps to some degree, nomadic life is a fun and really engaging one. Good luck.
---
Why not calculate cost to repair as proportionate to assets in the respective citadel and/or the number of players in the corp holding it, AND the size of said citadel? 
---
That way you could cause serious damage if you knew which citadel held what assets and shot at it. If you shot at a citadel holding some supers, it would cost quite a bit to rep back up. 
---
Also add to that the idea that it'll draw cash from an alliance wallet automatically, so you never know, maybe b-r 2 will happen.
---
Small guys would then proceed to harass big alliances by shooting their structures, inciting a fight. Come fight with us if you want to defend your structures. Wallet empty? structure doesnt get reinforced anymore. Go at it with a gang of frigs or destros so when the bastards hotdrop your corvette, you have a chance of running away.
---
I don't know, I don't even have confidence in the suggestion above, just basically rambling. I am however agreeing with the popular reddit opinion that things are stagnating and we need something exciting to happen...
---
You are going to cry when Eve finally dies. 😆
---
Or just get a T3C and hop in a wormhole

That depends. Did he know about them?

Have you tried to kill subcaps (not rats) recently with fighters or a HAW Titan? I am not talking about whelping a fleet straight into a boson.
---
Nah if you form as much as they have, they kill crab and run like pussies, then call for more pussies, and if they can form more than you, they come back to kill another krab, and if not, they stand down.
---
The title of the most retarded roamers is not granted for taking a gudfite you know.
---
So... they kill you, evade being killed by you.. and you are upset by this. Makes sense. Grr they are too good.
---
Invading Precursor Entities/ Triglavian Collective picked the most inconvenient systems to invade. They chose Alentene and several other systems in Verge Vendor.  Alentene is a transit hub next to the starting system Cistuvaert.  I feel bad for the new players trying to do missions in Verge Vendor now.  I can fly around in a capsule without  Triglavian Collective shooting at me.  But flying in a capsule is so slow.  I guess I'll just hang out in a quiet system if I can find one.  Maybe I'll go to Placid.  No wait, CODE. is in Stacmon now.  Ah.. the invaders ruined my weekend plans. lol
---
They're probably intimidated when they see 80% of pvp videos showing a "solo" fight, but seeing a person's ceptor alt or bifrost backpack alt. For veterans, its pretty easy to look past those and be like "eh, its nice, but not needed". But to newer players or people who've spent all their EVE time krabbing and are bored of it, looking to pvp, they feel like these things are necessary because all the videos they watch show the same thing.
---
I've always solo'd (no alts) and have been relatively successful with brawling/skirmishing. Just a lot of trial and error, good fitting knowledge, good ship knowledge and patience. All those things take time and to people who are impatient or intimidated to go the ol true solo route will claim alts are a necessity.
---
i did this for 5 month, packed all stuff into carriers, jumped around lowsec and Daytripped into Wormholes.
---
3 Toons, a cloaky hauler, 2 Nestors, 2 Tengus and some pvp ships.
---
Best Solo Time i had in Eve
---
Do you still play PK?
---
I'd say one dread account and one T3c (Tech 3 Cruiser) account.
---
T3c, especially Tengu, is good for solo c1/c2 and can be a bitch in low sec.
---
Dreadnought is good  because big ship maintenance and fleet hangar. Nag is good for DPSs and Moros is good for tanking.
---
Go to Sisi and do fits, learn fitting with sisi if you need injectors on sisi tell me I can get some
---
You're shit at this game if you think you need any of that. What you need is a better attitude.
---
It depends on perspective, they have the paying customers. What has dimished massively is the number of unique subscriptions.

Sorry I wasn’t trying to question you. Sorry if it came off that way! Very grateful for your help.

In any event, problem is SOLVED. 
---
Alienware laptops with Killer Wireless cards have a known issue (which did not show on a Google search because I was assuming it was Windows). I downloaded a new Killer wireless driver and the problem is resolved.
---
Basically, the official story is none of Bob knew the dev was a dev, but since the dev wanted Bob to win the war they were in he just snuck them a few extra t2 BPOs, mostly crappy ammo ones but also a Sabre. 
---
Of course, at the time a lot of people, especially the people fighting Bob, spun it as Bob having all sorts of help and collaborating with devs.
---
It's trickier now that they are not in the Agency...

---
Not sure honestly,  was hoping for viking funeral etc...
---
don't get me wrong, i'm all for it.  But it probably wouldn't make too much of a difference for ratting.  You'd have less people super ratting and more people using multiple VNI accounts spread over more systems.  So kinda good? 
---
for ore and ice, yes, the respawn rate should absolutely be nerfed to the ground.
---
No they don’t. They just use bullshit mechanics and feel no penalty.
---
Yeah, it's the button spamming that does it.
---
Its almost like you always plan for a worst case scenario right? Kinda like how right now anybody thats going to fight TEST assumes that Goons supers will be a part of that equation
---
Good riddance.
---
Yep, everything in eve revolves around goons bashing structures in null..
---
That's not an unwise calculation given the last year. What was that cute quote by Doom? Something about not wanting good fights but to burn TEST to the ground. I truly wonder where the animosity comes from.
---
Hah gottem
---
would be cool if it left a trace that you could follow to finish it off
---
That makes sense, yeah I very rarely use an alt when I roam, to be honest the extra energy needed to focus on 2 characters can often screw you over, especially if you are flying a nano kitey ship.
---
Ezpz - just come to Horde space.
---
I'd hit that
---
I'm just saying it was a mistake.   PL's declined can be traced back to his "leadership".  The leader than ran PL into the ground...
---
i actually never thought that PIRAT would actually fight back. I thought its normal to not show up for defense in eve.
---
eh no
---
That is, effectively, what CCP has been doing by delaying spawns.  They can tweak that number as they please to get this effect without having bad knock-on effects (like TZ issues).
---
A) the Jita riots worked because they were an unplanned reaction to events. This cannot possibly become that and using it as a leverage point shows desperation in your cause.
---
B) The riots also included 4k unsubs that week. 
---
C) The message those who shot the monument was "we would rather waste our ammo then play a game with gold bullets." What is the message here?
---
Curse is great, add any dps ship and you’re good.
---
I appreciate you saying that, using manufacturer drivers was one of my first suggestions and I’m glad it worked out for you.
---
**Counter Counter Idea:** Anchoring a citadel on grid with another citadel allows both sides to summon waves of diamond rats that follow 3 lanes towards each citadel. The corp of the citadels can form 5-man fleets of capsuleer pilots, which can then participate in the battle to earn aurum that allows them to upgrade their ships.     
---
As the capsuleer ships of each team get stronger, they can use multiple strategies to gain an advantage. These strategies can include securing objectives, killing enemy capsuleeer ships and farming aurum by killing enemy rats. The stronger a team gets, the more capable they are at destroying the enemy team and their citadel.     
---
[Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/fvoNuYH.png)
---
Perhaps some concerns are designed...
---
Before Lifeblood I had to actually put stuff at REAL risk, like emptying the POS with DSTs in Lowsec (multiple runs), you know the place where all these bad people live that don't want to let you afk-mine in peace. 
---
It is today this is a risk-averse and mostly multibox-afked "activity" supported by semi-legal Bots like TACO/NEAR2, so you can actually watch netflix and do not have to play the game actually ...
---
It has been ccped
---
Wait that's gone?
---
WTF?
---
I don't understand this suggestion. More people means likely less pirates it would make more sense in low population areas. Also why put more strain on the most loaded systems?
---
At this point I gave up on it and switched to Star Citizen. That project at least has something to show which I can also play and does make progress. With CCP i know that they ever announce a full cancellation of Nova or they announce their next shooter project...
---
Accurate, question tho....
---
what about the hauler alts to bring ships and ammo?
---
P I R A T has 150 wars. Most are continuing through the structure timer as they dont care.
---
"THE SERPENTIS CORPORATION HAS BEEN SUFFERING HEAVY LOSSES..."
---
Seriously though, other than that one scope report playing every 5 mins or so, watching the statistics fly by on the TV was cool.
---
So you used a carrier as the transportation for all of your belongings? Doesn't that attract a lot of attention in low and null? I was also under the impression one couldn't use a capital sized ship in highsec.
---
Agree that these were actually kind of cool but that the lack of meaningful rewards doomed them.
---
they're pulling the mittens strategy est during wwb..
---
When you say "capital alt", are you referring to an alternate character or an alternate ship?
---
Which are actually gas sites, not combat sites. I usually just hack those with a T3 and tank the rats.
---
I went out solo roaming for the first time in years in a Stabber I had in Delve.  Discovered INIT was in Querious now.  A lone Moa showed up, then disengaged for some reason after we started brawling.  I guess I should be thankful I didn't get caps dropped on me, but rather ended up with a half dozen Triglavian ships and a Typhoon after me.  
---
I'm not real familiar with the Triglavian.  Are they kitey, or why pick those?
---
You should be fine in a shuttle too, those have a much higher warp speed than a capsule.
---
That's when your girlfriend/wife has a headache
---
Depends. If you're jumping from station to station then you're pretty much guaranteed to be safe. There are also quieter regions of lowsec that are less populated. If you're cynoing in a stationless system in a safespot in the middle of faction warfare space in a prime timezone when local is busy... then it's slightly less safe.
---
It does have unique things in LP store.
---
It isn't 3 mill an hour under the worst of cercomsrances
---
I didn't suggest you would, or should. I'm merely stating you didn't go out in a blaze. Nothing less, nothing more.
---
Maybe you poke the miner to lure out his risk averse buddies that have docked when you entered system ?
---
But it may backfire, as they only docked to swap to their Boson-Titan on the Keepstar for an honourable 1vs1 at the outgate  ...
---
They kill an afk krab, then run if you log in 2 more people than they have. Best of eve, no argument.
---
tbh I don't even understand why come if all you do is run away?
---
your posting
---
There isn't really a point for this line of dialogue to continue when your statements are so far from reality it's not even worth trying to pull at the threads that might have glimmer of truth. Have a good day mate.
---
He’s referring to a character, but the ship is the necessary part. The alt is for convenience. You can also just use a much easier to make cyno-alt character (or friend) in order to actually travel properly.
---
You are inferring that my posting is what led to Doom's post about burning TEST to the ground and then the incumbent ire that TEST has for PL? That is definitely an interesting line of thought. I don't know that it's accurate, but we can go with it.
---
Thanks for your reply! Since you seem to know your stuff, I have some minutae questions about j-space. I don't live there "yet", but will move out there by the end of the year.
---
1) Once relic/data sites have been completed, blue loot and salvage collected, etc, does a can spawn that you then hack? If so, about what is the value of the contents of a successfully hacked can?
---
2) I hear about people using Astrahus' to kill drifter battleships. How should I fit and where should I anchor an astra for this purpose?
---
3) Are high hacking/salvage skills necessary for j-space, or can I get by with T1 salvagers and hacking modules?

That would require goons to first be intelligent
---
good fight!
---
&gt;.&gt; dont forget the VR
---
this.
---
&gt; You're literally arguing against automobiles by complaining that they're making your livery stable business obsolete.
---
I just got it yet, but this coming from a Republican is hilarious. From my point of view I could say you are literally argueing against modern concepts of propulsion and energy as it would make the 150-year-old concept of oil burners and coal power plants obsolete XD
---
&gt;PvP means BOTH players are fighting each other
---
Buddy, do you actually know what game you're playing?
---
If you come to Horde space, you better come hungry!  
---
'Cause standing fleet is gonna FEED YOU.
---
That's what a fedora tipper would say.
---
You could also just undock and get a fight.
---
Step 1: Change to artillery and range tank. Use 1/20th the ammo.  
---
Step 2: Reprocess everything, scrap metal reprocessing 1 will work.  
---
Step 3: Purchase and use a BPO for the t1 ammo type you want to use.
---
Like 50 real people with some good batphones forward deploying vs a small coalition and the then strongest supercap force in the game forward deploying vs a single newbie alliance for like the 50th time is like basically the same thing just get good and adapt lmao.
---
t. you
---
Mind explaining what strawman I'm employing here?  You just seem to be throwing terms around that you don't know how to use.
---
Jokes on you, I'm unsubbed
---
Plus if we consider small sov alliances as third world countries, than EVE is almost certainly ahead there.
---
Like most elite PvPers, I started this game with 5 accounts in order to have an optimized killboard.
---
... did this person really just say they're playing Star citizen because that project "has something to show for it"? Am I out of the loop, did star citizen finally become a legitimate game?
---
Good talk.
---
That thread you linked was very informative.
---
Well, there are things you can do, it's still in Alpha. I don't enjoy it, but here goes.
---
You can do pve in two different zones, single or multiplayer skirmish, that's been in for a long time.
---
You can do racing on two different tracks irc
---
You can play in the persistent universe, do a little fps, do some missions and pvp in space and shop at a few shops. Overall it's not a game yet, but you can see progress each patch, so it is moving.
---
By the time the game comes out though, I don't know if I will give a shit anymore.
---
I remember their dev blog explaining how to add custom videos to the client so you could stick whatever you wanted on TV.
---
At one point I was planning to put their Scope Videos into a format which could be downloaded to the relevant folder and allow you to actually have the most recent Scope news play.
---
CCP plz fix loophole
---
its almost like isk is meaningless
---
Karmafleet was formed out of what leadership that was left from brave. And phorde was made just as brave died syphon off members.
---
pretty much what PM_ME_YOUR_AWOX said, i used the Carrier only in Lowsec.
---
For Null Stuff i cynoed into a near Lowsec Station and did DED Sites with my Tengus or Ratted in empty Systems until i got noticed. 
---
You have to be carefull, check Killboard of Systems for activity, Calculate your Fuel etc etc
---
this is just a dumb
---
and it's entirely possible that blazing bunny is also correct that the fleet was handed off with freemove but that doesn't change the fact that DJ set the fleet to freemove after being asked to.
---
Yeah no sorry, still not convinced it was a good thing, there was no need to go that far as making an alliance that popular disband. Brave took years to somewhat recover while karmafleet just boosted goons even more
---
It would be enough if could get a variety of empire faction items in the same way as FW provides them. The LP store however would need to be reviewed heavily to not invalidate existing items in the FW LP stores.

Did we really need a post for this?

Nowhere

I'm getting a lot of salt from this post.

This is why you shouldn’t take fitting advice from randoms off the internet
---
Holy shit
---
A Corvette tournament? I understand starting small, but perhaps this is a bit too small...
---
Corvette PVP is the most end game ship I could think of.
---
They're quite versatile, they also have great tracking and ramping damage which makes them attractive. Plus, they're shiny new stuff.
---
It's on Thunderdome.
---
so many dev resources for absolutely nothing tho, i for one do not miss it at all, just wish we got some dynamic content to replace
---
Just buy the damn mineral. A full load of Kryos (with Gallante industry ship skill 4) should make ammo that lasts for like, idk really, a few months or so.
---
I'm sure the absolutely insane decision to allow friendly fire, which was exploited ad nauseum by trolls from Something Awful, and took weeks and weeks to fix, had nothing to do with the baby essentially dying in the crib.
---
I see, sorry didn't know what that was at first.
---
I guess that was the city-states/kingdoms part of this game.
---
haha, thx for the summary. Looks like I skipped all the stratops and ihub defence. Can't say I missed those :d .
---
While you're here, WTF happened to CO2 ? I followed my corp there before leaving, we moved to Dw-something, and then it kind of disappeared ? again ?
---
Yeah I snagged a lot of salty chimps in the replies
---
How much skill and whats the minimum ship required to fly a level 3 frigate abyssal? Assuming I can find 2 other ppl to fly with similar level of skill and hulls.
---
Exactly, one of the only other places where you see narratives this strong is POLITICS.
---
Why don't you write an en24 article about it seraph? Or maybe another one about how the /r/eve discord banning you means ccp should intervene in its managment.
---
There's a few factors. 
---
Depends on how much faction loot dropped, how much you can cram into your astero, and how quick you can gtfo before someone scrams you with your new suspect flag.
---
A bit to versatile if you ask me. There to good in all categories.
---
Getting over it ***^(with CCP)***
---
The nearly completed blue donut seems to invalidate that statement, but I'll still give you the benefit of the doubt
---
Hacking skills can be done in T1 analyzers + moderate hacking skills in a frigate bonus for it (Astero, Covert Ops or even T1 frigates). Salvaging is another thing, you need pretty good salvaging skills to salvage Sleeper wrecks [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Salvaging#Wormholes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Salvaging#Wormholes). You're going to need Salvaging V and a T2 Salvager, or T1 Salvager, Salvaging rigs and Salvaging IV at the very least.
---
 Note that the salvaging is not really worth it compared to the blue loot, roughly 5% of the value of the site is found in salvage. If you have a spare alt or have run all of the sites, you can salvage it, but you're better off just getting all of the blue loot and moving to another site.
---
When Eve has more vetting than the American Presidency.

:Effort:  
---
What r u gonna do tell me to watch contrapoints
---
as someone in cynou and has seen doom's thought process through this: it is.
---
for the last few years the way to win the game is turbokrabbing until you have enough titans that the other side has no reasonable counterplay. no actual combat happens. for a pvp focused player who want to be the best, no part of that process is fun. so why bother?
---
the state of the game is the problem.
---
You forgot an alt shittalking in local
---
**Counter Counter Counter Idea:** Rats block off all stargates leading in the system that fight is occurring and the fleets dissolve into smaller fleets of 3 people and everyone else becomes red. Also, there is a deadly field of sorts that closes in on a random point in system every 3-5 minutes. Occasionally there will be a cyno drop in a random point in space with containers with ammo and different modules, as well as a mobile depot to refit. Eventually, last fleet standing gets to be on the screen as the match ends.
---
DM me.
---
You can go to a FW area in lowsec in anything frigate-sized (not T2), got to a novice plex and you can get some nice solo fights. It's not that hard.
---
Go back to mining spod you goon galaxy brain.
---
They could've hired a team of PhDs to finally figure out the POS code.
---
You get more range, not yield, and more cargo for ore on mining ships not yield
---
Yeah, they seem to enjoy debuting ships a bit too strong. Remember when the Orthrus came out? Felt like everyone who could afford to, flew it.
---
who cares what you post?
---
I don't think anybody takes doom seriously. Honestly he is down there with elo knight in terms of people who compulsively lie about shit and then skitter away when confronted.  Good Riddance.
---
How much is your credit limit on your credit cards?
---
Used to see this thinking all the time in the early days apocrypha, a bling fit mission ship in wh space and as soon as you tackle them they sit there dead stick, until you know, they were dead.
---
 I always got the impression the thinking was if I dont engage then I havent been pvp'd to death, and mentally I can write this off as a pve loss
---
A fit that is in effectively no risk of being lost.
---
Old news
---
I didn't give a shit about him and i celebrated cause that kinda shit shouldn't be acceptable. 
---
Call people fucking retards, asshats, shitstains whatever. 
---
But real threats and telling people to kill themselves are over the line for me.
---
Its wierd that faction guns in general doesnt do anything different than t2.. maybe low dmg/long range or some other different tradeoffs.
---
That's the fun of the game. You pick a side, shit on the other side, rinse repeat. I love arguing with nerds on the internet about completely inconsequential things.
---
At the same time, go to any Eve meetup and you'll see plenty of "enemy" players hanging out, chatting and buying each other drinks. Hell, I've despised PL and everything they stand for for pretty much my entire Eve career, and then I go to Eve Vegas and spend a few hours learning how to play craps with Elise Randolph. 
---
It's only the people who take this shit too seriously or personal that ruin it. 99% of the players realize this is a game and shitting on other tribes is just another part of the game.
---
&gt; Why not calculate cost to repair as proportionate to assets in the respective citadel and/or the number of players in the corp holding it, AND the size of said citadel?
---
because the nobody would use them
---
what would be the point?
---
People always forget that summer in Iceland is brief and worth taking full advantage of :D Keep up the great work!
---
Not much, like very not much.

Currently assuming that something didn't work.

Or you could just punch into the novice plex like a normal person.
---
Not really, ganking expensive mission runners is a lucrative activity. Doing more DPS to a mission runner than it can handle is pretty easy if you know the resist holes.

The Hoarder is your friend

Thread sucks.
---
This thread is now about what race industrial to train.

It’s like you can physically see how far their heads are stuffed into their rectums.

Yeah, the PvE players are the ones leaving.  SkillU were such krabs, the game's better off without them right?
---
[last week’s thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c05l0l/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_june_13/)
---
If you need a ship worth more than 500m for hisec missions you're doing it wrong.
---
Exactly, you're a fucking nobody that doesn't know shit outside of the super umbrella'd 'empire' that you didn't do shit to help build.
---
You didn't 'do the work' at all, you just leech off of it while huffing and puffing about how great the 'empire' is lmao. Get the fuck over yourself mate
---
Yup.. lets get those designers into coding.
---
Haha tears extracted. Op success!
---
What are the damage requirements to reinforce citadels? I remember there’s a max damage per second, and a minimum damage to reach before you do any damage. Also does it change for shield/armor/hull? What about the ehp of each?
---
I thought extinction war was what they were calling legacy vs winterco. since pandas vs dinos.....that shit in the north of NCPL + GOTG vs goons was just a deployment remember /s
---
To get the best tics (90m/hr), you'd want to do it in a Machariel, fitted with a couple faction or deadspace modules. You can also gank it by baiting it into attacking you by becoming suspect. You'd be surprised how often a lot of people fall for it.
---
I did this but in a wormhole and stayed in that particular hole for a couple months living out of an Orca. It's a fun distraction but i think it's best to have at least a few friends with you
---
You mean there's space that isn't nullsec!? Next you'll be saying getting a super/titan isn't the main goal every eve player should strive for to measure progression! /s
---
I got through in an iteron the other day, the gatecamps aren’t that bad.

Seriously, I think a lot of people forget that Eve is more than nullsec politics.

Saw someone trying to do this with a Orca in wspace.

No shit buddy... Although it would be really cool if there were massive invasion forces into null that would require large fleets and caps to fend off.

B-52 Phoenix FTW

How much money from roulette?
---
Even better: "It only takes two weeks of training to be on par with the pros, so there's no barrier to entry for new players!"
---
Machs are cheap these days, you don't need to purple it. Your argument is that people are stupid and will attack flashys? I don't see how this changes anything with my original argument.
---
Yeah you have to spend more on the fit to be successful with it in hisec, but you also are extremely safe. You don't have to be blingy, those extra couple of percentiles isn't going to make or break it, so being suicide ganked is less of a threat if at all. You don't have to be a fucking retard and shoot flashys, and you can even simply change your overview to only show NPCs so you wouldn't be tempted to lock or accidentally lock a suspect bait.
---
I think Frog Brothel is my favorite
---
&gt;You won't see me 
---
Well ya, flair.
---
You need to do 10% of damage cap (including resists) otherwise the structure starts repairing. It's the same damage cap for all stages (only number off the top of my head is 625 dps for Raitaru and probably Astrahus too, since damage cap is 5000dps and structure has 20% resists across the board). This damage is measured over a 20 seconds period, so you need to be doing 200% of damage cap over a 20 second period. If your ship does close to the dps in paper dps, it may dip once you factor in reload time.
---
Here's a good guide for all the relevant info (available in english on the top right button):

I bought myself a cupcake to mark the occasion.
---
I did this with a family member in an Orca recently. It was pretty OK with the Orca to swap out ships, refresh ammo, run remote reps to refill buffer fit ships, etc, and I could stash loot in the (cloaked) Orca until I had a good, clean path to a HS near Jita. I'd definitely consider the Orca if you're looking to go nomad.
---
Hah.. nice :P
---
Carrier 1v1s please
---
Join BSB and check the killmails for 1 hour. 90% are with no alts. 10% is with a ceptor alt because the main is using a ship too slow to tackle. If you need all these to get solo kills you're either very bad or you're afraid to take any risks.
---
Probably a libertarian in RL.
---
When you download Eve on Steam it creates a new Eve account linked to your steam account. From the reviews on steam about the Eve products, the orders made by Steam are directly send to this new Steam linked account. You should contact CCP support and/or Steam support.
---
Yup
---
The reality was back in 2009-2010 if you were a small group attempting to branch out into nullsec, you'd be fighting another small group - BAM PL caps and supers would appear and kill everyone. 
---
  They stuck to small, easy targets, or newbie groups - like BRAVE later on.
---
Ghi102 gave you his opinion, I’ll give you mind and I’ll try to answer your others questions :)
---
If you’re leaving in a wormhole on your own, you want to get the best amount of ISK you can before the next highsec connection spawn (which is why I tend to prefer wormhole that DO NOT have an Highsec static). For me, this mean also running the sites in their entirety.
---
1. Data and relic sites in wormhole space are classified in two categories : Pirate sites (Guristas, Sansha’s, etc), without any rats and you just have to use the right hacking tool to get the loot, the very important thing is that the loot table is the same of nullsec sites, which mean you can get great amount of ISK out of those in a short amount of time (especially with Sansha’s Relic sites !).
---
The others ones are Sleeper sites (Unsecured for Data, Forgotten for Relic), which contain multiple waves of sleeper drones. Something to remember : sleeper exploration sites are considered one level above of your wormhole class (example, a sleeper data site in a C2 has the difficulty of a C3 combat site), which also mean the blue loot and salvage you get from those are more valuable.
---
One thing to note about Sleeper site : they do not disappear if you don’t successfully hack EVERY can in them, empty or not. This is quite important, as it mean you have a signature that will be there for way longer than normal, which might prevent new ones to appear if you are the only inhabitant of a wormhole region (i.e : sites in other wormholes of the same regions aren’t ran, so they can’t respawn).
---
2. Drifter battleships in wormhole space are WAY tougher than the ones in known space. However, they only spawn in six special wormholes (called Drifter Hives, or Drifter Wormholes), or in combat anomalies of C5 and C6 wormholes as optional bosses than don’t always spawn. This special drifters won’t help the Sleepers, but are always hostile, and also have special mechanics unique to them, like being able to warp out of the site they spawned in. If they aren’t killed and do warp out, they will roam around the wormhole, randomly warping to celestials, citadels (where they are indeed lured and killed it the citadel is manned) or sometimes wormholes.
---
As such, you can anchor your Astrahus pretty much anywhere you want, you just have to wait for a Drifter to warp on it if you do get one to spawn in a higher end wormhole. Considering he fit, I’d say point, stuff to help you apply your damage (target painter, web) and subcapital guns with cruise missiles loaded.
---
3. Hacking skills, it depends. Completing your sites quick mean you’ll spent less time in deep waters out of the safety of your citadels, which leave more time for a cloaky hunter to take a shot at you. However, Sleepers data and relic sites have very weak cans (green nodes, same as highsec), so even a T1 exploration frigate should be able to burn through them with relative ease, so long that you clear the sites first !
---
You’d still want a bit more skills, like Hacking and Archeology IV, to complete the Pirate exploration sites in shorter time (and be careful, if you fail the hack mini game twice, the can will explode and you’ll have no loot !).
---
Salvaging skill, however, require advanced skills, as Sleepers have the most difficult wrecks to salvage in the game ! So far, I’ve been doing greatly with a Catalyst sporting T1 salvagers and T2 salvage rigs, with the related skill to IV. However, if you want to get your salvaging done for cheaper, you can always aim for T2 salvage modules, but I find the train to Salvaging V to be too long for what it gives (and it doesn’t fit well in my skill queues anyway).
---
One last note on what our friend Ghi102 said about salvaging : do it. Yes, it’s not the best ISK you’ll get out of your sites, but it’s still free money ripe for the taking. And sincerely, with the help of MTUs and a good salvage destroyer (or Noctis, if you’re really willing to look like a total idiot), salvaging is done in no time and can even give you the materials to start your little T3 industry from the safety of your home, if you based in something like a C3 wormhole or above !
---
&gt; max damage per second  
---
5k (6.25k before resists) for astra, you'll deal the full 6.25k if low power  
---
dunno about forts or keeps but should be something proportionally gay
---
&gt; minimum damage to reach before you do any damage  
---
10% of the damage cap, but wrong thinking  
---
all damage gets done, but not all damage stops *repair timer* so if you can't beat that to finish line sucks2bu
---
&gt; Also does it change for shield/armor/hull?
---
damage thresholds should be the same but plates might influence it if they are fitted [idk](http://images7.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED147/5555264465acb.jpeg)
---
My OCD.  Missing Greek letters and order is incorrect
---
They can be kitey, they can be brawly, they're beefy, they're quick, they have neuts (usually), they have lots of damage, and the damage ramps the longer you fight them.
---
They're great ships.
---
Except the frigate.
---
my tv remote has a netflix button. ccpls

I do it in a Tristan ...

Yup, if ya ask me the best nerf would be just make them not as tanky as most ship's. Seems it would be fitting for what they are.

Nomad Legions (any T3) am fun if you don't want to use alts

Oh shit I remember that. I don’t understand the slow response CCP has to fixing exploits like that. Like what the fuck?

Master the art of aligning to your warp out, looting as you pass by the wreck, and hitting warp right as you go flashy :P
---
THIS IS OUR SWAMP NOW
---
Is it still going to be next week when you bring it or has your arrival been pushed forward to sooner?
---
There's vetting, then there's corps that put you on trial before you're fully accepted. 
---
President gets off easy.
---
It could count as another way to make isk to fund your pvp, it's fun to many people, and it doesn't hurt to have more options :&gt;
---
I'm not arguing, I'm speaking from experience. People can get quite mad too if you destroy their mtu. "Just don't be dumb" works for most people, but there are still a lot of dumb people in the game, especially in hisec.
---
Just like that
---
# WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP

holy fucking shit, lmao

Especially when it's Mist at the head of it all. Guy literally has a 24/7 raging PVP boner.

How do you know he is not already there? :P

A disgusting lack of GOLEM in this video.

This is a bad post.

Still ingame. Nobody using them though, so CCP will remove them in about eight years from today.

There would be a Golem if John hadn't lost it in highsec

More range and ore hold not yield

It's probably got the minimum so it's fueled and gets an armor RF timer.

Doesn't work that way.   Lots of experienced players are leaving.

Bad Dragon Manufacturing Plant Raitaru XD
---
Ogres are like onions
---
Damnit ccp, in those station descriptions you have written "seeded" when you mean ceded.
---
So we already do have faxes that sit around for 2 hours waiting to protect people. Moving the capital umbrella isn’t that hard and we do it almost every other weekend for our locust fleets of R64 moons. If we were forced to do it for normal living, I think we could and we already control 4 regions with influence in 2 more.
---
ya figured out the jump range yet?
---
Able to fit covert to my astero today.

"A" + Click on warp to target. Then wait and then smash warp? Trying to make sure I'm doing this right.

That sounds much better than titan and supercarrier fleets.

Kikimora vs. scram stabber, even or not?

I still feel like a newb but I remember Svipuls online (nerfed 2 months after I skilled into it.   of course.)
---
I remember reading about all the fleet fights being in Ishtars orbiting Sentry drones.  And then in WWB it was all about Machariels.

Of course now it is all about cap proliferation.

They dropped the wars (by not paying the bill) so it won't die. They'll redec when it's fully repped. And then repeat.

When I transfer or receive ISK to a character not on my APIs , the corp I'm applying to asks me about that transaction. Unfortunately, the same can't be said in real life.

Here's an idea. If a war deccer doesn't pay their bill when the war goal struct is RF'd, the struct is killed by concord and there's a 2 week cooldown with all the war dec  that are now without HQ.
---
lol, nope
---
Those chucklefucks, damn PIRAT.
---
the reason dreads are good is because you get more fuel and cargo than a carrier. carriers are marginally safer though because they can kill tackle without having to siege, but tbh for a pure suitcase it's such a niche case that you're better off making logistics easier on yourself.
---
of course, carriers get a separate bay for all their weapons, and dread guns are big sooooo... it depends.
---
Aw shit, here we go again...

There are places that haven't been discovered yet apparently.

In Soviet Sholupen, Aridia cyno to uuuu
---
&gt;Reality is a tactical decision was made not to finish the job with WWB. It was an error, then subsequent error of not returning ro disrupt their growth was a nail in the coffin for the "other" playstyle.
---
So it is not the "State of the Game" but rather the state of the game that is to blame here?
---
0.01 less that the other guy
---
I would think that all the pirate alliances would be rejoicing that the wardec costs have been reduced to a flat 100m. I guess that removes the need for botting nyxes *cough cough*
---
Your delusional self-image of not being the most retarded roamers you are is really strong today, really no way I'm breaking through that much narcissism and bigotry, have a good day hunting those afk krabs and running from response too.
---
True solo removes quite many options though - like you will rarely go true solo in a 1-2b+ cruiser/BC/BS (unless overprop cruiser / sansha ships), mostly because each jump might be your last. Scout alt makes navigation much safer.
---
place the wreck between yourself and the thing you want to warp to
---
align to what you want to warp to.
---
mash 'loot all'
---
mash 'warp'

I can just hear that "fus ro DAH" sound effect when you smack that kiki in the face. Again, nice job squishsquish!

If you are using at least 3 accounts you could do a kind of mobile BLOPS. You would need a character that can light a covert cyno, a black ops battleship, and a blockade runner, and if you have more than 3 anything else you want with a covert cloak. The setup would let you go anywhere, hisec, lowsec, nullsec, wh space as long as you find holes the battleship can fit through
---
Carrier alt is a good choice as you can suitcase ships in it, and do an occassional memedrop when needed. If you are really rich, you can use a supercarrier, 2.5x the space and you can volley carriers in it, and it can jump around and cloak. Also, who are these "clients" that you speak of?
---
That caldari one looks a little like the angel hex skin, but cooler
---
Sent back to mexico where they have no net.

Yeah, also anything that can do the mwd+cloak trick will be fine because the npcs aren't going to go for the decloak on you.
---
Oh man, bring back the colorful NeoCom icons, at least optional :(
---
I can see where this is going whenever an eve player "quits". It is simply impossible to quit eve. I have encountered several people that decided to quit for good, and then get reeled back in by some sort of change, or a big war, or whatever. It'll happen here im guessing.

&gt; So how do you escape the first 5 min delay by having more players?
---
Player one has 5 minute delay, and player 2 doesn't? Rather obvious here, dude.
---
&gt; What do you think "isk fountain" means?
---
So your issue is people being too rich, and NOT what they can do with that money? Then why are you made about injectors?
---
&gt; You have to take into consideration that CCP is apparently unable to detect a bot that runs 23/7 for months. There is a ton of low hanging fruit.
---
Spider tank vexors
---
Where would I be able to get a BPO for one of those? I need it for... scientific purposes
---
I solo roam BS and battleships as my primary ships of choice. Even solo roamed in my Golem. No alts/scouts. They did eventually get dropped, but thats the life of a marauder. Having a stiletto alt wouldnt have changed those outcomes as they got cynod on it.
---
What i learned from losing a couple golems is to use zkill as my "alt" and religiously check every person to make sure they arent a cyno alt. I have a better intuition on how long to stay near someone's staging before heading out to create a trickle of ships, instead of a blob. I learn about my opponents every fight and can focus on the fight and what i did right or wrong, instead of splitting focus on an alt. Sometimes i dont get the fight i wanted or i get outplayed by better bait/tactics, but i learn from nearly every fight.
---
Battleships also have a lot of options/utility for true solo. Heavy neuts, grappler, large drone bays (ec drones) and MJD. Relying on those tools and target selection can help get you out of most sticky situations before the blob. And, since everyone underestimates battleships, make it fairly easy to get fights.
---
But being forced to stop cuts that isk/hr way way down.
---
But the VNI would have to stop, while the other wouldn't.
---
And the VNI is actually at risk of being killed.
---
Why not ~both~ neither?
---
actually it is...
---
Just sit on both with a boson, perfect content!
---
Oh my lolol
---
BRING SOLO BACK
---
Pretty easy to have a fax on each side of the regional gap.
---
I used to PvP solo in wormhole space, that is with ONE toon fighting one or more opponents.  
---
I used to fly a Rook to solo PVP in wormholes until CCP broke ECM for solo ships.
---
If this game still has a server in 10 years.
---
Oh yes my Bantam looked pristine! Sane as my Imicus. Beautiful ships.
---
Anyone with an active dec could in theory. And then they'd get a KM for probably an astra with a clone bay and a bit of fuel.
---
same lol
---
Oh man, it sure must suck not having all of those NPC stations in every system in hisec to freely have ships stations in. Ohwait.
---
And jojo's point is that if you are going to the trouble of organizing  a gank op like this in the first place its probably better to go with the 100% success rate rather than getting 'lucky'.
---
That's the sad thing. Titans and suppers are meant to be the next best thing up from dreadnought and carriers yet most rather the lesser.
---
Solo is actual solo: just you, on that character. Any alt, friend, spy or whatever other character you may have an excuse for makes it "solo", as in not at all solo. 
---
Obviously this simple and basic fact hurts lots of people's ego's, so many will be angry at people pointing it out.
---
Hull tank Brutix Navy
---
Yeah but that's a other problem. Leaders and FC's leaving isn't necessary a bad thing. No one to replace them is.
---
Remember that fleet interceptors are bubble immune and so are tech 3 cruisers with the nullifier subsystem.
---
Tbh i think adding even more SP loss would be dumb. In the age of injectors it would increase the gap between rich and poor even more because it would ultimately mean only the people that can (or want to) afford injectors can use certain ships on a regular basis. 
---
The idea of expanding the Subsystem system to other ships sounds nice but it shouldnt be tied to the shitty mechanic that is SP loss. 
---
I understand Titan and Super losses should be more meaningfull but sadly we are way past the point where even there is a gap between that guy that camps a gate with his 6 Titans and the guy that just got his first one for which he saved ages.  
---
And for other ships it would be just dumb. Even for T3's it's dumb. I understood it before when they dominated the meta but they're nowhere near strong enough to justify SP loss anymore.
---
Can you add your flair so we know who is triggered so much by our visits?
---
About 20-25 days for ceptor.... And Omega clone state.
---
Ok, in all seriousness: the CSM does not have any power. Even some of the changes they think they had an effect on were planned long before they even knew about it.
---
Sure, why not?
---
What are the rules, schedule and such?
---
Cool Meme : )
---
yea +1 i’d like to know too. are people getting paid for this? 😛
---
Eve most definitely needs colorful (shit)lords. But there is a line. And since you once chose to allign yourself with this one, you could not have picked a worse example to make your, in itself, valid point.

Sounds like a Lussy Lu solo tutorial  😆
---
lol. Someone's salty about losing systems last night
---
I still advocate for removing excavators. Rorquals wouldn't be broken if it wasn't for the fact that they are swiss army knives. Make people have to bring multiple different ships for mining again. Honestly since theres panic and porpoises now they shouldn't even be able to boost.  
---
Take these two things away from them and they would still be usefull utility for a mining fleet while not being "the jack of all trades mastwe
---
For high sec use an orca or a bowhead freighter my guy.
---
Bowhead freighter you can pack all your ships into. This is literally it's only use is transporting ships around and ammunition
---
And multiple people have explained this to you; we've been doing exactly that for literal years and they continue to ignore us in most instances. What is it people say about doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results?
---
There's nothing wrong with preying on little guys, but PIRAT goes about it in probably the most pathetic way imaginable. Watch how fast they warp off in their blingy proteuses if you try to engage them in anything that looks like it might be a threat.
---
Stopped reading at old moon mining was better.  It was not for many many many players.  Unless you were in a big Alliance, moon mining basically did not exist to you.  New moon mining is 100% better and one the reasons I still play this game.
---
 Ore buyback offers alliance income opportunity, and ccp should introduce tools to better enable that.  Old moon mining was cancer, you just have rose tinted glasses because you got to take advantage of it for years.
---
Agree on the other points mostly.
---
Another one of these.. yes we know eve is dying faster yes there is multiple ways to actually fix this
---
The problem isn't that CCP don't know the problems or how to fix eve,it's how slow CCP is when it comes to implementing shit and prioritizing the right stuff
---
By their powers combined, they are Captain Autism.
---
Oh, the daily "eve is dying" post is finally there
---
Bots break.
---
Sometimes, if I listen very careful, I can hear my alts whisper to eachother

I'm creating a mobile merc army that moves and take residence in the client's system or chosen location depending on the client's needs. If the client doesn't pay, the army packs up and moves on to greener pastures.

I CTRL + F'ed to see how many times "goon" was in that wall of text.  It appeared 8 times.
---
But who will evict us now, or not care about what Vily thinks!!!
---
As a newish player no options exist for hauling your ships around safely.   A capital ship alt is the way to go.  You will want it this way if you keep playing Eve.  If you require an explanation then best thing you could do is join Horde and then get on discord and mumble and get on some fleets and learn to play various aspects of the game. 
---
You will not learn to be good at this game by reading this sub.  Or by reading anything for that matter.  You have to get in comms and get involved.  
---
Oh and BTW, most of us have 2 or more accounts if not 3.  I use 3...  all omega.  Just not other way to effectively use capitals ships without them.
---
Been a while since i played, did they remove this?
---
Again, I like the breeze.
---
They make you cry? Or they smell bad? LoL
---
I had people in brave unironically say we should go to the designated fighting region because tackling a carrier with about 15 enyos and deacons is a reason to drop ~30 caps on us
---
None.  Remove ore anomaly too.  We have moons for that.
---
CCP: Gives people direct ability to input outside resources into the client
---
Also CCP: Why the hell would you do this?!
---
On point 2, all you need to do is just give all structures but citadels 1 timer when at full power and 0 when not at full power. You still get your big fights, but you also get the benefits of the new moon system.
---
Well, it won't work, but good luck to you
---
This same thing has been posted multiple times, it is a thing, so be prepared to get fucked when doing C5s. Bug or not, it's a thing that has gotten a few people killed.
---
I am my friends
---
Hiding in station and hoping goons come back and save them isn't hard. I don't think they need help doing that.
---
Criterion. Labs producing top quality memes. Nice job Yaar.
---
I'm sure people told CCP that the way timers worked was going to make it impossible to kill the structure within the war, before it even hit TQ.
---
Structure timers in K space are way too long in general - you have asset safety anyway, why do they need to be 5 times longer than J space? But with war timers being a week and the structure timer being a week, you're always going to be able to meme the timers.
---
Their numbers might just do that to you though. I've seen areas that had 40+
---
I ran a caravan style project a while back in drone regions with the following:
---
1 Carrier/Black Ops character
---
1 Covert Transport Ship character (JF also works)
---
2 Stratios characters
---
2 Scanning/Covert Cyno Characters (T3 preferred)
---
I would begin by locating a staging system in null space in drone regions or even negotiating use of a system in return for logistics assistance.  I used the carrier as a suitcase for my BLOPS, extra fittings, surplus drones, spare interceptors, asteros, and T3s.  I use a POS to stage from as it is easy to deploy and tear down as needed unlike citadels.  If it gets reinforced, just leave it and drop another due to how cheap they are.  If people wanna waste the time to reinforce it without a fight more power to them.  If it gets camped just pack up and cyno out and setup a new one.  These are literally throw away.  Now create safes in different directions from your staging POS as well as safes 500KM+ away from your POS on grid.  Once you have everything setup and in system send out the scanners with covert cyno.  You are looking for a few specific drone regions signatures called Radiance and Hierarchy.
---
1.) Send out scanners to locate sigs and do this by constellation sending your scanners to two different constellations within bridge range of your staging
---
2.) Once you locate one go ahead and covert bridge a stratios to begin clearing - once clear bring in bridger (Have equip in cargo and mobile depot) rinse and repeat with both stratios pilots.  You can usually find systems with 2-3 of these sites so start with those first.
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Radiance](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Radiance)
---

---
3.) Collect as many "Molting Season" and "Trouble in Paradise" escalations as you feel like running for the next 24 hours
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Molting\_Season](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Molting_Season)
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trouble\_in\_Paradise](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trouble_in_Paradise)
---
4.) Blitz all escalations - Make sure to loot and salvage all Sentient spawns as this is the primary income source
---
5.) Return all loot to transport character, then bridge out towards market if needed.
---
My initial investment for this project was under 6b (not including skills as I already had them all on these characters) and I was easily topping 350m/h (blitzing is where it really comes from)  I will try and dig up the spreadsheet I did for this and post it later.   You can obviously scale up more stratios and scanning characters to where you are comfortable.  You can easily move all over the map in nomadic style.  Plenty of PVP opportunities if you want them or just avoid them.  Easy to swap all characters to bombers and pull out a hunter, just be aware this is going to draw unwanted attention.  Luckily you can just pickup and be in another region within two hours or leave the POS and be gone instantly.  Hope this helps you and good luck with whatever direction you decide to go.
---
I have no idea how to survive this, if there are neuts and webs - this is just impossible lol.
---
GM denied reimbursement.
---
So 1.6 B gila in the trashcan. Sad.
---
Check again, they dropped all the wars for the reinforced one. The other wars are with a different HQ.
---
Well, aren't you a peach.
---
Why we riot again?
---
I mean you coooould but you'd have to be on grid while at war so you'd be risking something. Don't expect that from PIRAT.
---
I had a similar issue recently traveling back from a trip to B-R5RB, got in a ceptor just to be smartbombed by some Machariels. 
---
I assume you dont have the skills or whatnot to fly interceptors, so at the least use the website https://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/
---
Good luck
---
I legit one time tackled my neutral tackle alt because I got excited not realizing it was me.
---
Is this true?
---
If so it's a really stupid loophole. Come on CCP...
---
Sounds like you never fitted a ship, undocked and went looking for a fight in lowsec.
---
You should.

They will release Dust1028 on ps4 now that the ps5 has been announced to come out in 2020.

I both hate and love this post
---
I tend to agree with you but I dislike that BlOps are useless in Jspace. While I dont want cynos it'd be nice to have some utility. I think the cap proliferation idea was just to spice up targets. Like sure you can ez rat in a dread but you'd have to have a BlOps to exfil. Just spitballing. Aside from fixing heavy missiles I dont think any of my opinions were really serious.
---
&gt;you're not catching pods of people that know what they're doing 
---
Well thank god we're fighting Pirat
---
Shto!
---
Why is it important that nothing is anchored? A pos would work, so would a fortizar.
---
The TLDR answer to the ills  of Eve is even sadder.  I don't believe it can be fixed.  Too many things like injectors, like Citadels, like Roquals and Titan proliferation, like cyno-jammers, (etc...) have caused us to get here.  Take what's CCP going to do - nerf out of existence all of that stuff to fix it?   No... that train has left the station.
---
I'm in a place that says we have to migrate to the next thing... call it Eve 2.0 or whatever.   And the faster CCP can start working on it, the better.
---
It's a very good proof of concept... Which is still more than Nova :/
---
Goons would just take Malpais, set up a keepstar in 0-TRV1 which has 205 systems in supercapital jump range (and much more in locust fleet range). Since its the place with the most systems in range we'd outcompete everyone else. 
---
How to ~~get~~ make balance in eve: 
---
1. Get yourself riled up because you want to crush your enemies in game for whatever dreamt-up reason you can get morale from. 
---
2. Do more mining/ratting/salvaging/incursions/relic sites/sleeper sites/invasion sites/thieving/etc than your enemy. 
---
3. Use the above spoils to get more ships and characters to fly them, than your enemy. 
---
4. Attack enemy with your vast cache of riches even if you lose a few ships, until the enemy GTFOs. 
---
5. Optional but helps: Recruit people (to game and to your alliance) even if they won't be perfect pilots, if they show up for ***one*** fleet in the war and shoot ***one*** primary target, YOU have to do less in points 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
---
6. Optional but helps: Never check zkill. As long as your war chest is going to be empty after the enemy's war chest then you have nothing to worry about, just keep logging in with blind optimism. 
---
7. Optional but helps: Don't be toxic to your fellow allies. If you're a greater cause of reduced allied morale than the enemy, then you're an idiot. 
---
8. Optional but helps: Never say no to anyone who volunteers to put in effort. For example someone who wants to become an FC or someone who wants to do boring logistics or someone who wants to rat. Encourage everyone to go forth and do things, no matter what it is. I don't do ratting or mining anymore myself (only do t2 industry) but if someone wants to try ratting or mining I'll be first to help them do it efficiently and well. maybe they'll get a titan before they tire of it and want to try something else. Then I'll encourage whatever their next endeavor is. Having your alliance drop structures for your members to use freely is also encouragement, because they can build stuff and do reactions and so forth without saving up for the structure first. 
---
9. optional but helps: Never call it a really really really important stratop unless its your staging keepstar/staging jammer/staging ihub being attacked. Everything else ***really*** is "if showing up for this would end in burnout then you shouldn't bother". The big groups seem to have had a lot of people simply quit the game outright because they demanded too much activity (the irony being they'd probably have way better numbers without calling it a very very very very very important stratop, if they never called ***every*** op very very very very very important). only those who for some unknown reason care about zkill being slightly greener, think along the lines of "But if we had one more person in our fleet for this pointless fortizar, then we'd have a slightly greener killboard in this fight. So lets call for maxmaxmaxmax numbers EVERY SINGLE TIME even for an egg and spoon race".
---
nah they have clones, so nothing to worry about (unless they have implants)
---
That's just the reality.
---
Mercenary corps don't really exist like what you're describing.
---
How? Bot broke.

Why? Bot broke.

If the kiki pilot is good and well fit, I want to say he should be able to out pilot the stabber. I also can't remember how fast a stabber goes off the top of my head, so i might be wrong and if the kiki can't burst down the stabber quickly he's going to die real quick.
---
The same reason most aliens on TV speak English (or whatever language you speak in your country).
---
Some things are being translated so we players can understand.
---
The game is just old, bud.  I'm sorry that you weren't here for the glory days, but you missed it.  The game is in decline, the original developer has cashed in (should be a clue for your ass), and it's in maintenance mode, meaning, the new owners are riding the cash flow, and not about to invest big money in old tech.
---
The player base is in decline and has been for a while.  It may hit some plateaus on the way down, but the trend is down.  If enjoy the game and can find some ways to have fun in it, do it while you can.  Don't worry too much about salty folks in reddit.  They aren't killing the game.  It's dying of natural causes - a.k.a old age.
---
Supers can't dock: Good idea.
---
The rest: ehhhhhh....
---
In a nutshell, a startup I helped a while back had a few possible "big-fish" clients, who were being wardec'ed, change their minds because the corp's base of operations was too far away from their region. They figured solid reinforcements was out of the picture since we would have to travel from one end of New Eden to another.
---
How about, if you use a structure for a war HQ, its timer becomes the same day as the war ends, and you have J space 1 day timers. If you use it for multiple wars then its timer is whichever comes first.
---
i mean, goons is the current powerhouse of eve, so people will naturally point fingers at em
---
New Eden residents are descended from Earthlings. They got here through the Eve Gate, a wormhole you can still visit in the Genesis region.
---
they have layers, one for shield, one for armor and one for hull
---
Evil Tron Phoenix looks good.
---
Isn't Wingspan practically the same thing? A mobile group that indulges in piracy rather than mercenary work?
---
Implying HK renters have an umbrella to jump on said cyno
---
Yeah what a scrub.
---
Unfortunately yes :(
---
You can do that in your carrier.
---
Why have 150% more shields by putting a LSE on your caracal when you could put a SSE on it and only get 30% more shields? It's pretty much a no brainer.
---
It's a rolling ship, don't over think it. Higgs, 100mn and either 500 or 50 depending on fitting then the rest for max speed and align.
---
To be Scrupulously Fair, at least 5-man HS mining corps that operate out of NPC stations or other peoples' structures can no longer be wardecced.
---
heard chef!
---
Blasters + hull tank?
---
Despite the technological dark age from the collapse of the Eve Gate, a standard 1G gravity could be inferred from the propensity of colonised planets averaging 1G (some more, some less, etc). 
---
Got absolutely nothing for other units of measurement though.
---
looks like a lot of avatar emotes and movement files too...
---
WiS2 incoming?
---
It was supposed to be much more. Our avatars walking around in stations, trading, talking and literally backstabbing.
---
Rome wasn't built in a day..
---
Wow, thanks for this. I had never heard of this style before.
---
What you can do is just set up a POS. 
---
They dont take long to setup and can serve as an operating base and importantly, its somewhere to retreat to.
---
Would like to point out they are actually in order and correct in game 😜
---
Wingspan just use cloaky ships and live in them, they dont bring anything but a refit with them.
---
F for one bazillion EHP bait brick proteus
---
We're creating the first Dyson Sphere, but instead of capturing energy from a star it's capturing memes from the planet.
---
Maybe call it a Dickson Sphere.
---
The broken thing about citadels is that you cant remote rep them ... so you cant drop triage to rep them while the enemy is shooting it. Currently if the enemy throws enough bodies at the citadel it just dies.
---
Would you like to place an order? 😏
---
Don’t knock it... Elo is busy wheeling fleets and providing nice target practice
---
Just burn to the gate, ez
---
That's a good idea, thank you. We originally planned to go for T3's, but they are sooo expensive, then we noticed that T2's are almost as good for half the cost. We never really compared anything to the faction ships.
---
Why not take back control so he doesn't take that decade with him?And perhaps I should start writing down some of Brave's adventures, good idea.
---
What might also be interesting to see is if it was "Alpha accounts only, creation date of (insert announcement date here) or later, no injectors."
---
Just to also say "hey thinking about Eve? Here's what you can do on the trial!"
---
Fractal Industries doing what they do best.
---
Always those niche play styles in EvE haha, just seems like CCP keeps killing them off as of late.
---
&gt;from a game dev perspective
---
Fucking lmao
---
Thank you!

GachiHYPER ??
---
They are already making a Vampire: the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 game, a singleplayer RPG by the looks of it, coming out in 2020.
---
However the World of Darkness MMO dream that some people wanted, will never come out, unless Paradox sells the license to another publisher willing to do it. Because Paradox themselves have no interest in making an MMO.
---
Can't even burn to gate, instant webs and neuts....
---
there is a special geometry to the number 9 when playing eve which i won't bother explaining
---
Thanks! We'll be going for BC's and BS's eventually. Cruisers are just the first step. My end game is being able to fly Black Ops, but that's a long way away and I may end up choosing another path.
---
Top belt, Amamake. Ask nicely in local and you can have as much solo PVP as you want.
---
Except at the moment there is pretty much a hard limit. It's just fairly high at 35 anoms at Mil Index 5 + the odd random spawns.
---
dude the answer is easy its the |Jove|
---
brain explodes
---
Yeah because a noob is going to go train Shield Management V right away. And everybody needs Warp Drive Operation V!
---
Confession: I trained Warp Drive Operation V just to be at Shuttle Mastery V.
---
I wonder whether EVE 2.0 would maybe have a real chance. A lot of people would leave, but i think theres also a lot of people that would try it because that wall of "that game is so old and i will never able to compete with veterans" (yes i know that isn't a massive problem in EVE, but many people who never played don't know that and didn't test it either).  
---
The problem is that a new attempt would go down the drain too if the current problems don't get fixed in that new version. And I somewhat doubt CCP knows all the problems since i think we don't know all of them either. Sure there are some obvious bullet points but theres propably much more to it.
---
Merc corps arent a thing anymore? They used to be common.
---
Man, you must be really salty to call in your buddies and push my comment to the bottom so fast. lol
---
Just fly cheap ships and accept that you'll a lot of them to the blob.
---
Solo pvp in eve is rarely done because it's very difficult, but it can be very rewarding.
---
Whatever you do don't solo because someone pressured you to do it. Only do it if you like it - you probably won't like it, not many people do.
---
The bigger issues is that citadels are so cheap that why do you care about losing it?
---
just keep proving me right
---
I dont know what krabs can and cant do these days, maybe you'd be better at this
---
One of the things that would make the game healthier in the long run is to force people to spread out all over the galaxy. This can be achieved by nerfing ihub upgrades in order to decrease the amount of anomalies available in a region.
---

---
Vexors and VexorNIs are always going to be good. Same with Omen Navy Issue, Osprey Navy.
---
Once you get more money, Ashimmu and rail Vigilant is a nice combo. I say rails on the Vigi only because brawling is a good way to get caught and die.
---
But it's a lot of strong, ranged webs in two ships, especially if you go fac web on the Vigi or get a good roll on an Abyssal. And keep in mind that the effectiveness bonus makes even a weak/cheap abyssal roll pretty good on the vigi.
---
Night I understand that, but if actual people in New Eden are using those measurements wouldn't they wonder where they came from?
---
Your posting is as clueless as your leadership.
---
What game have you developed that has had more than 1000 players and successfully run for more than 6 months?
---
Come find my arbitrator please :)
---
The number of viable play styles has been dwindling for years, unfortunately.
---
Lots of people explaining different ways to get tackled, and some ways to avoid that, but nobody mentioned the [Cloak Trick](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_Trick) (I think you need Omega to do this, and there is some training involved). I've escaped bubbles with it in a T1 frigate.
---
Some people mentioned the [Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Magic_14), without explanation.
---
Consider bookmarking [this page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page), and refer to it when you need to learn something about game mechanics in Eve.
---
Are we really suprised CCP implemented a half baked fucked up War Mechanic?
---
True enough
---
I especially appreciated a reference to their... famous... caracals.
---
This game are probably rated in Gs still because that’s probably what a unaugmented person is most adapted to.
---
&gt;So the question is, why haven't CCP made Eve 2.0 yet?
---
You are making a pretty big assumption that the player base would actually enjoy the idea of migrating towards this new universe.
---
The main reason why older players still play eve online, the time they invested in the game, it means something.
---
It represents decades of history and work for them. A new game would give those vets the excuse to finally let go of their hobby. 
---
It may also attract new players, of course, a common argument of new players who end up quitting is that they believe they will never be able to "catch up" with the veterans. So a brand new universe starting from point 0 would attract those players. But ultimately, what you are asking is a for CCP to make a giant gamble, and when your entire company depends on a single product, gambling the future of said product in a all or nothing situation is not the wisest business decision to be doing.
---
Biggest game I worked on was League of Legends back in the day. Biggest project I was on was the jungle rework when feral flare and all that stuff was removed. This is an odd question because there are a ton of devs out there, its not exactly an elite job. If I claimed to a senior dev or something I would understand your scrutiny. The barrier of entry in the field tbh is not as bad as people may think it is. CCP is actually a really good example, because of the location it really hard for them to even get devs because alot of people do not want to move to iceland.
---
I agree.
---
Your point?
---
TBH I do not really see the benefits of the new moon system though. It is exactly the same as all other mining now just the rocks are called something different and have different uses.
---
Useful and insightful comment.
---
Ayyy lmao
---
Yet you still reply to them?
---
It was a question to quantify the dev perspective statement. Not aggressive, just informative. Answer was better than anticipated.
---
I had good memories of it
---
Yeah but the vets complain that the single core nature of the code limits what we want to do (dreads are useless in titan fights instead of killing one titan every gun volley). 
---
And maybe there could be a way to transfer some of our effort to the new galaxy.
---
Buy back is a fraction of the income though, which ultimately comes down to my point that there is virtually no way for a new alliance to bust out on the scene and be impactful.
---
Hard Knocks Bot broke.
---
the fact you paid for it is stupid, its not like there were big secrets revealed
---
This is such an incoherent rambling mess. I hope you have an easier time gathering and presenting your thoughts in your day to day.
---
I think that CCP has learned alot, and that eve 2.0 will be pretty good. One of the issues with deving a game like eve is that it is so old and it is single universe so it is very difficult to make a meaningful change that would not fuck it. That is why most of the posts like this are bad ideas, because there is no way to implement them.
---
Ahh, all good!
---
Darwinism at ita finest
---
I ultimately agree, but it can be lessened to a degree. Stopping the sale of extractors for irl money which will make injectors finite, combined with preventing supers/titans from docking would curb the situation greatly, but the damage has been done and it will never be fixed entirely.
---
Of course. I just wanted to put a few points out there.
---
Having veto power over CCP's game development direction is pretty sweet.
---
I can't speak for what exactly it does, but I can give some background on ESI.
---
The ESI endpoint that returns market orders only includes ranged buy orders from structures.  To see sell market orders in a structure you have to make an authenticated request to each structure to get orders within that structure.
---
What's probably happening is it has a character on the backend that is used to query the orders from a static list of the more popular structures.  But since that character doesn't necessarily have access to _EVERY_ structure, you cannot display them all.
---
Its not gameplay that forms mega coalitons we do that.   You can say well x mechanic is why no we as people make those choices.
---
And trying to help Test during the fountain War, although they were so useless as to be beyond anyone's help.
---
where do i sign up for this
---
No, but it's gameplay that dictates how coalitions interact with each others.
---
Try Velator and report back what dropped on you. Or try Enyos in Catch
---
On par with the OP thb
---
GOTG days are numbered for sure
---
Nah I'm good, the people that stayed can make their own choices
---
lol. someones salty about losing two systems last night

What is the point of this post??
---
&gt; Faction Mining laser upgrades, requiring 10-20% less CPU 
---
Whew lad, this would make tanking about 1000x easier. 
---
&gt; Faction Freighters giving 15% boost to warp speed
---
I like the idea of faction freighters, but +15% warp speed isn't compelling enough. 
---
However, I would totally go for **+50% warp acceleration**. With freighters the low warp speed isn't as big of a killer as the extremely slow speed up/slow down in warp. 
---
Improving the acceleration would have just as important of a benefit as raising the ship's warp speed limit and it would combine beautifully with either using the low-slot warp speed mods or with the ascendancy implant set.
---
grr gons, bad gons.
---
When living in wh space you can close wormholes by moving mass through, doing this means you can keep your whole somewhat inaccessible while crabbing
---
I suppose INIT didn't become a goon pet so they could shit all over everyone, and before goons HBC?

I guess Doom will never end up invading Catch?

Magic 8 Ball says: No

Loxyrider made some of best eve videos ever
---
Not semantics, just basic maths you cretin.
---
You're arguing against my use of the term opportunity cost and not the actual subject at hand. Ironically, you trying to chastise me just proves my point more. Let me know when you're ready to discuss  how making the new top tier ship in the game even more accessible and cheaper improves the meta despite making subs even more useless.
---
wut? I thought dreads were significantly more expensive.. like 50-100% expensive..
---
A poverty fit carrier is like 1.2-1.3 bil, no?
---
If you can't fly an interceptor, get an Arron. Fit a 5mn mwd, inertial stabilizers in the low slots, hyperspatial rigs, and whatever shield tank your skills allow you to fit in the mid slots with your skills. Add a cloak if you can. Unless they have a remote sensor boosted daredevil camp, you should be able to get through.
---
So are we rewriting history? Woe is PL! They were always the little guy, the underdog. Why oh why does everyone pick on them!
---
farewell detta bae
---
Or hire less designers for spaceship dress-up and hire more coders?
---
Ah yes, the slaved cyno algos.
---
You are so wrong dude  
---
Ogres are thermal heavy combat drones
---
Gottem
---
I'm actually extremely left wing you can check my post history
---
Yeah we essentially dive in with ships ammo and refits to meet all our customers needs, some people will move a suitcase filled with ships around to have multiple options open to them, if you need more information please feel free to chat us up in WING-DS in game :)
---
Nova is not dead *yet* but this is till funny and true
---
They ran out of steam
---
Which has nothing to do with PL's play style, which is what is the current discussion
---
I mean good one and everything but they have done this in HS long enough to know how to get a pod out.
---
Make sure all security types are ticked off in settings
---
Well we've killed their pods before so it can be done, and it can be done easily since MCAV can do it
---
Yea, YouTube is what people watched...
---
Each of the "homeworlds" humanity spent thousands of years on during EVE's dark age in lore would have different levels of gravity, and the people living on each planet would have adapted to those gravities. Each empire would probably have its own measurement!
---
But some of the problems won’t be fixed by a new dev.  They don’t change fozziesov because they can’t do it technically, they don’t do it because they can’t come to an agreement on what to do about it. I’d easily bet they’ve spent more time trying to figure out what to do about fozziesov then they actually spent developing it. Designing a game is hard.
---
A capital alt might be a good end goal, but I think a worthy starting point is an orca, since its pretty easy to train into
---
Many people (including myself) have stopped running T5s until this site is removed from the rotation for this reason.
---
It gives access to moon ores to line members, and lets newer pilots get in on the action. It makes moon mining a lot easier to interdict since you don't need to destroy the structure to keep the moon goo from flowing, you just have to shoot the miners. It requires actual engagement instead of just picking up moon goo every few days.
---
Theomacy was a player run battle Royal that was really fun
---
I appreciate your answer, but I honestly suspect a level of sarcasm in light of your "Torpedo Delivery System". Reaching out to talk to Wingspan, especially in a discussion about a mobile base, feels like I'm asking to meet a mugger with a smile.
---
How many Americans ponder the derivation of their freedom units?

It's translated for our understanding. Why do you think everyone speaks your local language and writes in your script?

---
Being outnumbered 1000:1 in a subcap fight is just as bad odds as being outnumbered 1000:1 with supers involved. The only difference is which ships wind up on your killmail.
---
You know the New Eden Open with a Tournament before right? pretty sure last time it was marred with collusion and backroom deals
---
I didn't actually, but this is new so
---
lmfao this is great
---
Ok, obviously you can’t take everything t1 and down, neuts will murder a Hecate and so will a scramkiter. But other than neuts and maybe a blaster fit thorax, the Hecate can take pretty much anything
---
removing docking from Supers is not an idea I have heard before and is honestly one of the simplest and best ways to slow the super proliferation problem. Even if players can still inject up a new toon to coffin they still need to pay for that account with plex or IRL money which will limit how many they can have.
---
yep, thats how people think about any large entity w/ alot of power
---
Blasters, dual web, mwd, scram, 2mag stabs, DCU, ancil armor rep, and hull rigs.
---
Use ricardo next time
---
They shouldn't spawn at downtime or use the time of day as a feature of spawning, or it's unfair on people in later time zones. But the level of anomaly spawning and ISK printing is too high and they should keep nerfing the respawn rate.

Didn't pay attention the zeros in a contract?
---
You've already got a good answer to (1), and good answers for (2) up to a point, so let's talk *where* and let's talk *why*.
---
Where: All wormhole life depends on what class of hole you live in, and what its statics are.
---
If you live in a low class wormhole with a k-space static (C1-C3), then Astrahus farming is irrelevant, and any characters you add can be alphas whose sole purpose is to suicide out your k-space static to find that entrance in the event someone locks your main character(s) out of your home. There's no fixed number for how many you need. I would say you should have at least one, in case you get ganked and podded without a route back in but the hostiles aren't really trying to evict you. Any more than that gives you resiliency against eviction. Alternatively, if you plan to keep some valuable assets in your home, you can make one of these alphas a "lifeboat". Sit it in your citadel in a T1 hauler and forget about it. If you ever get evicted, pile your valuables into the lifeboat and log it off again or jump it out into k-space.
---
If you live in a high class wormhole (C5), it will be much easier for a hostile entity to take hole control and prevent you from getting a main back in. I'd keep 1-2 disposable alpha probers in case of accidents, but no more than that. It's not like you can take hole control back once you've lost it as a solo resident. Lifeboats are still relevant, but getting them to k-space in the face of hostile action will be much harder so you'd probably want to log them off and wait a week.
---
Why: Wormhole life is highly profitable, in spite of the fact that assets you keep in your home hole are vulnerable to getting blown up by an eviction. or other PVP activity. When thinking about what to keep in your home hole as a solo player, it's all about figuring out which threats you can repel, and which you can't. If a big corp decides to evict you... they're going to succeed. So it's useful to have spare characters around to save your small and valuable assets from destruction. If a small corp decides to evict you... they'll succeed if *and only if* they can prevent you from gunning your properly fit citadel. So having a spare gunner, or an alt whose only purpose is to get your main back into your hole, can be quite valuable. The emphasis is on "spare" here, because an eviction is sometimes preceded by your PVE ships getting ganked and podded, so characters that you're actively using may not be in your home hole when it is threatened.
---
CCP still protects the pirat bling T3 Proteus gankers and spits on the new players! Well done on the public PR that causees too \^\^
---
Pog
---
Be eve players
---
demand sov changes because dominion sov sucks
---
offer no thought out details or concepts to be implemented besides "help the little guy"
---
get fozzy sov and realize it sucks too
---
\*pichachu face\*
---
I think that ship has sailed a long time ago
---
I like idea of nerfing or even removing skill injectors. Where are gone old booster available only for new characters that you could use only for a few days after characters creation.
---
Is it a highly recognized ship? If I dipped through low or null would I just be asking for trouble? It seems a less expensive and less skill demanding ship as opposed to the carriers and dreadnoughts everyone is recommending.
---
if you go into low sec or null sec and want o be a nomad go for a carrier. if all you care about is high sec stick to an orca or a bowhead
---
The only specific example I remember being explicitly stated by the lore is the question of timekeeping. There's several Chronicles that touch on it but the tldr is that most of the colonies retained some fragments of the old earth calender even if they did not understand where it had came from. After the four Empires had met up they established it as a neutral method of timekeeping. I would imagine something similar could be used to explain the other sort of standards.
---
This ain't it chief
---
ITS NOT OGRE YET
---
Untill capsuleer clones where made, maybe they had history lessons on school. To have a less boring solution. The knowledge comes free of charge with your first clone. Unlike some other knowledge, like how to fly a cruiser class spaceship.
---
Is this worth a reddit thread
---
Absolutely
---
Until you show how this would work in russia speak, I can make no comment
---
I will not complain to be a good, or even competent, Stabber pilot.
---
+50% faster warp acceleration is OP boost, 15% faster is still amazing boost that can be enchanted with implants.
---
It was great until it was time to pay the prizes...
---
there is nothing of such mods in those lp stores
---
I mean we wouldn't specifically target anyone we just live nomadic lives so I was offering to give you a glimpse into the day to day, and if you're moving around looking for content it's not like you'd be easy to track down but that's up to you, just a friendly offer o7 best of luck
---
Use a better ship :)
---
Kind of. Plenty people in higsec still mine - there will be enough demand for those kind of upgrades for group of players willing to do those sites.
---
Yeah probably should have happened at the same time as rorqs
---
(tempted to fake rote kapelle flair so you visit those dumbasses more often)
---
I didn’t care about the prizes.  I just wanted a competitive pvp environment where it’s not just N+1 wins
---
As a chronic Serpentis pilot, you had me at blasters, dual web. Sold.
---
Nothing in your post comes across as from a "game dev's perspective" it's all just your usual crying on reddit. Just thought it was cute that you threw that in there as if it were some badge of credibility.
---
I mean, that's probably a better decision that being honest when admitting to people that INIT is your boogeyman.
---
I appreciate the offer and I apologize for my skepticism.
---
Tracking Computer.  TRACKING COMPUTER!
---
TBH A ceptor alt is an easy train. same with a backpack. Not needed but easy to train.
---
This just seems like someone who hasn't actually done much pvp complaining on behalf of reddit posters who claim that solo is dead and impossible
---
Wait they shut that down?
---
Structure bashing also leads to little rewards thanks to asset safety (inb4 wormholes). That alongside it taking waaaaay longernandnbeing way easier to soam. People kinda lost interest. There are several wars that are raging stem and pretty solid ones at that so...
---
This is one of the reasons I have stopped running abyssal sites.  Just seems like a matter of time before the spawn from hell kills you. 
---
The isk/h now feels kinda low for the bling put in significant risk.
---
Is that where red frog hangs out?
---
He aint wrong
---
Their apparently working on project Nova now.. but I stopped paying attention to ccp right after they cancelled legion.
---
Is nova the shitty mobile game?  And Legion was the dust successor right?
---
They are a nuisance that kills krabs, but would rather self-destruct their fleet, than take an ever-so-slightly disadvantageous fight. A proper fighter who comes in with a warning, leaves krabs alone when he gets a gudfite, takes it, and doesn't bring TEST-level shittalk with him - always welcome, allowed to withdraw after the white flag is waived, and respected. Init is literally none of the above, and probably at the same level as SMA. Not respected.
---
Possibly having some other incurred penalty for losing a super or tian is needed. Possibly place a penalty on the production side to stem the flow of Titans and supers from the larger alliances something like the jump reactivation timer but for building supers might work in leu of SP loss. 
---
Also I really want to see the subsytem mechanic expanded.
---
EHhhhh once you run some numbers it's honestly not as op as it looks at first glance, which is why I went with +50% over my first instinct of +25%. 
---
Freighters warp slowwww with it taking about 19 seconds to get into and out of warp. So 50% faster warp acceleration only saves you at most roughly 13 total seconds per system or per jump, assuming no other mods or implants used. 
---
I calced the time for warp acceleration with [the simplified formula](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Warp_time_calculation) of `ln 149,597,870,700 / 1.37`. My numbers could be wrong as I'm not accustomed to digging this deep into eve mechanics, but I've hauled a *lot* and these numbers seem right to me.
---
Also remember, capsuleers are a higher class than most residents. I imagine the capsul UI fits the capsuleer's understanding. And you're a capsuleer.
---
Are you sure that they are gone? Afaik they just arent displayed in the agency but are still around
---
I’m a bit out of the loop. Are they seriously working on a fucking mobile game?
---
Halo is coming to PC at least. I see that coming out loooooong before legion
---
You need to solo pvp like Simple Farmers
---
The true solo experience is having a reaponse fleet show up and use more in ammo and bubbles to get you than your entire fit cost.
---
Oh look another worm... Another garmur- oh there's a smartbombing battleship on the novice in gate... Oh another empty system
---
Something that we can all put aside our differences to cheer for.
---
you'd think one wouldn't speak on things he himself claims to not know about eh
---
Strat fits?
---
you should kill yourself
---
I agree, the new icons are fucking awful.
---
And the freighter/jump freighter alt someone needs to move all that shit
---
One thing that is not mentioned 
---
Size of alliances...
---
Back when I started to play the game, 2009, we had multiple alliances and coalitions. Most where between 1500 - 3500.
---
Today we have Imperium, TEST &amp; co, PanFam and Fraternity. Anyone else either live by there grace or are full of said alliances alts. 
---
Limit corp and alliance size. 
---
Alliance flavour “vanilla” is now almost the only flavour new players will try.
---
Or he underpriced a sale on market, and the useless alerts didn’t pop up (but they did for the 137100000% overage on the other 40 properly priced items)
---
Small groups would have a significantly easier time killing things as umbrellas get spread much thinner.
---
Though, I do like his idea.
---
The fact you paid for it was funny.
---
Ok, thanks
---
And only 20 real people playing.
---
Yea faction is better in a lot of instance, cost wise at least.
---
 T3s are the shit tho like loki is top dog you wont kill it without help. But from a pvp perspective almost everything is "viable" try battleships its hilariously fun. Even t1 stuff but judging by your post youve done the t1 stuff.
---
I'd have played it.  The idea of Dust was pretty cool and it had so much potential but was so pointless being on Playstation and that's it.
---
Yup... there are very few real solo pvpers in the game. They would rather use 5 accounts then lose learn to solo at the risk of losing a frig
---
What the fuck are drooling about? You claimed PL were the biggest entity when that's never been true.
---
Not bad, but still falling short of Darwinism's meme game. They set the bar pretty high for Khanid country.
---
For moving stuff in highsec and the occasional lowsec system with cloak + mwd i love my orca. But if ypu arent going in highsec, a carrier would work a lot better. Noones gonna hunt a regular carrier cynoing around in lowsec, null might be more sketch w bubbles but you can get around safely enough if you are smart.
---
Members get rich themselves as well.  Not all of us are special snowflakes that expect our alliance to pay for everything.  
---
New moon mining creates far more player engagement than the old system.  What is lacking is a meaningful way for an alliance to profit off its ownership of moons using in game tools (reprocessing taxes basically do not work in my experience).
---
You are exactly the people who think they are eleet but really.... nope.
---
"who knows Ian, this mite be my new movie"
---
It's a slow burn. Can't just break out the endgame content otherwise there's nothing to improve upon. Don't want to peak too early lel
---
Can SMA just stay ded plz
---
I've been on the receiving end of PLs playstyle more times than you think.
---
CCP's WoD MMO seemed to have new teaser footage every year and yet they'd keep reworking on the same bullshit and not actually get anywhere toward a release.  I was really looking forward to a new WoD game and their cancellation is part of why I quit Eve.  In any case my point is just because theyre's some basic play demo doesn't mean Star Citizen will go anywhere, but I hope it does.
---
As another example I've been watching Camelot Unchained for a few years because I'm tempted to try something that might be as good as DAoC, but I doubt it and their progress is slow.  Entered alpha in early 2015, which pushed back their initial beta timeline by 3 years.  I'm glad they didn't just keep pushing through a shitty game, but it finally went beta July of last year and it's still going nowhere fast.  If I knew it would become decent I'd totally put a few hundred into it right now to support it, but as someone that has never pre-ordered any game it's just a hard sell on what could very well be disappointment.
---
The zoomers lost all integrity, they cant handle a lose so they cant learn
---
I stated, it's a fact, that they had the largest capital and super cap force. They, as part of the long standing partnership with NC and all ex bobites. Perhaps you need a calming laxative, you seem a little off.
---
Hi NC
---
yep https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6BcQtszj0
---
+ 1 to nomen nosprey scifi. Great ships
---
No, please. 
---
There's a lot of market content stemming from people rushing through orders and adding or skipping a zero. I still remember finding a fucked up battleship contract as a newbro and how excited I was to double my income out of nowhere.
---
Of course now I've been around long enough to have fucked up a few orders, myself. What goes around comes around, fair's fair. I hope a newbro bought those orders too.
---
They insta-locked and popped a ceptor of mine last week, I was just trying to travel through, I was really surprised.
---
I didn't check much, but people who got the killmails from their E-Uni structure fight (three Guardians killed out of five present, the eight Leshaks, Proteus, and Legion all survived) said that the fits were actually pretty bad for something so expensive. Like they prioritized having a blingy fit over having a good fit.
---
&gt;In fact, given that empires were isolated from each other for extended periods of time it seems likely each would have their own standards of measurement.
---
That being said, the empires are not all monolithic either. Even if you were to develop a local measurement system, the moment you ran into another population who also probably adapted their own system, the need for a transferable system becomes clear again.
---
[The scientific article on FTL travel](https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/scientific-articles/interstellar-traveling) it mentions that the Amarr (the first to re-discover FTL technology) found a mostly-intact gate:
---
&gt;Once the Amarr Empire had reached the technology level were it could enter space, it started to vigorously chart their home system. Due to technological limitations this survey took a long time. Finally, the Amarrians stumbled upon the remains of a jump gate at the outskirts of their solar system.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;By studying the remains, which were more or less intact, the Amarrians were able to garner enough information to build a jump gate of their own.
---
It is not too much of a stretch to assume that this ancient tech was all built, programmed, and operated from some unified system (metric in this case). Hard to avoid that stuff as you explore/reverse engineer old pre-EVE-gate-collapse ruins and salvage. 
---
While it possible that the Amarr could have eventually swapped back to their native system, there really isn’t a point if the one you have does what you need it to do. I imagine that for a while, AU’s, G’s, and the like we’re probably considered measurements of the well-travelled and elite space-farers of the day.

Wait, Project Legion is officially kill?
---
Wrong alliance
---
Yeah, it really does feel like being a banker in Germany just before WW2, the amount of zeros can make ya dizzy.
---
WoD was bought by Paradox, so CCP has nothing to do with it anymore.
---
Ahhh DAoC...lurved it as a smite cleric until they nerfed us hoping we would become healers instead. Then I made a Paladin and guess who didn't get determination to help overcome the statue state in pvp? Paladins. So I loved that game but also hated it.
---
There used to be groups who lived like that. Pretty much all of them are either dead or dying. 
---
So good luck.
---
Outch! 
---
It s better to put some tank at least if you get disconnected.
---
&gt; plenty of people do "true solo" PvP.

there are literally dozens of us!

it says a lot about your experience that a link backpack wasnt even mentioned but a "bait t3 alt"(???????) was

or just not implement the above change
---
war hqs are retarded
---
You mean the diplo's who more often than not talk outside of Eve via things like Discord?
---
Do you have any insight to what killed that way of life?
---
how dare you have fun in this video game! get back into your pre-fit heavy assault cruiser, anchor up, and shoot, turn on/off your propulsion module, and tank modules when the FC tells you to!
---
Diplomacy is the most important thing in the game ... and they'll be hunting you anyway, as soon as you and yours hit your first target.
---
You have a community of interests. Talk to them.
---
This post is edgy and lame and clearly written by someone who doesn't know what solo pvp looks like
---
Maybe? Hard to say tbh.
---
I know what game I do not play anymore, like many others. Keep up with this mentality and you will not find anymore people to do your "PvP".
---
This is a good explanation, but it's unsatisfying to me. I find it hard to believe that the people of New Eden don't ponder where an AU comes from. I'm a resident of Earth and one of the first things I did when I started playing EVE was look up where an AU comes from. More than that, if AUs and Gs are in fact used by the people of New Eden, it serves as evidence of the existence of Earth.
---
Try all the things. Do more of what you find fun.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/ is your new best friend.
---
EvE University is still a thing. If you like nullsec, all the newbie-friendly alliances of Brave Newbies, Karmafleet, Pandemic Horde and Brand Newbros are good options.
---
If you like exploration, look out for Signal Cartel as well.
---
If you want to make hauling a thing, PushX and Red Frog are names you should look up.
---
To get to Solitude, you'll need to run thru some low-security space (ie 0.4 or worse), where Concord's already tissue-thin protection fades to nothing. Get yourself a maneuverable frigate that can get into warp quickly, and use Dotlan (or the in-game map's) ability to spot recent ship kills to identify gate camps ahead of your route.
---
Enjoy EvE. Remember, it's about fun per hour.
---
This is probably a bug, I've already filed a bug report, GM won't resolve these kind of issues
---
If you applied to a corp i would just wait for it to be processed and then they will tell you the next steps once you are accepted.
---
I would fit it just to make it more annoying to rf
---
I did look at that. But they are all ticked on by default. Deselecting them let all orders vanish.
---
The only non-npc stations i see are from tranquility and mogul :S
---
They would know they came from earth... I do not understand your question.
---
It doesn't really matter though. PIRAT have over 115 wars at the moment and any of those targets can shoot that structure, even if it isn't the HQ for their war.
---
There's still reason for groups at war with PIRAT to turn up and shoot it.
