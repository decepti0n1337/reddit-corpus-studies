It was a Linux/unix joke. "sudo" is a command prefix that means "super user do" for running something with root access.
---

---
In your post you meant "pseudo" (the Latin prefix for false) not "sudo".
---
---
---
I love these comments. Why would pay actors when I could easily just use an alt and then I don‚Äôt have to pay anyone. Use some logic.
---
That happened twice, lost 2 exploration herons and got paid more that it's value. One even let me loot my own ship so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Apologize. Apologize right now!
---
I played for a month about 6 years ago. I hustled and between mining and the market was able to scrape together enough isk for 1 Plex (back when it was worth a month of game time, before f2p). I did all of this solo and never joined a player owned Corp.
---
## Why I didn't sick around:
---
I was considering joining a player corp but my wife was pregnant. I reached the conclusion that either I back out now or jump down the largest rabbit hole I have ever seen. I walked away but I think the game is awesome and have enjoyed keeping tabs on it.

Honestly this is true almost all the time. But certain times of the year you can get a "deal" that is pretty much the same price as buying the parts individually but you don't have to assemble anything. Base prices on their products are just to lure people in when they have their "$1400 savings" which is actually just here have it at a reasonable price.
---
Thank you! Am I right in reading these that they're fit to shoot subcaps? Sorry for sounding like such a moron, I'm always super nervous about flying a new ship class.
---
its fucking terrible
---
Yeah i know. 
---
Eve may be the darkest of places but has greatest of people playing it.
---
No. No. And no. 
---
In that order.
---
Is there a RF while it's anchoring? I thought after it comes out of its 24hr anchoring invulnerability it's vulnerable to getting taken down to 0-hull and exploding.
---
You are pretty lucky i think, i got an 180m/h average profit over about 200 sites
---
That would be an interesting chat mechanic. WH bleed through or cross talk. Not sure how it would work, or if it's a good idea, but it would be interesting.
---
rip VNI, long love the domi (again)
---
 ‚òë Didn¬¥t spin the ships of his alts in Hangar
---
Never ran these sites, but thanks for taking the time to explain the investment vs profit. Might get into those one day
---
That pretty hilarious. I would have offered him the service of removing his bounty anytime he got one put on him so he could go back to rafting against the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù rats.
---
Again, your value judgement. Not mine. I do agree though.
---
We all get it, you are a very special person who can do wondrous things the rest of us can only dream of. We are not worthy to be in the same thread as you.
---
Why not just do fw missions in a jackdaw at this point lol. 0 risk massive isk/h.
---
Thanks!
---
I had difficulties seeing the risk/benefit at 300m/h, let alone 180m/h, thats pretty bad!  I do see though EVE has more pressing matters then balancing abyssal income. 
---
I think an ingame tool to filter out abyssal final items to make them easyer searchable and buyable, would go a long way to buff the sales of abyssal items and in turn the mutaplasmids (most of them seem to have lost alot of value).
---
Very well put together.
---
Pretty much this. Ask how they killed you, and ask how what you can do differently next time. 
---
Starry-eyed newbies with a [growth-mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU) turn into career PVPers.
---
So, SOE capital confirmed?
---
Chill out dude, this was a glorious victory for CODE. I forgot to put /s in there it seems.
---
Preferably bandwidth for 5 heavy drones!
---
Yeah that was kind of my point. Like to see a graph of people online once the changes happened.
---
Oh sir, I am the definition of chill. And you couldn‚Äôt be more right about the glorious victory in the name of our supreme protector, James 315.
---
Never fit t2 guns or capital mods. Fit poverty so when you explode, which you will, the killmail is tiny and you can field more dreads.
---
Am I retarded? Idgi
---
Don‚Äôt pay, just tank your ship.
---
Well... I just got killed and didn't get a pm but at least i got some isk
---
Nope, those are close range anti-cap fits. If you had a battleship bot moving, you might be able to hit it.
---
If you want to have a HAW dread (aka anti-subcap) you‚Äôd need quad pulse laser, and probably all tracking rigs + tracking drugs / implants. Having all these make you pretty sad against capitals though.
---
Google solo HAW revelation and pull find some youtube videos that have nice fits + show you how you might want to fly one.
---
Think the ring for the nestor was to make it easy to jettison dangerous cargo, or patients in quarantine that might need to...suddenly be removed from the ship
---
I've done all 3. Brave is ok but unexceptional. Horde is competently managed but the leadership are all condescending shitheads who hate their members. They provide an experience that's fine on a surface level but when you dig deeper the culture becomes extremely toxic.
---
Karmafleet is the only one worth joining.
---
It's not a full CCP experience until the logs show nothing.
---
Can I have your stuffs? :P
---
Find some friends, then find something you like doing and let it kill you.
---
tbh i think its fairly balanced, you get a similar income super ratting, which is worth 4 times the gila. To break even you have to farm like 40 hours. It is safer than abyssals if you live under an umbrella tho. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Only thing ccp should reconsider imo is replacing losses which happened due to server sided problems.
---
Low effort is rewarded in kind.

Thanks for the advice and the offer mate!

Give me a week or so to get the basics, grind the missions and I‚Äôll PM u when I put my stabilisers on to leave the station :)

&gt;never joined a player corp

---
Actually, Joining EVE University might be one of the best, first, moves you can make. Join their corp, they'll help you learn anything you're interested in. They're a very well respected training corp.
---
That makes sense, thank you!
---
Your right, it has russian pets as well.
---
Sounds like you guys had a lot of fun! Congrats! :)
---
Except for u/djKaktus :P
---
Don¬¥t let some reddit warriors spoil your fun!
---
Use a fort
---
Only if you want to use the moon drill! ;)
---
Come back some time if you have the opportunity mate, I can link you some newbro friendly corps to have join.
---
There have been many "actual PvPers" in CODE. over the years. Its not a meme. Its a fun alliance to be a part of, whether you're ganking or not.
---
Never too early to quit
---
I thought lore wise they tried and it didn't work, but it did affect the mass of the ship?
---
Man that's a great recruitment ad!
---
Always amazed at the stuff EvE players come up with. Still watch "Of fountains, clowns and birthdays" every now and again.
---
Delayed local ;)
---
I definitely tried to click the notification...
---
Same, put in a bug report but no response of course.
---
Ice and spod**
---
Yes it is
---
Oh I didn't know that, thanks!
---
Just to clarify,
---
As an alpha account (free to play) you cannot use the stealth bomber or a cloak at all.
---
Other than that welcome to cloaks online! CCP Falcon is over to your right handing them to everyone like Oprah. You get a cloak! And you get a cloak! Freighter? Fuck it you get one too! Have a co-op cyno too!
---
Didnt Somer Blink get banned for sharing GM communications?
---
You don't need PLEX to play, although PLEX/subscription gets you out of F2P restrictions. F2P gameplay if you start fresh should last you a few months before you even notice or care though tbh.
---
Stealth bombing is still at thing, yes. If anything it's at its prime right now with the nullsec blackout. There's also no-cloak stealth bomber Goku fleets which have become part of the blob meta, but that's probably not what you're asking.
---
I‚Äôm so proud
---
Fun fact:
---
They were also playing Rattlesnake self-destruct chicken while forming for PvE a few weeks prior?
---
Guess which CEO lost?
---
Imagine buying a modern alienware to run eve. Bro, the thing runs on a literal potato.
---
When my pc went down for updates and I could still hear battle comms on my phone, I turned the lights off and sat in the dark for a while. Really reflected on things, like my own mortality and how much of a bad idea it is to gate a damnation through low sec.
---
That was beautiful.
---
It truely is a mystery that saying something dumb attracts downvotes
---
Ice and spite...  perfect description, lol
---
keep in mind that ab quit the game, so dont expect much from him posting
---
I can confirm this is a thing. I use to work as a GM, I will of course redact my GM name although I am sure by now it would be fine to release it considering this was way back in 2013-2014.
---
I no longer work for CCP but I can shed some light on this wonderful feature!
---
My primary job outside of standard duties of GMing was to reach out to newer players, generally we would send out a somewhat personalized in-game email, of course the base email was script like but we could customize it best to our abilities to inform players of helpful features in game and to hand out an offer of helping with simple issues that they might not be able to figure out and hopefully lead them to a path of playing the game longer. Of course a retention program makes sense especially in a game like EVE, a lot of players quit due to the game being somewhat complicating to a beginner, the more they understand at the start, the more likely they are to stick around longer. I have had some interesting conversations while employed as a GM, and met a lot of interesting people, so many people were thankful for the reach out and the help they received. 
---
Also, during my downtime, I would mine on my other computer while working, it was nice earning isk in eve while working... I will say this, though you never know who you are flying with as you could be ganged up with a GM, our identities are supposed to be secret from our normal accounts for obvious reasons.
---
that's literally how i got into pvp
---
Not long after I started this game I got blapped in a firetail outside an npc null station.  I actually asked the guys if I could practice on them and they said sure, they didn't mind a bunch of firetail killmails.  So I spent about about an hour undocking firetail after firetail and futilely trying to kill one of them.  Was a lot of fun and I got some decent feedback.  You just never know with this game.  Some people are dicks, but a lot really aren't.
---
It's in the "June 2019" Patch notes. They're usually grouped into 1 month blocks. So even though it technically occurred in July, it's in the June block of notes.
---
No opinion on the corp in question, just wanted to say that the economic metrics mentioned in the video perfectly illustrate how broken the game economy has become over the years.
---
I was the proteus pilot, that fortizar was really kicking the shit out of my poor ‚ÄúFUCKULATOR 9000‚Äù (Ships name), helped to have my guardian alts watching him to make sure he warped out safe. 10/10 fight though would do again
---
Ooooohhhh that clears that up. Thanks! What a weird way to release patch notes. Personally I like it when each download I make has it's own tab.
---
Yep, I live in a c4 3/5 static. We have a couple citadels including a fortizar. One other thing that helps out is if we get a bad connection we can do what‚Äôs called rolling the hole where we put massive ships through until the hole collapses due to too much mass.
---
Friday night rage rolling for fights. Good times.
---
In other games dealing with bads is time I could spend getting better so you're literally wasting my time by sucking so much.
---
In eve we are all bads anyway. o7
---
Fantastic change
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78024611/

Legacy code. Didn't want that sov anyway.
---
Why goodbye? It‚Äôs a lot better of a ship this way, more of a ‚Äúhello there‚Äù.
---
Nice man, I am also new to Eve. Have yet to encounter this! Lucky you!
---
\&gt; What a weird way 
---
:ccp:
---
I'd like to see your fit too. From your video it seems to do pretty well even against that leshak nuet combo early on
---
I dont know much about the company do they do strange things usually?
---
There's shitposts... then there's this
---
Welcome. Here's a little something to get you started:
---
[https://www.thealphasguide.com/](https://www.thealphasguide.com/)
---
It includes a chapter with advice on wormhole diving/daytripping (the practice of visiting wormhole to farm some loot, as opposed to staying there more or less permanently) and surviving the experience. It's a risky endeavour with good payouts for brand new players. If you make a good haul, your loot will buy you 10 more ships like the one you initially used to get in there, so you can keep doing it and even dying without too much fear of running out of funds.
---
For anything else you might need help with, you can check [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
Don't get attached to ships or assets, don't get too greedy and take huge risks, don't risk what you can't afford to lose and find/make a few buddies to play with (or recruit real life friends, it's even better). The game is more enjoyable if you have a group of people to play, either more experienced guys to show you the ropes or other newbies to learn through disastrous failures as a team.
---
A lot of people will tell you to join one of the big alliances and move to null security space as soon as possible (they all have corporations that accept and teach new players) but i'd advise you against it initially.
---
I don't have anything against them and they do a good job of integrating new players into the game, but you will be locked into a very specific playstyle from very early in your eve life.
---
Instead, get your feet wet and experience more of what the game has to offer. Lowsec, faction warfare, nullsec roaming and small scale PvP, industry and trading, wormhole space, etc. The list of available "professions" is huge (see a breakdown here: [https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg](https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg) )
---
Once you know what you're getting into and if you think the nullsec lifestyle is for you, then sure, go ahead and apply to join one of them. But try out other stuff too before you make up your mind. The game is huge in terms of what you can do, both in terms of fun activities and in terms of ingame "jobs" that will fund that fun.
---
good guys post again
---
Wow...well made
---
Plus I sometimes think its them checking for bots.
---
Your use of the tactical overlay is what finally helped me get into flying solo. I've been a F1 monkey for nearly my entire Eve career. I attempted flying kiting ships for a bit but would always ram into the enemies scram range or lose point and then end up not getting the kill.
---
I started using the top down approach and I'm finally getting to the point where I understand where ships are and where they are going in reference to me. Scored lots of nice kills so far!
---
Just wanted to say thank you and keep up the great videos.
---
Never thought about this before, can a Nyx boost his own support fighters with skirmish command burst and increase fighter warp disruption range?
---
Does armor or shield command affect them as well?
---
Yeah, not all of it bad at all (don‚Äôt listen to everyone on here). But some of the stuff ccp does is head scratching. 
---
Such as idk nerfing cap jump ability, and then adding in mechanics that circumvent those restrictions.
---
No mad.
---
They do strange things only.
---
Thank you. Everybody here is now stupidier having read this.
---
Hey, good points here. When you were chaining through wormholes harvesting gas, did you use ninja mining (leaving when npcs spawned)? And I agree with the trade volumes, lots of researching needed
---
Aside from its insane pricepoint did the Gila recieve nerfs? (wasn't playing for half a year)--
---
Wow, lucky. This has only happened to me once in Eve.
---
Please nothing chat related. Can‚Äôt keep the current version working correctly. Lol
---
Today they pushed the changes to the Vexor Navy Issue(VNI), and a change to the alpha skill set.
---
I remember losing my first retriever shortly after purchase. Begged the guy to spare me and I offered him all the isk in my wallet (was only like 3mill at the time because I was on the struggle bus) which he declined and proceeded to blow me up.
---
I was so bummed until I got 40mill and a "best of luck, I just wanted the kill mail" message. Inspired me to learn more about how to not die...
---
Yea found the patch notes finally lol. Just wasnt expecting them to be in the June update section.
---
If you lose dps you might wanna stop shitfitting it. (Or get some better skills). Also its cap is the same as before, you just get a bonus to said reps.
---
Dumb in your opinion. I cannot guess what events that have shaped your life and lead you and others to consider other people's opinions as "dumb" and "retarded" and other such bigoted terms.
---
I cannot relate to the inability to explore others opinions, empathize with them, and see if those relate to, or change your own. Instead of being an intelligent being one instead chooses to hide (by down voting) the thoughts of others that are not like them.
---
Do GM still contact new players? I absolutely loved taking to them in the newbie chat. Had one show me the ropes on ship components way in the day
---
I agree. If I was new to the game or had never played this would definitely make me interested in KF.
---
That being said, I didn't even get most of the memes, and I play the game. Is Goon meme-culture that divergent from Test/Brave/r/Eve?
---
Very interesting. I've made about 10 billion thanks to the abyss but i haven't yet been in a site on the live server (i was just station trading abyssal loot in jita).
---
In fact i just started experimenting with a few fits on the test server yesterday.
---
Would you say it's better to just stick to tier3s, add just a bit of bling to make the tank safer (half a billion to one billion fit) and blitz more of them per hour for a safer income?
---
&gt;  but another group of players belonged to an alliance whose bio had a "best hits" of aggrieved responses, including one from CCP telling them not to spam the chat so much.
---
Hi there, that would be us.
---
Good ideas, sneaky is always good. Do people really check reaction indexes to bash structures? Seems like a c1 would offer more protection in that respect.
---
This is a lot of effort just to bait someone
---
I tried my first wormhole earlier this week in an Imicus. While hacking some dude uncloaked, pinned  and podded me. All I could do is put a :( in chat. He donated 10M after

|-|-|-|-|
---
Given the direction ccp is headed in i dont think i have seen a better period to start eve.
---
Give this man a hand, i heard there are spares lying around.
---
Im legit dying for a cynabal cross section image thing.
---
best video since your mother got pregnant with you, delicate cancer
---
How far can it apply? And remember drones can easily be defanged.
---
When the game is only full of PVPers and there is no more mining due to the miners are leaving the game, then you people will bitch. My brother and a few others have already left the game for this was the worst thing a null sec miner has seen. Why risk a cap mining ship to PVPers where the miners have no chance? As i am shutting down my two accounts, just realize that when prices go up due to less ore and the number of pilots online drops.... all you PVPers are to blame. Not everyone can replace cap miners on a continuous bases and been in the game for 10 plus years to suck up the losses. Been fun while it lasted but this one change has many of us leaving the game. Before you say good riddance, just remember it was you that wanted this rule change.
---
Yea I've noticed in terms of profit, the c5/c6 holes have the best sites for gas/reactions. Too bad their logistics are so awful.
---
As opposed to your low effort "ur dumb" bigot post? Look up the word bigot. Try it on like a hat and see if it fits. If your actually self introspective you may find on some ways you are. Maybe you want to strive to be the person you want to be instead of what you present to the world.
---
Or maybe you want to be another "ur dumb" mouth breather. I have no idea.
---
Shifted some of the dmg from drones to turrets
---
The simple fact that Titans are such as massive, massive force multiplier make them almost impossible to balance. You simply cannot have a game where a single player is able to destroy strategic-level fleets by himself, if only he has enough $$ behind him, and also try to "balance" fights. It's just not possible.
---
The only way this "balance issue" could be solved, would be to completely neuter Titans/caps in specific roles, and make sub-caps \*required\* to defeat other sub-cap fleets.
---
This will never happen, however, due to all of the sunk cost everyone has in their "i-win" capital/titan fleets. Can you imagine the salt that would happen if a group of 5-10 sub-caps could kill a lazy titan player? And that's still a 5-10x force multiplier!
---
There is no game besides eve that allows players to have such a huge advantage simply based on the cost of their equipment/ship.
---
Some of the RP can be entertaining, at least.  I'd imagine a fair bit of the hostility comes from their habit of ganking three day old newbros.
---
Very good advertising! Really makes me want to join Karmafleet later haha. Too bad I can‚Äôt, their recruiter hates me for some reason :(
---
Game master*
---
A tech 2 Tristan would be nice...
---
I started playing eve when you were 6 years old
---
I was the sender of this once, nuked a guys dragoon in FW, he raged and left. Came back after a few minutes and apologized so I then threw him some isk and taught him what D-Scan was.
---
Still hoping I die to him someday, then the cycle will be complete :D
---
Also, fun fact, the Nestor can NOT fit a covops cloak
---
Sounds like it's time for you to finally win eve. ;)
---
They never removed the rule, they implied they have never banned anyone for it.
---
Playing Eve is like starting college. Freshman year is wild and full of new experiences, then you have to stay up until 4am studying and working but you‚Äôre in too deep to stop. But also like college, it‚Äôs completely worth it and you makes a lot of cool friends along the way.
---
&gt;This week, null is literally dead ...
---
&gt;I've been watching other regions on dotlan, space is dead outside of the regions with super umbrellas. There are no hotspots anywhere else. What the hell.
---
&gt;...they are also finding space is dead?

Do not expect to stay in the game long term if you play alone. This game is 100x better with other people. We want you to stay, so follow our advice on this. Find a corp that is ACTIVE and do w/e is required to join them. 
---
Just so you know, once you start trying to join decently competent corps you should expect the hiring process to be every bit as involved and time consuming as finding a RL job. Some corp applications I've filed are probably even worse then RL applications. 
---
GL. I'll kill you if I see you though.
---
500% drone hp to 250%
---
It‚Äôs been extremely disappointing, I did 3 4-hour sessions looking for the gate in the past week and had nothing. I did get extremely lucky on the most recent try and actually had 3 fights, one against a Gila, and 2 against the Ikitursa.
---
In good Alliances and Corporations you will find fittings on their websites or external forums. Some Corporations safe fittings so you can search for them ingame and have them besides your fitting tool. They're usually fitted for PvP tho so if you wan't to rat with a Dread you need to think about a fit for yourself.
---
Dreadnoughts can be fitted very differently, HAW guns + tracking vs subcaps, capstable double rep, baittank against solo Supers or Titans or just the usual trow-away fit for a Dreadbomb *pewpew...*
---
Usually Dreads are used to waste them dropping other capitals and "suicide gank" them. You will most often suicide because after entering Siege you're a sitting duck and are an easy killmail for their capitalumbrella response.
---
Tho without knowing wich PvP situation you're striving to encounter we cant help you.
---
Anyways Dreadnoughts in PvE can work too if you're able to clear certain sites within its 5min Siege cycle. You need to look up wich sites in your region have trigger to excalate many waves at once. Ideally you allways want to shoot and while shooting allready lock the next target. So sites where you need to clear the entire wave before the next one spawns is a big nono.
---
Dreadnoughts in PvE are excessive sniping platforms, you warp into the site at 100-70km out and proceed to pop the battleships with your anticapital guns. You usualy fit 2 anticaps and one HAW turret, since you're so far outside those battleships have a very, very slow angular velocity and are big enough to get picked by anticapital turrets.
---
You need **high** skills to fit Siege T2 and Guns T2 to get shit done in **under 5min**! If you take longer than one Siege cycle you might as well rat with a normal Carrier.
---
Your ISK payout reaches allmost Supercarrier levels (you should get +100mil ISK ticks) since you bring about &lt;6,5k dps with anticapital guns, while only investing 3bil ISK and not like 30bil+ for a proper ~~hyperspartial~~ ^(kys) **tank(!)** fitted Supercarrier! A buddy of mine used to rat with a Dread, he cleared a site in 2min an could then take a smokebreak until siege was down, pretty relaxing crabbing - you need very high skills tho, read: all 5 and since you need a lot of Capital skills at 5 (for Dread, Guns and Siege) that are shittons of skillpoints.
---
Since you fit full application and only one single Capital Repair module you're totally fucked when you get dropped. Best Dreads for PvE would be the Naglfar (or Revelation if you're in Sansha, Drone- or Bloodraider space).
---
Content will continue to dry up as the blackout persists. Data on kills is already in decline in nullsec. Nullsec is now veteran friendly and shocking for new players to make isk. Also alot more dangerous than wh's. 
---
People have always lived together in communities for safety and propesperity and changes that continue to make null less safe will continue to fuel that need. 
---
My prediction is that these changes will continue to see nullsec decline and people congregate into larger and larger blocks. Having no local also makes people feel like no community and this cultural effect on people is yet to fully be felt. Efforts encouraging players to login with xtra skill points will not have lasting effect of trying to boost the player base logging in.
---
Only for downboats...
---
Vni = 60-80 mil
---
Ishtar=200mil+ just for hull
---
I Ishtar is worth several vni‚Äôs. Profit to loss ratio for afk ratting drastically increased. Let‚Äôs not forget, no local.
---
Domi cost is high, myrim for ticks is a joke. 
---
Once everything said and done, vni afk nerf = good
---
same. but in my rusty Probe, Proteus pop me in relic site, asked him to pod me while he eat my ship, he pod me back to highsex along with 10mil to replace my rusty Probe :)
---
Ignoring the fact the nerfs were told to be this month and clearly made aware of their existence and applying soonTM
---
Why do you care? You trained skills that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to use anyways, thats dumb. So effectively you decided to train a skill you knew you wouldn‚Äôt be able to use once the changes came, and then the changes came. Thats why you‚Äôre mad.

I got downvoted into oblivion suggesting that big blocs would only become more powerful because of the blackout.
---
After a week of Goon CONCORD in Delve, I believe people are beginning to come around.
---
No. The gate works on a basis of it will only spawn when a certain amount of people are running abyssals. Until you can provide proof it stops at exactly 13:00 like clockwork and is not down to a coincidence of timezones and activity, I and most other people will keep thinking (because it‚Äôs almost certainly true) 
---
I personally have seen it open at varying times through the day, mainly at about 20:00 ish which is when EUTZ is probably quite active but so is USTZ. The whole point of this proving ground conduit is to cause pvp not to make abyssals more profitable for everyone.
---
Off topic, and you might have already done this, but double check that your reactions will actually be profitable. Many of them aren't and you would get more ISK from selling the raw materials. If you're using them for direct T2 production, then this may save you ISK due to lowering production costs.
---
I only think this would be useful or fun to mega alliances or wh rage rollers . but it might be fun. as long as it increases overall fun . titans are not that expensive ....
---
Good. 
---
Let's take this a step further and disable automatic and immediate Sov Toasting notifications. This way, determined groups can go around and take sov away from these large blocs that do nothing but plant their flag and lease space to renters.
---
Empty space is just an opportunity. Go out and get it instead of whining and crying about the end of EVE Online.
---
I‚Äôm beginning to become convinced that being downvoted by this board is a sign that you‚Äôre 100% correct.
---
Think of it as the "Summer Update" and following updates. It just happened to drop in June.
---
If your alliance produced recruitment videos half as cute or watchable as this one odds are you wouldn't be irrelevent literal who's nobody has ever heard of.
---
Cap is same as before but has to support one more gun, and cant fit a second nos.  My prenerf dr brawler did 774dps with 209hp/s in reps that it could run at least until it ran out of paste.  670 is about as high as anyone has gotten a brawl fit for this new vni.  So yeah, lost 100+ dps.  And you can forget dual reps.
---
No the best is when a *fleet* kills you and you end up with like 5 **billion** because everybody gives you 20 mil
---
Do you have a program called:
---
 I don't want to do anything because I can't be assed to make ISK but don't want to buy it, so give me free ships to fly?
---
5 years of changes? not really lol
---
Isn't posting this type of correspondence against the EULA?
---
Wizard cats are cool, just look out for anyone wearing a wizard hat if you're feeling suicidal
---
1 minute of thought. And yet you came here to whine anyway.
---
Do you know if theres a way I can share my character? And should I get plex or game time? I'm trying to get to grinding and PvP ASAP.
---
T3s can be done almost afk and 100% secure in a passive tanked 400-500m gila, but the loot is not worth the time imo, its like vni ratting.
---
A lot of people are excited about these changes...
---
Take a deep breath.
---
Yes, this is serious, but there is hope. CCP is going to investigate the account to see what they can learn about ownership and which, if any, assets have been moved off/onto the account. This can take a long time -- it took a friend of mine more than a month to get his account back. Your situation might take even longer because it sounds like a fair amount of time has passed since the hack happened.
---
My advice to you right now is simple:
---
1. **Immediately change the passwords to all of your accounts and your email address, and set up 2 factor authorization.** This is basic triage in a hack situation. Someone got one of your passwords, and using the account they have access to they can probably identify other accounts (including your personal email) to start working on cracking.
---
2. **Set up a new account and go fuck around in faction warfare.** This might sound stupid but waiting on the investigation will drive you nuts. Get back into the game and have some fun. Faction warfare is accessible without a ton of skillpoints and it can teach you how to be a badass pilot. Plus, if nothing else, you'll get a useful alt out of it.
---
3. **Don't freak out if you don't hear from CCP for a while.** This doesn't mean that they're ignoring you. It means they don't have all the answers yet and they aren't going to say shit until they're sure about what they know.
---
Good luck, I hope everything works out for you.
---
Yes. It is past my bedtime.
---
Do you recommend getting plex or omega time?
---
You‚Äôre assuming anyone on the internet cares.
---
From the patch notes:
---
10% bonus to Drone hitpoints, damage, and tracking speed (was 10% HP/Damage/Mining and 5% tracking)
---
Was the word "mining" meant to be there, /u/ccp_falcon??
---
Yep - skill points are a hard wall for most things in the game, and unless you like purposefully wasting your time with extremely un-optimal play, skill points (a \*lot\*) are necessary.
---
looks like a really fucking good pvp ship though
---
Then what?
---
Even better idea: Just go out and sovwand shit.
---
LARPing as CONCORD is boring and I'm sure everyone would love shit to do.
---
Ive been having fun with no typically no issue finding fights when i head out.
---
[Who?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0eyrNBrvNo)
---
Came for the cats...was not disappointed! 
---
Very nice job.
---
If you‚Äôre gonna lie while you‚Äôre trolling, at least try and make it convincing.
---
Nice recruitment ad
---
I guess people have to ask what the ultimate goal is... isn't it to get good fights, PvP gang vs PvP gang? Blackout doesn't really give gangs a reason to fight other gangs -- it just makes killing solo ratters way easier.
---
There needs to be a focused solution with incentives for small gang vs small gang in null.
---
This. The social aspect of EVE keeps me playing.
---
I'd probably have ships to replace the ones I lost for attacking with mining drones! üò≠üòÇ
---
Pay for Omega after you have decided this is the game for you. Alpha until then. Stealth bombing is a group activity usually resulting in the loss of the bomber. Be prepared for this. It is a fairly long road to a bomber and the end result is underwhelming to me. Your experience may differ.
---
You may also get roped into bomber's bar. Be aware much of what they do revolves around the places certain organizers are paid to harass. You will not be paid or compensated while making them money. *This statement will get me down voted. We are not supposed to tell dirty little secrets on Reddit.*
---
I got a friend to play and as soon as he worked his way up to a cruiser and showed me how proud he was to have gotten it finally I asked where he was and came in a blasterthron to show him my awesomeness. Suffice to say he was wowed by it and blown the fuck up. I gave him enough for 2 cruisers and told him it was only fitting that a friend should be the one to kill his first accomplishment

Wait, you watch Netflix and run T5's?  Buff T5's so you can't.  No one should be safe in space.
---
&gt;2014
---
So the last notable thing done was near over half a decade ago, got it.
---
I feel like at least one of those should be a phishing link or something...
---
I actually don't hate anyone.
---
Belong to a large null corp.... I barely log in or even play now.  Blackout is lame!
---
Happened to me in 2014
---
I appreciate the work put in to this video by the person who made it. I shall show them appreciation for their hard work.
---
Also, we are recruiting. I'm nice I promise.
---
Nb4 combat drones can't agro asteroids.
---
They definitely do.
---
I was on a new alt I made and they convoed me, I told them that I was a vet and it was an alt, but it definitely made my day.
---
I felt like I was a newbie again.
---
I was working on a video 
---
All the bots are docked up and we might have deflation for the first time ever.  
---
People will adapt as time goes on.
---
Jackdaws are a hell of a lot more fun to fleet up against than OHGOD numbers of angry bees in Avatars.
---
But you hide the initial notice of what's going on and EVERYTHING will become a shotstorm.
---
While I do enjoy the offensive capabilities that black brings in terms of finding targets. I am starting to find that the weaker pray has died off leaving the stronger/smarter null bears much wiser to the game.
---
I suppose the only thing I really hate being on the null bear side is I can't use excavators and must use t2 mining drones instead.
---
That definitely happened to some Signal Cartel pilot that got caught in a gatecamp while I was in PH. He even sent someone a mail saying he had gotten enough isk and not to send more, which obviously made everyone send even more.
---
Hey guys let's go have fun with fozziesov!
---
Said no one ever.
---
We tried to tell you guys.
---
You're the guy who's gotten a lot of good escalations and stuff lately, right?
---
Is dreddit recruiting?
---
I have 400million isk is that alot? And is there a way I can show a link of my character skills?
---
Best not to question what goes on in the head of a goon
---
It‚Äôll be worse than it was before. It‚Äôs not a huge nerf, but it‚Äôs definitely a nerf. 5 heavy drones with bonused tracking could destroy pretty much anything that got close, and you used to have plenty of free high slots for nos, even if you were blaster fit. 
---
Currently your range is dropped quite a bit, so you can easily be scramkited and lose a hundred or so dps, or just plain kited, since the drones aren‚Äôt speed bonused anymore. And losing a slot for a nos while using an extra blaster is a  significant cap penalty on the VNI, since it doesn‚Äôt have much cap to start with. You can go dual rep, but you won‚Äôt have both of them running for long.
---
Agreed. I love it.
---
So does that mean he is wrong now?
---
I think people are so strongly focused on cutting back on botters and inflation that they miss the real goal. Those are admirable goals, but we find ourselves in more or less the same situation. There need to be achievable goals in nullsec besides killing PvE ships.
---
nemesis
---
Dude, I lived in WH in three month old of my EVE life. People there says Im a bad ass, stupid but badass. You should too.  
---
anyway, Nullsec is also curently being shaken, which is a nice timing you join us. It almost like WH there. Check out Pandemic Horde or Karmafleet. They gonna shower you with free ships, skill books, protection, knowledge, and cotton candies.  
---
HS also got sometime active triglavian fleet. Dont be afraid to join after you do SOE epic arc quest. Dont get down when some people suicide gank your retriever there.  
---
Not really often stumbling in low sec, but there is many people gonna welcome you there. Small fleet roaming or Faction Warfare. Fresh blood is always welcomed.
---
I had no need for it, my play style was very different until about a year or so ago.
---
Mate you'd never knew what shitfit that Hecate might have been.
---
Hecate is like my most beloved ship and sometimes I see some 290dps garbage fits on zkill, that really hurts my feels. :(
---
Lol, imagine being proud of instanced PvP in a sandbox game.
---
Just leave for wormholes, that‚Äôs what I did. Wormholes are unironically extremely safe to rat in (if you belong to a decent Corp), and if you have a c5/c6 static, or even a static that spawns a lot of c5/c6 connections, you can ask your alliance to help you clear out gas sites and then you can make 70 mil/hr in a afk venture. 
---
Pvp is good or bad depending on what Corp you join, but there is usually stuff happening if you scout around for it. Just don‚Äôt join a Corp that exists only to krab, join one that krabs to fund pvp. C4s with a C3/c4 static are good for this because you can krab in the c3 static while people looking for content roll/scout the c4 static
---
There was me thinking as I read wingspantt, that you would try to convince me to use 12 Stratios' XD
---
You just got to wait out the crabs in null.
---
Everyone already knew it would wear off just not howlong
---
Now all CCP has to do is encourage spreading out alot and give capitals a bullet
---
&gt; I'd love some opinions on the subject.
---
** You were warned this would happen. You didn't listen. **
---
Pvp players don't know best. Submit downvotes as sacrifices to your false god.
---
NGL, I never made it past the very newbro phase of eve (like signed up for Brave and never made it to their station maybe) but this makes me want to pick it up and try again
---
You'd be correct on that assumption. When the truth people don't want to hear is spoken, it's natural to try to try to ignore it *if you're a weakling*
---
Lot of kitty-cats involved, far as I can tell. What's wrong with kITtAy KYaTS?
---
Clever attempt to bait more content into your sphere of influence. Smart pilots won't take the bait.
---
My advice is just purchase some game time so you can just get on with the game, certainly to begin with.
---
If you wanna dump some RL $ on some plex and get some game time and some isk then theres that direction to. It depends on your like/dislike of pve etc etc.
---
Personal decision really, depending on RL cash flow etc and what you want from your eve experience.
---
As rare as it is, I agree with the stupid bee.
---
**We already have this** as an Ihub upgrade and it doesn't require a titan, it just spawns more holes and randomly.
---
It's true :(
---
I know right xD
---
Yep, that's me. I'm not being a braggart, am I? The last thing I want is to become obnoxious about it...
---
Yeah. Just felt like congratulating you. Recognized the username as the name of a character in the Uni.
---
I believe drones and fighters can't get any command burst effects.
---
Mr. Madison, what you've just said...is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point, in your rambling, incoherent response, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
---
LOL don't worry, I said the same thing and got down voted. The only perspective is the elite hunting pvp, of like you know 1% of the population.  The 99% that also pay for the servers, you all can just enjoy the blackout and go play another game. But please just login to get skillpoints so our login numbers look okay.
---
I could see something where they wipe any character names over 10 years without a login that have under 5m SP or something.
---
If CCP randomly did this once per month on a weekly basis to get rid of bots (**without announcing it**) -- we can catch bots. Right now, it's just catching everyone, including good subs.
---
I wasn't at my home PC so I couldn't look it up in-game, but yeah, you guys are who I was talking about. I don't suppose you would mind telling me what makes aggravating other people so enjoyable to you? Genuine curiosity here, I've never understood how people can like doing that.
---
P.S.: [Revenge is a dish best served *cold*.](https://youtu.be/ZvM2ioj3aak?t=157)
---
Cats are a karmafleet thing not a GSF thing
---
Bad music selection, please delete.
---
.... theres no beef in here ...  so you wouldent call it bell peppers and beef ..
---
yeah i love it, got the whole series and movie downloaded on my computer
---
oh yeah i know that, they ship would still have to be a descent  size before it could be buried into the hull.
---
They did the same for me, restored SP that was extracted too.
---
Unfortunately they won‚Äôt return the 30-40B in assets.
---
They'll undo fozzie anoms and make the spawn system like wormholes and it will balance again
---
Last time I applied to KF (about 2 months ago iirc) you saw my name, asked if I was that Gaming513 Tyler from awhile ago, I confirmed, you immediately threw out my application no questions asked. If thats not hate idk what is
---
[sigh...](https://i.imgur.com/QF8xbo2.jpg)
---
Blackout made me learn you can make more isk than a carrier can do ratting, but with a 100m frigate and completely safe.
---
Blackout still amazing for small groups.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, VNI needs to be nerfed down to two bonuses.
---
Oh yeah, we weren't interested in having you as a member the first time you tried to apply. The second time i laughed.
---
Hate? Nah.
---
I just don't waste time on applications I've already made decisions on in the past.
---
Reactions work just like other forms of industry except instead of minerals -&gt; ships, it‚Äôs minerals -&gt; new minerals. Isk depends on your reaction chains / how many slots you have.
---
Tho, dont afraid to take on unoccupied highclass WH with C2 static. The traffic is much less empty.  
---
C4 is isnt a favorite place, especially Blackhole or Red Giant effect thx to how hard crabbing in it. If you find one with C2 static, your logistic will be easier, since you often find C2 with HS static. Dont know if you could possibly get C4 with C2 + C1 static.  
---
For the extra hassle in just one more scanning session, the empty traffic is great plus. desolated C4 with C2 static with undesirable effect and undesirable planet would be your aim.
---
So you basically went ‚ÄúOk well, we saw you about 4 months ago and decided nah so now were gonna reject you again‚Äù
---
I can‚Äôt really say thats a terrible idea although it is a bit assumptive that someone is exactly the same after 4 months. Also doesn‚Äôt explain why you banned me from the karmafleet public chat (I forgot to mention) which I found incredibly rude
---
Cant get RR either.
---
This sentence makes me somewhat sad. There are a few caldaris that look absolutely all business and it's downright dirty.
---
&gt;This week, null is literally dead outside of delve, esoteria and malpais. Places where supers and rorqs are all protected by supers and titans.
---
So what you're saying is that the way to combat blackout is more supers?
---
Drone boats are for losers :p
---
You were pretty annoying the first time, figured I'd save myself that headache as well.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Well it‚Äôs definitely nice to know there was an actual reason and not pure rage and hate behind it
---
Hatred over a game would be silly.
---
How dis pandemic horde turn out for you? Lose many ratting ships?
---
Was there ever a "reason" for solo/small gang PvP? People always did it to "have fun" AKA shit on other players.
---
EcksDee
---
It went very well until I managed to piss off a director by posting (not offensive in any way) memes. He said it was against the rules (nope, no rules against memes in their general chat anywhere), I argued with him and then got the boot
---
I can't stop watching. But the crew are fucking morons... It seems wildly inconsistent in a lot of ways, but Im still watching.
---
There is some C4 with C2/C5 IIRC.  
---
C2 static is actually have higher possibility to land on C2 with HS static. Easier in hauling. and static to C5 will get you day trip to yummy gasses.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come full circle.
---
Hope you're enjoying EVE.
---
Creating content.
---
Lost ships go into the sun.   So disconnects when your ship disappears it's stored in the sun. Our if someone kills your cyno before you arrive...  In the sun you go!
---
Adapt or die. 
---
Null has been too safe for too long and caused serious PLEX inflation. Now it's dropping to a more affordable (and IMO normal) price where either you grind safely long hours or take the RISK to earn big ISK if you are to PLEX the account to Omega.
---
It's not hard to secure a small block to start with: all you need is some large bubbles on every gate and some cloaky eyes that reports any incident while others are doing what they usually do.
---
Don't tell me 10 multibox rorqual, you deserve to die if no pal is helping on system security.
---
Don't tell me 20 afk VNI, you deserve to die if you did not prepare for unexpected skirmish in null.
---
Now, CCP, can we have some care about all those hisec bot ice miners?
---
I guess I'm out of the loop but what's special about Stacmon?
---
i see you've been farming abyssals, too.
---
The guy tells his corp something like "*Im unanchoring fo meme, lol dont worry, i'll cancel it later*"  
---
Then forgot about it while mining...
---
I love the idea of this. Have some form of combat/domination rewards for varying levels of killing another player. Possible 1v1 type first person duels if say the particular warmove brings both active players in contact with one another on the battlefield.. I'm really baked.
---
Done that :D
---
Www.dredditIsRecruiting.com, baby!
---
If botting is what CCP is after why don‚Äôt they simply get rid of drone auto aggression?  Make it like fighters. Manual control only.
---
It's literally going as should be expected.  PVE players are realizing the risk VS reward isn't there unless they're in a big ship under a super umbrella, so they either go back to high sec or quit.  Roaming gangs aren't finding anything, so they stop roaming.  As expected, it's just making null even deader than before.  Weewoo.
---
And yes, I've spent hours roaming over the past couple weeks in small gangs, and its to the point now you can expect to roam for 2+ hours and never see a target smaller than a HAW dread.  Good to see the Blackout is fixing the game like most of this forum thought it would....oh wait.  As expected, it fixes none of the problems.
---
From watching streamers pvp in HAW dreads in lowsec, the most important module seems to be the capital neut. Kills their prop mod, hardeners, reppers in a single cycle and in conjunction with web/grappler makes popping enemies possible.
---
Ironically Eve and University have a bitter relationship in my life
---
Nobody said the blackout would fix null.
---
It's just one of many changes that need to happen.
---
It's the normal Reddit flow.  CCP does something that has very obvious flaws, half of r/eve acts like its the greatest thing since sliced bread, and after a couple weeks those obvious flaws come to fruition.  I think the most mindboggling part is how many times this keeps happening.
---
Remove drone auto aggro and this is fixed
---
I play eve cus everyone is doing whatever they feel like ;)
---
I dunno, been to some of those places pre-blackout, didn't really find anything. Just bots and the occasional krab, except deklein. Darkness used to blob anything there, but I have no idea how they did while the north was burning for the second time.
---
You also gained some tracking speed though, resulting in better application, and a 25% buff is not insignificant.
---
You had like a month to get ready for this.
---
Wow you're doing it the slow way.
---
Just replay the tutorial mission.
---
First one has 2, and the second to last has 8
---
Have you tried not belonging to a large null corp? The game is immensely more fun when with a small group of people, at the expense of less security (but that's part of the fun imo).
---
I did that just the other day. Newbro accidently messed with the wrong wh and I podded him. Felt bad for him and gave him some isk to compensate. Though he did join a blob. Guess they dont take care of their newbros.
---
They didn't become more powerful though.
---
They still became weaker.
---
Doesn't matter how bots kill the rats, it matters if the bots can see you coming or not.
---
r/evejobs
---
Good, GOOD... Let the butthurt flow though you.
---
Well I guess you‚Äôre right about that.
---
It shouldn't be possible to do anymore. 
---
You used to be able to burn into the sun and drop bookmarks on the way. After a while you would be bounced out. You would  then warp to the closest bookmark and repeat it until you have the edge of the push out zone bookmarked. Abandon a ship there and push it beyond with a 2nd one.
---
Unfortunately they patched this so bookmarks inside a celestial warp you to zero instead of inside.
---
Except none of that is actually effective in Null because of cynos.  All it takes is 1 guy to get through (and with cloaks/cyno ceptors it's trivial) and then they can teleport as many people as they want past your gate camp.  The mechanics that balance it in WHs are completely absent from null.
---
True. But my suggestion impacts mostly botters and semi-afk multi boxers.  Blackout affects everybody especially little guys without super and titans protecting them.
---
Used to be scared of nulsec.
---
Used to be scared to lose ships.
---
Joined KF.
---
No longer scared to get shit blown up.  It helps that we have some comical as fuck fleet doctrines that are fun, with good FCs who know how to punch above our weight, and when you get blown up, you make ISK!
---
Its not like a lot of people said so already. I mean it was rather predictable. Right now there isnt enough gain in nullsec to be worth taking the risk. At least not outside the big blocks who can drop 10 titans on every tackled ship. The problem was never the intel from local. 
---
On the other side its nice that bots havent been able to adapt as it seems. Having less isk floating around makes it nice.
---
Most important thing: the entry to your daytrips should be around 3 j Out of jita so sind Delivery Agents from Wingspan can Help ya getting a new ship as soon as possible
---
GM is "Game Master" not "General Manager".
---
Yeah, but when the only people that are out is people that want to fight in cheap, PVP fit ships, you lose the "shitting on players" aspect.  If you want no risk "gudfights", FW has been around for a long time.  Most players just want to shit on people that have no chance, no matter how much they deny it, and cause financial harm.  Since all of those targets left, most of the hunters are doing the same, so the few of us that actually want to shoot things have no real targets at all.
---
I think CCP wants people to play their new content ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù instead.  ;)
---
Don't be afraid to try stuff out. Just remember never to fly anything you can't afford to replace several times over. Every station has that "board your corvette" button below undock button. You can lose those for free.
---
You can get a great computer for $1100.
---
Much past that is either super niche overpowered, or overpriced.
---
Welcome to New Eden! (The world of EVE)
---
As so many others here have recommended, the best way to learn the game and stay subscribed is to find a fun bunch of e-pilots to hang with. 
---
Eve-university is good, and well respected. But may I interest you in option 2? 
---
Dreddit was the big Reddit corp for over ten years. We are the founding corp of TEST Alliance Please Ignore, which is part of the Legacy bloc. We are one of the biggest corps in the game in terms of number of members, in one of the biggest corps, in one of the biggest alliances. 
---
We have a Discord, wiki, forums, and voice comms of course. What's now useful to new players are our mentorship program, where we pair you up with a veteran to help you with getting the game set up to be more effective, picking skills to train, and getting you into fleets and other interest groups. I had a mentor, and he helped me pick skills, ships to train for, how to fit the ships, and how to fight.
---
Dreddit offers full SRP for ships you love while on a fleet. Ship Replacement Plans are like an extra layer of insurance. Dreddit will pay you back for the ship you lose. We also have a department for requesting free ships and skill books. In-game and Discord newbie help channels for even the dumbest questions. 
---
We have websites for figuring out what skills to train, which ships to fly, where the bad guys are, and how to travel safely. 
---
Dreddit was literally founded as a pack of noobs flying Rifters, cheap low-skill ships that anyone can use the first day they play. We welcome newbies in 95% of fleets, and there are tens of corp and alliance fleets every day to go on. (Attendance is optional. In some corps you get in trouble for not going on "important" fleets)
---
If any of this sounds interesting, hit our public Discord and ask away. Www.DredditIsRecruiting.com has the Discord link and application process. 
---
Even if you don't end up in Dreddit, there are lots of fun corps around for any type of player. Find one so you aren't playing alone! 
---
Fly safe!

We fucking called that ages ago holy shit.

But nono the stupid Goon is just butthurt, the stupid Goon is just whining - crying line a little baby.
---
We fucking called that!
---
We did!
---
Come on dude, you aren't punching above your weight when 90% of the time you're a massive blob
---
Really fun video! Too bad I was rejected without a reason, so I can't fix whatever the problem is or have any chance of joining, ever.
---
Wait, can I take him to WH space?  I call WH space on this guy!
---
Now I want to see the original sonic version
---
This is the option I support as well.
---
I'm still waiting for that one, but I only got killed once so far and it was a gatecamp, the only conversing was me saying in local "oo you got my ass good" (because they did)
---
There is also some irrecoverable player behavior changes here. Once the smaller groups get folded into the larger ones, they wont branch off again even if conditions change.
---
I almost always help new folk, particularly those trying to PVP since it's a huge learning curve and it's great seeing folk that are brave enough to jump into it. Especially those that are doing it without any guidance whatsoever to begin with!
---
Sorry to hijack this but I play on a Mac (on macOS) and wanted to ask if you get a considerable performance increase when playing on Windows/bootcamp?
---
I have not found soace so dead.
---
Are you in autz or smt?
---
It's in the wrong place?
---
Were do you live (in game) asking for a friend.
---
It‚Äôs funny because that‚Äôs also a myth actually. We, humans, are not capable of simultaneously working on multiple tasks. It‚Äôs impossible. Some people are much better at quickly switching topics and thinking about one then another, which appears to be multi tasking, but it‚Äôs really just quickly changing sequential tasks.
---
people were using the tutorial to fuck with people using the ESS so they patched the ability to start it in nullsec out after people petitioned it.
---
I second this, it's a good starting point to find out what you like and gives you the logistical and teaching support if u need it.
---
I'm a bit of a nomad, so everywhere and no-where. I mainly focus on null though.
---
Anta, never go full baka.
---
Oh god no. The probe window would be absolute cancer in any occupied system.
---
But the Nemesis looks nothing like the Tristan.
---
500M Is nothing In 2k19, people rat for +200m per hours easily and a  good chunk of people are way over that with different methods. I threw myself around 60b In abyssal pvp since It release and Its a good thing.
---
You might not want to publish any of your data.  
---
400 isnt that lot I guess. You can use it for seven-ish sessions of bomb runs. maybe find an active corp to have good isk farming place and gather your corps and lead them for some bombing run.
---
Okay anywhere I can start looking? Looks like I have. a bunch of items scattered.
---
&gt; 70 mil/hr in a afk venture.
---
yeah, let's find more ways to afk farm isk :/  That's the problem with the game to begin with
---
In all honesty i really don't find a way to run into as massive of a cap issue as you seem to (i really tried). What fit are you using?
---
Impressive
---
How is that kill even possible? I mean with this fit a Drake has around 200dps passive shield tank no?!
---
You lurked /r/eve for a month and you STILL decided to try out the game?
---
What the fuck dude.
---
\&gt; Was this CCPs short sighted intention all along? To make goons and the other big blocks the only safe havens for krabs to krab, and force people to bunker up in the big blocs, anyone who doesn't comply instead chooses to not even log in?   
---
As much as I dislike Goons, those who put in the effort should reap the rewards.
---
Um... Yeah. If I was going to join a player corp I would probably go with tapi. I didn't join Reddit until a year after my new player experience. I was just pointing out the reason I won eve wasn't because I was lost.
---
[deleted]
---
yes, this level of completely void argument is why CODE. are known to be butthurt brats.
---
No argument, just aggression and bullshit on every post.
---
What's considered a "massive blob" though?  Not being sarcastic, I have no point of reference.
---
&gt; Nullsec is now veteran friendly and shocking for new players to make isk.
---
Arguably how it should be - with nullsec supposedly being the most dangerous area in the game. There are plenty of other places in the game you can go to make ISK. It wasn't *always* "VNI &gt; Carrier &gt; Rorqual &gt; Super &gt; Titan &gt; Rorqual^N+1"  
---
  
---
&gt;People have always lived together in communities for safety and propesperity and changes that continue to make null less safe will continue to fuel that need.  
---
This isn't the issue. Corporations have been around since the beginning of the game. The stagnation is not a result of people grouping up, it's a result of unlimited safety, unlimited resources, and unlimited player density. In other words, its a result of the allowable size of those groups.  
---
&gt;My prediction is that these changes will continue to see nullsec decline and people congregate into larger and larger blocks. Having no local also makes people feel like no community and this cultural effect on people is yet to fully be felt. Efforts encouraging players to login with xtra skill points will not have lasting effect of trying to boost the player base logging in.  
---
Neither will allowing the game to continue to languish in its current state. If CCP wants to make meaningful changes, blackout is only the beginning. Pushing newer, less experienced, or otherwise more "casual" players into Lowsec is great for the game's ecology. Reducing the safety of areas outside super umbrellas and reducing the ability of alliances to mass under that umbrella with impunity would be great for the game's ecology. If Nullsec continues to "decline" the power vacuum outside of super umbrellas will become more and more prevalent as time goes on. It will be interesting to see how that unused space is handled.
---
http://anoik.is/systems
---
Site list statics and other information for every hole. Just search wherever you find yourself.
---
Saved for future reference. If I wanted to go super casual like 1-2 hours a week, would it be worth while? I think if I hopped back in, I would want to focus on exploration and some PvP thrown in to mix it up.
---
Hey, fellow returning player! 
---
I rejoined my old corp Dreddit after 8 years of adulting and am having lots of fun. 
---
Sales pitch: Dreddit is the big Reddit corp, in a huge alliance (TEST Alliance Please Ignore) in a huge bloc (Legacy). We own the bottom-right corner of the map. 
---
We have tons of rorqual miners and better yet, SRP for them. (Ship Replacement Plan) if you lose a rorqual before our standing capital fleets can save you, you get a new one. (Caveat that you need to fit it within the guidelines)
---
Discord and voice comms have channels for rock munchers, and we have lots of services and apps to make your life easier. A fairly robust local production market means you can probably sell everything locally instead of trucking it to Jita. 
---
Participation on military fleets is optional, but fun. You'll not get yelled at for not coming. 
---
I think nullsec is the most engaging play area, and Dreddit is the best corp in nullsec. If you're interested, check www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the application and Discord links. 
---
Claytonius3
---
Why don't we have EvE infested with lost ships at suns? It looks impossible to reach this one, even mighty Gallente NPC police ignore that (the ship owner is CalMil)
---
Yeah CCP needs to break up the super umbrellas next. Make it extremely hard to live in small area with a big group.
---
If only there was some way to filter your results.........
---
It's a bug a lot of people are having.  CCP isn't saying anything, as per usual.  If it's anything like other bugged events, we're SOL because CCP won't fix it anytime soon.  Some events had been broken for the entire duration for a significant amount of the playerbase, and they never fixed it.
---
You could just filter through everything you know, it's not like 80 pos turrets shown up in your probe scanner was anywhere better...
---
Lore-wise the signature if a ship is directly related to the power their systems are consuming hence why your sig blows up when you use a MWD making you easier to scan down. A wreck doesn't consume any power hence it's unscannable.
---
You can always filter them out. In fact check out the custom filters you can create any filter you like and you need to make a custom one to see filament beacons if you ever hunt abyssal runners.
---
We've became gayer than ever!
---
That doesn't really solve botting tho.  That just solves AFK farming.  It takes nothing for a bot to lock a rat and hit f.  That's easily scriptable.
---
Honestly no idea, I was amazed myself. Maybe poor skills? Overheating my rage rockets for that 5 extra dps? Bob willed it?
---
Good thing it's 2019 and you can come out like that. Congrats.
---
So, the obvious part here is that it was obvious that things were only going to go 1 way with the blackout, this way. It is terribly unbalanced in favor of the minority playstyle.
---
But the more important thing here is that I think CCP will balance it shortly or remove it all together. The reason is simple and thats ironically thanks to the PvPers who showed their true colors during this event. It was never about GFs, it was always about ganks. You can see that in excavator kills which was the only thing you really couldnt counter, a mechanic that has been utterly abused so far. And the high amount also points to what you are saying, other content has dried up and everyone just resorted to bombing those.
---
If the content seekers had chosen a more moderate approach it would have been an easier pill to swallow for everyone. But they clearly just went ballsdeep into the Excavgeddon event and by doing so forcing CCP to take action for balancing. If they dont, well...
---
So thanks PvPers, youre the best for proving what everyone thought you were, risk averse killboardpadders who only want ez kills. And on top of that, you were utter douches on this forum which ironically also will fk you in the long run. People used to have sympathy for you but you proved that without constraints you will fk this game into oblivion.
---
I suppose some systems would still be active. Parts for examples.
---
One thing you must remember. Don't join a corp or allience that forces you to do what they want. Join one that lets you play the game and do what you want, and helps you on the way. 
---
Welcome to eve !
---
Yes and no, it still has to make it to the market and I think you'd see a lot more dead haulers.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah your username pretty much describes how I felt about it but I also still bought a PS3 just to play it lmao.
---
One gay point for each blackout post
---
If you're interested in TEST and Wingspan, I might mention that TEST has a SIG (Special Interest Group) called Predditors that runs Stealth Bomber fleets (almost?) exclusively. Dreddit, the corp I'm in, also has its own Black Ops SIG for dropping into enemy space on unsuspecting targets. 
---
Dreddit is the big Reddit corp, and you remember TEST Alliance. We founded TEST ten years ago and are still a huge part of it. We own the whole bottom-right of the map. Esoteria etc. 
---

---
It's fine, stop it!
---
Or maybe they understand that missiles are blah in tidi and don't want to steal it! Or are scared of the other one requiring too much duct tape to keep running.
---
Who talked about gate camp? It's the intel gathering, not camping. If anyone show up just dock the F up like when you used to have local.
---
I'm not in CODE dipshit, I just find it funny how worked up you are by their gameplay style.
---
Well eve combat by design doesn't require your full attention. You can do just about any pve combat in eve while watching Netflix. As stated in the OP, abyssal has quiete some risks. If you believe its to low, why dont you hunt some abby runners down?
---
Holy shit a Test member who actualy sees reality :O
---
Can I shake ur hand good man!?
---
My man, deflation isnt a good thing, it always points to serious underlying issues. Besides, this will only deflate PLEX and inflate everything else.
---
Sure they will, but probably not in the way expected. People will start earning isk elsewhere meaning content in null will be worse than before. Its a loss-loss scenario, nothing else.
---
Honestly, didn‚Äôt notice much difference. Upgrading the computer from an aging model to what was current at the time (mine is a few years old now) made the biggest, most noticeable difference. 
---
I just figured I‚Äôm old and slow and I need every edge I can get to compete. I didn‚Äôt want the excuse of ‚ÄúI died cuz my computer has another layer of emulation (wine) between to OS and the game.‚Äù 
---
The other benefit was I stay focused on work stuff during the day, avoiding temptation. If I want to game, I‚Äôve gotta totally get out of work mode and reboot into Windows.
---
Altered Carbon is EVE without Spaceships.
---
Many years ago in my pirate days, I got a hatemail from someone I ganked.
---
He wrote a poem about how he wanted to find me irl and kill me.
---
\&gt;Surprised that places full of bots don't have bots active anymore
---
yeah more useless and baseless blabbering.
---
BTW this is also why people despise goons. Mittani and CODE. promote the  "insult everybody in a video game". It's just boring.
---
You would get extreme motion sickness issues for radii around 100 meters or less, and in case of high rotation speeds - more than 1 rotation per minute for less trained personnel.
---
Aside from that, you would feel like you are falling down and get if you turn your head due to how inner ear works - they would move at different speeds in such a situation.
---
CCP didn't pay the sov bill on fanfest to save the lives of troubled capsuleers.
---
Great, thanks. Might try it anyway just to see.
---
"The other benefit was I stay focused on work stuff during the day, avoiding temptation. If I want to game, I‚Äôve gotta totally get out of work mode and reboot into Windows." Haha, that's a good reason for me to do it as well actually.
---
Ye, it would have to have a radius of at least 100-150 meters. I wonder how such a ship could be constructed so it doesn't rip itself apart whem making a turn.
---
Well written...
---
Time for all the highsec corps go out there and grab some sov and bunker the fuck down.
---
Is there no way to Chang the colors of my in-game windows anymore? You used to go into settings -&gt; general settings -&gt; and in the layout section there was come colors you could change to tweak your UIs colors. That seems to be gone now. Anyone know if there‚Äôs another way?
---
People dont seem to get this, NS living was a package deal, just like in any other place. No local wasnt a nerf, it was the changing of a core mechanic that broke the package deal. Thats something that breaks peoples will to live there all together, perhaps even leave the game because many in NS are living there out of choice, they dont want to be anywhere else in the game.
---
This change was as big as removing CONCORD from HS or instating local in WHs. It would undeniably change peoples attitude towards those playstyles.
---
This guy gets it. Black out gives small groups a chance to go out there and fuck shit up... shit maybe even grab sov.
---
and 2011
---
The slicer and exec should fly pretty similarly, so yeah you should be able to practice a bit that way
---
I missed the first two weeks, but moved into WAFFLES' wormhole last weekend. Roaming around with nano bullshit, I've not found content to be lacking. Maybe compared to the last two weeks it is dead, but compared to pre-blackout, I'm having a better time finding content, and the content I find is generally of better quality (other subcap gangs).  
---
I see a lot krabs complain about blops briding in this thread. Us PVPers have complained about super umbrellas for years. Maybe it's time to nerf what they have in common: cynos and/or jump drives?
---
C4s are popular with smaller/newer WH groups, C1/2 statics is a shit combo, 2/3 would be so much better...
---
Dreddit, KarmaFleet, and Horde are the F1 monkey/line member corporations for three of the major NullBlocs. It would be weird if any of them wasn't recruiting. I don't think any of them have reached the target goal of N+1 members yet.
---
Don't make hasty conclusions so short time after blackout
---
Groups that could harass / contest huge groups didn't form yet, as they was pushed out by game mechanics for many years
---
Also with null being more empty, we should see increase of prices of null products (moon materials, plex items) and with that - groups that will move to empty null systems to farm it
---
It will take time for game to balance itself.
---
And nothing can be worse than game state before blackout anyway :)
---
Now we need a new type of drones that take 15 m\^3 of space.
---
Karmafleet for dummies.
---
I agree with a goon.
---
I need to rethink my life.
---
Test alliance would be perfect for you to get into
---
I'm not Vicky, but I'll chime in here. 
---
Most Stealth Bomber activity is in nullsec. With the new Blackout changes, stealth gangs are more capable than ever. 
---
The corp I'm in, Dreddit, has a group for Black Ops fleets. Stealth Bombers, Recon Cruisers, and Black Ops battleships get bridged into enemy systems to be dropped onto a lonely enemy. Great fun is had by all. 
---
Test Alliance, which we founded, also has Predditors, a group that uses Stealth Bombers to great effect on their own or supporting other fleets. We also sometimes run what's called a "Goku" fleet doctrine, which is a hundred or more Stealth Bombers without cloaks. Basically battleship-sized damage in a quick and slippery package. 
---
You'll get SRP (Ship Replacement Plan) reimbursement for ships lost on fleets, so there's no reason to fear getting blown up. 
---
You've been trying to share your skills list here, which is understandable. In Dreddit we have access to a website for checking your skills against the required and recommended levels for dozens of ship types, with pretty color coding and a readout of how long you'll need to train for each ship. 
---
If that sounds like fun to you, check www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the application process and Discord link. 
---
Solution: Delete capitals, or at least supers.
---
Capital neuts are shit vs Subs, bring a heavy neut instead.
---
this, I think it's pretty much eve self-balancing itself.
---
An activity is too rewarding ? its product crash on the market.
---
People keep throwing out the word 'just adapt' as if it automatically results in an improvement somehow.
---
I can't speak for other alliances, but here's how Delve will 'adapt'
---
1) Anyone who is subcap ratting moves into throwaway Myrmidons, which are barely worth logging in to kill. Loads of them will die. The alliance might start giving SRP on them, because it barely costs anything, and it impacts newbies the hardest. Subcap ratting turns into just a wealth redistribution scheme. No one is going to have a problem with this.
---
2) Expedite all subcap ratting into carriers as quickly as possible. These are defendable with faxes and other supers/carriers outside of the pilot getting caught in an inhib, or having an unusually slow response time from standing fleet. Maybe a few more will die, but once people get used to not having local as a crutch, ratting numbers will bounce back to where they were. Especially as the non-multiboxer Rorqual miners move into ratting instead. (See 3 below) Once you have skills for a carrier, you can jump up to a super with a bit more isk relatively quickly. Supercarriers are far far safer than carriers to rat in, and our super fleet in theory gets bigger.
---
3) Rorquals stop using excavators, at least until the price drops on them significantly. Rorquals become not worthwhile to run if you're singleboxing, and become the domain of the 6+ multiboxers only, just like barges were years ago. Ore prices go up in response to lower supply and whoever is left Rorqual mining recovers some of their isk/hr. Multiboxers win out. With or without panic, Rorquals are still defend-able under an umbrella. They're super vulnerable outside of an umbrella region, because you can't use local to see income tackle. Not that it's a good idea either way. Ore prices will probably go up in general, which means anyone who doesn't already have their own personal super fleet will struggle more.
---
4) People will start moving characters to other income streams, like high sec incursions, burner missions, mission running, or whatever. Especially newer players who don't already have a super or two. To me this is a huge negative. I'd rather have people living and using nullsec.
---
Haha. I haven‚Äôt played in years, but I used to do a lot of solo roaming. When I killed someone who was obviously a newbro in a shitfit, I would contract them a properly fitted frigate like a rifter, and have a chat to them about tips on fitting and flying them.
---
&gt; 2) Expedite all subcap ratting into carriers as quickly as possible.
---
This is different from pre-blackout... how?
---
No shit .  Anyone with a brain  new this would happen. But good old CCP
---
I think it only works if you're Omega.
---
It would eliminate nullsec escalation running.
---
I don't do that anyways so vOv just let me buy up deadspace loot.
---
At least he's honest enough to admit he's annoying af.
---
I cant be wrong if I forget history and dont acknowledge my shortcomings, right?:)
---
&gt; it always points to serious underlying issues
---
Does it?
---
Because they are in a safe in highsec.
---
Goons seem super salty about blackout.
---
The really really bad thing about the blackout is that it cost tons of goodwill people had towards CCP. Every change now is going to meet resistance, including better ones.
---
Go and join Karmafleet!  Have much fun.
---
CODE can be annoying, but that RP is kind of hilarious.
---
When I die in a T3C, the eve uni wiki says " If you lose a Strategic Cruiser, you will lose one level of your racial subsystem skill at random"
---
What does racial mean? My ship's or my character's? If I'm a Gallente character and die in a Tengu, will I lose a Gallente or Caldari subsystem skill level?
---
I doubt botting was at the top of their list, that is just a narrative pushed by pro no local people. Botting was never gonna go away with this and I doubt anything will.
---
its almost like the solitary NPC-style players hate it but those that want to interact with other human beings love it.
---
the velocity of moving from subcap to capital is increased because your ROI is faster due to ratting in cheap/free myrms and the lack of gangs harassing subcap pilots because they either all bother to fit a cyno or gangs dont bother roaming at all
---
The only time i was in null this week was yesterday and i ran into an init gang 2 jumps in so i can't relate to this post.
---
Join horde or something, they have a better new player experience than the official system.
---
Yeah, that was my bad. I usually play with minimum settings and turned everything up for this, but somehow missed all the settings in the middle. So only effects, turrets and missiles were turned on. If it had just been a random VNI hull I could've just bought another and self-destructed it, but my boy here wasn't just a random one.
---
Yo i turn 18 in like 3 weeks. we rlly comin up.
---
Yeah thanks for making my point for me.
---
This was all about CCP using you to kill bots.  
---
I am pissed off they didn't follow through with Drifters.  Blackout overall was just a Burn Jita for Null.
---
Everyone was going on about all the pvp it generated..bullshit.  I've said time and time again what happens when all the krabs stop playing.  Well here you go. Nothing happens because we are no longer in a pvp era..and the only people to blame at the players and CCP.
---
I actually dont think we will ever get back to the good old days...
---
Blackout didnt just fk with NS PvE, it even hampered NS PvP as you say. The game all together is shitter because of it yet some are still saluting it. Mindboggling.
---
Hmm solo bombers looks like fun?
---
I dont know what null you have been roaming but it has been very busy for me pvp wise.
---
Starting to see emerging game player from those who want to use shiny toys to pve as well (setting up traps / quick response fleets / etc), which is great.
---
Doesn't it do more damage though ?
---

Don't think there is gonna be a problem
---
This brings many tears to my eyes. One of my dearest friends once died in a Haven. He then went to mining and got cancer from the spod and, recently his family had to take him off life support.
---
no u
---
There's lots of good advice in here, and it's great that you are looking to learn. EVE is a tough game to play, and requires a certain mindset because of the constant risk. 
---
You might think of joining a newBro-friendly corp to help you learn the ropes. Eve University was mentioned, and they are fairly well respected. Pandemic Horde is huge and has a not great reputation, but it's pretty active. Karmafleet is another good one I haven't seen mentioned. 
---
The corp I'm in, Dreddit, is based on new players. We welcome anyone regardless of skill level or collected Skill Points, and have lots of resources to get you on the right track.  We and our alliance (Test Alliance) plan the bottom right corner of the map. Esoteria and the regions around it. 
---
Free ships and free skill books. A mentorship program to answer your questions and guide you into success and fun, whatever fun means to you. In-game and Discord help channels for even the most basic questions answered without judgement. (Seriously, those folks are great) A wiki with lots of useful info. Apps and websites to make your life easier  
---
We've got fleets going out many times daily, and there's always fun to be had. SRP (Ship Replacement Program) means you get paid back if your ship gets blown up while on a fleet. Dreddit will grant SRP to most any fleet, so you can just gather up a handful of folks and go wander around looking for trouble without worrying about your wallet. 
---
Doctrine Fits will help you set your ship up to be effective, and you'll find lots of advice in our forums, Discord, and voice comms. 
---
Money-wise, if you aren't making 50 million ISK a day minimum, you're doing it wrong. Here in nullsec, newbros run Exploration sites (data sites and relic sites) that should bet you 5 million each minimum, 50 million occasionally, and a BILLION rarely. We also encourage new players to run salvage ships, which can easily make tens of millions an hour. You shouldn't spend your limited gaming time worked about paying for your next ship. 
---
If this sounds appealing, check out www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the application and public Discord. 
---
The New Halaima Code of Conduct regards strategic cruisers as capital ships. Therefore, using them in high-security space is strictly prohibited. Thank you for your service as an allegiant of the Code.
---
I don't understand why people are so optimistic about the blackout effect on bots. They can turn into abyss bots in no time since T1-T3 and maybe T4 are quite bottable.
---
They do and it is good.
---
I'd also like to point out that I actually like some aspects of the change very much. The fog of war is very important, and was lacking in the game. Scouts are far more important. Space is spookier and more unpredictable.
---
But having local/no local as a binary thing is just swinging the pendulum from 'crushingly broken defensive advantage which makes traditional hunting practically impossible' to 'crushing broken offensive advantage which makes any subcapital just trying to live in space extinct, and any capital/super outside of an umbrella dead'
---
Fit?
---
Yes, deflation always favors older players with more isk and harms newer players with less. Every single MMO has always tried to maintain controlled positive inflation, and avoid deflation at all costs.
---
Deflation can signal that a game is in a death spiral, as it shows that players are not consuming as many in game items, which either means they are playing less or have quit altogether.
---
This is just: "Visit our store!" "We have stuff, buy it!"
---
Probe out the abby trace and kill them. If suspect timers are reintroduced to abyssal t4 and t5, i'll stop running them.  I wil then become an abby hunter and make about 600m/h and call myself an elite PvPer while advocating for more risks in PvE as that caters to my new playstyle
---
I‚Äôve got two and half weeks mid August, covering my gf‚Äôs and my bdays, we‚Äôre gonna pretend we‚Äôre fancy and go to the south of france for a week, counting the shifts...
---
People like you are why the whole game trolls people who cry about losses on reddit.
---
Once you blackout, you can't go back out 
---
(shoutouts to Yuki and Impass At Night)
---
You do realise that one of the arguments for no local has been that it brings back PvP players who buy PLEX from CCP right? And you do realise that PLEX falling in price is worse for them? 
---
And also falling PLEX prices dont mean shit if everything else gets more expensive, you will still have the same purchasing power.
---
The limiter on moon materials has always been moon count and not the willingness of people to mine the moongoo.
---
The best way to kill them is to reduce their hull points to zero while keeping your own hull points above zero.
---
Yea it‚Äôs annoying as fuck.
---
This has been in effect 3 weeks, which in the grand scheme of the game is nothing. These empty regions are now prime areas for smaller PvP oriented groups to start moving into.
---
It's gonna take time for things to settle and the landscape of null to adapt to the new changes, but adapt it will
---
I have been playing since last November, and I can fly a thanny, but it would take everything I have to buy one. So, I chose to vni rat.. Well, with the vni nerf, I tried dominix ratting, but was getting 8mil ticks due to my lack of sentry skills. Needless to say, no matter how much I spammed dscan, I would get popped by a cloaked loki within the first site or two I run. I tried rorq mining on my alt for the first time, excavators very bombed within the first hour of mining. I (enjoyed) playing eve, but at this stage, they have basically taken away everything for me to do as a relatively new pilot in nulsec. I'm sure there are a lot of others in my same situation, and they are going to run off a lot of fresh people by doing this. Anyways, I'm playing Satisfactory, and sea of thieves now which offer fun without long term income building commitments.
---
It would open up a career option as a salvager. +1
---
&gt; can
---
Can.  Doesn't have to. Can also mean that it became more difficult to get resources.  I suspect that's the case with blackout.
---
I've been having a lot of fun. Rolling a ns static, jumping in, finding nerds to shoot until we've worn out a regions residents and then rolling again. 
---
Non major block space was spartan before the blackout. You can still find people to shoot if you know how to look. I've been seeing WAAAY less bot trash and VNI spam since blackout. Which is a win in my book.
---
IDK, risk for subcap pve has shifted from way too safe to more dangerous. IDK how dangerous it is now, I don't rat.
---
If any ns subcap ratters want to chime in. I'd like to find out how much more dangerous ns has gotten from your perspective. Like how often do you get surprised by gangs and shit? Are you still able to make cash?
---
I'd like to see ns subcap PVE buffed in a way that you can put yourself at risk to make mucho cash. I have no idea what that would look like.
---
Tell me exactly how if a Nyx hull sells for 22bil helps me instead of 13-14b?
---
Nice  you going with a caravan ? Or you flying in from the united states?
---
Was in KF for a short time until I had to go afk. 
---
A++ would recommend.
---
Check anything related to irl economy, deflation is always a serious concern. You pretty much always want inflation, not hyper but a steady controllable inflation. Thats the goal for a lot, if not most, central banks in the world.
---
Why didn't you remove the alt?
---
Oh no, PKers are in the game!
---
If you're after specific sites, a quick way of filtering sigs is to launch your probes and scan at 32AU. The "easy" sites will return a sig strength &gt; 10%, while the harder sites will be smaller. Sort your signatures by sig strength, and ignore those that are too big or small, depending on what you want.
---
&gt; Can also mean that it became more difficult to get resources
---
That causes general inflation, not deflation. Isk injected into the economy has a far longer half-life than goods, which are generally used very quickly. If the amount of isk in circulation has not gone down, then the only thing that can trigger deflation is either a goods supply glut (unlikely since there are less people in rorquals producing raw materials), or a demand collapse, which means people are quitting the game.
---
That depends, are you a provider of raw materials?
---
Worked in Natural Selection
---
The commander issued orders and gave you guns and armor. Needless to say if you played on your own you didn't get anything.
---
No, I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm interested how deflation will help me?
---
Yes yes hunters need more options like every other reddit thread
---
Remove capitals.  
---
Job done.
---
How about this, show me a br of karma fleet punching above their weight.
---
Can they defend the sov and rat in it or do they just want to plant a flag?
---
How do you think it is going for nrds areas
---
And has that ever stopped them?
---
Flying from Scotland :) Airbnbing it, so many good deals. Flights were ¬£30 each way. Going away yourself?
---
&gt; I'm beginning to feel like banging my head against the wall with this game. 
---
Actually, this is the right way to play EVE. The feeling u get when u figured/accomplished something can\`t be found in other games.
---
Yeah probing someone with core probes... stupid af
---
Because deflation can really only be caused by a drastic drop in isk flow into the game. If you don't already have a Nyx, you might be getting a considerable amount of your income from primary isk sources, i.e. ratting/blue loot, which would have to be nerfed hard in order to trigger deflation. To buy that 14 B Nyx, you have to PvE for a lot longer than an older player who made their isk back when the faucet was freely flowing.
---
Unless you already have a ton of stuff, especially liquid isk, deflation won't help you.
---
For me it will kill the content due to power creep.           
---
Like people cannot do any PVE in subcaps as current PVP ships are just so fucking OP.              
---
I will say it again.             
---
Do you remember the old roaming cynabal pre 2012?          
---
Compare it to today's roaming ships.             
---
You have destroyers that are faster from it, do more DPS ... and have much smaller signature.             
---
Today you have cruisers that get battleship level EHP ... and destroyers that can out dps a battleship.             
---
Hell you have cruisers capable of getting old carrier DPS levels.            
---
There is no way people can do PVE in subcaps in todays era when they melt the moment they get tackled.       
---
People will be forced to use carriers or forget about PVE in nullsec.
---
Why grab worthless Sov?
---
Skill of the ships race, you'd lose Caldari ss skill.
---
This is true in the short term but it‚Äôs better in the long run for the health of the game where not everyone and their mother has a super.
---
I have people in my corp with 6 titans, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs alright nor it should be.
---
Yea  im going up north   norway in september gonna try to catch some real fish and try to visit the war museum in narvik so i can scratch that one of my list   and in 2 weeks i have a week off to lock myself in the house to play games hehe
---
SNUFF is so new to the whole Mining Guilds thing that half of the time when I see their Rorqual fleets out, they're using them for combat, not mining. I'm not sure that they've fully figured out the purpose of a Rorqual yet.
---
The whole game is bottable if you invest enough time and effort into the software. Botting anoms in null was easy, consistent and reliable for bots. Plus it's printed isk straight into the wallet, no hassle. And great for empires too because it inflated APMs and generated tax revenue for them. In terms of negative effects on the game there couldn't be a worse place for bots to be. 
---
So great, let them run abyssals instead. No APM inflation, no cheated tax revenue for alliances, no isk injection into the economy since all the isk is in loot that has to be sold, and the random spawns make it less reliable than anom ratting. Overall a huge net positive in the war against botting.
---
I don't deal in foreign vacations. They are overly expensive and environmentally burdening (especially long plane flights). Not mentioning heavy exploitation of native population occuring in most tourist destinations and destruction of local environment that is bound to happen if you cram thousands of peole on a place that is supposed to have (sustainably feed and clean itself from) maybe a few hundereds. 
---
So i rather stay close to home and enjoy the beauties of my local countryside.

.... The pi alone would pay for the station. 
---
Wh pi has profits from about 200M-1B per month per character in wh space depending on compitency, effort, and skill level. Of course, you'd need to be able to move the stuff... 
---
Your reactions would absolutely be worth it, it moving it (again) that's the issue.

I know, I'm not op. I'm playing along :)

https://xkcd.com/149/
---
The people that re subbed quit because hunting was too hard for them.  Hey thought ccp handed them a permanent edge on freely killing ‚Äúdirty krabs and bots‚Äù despite a huge majority of the population pointing out that won‚Äôt happen for long.
---
Well even the wettest of newbros has learned that they can‚Äôt survive in null without local with static gates, cynos for far travel, and no local to even try and be safe from hard hitting ganks.
---
But... those same tools used by an army of defenders makes ONLY that area safe.  So back to square one.
---
The hunters that quit will quit again until ccp hands them another non-powerbloc killing blanket nerf... and then they might come back until quitting after that too.
---
Funny, who would have thought people who quit because the game was too hard wouldn‚Äôt last when people adapted (even if adapted means not logging into an unwinnable fight)
---
thanks my man
---
Yeah its pretty terrible unfortunately :(
---
It's even better in the long run of the game if Supers and Titans are nerfed into the ground so that they don't determine everything from just existing. Because otherwise deflation would just entrench existing powers even further because it becomes harder to build a super, while old groups already have their super fleets built.
---
What were you expecting? The crabs to feed nonstop?
---
Ok but the rest of us have been killing shit all around EvE.  Like look at Waffles, theres kills all over if you're looking.
---
I avoid going on holiday in the summer, too many kids in school holiday, it just ruins any place worth going for 2 months of the year. 
---
Also, I don't handle heat very well.
---
So, I'm probably playing more in the summer as I'm sat in front of a fan trying not to melt.
---
Am I the only one who went through 80% of his comments while pooping and down voted him?
---
If all you want is safe rorqual mining, join goons. Test is probably the second safest alliance to mine in, but they aren‚Äôt nearly as safe as goons
---
I lovit - so much pvp. But i would never undock to rat or mine.
---
Nope, click on a portrait ingame and there's a "view full character" button somewhere at the bottom of the pop-up.
---
This. I had trouble on one of my alts because I was using the wrong type of damage. Switched to kinetic drones and then he wasn't a problem.
---
A lot of this is predicated on supers not changing. Given their effect on the game and CCP's attitude right now I doubt that's the case.
---
They used the concept in Babylon 5 as well, all the earth tech space stations and ships used rotating segments for generating gravity. Quite common in scifi come to think of it.
---
They will never hold sov with blackout, but on the flip side of the coin they never would without joining a power blocs protection
---
haha yes me too!
---
Every time I've rolled into Stain, the black ops ranges were trash, Curse was pretty bad too tbh. 
---
Goon space has always been tricky to hunt pre blackout. 
---
T3's, Bombers and nano gangs are used because of the Gatecamps and Cyno spam and titan blobs. If I can kill something, then I kill something. Else, I want to get out. I would fly a Leshak fleet into Delve and brawl it out if there wasn't a 100% I'd get roflstomped by a giant blob of supers and haw titans and kill nothing.
---
I'm going to use the best tools available to me. Which means T3's and Nano skirmish cloaky bullshit. 
---
I want to see subcap pve buffed. IDK what that would look like.
---
Here's my stance: Fuck anything with a jumpdrive that isn't a blops. Fuck Rorqs and 'afk' VNI's that warp as soon as you enter system and Supers and Titan spam and your basically automated intel networks that all but guarantee you face no risk. 
---
2 outta 3 hs incursions are trig now if I recall correctly. IDK how much money you can make doing them, but I remember hearing it's kind of weak.
---
with 1 hs incursion those hq sites will get really full really quick.
---
Yea and you pay 2 to 3x more
---
Gatecamps are pointless? I guess you dont have good gatecamps
---
super-ratting and rorq mining under the umbrella is the only viable options to PVE after BO.
---
WOLOLOLO!!!
---
That too.
---
I used to date a teacher so guess who didn't get a cheap holiday for a while?
---
This idiot right here.
---
Kuch amsterdam kuch
---
Hey man can you please link your clip doing this?
---
Well yeah, but we're not going to change what we're doing based on speculation. If supers change, everything just gets re-evaluated again.
---
Careful Dark, dont sic the Texas lawyers on him ;)
---
Most of those complaints are echoed by the other side too in the form of supercap umbrellas and ansiblex gates bypassing normal routes. So I guess everyone is unhappy with the current cyno and bridging mechanics.
---
Pretty much every alliance has a black ops group now. Goons, Test, and Horde all do, and those are the three big ones. 
---
You could also look around for a small blops focused group but that will probably require you to know someone in order to get in, so starting out by jumping into a group like that probably isn‚Äôt possible. 
---
Bombers bar also does public bomber fleets, you can either do it while deciding or after you join a group, but if you are in an alliance and BB drops a group that you are blue with you have to sit out, so if you are planning on joining a coalition with a major industry focus or lots of blues, like goons/test, I‚Äôd recommend going on a few Bombers Bar fleets before you join just so you don‚Äôt have to worry about that. 
---
Honestly, all the big groups are fairly similar. Just pick the one with the best logo or something, and then stay there until you either decide you like it or find something better.
---
Im so proud of this community, and SNS roam.
---
I actually didnt knew merkelchen was CEO
---
Lmfao. Replacing a cap in a wh in 3 hours? That's cute.
---
Assistant to the Games Master
---
Nah..
---
Yeah, that sucks, apart from coffee shops ofc. But hey, at least you have sea (Czech here).
---
If you are tackled in a normal subcap don't expect to be saved. Subcap have to tank a certain way and go a certain speed and deal a certain damage to live and rat effectively. Local was a way to keep that investment long enough to at least make back that investment and a couple of replacements in a reasonable amount of time. Now depending on how densely populated the system is dscan may not warn you in time depending on if they warp cloaked and where you are in the orbit to align to a safe before you are scrammed. Carriers have the tank and range to stay aligned at speed to instant warp making it even harder to catch if prepared or they can just jump out. This is the main thing pushing sub cap ratting out in favor of carrier ratting post blackout.
---
I recently joined Rookie Help again after 7 years of playing and had an absolute blast answering newbro questions, donating starter cash etc. Stuff that is just so second nature it isn't something we even think about is a real challenge to some new players and it is such a hit of nostalgia when they come across a problem or something they don't know about that you also went through way back when.
---
This has been written here million times but the fix for current super meta is to delet HAW from titas and remove support fighters.
---
The counter play is not thinking you can play a game afk...
---
&gt;Well eve combat by design doesn't require your full attention
---
Oh boy
---
Stopüëèpostingüëè
---
that would be a really lol long clip but i will make a short video in the next few days explaining it for you guys since alot have asked me o7
---
I wouldnt know, but I do know that people tend to not want resistance. Meaning every change CCP wants to make will be second guessed by themselves. Everything just got slower.
---
What is your in game name? Maybe sometime this weekend I can come out of Anoikis and help you run the Sisters of Eve Epic Ark.
---
After that if you dare we can dive into a wormhole.
---
Correct, adms and rental empires will start to fall in the next month.
---
I have super and caps.  There is not a FC in Providence I trust with my caps.  They are either Spies or Incompetent to allow so much welping.
---
Im still getting small gang fights in null. The last two days from morning till evening, non stop. 
---
But I dont find ratters or miners. Tbh not really interested in them when theres so many roaming gangs around to fight atm.
---
I also mined myself on an alt twice but die pretty quickly each time against cloakies.
---
Get an UW 34inch gaming screen with the excess budget. Thank me later ;)
---
In your opinion what do you think is the best noob friendly group where I can go to learn more about nullsec.
---
Wrong.
---
Do any of you have any friends to batphone? If you try again, make sure you get a couple, and see if you can‚Äôt get a few experienced pilots to help out too. Obviously getting experienced people with connections is harder than it sounds, but from what I have seen you were evicted mostly on accident by a bored wingspan pilot camping y‚Äôall. 
---
But if everyone in your Corp is a new player and you are trying to learn not only wormhole mechanics, but also Eve mechanics, then wormholes are not the place to be. Get some experience in FW lowsec or npc null, and once you have enough pilots with enough experience, move to wormholes. Having new players is fine, but what isn‚Äôt going to work is only having new players. You need a few vets capable of multiboxing a bit as well. 
---
Alternatively, live out of Thera until you get the hang of things, still a wormhole but no risk of eviction.
---
I think everyone agrees that having more expensive stuff in space is a good thing. Five years ago, you'd never have seen a Rorqual in a belt. Carriers were pretty much only used by bots and stupid people who got laughed at or fined when they died. Supers were coffins that spent most of the year logged off and unassailable. Null was boring, and groups like NCPL didn't even live in it - they just rented it out to worthless krab corps who were full of bots.
---
Nowadays, there are thousands of supers and rorquals in space, all of which are potential killmails. IMO that's a good thing. Hunting is way more interesting now than it ever was.
---
You say supercapital umbrellas are a problem, and yeah there may be problems, such as the consolidating of the players into isolated pockets (is that even a problem though? it's easier to hunt that way). But without a clear method for your typical EVE player to save their ship from a gank fleet, the smart ones just won't use them. You play this game by balancing risk vs reward. If you have no chance to save your Nyx from a dreadbomb in your own space, people just won't use them.
---
These ships are only in space to begin with BECAUSE of the super umbrella. A lot of people that complain about it really just want easy killmails handed to them. They should be careful about what they wish for, because if it drifts too far, null will just become dead again.
---
I'm curious as to what part of r/Eve convinced you to try a second time! As far as things go, I'm glad our descending spiral of bitterness enticed you so!
---
Personally I enjoyed the immersive experience of being and starting on my own and just reading a lot about the game myself. Not to sound unappreciative, but I  wouldnt have have liked such emails from GM as it would have broken that experience and immersion. Maybe I am weird..

I mean if you really want a laser cap use bonus that badly...
---
You can add to this Krab-rage im part of another aspect. New EVENT with skillpoints is f-word broken. Got stuck at first day. 
---
Undocked myrmidon for 10 minuts yesterday and randomly checked dscan one time and i saw combat probes at 5AU ;-) Never undocked again cause why should i try fighting infinite number of gankers, ill adapt with unsubing all alt accounts and krab with one account with ninja ratting or avoxing trivalgian invasion people.
---
&gt;I would say that based on the data, players face a greater barrier to entry into Eve Online when approaching the game as a solo operator with no prior experience.
---
Im not aware of such data. The blob is a dead end. You see this in null. You end up with a stagnant game.
---
&gt;I would say, that the data indicates that being in feets is removing that barrier of entry.
---
It does temporarily, but it also forces new players (or even older players) to join because they cant do anything otherwise. This reinforces the barrier.
---
&gt;What this indicates however, is that overall, the best case scenario for no change = a continuation of the 4% retention rate.
---
Apparently that 4% is after 30 days and given that the game is more dead now than 2-3 years ago, it seems the overall retention is negative.
---
&gt;That same data cites that players that participate within a community represent the largest portion of that current 4% (or retained players)
---
They dont have much choice.
---
&gt;If you don't socialise a player... They have less than a 4% chance of sticking around to be your content. Conversely, if you do, they have up to a 4% chance of sticking around. (With no changes made)
---
But the result is a dead game.
---
Any kind of reasonable ratting ship can not take on even 5 Lokis, in addition to the anom DPS, afk or not. And they usually don't live long enough to get help, even from an alert standing fleet.
---
The only defense for subcap ratter has always been to run away.
---
Is that shitty gameplay? Yeah, it is. But it's also the reality. And CCP isn't going to change the way anom ratting works any time soon.
---
There is [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5F3RCReOweuoBYQlV3OIPQ/videos) dude he has a couple videos with haw dreads. There are a couple of streamers/youtubers that have videos on that topic.
---
Im glad that the change improved your playstyle but what was stopping you from doing this pre-blackout? And ye I get it, necessity is the mother of invention, but nothing was stopping you. The same goes for the PvPers. 
---
Everyone wanted a more casual game, that was the problem. And things might be fun for a while but long term?
---
Totally agree and when I predicted that this would happen I got downvoted (and expect to be again by some of the vocal one dimensional PVP players),
---
Now, I have quite enjoyed some aspects of the Blackout, but I would say that the number of good fights that I have been in has not increased. In fact by far the best fight that I have had in the past few weeks was in Low Sec where of course Local still exists.
---
The obvious solution for people in the Blackout is to join one of the mega-coalitions. There, people can mine in Rorquals and if tackled PANIC and drop the super-cap umbrella. Not really the gamestyle that I am interested in and I believe not good for Eve as a whole.
---
What worries me most about the Blackout is that it is pandering to the aforementioned 1 dimensional PVP players who just want a 'shoot it up game'. For me the great attraction of Eve has always been the number of different strands that people can follow, and personally I like doing a bit of everything. I have seen a number of friends more focused on Mining/Industry/Exploration/PVE drop out of Eve over the past few weeks, and I fear that they will not return. The longer the blackout lasts the higher the likelihood that people will leave Eve on a permanent basis.
---
PVE ships melt because they are tanked to bare minimum to get maximum DPS out of them. Fit more tank and less dps. Also having a neut is huge killer for nearly any PVP ship as it kills the active tank and in some cases DPS output as well. I would like to mention that Large neut has range of 20-30km this kills sub bs cap real quick.
---
Perhaps i should have specified PvE combat more, however there are cases of people multiboxing 10+ clients in PvP. And duo/triple boxing isen't out of the ordinary in pvp.
---
I'm the CEO of a corp that runs a HS static c1 wh for production. Ive only been playing game for less than a year, but I'm pretty good at research.
---
Couple tips: 
---
-no matter what kind of wh you chose, read the eviction survival guide here on reddit (just search it) as it'll give you so good advice. The meta has changed slightly, but the basic principals appear to be the same. 
---
- Consider modding an Endurance for fast travel. If gas mining is your thing, I'm betting that you have t2 mining frigs trained. The Endrance has the largest ore capacity of any ship that can warp sub 2 seconds. A ship that has a sub 2 warp time is extremely difficult to catch, it's essentially immune to gate camping in both high and low sec. I say "essentually" immune because it can be caught, but not by conventional gate camping means, so it's a great ship to transport ore/gas with so long as you can stand the 15,000 m^3 limit.  Wh gas has a pretty high value per volume, so you'll want a ship for moving it quickly and safely through high/low sec. A prospect can do this very well too, but the endurance can cut your transport time by just a bit, especially if it's modded for fast warp time. 
---
-If you can do wh pi, do wh pi. Each omega account has three character slot, that's three characters per account that can do pi. It takes about 12 days to get a character up to level 4 pi skills, which can net you upwards of half a billion isk per month in wh space pi depending on your effort and the traffic. Since you'll have a station these characters can tether at in wh space, you'll be in a prime spot to do pi in there. Shit wh planets are about as good as decent low sec planets, or better. Pi in wh space is really really good. 
---
-Learn to pilot a Deep Space Transport (DST) well. The mighty DST, while not as glamorous as the blockade runner, is your best friend in regards to wh industry in a c1 or c2. Moving stuff is the biggest pain by far in wh industry. The wh can show up in the sticks for days on end.
---
Lastly, let me know if you just wanna join my group. I don't do reactions in my wh (yet) but there's no reason you cant. There's safety in numbers, and we can work you into our POCO deal (2.5% tax) as well as offer you some safety/docking/transport help. 
---
I'm a firm believe that gas miners are just good pilots in general, so I don't see why I wouldn't want you as at least a friend.
---
Great stats there mate. I have to agree with you though I will stick with exploration. You can close 200m+ an hour with a less than 100m isk ship.
---
I love the fact there's a guy puking in the toilet xD
---
To get to 4.5 sites an hour you need to manually select at least half your drone targets and constantly use your HAM's. Thrones not auto aggroing would not change much for me. Probably would only manage 4 filaments a hour while exchanging attention between eve and netflix. I dont oppose drone auto aggro at all, i think it wil be good for the game
---
drop your ingame name and I'll toss you enough ISK for 5 slicer fits to get you started
---
also, you should definitely watch chessurs/abkillers videos, they have tons of good slicer footage
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/ChessurSB/videos
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa3DmmHcI_oNrHts5o2I5Iw/videos
---
slicer is stupid hard to fly, but it will teach you a ton of things about pvp while you learn it. executioner does not really compare in ability.
---
JUST USE A FUCKING CLOAK IF YOU WANT TO BE COMPLETELY INVISIBLE HOLY SHIT.
---
Think of Dscan Inhibs as a Taunt-type mechanic against hostiles. It's supposed to be there as a sign saying, "HEY, I AM HERE, COME AND DEAL WITH ME OR ELSE". If I wanted to completely disappear from DSCAN, I'd just use a cloak because those already exist.
---
&gt; No if you get a red sphere from scanning it means the sig is on the far side of the sphere from where you just scanned
---
Yeah but explaining what to do with your probes for the best result of this is more than i can explain i'm not the best with words.
---
&gt;The sig is somewhere on the edge of the sphere but when you load a new system with no scans done it's best to do 4AU sweeps of the planets like comments above say.
---
This is not a best practice and will confuse new players if it's the only thing they know. It breaks down completely in large systems.
---
Hahaha yea  but that teacher has like 54 days if not more off     unlike us we probably get half

Yea  a sea without fish    i try to avoid amsterdam if i can   it just sucks there
---
Well, it is worth with a group you enjoy to play with. You can ask Corp recruiters what they do and decide accordingly.
---
1) Dropping titans in a response fleet is pretty dumb, because there's always a risk of a double escalation. Supercarriers are far better value.
---
2) HAWs on titans are pretty awful now anyway. Again, you're better off dropping a supercarrier
---
3) Even without support fighters, a supercarrier group can still force any subcapital fleet off grid, given sufficient numbers. They just won't kill very much.
---
4) A good standing fleet isn't relying on supercarrier fighters for tackle, because frankly, sirens are borderline garbage and unreliable as hell. You bridge in subcapital tackle to hold down the targets for the supercarriers to mulch.
---
5) FAX's exist
---
So no, none of that would make any difference as far as umbrella effectiveness is concerned.
---
My newbro experience was different.  When you jumped you ended up in the middle of a system uncloaked, while your screen loaded for at least 30 seconds.  Not invulnerable.  I set a way point to check out dangerous space two jumps I was handled by Zombie corp and back station before screen loaded.  Did get to hear myself blowing up though :).   Then I got ganked again and lost half my skills
---
Excellent. I fit scrams to my ratting Myrmidons. :)
---
Even worse : you are shooting kinetic rockets, so the 2nd highest Drake resist wtf. At least if you shooted EM but no lol
---
ur gaypwned
---
Gee, luckily nobody is able to have a bunch of alts with cynos that they can just log off in a pocket / dead end and worry about leaving it for a few days.
---
If anything there needs to be MORE reasons to come to null. All those thousands of people who live in highsec need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into lowsec/nullsec/wormholes where they can actually contribute something to the game that isn't just mindlessly grinding missions or incursions.
---
Well it seems that the only way to fix this is the "retarded" idea to spread out ships coming from cyno to 10AU area around the beacon.
---
This is exactly why account sharing is against the ToS. So CCP doesn't need to deal with people that get screwed after giving their logins away. Prime example right here.
---
Kinda meta but it's amusing as hell here how the death of a krab is invoked with a crab.
---
Why didn't you do that before the blackout?
---
Bud that all sounds awesome, would love to visit your country some day soon. Enjoy!

That's why we have daily downtimes, so the game can clean up lost objects in space. Ships included.
---
I assume you mean Stabber? Because Scythe FI is pretty strong.
---
&gt; which are generally used fairly quickly
---
[No, they're not](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/5lP7CyKgU8K9582EykBbQd/394548e22ab4c04028290d8f3d164dce/0_produced.vs.destroyed.png_w=900&amp;fm=jpg&amp;fl=progressive)
---
&gt;the amount of isk in circulation 
---
[It is going down, slightly.](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/4aEmnvffst3ilL9hSHTaK7/4fd848a14dd2f0b4591eeb3dcbb71a7c/9a_sinksfaucets.png)
---
If you're an alpha and you knew the nerfs to drones would hit, why did you still skill into those skills? Even if you had skilled into them already you wouldn't have been able to make use of them.
---
Ships don't dissapear after downtime, dude
---
Medium Capacitor Booster II and his friend Navy Cap Booster 800 would like a word with you.
---
It means more certainty that the ship your attack at least can't drop a capital fleet on you.
---
If recons can fit cynos but a battlecruiser can't then you more likely to be able to engage it without having to alt tab out to check pilot history.
---
If it's the only ship in system then it's definitely not going to be a cyno bait.
---
Uties would not be capable of fitting a cyno so an inties would have to tackle you and even with a recon you'd have a chance to kill it more so than a cyno BC.
---
Mother of Bob, yes please.
---
Giving a reason to come to null will only revert back to your other complaint. Only big corps hold enough firepower to make null safe. No high sec players are stupid enough to choose the riskier option. They would just join a large Corp to minimize risk.
---
When you do  you should definantly try to go outside of amsterdam hehehe
---
Aww he wrote you poetry!
---
KarmaFleet does corp roams in EU and US TZ where they just take out silly ships or an actual "doctrine" but the fleets are rarely larger then 25 in EU TZ. They were good fun. They were also staged from the edge of Imperium space so there was no capital umbrella to bathphone. 
---
Most Goons corps do corp roams or small fleets with squads for this exact reason, they are not interested in blobbing either because it is not interesting. However if goons ping for a strat-op fleet, yeah they will blob to get the objective done more easy.
---
Yea that time when you locked the rats but forgot to select them
---
&gt; However, they're going to mine with Miner IIs, not excavators.
---
you say that like it's a bad thing
---
Well, the umbrella is a very potent defense mechanism. As long as the capital-subcap balance is like this, the umbrella will be the answer to all changes..
---
However, this is not a problem of the blackout, but one of the resource availability as well as the capital-subcap balance!
---
If this balance is finally fixed, the blackout helps to reset the stage a little bit. Since traps can be executed much better with the blackout than without.
---
So please do not blaim a situation at something, when the underlying problem is something different.
---
So i will say it again.      
---
Before this power creep started a my "properly fit PVE dominix that had neuts" got tackled by 3 cruisers and a frigate. 2 cruisers were T2  ^(checked the kill and it was HYDRA RELOADED)       
---
I was able to survive for like 15min as i was constantly forcing one of the attacking cruisers to warp off thanks to neuts and drones ... while mostly tanking other two.             
---
           
---
You will have no chance to do it now even on full fit - you will melt.        
---
It is due to how strong current ships are now.     
---
Again this was well fit PVE domi as the rats where doing almost omni damage and due to prolonged fight RAH filled the gap against the atackers.
---
Newbro like me?  
---
Since you are likely to be solo, maybe not the whole full fledged structure. Prepare an alpha account (or more) with three of its toons in sunesis (for the scanning bonus). make them your scout.  
---
Every time you want to daytrip to C3, you log in in one of the toon, scan both static, get your site runner from highsec home all the way into C3 this way. Run the site, and back to HS, like usual daytripping.  
---
If your scout ambushed, wait a day to a week to make sure it safe to get the second scout get a way for your first scout in to the C2 again.  
---
This way, you wont need any structure to maintain or defend. While got three layer of scout as safety measure (or as much as you like with many C2 with HS/C3 static since you can do this with theoretical infinite amount of alpha accounts). Many people live off C13 like this.  
---
Someone give me idea to use some alpha freighter and bowhead (omega them for a month and let them lapsing to alpha to just use the cargo/maintenance bay and never docking) for nomaden structureless life like this. Tho I still search about the omega alpha lapse mechanic. Are they can use the cargo or bay to store stuff? can they jump thru the WH? is it really possible?
---
Your ratting ticks count for more.  Your existing isk stops inflating so hard.  We'll be a little less like tranquility with their 20b isk to plex an account.
---
It'll be easier to afford plex.
---
Honestly it'll probably balance out.  The isk in the game is only on a slight downward trend, and the value of minerals will rise a bit as well.  Those will probably even out.  It'll just mean that ratting and mining will be more worthwhile, probably mostly because you won't be competing with bots that run 23 hours a day and reduce the value of your isk and your time.
---
CCP has steadily killed all the gameplays that didn't revolve around super risk-averse highsec ISK-grinding, highsec market pvp, and big block sovnull (i.e. krabbing under the umbrella, with the occasional bout of F1 monkeying).  
---
You should stop believing there is a reservoir of people waiting to be shown their cubicle in the Tapirium: why should the proportion of highsec players willing to move to nullsec be any higher than before?
---
I like increasing the MWD cooldown on fighters to 5 minutes or so.  It means after they blow their fighter MWD, you can just warp to the other side of the supers away from the fighter blob.
---
It keeps supers just as powerful if you land at 0 on them, so don't do that in subcaps.
---
Which helps new guys as well. I‚Äôm all up for deflation even though I don‚Äôt mine or rat
---
Slight inflation or deflations should both be fine.
---
Either is preferable to this:
---
https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/tWWzngWbGPYGtE57HSLrO/5208b051293a5ca4e8fbb18a9c45ab93/9b_isk.float.3.png
---
20% per year is a bit much.
---
Can confirm. E-Uni has some of everything besides SovNull.
---
Advantage: There are people who have experience with basically everything in the game. Mining fleets with boosts occur pretty much daily in the various campuses which occupy High-Sec space (which includes Low-Sec Campus, which has a lot of Athanors set up in a 0.5 system so that everyone's Orca alts can be happy), shared can operations are less common but still frequent, also frequent mining operations outside of High-Sec. Plenty of small-gang operations. Impressive industrial base by the standards of not-SovNull. Plenty of fun people USTZ and EUTZ. No matter what you're doing, there will be people helping you do it better.
---
Disadvangage: Most of the experienced FC's have moved on, so you're not going to be finding many big-ship fleets until the current FC's build up confidence and experience with frigate fleets to move beyond just "flood the enemy's overview with Merlins orbiting at 500" tactics (but there are at least a few fleets like that per week). The last two fleets which did something beyond that were former Uni members coming back to lead training fleets as guest FC's: a battle Exequeror fleet that got close to the top of r/Eve last week or the week before and nearly killed a carrier before more capitals showed up when the fleet crossed paths with Fweddit (did kill a Drekavac and a Magus, ensuring that the fleet would be ISK-positive even if it whelped, which it didn't), a Rupture fleet last night which died pretty much as soon as it entered Providence because it was in the way of a larger Cerberus fleet (looking at the killmails, one of the people in the Cerberus fleet did a Uni guest lecture on ProviBloc's history and political situation, the general consensus being that it was interesting, but seemed like a propaganda/recruiting pitch even by *EVE* standards). We don't have the supercapital umbrella or infrastructure hub upgrades of a SovNull empire so the Null-Sec Campus is neither as safe or as profitable as what Goonswarm offers (the main protection being that Syndicate isn't exactly the busiest region in the game).
---
Also, see that thing about guest FC's who used to be in the Uni? [The whole Uni has been laughing about this since Monday.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77976763/) Joint fleet with Fweddit (FC used to be in the Uni). Went to Delve in Atrons and Comets. Took down a capital and several ships of the response fleet (before the rest of the Goons responding crawled off in embarrassment that they couldn't deal with a frigate fleet). No ship losses in that entire fleet. Goon comms must have been hilarious.
---
E-Uni is the best place for new players.
---
I disagree that thousands of Rorquals in space make for better content. Just because it's a bigger killmail doesn't mean it's more interesting content, it mostly means you need a bigger group to take it down. That is not automatically the same as more, let alone better, content.  
---
This is not to argue against people flying ships in space, mind you. I am just disagreeing with the assumption that more expensive stuff in space automatically means more, or better, content.
---
Haha oh I thought you meant you were from Norway and just going further north. I went to Amsterdam when I was 18...now I‚Äôm older I‚Äôd do things differently :)
---
If incursions are so attractive how come the count of incursionrunners declined harder over the years than the playercount?
---
If i remember right the damage T2 ships do now si pretty much the same as i was back then. What comes to triglavian ships they will also shutdown under heavy neut quite nicely. Ofc i doesnt really help the current meta that you have to build your PVP ship to super max DPS to be able to kill the target faster than the 200 super that are about to drill your swamp ass the moment cyno goes up.
---
They removed 2 of the 3 spawns, for a start.
---
See below, but I'm not talking about number of users, just ease of use, which hasn't changed, and, if necessary, can be continued for the same amounts of risk free isk as previous.
---
Idk, can they?
---
Once the 15 minute anchoring completes, it is then invulnerable for 24 hours while it finishes setting up (assuming this in lowsec space - it varies in sovnull depending on strategic index).
---
After that 24 hour period is over it again has a 15 minute repairing cycle before it is formally 'deployed'. The citadel can straight be killed in either of these 15 minute windows. After that, even if low power, it will generate a reinforce timer.
---
Was on eve north in toronto in june + a couple days off work before and after including a concert in cologne at the end. There went my summer vacation :) And since the weather was pretty nice, i considered it already as good summer time. 
---
Now temperatures rised above 40¬∞C and thats just uncomfortable for me outside, so i am not sad to sit in a good climated office (no AC, it's just good based on location in the house) :)
---
I was about to say this. The Imperium is almost as far from a feudal as you can get.
---
I wonder if you can explain how a vast over supply of ISK has driven Plex prices higher. I always thought that oversupply of an item caused its value/worth to drop. If you factor in the sales that CCP has on a regular basis of Plex would this not add further liquidity to the market and thus depress prices.
---
 You say deflation is a good thing in financial markets, however in the real world as you acknowledge a small inflation rate is much better for the markets would not this missive deflationary pressure cause a dislocation of the entire economy of eve.
---
Also eve is a sealed system and unlike the real world people do not need to "suck it up" when things go poorly they simply stop playing thus creating more deflationary pressure and a death spiral of less players more deflation etc.
---
You didn't have then stuff like hecate ^(also triglavian stuff)       
---
Gila was also not so fucking OP like it is now.         
---
Just to give you an example what is wrong.      
---
Like roaming cruiser had 400dps  ... so a single hecate can be equal to 2 of the old cruisers in terms of dps.
---
&gt;Unfortunately they patched this so bookmarks inside a celestial warp you to zero instead of inside.
---
I think this explains everything. Is there a way to get it round? Or this ship is doomed to stay there until end of times?
---
it would have to be build in orbit. having the main structure built around the rotating habitat.
---
i image for smaller ships they would just have it turning slower so you have lover gravity but still some
---
Enjoying tidi and entosis f1 fleets much?
---
Your comment is stupid af. Can‚Äôt you already probe a relic site where someone is hacking with probe scanner? It would be exactly the same thing. You probe not the ship directly but the site where there is activity.
---
That combo actually looks ideal from a gas mining perspective- c2 for HS access, c5 for top end gas. In general how desirable/sought after would such a WH be to corps?
---
&gt;Some regions have dropped to massively reduced or no activity. Those regions are bot paradise, and that is no loss whatsoever to the game. 
---
Yes, because everyone who doesn't want to get dropped by coverts or doesn't have a hand full of alts to camp gates must be a bot.
---
Just because it isn't content for you, with your corp-level roaming op or whatever, doesn't mean it's not content for a larger group. Both are important.
---
People get pissed off about rorquals because they can't kill them with their 10-man roaming fleet. But why should they be able to?
---
Meanwhile, Rorquals die literally every day to wormhole whaling fleets, bombers bar, alliance-level black ops fleets, or just alliances punching through opportunistic wormholes.
---
L O L @ op
---
Plex is a Giffon good. As the price rises, so does demand. This happens precisely because inflation is eve is rampant yet prices are static. A marauder used to cost 1 plex when they were 1b, now theyre 2b and marauders hulls cost the same, so you can buy two hulls for 1 plex. Minerals are not inflating like plexes are (hell some are going down over the years) so this applies too all player-made objects. 
---
No, I say deflation is a good thing for Eve, for now. Not for financial markets. 
---
Eve's market can be normalised without people quitting, by keeping the blackout and reworking risk vs reward. 
---
Player counts are either static or slowly reducing over the period above and plex prices don't care, they rampage onwards.
---
Hehehe  yea  im dutch     
---
I hope to visit scotland once  when it doesnt rain
---
Tables with numbers !         
---
We like tables with numbers!
---
My point is you don't have to anom ratting, they don't want people anom ratting they want people doing more active pve, not being able to either afk or bot. If you're playing you should be actively playing.
---
I didn't say anything about joining an alliance, or umbrellas, or anything.
---
I said I'd rather have people doing stuff in space where they can die (nullsec) to players, thereby generating 'content,' and have appropriate incentive to do so. As opposed to virtually risk-free highsec activities.
---
If the risk:reward ratio in nullsec drifts too far to the risk side, which no local unarguably does for subcap ratting, as an example, then people will just find safer things to do.
---
Chances are - it will not stay that way.
---
I mean... There are corps that will be happy to have you.
---
But then you spend time with them.
---
Do some mining.
---
Camp a gate.
---
Get droped by a roaming Titan because guy was bored.
---
Aannddd you spend 3 hours a day and grumble when log ofd time comes.
---
In Denmark the so called industry holidays are the weeks 28, 29, 30 and I'll be needing to change my sleeping pattern and go back to work soon... My holidays went on Eve and binging.
---
That's promising to hear! I would definitely use DST for transporting out reaction and PI products, probably safest bet.
---
Yea here its also like 40C its just horrible weather   way to hot
---
Or they simply get the same or more isk safer, because risk vs reward in eve is still completely upended.
---
Wasn't the gila nerfed some time a go? Also im not 100% sure how neuts apply to T3Ds but from my understanding even hecate should shutdown maybe not with large neut but medium should do it. Also one problem that i have noticed with a lot of BSs is that they normaly have only 1 utility high. Because of this you normally need to pick between 1 large neut or 1 medium neut depending what you are going to engage with it.
---
We do get a lot of ticket replies with "Thanks General Manager". &gt;.&lt;
---
Ah too late, we just had our 3 days of sun and last night was thunder and lightning ) 
---
But it‚Äôs beautiful all seasons, sometimes more so in the rougher weather.
---
Incursions were one of the points you stated as being too high income, i objected that point as obviously the income of them isn't attractive enough to hold a lot of people.
---
I'm all for better PVE, but it doesn't exist in nullsec.
---
That change happened very recent, the decline in incursions has been going on for much longer.
---
Ah we have them here  but here its only the co struction workers that close for like 2 to 3 weeks   and some busineses that close for 2 weeks
---
His flair says wormholer, so dont expect much in the way of reason from him
---
11/10, outstanding work.
---
A major issue with null bots was how much they tank the value of isk, limiting bots to PVE that generates less or even no direct isk is a great help.
---
Group pve is fine, if the reward is equal or higher to the solo alternative.
---
My main issue with group pve is trying to fit it around other people's timetable and a lack of ability to just drop in and out when I want.
---
Did you check the price of marauder hulls recently?...
---
And when he starts getting serious Isk you backstab him
---
You can still do 700+ dps easily ... with huge tank.          
---
Yes you can shut down hecate with neuts, but try to lock something with so small signature before dying.           
---
If such ship decide to do bounce on some ongrid perch when you lock it ... well have fun locking it again.              
---
It is never one thing that give the final effect but combination of many.
---
This post is dumb as fuck. If you cant kill shit with no local, having local is not gonna help you. I killed a titan a few days ago because of no local and we have been hazing multiple caps. If you cant find the krabs right now I don't know what to tell you but you're just bad at eve.
---
Just waiting for the day people like OP sack up and ask for what they really want. A ship that is invisible and doesnt show up on dscan or in local or on the overview that can still attack that offers zero risk to the hunter and instagibs everyone including supers and titans. Of course this is the only logical step because of course nullsec is meant to be dangerous.
---
well, running incursions vs super ratting in safe space. 
---
i suspect there are gonna be more incursion runners now.
---
10 people is a massive understatement. Before the change that reduced rorq shield tank slightly, you would need something crazy like 100~ cruisers to break the tank of one. Not considering how they have 6 minutes of complete invulnerability and the potential to call in a cap fleet of their own anytime. I remember catching rorqs with no contest, and it still taking 30-40 minutes to kill it in a 30 man gang with bhaalgorns due to cap ancils (thankfully that fit is gone now) or double/triple cap booster memes.
---
Kotton remarks on r/eve?
---
Exactly as planned. 
---
Big blobs empowered even more, small guys can go fuck themself again.
---
Well people still want to do incursions but groups that did it died out.      
---
People quit, moved to null ( i know like 3 incursion fcs atm that are in null now) and no one replaced them.              
---
The problem with incursion is that it require people willing to lead it ... but at the same time when it actually starts there is to many people willing to join, so most of them have to wait ^(and this is no fun)
---
The content is out there it's just mouth breathers cant find it.
---
One thing that is funny to me is that for years the "delete local" crowd has been all one note (get rid of local, that will fix null) for years and when it happens some of the same people are "well, no one thing is going to fix null, there are lots of things that need fixing!!!"...  We If CCP changes something else in null like cynos or jump bridges or whatever, the same people will just shift over to some other excuse for why it didn't work like they thought it would.
---
Likewise, in the 1st 2 weeks of the blackout many of us said it would have negative consequences down the road, that probably won't be seen for a while. Many who like the black out kept talking about how great it was and how this is a new era and you are just whining you useless krab.
---
Now that large parts of null are dead in week the the same people who were celebrating are saying "it's only been THREE WEEKS, we need to see how it plays out"...
---
That's a disappointing thing to hear. I think your coalition is doing quite well and has created a great place to play the game.  Our local conflict is excellent with losses and victories traded routinely for both sides.  Personally I assert that there isn't a more enjoyable place to play eve.
---
"Oh noes, I want to play a MMO with thousands of real players but I don't want to adjust to their timetable."  
---
Single-player games are that way ---&gt;
---
/spit
---
Some might understand üòÅ
---
Yes and ability do run triglavian sites paying more than supper ratting in higsec, with instanced PVE totally falls into "risk vs reward"             
---
Same for stuff like broken burner missions ... when you can make again more than in a ratting super ... int a 200mil frigate.        
---
^(or buch of 10mil ones if you have enough alts).
---
those fits are pretty terrible...
---
what are you going to do with 3 cap boosters on a buffer fit? one of them even capital sized?
---
get some more range in there
---
the active fit is just bloating costs with meta guns and meta  cap boosters factor 3-5) and is missing a neut (wich might be ok since you will lack powergrid but a  tradeoff might be to replace one capital sized injector and one tracking comp with two heavy cap boosters.
---
The?
---
Yeah I mean, I was hunting those triple ancil Rorquals too, they were broken as shit.
---
But at least there was something in space that was worth them forming up to save for. We got some good fights and ganks out of it. Sometimes we wouldn't get the rorqual, but we'd get a few faxes and bomb their response fleet to death or something. Despite the stupidly broken tank, I still had fun hunting them.
---
And now their tank is neutered, so they're in a better place.
---
If you want to make barely any isk like null has always been then yes.
---
I can't say anything about TDF but WTM waiting times are seemingly close to nonexistant.   
---
I do agree though that theres not many people left that actually *want* to lead incursion fleets. Then again, if there were enough people interested in actually running them there should be some more people emerging from the crowd that want to FC them. So i'd say your theory is only half correct.
---
I came to jump around.. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhzpxjuwZy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhzpxjuwZy0)
---
You must be high.  ProviBloc is a frog sitting in water with the slowly . . . reaching . . . boil . . . point.  Cap escalations we can't match.  No central leadership.  Low ADMs due to BO exodus.  Red citadels in every other system or more.  Slowly losing space to to AU TZ reds.
---
But it did, Branch and other region notorious for VNI bots are dead. I have had a tonne of fun with blackout and  I hope it doesn't go back to the way it was and gets iterated on. 
---
The one concern I had going into it was that it would make players who don't have a carrier lives harder, this has pretty much born true.
---
I didn't say that at all
---
If I have a short space of time to play, a few anoms were fine for that.
---
If I have say, an hour, to kill if absolutely everything was a group activity then you're going to spend most of that time getting  group together, if anyone is even about, and at that point it just isn't worth the time.
---
Not everyone has an identical schedule with 6 consecutive uninterrupted hours free.
---
Isn't that a great feeling? It is the human connection, to rely on and to be relied on that makes EVE great.
---
A lot of us are just enjoying the tables being turned for the first time since 2016. While local being gone swings too far towards the attacker, we cant go back to how it was either, as it heavily favoured the defender. 
---
And about the ez kills bit... isnt that why you would join the biggest alliances in the game?
---
Wicked Creek and Detorid are good for active people, they have streaming alts on most the gates though which can make roaming p annoying.
---
Yeah for sure. Id be extremely happy if they removed panic though, eve has no place for invulnerability on ships.
---
Thanks for the reply, you say Plex is a Giffon Good I take it that you equate Plex to something which is such an item I wonder if you could tell me what that item is. I have always been under the impression that evidence for a Giffon good was limited in real life but could be proved in some mathematical models.
---
Once the genie of deflation is out of the bottle it can be hard to put it back. I am unaware of anyone ever intentionally deflating an economy and the risk of spill over into the wider eve economy is high, also how would you prevent deflation from continuing. 
---
The changes you propose to risk reward and the remodeling of the income stream would adversely impact newer players (less ISK) and benefit older players who have more liquid isk, how would you mitigate the impact of this.
---
What are you going to drink other than salty tears? Water?
---
Everyone appears in local as normal.
---
Display of a person in local is delayed 1 second for every anomaly of any kind that despawns each hour.
---
Systems being farmed 23/7 will give you crazy time to scan them down, low kill systems provide an easy way to keep tabs on your home systems.
---
You still eventually find out where things are and can react, but botting basically leaves you in blackout local for all intents and purposes.
---
‚ÄúNothin was stopping pvp pilots‚Äù
---
Yeah except for you know, local? The immediate and instantaneous intel system that caused said supers and ratters to immediately dock up?
---
No the purpose of that topic at all. You stopped at my first example I suppose. What do you make of the new player who, in a T1 exploration hull, could make a living out of scanning wrecks and looting them
---
That works great, my own small alliance/group is doing the same thing. It's fun for a while.
---
Problem is its driven more out of defiance than practicality. Eventually people learn that doing that is much less income than other things they could be doing (like burners or abyssals or incursions/invasions in high sec). Those carrier pilots fleet banging anoms will put up with those 17 mil ticks for only so long before they do something else...
---
Still people will group up like this during prime time and go at it and shoot the shit on comms.  But the players who end up playing off prime time won't be able to do that. So instead of building up the group in another time zone you end up losing people to existing groups that all ready have a presence in that time zone.  
---
Meanwhile, looking at dotlan and setting it to npcs killed per hour, nothing has changed at all in places like Delve...
---
&gt;I think everyone agrees that having more expensive stuff in space is a good thing.
---
I don't. In fact that's a big part of the problem right now. Without these huge expensive assets your ability to affect nullsec is practically zero, which pushes everyone into an endless arms race. More FAX. More Titans. More supers. Less subcaps. Less accessible PVP for everyone. Have a titan? Crab for a second one. Have two? Crab for a third.
---
What this does is raise the barrier of entry into PVP ever higher. Whether it's solo roaming or alliance level sov bashing, it's all being skewed toward escalation levels that few entities in the game can match. Where we'd otherwise have diverse standing fleets out in space we have capital alts sitting in a staging citadel. Where we'd otherwise have gangs camping gates we have one titan alt ready to boson them. This is not an improvement. 
---
A dreadbomb, btw, is just another kind of gank. The best case scenario for this meta is that people deploy dozens of suicide dread bombs into places like Delve, basically just excav bombing on a greater scale. And if you can't deploy dread bombs like that you can't take part at all. That's our vision for PVP now?
---
Back in my day it was all about "good posting", now it seems to have boiled over into memes and cats
---
Both are important and both had them before now nonbloc level content is getting to it's lowest point because everyone is rorqual mining/super ratting.

V0kan had a good reply about the roaming gang argument that no one uses.
---
Who *doesn't* hit F1 to fire their guns?
---
Sorry about the delay. Sadly that's a negative. I had to make some modifications to the in-game file and sharing that around is not okay under the EULA. Also, the modifications are poorly made and would still require quite a few hours with a soldering iron to patch up.
---
Long story short: I can't, and if I could you'd find the results disappointing.
---
:popcorn:

Don't use excavs and just use Miner 2's
---
I have it bound to one of my extra mouse buttons.
---
Most of the newbies don't even know that there is something like incursion groups.          
---
Ok honest stuff here.          
---
When i started to play eve :                 
---
* i was flying in higsec in a tengu for a 7 months before i learned that there is something like EVE Uni ... and people there actually could help me learn stuff                  
---
* i learned that there is something like incursions after like a year of gameplay ... only because one spawned in my "back yard"         
---
OK those were old days ... and when i think about it now THE AGENCY is actually good addition for new players.           
---
Compare the Trig and Sansha incursion.           
---
You can do the Trig incursions in actually almost any ship with bunch of friends ... but you cannot touch sansha incursion without a **proper setup**                   
---
Sure you can take some newbies in basic ships  when you have your core already formed ... but at the peek point in incursion fleets **you didn't wanted to do it** as each newbie was reducing your isk/h.             
---
Lets be honest the incursions were quite toxic at the end and people were bested for doing stuff that was reducing the isk/h to the point that many stopped to play.             
---
Like the basic fit for incusion ship became like 3-4bil ...
---
Garmur for all  the team ones..
---
&gt; It went very well until I managed to **piss off a director by posting** (not offensive in any way) **memes**
---
What kind of memes?
---
&gt;. **I argued with him** and then got the boot
---
  I think you discovered why your app was thrown out
---
And how is "Hydra reloaded" recruiting more people?
---
Yeah,I konw that. But I want a fitting for the agent ons.
---
Even for the base ones.
---
Good luck
---
Pushing whoever is currently not a bittervet from nullsec to any other space is more getting them to leave the game than interesting.
---
Grouping up wont help unless your corp just always has a bunch of people who need to rat and all have time at the same time, the thing that's good about ratting , or was good about ratting is that you could do it when you had a spare half hour, which isnt always going to be at the same time other people have a spare half hour, this will hurt smaller alliances and as others have suggested push more people into the big blocks.
---
Honestly i'v had more kills in the last few weeks than I have for ages so I have to say I'v been loving the PvP side of eve of late, but I also love to mine, and rat the game will die for me if I am logging in and doing just one thing every day that would kill it for me, I need to do a bunch of stuff it helps stave off burn out its important, with the black out I'm already getting PvP fatigue, and I know others are as well.
---
Personally I need to chilled out down time that pve brings so I can then enjoy and afford the pvp that's around, I'm not sure what the solution is but if the black out continues more people are going to dock up, less people will be roaming because their running out of funds to replace ships and the buzz will ware off.
---
I‚Äôd like to point out my opinion that mineral prices are not skyrocketing because people have been stockpiling for years and are selling their stocks now. Just my opinion.
---
Idk blackout has only lead to me having more "GFs" then Ganks since more is bait in lower populated regions.
---
Before it was mainly roaming around killing VNI's with the very odd actual fight every now and then though the amount of actual fights I've ran into has drastically increased if I don't roam in block space.
---
It breaks about 100km off the athanor.
---
You can mark it to see how far of it is then time how long it takes to move 1km closer, then you can calculate how long is left.
---
There might be easier ways i dont know about.
---
I think there should be viable outlets for both subcap and capital PVE, not just a steady progression from VNI -&gt; supercarrier. That's why this local thing is annoying; it's just largely killing off, or at least disincentivizing nullsec subcap PVE.
---
But I still want supers out in space doing stuff. Roaming through hostile space killing endless VNI's is dumb and boring to me. Dropping dreads is still just ganking, yeah, but it's fun.
---
Think of all the multi-super ganks that have happened when a bunch of dumb krabs get baited out in their supers, and then suddenly 100-150 dreads appear. That kind of thing isn't possible when they're all docked up in a keepstar.
---
Ah, so if players link their "fire guns" button to something other than F1, they're elite pvp? Brb, setting SHOOT to my CAPS LOCK key
---
Thats too bad, but thx for the honesty
---
I hit F3, F1 is the warp disruptor. You F1 monkeys are the lowest form of life in New Eden. We F3 lions are the true elites.
---
Yes, this drives newbies out of nullsec and maybe out of the game.    
---
They can't do anything in subcaps without being hunted by some cloaky shit. No mining, no ratting, not even PI, because there is a bomber next to the customs office.
---
The problem is that as soon as someone starts ratting outside of an umbrella the hunters will see that, even if they are on the other side of map and will congregate to that region and then find the sucker and kill him. This fog of war idea isn't a thing as long as these kinds of information is easily available. Everything is sewed so much towards the "hunters" that it's discouraging anyone from doing anything.
---
Before anyone says that it was too skewed the other direction, I know but that doesn't change the fact that right now anything you do is way to visible. I personally like the blackout but I'm biased since it makes my playstyle easier.
---
You can use Skill Extractors.
---
&gt;sack up and ask for what they really want
---
Are you a brainlet? 
---
We already have a probe that scans down ships. They're called combat probes. 
---
Man just wants probes to scan down wrecks. What's wrong with that?
---
Then the answer isn't 'delete rorquals', it's 'give barges a unique role'
---
ditto with supercarriers vs VNI's
---
Either way, no-local disproportionately hurts subs.
---
brb setting shoot to my caps lock key
---
Do i have to pay for it?
---
How much skill points i can take out?
---
Difference being that you dont need to fight supers, you can just warp out. Blops bridging in no local means you have no counter. 
---
So no people arent complaining about cynos or jump drives, people are complaining about the lack of counterplay. That the risk to the blops crew is more or less non existing atm.
---
And besides, we would have the same complaints about the umbrella without supers, subcap fleets can still be bridged and people would still meet a blob they cant fight.
---
The real problem is that people dont seem o understand that the old Eve is dead. You simply cant balance small gang with big gang anymore. The gap is too wide in terms of manpower, firepower and isk.
---
I think anoms and deds need lot of attention. You can already group up and run havens and incursions or abyssals and I would like to see more invasion type of sites, perhaps cyno jam the systems in null and add them there.
---
Just beware the diminishing returns when injecting again.
---
Oh no. Nullsec is dangerous. The horror...
---
oh okay
---
You can use skill extractors, fill them up by selecting skills you don't want anymore. After that the skill extractor will be turned to skill injector which will yeld specific amount of unalocated skillpoints depending on your overall skillpoints amount:
---
    0 to 5 million Skill Points at time of use = 500.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
    5-50 million Skill Points at time of use = 400.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
    50-80 million Skill Points at time of use = 300.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
    80 million or more Skill Points at time of use = 150.000 unallocated Skill Points
---
Yes, either with isk or buy with rl money in next store. You can extract down to 5.5m SP.

Google works well you know..

The Serpentis Burner can be done in a Hawk Assault Frig with Rockets. Not optimal as you lack a little dps and it takes 1 reload and a little heat, but it works reliable. Lowslots Faction BCU, Medslots a Web with 60% speed malus and at least 12km range (faction or abyssal) a target painter, deadspace small Shieldbooster and deadspace Thermal Resist. Cant remember Rigs atm, but i think it was missile rigs for projection.

---
Learn on your mistake.           
---
Orca is actually good ship that you can use for moving ships and stuff.             
---
Consider those facts :               
---
* running buriner mission in higsec can give you 120mi/h                
---
* running them outside of higsec only scales up          
---
* relics in proper area can offer you 100mil+/ site if you are lucky    
---
* ninja salvaging in trig incursions can offer few hundred mills /day if you are good            
---
* salvaging after super in some big alliance in nullsec is like 100mi/h                 
---
* you can do instanced trig sites and slowly scale up to make more and more isk as you go to harder sites ... and you can start in a T1 cruiser.  In T5 we are talking 200-300mil/h                      
---
There is more, but those things you can do as newbie.
---
For the Gurista Burner you can take a Worm, pretty much pimped tbh. Pretty much anything on this boat has to be deadspace a-type or faction, better good abyssal rolls especially for the MWD.
---
This.
---
On your first point, Its almost as if you're measuring your success in this game with how much income you make, rather than how much fun you're having.
---
People don't say just adapt as if it will be a improvement.
---
We just do it because that's what we have been told for the last 3 years as the game gets safer and safer and more play styles are slaughtered but you don't care so "just adapt".
---
Moving income streams is good too I don't know why people want to slave when you could almost make more making shoes in some third world country. I already out sourced my mine to lowsec 1bil/hr with vni level effort after picking up missions.
---
It's actually hauntingly accurate how EvE economy responds to rl central bank monetary policy. Grade A tinfoilery right here.
---
Nope.
---
&gt; and the content I find is generally of better quality (other subcap gangs).
---
This could have happened before.... there was literally nothing stopping you all except that all they easy kills and thus incentive to roam wasn't there.
---
Thanks for your input.
---
&gt;new option for hunters. You could probe wrecks with core probes instead of probing ships with combat probes. It makes it more difficult for ratters to identify a hunter in system
---
\^\^ His suggestion bud
---
no point reading past there when it would serve as yet another buff to risk averse ganking and nerf to actual fights
---
I mean you only have to roll and find and scan in down first which can take some time and depending on who you are roll thee connecting holes.
---
So it's not completely afk.
---
&gt; I already out sourced my mine to lowsec 
---
This is exactly my point. We all want more people, in nullsec, in space, in spaceships, doing things. Because if they're in space doing things, then they can die and generate content.
---
You decided the reward wasn't worth it, and left.
---
If local remains the way it is, lots of other people are going to come to the same conclusion and leave null as well.
---
I personally don't think 'adapt,' meaning 'leave nullsec because it's not worth it any more,' is a good thing.
---
People like you living in nullsec was due to errors on ccps part. The risk/ reward balance for nullsec / highsec is so badly skewed that people who would normally never have left highsec have now been living in nullsec for years and  (rightly) feel as if the rug has been pulled from under their feet when the balance gets tipped to make it a bit more dangerous.
---
&gt;And besides, we would have the same complaints about the umbrella without supers, subcap fleets can still be bridged and people would still meet a blob they cant fight.
---
You can fight subcaps outnumbered with booshers, ewar, bombs, kiting, counter comps, bubbles to split them, more effective logi or just plain flying better than them. You can't fight supers outnumbered, period.
---
There will always be people complaining about something, but bridging subcaps in is objectively better gameplay for everyone involved.
---
Incursions were still pretty populated years ago and a ton of people had these 3-4bil fits. Most Incursion groups adopted an SRP system so losing then wasn't much of an issue either. Over the years they actually became cheaper (just look at pirate BS hulls) and many groups accepted stuff like meta fit hyperions. Still nowadays theres a lot less pilots and FC's likewise. I do agree that incursions were fucking toxic, hell some people considered the group i was in as one of the most toxic ones. But new people don't know that and it's mostly a thing of the past. Im not sure how long the agency is around as i resubbed just recently but it definetly didn't manage to save TVP, which was once the biggest HQ group and died just recently. 
---
So honestly were still looking at an activity that is in an extremely massive decline, in my opinion mainly due to the increased possibilities to safely make a lot of isk elsewhere in the past years and more aggresive recruiting into null. As the other dude in here said we might see an increase again now that local in null is gone but i believe thats gonna shift more towards invasions and abyss as the trig stuff is just more public right now.
---
Where are you roaming? Use your map to find targets I've been getting fights within 30 minutes where ever I go roaming since the blackout. Outside of like 2 roams thats been my experiance which still happened more often pre blackout.
---
I'd upvote a thousand if I could. This happened to me once or twice

Was the fort rigged?

---
Its not as simple as that. PLEX goes down which is bad for the guy buying the PLEX from CCP. Things will go up in price on the rest which means that it will be more expensive to fit your ships which in turn lowers your purchasing power. 
---
And at the end of the day, thats what counts for individuals, purchasing power. So if youre paying more for your ships but less for the PLEX, your purchasing power hasnt changed.
---
I've seen plenty of new faces taking sov and dropping forts smaller populated regions the smaller pvp groups seem to be benefiting from this well.
---
thx,is there any offensive and defence requirements for this fitting doing the serpentis anomic agent mission?
---
Isk is a tool. Why would I sit around grinding to make less of it when I can use an alt in high sec or faction warfare, make a ton of it quickly and safely, then don't have to worry about it for a week or two while I do actual fun stuff?
---
The irony of the blackout is its making some people krab even longer than they were before, and because they are turtled up defensivley that makes less targets for hunters. 
---
The "group mining/ratting while having an alt in the gate camp/response fleet" stuff is chill for a while, but then you realize you are making less, so you have to do it more if you want to by what you want (or, you just start flying cheap stuff and don't worry about it at all). Again, why do that hour after hour when a Jackdaw on a faction warfare alt can get you isk fast?
---
CCPlease buff the base speed and power grid on the ashimmu
---
I'm already in a GSF corp, fairly small and a good bunch but corp mates aren't very active at the times when I am - usually the couple of hours either side of DT (not sure which TZ this qualifies as - I'm in the EU). 
---
Are Karma active at these times?
---
I'd suggest you try everything, not just missions, and then find a corp that does the things you find interesting.
---
Don't be afraid to loose your ship and don't overinvest in anything (or do and learn from your failure, that can be fun too). Do all career agents and the sisters of eve arc. Leave Highsec if the playstyle you choose permits it because the danger is part of what makes eve interesting and any money you make in highsec you can probably make more doing the same anywhere else.  
---
Expect that you will make mistakes and loose your shit and when you do try to learn what you did wrong and improve. This is true for any playstyle, even highsec mining.
---
If you get isk-hungry and try to look up ways to make money take every ISK/hour number you see and half it and you'll probably get what you'll actually earn (until you've mastered/skilled into it).
---
Comparing rl economy with the one of a game where almost every year brings a fundamental change to how things are being built/obtained/kept. Is like analyzing economy pre and post alien contact and thinking they should work the same and it is obviously the fault of robots that the new one is different. The aliens had nothing to do with it...
---
May apply to this example but this game does not only contains relic sites, there's a clear difference between seeing combats or core on your dscan so my point still stands, your proposal is stupid af and that's not uncommon since there are a lot of them on reddit v0v
---
But he really isnt. Botters havent gone away and prices on everything except for PLEX will go up. Thats inflation, not deflation.
---
To your TLDR: you will have the same result if 10k real players quit. You can say it was the bots, but in time you will figure it out it wasn't really just them.
---
but muh ticks! they suffer, you see?
---
Cause fozziesov is so engaging!
---
I didn't decide it cause of the blackout though but the effort. If I can make x3 times the isk for drastically less effort then why super rat? Every null bloc activity for isk is pretty terrible compared to lots of other options.
---
I mean I want to say it's not but if they generate content else where I don't find anything wrong with it. Plenty of other good space that no one experiences because they are content with vni ratting or any other income source in null this hurt.
---
Do you really think you'd be that much safer without the delayed info from the map? Roaming gangs send interceptors or covops out ahead of them and a mining op is pretty hard to miss. 
---
Like personally I don't care if that info is removed from the map, I don't think it would change as much as you think.
---
And get farmed into oblivion? Why?
---
I don't think rorquals should be deleted but go back to their original role which even CCP stated it should be. I do think this hurts subs ratting but I'm not sure that's a issue if your subcap ratting there are SO many better options to make isk if that's your concern then sitting spinning in a VNI.
---
It's a good thing I've only started with Eve after dropping out of university, huh?
---
I have the same problem on my main. Anyone had their character fixed yet?
---
Of course it would be empty. Were you expecting people would continue to go out all alone ?
---
They will tend to regroup to better protect each other. It's more then understandable. 
---
Well I really think 0.0 should stay in blackout mode, it feels so much nicer and immersive.
---
You dont have to be a part of a big group to be able to survive and earn your isks in 0.0. You can do it being in a smaller alliance but you should also be aware of what the smaller alliance can do in case things go south. 
---
In the end people will adapt to the currents state of things.

He only said drones though, might actually have been Mining Drones. :P
---
I think the bo is empowering the gameplay for krabbing activity. It s more fun and somehow challenging to pve at least for the single boxer. For the afk skill farm in vni, well that s another story.
---
I don't, I logi in fleets.
---
One of my most heavily downvoted posts was when 1 day after launch of no local and post drifter. I said i don't get the changes. We wanted small scale more often engagements and the recent changes have only really reinforced the mega alliance, super heavy doctrine.
---
Lol ye. The hypocrisy has been uber strong.
---
WTB co-op cyno!
---
:D
---
&gt;People used to have sympathy for you but you proved that without constraints you will fk this game into oblivion.
---
So bombing excavators is fucking this game into oblivion but the rorqual being a nearly unstoppable juggernaut of industry for years isn't? You seem to have this conception that the PvPers are just coming up with these unfun devious new strategies solely to screw over the lives of the crabs and pad killboards. It is far more complex than that. EvE has its own ecosystem, hunters and hunted, both interact with one another and in turn look to develop strategies to counter one another. The strategies that these groups develop are less based around the urge to killboard pad but instead seek the most viable tactics available. 
---
&gt;For instance what happens when rorquals are given an invulnerability field, massive tank, and the ability to call in a massive super fleet on a moments notice?
---
If you are a crab you start using rorquals, after all it is obviously the most viable option.
---
If you are a hunter though now you have a problem it is incredibly difficult to actually kill the rorquals that everyone is now using so you have to find another way to play aroudn them. And so you end up with excavator bombing. 
---
&gt;What if the hunted players start putting titans on gates ready to boson any ship passing through the system? 
---
Well the hunters are either going to fly fast inexpensive stuff to avoid camps (interceptor gangs) or they are going to bypass the camped systems with blops bridges or wormholes.
---
&gt;What if the hunted players start running massive intel channels and use easy local intel to make it near impossible to get into enemy space without being noticed almost immediately
---
Well then the hunters will start running tons of afk cloaky alts and camp all the systems they want to hunt in constantly.
---
Notice how imbalanced game mechanics on one side lead to creative if perhaps less than fun responses?  You can't hit the rorq? hit the drones. You can't sneak in and make a catch? just move in and never leave. You always are met with overwhelming force? Fly ships that can avoid the majority of hostile forces.
---
Believe me most small gang pvpers would prefer to get fights against response fleets and hunt ships and not drones. Unfortunately however, the current balance state of EvE makes that nearly impossible to do regularly.  Let me clarify again the "**current state of balance**" is the culprit not the individuals so maybe don't call people "utter douches" and "risk averse killboardpadders" their only crime is that they are adapting. It is what all the "successful" alliances have been telling them to do after all.
---
The reward that you get from killing drifters with citadel is not even that good and really inconsistent. If you look at MER you can see the reason why nullsec needs a good old rework.
---
I cant say for sure.
---
Tho when you got enough network and list of people to batphone for defense, you can start gathering people to harvesting gasses together. Or live nomadic with huge number of alpha alts logging off in Miasmo for storage, if the goal just for harvesting gasses.
---
I have stumbled on some C2 with nullsec/C6, and a corp live in it. They goes for gas with C6 stattic, PVP with NS static, and jump freighter for the hauling. since only 25-ish WH like that, Im sure it quite rare and many people wanna take it from them. Maybe the same applied for the C4 with C2/C5 static.
---
Yep, you are absolutely correct.
---
Only reason a ship doesn't stay in place is because eventually someone will move it. That's POSes kept them safe.
---
Maybe you can report this to CCP so they can remove it with GM haxx?
---
I'm a newbie player, looking to start playing EVE online via steam. Got two (three) questions: 
---
* I've heard there's some invite mechanism that gives free payed months to the inviter, if I turn to a payed subscriber. I also get some goodies from it? Where can I ask for one, and how can I ensure my sub goes to someone taking care of us noobies?
---
* How does the invite mechanism etc work with Steam? Also, are there other methods of getting free starting goodies than the referral?
---
* Steam is my go-to launcher. Any drawbacks of using it?
---
Also, the discord link has expired.
---
Subcap ratting is like nullsec minimum wage. You could lose everything you have, but still be able to grab a myrmidon and go ratting.
---
If that goes away, or becomes not-viable, it's pulling one of the pillars of living in nullsec down. Regardless of how shitty the income is.
---
The problem is that it is still not fixed as it broken as hell mechanic abuse.
---
I appreciate the comparison you're making but where it breaks down is the ratio of money supply to money creation/burning. In a real world economy you can control inflation by printing more/less money, and by taking money out of the system. CCP do not have this ability since most of the creation comes from bounty prizes (meaning its just a function of how much people rat) and most of the destruction happens from people going afk indefinitely with ISK in their wallet.
---
If the GMs were just as helpful with giving you back 3.8 bil and 1000 Plex that you lost to a hacker...that woukd be nice...i got shit nothing....
---
Yep i totally agree with you and said that in my first comment. Why would anyone outside of a Block run around in nullsec to make money? Also when drifters start again then subcaps will get killed like flies again. I would rather live in a wormhole then in a small nullsec corp/alliance. At least there I would be safer with better income.

Very

Nope u are wrong. With mutoplasmids u will hit max price right away for DED modules.

The reason why we dont feel any sympathy for null bois is because WH life has often being "collateral" damage when doing changes to the game making null life better. Nerfed capital escalations, FAX's... and the list goes on. Its quite refreshing to get fucked every now and then to rethink the way you play.
---
Get all your friends and allies to roam in delve, problem solved.
---
You cant say such a thing. Its being reported that HS have been getting a massive influx of newborn gila pilots. Botting as a whole probably never changed, they just got displaced.
---
Ye someone said something. How do I know that someone isnt you or any other pro no local? Come on man, I look at numbers and facts, I dont place much emphasis on anecdots.
---
And besides, no one is arguing against that people are having more fun. If you were to remove drug laws all together I promise you that alot of people will have fun. But that doesnt mean that it will be good long term.
---
alphas can't use ishtars tho so it's pretty ok
---
I could agree subcap ratting should be buffed in some way income wise specially with the changes but I don't know how it should be done.
---
likewise, i fit heavy neuts and cynos on my ratting dominixes
---
As a space poor living in null, this is accurate. Mostly still in null because I like the fleet fights and my coalition buddies. The area of space I'm in is full of red content seekers but they're being fairly careful to confine the conflict to a few systems rather than trying to destroy the coalition by starving it. I suspect we're the only content they've got that doesn't go straight into capital fights since it's mostly a lot of 15-50 group fighting and 1-2h skirmishes over nodes and hubs.
---
The VNI nerf was understandable but if blackout persists too long I'm simply going to end up moving my mission alt back to hisec and drop a couple of support accounts I use for PI/skill farming for my main/industry/general support in null - just won't need them. I can make almost as much ISK doing casual one character work in hisec and just get my PvP shit JF'd out from Jita when I need supplies, since local nullsec industry is starting to falter with the increased risk making anything less than a JF transport sketchy at best with all the cloakies thirsty for free kills.

Pretty witty posts for a krab, ty for sharing. I also dont think it s worth the risk and effort. But people have been running them en mass which likely deflated the loot value.
---
Well, no offense but thats just a shitty argument for having something in place. And I was against many of the old changes as well and Im sitting here saying this one isnt better.
---
Im in NS because I like the package deal, not because I like killing excavators or being uber safe. It just suits my needs of what I want to get out of the game.
---
Blap?
---
There you go, fly safe:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C2aEe14ZFSf1WAoF6n7gnd8dMbjqGeSnou8Yuug8qEM/pubhtml#
---
Just get basic skills and fly ewar in fleets. Mauluses and Crucifiers are free. Only time I've ever seen one being asked to leave a fleet was to join another fleet going out at the same time.
---
If you feel like upgrading later on you can invest in a logi ship and you'll make money each time you loose it. That's what I did, can't be arsed to grind ISK.
---
Thats utter bullshit. Stop spinning such a bad narrative or atleast stop believing in your lies. Plenty of people were getting killed in NS before this. In fact, from what I understand the kills are even less now than before so its not a good argument. Like at all.
---
bruh i find people in random ass null systems all the time, what a shitty goon psyop
---
I dunno. I like Rorquals where they are, from a hunter's perspective. Could probably nerf panic a little more, but that's going to hurt everyone but us more.
---
The thing with Rorquals is that everyone loves killing them. And they're a big enough pain to kill that it's actually satisfying when you do manage it. In some ways, killing a Rorqual is more satisfying than killing a super, because killing a super is easy after it's tackled.
---
Barges need buffed though, for sure. Or change how mining works that gives them some advantage inherently.
---
Content till 2028? I'll take it tho :)
---
Don't rely too heavy on tank, unless you're talking about rats owning you. If people find you in losec then you're dead no matter how much tank you got. EVE is a numbers game.
---
dae remember split weapon quad bonus naglfar
---
Ahh i got ya
---
Take my words with a grain of salt. I know there are real PvPers out there that will mainly if not always just go for real fights. A lot of that currently is prob gangs vs gangs atm which could have been done before this as well.
---
My point rather is that excav kills wouldnt be this high if people in general wanted gfs and not just ganks.
---
can't complain, 3 years guarantee content, yay \o/
---
(‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû
---
Yeah... Try to hunt something when it docks when you are 4 jumps away...
---
In long term? As people works togheter it gets better and it Will go Even further un long term.
---
You have places to do something more casual. HiSec.
---
The only thing that the blackout nerfed is the AFK/autistic gameplay. Nothing more.
---
I have already recreated it in stellaris      blue donut happend
---
blackout with its issues is better than local existing without a doubt
---
the meta before was fundamentally flawed, it already pushed people into supercaps &gt; all unless you were a mass multiboxer or botter.
---
Joining Karmafleet is like an expansion to the game for the price of 3 fleets/3 months.
---
The kills are less now because there are less people in nullsec because they all went to highsec to farm.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúa bad narrative‚Äù. Local fucked up got damn everything, I‚Äôd enter a system from a fresh wormhole, warp right to a ratter and watch him fly instantly away because of local.
---
Black ops didn‚Äôt work, at all, because people would see you enter local and dock up. Bubble/gate camps wouldn‚Äôt work because you‚Äôd be seen in local and they‚Äôd avoid, etc.

Eat a dick carebear

[This is the old nemesis](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/graphics/ids/2048/1909_2009.jpg)
---
My summary is  : The game has become incredibly dull for me right now.   
---
Mining wise we have made a plan to have alts on all gates and we roll wormholes so we can continue krabbing along but we lost half of our corps peoples interes to login so woohoo 2-3 of us left continuing is not as much fun as the 15-20 we were before.  
---
Big fleet roaming has not changed these fights are organized and usually dull as hell. 10% tidi and bashing static objects in space so we can come bash them later on is not really fun at all.
---
Small fleet roaming has been fun. But again first weekend was busy than it started dying down to a point where we roam for 2hours to get 1-2 kills unless we run onto another fleet and usually fleets are kiety  so they run away.
---
Solo roaming is dead dead dead. I roamed for hours on end and every now and than you see an odd nullified ceptor or a fast frigate that you cant catch or you see fleets that you cant engage with. There are also POS setups with towers and some indy ships parked up there. Boring boring boring.  
---
So to sum it up again a lot of people are not logging on anymore and therefor the game has become dull for me. All the big talk PVPers seems to have quieten down after they lost most of their ships. I cant say i am surprised. Now with the VNI nerf even more people will abandon ship as they enjoyed mindless killing of NPCs but at least they were online and on mumble.
---
I feel they should be adding this in with hacking (if they haven't already, haven't played for a while now)
---
&gt;If anything there needs to be MORE reasons to come to null. All those thousands of people who live in highsec need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into lowsec/nullsec/wormholes where they can actually contribute something to the game that isn't just mindlessly grinding missions or incursions.
---
so they can mindlessly grind anoms
---
let's be real, local needs to go, it fundamentally breaks the game
---
That would probably be CODE, aka a space-mining-protection-racket.
---
Fitting warp core stabilisers may help.
---
In what game ever could a small group of people contest a huge amount of people and have a meaningful long term effect on them.  
---
You can take out small groups and harass the everliving shit out of someone but past that what do people expect?
---
Not really, a lot of real players buy PLEX for RL money and sell it to the market and thus create supply, that drives prices down. Only players/bots that ONLY generate ISK and ONLY buy PLEX from market cause prices to go up. Difference between bot and PVE guy who grinds for PLEX is that bot can go 23/7 and generate MUCH more ISK, than he actually needs for that PLEX to Omega the account (if he is even OMEGA, he can be and probably was an Alpha). They probably use the ISK to buy PLEX in larger quantity to sell it to players on RMT and get real money out of the game.
---
All of these things are being used against supers on a daily basis. Can you win  a prolonged fights against a blob of supers? No, you cant kill them fast enough. So what, nobody is forcing you to fight them. Subcap defense fleets will shred most subcap attacker fleets, hands down. Because they can keep getting reinforced and adapting to the comps. Plus SRP.
---
No it wouldnt. Your view of objective is subjective. That would force NS to both be defensive and offensive whilst the other side only needs to think about offense. That would be tons more work for people living there which in the end would result in the game becoming even more stagnant. 
---
What you need to understand is that alot, if not most in NS, simply dont find roamers to be all that fun. They often run at the first sight of trouble and its really not that fun to chase them. Its simply not engaging and content, which is why caps are dropped.
---
that would of course change when all income sources would be balanced from a risk/reward perspective. Sure fw plex farming is the better option now but so is PI or incursion running if you can stand the mind crushing boredom.
---
My point still stands. If you don't have the time for it, don't try to play it. Simple as that. Eve is already filled with old farts their kids screaming in the background of comms. If you can't find more than an hour of gametime in a day, then single-player or casual multi-player games, where you can get in and out whenever you want, are this way ----&gt;
---
They will only get more expensive.     
---
Moon mining just got waaaay more dangerous.      
---
Fuck miners in eve &lt;3
---
F1 is always mwd. Speed is life.
---
Man that's totally not worth it. You can get triple that doing FW missions with almost no risk.
---
Have you played with those? They mostly just brick modules, and to get faction-level stuff from t2 you need to use unstables, which cost quite a bit and can still waste your money. If anything, mutas increase faction/officer mod price and demand.
---
A lot safer. That is to say, not safe. But at least you'd have to be scouted before a fleet sets their eyes on you.
---
As it is now you check the map and see that someone is active there, lets roam over there.
---
yeah game is pretty 10/10 now
---
As I said in another post I'm largely in favour of it personally. I like some aspects of it. But I have big concerns about the whole covert ops ganking thing and the viability of subcaps in null for income. Especially cases like - the newbies who keep losing all their salvage destroyers to invisible gankers, or the more casual player who rats just enough to fund some PVP ships. Someone who was running 10 VNI's before can probably just adapt and do something else, but there are a lot of legitimate players being left out to dry.
---
The excavator thing is a problem too, but that will largely be resolved by the market finding a new equilibrium. Once that happens, depending where everything lands, CCP could look at rebalancing excavators (drop rate, speed, durability, mining yield) with a new perspective while taking the local changes into account.
---
I mean I've had more gang vs gang, I've also seen more big dudes baiting with a fleet to fight with(how I lost my marshal ^^).
---
There are plenty of reasons why it didn't happen before. I don't know if I would conflate exav kills being high to people not wanting gfs people will still take free kills where they can get them. It's like saying before blackout people don't really want to fight they kill mainly vni's when thats the most you could get a lot of times before the hammer of supercaps come that you just literally can't fight.
---
Abyssals copletely safe? Not with my ISP, that is for sure, lol.
---
Consolidation my man
---
Is there somewhere an info how black market and RMT reacts to botting? I would say a lot of alpha bots buy PLEX at larger quantities to sell it as RMT for real money. And large demand for PLEX in this way drives prices up. what about prices of PLEX on RMT sites, anyone see changes since blackout? Just curious and I dont visit them so I cant say.
---
I mean. It glows yellow when it's ready to pop. At that point it'll 100% detonate within the next 3 hours max. Other than that, the moon field will be about 140-180k off the Athanor. So if you can use your tactical overlay to judge about 150km ish from the Athanor and eyeball it from there, you can get a rough idea.
---
It brought a bunch of PvP focused players back (including myself), but it is clear that no local in nullsec is too harsh. What I'd like to see if FLEX structures that provide local chat (for everyone, not just for owners and their blues). It'd make unimportant and unclaimed systems have a fog of war, while important systems would still get local, allowing everyone to use the benefits of local. However, make these FLEX structures require a lot of fuel.
---
I agree. I always hated local and the overbearing safety it gives.
---
And yeah anoms suck. But it's a basic level of income that is accessible to anyone. No local breaks that, because their only defense from a 10-man bomber gang is running away.
---
Arnie has spoken.
---
Something smells baity in here.
---
Ah cool, ty.
---
Good shout!
---
Capital escalations were not collateral damage but fix on abusing mechanic that by definition was to discourage people using capitals for PVE in WH space.          
---
Idea behind those extra spawns was to block people from using capitals, not use them to get those spawns.              
---
We will wait now years before CCP decide to fix the drifter bosses and farming them with citadel weapons.
---
I hope he‚Äôs not more careful I had fun!
---
Magic, cheers. Seems there‚Äôs a few wee tactics I can try.
---
myrmidon better lol
---
I'd just leave the Orca skills in, never know when you might want an Orca. Once you've been playing a while you'll realize the time you spent training it was nothing.
---
A dominix correctly piloted should be able to deal with loki thanks to heavy neuts or mjd out, and if you are mining without being afk you have more than enough time to pull In excavator.
---
I think as a 10 month old player you should refocus on the basics instead of training too quickly the big ship. exploration and abyssal are two easy thing that come to my mind that are easy and give a decent income (and are more funny than ratting).
---
Explo loot could go down because its never been safer / easier
---
Great summary. Including the part where you tell him to munch on a rooster.
---
If you are in the site, they can probe you anyway. Probing wreck only would do difference for people salvaging after you leave.
---
I for example, run sites and only Loot the Faction rat Aka final boss. I can see people probing and salvaging stuff everywhere like space vultures. More than a new option for hunters, is a new one for explorers.
---
fighting back is more than an option as hunter act solo or In very small group.
---
agreed for the most part
---
The same skills for the orca as is for the porpoise which is cheaper and can get into wormholes more easily and boost for gas mining ventures.
---
lmao RMTers getting really smart now.
---
Lol, right, you have a masterplan. And you said it, counters. There is no real counter atm to excav bombing. Thats why its shitty. Would also like to point out that for one, excavs have been bombed for years. No local used to be the only real counter to them. 
---
And I was against the Rorqs far earlier than you, can pretty much promise you that, I saw what they did you see. A lot of people did. You dont even know the full consequenses of Rorqs, we do.
---
If you want a fight, go fight in places where people are like you? Idk, just maybe... But you dont want the fight, you want the KMs. Thats why its hypocrisy. You fly bombers merely pressing 2 buttons and killing a couple of excavs cause you want fights? Lol, how the fuck is a fight gonna find you if you are cloaked in a no local environment.
---
Utter douches is the correct term. When one group of people keep telling others to quit because of them being this or that... Thats being a douche. Straight up dude, its not even up for debate. And I dont give a shit what anyone else did, its such a cop out. If you are a cunt, then you will be treated as such, no more no less.
---
GM should have provided a pvp fit for the venture üòÅ
---
I thought I saw Chance Ravinne with a missile launcher on his spear, good shit, loved the editing
---
People need to adapt to the new situation. 
---
If they can't do pve in capitals I'd suggest teaming up with a few guys, ticks might be lower, but there might be safety in numbers.
---
Think spider tanked domis. You wont survive against a bomber fleet, but it might be enough to fend off roaming gangs and solo hunters.
---
If anything bigger comes around it might give you the time to call in the home defense fleet aswell.
---
Dude, I roam aswell. You guys dont have the solo right to do so, even if you keep believing in it yourself. And I dont get butthurt if I dont catch anything because I was never doing it to catch ratters. 
---
Lol, wow great assumption. Which is what people were doing with umbrellas, yet everyone wants to nerf them. Decide what you actually want first.
---
Sure, lets pretend its that way. But remember your own words.
---
KF vs Waffe though Waffe is mostly a retirement home and directors safe haven now with a couple confused SA member in the mix.
---
&gt; this missive deflationary pressure
---
Inflation before this has been 15% a year.  That's a ton.  If that's down to a few percent deflation, I think we'll be okay.
---
Our employee handbook is very interesting. It's like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy except instead of "Don't Panic" it says "Do Strange Things Only" right on the cover.
---
Also, someone please give u/CCP_TrashMob some flair. I can hit him with a nerf dart from where I sit.
---
I've noticed a much higher incidence of nullsec alliances roaming in lowsec since the change, which I both loath and adore, the arse clenching moment when that wormhole I couldn't be bothered to scan down disgorges a score of ships looking to hunt is both terrifying and brilliant, it's making the alliance sharper as our miners rapidly reship and we work out whether or not we can take such a fight.
---
But the sudden comms check and everyone dropping what they are doing to form up is a sight to behold, even if we then decide to only spin as Intel tells us we are shafted like a good'un if we try to undock.
---
I'm sure some players quit.  You'll have that any time you move their cheese.
---
But we got a lot of players back too, and I think we'll get more over time this way.
---
i think you are maybe forgetting the point here...
---
the profit isnt in the pure mineral cost but rather the ship production.
---
If you live in null you should find that you can probably buy minerals from your corp ar 90% or 95% JBV
---
So instead of exporting everything back to highsec to sell... you export the datasheets and sell them and use the minerals to build your ships and sell the ships
---
Yeah KF is often a flaming pile of trash but their recruitment is on fucking point. It's hilarious how many idiots and annoying people they manage to filter out.
---
I think the main idea of the capital escalation is to even out the subcap vs cap PVE profit when doing sites. Farming the drifter with citadel is a bit broken but it can only be done few times per day and its only one single 300m rat. Not really game economy breaking. In the end from what iv seen its quite rare to do so. Its also quite easy for someone to come in and throw you out of that income.
---
The act of mass botting does not directly cause PLEX prices to rise. They‚Äôre like any other good, if demand is higher than supply, the prices rise. In this case, PLEX prices have likely been skyrocketing due to skill farmers PLEXing more and more accounts, while the supply of PLEX can‚Äôt keep up
---
Lol, wtf is wrong with you. This is what we said would happen. That even tho kills will be easier content would be harder to find. Like what? That means its a net loss so you are arguing for the exact same things that we were, and you think you are hurting me?
---
It is a bad narrative because one the one hand all NS are afkers, on the other hand we are all supervigilant and fly off. Pick a fking narrative and stick to it. Are we afkers or are we vigilant? And you have conflated bots with being real players, not my problem.
---
Bullshit. people were getting killed on a daily basis. You just werent good enough. Sorry.
---
Well, when you have no content at all youre just gonna cry even more than before. So Im fairly certain that you will be the one doing the eating.
---
Newer players in null get to a 'minimum viable skills' level for living in null and are then *encouraged* to train in to doctrine ships. With 4-5 different fleet types the time required to get in to carriers is usually pushed back a good few months
---
That wouldn't have been Chance, he wasn't in on this and WiNGSPAN were on the Persian side anyway. Pretty sure that was Drake William, one of the NREM guys. The one random guy in a Cerberus in the middle of an armor brawl.
---
I personally like surprise changes. If everything is announced and planned and min maxed on Sisi it's boring zz
---
Fuck rorqual miners, all others are ok. Also as sad as it is but the place marauders are in makes them barely used anyway. My point was though that his example was bullshit as marauders are still pretty on par 1:1 with plex pricewise.
---
callout stainguy shut the fuck up for one fucking day fucking fuck

---
Steam can be a bit weird, but I think a Steam account is easier than a normal one, because you can buy steam stuff or stuff on the Eve website.
---
&gt; The kills are less now because there are less people in nullsec because they all went to highsec to farm.
---
as a direct result of the blackout. are you retarded?
---
One thing that y need to do in order to achieve mastery of Reddit discussion of this game is that you must master bait.
---
We've gone from what some classed as risk adverse Pve to risk adverse Pvp.
---
Some of the initials ganks, fights and roams over the first week were fun.  Now it's just dull.  You barely find anyone because everyone is cloaked up waiting to gank something or docked up waiting to see if the blackout will end.
---
&gt; by paying to play this game for so many years 
---
Hear hear brother. All CCP's plans and internal documents should be available to subscribers since we paid for them!
---
&gt;They often run at the first sight of trouble and its really not that fun to chase them. Its simply not engaging and content, which is why caps are dropped.
---
Once again, that's bullshit. Because even if I show up with a battleship gang that *by definition* can't run away I'll have caps dropped on it.
---
The rest I'm not going to bother with, people can make up their own mind based on what they see every day in the game.
---
Aww:(
---
Excav killing requires a particular setup, its not just convenient killing. And mainly killing VNIs wasnt a good fight either. There are plenty of places one can find fights that dont require killing PvEers. You know this yourself, not saying that ganking shouldnt be allowed, just saying that they require 2 different changes. Sure blackout is helping as you say, which I believe, but other changes might have served that need better.
---
This change became mainly a ganking one. From my perspective atleast and the data seems to point in that direction. It hurt NS PvP and NS players to serve that purpose. Thats a bigger loss than gain.
---
&gt; People need to adapt to the new situation.

The only RIGHT you have is to buy a product or not.

There is a massive increase of misuse of that word. There's no RIGHT here. The fact that you THINK that they should ask for your opinion, or even let you know in advance, is veeeery far from your rights.
---
I won't even go into 'taste' as being a factor because I'm just gonna get haters here anyway so what's the point in all of this...
---
Yay
---
1) increase the payout(25-40%), duration(25-40%), and difficulty (slightly) for anoms
---
2) limit caps to 9/10s(havens), limit supers to 10/10s(sanctums)
---
3) halve the amount of havens and sanctums, increase 8/10s and below proportionally
---
-
---
1) remove highsec burners
---
2) limit highsec to one incursion at a time
---
3) increase covert ops decloak timer to 10 seconds (?)
---
4) remove mobile depot reinforcement timer
---
5) stront citadel reinforcement timer
---
It's just not worth the effort. You're better off doing incursions or whatever. Group ratting just takes pathetically low income and splits it between multiple people.
---
Well we all know what happens to these forts. They become loot and salvage pinyatas
---
Not really. I see that very very often. 
---
Dude, loooooooooool. How often do people even roam in battleships? Loooooooooool. Gtfo with that weak argument. 
---
Ye and strangely enough, people living in NS might understand it a bit better than people who just visit there. But sure, lets all take the word of the people who just visit. You realise how stupid it sounds right?
---
If you know 100% of the time whats behind the wall everytime it gets old real quick. PVE is 100% static and is shit PVP is 100% random = good. So by looking this formula with my 2,5 brain cells: adding RNG to PvE would make it better.
---
&gt; A lot of people that complain about it really just want easy killmails handed to them.
---
i have observed that the majority of the people who are all heart-eyes over the blackout are pvpers who haven't spent any significant amount of time hunting during it yet
---
it's true that it makes hunting a bit easier, but there's so much less stuff in space that's worth killing right now that it's nearly a wash
---
these people fail to add 2 and 2 together - they think the blackout was supposed to mean all the bots would just stay in space and be completely defenseless while they low-effort roamed in a couple of combat recon ships and collected a jabillion killmails. turns out krabs saw the blackout coming too, and their response was to just dock up and afk
---
I used book marks on the chunk and come back the next day and bookmark another one.   
---
Their is especially accurate if you‚Äôve already bookmarked the exact field location. 
---
From this you‚Äôll get exactly when it should pop
---
&gt;Having no local also makes people feel like no community and this cultural effect on people is yet to fully be felt.
---
This is a very, very interesting take.
---
There is another game out there, War Thunder (WW2 game) which has an optional simulator mode where you can't see your team mates names or on the minimap, it feels EXTREMELY lonely and as if your playing against bots.
---
With blackout everyone will reduce costs... And most expensive A-types can be farmed in low sec.
---
Game is made for tight fits, mutoplasmids can reduce CPU-PG to get a proper T2 fit.

The main idea of the capital escalation was "If you bring capital to this site we will escalate it so much that you will lose all ships".           
---
Players simply found a way to overcome this especially with buffs to various mechanics over time.            
---
Now the drifter boss was meant to replace it and was meant to be the final prize ... but people are "letting it go" to kill with citadel later.
---
Totally agree controlling inflation is important both in RL and the game but controlling inflation is not deflating an economy and that is my point. Deflation is bad there are lots of posts about it but in general deflation should be avoided. That does not indicate that correcting the game economy is wrong just that it needs to be done carefully to prevent a deflationary spiral from starting.
---
They made unprotected 00 lowsec 2.0
---
Yeah I haven't had time to do any hunting myself, but our black ops group has reported pretty much the same thing. Everything is dead, no one is in space.
---
It's kind of funny that AFK camping hunters was a better counter to local than not having local at all. People were willing to risk it with an AFK red in system at least sometimes. But they're not willing to risk it when they can't see local at all.
---
CCP is conspiring to make you go outside during summer!
---
This made me realize that eve is now suffering from the same stagnation that wow has suffered from for a long time.
---
PVE can be completed at a higher level more easily the more people are on your side. That combined with the fact that the smaller side(s) are the losing sides and people want to be on the winning side leads to a lot of people switching sides to the winning/bigger side. This results in more PVE players clumped up on one side and fewer players to PVP with.
---
He's more of a hunter than a krab.

If you're too much of a pussy to fight back and all you know is to make high-pitched screams, then no one can help you friend.

&gt; I dont place much emphasis on anecdots.

---
Can't trust anecdotes or someone said theres an influx of bots in high sec. Which one is it I got confused?
---
&gt; How do I know that someone isnt you or any other pro no local? 
---
Take off the tin foil hat my man, I laid out my position on no local. I have looked at the numbers, the places i expected to die because they are full of bots, have done so. There is still plenty of content out there and I have had a blast making the most of it.
---
We are talking about a game not the running of society. People having more fun is good for the game. Also I think legalising drugs would solve a lot of problems, so its a miss on two fronts there buddy.

It really depends how interested the factions in New Eden are in dealing with the Star Wars forces. There's the Terran weapon, there are the ships from the OP, the ground forces would be basically a nightmare for most Star Wars forces, and capsuleers are basically indifferent about death so many tactics from Star Wars would be thrown out the window.
---
But if somewhere is safe because people work for make it safe, it's OK. What isnt ok it's being safe in Null as you watch Netflix, because you had a third party app that warns you about a non blue 1000 jumps away.

As people gather around umbrellas, the anom and signatures runs faster. So if you want some good DEDs you have to move further, away from the umbrella.
---
The anom rate spawn should be nerfed a little.
---
Oh youre doing that type of counterargument. The one in which the other parties argument is being used in a shitty way to explain why its a no contest.
---
Okey sure, fine go with it.
---
how's that working out for p3ak
---
With core probes? No definitely not. With wreck probes? I don't see a problem with that.
---
Not any more than combat probes do now. It's actually impossible to catch people who are paying attention inside complexes because you have to get within decloak range of a gate to take it. So you land inside the first room of the site and the guy is already warping away from the next room.
---
It can be confusing for some new players, but our patch notes are based on the current development branch that we're working in.
---
Given that the last release was the June release, we're still working in the June 2019 branch (known as FIRBOLG internally). Next release will be August 2019 (GOBLIN internally), so the patch notes will move over from being part of the June to the August release. :)
---
Rule of thumb is to look here: https://www.eveonline.com/articles/patch-notes
---
Current release patch notes are the highest on the list, and within the patch notes for that list, most recent update is at the top :)
---
Hope this helps!
---
I wouldn't call them loot pinyatas since kspace is shit and doesn't drop anything.
---
but I don't know maybe it will but it seems pretty chill atm.
---
Being honest I don't even play Eve for the Eve anymore, it's all about the good times on comms now. 
---
I don't care where you are in New Eden, or who your corp/alliance is. If you don't have support, friendship and banter you are missing out on what the game even is.
---
In many games and rl too, actually. Every group, no matter its size has vulnerabilities, such vulnerabilities are a consequence of the groups size and become worse as the group gets larger.
---
Ask anyone working in security or the army and they'll be able to confirm that the larger the force, the more coordination with more and more people bogs down on your reactiveness and dictates your every move.
---
This, naturally is something small groups in combat with larger groups will always be able to exploit. Thing with eve is: Capitals are so powerful, you only ever need a relatively small group for defense, so coordination is never really an issue. This is what allows large nullboc alliances to react to many threats with great force within just a couple of minutes.
---
Why not add it to combat probes? Adding it to core probes means there's a way to know someone is active an area without combat probes. Right now that is not possible unless you are in dscan range.
---
Hey if you're interetest in joining Wingspan please head on over to www.torpedodelivery.com/careers to find out more info! And you can always hit us up in "WiNG-DS" in game and our recruiters will be more than happy to help!
---
&gt; discourage people using capitals for PVE in WH space. 
---
Not to derail this dicussion, but that's just objectively unfair, let's discourage caps in wh pve while caps in null pve are supremely dominant.
---
Can we see this fit?
---
This was the idea behind this mechanic if you care to look waay back into eve history.
---
Provi isn't going to consolidate even if writings on the wall.
---
RIP seekers investigation. You shall be missed.
---
Thanks, that actually sounds tempting. My old corp is currently rebooting and having one acc in test and one with them sounds like a good setup to have some fun :)
---
I will make an application I think to learn more about you guys, I only remember Test from before Brave got farmed to death by PL.
---
I mean killing excavators doesn't require really a particular setup I've done it in plenty of random ships it's just easier with others. I mean not really where will I find these fights? Thera? Abyssal pvp which is a joke? lowsec where plenty of people krab including me?
---
There is no space i can go to just avoid killing tons of krabs. You mainly kill krabs to respond and get them to undock you can't station camp them or anything like the old days.
---
I mean again the only data you seemed to have pointed at is excavator loses so I don't think you can really say it's a ganking one even though ganking is a form of pvp despite it being boring to me.
---
I'm not sure it hurts nullsec pvp the only people I can find around me that I know complaining about it are turbo krabs who only exist to increase their wallet with and only "pvp" enough to get paps to not get booted.
---
I krab and hunt In nullsec, and all the people I kill In ns (especially the domi) could have fighted back and kill me quite easily.
---
In what ways would you improve Karmafleet so it was say, only a recently bagged and not very smelly bag of biodegradable trash?
---
We get requests from GM's from time to time for stuck things like this - we db hack it to death and it's typically gone after the next Downtime
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
What do you mean? A Battlecruiser that can go 2km/s and do over 1000 dps is perfectly balanced.
---
You fucking stupid twat.  They havent posted any fit they already  have..
---
&gt; We need more pve like exploration that at least gets people flying around and visiting different systems.
---
This! Especially if it's pve designed to be done with a PvP fit so that there's literally a bunch of people in PvP ships flying around running into each other and the hunters looking for fights besides.
---
Not a bad choice because you kill 2 birds with one stone, activating your weapons and setting yourself up to yell "DIE MOTHERFUCKER" in local chat at the same time. If you also bind your scram to D, your webs to I, and your neuts to M,O,T, and H respectively, you may be approaching elite status. Its all about defeating your opponent and maintaining lively banter simultaneously, with maximum efficiency.
---
There's this cool thing called /s to convey sarcasm on the internet.
---
All that happened when I was new, was that some marmite, candyinthevan, mordus, darkness basically camped everywhere I tried to go with Tech2/3 shit.
---
But but but. NS isnt safe because of a third party app, its safe because people have worked to make it safe. And besides, dotlaaaaaan. Hunters use a third party site to catch ratters which means...
---
Good DEDs comes from running anoms faster.... My man, atleast try. Please.
---
Which it has been atleast twice in the last six months. And I dont mind nerfs, in fact you will find that I havent complained about a single nerf even tho NS has been hit with multiple ones the last six months. What I do mind is when a core mechanic gets changed without any form of balance. 
---
If you live in WHs and CCP all of the sudden says, we are gonna instate local there. Wouldnt you dislike it? If you change a core mechanic that messes up the package deal people opt into. A nerf is meh, balance, quite fine.
---
Do you see the difference? One driving people away whilst the other is meh, no real change to the package.
---
Source?
---
Data sites are already really profitable and can be done by any brand new account in no time. Do we really want to buff that? I'm fine with adding items if other stuff is removed or rates are lowered.
---
Telling people the CEO of a huge Corp spends his time running a 150 man roam on the weekends with his line members is one of the coolest ways to blow their minds.
---
Saturday Night Swarm is a huge draw for me personally.
---
Stop calling them tapi. it's really weird
---
It's great, i find now lying null is very immersive, feels like space instead of a dockup simulator.
---
How is reducing the ludicrous amount of mining going on shitty?
---
This wouldn't work. Any decent group PvPers could take out a PvE group of larger (obviously up to a point) of PvEers. When you rat you adjust your fit towards the rats damage and resistance. The PvPers would just need to fit according to that and they'll have an easy kill. This is also IF the ratters fight and not just run away, abandoning the poor sucker who gets tackled.
---
I can imaginge someone countering with a Domi fit that could handle the rats without gimping themselves against other damage types but then you'd just counter the ship type.
---
What you're asking for is basically just incursions but everywhere.
---
\&gt;  For those managing to survive in a finally high-risk space...
---
For those safely hidden under a super umbrella...
---
There, FTFY, no need to thank me.
---
I just like being able to rapid response pvp against roamers. I dont need a cyno to fight 2 dudes in T3Ds or a solo Stratios.
---
Totally agree with the heavy neuts though.
---
Right, but that isn't what he is arguing however.
---
If his argument was "there are less kills now because of less people" i'd agree, however his argument was "pvp people didn't need local being removed, they just needed to be more creative" to which we all know thats not true.
---
Keep it, u will use it for sooner or later. Only way to reskill is to pay a lot and lose some moneys not worth it.
---
&gt; That even tho kills will be easier content would be harder to find.
---
I'm fine with that, obviously there needs to be some risk/reward balance passes by ccp now.
---
I think most people would be fine with some sort of income increase.
---
The balance isn't right yet, but it can be there.
---
Going back isn't the right call, they need to balance certain aspects.
---
Obviously there isn't the return there to risk rorquals/supers yet. 
---
IMHO everyone is still in the "Trump" phase of the change, where everyone just buckles down and plays team fortress and hopes everything goes back to normal. 
---
It won't.
---
&gt;Yeah,I konw that
---
It's hard to understand but they know the garmur can be used for team and want the know about fits for agents. I know team and agent are close in spelling but they're different, trust me.
---
Just finished Eco 101 and 102 and now applying everything in your intro classes to real life without understanding any of the principles you just applied?
---
Sure but these are all short term effects that do not affect blocs in any major way - aka a small group won't go into a blocs home region and claim sov with the intent of turning it into a home.
---
Like I said people in small groups will be able to harass larger groups, and that kind of game play is great. My point was that all of these posts complaining about the little guy not being able to take and hold sov - yes they can, they just cant hold it long term if someone bigger wishes to take it, and nothing CCP do will change that.
---
I had no idea. Can you shield rep any POS? Why doesn't everyone do this? Seems like a no brainer to save your stuff.
---
I was recruited to the only real alliance I've ever been in after they killed me with all of my worldly belongings on board. I have recruited other members in the exact same way. 
---
It's a game, and games should be fun. We like new players, and enjoy watching them "grow up".
---
Welcome to a truly fucked up and awesome culture.
---
&gt; You can still do 700+ dps easily ... with huge tank on gila.
---
Yeah and it used to have another lowslot so not sure what you're getting at here. 
---
&gt;If such ship decide to do bounce on some ongrid perch when you lock it
---
What even is this argument? If you can't lock a hecate before it kills you then maybe get a better fit. If it bounces then warp off??
---
Wow what a douche
---
I'll set my keaboard to pulse PINK with these keys as well. *cracks knuckles*
---
He was referencing the ring
---
Still.its going up. Most of exploration loot came from local craps who never learned how to exploration just undocked and relied on intel in their local space
---
The anom rate spawn should be lower to make people move. Not because DEDs.
---
It's not profitable or worth the trouble to buy plex from CCP and sell it or the isk from it in RMT.
---
I still have my SA account, and I'm in TEST. It's confusing posting in the eve thread.
---
Those area's loot is not getting rarer. If you actually bothered to read you would have found it.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. Honestly in my opinion caps shouldn‚Äôt be used for ratting period.
---
What its like being a little carebear bitch?
---
Love it
---
On this level it requires bombers but ye ofc not when youre just randomly doing a couple. Lowsec and WHs right? I mean I used to live in LS and I know plenty of places to get a fight.
---
Honestly, I dont really buy into that. Nobody is gonna make a massive effort to hunt down someone who just killed a VNI no matter. Maybe small groups but like any big ones?
---
I really dont need other data. Excav bombing lacks a counter and its gone up massively compared to last month. Come on man, you can read between the lines on that one.
---
NS PvP has gone down, this is coming from someone who lives in NS. And it makes sense, how much time do you think people have? Right now its a lot of defense which is stopping the offense, I mean people cant be at 2 places at the same time. If blackout becomes permanent then you will see the long term effects, it will burn people out.
---
At some point, one has to actually start to hear the other side. Im not a turbo krab, and im not an "elite", I sit in the middle and I enjoy it here. And Im complaining. Not because no local hurts me individually, in all honesty I know most of the tricks so Im rather safe. But I see what its doing to others, I see a massive offset in balance. And I know its gonna make the game worse, not for me, but the game in its entirety.
---
Now you can choose to actually hear what Im saying or we can just let it play out. In the end its CCPs call.
---
You're doing something seriously wrong if you're roaming null for 2 hours without without a fight.
---
Cats, dickbutts, spodding, and Saturday night swarm.
---
Why even mention DEDs then?
---
And like I said, it has been. And Im not against that idea. I want a complete overhaul of that system since its such an old one and rather shitty. But that has nothing to do with no local.
---
Goons were winning the game economically by farming Delve so they want the game to return to that same state.  That's why they're spouting the same negative opinion about blackout being bad for the game.
---
Yeah, setting up PvP takes more time than setting up PvE. 
---
Go and think about what you are saying for a moment.
---
Test's rorqual defence is on point tbf.
---
Oh noes you're using one of those arguments where you take something I said and prove it wrong. Shitty argument!
---
im going to green bay for a preseason game august 8th and spending 2 weeks in wisconsin, it's a p good state if you're out in the countryside
---
Your cute, can I have you? :)
---
&gt; Subcaps are completely worthless in this meta. 
---
so what?
---
ratting subcaps simply warped off and docked as soon as a hunter gets close and gets detected by near2, to say nothing of the bots that warp off as soon as a neut enters local.
---
And it really looks like an exploit
---
So you are fine with iteration. But so am I, whats the problem then? The current no local is broken, thats what the fking complaints have been about. Everything you are saying is the issue is what we were saying. Literally!
---
I just dont get why you are arguing against someone using the same arguments that they are using. You like to argue with people or what?
---
Introducing no local in its current form was stupid, end of story. This is your opinion as well.
---
Imperium are all bots, Dead co are all bots, Horde are all bots, BoT are all bots, Frat are all bots. Bots everywhere, all of them! Except maybe Test, I don't hear them getting accused of botting all the time.
---
Nope you aren't the only fool.
---
He hasnt proven me wrong. Hes just made me tired. He hasnt listened to what I said and I really dont wanna go through the motion of explaining everything. Its just a shitty form of discussion which never fking ends. Its not new and anyone whos ever done any form of debate will know it.
---
Solo roaming is not dead by a long way. If you roam for hours with nothing then you're doing something very wrong.
---
Aggroed asteroids? ... What are they going to do, hit you?
---
... Then again, that *could* be pretty terrifying.
---
If u want less mining, then you just fking remove excavators. You dont start a Excavgeddon. I get, Im a moron for actually wanting to fix the ailment.
---
So you didn't read either. I have multiple alphas and omegas, I was skilling AN Alpha for a particular purpose which would have been accomplished BEFORE the nerfs were originally supposed to hit.
---
There's always a guy on the toilet in cross section books.
---
Carriers pretty much get instagibbed by a roaming group
---
I'll buy that 3000...and congrats on one of the few intelligent comments on this thread!
---
Dammit! You make me cry for a fuckin' internet space ship... :-)
---
What makes you think any of you are worth lying to? That's the biggest ASSume I've seen here in a sea of ASSumES
---
I rant. Not whine. There's a difference.
---
Correct! Well some of you are...not you though!
---
Good attempt, talking about long term effects but implicitly you're narrowing down its meaning to the point where it fits your point of view.
---
For the sake of argument (and I'm in now way condoning acts of terrorism IRL): Did the people behind 9/11 intend to conquer new york? Probably not. Did it have a long term effect? Yes.
---
I absolutely agree with you (at least your second paragraph), but harassing people and having meaningful impact on them often has nothing to do with the desire of taking sov.
---
Caracal is a magical town in Romania.
---
Be sure to visit the \`\`wonders\`\` of Caracal.
---
Like the Prison on Freedom Street.
---
The crane between the buildings.
---
The Bakery on Hunger Street.
---
The Nr. 2 School(there is only one school).
---
The Cemetery on Resurrection Street.
---
Don\`t get sick there.
---
Keep a close eye on your wallet
---
And don\`t be civilized with anybody there
---
"CCP do not have this ability since most of the creation comes from bounty prizes"
---
I'm genuinely curious, who do you think controls the bounty prizes?
---
I can't even snark this...as for my reality...it exceeds your fantasies...
---
Fozziesov still needs some iteration still but it can actually be pretty fun when you're not part of a null bloc. I can see why sitting in a 100 man fleet semi-afk while you wait for your toasters to finish can be boring but at a small-scale it can be quite engaging when the win condition isn't "how many supers can you field".
---
Well done, beyond the better bond with your corp mates, I hope you earn more in the long run.   With higher risk you deserve to be compensated more for PVE (and to pay for your security force too).  I hope more goons start to see this way o7
---
So you're saying cynos are broken. Hard agree.
---
What the fuck, my BO isn't that bad, I took a shower last month.
---
Because super-ratting in Umbrella space is safer than flying blinged battleships in Hisec, clear design error
---
Removing excavators and starting excavgeddon is the same thing.
---
The good ones, maybe. Most bots AFKing anoms in VNIs are not good ones. There's almost no logic they would need.
---
Oh okay so you can use anecdotes to support your argument but they can't. Gotcha.
---
i used to rat in provi eons ago. had twice a guy get in tengu on my grid, only to watch me warp away. ofcourse he cried in local about bots. was i supposed to let him kill me or what :P
---
Hmm now that's interesting...my "mad" and my "pissed off" are actually two separate and distinct states of mind. This was pissed off.
---
You have served me well by allowing me to realize that...
---
I made a plan based on the best information I had at the time. Turns out that information was incorrect due to the "ball" being moved. Not thrilled about..oh hell I've already said I pissed off about the ball being moved, but no great loss. Thing is though I tend to speak my mind giving no shits about how anybody reacts to it. Well unless the other party has guns and badges.
---
Nope. Came here to speak my piece, because I felt like it...Actually I had no idea that you lot would choose to entertain and amuse me. And probably will continue doing so today!
---
If you read from the start you will see that without adjustments to "roaming" ships people will be pushed to capitals as only viable ratting method ^(i know that CCP is working on capital changes).          
---
The problem is that current 'roaming' ships have so much firepower that ratting ship melt to small gang without any real chance for reaction. ^(thus push to capitals).
---
And?
---
But why does it have a ring when you can't install a cloack
---
Only CCP.
---
TEST is so bad even the bots aren't interested.
---
You are also missing a significant point here.       
---
People didn't bot to buy plex but to RMT it.         
---
Thus even more increasing the demand on the plex price.
---
Neither of noticed: Alpha(multiple) AND Omega. Read more CLOSELY. That way you won't say stupid shit!...Well actually MAYBE you won't say stupid shit. No guarantees...Actually now that I think of it, you probably will continue to say stupid shit. Carry on.
---
Do you even basic economics?
---
Amount of currency goes down, prices on everything purchased with said currency goes down :logic:
---
I remember 350mil GTC ....       
---
GTC was 60 day of game play.
---
I think after the initial hype, it will be a poor long term decision.
---
I have little reason to be out and unlocked in space in null, unless it's in a cap and/or blob
---
" Also, sincerely doubt you're qualified to dispense business advice."
---
" My bank, stock, credit union and other counts say that you to chose to ASSume! "
---
Comprende' Senor?
---
Thats more content ;) isnt that all that we want :p
---
‚ÄúBetter hunting‚Äù my ass, all the high value targets aren‚Äòt undocking and not everyone likes kicking retarded goons or cheap shit anom ratters
---
tiz dank :)
---
I told you so.
---
&gt; deflationary spiral
---
The deflation, if there even is any, won't be significant enough to act on.  Are you really going to hold isk because it might be worth 4% more next year?  No.  You'll still blow that away by actually playing the market and selling things.  The inflation is just not going to be 15% inflation per year anymore, and that's just fine.
---
Did no one tell you when you moved to null.       
---
**Don't be a miner**         
---
I had the luck of meeting the actual old guard.       
---
Some of them even respected the ransoms as it was right thing to do.
---
Nex time warp a dread and siege and watch as you reach planet X.
---
Lol what? No dude, I dont basic economics since Im actually trained and work in the field. And by no means is anything about economy that basic and if Im understanding what you are saying its a really really dumb assumption. 
---
You are being sarcastic right? Have to be, nobody can be this stupid.
---
Abyssal income will dropoff with time, especially as the raw "bounty" income is not all that much. Just like how sleeper salvage slowly decreased with time (melted nanoribbons anyone?) the same will happen with abyssals. Just slowly.
---
I'd expect abyssals to be quite good for the economy in general since any losses are 100% lost from the game, and the isk *source* (survey data) of the site is significantly lower in comparison
---
Preach it oodell!
---
You mean playing the game of which goon isnt on coms abd in fleet
---
Curse has great range for blops - try qfew and those areas.
---
Sure, lets put it like that.
---
No its not.
---
Tbh i like the idea people living in small areas that they defend.      
---
Like the idea that all sov space need to be claimed is pretty dumb for me.         
---
Even more, increasing how many people can live in a system, with escalating the cost of maintaining big space could be a very interesting move **if we get incentive from CCP to fight among each other**.
---
Most of null was dead before, the christmas tree of npc kills was just an illusion. Drone regions were mostly dead after XIX eviction, apart from some botting operations in fringe constellations.
---
Have you read "The Futurological Congress"? Or seen Matrix movies that were inspired by it? So, welcome to the real world.
---
It's painful, yes, but i don't think that returning to the illusion is the right choice. Maybe there will be some new blood in null with time, since there are so much empty space right now for grabs (unless big blocs will go full dog in the manger)
---
This blackout is great. There's lots of nerds to kill if you just go out of your own space looking for somebody to kill. My isk making has not been affected at all as I don't make my isk in anoms
---
&gt; Equities are considered the riskiest play (not including crypto which isn't trading, it's gambling, come at me bruh). But they also carry the largest potential reward 
---
**WRONG.** Playing the weekly naked option on triple leveraged VIX etfs is a little more risky.
---
Can confirm, I stopped roaming entirely this week.
---
This fucking heat man, I can't even put on my headset...
---
Can't wait for it to cool down so I can farm nullbears again though.
---
CCP kill your mod?
---
Sure, 200m/h people will be fine with 500m per pop pvp. The percentage of eve players with that high efficiency is roughly the percentage of players that would participate in that kind of pvp, which is exactly quite low as it shows.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the feeling I‚Äôm getting too. People seemed to be just waiting it out. But now that‚Äôs it seems more permanent they are only undocking if they have super protection
---
what, I was buying 90 day GTCs.
---
well ok, I bought 1.
---
^ this 
---
When blackout hit I hoped this might be the outcome..... it has not been
---
Just like any other starting NPC corporations , except members live in nullsec.
---
Look I kind of agree about power creep. The problem is you're all over the place with your arguments.
---
Why would they buy plex instead of trading the isk directly?
---
I wish I could say the same...
---
Funny thing is if\* they try to roll back changes only bots will come back xD
---
&gt; I'd expect abyssals to be quite good for the economy in general since any losses are 100% lost from the game, and the isk source (survey data) of the site is significantly lower in comparison
---
If the risk-adjusted income from abyssals becomes too low they won't be run, so isk lost from the game through this channel will become zero - the only people left running will be min-maxed ships that haven't lost one in forever.
---
All my VNI designs for all of both Alphas and Omegas still perfectly work fine for what I use them for.
---
The best part of the change is that there are so many VNIs on sale in null.
---
Completely removed the sense of sharing space with other people for me. Eve is just discord now.
---
Just saw your edit. Dude, inflation/deflation has to do with prices. Now central banks adjust inflation/deflation by the amount of currency available yes. But it has to do with prices, if everything gets more expensive then we are talking about inflation, no matter the amount of currency in play. Those things have more to do with scarcity.
---
What MER? The new one isnt even out. And still, its not deflation. The economy might shrink but that doesnt mean the prices are going down. That is more ruled by supply-demand than the amount of isk in the game.
---
&gt; abyssals, incursions, missions wormholes
---
And none of them in null, which is not in conflict with op's observation that null is dead. People now go to high sec incursions, missions, or instanced abyssal for isk. Fewer people to gank in nullsec. Exactly what op said.
---
Yeah, because otherwise you are just feeding free kills. What's the point of that?
---
Planning based on the best information at hand at the time the plan is derived and executed, including plans based the "habits" of the "opponent" isn't an assumption per se.
---
Planning in all things not based on physical laws is always imperfect.
---
Idk who you're talking to, whenever i lived in null i was there to fight. I just don't have a problem with miners that don't/didn't abuse excavator cancer. (Except Bovril, these guys suck no matter what they do)
---
You loot only main cache? or all with tractor?
---
I'm kind if a noob but this is all I hear.
---
We cant find anything to kill so people should adjust their play so we have fights. (Fights we win).
---
Essentially the same as this argument.
---
When I'm out in my Atron I never see any t1 solo frigs to fight...or when I do they have max skills and implants!
---
I'd put my main character back there.
---
Only main. I suppose i could do all with tractor. Not sure what the added profit would be. As you also fill up quicker and probably spend more time in each room. But could give it a try
---
I'd love to know where this is, maybe we can run into each other. I've been scouring anywhere I can find a wormhole too that is not delve malpais etc and I've not had any kind of luck this week.
---
what is your twitch accaunt?=)
---
&gt; Was this CCPs short sighted intention all along? 
---
No, the entire intention, as stated multiple times, is to see what affect the blackout has.
---
My experience has been similar. During the first week there was a ton of content. The second week, quite a bit less, mostly people in cloaky T3Cs who only uncloak when they see a fight they can and will win. This week it seems that no one is on at all. Standing fleets have dropped from 30-50 people to 10-15 people. I can't say that it's because of the blackout though, it is summer, maybe people are busy, etc.
---
Hmm 90?     
---
It was quite a while ago, like quite a whiiiiiiiiiiiiiile.
---
&gt;Introducing no local in its current form was stupid, end of story. This is your opinion as well.
---
This isn't my argument at all, im fine with it.
---
it clearly needs to have some tweaking, frankly I think it will come down to mineral consumption making rorquals viable again through mineral prices spiking.
---
As it has been said - find a corporation (no problems if you hop them a lot at start until you find the right one)  
---
Make sure they're nice people, play on your timezone and they got something to do.
---
So you make supercarrier level isk, but you're just risking 3.5b. Not too shabby, although supercarrier level isk is really quite bad tbf
---
The new VNI is retardedly strong. It literally has the tank of a Brutix on a cruiser hull, insane tracking that can hit frigs well, bonused drones and enough fitting to have everything you want.
---
I am toying with a triple rep fit and it literally tanks 1,300dps overheated.
---
It got me back in the game just when I was about take a break. Love it.
---
I started this game about 5 days ago and this happened to me as well.  Great community involvement.
---
Actually, I think there were both 60 day and 90 day ones.
---
I am thinking goons able to live in 2-3 constellations or even less.        
---
So much bigger density - but only if we get not a smaller incentive to raid other areas.
---
RABIS fc here. (also nag without stront , hello im elite)  our corp spotted the fort timer and parked eyes all around the area , saw your rattlers and decided to go and try fight your bois . sadly we had no caps prepared really since we returned to lolsec so we just grabbed whatever we could find in our hangars and went in. pleasantly surprised when you immediatly dropped dreads on us :DDD but since we were not prepped at all we ate shit from all gangs on grid in the opening , cynoed whatever dreads we could get out of siege out of fight after all our subs got booshed off . spent a very long minute regrouping and discussing weather to go back in , decision was made to go back in with whatever survived the initial encounter and try brawl everyone on grid down.  
---
i cant wait for the next time we fight ;) and maaaaaybe ill have stront that time xD
---
GFGF
---
That‚Äôs where running Frigate sites solo come into play. Way lower risk and can easily match cruiser T4s when running solo T2s. Tbh I seem to get way higher numbers per hour than what most cruiser runners get and I pay penny‚Äôs for the filaments.
---
and also depends on who owns/fuels the citadel in which you're reacting.
---
Barely passing econ 101 does not an expert make.
---
Tbh i am not sure if the PLEX that was on the market when i started to play the game was player seeded or still CCP seeded.       
---
Way to  many years ago.
---
Aside from the fact that i disagree with the multiboxing part (greetings from DIN) 
---
- this is exactly my point. The income from incursions, especially these days, isn't high if you compare it to possibilities of other areas of space. Judging by posts i read about filament running that isn't quite as profitable as it's made out to be here either.  
---
And both of these activities have something that justifies an at least somewhat ok income. For Incursions you need a coordinated fleet, for high tier filaments average fits are very expensive and can easily die if either you get unlucky with spawns or if someone ganks you when you come out (so the risk vs reward factor is there).  
---
So i disagree with the OP, highsec income isn't too high (and memes aside it's a valid space to live in, just like every other space, so i don't see why leaving it should be encouraged more than necessary)
---
I am not on reddit to read. I am here to shitpost and play smartass.
---
Ratters already skip looting, so giving all the payout to bounties would be better for them.
---
Cause it‚Äôs a mission :) I am willing to bet I can still make more running in my Frigate as I don‚Äôt need to fly anywhere / stop / dock nothing. I can rage run for hours if needed.
---
Be ready to LEARN.
---
Eve is a complex game a expansive environment where you can do whatever you want with your spaceships.
---
I highly recommend it. Hell, you can try it entirely for free.
---
&gt;larger groups not being affected as much as small.
---
This is, and will always be, true for nearly all changes
---
That is correct. However i suppose a cruiser is more easely lost than a supercarrier. I think its a fair comparison though.
---
&gt;less bots.  
---
They will adjust their scripts to a point where they will be harder to catch than before.
---
Just spoke with a corpie about this last night, our corp is pvp focused but everyone mines to pay for pvp. We are part of a medium sized coalition and do have a cap umbrella of sorts but it isnt utilized as much as others.
---
The blackout at the beginning was great lots of kills to be had but the shine is wearing off, hunting is tougher, big targets are staying docked up(including our own) and its getting boring.
---
Last night we talked this though extensively and it was both our opinions that joining one of the big coalitions was going to be the only way we will be able to begin mining/ratting again without a high risk of losing what we trained and worked so hard to learn to fly and the isk to fit. 
---
As the blackout continues I think we will see maybe 4 major blocs rise in Null and all the small alliances and corps will need to join a major bloc to have some protection to do what they do. I think its universally agreed that this is not a good direction for eve but its the only thing that makes sense to me as a player if you want to mine or rat in an expensive ship and ensures you will have a support fleet when you do inevitably get dropped.
---
&gt; I'm genuinely curious, who do you think controls how much the bounties are worth?
---
That isn't the same thing nor is it the only thing. An rl government can specify an exact monthly figure down to the cent that they want to put into their money supply. CCP can fiddle with the bounty figures but that's going to have secondary and tertiary effects elsewhere in the economy, and also assumes peoples behaviour won't change based on those bounty prizes (which they absolutely will).
---
You're kinda missing the point though which is that it is mechanically impossible for CCP to create net zero inflation, something which would be absolutely trivial (though almost certainly undesirable) for a real central bank.
---
This is essentially: fuck anything that isn't exactly identical to how I play.
---
Until CCP incentivizes LOSING your ship. People are going to continue to avoid unfavorable match ups.
---
I used to super rat in a big null bloc. It's hilarious how safe it is. The only true vulnerable window is the moment you just landed in anom. After that you can insta warp out or insta jump out at any moment. The highest efficiency ratting activity also has the lowest risk. How is this reasonable game design?
---
Woohoo! :D
---
ssssssssalty. Just derped around provi and got a million fights

Goonthink is a special thing. They take your brain out, and it's the orange sauce they put in to replace it.

---
HYSJ
---
That's not deflation. If resources get MORE difficult to get, therefore lowering the supply, the price INCREASES. Deflation causes the price to decrease, because your money is more valuable. Giving everyone an incentive not to spend it because their money will be more valuable tomorrow than it is today.
---
Not even sure hes grr nullsec, and if he is he'd be even more if he knew how severely hes underestimating the isk you can make there.
---
* 5 minute cooldown on fighter MWD
---
* Triple the sig radius and add a tracking penalty to all capitals
---
Eve is hard for everyone even guys who have been playing for ever, part of its charm. If you decide to jump in start a free character do the starter missions find yourself sitting space being confused (normal for Eve never goes that). If you like it keep going I would say it gets easier but that would be a lie.
---
If they wont be run, the prices will spike again, and people will start taking the risk and running them again.
---
ISK is one of those resources.
---
you should see the nice "wormhole scrammed and webbed" action i can sometimes do
---
but there is place for 5mins pinata mode ? rofl. Without panic, small alliances wont use rorquals anymore.
---
In the description of I recall correctly it says that they tried to get it to cloak, but they went all out trying to get it to work with covert ops as well and they just simply couldn't get it to work. But it the overall design was still very strong for such a light BS that they still wanted to use it.  So the diverted the excess power to other system. That's why it has such a good cap pool.
---
SSSHHHHHHHHH!!!
---
Exactly as should be, **if** demand for the items they generate remains constant or improves. Cyclic economic behaviour like that is good for the game.
---
Reddit makes null sound boring. Bunch of huge ass alliances worried just worrying about farming ISK.
---
I   have more fun just dropping $20 on a plex and having a months worth of ships to blow up in FW.
---
Your not actually going to fly into an asteroid field!?!
---
Well EVE is installing now, I'll take a look tonight, I hope I'll love it, since I really need a new game to spend my free time on
---
It means people will switch to supers and condense into super umbrellas. That is all.
---
Why go to null when I can just farm a c5 or c6 , at least in jspace I can make good isk.
---
You want to make real isk in null, you don't waste time in anomalies focus on the market.
---
Let the peasants tend to the field.
---
pvp players know best about pvp. what they don't know about is the sustainability of living in null because the majority of them have zero experience with it
---
For the first couple of days, or maybe first week it was better. But nobody is undocking anymore
---
I'd bet this was done for server load reasons and didn't have anything to do with gameplay
---
Shhh
---
they did fine. they were blue to goons and we weren't bothering them, so, they reverted to their natural state - krab people
---
&gt; I'd like to see ns subcap PVE buffed in a way that you can put yourself at risk to make mucho cash. I have no idea what that would look like.
---
gates on anoms
---
been saying it for years
---
That's not exactly true many people loot and salvage especially with MTUs making it much easier.
---
We did used to have a little what the OP suggested but CCP nerfed them to hell.
---
NPC regions used to have more faction and Officer drops than null. 
---
We used to have only a few static 10/10 sites.  
---
CCP killed both and replaced with dead space escalations making officer loot a bit pointless but become more of a vanity item.
---
I hate dronelands because of drones so if this was all null I would stop playing.
---
Most factions do come from the NPC regions they just spread out to the surrounding  null regions which is understandable really.
---
Two factor. Enable it and use it. Use Authy. It'll never happen again.
---
They should just rename the game to "Menus."
---
Its still PVP and content. Plus I dont think that having to defend your miners with a response fleet in null-sec or other more dangerous area is a bad thing.
---
I like the VNI changes. I'll miss my cheap sentry drine sniper but the changes make the VNI an incredible brawler
---
Spot on : problem is cynos and jump drives.  
---
One or the other should have a cast / spooling time.
---
He says they have 20-30 people online...
---
&gt; it's best to do 4AU sweeps of the planets like comments above say
---
but wouldnt it make more sense in reverse?   
---
Like, concord is only concerned about keeping high/lowsec relatively rat free so they give payouts for that. However, due to security reasons the rats in hs/ls are not the powerful ones but more like vanguards, raiders, probing attacks.  
---
In lowsec the payouts would be lower (as concord doesn't care as much) but the rats can become larger/have fobs, etc.    
---
In null, concord doesn't give you shit (because they just don't care), but you get the good drops which you sell then in hs, either to players (the modules) or to npcs (special items/tags, much how like blue loot works).   
---
Sure the corps would have to adapt to this change, because the tax rate system doesn't make much sense and will have to get something going - like market tax for example or buyback programs.
---
Minmatar have ammo cargo

Multiboxing was viable when you had 3 parallel Hisec-Incursions all the time --&gt; rare contests. This is different since you only have 1 Incursion live. If someone still excels in Multiboxing over individually piloted fleets I would heavily assume stuf not conform to EULA (like input broadcasting).
---
Yes, because someone who needs community fits will know where to go to find the gas and how to mine it properly without getting killed?
---
Stop being so pedantic.  Why are all wormholers so fucking dense?
---
Eve is hard, it's complex. The amount of information can be scary at the start, but it's not complicated informations per see.
---
my basic position is that anyone who thought the local blackout would allow them to go farm infinite krabs was nearsighted to the point of stupidity, likewise for anyone who thought it would provide a long term content stimulus - the current state of things is the only way this was ever going to end up. krabs dock up and log out, and slowly there's less and less reason for anyone to even bother
---
Pushing F1 on a nyx is very different from hunting it though. Especially while it easnt ratting.
---
Yeah, in a corp. That means there is about 20-30 similar corps in their alliance and few of those alliances together usually consitute a nullsec blob.
---
Yeah and that's harder to do with no local.
---
i used to run vnis and used the tiberizzle method to deal with roamers tackling my vnis - anyone who's solo hunting one vni is seldom prepared to fight 5 of them at the same time
---
Its getting better for new players. If u have friends that play ull be ok.
---
As someone who recently started an alt character and was greeted by a GM, from my personal experience they reach out with a conversation first and attempt at a direct dialogue. Pretty unique for me personally, I got to talk one on one with a GM and even though I was not a new player I got to ask some questions I was curious about but never had an answer for and it was a refreshing experience. I also received  a very similar evemail to this once we finished talking. Just thought it was worth mentioning as you said you would generally reach out with a "personalized in-game email" and that now the evemail seems to be a follow up rather than the initial greet.
---
You are still glossing over a bunch of edge case scenarios that although we don't even think about them as people who have been scanning for a while are going to confuse the fuck out of new players. 
---
Imho the best thing to start new players with is the things that work with the fewest edge case problems and then let them find the more efficient ways of doing it on their own, they will be equipped to deal with the edge case problems then.
---
person who has no idea who i am detected
---
i'm not exactly hiding. my reddit name isn't my main's name but it's really not hard to tell which side of this debate i'm on
---
I hear no one is undocking and yet the fleets I go on are getting swarmed with activity.
---
I keep hearing this will ‚Äòonly make the big groups stronger so we need to end it‚Äô from mostly the big groups.
---
As for the bots, they have not adjusted yet.
---
I can find plenty to kill, local blackout makes escalation far easier. Also if you're a newbie the t1 frigate thing was happening before the blackout.
---
I wrote very specifically many areas where I have been visiting, and gone back several times and there's nothing but citadels on dscan. Dotlan is also empty. It's not like we are roaming around syndicate not able to find something to kill. I'm talking places I would normally go that had machs, rattles, nighmares, lone carriers and supers out ratting before. Those places everyones pussied out, these areas dont have any activity, even gate jumps have dropped off the radar this week.
---
I'm sure some people are finding content still but I dont believe anyone who says it's like week one of blackout, that's a complete lie. You cant argue dotlan stats.
---
These people are logging in and just sitting in their forts and keeps not undocking which is retarded. Warp to a fort and you see there's people docked in it.  Why do people even play this game if they are not gonna undock and do anything? Its completely pointless in my eyes
---
Remember when the elite AT pilots said it would be under-powered and not used?
---
Ahh! My bad! Edited above to reflect you're not op.
---
Godspeed. [The meme is real](https://i.imgur.com/tgQSMdW.jpg), but damn if it doesn't get your heart racing at times.
---
i've definitely killed more supers due to cloaky camping (idk at least 6-7, can't check zkill at work) than i have due to local blackout (2)
---
there are levels of uncertainty people are willing to deal with, and no local is not one of them for most krabs
---
&gt; In a real world economy you can control inflation by printing more/less money, and by taking money out of the system.
---
CCP can do that too, the mechanics are called ISK faucet &amp; ISK sink.
---
Example 1: Introducing Trade Citadels was a direct nerf to the ISK sink that is taxes and fees for trading.
---
Example 2: Implementing umbralla-enabling mechanics is a direct buff to an ISK faucet.
---
Example 1 + Example 2 = Inflation ... simple as that
---
he was travelling and we caught him with dictors cloaked on a gate, that he didn't know were there when he gated his scout through because no local
---
you're not the only person in eve who has a brain, steadyo, but you're definitely one of the most arrogant
---
Hahaha damn, that looks hard
---
&gt;Its still PVP and content.
---
So is dropping 5 carriers ok the attacking fleet, but that's the kind of content this place gets mad about.
---
I just think if you only ever attack ships that you can certainly kill and run from actual fights, it's not really PvP. Especially when these are the people who say caps are ruining the game when they do the same thing to the cloakyloki squad that they did to a lone venture.
---
The market station already get a cut, so no need to change the corp tax system.
---
Drones initially didn't have any bounty just alloys.       
---
CCP removed this as most of materials ingame came from them.
---
Meh, as i said, greetings from DIN, we were heavy on multiboxers and quite some of them were doing it without isboxer and i assure you we won almost all of our contests. Back when incursions were more popular it was us or ISN who people would join for the highest isk/h.  
---
(If you're refering to multiboxing the whole fleet i certainly agree with you, i think the highest i saw functioning efficiently without any third party software was 4 accounts - 2 Logi, 2 DPS - and that dude was an exceptional talent)
---
CCP has never seeded Plex.
---
Choose your character look, not the race.     
---
You can train all skills on any character.
---
OK, it's capital ratters that don't loot, and leave it for some newbie to do it.
---
Nowhere in his post he is "grr nullsec" ... but you are going "grr reasonable facts and data" again ....
---
Salvage will be still there.
---
I actually had a feeling this was exactly what was going to happen. I did call it several times. What I didn't think was that it would set in on week 3 of blackout. I assumed/hoped the excitement and fun would carry on at least for a couple months, I knew it wasn't going to carry on for long, but I'm worried now it may already be wrapping up
---
waaaaay back in the day before plex existed, you'd post on the timecode bazaar forum either buying or selling, and there was a secure page on the account management site where you could enter a time code, a destination account, and an amount of isk to charge for it, and they'd get a notification and accept or deny it
---
If the money is the good, and it becomes more difficult to get, the prices of everything else will go up as you'll have to trade more of everything else to get the same amount of money. 
---
As an example:
---
Today: 1 isk = 1 trit. Tomorrow: 1 isk = 2 trit. Could be an increase in trit supply (trit inflation), could be isk deflation. Cannot be isk inflation.
---
Today 1 isk  = 1 trit. Tomorrow: 2 isk = 1 trit. Could be a shortage of trit (trit deflation), could be isk inflation. Cannot be isk deflation.
---
You see? It doesn't matter what resource is being deflated. Isk, ore, ships, Plex, etc. Deflation causes the value of THAT resource to increase and gain purchasing power in measured value.
---
But now with the blackout and no perfect intel you can be dropped easily.
---
Well F1 is my cloak most the time XD
---
That's not what the post is asking... It is asking if there is a point in Skilling into Industrials of races other than Gallente.
---
[Round here we just say "Manager"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdGrC9S4PYA)
---
Dont worry, CCP got you. Eve is on its way to be dumbed down.
---
Eve is/was hard for every 1 who started, but people now a days feel entittled. I play a week and i want everything a player has that was playing for 5 years or longer.
---
Frak that, learn to work for it and earn it, or just use your your credit card and loose your expensive ships and mods, cause you dont have a freaking idea who the mechanics work.
---
Well when you get to the freighter level, caldari have the most cargo vs gallente who have the most ehp, minmatar are the most agile (lol), and the amarr freighter is a thing that exists.
---
Gallente probably does have the best base industrial tree, though.
---
I just started a couple of days ago. Got through the tutorial and started taking missions from the agents (as suggested at the end of the tutorial). Even though it‚Äôs training for new players, it‚Äôs not exactly a cake walk either. On my first day I got a mission to use probes to find and then travel to a relic site. That was basically all the information I had. So I undocked, and... now what?!
---
Took me a while to figure out how to use the sensor probes, rescanning after moving them around, etc. My first instinct was to be frustrated at the lack of information before sending me on my way, but I very quickly warmed up to this style of training. Figuring out what you can do and how it can help you is part of the game, and part of the fun.
---
As I said I‚Äôm incredibly new, and browsing around this subreddit I feel like I need an EVE -&gt; English translator most of the time, but I can already tell that I‚Äôm going to love this game.
---
same
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs advocating net zero inflation, I think he‚Äôs advocating avoiding 80%+ inflation driven by a massive bot network... and he‚Äôs right. Not sure why you‚Äôre trying to take away from that, especially in this way. CCP may not have perfect control but they have *plenty* of levers to pull to effect change in the economy.
---
Our last rental payment is in a few days so we've timed it pretty well.
---
It is underpowered for short fights determined by burst damage. But can't be beaten in battles of attrition.
---
Well that a shame.... But unfortunately that's how it always go.... Bad example wow used to be "hard" now it's face roll on the keyboard and you clear everything, loot is shown in your face that's better than raiding
---
&gt; Example 1 + Example 2 = Inflation ... simple as that
---
They increase inflation yes, but the EVE economy as a whole was has been operating at (compared to real life economies) astronomically high levels of inflation for nearly a decade prior to that. So while you're correct, just reverting those changes doesn't really solve our problem.
---
ah sry :D
---
Krabs are going to dock up until their wallets start screaming and they start to need to plex their many alts.
---
This is what I mean by they are still in the trump phase, like china was/is.
---
Hoping that Trump gets deposed, just like hoping that blackout goes away.
---
Once mineral prices skyrocket, once their wallets start nearing 0, then the krabs will come back out.
---
Also, I anticipate ccp to boost nullsec isk and decrease abyssals.
---
There's been a noticeable drop in the amount off ratters I come across. But I've seen much more small gangs defending the entrance to their pipe or similar. And I will take on skirmish with a five man gang over 50 VNIs any day.
---
Aim in desired freighter blockade runner and DST.       
---
For specialized cargo it don't matter so much if you have it on lvl 3 or 5.
---
Minmatar align times are amazing if you go to low sec or null.
---
no loop here, I just like the lowsec area around Stacmon
---
Yes, because eve needs more bumping mechanics.
---
obvious sockpuppet is obvious
---
Anoms nerfs - Black out they slap nullsec krabs.
---
Alpha nerfs they slap F2P people cause alpha bots already left to blackout.
---
Changes are good but incorrect  implementation is killing numbers.
---
 **Local was a great social tool for blue donut, they removed  foundation of things they were talking about on fanfest. Whole research about keeping new people in game is on fire.**
---
They obviously need to adjust the isk/hr, and they need to wait for it to have an impact on the economy.
---
I think once vast reserves of minerals are consumed and the price spikes that we will see rorquals back out.
---
I also anticipate some sort of reward tweak for nullsec, perhaps increasing the reward/drop rate for DED loot to help feed the abyssal sites, and increase isk/hr in nullsec, and provide more targets floating about.
---
&gt; you are just feeding free kills.
---
You know, people could go out and fight for fun?
---
What if isk and trit both deflate at the same time?  This is what many people are arguing will happen, that people will find ways other than ratting and mining to make isk.
---
&gt;Was this CCPs short sighted intention all along? To make goons and the other big blocks the only safe havens for krabs to krab, and force people to bunker up in the big blocs, anyone who doesn't comply instead chooses to not even log in? 
---
That's what the effect will be I think - I can confirm, I roamed from Fountain to Cloud  Ring, to Fade, Deklein, to Branch and saw a few ceptors, a Merlin and an Astero on d-scan.  Sure Init's still around but outside of the J5A general area, it's dead jim.  It's dead.
---
thing about eve is, that if someone goes full wallet warrior, he gets killed and then memed on eve reddit. so really pay2win in eve is more like pay2bemocked
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs advocating net zero inflation, I think he‚Äôs advocating avoiding 80%+ inflation driven by a massive bot network
---
I wasn't implying that he was arguing for net zero, my point was that CCP has a completely different set of mechanisms for controlling the economy compared to real world central banks so any argument that begins with "well in real life..." is automatically invalid.
---
KF member, no F1 for me, it CTRL+click on broadcasts to start repping like mad.
---
Logi is love, logi is life.
---
For t1 industrials gallente is the best hands down. Ive been a big fan of the Occator when it comes to deep space transports for a while, but really with the Occator you have to choose between godly tank or decent agility. I'm currently training my hauling alt for Minmatar industrials because the Mastodon can fit a pretty monstrous shield tank while also having plenty of lows for align speed.
---
Metropolis, Delve, Feythabolis, Omist, Fountain, Tenerifis
---
Have all had content and that is just the last couple of days. People are out. I never said it was like week one, I said the content is there. 
---
Personally I think the content will only go up as the various groups start adjusting to the new reality and the 'chicken little world is ending' drama starts to fade. 
---
Will the overall production and NPC rating income go down? Absolutely and that is a good thing, it was becoming to easy to gain a massive amount of wealth in almost complete safety in Null.
---
The funny thing is that certain massive Null powers were on here from day screaming 'this will only help us and we are very concerned for the little guy so take this away NOW'. Their jimmies are rustled and they are complaining because this blackout adds some danger to their safety net.
---
&gt;without a high risk of losing what we trained and worked so hard to learn to fly and the isk to fit.
---
Boohoo
---
This is exactly why this change had to happen.
---
"I cant endlessly farm without taking risk of my giant super refined max isk/hr krab boat."
---
You literally said you have a medium sized coalition and a corp that is "pvp focused" and then followed it up by "reee we can't totally no risk farm".
---
You're the reason this change happened.
---
&gt; Nerfs to Alphas and possibly VNIs  
---
What are you on about ? VNI's are probably the most overpowered non T2 cruiser in the game right now.
---
&gt; 50 VNIs any day.
---
Especially when 49/50 of those VNIs will warp away the second you land on grid with them because of local and bots.
---
That and sharing Terribad fits in fleet.  Still have hope for my dual tanked salvage Thanatos.
---
While this is true, a change could be made.  
---
Simply make all of eves bounty payouts be items bought up by NPC market orders at a rate that CCP monitors. Same would work for LP rewards and the like.  
---

Tbh, as others have said, what makes Eve hard is the sheer scale. Just when you figure out one aspect, you realize that you want to learn this other hard thing. 
---
The good news is:
---
-- You don't have to learn the whole game at once. Take a little time to get your feet under you, then decide where you want to focus. 
---
-- Despite its reputation for being a hostile game, Eve is **extremely** newbie friendly. There are corps dedicated to teaching and plenty of online resources. People generally go out of their way to help new players. 
---
And the first time you get ganked and your favorite shiny ship get blown up ... Convo your attacker and ask them how they got you. 9/10 times they'll help you out and maybe even toss you a few isk. (The other time they'll probably call you a pussy and laugh at you ... :shrug: ... just roll with it ... those are the mouth breathers).
---
Have fun and don't be afraid to ask. The only stupid questions are the ones you ask during combat comms &gt;.&gt; (I'll see myself out).
---
I think we're a good bunch. You could do worse!
---
May the blackout never end. Best change  to the game in the last ten years.
---
Not if you're in a super. You'll get counter dropped easily. lol. All those thirsty nerds who haven't had their big toys seen a day of combat will pile up on you like rabid dogs. Ever seen titan gatecamps in delve? Yeah, they're desperate to get some kill marks.
---
It's part of the charm. No local means people just have to pay far more attention to eve. The alternative for this nyx would've been taking a mid to somewhere  like MLQ for instance, but he tried to take a shortcut and rightfully paid the price. He rolled the dice on it rather than doing some extra work. Makes complete sense to me that it ended the way it did for him. To me the blackout solves so many problems and I cant think of any that it actually makes except 'less people krabbing' but that's all anecdotes anyway from people and their krab friends.
---
Black out makes good and accurate intel important.
---
Safer move routes for caps is necessary.
---
Hampers krab antifight defense tools like NEAR.
---
Stops lazy and overpowered intel.gathering from local.
---
Adds excitement to the game as you dont know when you're goong to be PVPing next- as it should be.
---
This basically solves all the shit people have been whining about and adds benefits on top. Personally, I haven't had this much fun in eve since goons deployed to hak.
---
Keep in mind I do have a few biases when speaking on this: I am an fc &amp; dir in the biggest corp in the game and a member of one side of the blue donut.
---
&gt; just reverting those changes doesn't really solve our problem.
---
That is correct. Also the damage done by these changes creating ISK inflation (and with Lifeblood Rorquals Ore deflation) is already done and would not be reverted.
---
join on our KarmaFleet lobby and hang out.
---
For sure the number of real player has dropped a lot. I find few fight.
---
But in another way it has fucked up many bot; and this is good
---
I think it's emptiness is what everyone is concerned about, friend.
---
I've never understood why the highest paying PVE in EVE was doable solo. Incursions at least made sense. You had to have a good fleet setup and it was pretty hard to AFK/multi-box it. 
---
There should be similar "dungeons" in null sec. Where the harder missions or dungeons require a fleet to complete. But the payout/drops are pretty good.
---
Very hard because very bored
---
It's as obvious as Punisher bait. As if a newbie would use the words "perfect Intel".
---
Just put on your tinfoil hat, sip the koolaid, and nod.
---
Seriously. What is so hard about pressing the V key?
---
Highest I did was 1 DPS + 1 Logi, and I considered it quite challenging, even being used to triple-box regularly in PvP Fleets ...
---
This sounds familiar, almost as if it was predicted the second CCP announced blackout....
---
This is exactly where it was going to head, there is a need to do significantly more changes to support all play styles under blackout.  You only have to look at the number of forum posts for the initial announcements - we only reply in such numbers when it's a bad change.
---
If the day comes you find yourself in Null, and look around and all the ice is the wrong fuel for your ship...
---
You might find yourself spending twice as much on fuel than you should.  (Or you can't mine your own fuel.  Or you have to buy it at high sec hubs).  
---
Otherwise, Gallente Industrial FTW.
---
You cant say, "im fine with it" and then say in the next sentence, "it clearly needs to have some tweaking". You are contradicting yourself.
---
What you are saying here is exactly what I said above, "no local in its current form is stupid and broken. A balanced version could surely work".
---
We are not on different sides. I never have issues with nerfs (more or less) but I do have an issue with such a massive change without any balancing. You know when they last did this? Rorquals. I was against that aswell. Its not good gameplay and not good for a game to do such massive changes without actually thinking ahead and balancing it. And if Rorquals turned out to be such a clusterfuck then you can imagine what would happen if no local got implemented for real without any tweaks. It would be the same levels of clusterfuck, just in another direction.
---
For the record, I actually like certain parts of the blackout. But that doesnt make me blind to the issues and not because I will personally be affected by them, Im high SP, high isk and have been around long enough to know what to look for. But I like new players because they make the game more vibrant and if no new players join then the game is truly fked. And guess where the new players have gone the last couple of years? NS, cause we recruited and took care of them. If they cant live in NS then they will most likely not even play the game. And no local hurts who the most?
---
Define overpowered.
---
ehm hello? you can't just "change" the value of a currency by choice.
---
There is a reason why central banks destroy tons of money every year to maintain the low level of inflation.
---
Yeah. I've been checking etherium on a regular basis because I had been watching several very juicy things. Especially ird, D-I and Fizu those systems have or well had supers ratting and rorquals regularly. It's triumvirate systems so you know the hammer is coming. Slyce is easy pickings but they aren't putting anything juicy out. Just cheap garbage.
---
We caught a tri rorq last week but got a pretty nasty response fleet dropped on us quickly. Was a gf but we got gassed. They know what they are doing so it's not so appealing when slyce is just next door but my point is the targets I was watching have stopped doing what they were doing. It's aggravating
---
Bad bot
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99995% sure that Asks_For_Sources is not a bot.

---
Yep and a nos, still 45 second with guns and reps heated sans prop.
---
Minmatar DST takes up least amount of M3 in capitals SMA.
---
Minmatar Prowler has the fastest cloaked speed.
---
Impel has the highest armor tank.
---
Bustard has the best highsec tank.
---
It's an interesting idea but I don't think it really solves the problem. CCP already track exactly how much is being generated on a monthly basis by bounty prizes and everything else (it's literally in the MER). 
---
The problem is like, say CCP wanted to halve money creation over 6 months. They couldn't just halve bounty prizes and mission payouts and call it a day. There'd be massive ripple effects throughout the EVE economy. Easy example would be less anoms run = less escalations = less deadspace supply. Less missions run = less LP = less availability of almost all faction modules. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm just saying they're less direct than what a Central Bank can do.
---
Ah yes 90% of all the explorers I have seen only go to a site as someone else in their corp scanned it down for them. Totally not randoms flying all over to find sites. Epic sources btw.
---
Good to know... I will be skipping this one!
---
Freighter only requires racial industrial III, so it doesn't matter. Similarily, JF only needs freighter IV, for some reason I always thought it required V.
---
Wait till you moon mine in null sec in that orca .... $$$$$$$$$
---
The Ammar industrial has the highest(general) cargo space since it has the most lowslots where you fit cargo expanders.
---
The industrial line has the advantage of the various types of cargo(pi, mineral, ore, etc) like you said
---
The Minmatar has that ammo industrial which is not bad but you hardly ever need a t1 industrial designed to carry ammo and cap charges only.
---
Freighter wise however:
---
Depends whether you want max cargo(cargo expanders) or max ehp or ballance between the 2.
---
The Charon with cargo expanders has the highest cargo space
---
Second would be Obelisk, then Providence, then Fenrir.
---
If you want to go bulkheads: Charon-Obelisk-Provi-Fenrir
---
If you want ballance between tank and cargo:
---
Both the Providence and the Obelisk work well with armor resists 
---
You sacrifice some ehp but you gain more cargo space and align faster.
---
If memory serves me, A Providence with 2 bulkheads and 1 armor resist, has more ehp, more cargo and warps faster than a full bulkhead Charon
---
Obelisk is in a similar position with the Providence.
---
Fenrir on the other hand, you either bulkhead it or put expanders on it.
---
You could go brave and fit it with inertial stabilizers since Fenrir has the fastest align of all the freighters but it wont save you from a bumping Machariel.
---
All in all it depends where you use them and for what.
---
Wormhole generators exist already. Contact a local c5 sales rep for details.
---
The warm fuzzy part of my heart thinks this is sweet. The other 90% thinks that they‚Äôre just trying to get you addicted to skins early for more revenue.
---
&gt;I am toying with a triple rep fit and it literally tanks 1,300dps overheated.
---
a Vexor  can tank 1700+ with two reps, but at what cost Dato , at what cost
---
Next thing you'll be saying that this is false
---
&gt;TLDR (of this bit): Plex inflationary pressure is too high and you can almost certainly say botting is driving it, because nothing else keeps up.
---
And that skill injectors rise and fall with plex prices. HERESY, someone call the ReeeeeeeeInquisition.
---
It has to be simplified because that's the only way ANY economic principle can be defined. The term is ceteris paribus (all other things equal). Everything else is a macro 'science' and only sustainable because enough people believe in it. Like religion. 
---
As with all scientific testing, when you change two theoretical variables, you have no way of knowing the real cause for the effect or how big the influence is.
---
Lol we are pvping and loving it but we need to earn isk to pay for it! We can‚Äôt all be credit card warriors like you bro :D
---
EVE Online prior to Citadels patch.
---
Is the rumor true, that Eve players have the worst BO at Eve meets? The few times they climb out of their mother's basements and enter RL Space.
---
Personally I enjoy home vacations. I've got livestock and they don't get to take vacations. I'm sure I could find someone to tend to a few pigs, chickens, ducks, my two Great Pyrenees aren't real fond of other people coming on our property other than us, they tend to be pretty loud and besides being very big (our male is 130lbs). Bit hard to board a 130lb dog who doesn't like confined spaces/enclosed rooms. So we just take daytrips around here, take time off and stay home, do things around the house, just enjoy the time off. Its relaxing enough for us just being here with all our animals.
---
As great as it sounds it's an unrealistic pipe dream. They are here to stay
---
&gt; Feels like I have no reason to specialise in gallente industrials if I have to pick one industrial race skill to specialise in. 
---
Good news. You don't 'have' to pick one to specialize in.
---
if you nerf the resources in null sec.... why go to null sec in the first place then?
---
I mean i can also make 300 mil per hour on avarage in high sec with abyssal sites, or high sec incursions?
---
If null sec does not have anything extra then high sec or low sec, why would you want to hold sov?
---
Got a supper last night.
---
&gt;"I cant endlessly farm without taking risk of my giant super refined max isk/hr krab boat."
---
Thats the mentality I don't like, not you farming.  We all gotta eat.
---
"Blackout is bad because now supers and rorquals have risk included in their isk/hr"
---
CCP nerfed skill requirements at some point.      
---
T2 industrials also still require industrial V ?       
---
I think.
---
Well, evedroid hasn't been updated yet. But off my napkin math adjusting in the changes.. a pvp brawl fit that tanks 792 DPS and deals 682 dps.. on a cruiser that has pretty dang good speed and is quite cheap.. 
---
it is overpowered.. 
---
Heck I'm quite sure you can own the hell out of abyssal sites with them. Running 2x heavy, 2x med, 1x light drone plus the guns gives it more dps than it used to have with 5x heavys. Then on top of it, you get that local rep bonus..
---
They didn't nerf it now, they buffed it.  But I think it is going to get an actual nerf in future.
---
I remember seeing this all the way back in 2007 and was one of the reasons that made me try out EvE.
---
The difficulty is mostly going to be determined by your mindset. Don't try to be an expert in everything right at the beginning. Focus on understanding the general concepts and work your way up; you'll get better in time. Eventually you'll start to see how different things overlap.
---
Setting up PvP takes more time only in a sandbox game like EvE. Don't have time? GTFO. Go play WoW or Farmville.  
---
If you want a game that does not require multi hour uninterruped gaming sessions, then go play a game that already provides that. Stop being a whinny bitch and stop trying to change the world to your wants and needs alone. Eve is already infested with 35-years old 'adults' with kids and no amount of free time but still desperately try to cling on gaming because their life is so miserable that instead of spending time with their family or jobs, they choose Eve as their only hobby. Pathetic.
---
By increasing the SP you get in X time you increase the 'reward' for not logging in. 
---
and this game already has a problem with people playing skillplans online. If this is here to give the little guy a push its not gonna work out so hot because again they're rewarding not playing (and I will admit it's a new thing).  But hey, im sure all those bros waiting to play someday totally keep subscribing if they blow up a red triangle once a day.
---
Im fine with them introducing it in its current form, and then running some iteration/tweaking on it. Read what I write.
---
I'm obviously not saying its perfect, but its still much much better then what it was.
---
&gt;If they cant live in NS then they will most likely not even play the game.
---
Topkek.
---
What ores are there?
---
I see some flawless arkonor and bistots sometimes
---
That's not the same as feeding free kills.
---
"Why can't my pve be totally risk free again!"
---
Improving the isk/hour is a terrible idea.
---
It widens the gap between the haves and the have nots.
---
All you do is give more isk to big established groups at the detriment of everyone else.
---
The Bestower is the only industrial-level ship that has the potential of a non-specialized cargo hold over 40k.
---
Moon materials won't budge. Harvesting times can be set to alliance prime time, once per weekend or once per month per moon. People will certainly log in everything for this. My Corp can suck a moon dry in 1-1.5 hours while we sit in our citadels with 50-60 capitals waiting to jump
---
CCP is fixing boting by rap-eing legit players.
---
Many people changed farming to Skill farms its silent bomb and ccp joined forces giving free SP. Plex prices going up in next 2-3 months.
---
I'm in the USA.
---
Thereby we see the new mechanics found a way to punish ppl who decided to defend their little pocket. You dock up: no one comes back. You fight: oh hey they fight! and you get roamed twice as much. The old dec system in hs used to be cancer like that too.
---
Just because it‚Äôs not real life doesn‚Äôt mean real life doesn‚Äôt provide meaningful comparisons and lessons, though. Sure the tuning levers are a bit different, but at the end of the day Eve is modeled on real economies much more than most other games, so... automatically invalid? Nah, I don‚Äôt think so. If you wanna call it invalid, give a real reason not just dismiss it for being a comparison you don‚Äôt believe in.
---
Oh look, its the same damn thing as my other favorite game, Team Fortress 2. No sink, rising prices, and now PLEX is 4mil a pop and TF2 Keys are like 34 ref a pop.
---
I'm not trying to change the game.
---
Eve already catered for what I am describing.
---
Spoken like a player that contributes nothing to CCP's bottom line.
---
Yeah i think i remember that guy and even heared about that particular incident. Iirc he lost his fleet and didnt really manage to kill anything at all right?  
---
But yeah, it is quite a challenge but it's propably also a question of what you do more / like doing more. 
---
The dude i mentioned (one of our FC's and co leader of DIN, Kaphrah, some might remember that name) did 2 Scimis, a Mach and sometimes he brought a Vargur as 4th account while he FC'd and did LC, AAA and MTAC. At some points he brought us through TCRC's with only 4 logi, 2 of which he was flying himself.  
---
But in PVP he barely managed to use a single account properly. I'm honestly still a bit surprised that there was such a massive difference as if he had displayed the same talent and motivation in PVP as in PVE the dude could have become a great.... actually no, he **was** a content creator after all, just for PVE and not for PVP. Still i kinda wish he had found motivation to become a PVP FC after DIN dissolved. I bet that would have been fun times.
---
It may be worth considering joing eve university after you've got the basics.
---
I spent 4 or 5 months with them. They run scheduled missions, courses, have a great webpage. I died a lot on their flights since its normally just noobs and a experienced leader but they replace your lost ships for free as long as you geared how they recommended.
---
You can definitely remote rep drones, not sure about fighters.
---
Keep the skills. Next you‚Äôll learn about pvp (the best part of the game), and the battle orca is a vicious beast.
---
RR?
---
remote repair?
---
I want my pve rewards to be worth the risk. This isn't the case in null right now.
---
That seems... Too narrow to say that no comparison can be made ever, at all. The existing mechanisms to influence the issue are different, but that doesn't mean the problem and desired end states can't be similar.  
---
A nail and a screw require two different tools and they interact with the material in different ways, but ultimately you're still trying to stick two pieces of wood together.
---
Amarr is the prettiest!
---
this is what everyone who wasnt a major weedbrain said would happen
---
Amarr JF would use Delve topes which should make it the cheapest to keep fueled.
---
If you are in null sec, you may need to change your overview. Its a different stuff called something like "exceptional moon ore" ??
---
It'd not quantum physics that's the only thing I could tell
---
&gt;  Fuck anything with a jumpdrive that isn't a blops.
---
What did jump freighters ever do to you? :c
---
Hahahahahaha I like
---
As someone who works in finance (private investment group within a large firm) I‚Äôve never heard of income being referred to as ‚Äúreward‚Äù in the real world.
---
Nor is equity the riskiest play by itself. You have options, leverages and quite a few other products that have more risk.
---
Not to mention you have products that you can throw your money in that provides downside protection with a cap on the upside. The real world has some cool products you can get into.
---
I‚Äôm still stuck on how ‚Äúequity is the riskiest investment‚Äù tho.
---
why not get all of them?
---
I think New Eden as a whole will be good for a year or more on current stocks
---
Exploration is not really more or less dangerous I think. The static stuff like anoms and mining is what's dangerous
---
wait what kind of level of sites can you do solo in garmur ?
---
This was pretty much what alot of us said would happen, but again it was downvoted into oblivion because of "grr nullblocks this will be gudfights forever". People never look at the long term picture, why do you think there are big blue blocks now, and people are flocking to them ? If you want to rat, mine, own a capital, or especially a super or titan, you will likely go here. You can fly it safe, get srp'd if you lose it, and rat/mine under an umbrella.  There's literally no downside, just pick the flavor of null block you like to drink. The rest where there is renting, no super umbrella or organization of that kind (aka goons/Delve model), won't exist. This is the new meta, and players will be pushed even further into carriers and supers - not away from them. I say this myself as someone who left both Eve and and a large null block due to my own boredom, having flown supers and titans, and just reached what many would term the pinnacle of Eve. This new meta only will make the bigger groups more compact and stronger, and the smaller independent ones weaker, and leave vast areas of null empty other than those under a super umbrella. 
---
The real question I'd ask CCP, is what is the overall cost ? How many players did you gain vs lost ? Once things settle out, and the ones that came back realize it is as the OP says, will they leave again, and the players that left never return. Are you left now with even less players, and the game in an even worse situation if the intent was to sew chaos in null sec ? Only thing that happened was to strengthen it, and even increase the bonds among the multiple large null groups that before opposed each other due to there common enemy - CCP.
---
Or what actually happened, we had a 20 minute skirmish, killed a few, lost a few, had a lot of pilots in structure, regrouped, cooled off and rolled for a new region. We never even got into their ratting pocket.
---
But you strike me as the kind of person who sees it has his god-given right to krab in peace and never have to interact with other people in a PVP-game. So why do I even bother.
---
My exact thought. I‚Äôve never heard of ‚Äúreward‚Äù being used when discussing generating income at work in four years.
---
they are built around the same core structure
---
Yep we all gotta eat but the majority of players will do it as part of a small number of massive coalitions and you will reeee and quit because of supercap umbrellas! 
---
If you read my post again, I am not complaining about the blackout, I am expressing the simple view that all it will do is form a small number of massive coalitions and swallow any small Nullsec alliances, and everyone will go back to farming isk in safety with 300/400 alts/pvpers online and in response fleets 24/7 ready to drop the smallest gang that tackles anything! You think delve is bad! Wait until all Nullsec is like that
---
Specialized industrials have less cargo space, than a DST has in a fleet hangar (well , I believe one of them had more when you have gallente industrial V), so there is actually no reason to train anything else than the glorious beast the Impel is.
---
Jump to Crystal clone in Quiet highsec system, board Gila, level 4 gamma filaments, massive Profit. Unless you take the safer road like me and market pvp
---
Just ask lotsa questions in the rookie help channel and make sure you finish the tutorial completely and pay attention.
---
You should be okay with the basics of basics then.
---
This can actually happen by warping to the sun as the server crashes, although there are other ways that that can happen. For example, I warped into a gatecamp by mistake and got killed in my gila. However, the servers completely crashed during it, leaving me at 0 hull, full shields, and spamming warp to the sun. After about 10 minutes of not being able to warp or die, I logged off, leaving me with [this killmail.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/62827969/) However, a corpmate was going through the system later that day and saw my gila on dscan. We came back to combat probe it down later, and found that it was in the middle of the sun. Unfortunately, we could not reach it by warping to it, though someone eventually got it later, as seen in [this killmail.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/62845596/) 
---
As a result of the server crashing, ccp restored my gila, where I then proceeded to [lose it](https://zkillboard.com/kill/62935941/) to a roaming wormhole gang inside of the c4 pulsar that I had recently started living in. So that‚Äôs the story of how I lost the same gila 3 times. 
---
Please forgive my fitting skills - I was fairly new at the time, and thought getting a gila to be able to tank c4 pulsar sites was good.
---
the closer the rock is to the refinery, the closer it is to spawn a belt
---
Then CCP comes in and dunks the respawnable anoms and forces the blocks to spread out from more then a handful of systems just all turbo krabbing with rorquals and supers?
---
TLDR: anywhere that is now dead = bot havens.
---
Wait, you mean exactly what grr goons and other large null sec blocs warned everyone would happen is happening? Shocking.
---
[                                           ]
---
Uh-uh... **PLEX price is** ***still*** **1,919 525,000 and isnt planning to drop.** Must be teh bots.
---
No, we don't.  You want PVE that has players in a common location, so that they're on comms and in standing fleets, and are in a position to ship up to fight if something interesting comes along.  More support for single player, in a wormhole 20 minutes out from home when a fight looks like its coming is not what the game needs.
---
Semantics. For the average retail investor equities are the most risky investment.
---
I think you are missing the point here.        
---
Skillgoo was expensive as rorquals and capitals were desired goal that people rushed.            
---
I expect plex drop nicely as people don't inject to them so much, at least in terms of rorquals.
---
&gt; controlled positive inflation
---
There's nothing controlled about the jump in PLEX pricing over the past few years, though. 2-3 years ago 1.5b for a single month's sub was normal, the fact it might deflate to something that more resembles a longterm climb rather than a 25% jump in a fairly short term is a good thing.
---
&gt;which either means they are playing less or have quit altogether.
---
Alternatively, it means less multiboxing and more consolidated play with less accounts. Plus, bots are a factor too; i don't think anyone care if bots quit or drop into much smaller numbers.
---
I agree, keeps me on edge for space monsters and combat scanners. I love the creepy vibe, get the job done fast and prepare to run if anything move is now my memo.
---
I can't believe they never did that before.. I'm glad it's all good but jesus the years..
---
EVEdroid? This is new to me. I take it that it's like PYFA or EFT?
---
I surely don't want to say that. But the obvious answer is yes. It's just not fun for anyone. Actually it's lame as fuck.
---
The price difference is only really significant if you live in/around Delve
---
Fit T2 siege.
---
&gt; Keep in mind I do have a few biases when speaking on this: I am an fc &amp; dir in the biggest corp in the game and a member of one side of the blue donut.
---
and you still don't seem to toot your own horn *nearly* often enough :eyes:
---
"steadhacs" lmao
---
i disagree with you on principle; i think we're beginning to see the slide that ends with mass unsubbing from disenfranchised krabs. "good riddance," you might say, but from my perspective there haven't been nearly enough people playing this game for the last 3-4 years to justify the amount of space that currently exists, thus the proliferation of renting, and forcing people out will just exacerbate things
---
i was perfectly comfortable hunting with local using cloaky camping and blue scouting. if you're finding it easier to hunt now as opposed to with local, you probably weren't trying very hard before tbqh
---
Would be helpful to know why you think OP is wrong.
---
Looks like a monster now tbh
---
Like some of the others said, it helps to be in a group. 
---
There are a few newbie-oriented groups you might want to look at. I'm in Dreddit (the Reddit corp), so of course I think you should join us. Other popular groups are Eve University (They literally run classes in space), Karmafleet (part of Goonswarm, an old an famous group from the website Something Awful), Pandemic Horde (I've heard some complaints but it's probably fine to start out at least), and Brave Newbros (in the same Test Alliance as we are).
---
Dreddit gives out free ships and skillbooks, pays for your ship when you lose it on a fleet, and has "no questions are dumb" help channels in Discord and in-game. The most important benefit for you might be the mentorship program, where you'd get paired up with a veteran to answer your basic questions, and help you get the game set up and voice comms and everything else. That will also help you find fun, whatever fun means to you.

We have fleets run by Dreddit, our alliance (an in-game group of corporations), and other corps in our alliance basically throughout the day and night, so there's plenty of fighting to be had it you want that. It's pretty cool to be on a fleet with 250 of your closest friends, sailing off to die honorably against an enemy fleet. Even as a new player you can join those fleets. For you, the ships are even free! 
---
We own the bottom right corner of the map, around Esoteria. As an old big corp/alliance we have lots of IT services to help you like a wiki, voice comms, forums, skill planning tools, enemy movement Intel sites, and much more. 
---
We are an active and friendly bunch, in an active and friendly alliance. There are other good places to learn to play the game, but we are the best. 
---
If you're interested, go to www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the application process and public Discord link. 
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose! 
---
Also went from 125 mb drone bandwidth to 75 mb. big difference
---
EvE is a complex game. However there are new player friendly groups you can join to help you learn.
---
The biggest aspect of EvE I had to learn was that playing EvE by yourself is not very fun for a lot of people. Playing EvE with friends in a corporation is awesome. Join a new player group.
---
My recommendation is Pandemic Horde. Google Join Horde EvE or pm me if you need more details.
---
&gt;I logged off, leaving me with this killmail. However, a corpmate was going through the system later that day and saw my gila on dscan.

---
Ofc you can, thats how you regulate inflation/deflation. 
---
Lol, thats not the real reason. You print new money and you just take the old out of circulation. You dont change interest rates fast enough to destroy tons of money each and every year.
---
Besides, fiat currency is nothing compared to the "real" moneybase. Most money is just numbers, not paper currency.
---
My man, simply put, thats not how economy actually works. You are not completely wrong but its basic, the economic system is very complex and in reality it looks a lot different than you might think after reading wikipedia. And you cant just adapt irl to a game because irl you have a financial sector which changes the picture. 
---
In a game, in Eve, you will in time start to feel the effects as prices on everything will start to go up since the basic mats are more expensive due to them being harder to mine/loot. Thats inflation. That means a loss of purchasing power. Its supply and demand, lower supply than demand will always lead to an increase in price, not decrease which you are arguing for.
---
And as you can see, no where have I mentioned the amount of isk because its not relevant, atleast on this level.
---
Up until now we have had higher supply than demand forcing prices down. So even though the total isk in the game was going up we were seeing deflation, pricereductions. People were getting more purchasing power.
---
I.e., he wasnt right. People think PLEX rules everything, it doesnt. And people think because its going down in price that means deflation. It doesnt. And lower PLEX doesnt mean higher purchasing power in general.
---
3 and below, probably. Maybe a 4 with a super bling fit, but not consistently
---
Nope ! gotta make a new fit!
---
unironically stellaris feels a lot like playing eve at the 4x level.
---
&gt;hat complain about it really just want easy killmails handed to the
---
Why you have described the newly elected member of the CSM Mar5meca Gold *perfectly.*
---
AMEN
---
You will need rorqs to mine in nullsec anyway. T1-T2 bargers are easy to nuke, and i dont think we have enough masochists to use expedition frigs.
---
We will see how many plex enter market, right now i can speculate drop on CCP wallet is reason of broken event and free SP so fast.
---
I'd get blown up for sitting in space while playing C&amp;C eve edition
---
look hateless workbench he is also streaming and his fits are solid
---
Who was recruiting the newer players dude? Was it HS, LS, WHs? Dont kek, its a serious problem. Serious enough for CCP to release retention numbers for. Do you think its a coincidence that the newbie friendly corps like KF, Brave, PH and so on are the biggest corps in the game?
---
And what do they all have in common? 
---
And who is no local hurting the most? People with isk and SP or the ones without? Is it subcaps or caps?
---
&gt; Any ideas?      
---
Just before logging off , create ingame a bug report stating what is happening after you click logoff.          
---
Then use the number you get and catch some CCP Dev on the discord asking how you can help them to narrow the issue.            
---
Like they want to know that something like this is happening and fix it.
---
&gt;I don't. In fact that's a big part of the problem right now. Without these huge expensive assets your ability to affect nullsec is practically zero, which pushes everyone into an endless arms race. M
---
Oh, you mean that human behaviors and institutional behavior within eve mirrors human behavior and state actors outside of eve? Shocker. There is really no way to fix this other than just completely deleting capitals, but then it will just be something else for you to complain about, like "WTF it is an endless arms race of tech 2 triglavian shit everyone is flying, making it really hard to kill people in tech 1 cruisers!"
---
that's a yikes there, wow
---
Well I don't know. Some people in the comments are reporting the complete opposite of my experience. Wether they are telling a fantasy or not, I'm not sure. My experience this week is what I posted.
---
I want the blackout to work but I don't want power consolidated within the large blocks who will just steam roll ever small group that thinks they carved out their little piece of null because they are just going to get farmed and wrecked.
---
Well, boosting rorqual with T2 drones out and procurers or retirveers is thing we see more.        
---
Don't know the numbers - about how much you get from rorqual mining using T2 drones after deducting the heavy water, but maybe more rorquals?            
---
Time will tell what is the best approach.
---
yup, with emergancy pvp capability of I'd have brain lag and didn't warp out when something appeared on dscan
---
Wait, what?
---
were skill injector/extractors not a ccp idea? So they created this problem them selfs. because they say dollar signs.
---
Bounce your rorq at 40km/s into space while you wait for 2.3 years to finally come to a stop.
---
There is literally zero drawback when using steam launcher. Even if steam is offline, you can run eve launcher from steam game directory. Also with some local currencies, plex (subscription currency in game) is much cheaper than the eve store.
---
Also if you create a CCP account, there is no way to link it to your steam account, so going with steam from the beginning will save you a lot of trouble.
---
&gt;In a real world economy you can control inflation by printing more/less money, and by taking money out of the system.
---
This is rarely if ever done, it's generally last measure and rarely results in anything good as it creates instability and no investors likes instability.
---
In a real world economy, governments adjust the bond prices and interest rates to adjust inflation/deflation as a primary measure. Like 99.99% of the time for the last 30 years, this has been how you fix it. Alternatively, they can force banks to hold unto more money (known as Reserve requirement) or the government can call in debts.
---
There are more alliance directors in KarmaFleet than Waffe.
---
As with most assessments here, OP is forgetting Low Sec and wormhole space. 
---
As of now (ie Blackout) WH space is MUCH safer (no hot drop) while at the same time much more lucrative. I'd strongly suggest balancing that before high. 
---
And low sec is pretty much like the middle child of the family: noone cares about it and is pretty much left for dead out in the open. 
---
Neither OP nor CCCP touched it with a ten foot pole and the argument "but it's FW space!" is so wrong that it boggles the mind.
---
‚ô•
---
I agree with this 100% , 110% in some days because inflation .
---
Not for those of us ratting in supers under an umbrella. Just for the subcap PVE ships, or capitals outside the umbrella, which... as others have pointed out, both have become so dangerous the risk vs reward calculation is just not worth it. 
---
Ergo, the subcaps and non-bloc/out of umbrella capitals that are good content for hunters are going the way of the dodo.
---
Somebody asked me 2 nights ago if I was CEO, it's always weird being asked that. Merkelchen is love.
---
HAI THERE I heard yall were talking about my beloved karmafleet is there anyone here who is genuinely interested in karma/decent Corp who is welcoming to all walks of life unless your complete shitheel?
---
This is the real question
---
For the people
---
LMAO. 
---
Promise we‚Äôll have more cheap ship verity for our next brawl :)
---
Three blasters, nos, mwd(restrained), scram, web, booster 2 (navy 800), ancil rep, standard rep, eanm, dcu, dda x2
---
Guns and reps heated with prop off.  45s of continuous runtime.  That leaves 2 charges in the repper as your cap shits the bed.  Simulation cant account for pulsing prop here and there but I assure you it is no good.  I ran the same exact fit before except I had 2 blasters and 2 nos, with 0 cap problems.  I also did 774 dps with 209hp/s sustainable rep.  Now you got 670 if you're running 2h2m1l and ion blasters with 284hp/s that caps itself out early.

If you wanna trade new VNI fits send a message to my eve mail (Rick Mordrethas)
---
Summer is an important variable to take into account and a very good point. I'm sure people are around they are just staying cloaked like said waiting for a fight they are 100% able to win. Which is sad but explains the "abandoned" drag bubbles I find laying around. Clearly somethings there waiting for an easy target, but that's a they want is an easy kill.
---
Well, yes but honestly this will stay as we can safely assume it currently generates more income than the subs them self.       
---
Problem is that CCP need to find the way to overcome this.       
---
Like capitals are not the issue here, they are in very fine position, damn even the rorquals are.              
---
Problem is that you can just print a pilot in 30minutes and not wait a 2+ years to have it.            
---
I knew many people that played for years and only capital they had was a subcase carrier, but the moment injectors came out they quickly got a super or two.             
---
Reason was simple.         
---
They didn't have to work 2 years in skilling to get to this ship.
---
I think if skill injectors get a nerv, botters will stop making money to inject titan alts because nobody will buy them anymore. I could be very wrong thoug because i dont live in ns.
---
They make a thing called air conditioner. It takes 5 minutes to install and costs $90-150
---
You can't do it to upwell structures, no, and it takes a surprising amount of time to do it given the raw HP that POS towers have. But if you even get it to 26% and refuel the stront bay, the timer resets.
---
You can also repair the sentry turrets &amp; batteries on a POS. There's good reason that CCP and most people want to move away from them, hah.
---
u totally rekktktktktkkt those skrubs preach on turbo
---
Not worth it over here in Europe ;)
---
The Badger has the best tank of any Tech I "Cargo" Industrial. (There's cargo T1 industrials and "fast align" industrials like the Nereus.)
---
If you can only pick one once I'd specialize in the Gallente line, their DST and BR are pretty good choices. Most people can't fit their BRs and DSTs properly.
---
F1 to fire reps! 
---
Zarm master race!
---
Pretty sure it'll force the little guys out of highsec and into LS areas. Remember there's more LS out there than FW space.
---
A properly fit fort will drop 1-3 billion in loot and salvage with empty Corp hangars
---
An astra generally yields 500-700 in loot and salvage with empty Corp hangars
---
But what about my DEAEKS?
---
Honestly if you‚Äôre burning in a cloaked hauler you‚Äôve probably done something wrong :P
---
I like Gallente mostly because in my experience people have Gallente trained most often and asking to borrow a Gallente one is easiest in a pinch
---
Oh obviously XD ty
---
we are allways looking for a brawl ;D u guys are great
---
Im still in high sec but my guild pops some moons
---
I feel like this is you trying to get rid of all your surplus injectors because you thought the price was going up
---
I support this as long as it's only player wrecks.
---
Amarr can do HG slaved A-type nano playing fit for a JF, makes the agility and cargo space not ass compared to bulkhead Anshar, and has similar EHP (also can web with a Nestor alt and then RR if you get ganked, potentially throwing off the ganker‚Äôs dps calculations)
---
it depends on what you gonna assign it for and what you are able to use skillwise...gallente is propably the best allrounder: second highest cargo for T1(iteron mark V) non-specialized, highest cargo for T1 specialized (miasmos, kryos, ). Amarr apart from having the highest cargo for T2 (impel) while having no tank at all if doing so, has the highest non-specialized T1 cargo (Bestower, full cargo fit) and the highest possible T1 cargo for MWD-cloak-trick (mwd-cloak-trick Bestower). Minmatar T1 shine in transporting ammo and charges as well as having the fastest align time + prowler is the best blockade runner due small signature which helps some way to evade decloaking, Freighter (Fenrir) has the smallest mass ideally for using capital size WH's (f.e. a B449, since you can jump with 3 of those simultaneously before wh collapses) . Caldari T1+T2 subcapital is a meme in comparison to any other faction but has exceptionally strong tank (which doesn't really helps if someone wanna gank you due pilot being afk).
---
You see where I'm going? It makes sense to skill for those. I'd recommend to get any faction industrials to lvl 1, anything beyond that is beneficial in some area and worse in the others so it is completely up to what you want. However, I also recommend to stick to a single faction as deepspace transporter for any of your characters you desire. If you doing a lot of pvp go T2 Minmatar, you wanna transport some things in non-pvp scenario go amarr T1 (is best isk per cargo ratio if non specialized) and since you are able to sit in any T1 just adapt to given circumstances.
---
Dont threaten me with a good time
---
Since CCP is experimenting now, I think delayed local might be a good middle ground. I would like it if they applied it, changed around the delay every few days or so.. You would know the bomber or boosher squad is in your area at least, but the hunters will still have a fighting chance of getting content too.
---
Its worth noting there are a lot of great new pilot Corps out there who deserve consideration and respect: Brave, Horde, Eve Uni, and Dreddit to name a few. 
---
KarmaFleet is a little different in that probably 15% of our total members are "newbies" and the rest are just really helpful veterans who like to be around the excitement and potential that new players bring. If your Eve experience ever starts feeling stale or you look at your empty Corp chat and wonder if Eve is the game for you, give one of the groups above a try before you hit that unsub button. Chances are you will like where you find yourself.
---
It's an adjustment to the game. People like to say that they're cutthroat and live it "Dangerously in nullsec because there are no rules" but they are behaving worst than hi-sec carebears. At least the hi-sec carebear can take a loss. 
---
Been playing EVE for a long time, started in 2006, and I haven't had this much fun in YEARS. I play another similar game (kind of), and they also don't tell you how many players are in the "system", there's a blob warning if a roaming gang of 11+ is in the zone, but that's it.
---
You blame the dead areas on blackout, but the real culprit has been the laziness and greediness of players. The only whining I am seeing are the people who were used to being in a low-risk/high reward situation in null, which never made any sense. Now that blackout has brought back balance with high-risk/high reward, people are whining about the risk?
---
I also don't understand this 
---
&gt;That's troubling to me because I enjoy playing eve, but playing an eve where space is dead I don't enjoy.
---
The only difference between now and before was that before you had a shit ton of bots and players who would insta-dock the moment anyone warp into the system. The space was already dead, just filled with zombies that vanished. You certainly didn't catch more people before.
---
Also, the irony there;
---
&gt;These places are lit up like Christmas trees with npcs killed and jumps per hour pre blackout. 
---
How about you talk about player ships destroyed?
---
I think you have never heard about 3xA-Type arks.         
---
They are also the cheapest one in usage as almost no one fly now archons and aeons.        
---
The titan fleets are not moved so often.
---
Yeah, its for the mobile though, quite nice when you get a crazy idea to see what it's stats will be..
---
The Dev takes forever to update it though, and it usually has a bug or two in each version.. but all in all its good.
---
That is, until you have a tech issue with the game and CCP tells you that "It's a Steam issue".
---
One thing is minmatar DST model is Much larger than occator‚Äôs making it easier to decloak when doing Mwd-cloak trick
---
Also minmatar one you‚Äôve gotta pick between I-stabs and WCS if you want to be agile enough to MWD cloak
---
Your math made me squirm. On the other hand. That's pretty good isk.
---
You mean like adding the "Drone MegaHorde" anomaly that pays well enough for 3-4 subcap players but is not solo-able by anything less than a super(not NOT).
---
just inject/skill everything to max, dont worry about it and just be happy when the meta changes
---
Wait, nullsec or wormhole space?
---
This video is 100% accurate
---
Heron/Imicus/Probe/Magnate
---
&gt;The obvious solution for people
---
The obvious solution for *carebears*. People seem to forget that nullsec is supposed to be high risk/high reward.
---
&gt;I have seen a number of friends more focused on Mining/Industry/Exploration/PVE drop out of Eve over the past few weeks
---
This is an adjustment to the core principle of eve, quite simply. People have been so used to no-risk/high-reward, that now that they have to work for it, they decide to quit.
---
i agree a 100% on this with you.
---
I still think they should remove skill injectors/extractors, its a nice short term money maker for ccp, but it has has made the time left for eve a lot shorter imo.
---
They could have made the triglavian skills non injectable, a missed change imo. Introduce more new races, mods and ships. But just make them non injectable (the skills).
---
New player can still get quickly into the excisting stuff with injectors, if the want, but just like older players would have to train the new stuff, the "old" way.
---
Abyssal Sites getting over-run with just result in the limited output crashing in value. Eventually it won't be as worth it.
---
If you want a ship purely for scanning, I‚Äôd recommend the heron. Extra mids for more scanning modules. You may need to raise your scan skills to level 4 to use them though, I cannot recall.
---
I was trying to avoid saying this, but I've been thinking the same
---
A probe(minmatar frigate) is a really fast option, if you want to be able to defend yourself the heron(caldari) frigate is a great option. Both are cheap.
---
Yea math is abit off, sorry.  Shoulden't post when kinda tired (And we have a heatwave). The resulting isk/h is valid though
---
This is the correct answer.  Astero if you wanna go crazy but it's not needed.  Get your scanning skills to 4.  The difference is significant.
---
Don't be poor, get a t3c, you won't regret it, so will people hunt you down
---
Isn't it ironic that you and so many nullsec carebears are kicking and screaming that their no-risk/high-reward scheme has been stomped by the blackout?
---
Well sorry for disappointing you my friend i dont pve.
---
I dont see why it hurts you so much to consider the obvious. Your story seems fun. Bet you wanna come back there right? And others too :) the loop is set
---
Yes definitely that, forgot
---
Well, you need to get those skills up.
---
Any of the t1 scanners will work well: Heron, Probe, Imicus, or Magnate.
---
You can fit gravity capacitor rigs and astrometric mid-slot modules to improve your scanning strength, but you should be able to scan through a whole system in 5 minutes.
---
That shit was for others reading it who dont know who I am, IE 99% of reddit it wasnt to toot any horn.
---
I'm not a fan of cloaky camping myself as that restrains krabs in the same kind of way people say the blackout does. Yeah blue alts are good times but in my tz can be pretty conspicuous. 
---
Local has always given far too much free intel. Its about time it was restricted.
---
It is possible. I once chased a bot Barghest that did just that; warp to star, bounce off, cloak mid-bounce while the ship was still going faster than light. It takes a shitload of time, but if you just like this game so much that you want to spend a lot of time doing a weird thing that nobody else does, why not? What you do is you keep probing and bookmarking the spots to see where the ship landed and even then, keep bookmarking while they're bouncing. They can't cloak immediately so you can see which direction they bounced to. Then you need to know the mass of the ship. Usually they won't fit higgs, but if they do, it slightly complicates things (as you need to find a ship that matches the higgsed mass or bring the same ship with higgs as well). You then bring a ship with similar mass, warp it to one of the bounce bookmarks and then @ 10km to the bookmark at the middle of the star. 10km because if you warp at zero, you'll most likely bounce to a completely different direction as you never land at zero on the bookmark. 
---
When you land from the bounce, you are on grid with the cloaked ship. You can now either anchor a Raitaru here to decloak them immediately, repeat the process a few times if you didn't decloak them or bring alts/friends to fly around in the area to try and decloak the ship.
---
Obviously, if the bookmark at the middle of a celestial object was patched out, none of this is possible. I haven't actively hunted people in a long time so I don't know.
---
There's no way you'd get enough DPS on a lml garmur to run a level 4
---
....gatecamping in Titans is a thing? Man Eve has changed since I last played.
---
¬Å
---
Who gives a shit about plex price. If you lower income for people playing the game, that's less money for ships.
---
The difference though is in effort. Before you only had a handful of automated scouts that would ping if someone showed up in a local 3 jumps away from you to safely go to ground.
---
Defenders could readily spot roams and gankers using local at a glance.
---
Now it requires 10x the effort to keep an area safe and augments exponentially in effort the wider the ground you want to keep safe.
---
If CCP is nerfing capitals then why need injectors?
---
Moon ore doesn't spawn in high sec.... You should find a null group.
---
Well, first rule is don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
And sorry for your losses but nullsec has always been about high risk/high reward, blackout is adjusting that back.
---
This changes nothing but the cloaky aspect, its still shit for people looking for fleet on fleet fights and makes "hunting" too safe
---
It's cool. You shouldn't apologize to a wannabe troll like me. That's the most consistent and fun isk I've seen. You may be able to get about same in exploration with a less than 100 million isk ship, but that's just on a good day and not even for four hours straight.
---
Including jumping warping doing the sites docking and repeating it's &gt;1bil/h at t5 in LP. I was making 700-800k lp per hour. I don't even chain them I just dock at a station with two agents reject every mission that's too far from both then do them and repeat. Of course this will only last till the social boosters expire, but even then after that you can just chain them but you need to dedicate 1-2 hrs for that.
---
Of course you have to wait for the opposing faction to start winning to cash in but that's a small price to pay for such safe money.
---
Shh you are hurting their narrative. Blackout is the greatest thing to happen to Null
---
With implants + drugs it‚Äôs probably possible to run some subset of possible spawns. Not consistently though and it‚Äôs a lot of risk
---
Tribute, vale, branch.
---
&gt; I'm not a fan of cloaky camping myself as that restrains krabs in the same kind of way people say the blackout does
---
in theory, yeah, but in practice most krabs are willing to krab with permanent cloaky eyes in local, trusting in their umbrella to save them or some similarly nonsense line of thinking
---
&gt;Yeah blue alts are good times but in my tz can be pretty conspicuous
---
your alts just aren't blue enough then
---
&gt;Local has always given far too much free intel. Its about time it was restricted.
---
i agree, but i think it's far too restricted. i think delayed member list and instant local count would probably be a nice compromise
---
Upvoted cause there was a cat, also think you should have mention CFC
---
Aw c'mon, we've been over this, it's super simple.
---
Sorry, why is that funny? It's a super carrier, is it not?
---
Wait a second how can a bot be in mumble and talking. This doesn't make any sense.
---
If you want a multi purpose so you dont have to reship just use a Stratios rather than a Gila. Same kind of drone damage gameplay but it can probe and covert cloak.
---
Same. I don't really understand why people are so upset there is more content in most of 0.0 now than ever before pre-blackout. I wasn't even around during the first week due to RL but Syndicate and surrounding areas have been way more active than anytime in the past 6 months.
---
Smoke some more dope, your not completely cooked yet. Almost but not quite.
---
Yeah, bombing is still a thing
---
&gt; elling a fantasy or not, I'm not sure. My experience this week is what I posted.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I want the blackout to work but I don't want power consolidated within the large blocks who will just steam roll ever small group that thinks they carved out their little piece of null because they are just going to get farmed and wrecked
---
Honestly, this is going to continue to be the case under the blackout. Particularly given that there is literally no counter to covert cynos and blops fleets at the moment *other than* fly a capital, and get your ass under the umbrella. 
---
No amount of d-scaning is going to save subcaps from the completely un-counterable.
---
look at kb from last sunday, there you see that kills stopped after 13:16 Evetime
---
Its ok because i use 2 diff accounts. 1 with gila and trained for cruisers and other for mining/exploration
---
First rule of eve: dont talk about eve
---
Second rule: trust nobody, because everyone will kill you, given the oppurtunity
---
Yea and then you graduate and go on with the rest of your life
---
People do that?
---
You can't they changed NSA, just make Sensorbooster not work on Carriers then and you have fixed this Problem.
---
Its reasonable because EvE got old and Devs never adapted.
---
Changed for the worse
---
I don't even know why I still play this
---
This. Wanted to start dissecting it but realised it was just filled with assumptions (bad ones) and straight out wrongs, and I like myself more than that.
---
I'd also suggest the Sisters of Eve Epic Arc before you do regular missions. It'll give you a ton of Isk and a bunch of free ships.
---
too many ppl are required to be enought, also, most of them dont want to do abyssal pvp at all, they are just there for the pve
---
Ohh? Please explain, how can i see the interior of my ships? ;)
---
Agreed. May it never end.
---
He's in goons
---
don't log off
---
They're experts. Also, Eve will die if they dont hold an annual tournament for them to properly circlejerk.
---
It certainly has a steep learning curve. But you have RL friends who play it. So stick with them and I'm sure they will show you the ropes. Starting this game with friends is honestly the best way. It's a very community oriented game so having a mini community that you're already a part of in RL helps out tremendously.
---
I would play with them for a long while until you feel confident you can do things on your own. Then backstab them in the game. Steal all their assets and have a laugh about it at the pub next evening.
---
You lost your ship?
---
Welcome to Eve!
---
As a newbie, I think that giving Rorquals the safety and yield they have now created a major shift in the game's economy where T1 mineraly became much more abundant, eventually leading to the extreme proliferation of supercapitals that we are seeing now. 
---
Watching let's plays and guides, I have always wondered why CCP would introduce skill injectors, knowing that they would only accelerate that shift in the meta by pushing people into both rorquals and supercapitals quicker and on a larger scale.
---
Absolutely, don't, don't even try it
---
Dude, its riddled with wrongs. Especially considering bots were using alpha accounts that didnt require any god damn PLEX.
---
You didnt get it, you buy PLEX of in-game market by ISK farmed by botting. You then sell the PLEX for $$$. Profit.
---
I'm not narrowing anything to fit my view, I said meaningful long term effect.  
---
When people bitch about small groups being hammered out by CCP they are either A) referring to small groups inability to take and hold sov regardless of which blocs are around them, or B) are fucking idiots who don't know shit about Eve and what a determined group of people can do.  
---
My point was that there is no game, or in the real life examples you provided, in which a small group can contest a large group which will result in meaningful long term effects. In Cloud Ring we let a handful of groups claim sov and do whatever they want, they can only do that because a larger bloc allows them. If I decided tomorrow that I wanted them gone, they could be evicted fully within the week and there's nothing those small groups could do to stop it.  
---
If you want to take a kind of equivalent example to your terrorist comments, if someone from a small group dreadbombs and kills a Titan in your space, yes your members will be concerned which will lead you to nuking the smaller group and getting rid of them - or at least as much as you can and there by eliminate the threat. Again there is nothing the smaller group can do and therefore even by killing a Titan have no meaningful long term effect on a bloc.  
---
Pizza Squad down in delve in 2014 (i think) caused havoc for the larger groups by basing out of NPC space and harassing very efficiently. But even they had no chance to carve out a home for themselves between the blocs, and they are now dead so no meaningful effect.  
---
The point I am trying to make is that for those people whinging about CCP killing small groups content or are pushing them out of null sec, there is nothing CCP can do that would allow smaller groups to content with blocs. Either players will allow smaller groups to grow, or they won't and regardless of what changes CCP could try to implement the many will always win against the few.
---
It's impossible. Suffer through it and one day you'll wake up and not remember ever not knowing how to play. There is no middle stage where you kinda.
---
Yay for sweeping game mechanic changes. We're changing how the game is played at a fundamental level because CCP was incapable of coming up with an effective counter to bots? We shouldn't be defending this.
---
That‚Äôs great to know, thanks! I‚Äôll definitely do that as soon as I get through the career agents. :)
---
Because trading ISK directly is traceble in the logs and RMT traders know it and dont want to get banned. They usually take PLEX, drop it somewhere in space as a cargo container and then the buyer picks it up. Something like this, which doestn show in logs that clearly. Thats why you sometimes see those ridiculous kills with PLEX in cargo on Jita.
---
They ran an open Corp, all recruits accepted, no questions asked. It would take no time at all for more alts to appease.
---
Burner blitzing is 250/h sustained. Only saying cause you said "can".
---
I've found the blackout to be the best thing to happen to the game since wormholes were added. It adds mystery and forces players to gather actual intelligence with scouting and observation.
---
It does indeed make 0.0 incredibly more dangerous but I feel like that is something 0.0 has been lacking since Dominion. I still regularly rat/mine/plex in null and lowsec for my isk and I don't really need to do anything extra I wasn't already doing in the past (check dscan often, have intel channels and standing fleets).
---
Made me laugh, good rp is good rp!
---
That was *also* before scrap metal processing got a massive nerf.
---
Since he is going "local was the best thing that could happen" its fairly a safe bet that he is pro local. And fairly a good bet he is grr NS. And he is wrong, its not reasonable facts and data. For instance, bots who are alpha accounts are driving PLEX prices up? Where the hell does that make sense?
---
How many gilas have you lost?
---
can you please post a fit for solo t3? 
---
Are you running darks ?
---
You sound attacked.
---
Yummmmm...fruit
---
Dude, why would they buy PLEX, they just straight up sell the isk which means botting and PLEX prices are not related except for the bots in supers and so on. But they are not in abundance, most are subcaps which dont require omega and therefore no PLEX.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what happened. Their structure getting reinforced was due to some third party Corp who didn‚Äôt like them for evicting the old owners.
---
I like the idea, but make the wrecks combat probe scannable only. That won't buff hunters in any way since you can just scan down the ship itself anyway, but would open up new opportunities to ninja loot/salvage etc. As someone else already  mentioned make them able to be filtered out so there won't be any probe scanned window fuckery thing. I really don't see any issues with that.
---
Reminder, that was a third party reinforcing because you evicted the old owner.
---
When you get to the JF level minmatar also uses the least fuel.
---
Heron is not little ! Heron is strong ! Heron is love !
---
I like that as well since this way there is no real new advantage for hunters, only opportunity to loot wreck.
---
and why is that a problem, if you want to pvp, and they want to pvp ?
---
I feel like this makes capitals even stronger, I would prefer for subcapitals to get a bit more love.
---
I use no 2fa. My pw is only 6 characters and it's the same password for all of my alts. Never once been "hacked" since 2004.  
---
I don't get how people are getting hacked all the time.
---
Yeah, you try bait on a black ops gang.
---
Fair shout, but again every mechanism you just listed doesn't exist in EVE.
---
One on a hard starving leshak spawn when i tried a new gila fitting with mwd and heavy missie launchers. One on leaving the final room by gankers. Might have been able to avoid the gank loss of i paid more attention.
---
nice!
---
SNS is the best part of the weekend. Hanging out with cool people, music, drinks and explosions. That's what it is all about
---
&gt; I think you have never heard about 3xA-Type arks.
---
&gt; They are also the cheapest one in usage as almost no one fly now archons and aeons.

Different a-type's buddy

How to bait 100 bombers without boson?
---
* No cooldown on fighter MWD. In fact, let's make it a permanently running module that never needs to cycle. 
---
* Any subcap that gets within 100km of a capital gets a 250000% Sig radius increase, and a 85% reduction in movement speed and agility.
---
* Cloaking now drains your capacitor completely, and lighting a cyno will instantly destroy a subcap and the freshly lit cyno.
---
* All capitals now have 98% resists across hull and armour, and minimum EHP of 69,000,069. 
---
* Capital guns or fighters now have a 50% chance to instantly destroy any subcap. If instant destruction doesn't occur, caps will dish out normal damage, but gain a tracking bonus per weapon cycle.
---
* Complaining about these changes will get you a permanent account and hardware ban. Your ingame items will be delivered to a capital pilot in need. You will be unable to use Eve online on your computer ever again. If you try, CCP will send an enforcer to your house to guarantee your cooperation. You will not try again.
---
I agree with your sentiment but an IRL government can absolutely not regulate to the cent how much money is put out. Yes most central banks buy and sell bonds to regulate the money supply. But money is also created by borrowing/lending which is determined by what people/businesses do. 
---
If what you said was the case, central banks would never miss inflation targets. Which happens very frequently.
---
share
---
Yes. 
---
CCP should have introduced a 15 - 25 second local _delay_ to shift SOME window of opportunity to hunters from the window of opportunity of krabbers to escape. 
---
Removing local was a dumb binary decision.
---
chemo
---
Yes. More supers indeed.
---
CCP should have introduced a 15 - 25 second local delay to shift SOME window of opportunity to hunters from the window of opportunity of krabbers to escape.
---
Yes, an excellent idea and what the Rorq should have been in the first place: a mobile mining base from which your crew could easily deploy.  
---
CCP started down this road and then gave up.  I was one of the fools who trained Cloning Facility Operation to V.
---
What do you hope we see?
---
buy the right book ^^
---
Was trying to see if there was ways to do minor changes to the game to allow sup caps to join into fights. Caps can carry large amounts of ships in their SMA's but the pilots need to come along.
---
1) because most hunters roam in small gangs and single ships are generally unlikely to survive.
---
2) not everyone wants to or has on demand access to small groups who can co-ordinate pve ops.  Secondly most pve sites arent really worth it isk wise in small groups
---
3) people are willing to adapt and will likely do so if a reasonable balance is applied to blackout.  At the moment it's a dscan clickfest that will eventually be fairly pointless because hunters will adapt to cloaky or dscan immune ships.
---
Wormholes typically take on newbros, often and regularly. Wingspan is huge for a wormhole Corp because of it. My Corp for example takes on newbros, we have a 900k sp character in Corp right now exploring away and asking so many questions about pvp.
---
Highsec corps also are flooded with new people all the time, the problem is they mine and do stupid boring missions.
---
Factional warfare is lowsec and constantly recruits new people as well.
---
You talk out of your ass.
---
Dude... Eve is not suffering deflation because of no local, you cant just use the price on PLEX during a time in which PLEX always goes down (summer) as a measure for the entire economy. Eve used to suffer deflation because things were getting cheaper but no local will lead to inflation, not deflation. Everything except for perhaps, and here is the keyword perhaps, PLEX will go up. Thats inflation, not deflation.
---
And how are you connecting alpha account bots to PLEX prices going up? Makes no sense because they dont need PLEX. And the fact that you think bots farm more than people is wtf at best. The only way that would happen is if most of NS was bots, which it really really really isnt. Just check the corps living in your bot paradises. And PLEX is highly interconnected with skill injectors/farms, far more than bots ever will be.
---
Im sorry, A for effort, but no.
---
No lol, that's not how this works. That's just selling Isk with extra, pointless, far easier to track steps.
---
Once the in game PLEX to Isk value reaches a certain point (the equilibrium) it becomes the exact same price, or even cheaper to just buy the PLEX from CCP and sell it for Isk in game. Hence, making it completely idiotic to buy PLEX with Isk and sell PLEX for money. Not for the person doing it, but for the person buying it - which is why they don't. 
---
The whole circle is a value loss as the only way PLEX is introduced to the game is at the price floor CCP sets. That's why most RMT sites still can't even sell Isk for less than you can buy it from CCP.
---
Yeah, I can't believe OP wants to nerf incursions when no one does them.
---
&gt; Highsec income is too high. Chaining Abyssals in highsec is too easy and too much income. Incursions are too easy and too much income. 
---
In certain things yes, I would like to see the suspect timer back for t4 and t5 abyssals.  That would help alot.  I also would like to see minerals return to their sec status separations.  I just disagree that the mineral spike recently is "large."  It's mostly just better, I think that minerals returning or some what returning back to their previous price points is good and currently we are no where near that.
---
Just don't get tackled ez
---
&gt;Nah.. abyssals,
---
&gt;All still rage inducingly boring as fuck
---
Abysalls are fun, fight me.
---
Mother doesn't allow you to leave the basement and interact with the "normies" very often, does she?
---
&gt;:(
---
Havent gone to either I dont think.
---
Breathe Bosb, breathe.
---
What's the full fit meant to.be?
---
Why would you even want to try? Sounds like it'd be super slow.
---
What do you mean by "imagine a world where Plex isn't a giffen good"
---
Yes!
---
3leet PvP player **vexorkiller_69** told me they would. He has 2 solo kills on his killboard, both of these being him killing ventures in his loki.
---
Why wouldn't I believe him??
---
...? He‚Äôs talking about the Frigates of Eve book.
---
Because putting that much effort into it means it no longer competes with other isk making methods that pay off better isk-to-effort-wise.
---
The only thing subcap drone ratting really has going for it is the low-effort involved.  vOv
---
Not true
---
will try, thanks
---
We had some wormholers decide to pop into our adjacent lowsec system and try to fuck about. So we dropped a super on them.
---
It can install a cloak
---
Of course you were downvoted. 
---
We only upvoted "le old Bois are coming back" and screenshots of a cursor hovering over the 2860 Plex that the poster was never going to buy, and other assorted bullshit.
---
you are
---
Sure, but I only quoted your part about the real world economy. 
---
Also, on ETC price (sub 300m), that was due in part to some russian silver mine owner who dumped I dunno how many tens of thousands in ETCs. At some point, prices were as low as 180m for 30 days ETC and 280m for 60 days ETC. He basically crashed the ETC market for 18 months on his own just so he could buy a shit ton of characters with ISK to give them to people.
---
The best part is generally these people don't even care when you say that because they are certain they are right and eve should only be there way. Conveniently missing that if everyone played their style there would be no one to hunt.
---
So why don't they just adapt into better income or use cheap myrms seems pretty chilly not to
---
I don't know about that. I was hunting explorers on an alt the other day and my very first target turned into a 3-way astero fight when another hunter also decloaked for the kill. Motherfuckers be hungry, y'know?
---
&gt;Ohh? Please explain, how can i see the interior of my ships? ;)
---
&gt;buy the right book ^
---
He asked how to see the interior of his ships. You know full well he can't do that. Now he's going to be searching for a skillbook that allows him to do that, all because you either didn't read his comment or because you wanted to be a dick (the assumption of the latter is what resulted in my last comment.)
---
Ye dont get tackled by cloaky ships. Sure mate.
---
Would you rather do the krabbing the you have to eventually do in no safety?
---
I don't get what your post is trying to say.
---
Not my experience. We've been getting quite a few fights out in pure blind. Some systems are regularly camped, but you're right about cloaky fuckers being less inclined to take anything that smells like bait, myself included.
---
yea I'm assuming its rats owning him, so drones and tank would help a bunch
---
&gt; Plex is a \[Giffen\] good. As the price rises, so does demand.
---
A Giffen good is one that people **consume** more of as it becomes more expensive. In other words, low plex prices -&gt; more alpha accounts. Higher plex prices (like now) -&gt; more people go to omega.
---
I don't see how this could be the case for plex. Please explain in more detail if you really think that this is what's happening.
---
I think what we're seeing, instead, is people buying up plex as a speculative investment. People think the price will continue to rise, so they buy it up and hold it, rather than holding value in their isk wallet.
---
If blackout is permanent, I imagine they will.  
---
For now, the bots can adapt by switching to highsec stuff, and the non-bot subcap ratters are probably just going to wait it out rather than putting the effort into a burner setup or whatever nonsense they decide to switch to.
---
That said, cheap myrms do seem like good filler, especially if your group reimburses them to make it a no-brainer.
---
tl:dr?  
---
"Hellow im shitty staingay and i dont want nullsec because i life in hisec - delete nullsec. thanks"
---
I AM BREATHING
---
I still argue that CCP shutting down Somer Blink is what started the ball rolling on rapid inflation of PLEX prices. I only have anecdotal evidence, but even just among the small group of people I was playing with at the time, it generated a lot of PLEX purchases, so I can only imagine how it was on a larger scale. It was only after it was shut down that PLEX prices started getting really out of control, as presumably there was less being sold on the market.
---
There's an actual book to see the interiors? Huh.... F me...
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/frigates-of-eve-online-the-cross-sections-now-available
---
Im not in horde. I know horde s former policy and i hope the meta shifts for encouraging stuff like the old horde. Would be good balance between interests.
---
Although i did quite a bit of pvp, i enjoy  corporate roles more. All my eve career was built  bringing small independent groups in sov null. Not that i am great either. 
---
You can see why i dont like the blackout, which leads to everyday calls on discord with stuff like: hey why dont we fold into horde?
---
Apparently it would be....
---
That is the highest paying method that involves absolutely no risk of PvP. Start to add other players into the picture and your other methods start to make sense. Abyssal sites are far to easy once you have the right build.
---
Thank you for making a home where anyone that wants to feel wanted need only get involved. I see so many people screech the big null blocs will make you a number and your time there will be hollow. 
---
It's just not. I wish everyone feels as complete and proud in their respective corps. Sadly, I know that is unlikely at best.
---
Nice save, what tier was this?
---
So then why was such a drastic nerf needed for nullsec if there were better sources of income in safer space?
---
I also think it makes it exponentially harder for anyone without a capital to grind towards their sub. 
---
Perhaps it's what CCP wanted, but I was happy when I first moved to null, ground for a while in a (non afk) VNI then a Rattle, and a portion of my ratting income went towards Plexing my account.
---
This realistically isn't an option now. It's alligned carrier or nothing, while giving myself RSI from spamming d-scan while managing my fighters. I'm genuinely enjoying running abyssals in high sec more than most null activities.
---
That's how the Sith tend to operate too. Train your apprentice to be good enough to kill you one day.
---
Amarr freighter when you want to role play a rebel transport.
---
Objectively, blackout is good for economic.
---
Blackout reduced player activity in null (not bots only). Check ozone on yours jg.
---
CCP treats headache by guillotine, lol
---
Rebalance sov (remove TCU for example), reduce nodes, increase max value of incoming damage to citadels (reduce time to kill it), remove armor RF on medium citadels (as navigation structures), bump T1 BS, add jump drive to marauders, reduce DPS from supercarriers to subacp more, and the most basic - war with bots and severe punishment (ban all accounts, for example) to players, which are botting - IT ALL COMPLICATED REEEEEEEE. We removed local.
---
So it really doesn't sound THAT risky if you can run two at the same time and watch netflix and you only lost one because you tried a different fit (so it doesn't really count) and the other to gankers that you could have avoided (so again doesn't really count). 
---
Sounds pretty safe to me. I mean I get the initial investment is high, but it seems the risk isn't as high as you make it sound and it provides a sizeable income that is fairly stable (maybe not the highest you can get, but stable and decent is a great feature).
---
If it's 110 degrees its surely worth every penny.
---
Or hryvnia whatever you guys use over there
---
Lol. Take your upvote!
---
Rookie chat is good for first days, you then can lookup chat groups who focus on specific playstyles for a more focused experience.
---
One thing is different with isks from reality : people, even active, are hoarding it. Real money is rarely inactive, as banks are using it or it's invested somewhere. In video games, some of it is invested, but most is sleeping as war treasury to be used in the future. But as most players are rather efficient in their economy, most of their isks is simply sleeping.
---
This, IMO, account for a lot in the isk economy.
---
They are undocking, getting plenty of content.
---
&gt;A lot of people that complain about it really just want easy killmails handed to them
---
Yup. That's why dropping 6 Loki's on a lone vexor is fine, but a couple of caps drop on them on the way home and caps need nerfing.
---
They just hate it when other people do to them what they enjoy doing to others.
---
https://i.imgur.com/r3tW3nC.jpg

It doesn‚Äôt make people move, people just do different types of sites or just suck it up and wait. It‚Äôs a pain/dangerous gating around and jumping around a costs fuel that racks up. If you want people to spread out, then you would need to nerf the amount of sites in a system. I am against this because honestly you fucking eleet pvp hunters can suck my home defense dick, no kills for you. But in a less biased view, I believe that would be how to achieve what you are going for.
---
thats 90% of the mentality of r/EVE right there....
---
You ever tried to be active bait for 20 hours for when the cloak dropper decided to quit being afk?
---
How about now without local.  Oh and convince your group to sit and wait with you to kill the 100mil in ships.
---
I hope they make t4 and t5s turn you suspect again. That would be awesome.
---
I totally am down with thirding the eve Uni suggestion. Those guys bring content and it's fun. I've run into one of their frig gangs and they committed to a fight. Mad respect for that.
---
Try leaving the largest group in the game and see if you still feel the same way.
---
You lost me at "any region where activity dropped is related to bots".
---
It dosent seem that difficult to write the bot that uses scanner probes instead of local.
---
I rejoined eve and got into Horde. I have a blast having fleetpings every couple hours
---
Not from the uk but this is the kind of shop you want if you have no clue how to build your own rig. Never buy the shit from big brands its a scam.
---
no worries, lemme login
---
PVP my ass, this blackout has shown the loudest ‚Äúcontent seeking‚Äù pvpers are more risk averse than any krab or carebear.  You want them to get back in space while remaining easy to kill and engage on I get that.
---
It‚Äôs whining like that that got the blackout, and you‚Äôre already seeing content dry up because of it.  You want more ease of access into killing pve players...?
---
The sheet above is a bit weird about the numbers. Are you up to make up something? Such a narrow date net in your table, that it miss some important price moves around may 2019. So, PLEX is on decline since may and at the moment the blackout didn't really impact the general dynamic of things. Also, you pick a starting date - this is a time of PLEX global price gone wildly down. Just before the World War Bee - when Lenny started to gather isks for the goon bashing. I beleive, you, maybe unwillingly, made a bad research.
---
TLDR: the sheet above is just a karmawhorus endeavor to appease Eve's everyday agenda of "too high PLEX price" and "botting is bad/CCP is good". The analysis is irrelevant.
---
Just rat in something that can be aligned with stabs
---
I m titan / cap player i wont use it in the blackout for pve for sure. Yeah i dont live under an umbrella.
---
It's not that hard to fit stabs lmao
---
Wife and I are leaving soon for a trip to Turks and Caicos, Half Moon Cay and Freeport. Vacation + offhand location scouting. Although I think we have both changed our minds to looking at Exuma for property.
---
I don't think it would be only krabs leaving if CCP deleted capitals over night.
---
&gt; TF2 Keys are like 34 ref a pop.
---
Holy shit they were like 3 back when I played lmao
---
Married to a teacher. Can relate.
---
I'll probably fly cheap enough to be okay with dying solo. If I get too wrecked too frequently, I'll probably follow your advice and join a w-space corp that's more PVE friendly. But for now, I'm happy plodding along on my own. Thanks for the perspective though!
---
Not a counterargument. In fact, assuming nothing changed from before and they remained where they were, concurrent logins continue to dwindle, as they had been for years. Lots of PvE players want to talk about the inconvenient truth - but they can't understand why CCP would make dramatic changes with their highest earning product becoming less popular by the month.  
---
Blackout isn't the answer alone, but maintaining stagnation for the sake of status quo is an even worse answer.
---
My reply: told you so.
---
&gt;nullsec has always been about high risk/high reward, blackout is adjusting that back.
---
Where is the high reward currently?
---
The ring is the warp drive, not the cloak :)
---
I would support falcon‚Äôs idea of going all the way banning supers from anoms and making them ineffective against subcaps. Supers should be dedicated anti capital ships.
---
This would be great actually.
---
Seconding this. You don't have to be in KF to be with us. Pop on into the KF Lobby and hang out any time.
---
Nope, These things have been abused to a almost game breaking degree. And its not a playstyle thing.
---
Rorqs have completely broken the mat balance. Inflation is way worse than it seems. Using Plex as measure of the value of isk(your dollars/euros/pounds will still presumably hold the same/similar value to you): A super hull use to cost 30b at a time where a plex was 500m-600m isk... Super hulls are now 10b and plex is 2b.
---
That puts the relative cost at 60 plex vs 5 plex. The value of isk has crashed.
---
Cap proliferation has gone crazy. The subcap game is reasonably well balanced. But caps are way overpowered. The fact that caps can fight subs unassisted is insane. Caps have been broken for years.
---
The afk VNI/Gilas: They suck to fly, they suck to hunt;they, by design don't require much input, its essentially botting implemented by CCP. Its bad game design. Get rid of drone auto aggression. 
---
The intel networks aren't a playstyle they're a tool. And they're game breaking dude. Interactions in space is the core of EvE.
---
What? There aren't random groups of 100 bombers sitting on a bridge almost anywhere. Generally, a couple of guys is the most you'll have to worry about, and even little groups can react to that if they live in a small area. Fit tackle and neuts to your Myrm or Domi, insure, and make sure you get on as many killmails as you can as your friends arrive - you'll be the first to pop.
---
Im posting you support that I agree with both of you. I love blackout.
---
Ruined supply chain runs. Defend your pipe. Get your shit in. Get your shit out.
---
I wouldn t rush into corp. First learn the ui and decide what to do. Then join a corp that does that.
---
Totally wrong.
---
I was rolling nulls. Wherever I came out wasn't great. idk.
---
Also battle badger.
---
What is fun for some people is not for others. Dropping a dread on a super carrier to kill it and then dock up for the night, patting each other on the back for one less super is not fun for me. It's just ganking. 
---
What is fun is roaming subcaps. Even pre blackout, this was kind of dead. You could roam in subcaps, go 20 jumps and either find dead space, bots that just warped away automatically, and then get dropped on by the nearest super. 
---
There are multiple things wrong. The lack of good hunting targets has been a problem. When eve online became supers online (read when rorquals got buffed) , traditional roaming died. There was no incentive to continue using subcaps if all you wanted was a killmark or to defend the other people krabbing. 
---
When the fighter change happened and supers had near perfect tracking with LR fighters, the amount of isk being generated sky rocketed. When haw weapons were introduced and then bosons, it inflated even more. There was also no reason to not use the biggest ships in the game to kill anything that moved through your region. Null blocs took this to the extreme and even newbie alliances like brave are now catching up to the supercap umbrella strategy (grats to them btw). 
---
It doesn't mean that play style is invalid, actually the opposite. It's being encouraged by continuing changes. With the blackout, super umbrellas have become the only defense for alliances that want to pve. What it does mean is that now the roaming gang is presented with even deader space as has been pointed out, and is also having to go deeper into supercap umbrellas. 
---
With no incentive to use subcap ships, more and more people are just grinding to that first rorq or that first super. No in betweens. The large null blocs are now continuously upshipping and encouraging two to three titans in a hangar. If you want more people spread out and better targets, roll back the changes that made supers the end all PvP and pve ship. Make  it so that there are subcap ships that are better at pve, and not 130 Mill super ticks good, that's another detriment to the game, but that they are better at it than a super or Titan.
---
Side note. Better pve content that pays out good risk vs reward is needed. Also activities that are not mind numbing or easily botted. At least not easily botted and high reward. Content that the abyss was supposed to full fill, but has now been so farmed and does not have consistent red loot to make it worth it. The fix for abyss is that each can in each room has a minimum amount of red loot, similar to what sleeper sites in wormholes have. Each t5 site should have at least x amount that is the highest and is scaled down in a manner that makes sense.
---
I talked to the cat. I assure you she likes potatoes. She wasn't very nice about it tho.
---
Good, continue to stick your head in the sand if you 'steadfastly believe' people won't, by in large, stick to high sec as the risk of null sec space increases. This is the problem with economics generally--and capitalist economics specifically--seeing human behavior as driven by individual humans acting in a self-interested way, such that they always operate with perfect information like some disembodied nexus of rationality.

The truth is, people tend to be risk averse, and also respond to things for emotive reasons. Loosing shit all the time when you are just trying to earn money sucks, and even if you 'expect' people to pull out their calculators and figure profit margins in both high sec and null, which they won't, they are not going to 'choose' the thing that annoys the shit out of them and makes them feel bad because the isk per hour is a little better.
---
I read your post as a narrator for some animal docu channel "the solo krab grazes the field, not aware that he is about to get eaten". 
---
This wont work because you and many others are missing a key aspect, the human. People are not staying docked just because of higher risk, they are doing it because their package has been broken. When you decide to live somewhere in Eve you do it based on information regarding the setup, you often know what youre getting into. Its a package.
---
No local breaks that package for someone like me who PvEs not because I need the isk but simply because I find it relaxing. If Im going to get stressed by doing something that I usually do to relax then... You see the issue. Thats why nerfs work but changing core mechanics dont. It would be like instating local in WHs or removing CONCORD from HS, you would break the package and cause an imbalance. Worst case people might find that Eve is no longer a game for them and just move on.
---
TL:DR Stop getting stuck in risk/reward, krabbers/pvpers, risk adverse/total morons and start looking at people and why they do certain things. If you dont understand the why then you cant fix it.
---
No, but that's a good option. I'm hunting clone soldiers in lowsec.
---
I get nothing from baiting hunters. It's not worth my time.
---
I can make better isk else where in eve, now.
---
You could make more by ganking abyssal hunters I'd say. We got one on a roam the other day (why he was doing it in null I don't know) and pulled 1.2 bil from his fit. 
---
If we tornado ganked in highsec we could definitely run profitable ganking near that amount in 24 hours.
---
Well the black out has not done what people hoped for in Delve. All it has promoted is people shoring up into supers and titans and mining in more rorquals for the safety of it. 
---
I will say though, it makes baiting retards/hunters even easier because they can‚Äôt see the cloaked titans on gate or the cyno alts next to that little freighter you were going for. We baited Marshy 3 times in a row to dread bomb supers that we had traps ready on. All the black out has done is make delve stronger and an even scarier place to go.
---
On other side entry into a system requires the usage of a jumpgate. These jump gates are maintained by CONCORD I suppose. The record of who uses those gates would be public knowledge and logged into a public database. Since EVE takes place in a time period were interstellar travel is commonplace, capsuleers are essentially immortal and FTL communication is a given, the idea that a ships AI could constantly monitor CONCORD logs to see who is using a jumpgate is not a stretch of the imagination.
---
On a PvE ship? You know how stabs work? Or your suggestion is that everyone should sit in drone boats, literally the same thing thats been complained about for so long.
---
The ecosystem still needs to adapt. First the sheeps die to the wolves. Then the wolves starves and their population decrease. The sheeps can return to the fields. The wolves then, but in far lower numbers. Unless the wolves extinct their preys whole and all die after that.
---
In eve terms the future will be determined by how the hunters will adapt to their starvation.
---
But the biggest problem is capital farming and cap-umbrella for now. They are immune to gangs.  It shouldn't be.
---
We call that Miniluv
---
Thanks, yeah, I've considered getting a handful of scanner alts to help with the solo play.  
---
Structure might come after I'm dualboxing RR nestors :P
---
Yes and no.
---
The "EVE IS THE MOST COMPLEX THING EVER!!!" meme is vastly overblown. However, on the other hand your starting experience is largely dictated by two things: Which corp you join and skill training timers.
---
Joining a good corp is really important. You're gonna want one that is active and has pretty regular fleets in your TZ, has a community that supports new players and idealy has a SRP thing set up. Be very careful about joining a wormhole corp starting out, YES it can be done and a basic 1-2 week trained Praxis fit will let you do C3's but it's still very iffy. WH fun is one of the things where the higher your skills are trained the more you can get out it, more than anywhere else in the game.
---
Second, skill training timers for core V's and various other basic things are the bane of new players, and I'm convinced are responsible for most new people quitting. You can't really do anything other than grit your teeth and bear it while new, and imo the early game skill experience needs some overhauls.
---
Basing the risks solely on the trackrecord of a single guy doing aprox 25 hours of abby is quiete a stretch i believe. 
---
I believe the frightening thing about abby risks are that they are largely out of your control. 
---
1. Network problems - either ccp side or isp or power outage
---
2. Hardly any protection from suicide gankers. 
---
3. Bad spawn --&gt; you die
---
On the other hand, why dont abby sites earn more? Probably cause they are popular enough
---
It‚Äôs called a super and plenty of people are using it. Prepare to see more of it.
---
Why shouldn't it be though? I hate it as much as anyone but I believe it's how it should be. Its very easy to keep yourself away from their reach, just don't go messing up their house.
---
Oh wingspan has +10k chars? Didnt know what.
---
Oh really, you have 1 whole newbie. Praise the lord, Eve is saved. 
---
Hahahhhahahahahhaha omg. Dude, youre fking hilarious. The 2 safest shiptypes are hurting. Wow dude, like woooow.
---
In a vacuum yes, but deflation can also be triggered by sheer oversupply which we have had occur in many products in game.  Currently I am not sure which is being more affected by the blackout, products produced or direct isk faucets via ratting.  I will hazard a guess to say its ratting and if that is the case that means less isk going into the economy and more products.  So may see general deflation because of both less isk and larger oversupply.  Although recently I have seen mineral prices rise up abit so this guess doesnt seem correct.
---
As a veteran. Lets get something make boom.
---
If you are staying T1, gallente does the job
---
If you are looking beyond, you need to look at T2 versions and freighter/jump
---
Each side has their boons depending on how you want to use the ships. However more low slots means more propulsion options, more mid slots really doesn't help the ships very much overall.
---
You're part of a huge coalition, that helps a lot. we are barely 10-15 active during peak hours, doesnt change anything for us. Wait for alliance / coaltion pings to undock, or hunt in comms.
---
Prepare to fail. I don't mean that to scare you away or anything. Just know that you won't be hot shit right out of the gate. You will lose ships, and it will suck.
---
Just remember to learn from your mistakes. If you have a few friends to show you the ropes, you have a pretty good start. They should be able to tell you how to avoid a lot of the rookie mistakes.
---
There is risk of PvP, infact you are somewhat of a sitting duck.
---
I used to do trading. Made me about 1b/h, with absolutetly zero risk.
---
1. There are more plex-subbed bots than you think obviously, just decreases profit a little bit but you do not need am VMware Farm to do it.
---
2. Why is "grr local" automatically "grr nullsec"? 
---
Since nullsec meta is what it was until blackout, an afk-multiboxed no-content-wasteland, particularly botted to avoid any non-consensual (core principle of this game per definition) player interaction, I have left Nullsec towards Lowsec. Since blackout me and a lot of people I know have dusted off their old Nullsec-Roaming-Hubs and are going to Nullsec every day. We love Nullsec ... we would never say "grr nullsec". The only thing we say is "grr effortles hisec afk-krabbing in nullsec". Thats a huge difference
---
yes
---
Taperium Panfam or frat of they live until august
---
Because the risk disappear. Even in highsec there is more risk because of ganks. Why should you be safe farming in nullsec where it earns the most?
---
The most valuable relics are in null or wormholes. C1-C2, C3 wormholes can have the same relic sites as null. They need a pirate name in them to be a relic with no rats that will kill you. Players can always kill you. Handy chart to show you.
---
https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/409/safety-can-i-warp-to-this-site
---
You can use your cheap heron to go lots of places and hack relic sites. To get the hardest one in null you need a sensor strength of 72-73 and you will have to resize the probes manually. Much easier in wormholes for some reason, lot easier.
---
You can use the Thera wormhole to get from point A to point B and back quickly with limited jumps. Signal Cartel corp updates all the connections. Go to null and back quickly. One can looted out of a relic will pay for many of your herons. So if you lose one not a big deal. Keep on trucking.
---
http://www.eve-scout.com/thera/map/
---
It just takes time to learn. It can be as hardcore or as casual as you want it to be. Everyone always spouts off about YOU CONSENT TO PVP WHEN YOU UNDOCK!!!! and all other other memes that actually do nothing but keep new players away but it is really not THAT bad. The only real thing you can lose is ISK, and ISK is easy to make.
---
A lot of people will tell you that the ONLY things you should be doing are either A - PVP, or B - Activities that support PVP. You can ignore that and do whatever you want. Just make sure that whenever you decide you want to try something you look at the Wiki created by EVE University. 
---
Most in game chat channels are useless. All of the answers to your questions will either be to buy some ship you can't afford or to move to null sec.
---
I mean Ultima Online was far more brutal than eve.
---
Most of the people I corps I fly with are not ratting at all and there's a big push to running abyssals in highsec with alliance fits for each tier. It's pretty funny because earlier I was saying null is dead and I turn around and my own alliance is pushing its players away from ratting, to putting a clone in highsec to run abyssals. Jesus christ
---
&gt;1. Dropping titans in a response fleet is pretty dumb, because there's always a risk of a double escalation. Supercarriers are far better value. 
---
lol?  That doesnt seem to be the case with regards to what people are dropping atm.  Maybe they're just doing it for lols but yeah...
---
&gt;2.  HAWs on titans are pretty awful now. The don't have the range for something that can't move once committed to the field, and their DPS has been neutered hard. Again, you're better off dropping a supercarrier 
---
If they are awful then theres no reason not to remove them.
---
&gt;3. Even without support fighters, a supercarrier group can still force any subcapital fleet off grid, given sufficient numbers. They just won't kill very much. 
---
I mean anything in sufficient numbers can force anything off the field but I do not believe that they would straight out force titans to leave grid if the opposing force had sufficient numbers as well.  That being said I do not believe getting rid of support fighters is the answer and I think they add variation to the game.
---
&gt;4. A good standing fleet isn't relying on supercarrier fighters for tackle, because frankly, sirens are borderline garbage and unreliable as hell. You bridge in subcapital tackle to hold down the targets for the supercarriers to mulch. 
---
Agree
---
&gt;5. FAX's exist 
---
Yes, I do think Titans need a nerf in EHP or some other ship or tool needs to be introduced to help smaller groups deal with them.  Faxes getting nerfed helped but they are still really powerful, I think that they should be nerfed with regards to repping subcaps though, not caps personally.
---
I agree with your overall point but some of your subpoints no.
---
The newbies I've talked always in the past assumed local was where people talked. That didn't last long of course.
---
A ton of people are using the same login and password for every services they use online.You just need one database leak and they are all fucked.
---
&gt;Never once been "hacked" since 2004.
---
You are lucky, your precautions are weak making you vulnerable, you just didn't get caught yet.
---
Speaking of tables with numbers, I'd be really interested in seeing ratting volumes by hour by region. Purely anecdotal, but in my neighborhood, Dek-Branch are roughly as active in AUTZ-CNTZ as before but don't have the around-the-clock activity that those regions had pre-blackout. I'm curious to see whether other regions have seen comparable time zone compression, but don't really know how to grab that data.
---
useful thanks!
---
I've always wondered if plex should be used for a reduced rw price monthly sub instead of no rw cost.  
---
I also wonder how lower plex prices (if this happens) would effect pvpers who plex for capital.
---
If you want to rat that bad which i sure wouldn't, use a domi with neuts scram web and mjd.
---
til panfam, one of the top 2 most massive blobs in eve is a medium sized coalition. 
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Pandemic_Horde
---
At the end of each room you have the option to go to the PvP room or not. You do not have to do so. As for market trading that is also considered PvP.
---
Hey, that's great to hear! XD
---
Frat is about as blue to Panfam as test is to the imp.
---
https://sov.space/
---
it isn't
---
this is worse
---
If CCP want to really fix things they need real changes, don't allow caps in anoms, get rid of rorquals. Want to really fix the game? Get rid of skill injectors and potentially limit the use of plex.
---
Is the rorq/cap changes unfair because people have been doing it for so long? Yes, but CCP fucked up and made stupid decisions. At some point you have to stop. The current changes will only have people consolidate more. 
---
Even if, and big if, people moved into the open space that no one cares about anymore they will under no circumstances be able to match the blocs running super umbrellas running rorqs and supers. As a krab why join and make 10% of the isk you could in one of the 2/3 blocs?
---
This made me chuckle.
---
Im talking about suicide gankers after leaving the final room.
---
Back to drone-loot?
---
I'm all in
---
Well, for 2) at least 2 accounts are needed. Doubling up on sub fees is IMHO what will keep a large portion of more "casual" players away from that option. I expect 4) to end up as the option chosen more frequently.
---
&lt;3 gud post, gud attitude ... keep having fun guys
---
Make a good safe in Jita, insta undock and insta dock.
---
I love the idea that a rorqual destroys 10 for every 1 mined, fast wasteful mining.
---
Barges become the slower but more efficient ships.
---
Weird, that's the exact opposite of what I've experienced so far in the game.
---
When you play more pvp on r/eve than eve itself lol
---
When you leave the final room, you have zero speed. You can then get ganked. Are you even familiar with abbysals?
---
Would you explain the downside of blackout for PvP please? I guess I am to stupid to get it ...
---
I honestly think that each person parroting what that guy is saying, is not or has not tried to do any pve activity in black out. That, or not being honest with the balance of the scales. I've done some blops in this black out, also I have been watching our Blops channel. They are mega dunks and as the time has passed and opportunities have thinned.. I have seen KM of a ratting subcap with 20-25 blops on it. No one with a straight face can tell me that a subcap is going to have any chance against what is out there hunting right now.
---
Indeed. This doesn't work for a lot of reasons but asking for people to do this is just basically begging for handicapped fights in your favor :| Killing pvers is fun, but don't confuse it for real fights, it doesn't really make you a pvper anymore then f1 monkeying does ;p
---
I make more passively PvPing the market in highsec with only a few hundred bil currently invested during the absolute minimum time im willing to put into making isk. Which is max 30 mins. Any longer is unacceptable and unplayable 
---
Using my isk to bring in more isk, and comes with zero risk and near zero effort.
---
Shut up noob. Go away! The bitter-vets are talking.
---
Thats a good option, as you can do it in PvP-Fits and be ready for anything, used to do it in a 10MN Confessor, worked well.
---
They are panfam
---
That‚Äôs what people are doing hence eve dying..
---
Test is blue with imperium. Frat is blue to panfam.
---
I freely admit I have enjoyed blackout too, I just don‚Äôt see it working long term
---
Because they can‚Äôt do it afk
---
Are you sure your are using the correct terminology here? Coalitions exist solely within the metasphere of the game. They exist solely within the the collective minds of the people playing. There is no in-game list of that.
---
About as* .. not in game but where it matters politically.
---
Also, skip blood raider relics. They are worthless
---
We're not going to just siphon isk out of people's pockets you're right, but that doesn't mean CCP can't and shouldn't adjust ISK sinks.  The universe is infinitely fungible, they could add a tax to all stargates if they wanted to.  Just because people got rich from the current mechanics doesn't mean we shouldn't make it harder to get richer and make it hard for more rich people to crop up.
---
Your attitude is basically "this is eve now, just accept it."  The reason eve is the way it is, is because of the changes made to it.  We can revert faucet changes or we can add new sinks.  It's delusional to think this can't be fixed.
---
The l33t ‚Äúhunters‚Äù think blackout will give them even easier kills because apparently local makes it too hard for them. Now they can‚Äôt even hunt anything at all except being greeted by a super counter drop. Lmao
---
Thanks so much! Y'all rock
---
i just want to give a big shoutout to cheetah kouvo for being the first to kill me.
---
like any good eve citizen, cheetah understood that killing newbies is the first step to getting them past the fear of death...and that giving them a little money afterwards is a very good second step. thank you, cheetah, for teaching with your proteus that death is surmountable and risk is real. your good lesson will not be forgotten.
---
~(but i will get you back)
---
Good idea butt I'd go a slightly different route.
---
First of all: 
---
Go into your launcher, click the E in the top right and click "Shared Cache". Click Verify and wait for it to finish. then check if the issue still persists.
---
If it does then start Loglite (Can also be found in the launcher menu in the top right) and with Loglite running reproduce the issue.
---
Then save the file and create a bug report on http://bugs.eveonline.com and attach the loglite file to the bug report and explain your issue.
---
@CCP: Hire me plx
---
What about CCP adjusting anoms so they escalate to the amount of people up to a max number  ? Reducing total available sites so and some other changes so it can't be exploitet
---
I mean, Minmatar is great for on-grid industry.
---
Skill extractors killed EVE
---
Game fucked me out of a $1.5B fit. had no control and it took my ship to the boundary and killed me. couldn't do anything. Put in a ticket and CCP said No. So I haven't touched an abyssal since. Too much risk to trust the amateurs at CCP. Good ISK? sure. Odds you're gonna get fucked? 95%+
---
It was never perfect intel. It was like the African Savannah. Good alert masses of antelope can keep eye out for the sneaky clever lions. Weak and stupid get culled.
---
Small point in your overall post, but plex isn't a giffon good. A giffon good is one that people consume more of as price increases, and less of as price decreases. While it is true plex consumption has increased as the price went up, the opposite would have to be true to be a giffon good.  While I don't have the exact data, plex sales do not decrease as their price decreases. It would be more accurate to describe plex as price inelastic good, similar to something like medicine. Regardless of how much it's price increases, people will still buy it because they need it
---
Hey, I've done it... Twice. Maybe three times.
---
A goon muttering the words "hunting" too safe lol. 
---
You don't think mining and ratting has been too safe in delve? the Irony
---
Don't really need paragraphs, blackout either works financially for CCP or it doesn't. That's what decides the games fate. Not feelings or any other logic.
---
We can talk about how great it is for a game of 5 people if people don't find themselves in love with it or indifferent.
---
I wouldn't mind capitals to get nerfed to shit when it comes to their combat strength. They should be force multipliers operating mostly on strategic and sometimes on tactical level, not scary death machines.
---
I.e. Titans on their own should be vulnerable even in numbers. Titans with subcap backup should make that backup fucking terrifying.
---
...no. that doesn't clarify anything.
---
Well, other than the passive shield sigil (500+ hp/s passive Regen)
---
Also, Eve uni has an entire wiki to help. If you run across something you don't know, try googling eve University: thing you want to know. They are also a corp dedicated to helping brand newbros get into the game if you want to join them. It's a bit more like classes but it's a good solid group.
---
ke$ha is a pretty cool mascot.  i like to worship my alliance's mascot too.  julianus soter is really cool.  nobody says, "all pilots prepare for combat" nearly as well.  i wonder if ke$ha ever tells dirt'n'glitter to prepare for combat too.  that would be cool.  maybe ke$ha can play eve too and be like julianus soter.  i think dirt'n'glitter would like that. i also heard that they are recruiting.  someone should tell ke$ha.
---
I said fastest cloaked speed.   
---
Lowers the likelihood of getting decloaked in a bubble.
---
That's why it requires more people.
---
Otherwise there is too low of a chance of papers finding opponents
---
Its almost like im looking at the whole picture and not just delve.. i know! Shock!
---
I only PvP 
---
thanks to the blackout my options have gone from being able to form a small group of subcaps to chase "hunters" (read gankers) and force a fight to tackling them and lighting a cyno to gank them. Thats not fun but go ahead and ignore the bigger picture because grr gons
---
&gt; Your attitude is basically "this is eve now, just accept it."
---
Wat? Reading comprehension plz. 
---
My position seems to detailed, so lets explain:
---
I totally disagree with all Changes of 2017 (Citadel/Lifeblood). They are the reason for:
---
1. safe travelling without maintenance/fueling (fucked hunters)
---
2. Keepstar-Chains enabling Umbrella-Mechanics (fucked hunters, made the most rewarding single-acc-pve also the least risky one)
---
3. Lifeblood-Patch made Rorqals an economical "Frankensteins Monster" as they were made nearly limitless stackable in Multiboxes that needed just a few clicks per hour --&gt; further exponentially taking PvE-Players away from the rest ... and the patch fucked Hunters from Lowsec, that lived of Moons ....
---
All this is bad, and I would like it to never have happened. But it happened and with that some things are out there (like a few thousand Titans) that would be the "forever-win-button" if you just remove the mechanics that led to that blob, and not the blob itself.
---
because no-local only affected nullsec and nothing else, pretty strong common sense
---
This is exactly as predicted. Protection for money making (rat or mine) needs numbers. That means people. That means people congregate. With not enough people in Eve that means few tight umbrella systems. 
---
I thought CCP wanted to utilize the vast swathes of unused systems in null. They did, now they're going back to centralised operations again.
---
The predictable "yey" from shortsighted pvp roamers has come to fruition. An initial cull, and quick learning that you need lot's of people online to protect you enough to make the risk worth the reward. Result, dock up and logoff as there's not enough playerbase to allow that yet. And this reduces it further.
---
I never really bother with warp core stabs tbh, most of my hauling is either restocking my lowsec holiday home or taking shit to/from WH space and I scout myself on an alt in both cases. All about the align time to speed it up as much as possible lol.
---
A lot of Curse systems are 160+ systems range into deep ratting / mining areas.
---
As a rule of thumb I dislike extracting skills.
---

---
@joe buddan
---
Exactly
---
Noted, thank you!
---
Sleeper caches in a heron?
---
The summer drop was already in play when blackout started... this is pure blackout. Part protest, part reality.
---
got my first killmark on a rorqual of mine and that was neato burrito
---
All it did was multiply the super-umbrella by forcing every bloc to reinforce and bring more attention to detail making them even more efficient and cohesive. LOL!
---
I'd say its not 'hard' per say.  Eve has a few issues that make it difficult to hook new players.  1) its not a theme park.  There is not a 'this is for noobs, then you ride this medium ride, then you ride this end game e-ticket'.  Eve is now more like the Santa Cruze beach board walk.  In that when you arrive it is a bit overwhelming.  Do you wan tto go on the rides? play the carny games? eat food? go build a sand castle on the beach? go swimming? chat with that group of hot guys/girls there?  etc.  You have a lot of choices, a lot of things to try, and each has there own theme park built in in various levels.  Or you cna say 'F*ck that!' and go crazy wrecking everyone elses stuff.  
---
2) Witht he above, you get a ton of information really fast, and its hard to process.  
---
3) Eve is dark and full of terrors, most of them are the other players.
---
In my 15 year sin eve, my advice to new players is usually the same.  Find what you love to do in other games here and do it.  If you liked killing npc's in wow or other games, then focus on that in eve and ignore the other aspects, at least when you start.  Like to mine? do that.  Buoild crap? do that.  PVP? do that.  Run raids and missons? do that.
---
This was essentually what i did.  Mining hooked me in eve caus ei enjoye dit in Earth and Beyond.  And then it led me to start my own corp, become a pirate hunter, start an alliance, dj for eve radio, help IAC evict FiX form the south, owned my own systems.  Get kicke dout by BoB, move to Wormholes, leave Wormholes, joined with Atlas in the south, etc.
---
The point i am making, find what YOU  like doing, get good at that, ignore the other million things you cna do, and you will start to branch out as you realize you want and like other stuff.  It can easily keep you in eve for a long time, just all the crap there is to do and master.  But its YOUR story.  not the devs.  There is no set theme to play, no huge boss to kill.  Its like real life, do what you love and opportunists will come.  If you go into eve thinking its like WoW.. you are in for a bad time.
---
Well, please blackout Lowsec too, it would not change the style many people in Lowsec play. I guess you are getting along well, even find niches to use or abuse in this new mechanic. 
---
The problem is that Delve and surroundings have amassed a lot of players in Nullsec with Hisec attitudes since the Keepstar/Umbrella/Rorqual-Times in 2017 ... your coalition depends on amassing such players ... that is where CFCs problem is
---
Why not make a capital that is only for this purpose then?
---
I feel like your one of those people will stick their dick in a light socket without prompting to get a word into a conversation that revolves around a topic not even remotely close
---
No shit?
---
Never thought about it from that angle but very true. Pot meet kettle.
---
I mean join karmafleet get involved and become a goon we are very lovely people
---
Good. Makes things a little more spicy.
---
Because those umbrellas you all bitch about take a lot of work from dedicated people. Fuck off with the ‚Äútoo safe‚Äù idea. It‚Äôs only safe because the collective has chosen to protect each other. Many people have extra characters devoted solely to home defense and don‚Äôt make any money off them while keeping each other safe. Risk is always there, we just worked to reduce it. 
---
So many people act like it‚Äôs easy to run home defense, it‚Äôs not. You have to try and keep people motivated 23/7 when nothing may be happening for most of that. You have to know how to respond to any situation that comes up or when things start going wrong. We are not going to give out kills just because you want them or thinks they should be easier because you don‚Äôt have the slightest clue how a nullbloc defense actually works
---
The reality is that its turning null into one meta.
---
A) black ops /bomber drops
---
With only one reliable counter. 
---
B) Carriers or higher rating ,  rorgs only mining and  super shield. 
---
Anything smaller for ratting and mining  is learning not undock. Most small gangs that are being run into are also hunting and what they are hunting has dried up. 
---
The reality is long term this is not sustainable
---
Is there anything in there that is supposed to mean anything to me?
---

Ignoring blackout and speaking only of provi and recking crew from the provi prospective, we know when each other are formed and ready to do something, there are no surprises, we got spies deep on both sides, so we know when there are pings, we know when fleets are forming, we know who the super and titan pilots are, we know what's said on opposing comms. 
---
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
---
Blackout changes none of that, things are just more annoying now, not more dangerous.
---
Blackout is a half-assed idea, poorly planned and poorly executed, unless all the data sources, players in space, players docked, rats killed, etc get turned off as well, it's just not worth the risk to do anything, and thus the reason most nerds are just waiting it out.  The only real danger here is in nerds finding another game to play before blackout ends and not returning to eve.
---
The game now is relly boring for do almost any activity, pre-blackout  my friends and i used to do alot of diferent activitys alitle mining, alitle rating, do gas sites, etc, and almost every day at the hour that almost all login 6-10 guys in my corp used to go pvp 1-2 hrs (we sucked alot xD) but was fun, now this week we didnt find anything for engage and 5 ppl of my group stoped the omega and move other game, and im moving with them becuse  in my case what makes a game nice to play are the friends.
---
*silent clapping*
---
I mean NPC corps have a tendency to not be as cool as we are but your entitled to silly opinions
---
This is all about reporting good login rates to Korea, nothing else
---
Literally yes we give you free ships
---
Is there anything meaningful here for people who don't care about lore?
---
I can do them in a Buzzard which is a weaker Heron, so yes
---
Such exploit
---
Something something neutral highsec logi is back.
---
I agree with the friends part it's pretty important for game like this. I'm sorry to hear that
---
n=blues on grid
---
If reds+neuts = n+1, result ="blob";
---
If reds+neuts &gt; n+1, result ="massive blob";
---
I mean if you have the numbers why wouldnt they be used efficiently? Your logic is not sound
---
So rather than probing the ship you just probe the wrecks? It's the exact same thing but it would open up the whole salvaging playstyle some more.
---
Sounds like dueling which is already a thing.
---
Decent, fun, emerging content? From CCP??
---
You clearly don't know CCP.
---
i've been playing for 3 years and I still have no idea what i'm doing
---
Please define for me what punching above your weight means.
---
I'm under a super umbrella and this is what I've been preaching since its inception. I haven't undocked a single rorq since it went live. Only PVE to be done is in a Trimark/High Grade Slave Nyx under the Estoria umbrella and building shit for people. I have had fun messing up Frat, but I was doing that a little before blackout. My corp mates have moved to hunting credit card warrior sperg lords in low sec for actual content. It is nice to have the last laugh and be proven right after being constantly down voted for three weeks. What the fuck did people think me and other crabs would do, undock rorqs and smart bomb battleships and other shit that doesn't live long enough for a cyno to get to them with no way to prevent being massacred? Sure, you killed off botters, but you killed off at the keyboard pve players as well. Good job CCP and those of you with no foresight.
---
Nullsec activities lol
---
It becomes more fun and you start to love the complexity and the intrigues.
---
He suggested it being a way that "hunters" can find prey with less chance of being caught. This is the part im taking umbridge with so im not sure why youre arguing a point that im not talking about
---
Oh it's a boxing term I think where you pit a boxer against another boxer who is taller/larger than you the larger boxer will have the advantage due to weight and longer reach leaving the smaller boxer unable to hit em
---
Hahahahaha no fucking shit? This is exactly what i said a month ago!
---
Can you sing "Macarena" please ?
---
Ty I will continue to farm you guys till they remove blackout. It‚Äôs currently paying for 2 accounts :)
---
The two constants of life. Death and taxes.
---
Just go to highsec for some risk feee gameplay :)
---
I really agree with you on abyssal sites being in highsec. There's no way that this should be possible.
---
The VNI pilots which people usually are talking about dont need PLEX and it would in fact be stupid for them to do it. Ofc there are plenty of PLEX-subbed bots but Im fairly certain they are in the minority. Its pretty much only needed for bots in supers. But that wasnt really what OP was talking about was it? He was referring to the bot havens and those are generally VNIs.
---
No matter, they are way too few to actually break PLEX in the way described. Just check the numbers, just doesnt add up.
---
But everyones definition of null is either bots or bot aspirants as has been stated so many times. Which still means grr nullsec. Its not like people on this sub are saluting NS are they? Or as if no local isnt directed as NS and people are hailing it for its negative impacts on its members.
---
You love your definition of NS, not what it actually is. So you are still grr NS.
---
Yeah, it's totally unsuspicious in logs when some1 loots a stack of plex.
---
Very cool analysis overall.
---
shh they want the cows to line up and get shot and are upset when the cows downt do as they are told. Anyone with any sence knew this was coming. If your subcap has Zero chance of escape or survival your not going to use a sub. Other than the few "Traps" i am guessing there have been very few instances of ratters being able to overcome any hunter as most of the gangs are cloaky and only engage in fights that they will win. I all but gave up on ratting and have been flying subcaps around 1DQ trying to get hunters to engage with me but for the most part they wont unless they can 100% kill me. At one point i was just using the starter ships and they wouldent even engage me on gates.
---
You gon' dah bro!
---
Btw most of the null blocs have already established their borders for years and honestly don‚Äôt care if people take up space in systems in between. Hell we have the QFC next to delve which is a great area for small corps to develop without being renters. Goons just ask them to not shoot structures and we give them access to the left over moons from locust fleet. Cloud ring is under initiative influence but I believe is also open and free for small corps to enjoy and grow. 
---
Or you can go to the recently cleared out tribute and join the small corps building over there. Most null blocs just like to roam around for fun fleets and don‚Äôt both small corps that aren‚Äôt being rude
---
Those blocs already have enough caps to cover multiple regions.  They don't at the moment because they don't have to.
---
After driving everyone else into those blocs, the blocs have even more caps.
---
Also, if you're gonna make the blocs take more regions to farm, where exactly does the "little guy" manage to carve out a spot of null?
---
Ah no you actually survived. RESTEPC!
---
Other's have commented on the Freighter/JF side of things, but also consider transport ships, and Amarr DST (Impel) with implants and ded-modules are really fucking tanky, which disuades most gankers.
---
In your example, why would a person that regularly steals your loot agree to this?
---
Not sure if you realize actually removing jump freighters would basically make everyone but the few biggest groups be literally unable to play in null.
---
That said, my comment was in joke, since the entire subject was jump freighters and (as far as i'm aware... there might be a nutjob out there!) people don't bring those to fights.
---
like honestly, i doubt that guy has ever krabbed in null to begin with
---
nobody shoots a ratting ship with anything that's going to result in a fair fight. people don't hunt krabs for gudfites, they hunt them for dunks. if you're saying otherwise it's because you're stupid or pushing an agenda
---
I'm so sick of the big market teams like Arcurio steam rolling these poorly managed small market guys. How do they expect Caille to field a competitive team when the population of the system is academic types who don't give a fuck about pro sports and capsuleers who don't give a fuck about anything but themselves? The league needs to get serious about a salary cap and award some of these small markets some draft picks. Seriously, if you're a top prospect coming up in Villore and you have a choice between the Villore Vikings or the Mantenault Marauders who are YOU going to play for? Shit 1/2 the people who Mantenault drafts can't even get to the training facilities because capsuleers blow up the transport ships for what they call "the lulz". I just want my Marauders to have a shot at a ring, is that so much to ask?
---
"Not used to nullsec being what it should be". Your definition yet again. Other have other definitions. And local has been around since what, 2011? Thats a pretty long time dude.
---
And changing lowsec would be by removing all NPC stations. Now that would be an equivalent change which I would love. Because then LS wouldnt be safe anymore. If you talk shit or harass an entity too much they can just burn you out. But right no LS has no real risk, you dont own anything and your ships are always neatly packed in a station which cant be touched.
---
FYI, OP: These are not official CCP products but fan creations. A Harbinger one was never made, but I can give you an [Imperial-Issue Apocalypse schematic](https://eve-files.com/media/11/ImpocSchematic.jpg)!
---
Yet those in delve seem to be the ones crying the loudest ;thonking;
---
Holy cr*p thats awesome!
---
&gt; so that one could always engange in battle. 
---
Sure, just pay the price a whole war would cost so we don't lose the isk sink. No sense in ruining all the good blackout does out economy.
---
Yea, planes had floating names above them just like in real life.
---
it also completely kills boson ratting, which is a dumb thing that probably should have never existed to begin with
---
disclaimer: i have boson ratted under an umbrella. it's free money, but it's dumb af
---
Do we reallly \*need\* another HAC in a Box thread?
---
Seems you "grr nullbolcks" can't see that you are the reason for the state of the game. I don't blame you as you all took proper advantage of the available mechanics.  But try to stop acting so sanctimonious while trying to protect and bring back your safe game-play.
---
so... if you remove caps but leave the current state who will rat in nul? If you think people will just jump in subs to go rat and feed your wrong. That would be the final nail in the coffin for nul.
---
Yea man was fun, ever wanna brawl just poke balt we will come for the fun haha :)
---
Just one piece of advice: Mining - dont do it. Get a cheap imicus or whatever and go dive into wh-space...do relic sites and you will earn 100 mil per hour easily... if youd like, hit me up ingame, id even buy you your first explo ship and we can dive in together. 
---
Char: Raqn Cesaille
---
But would this be a positive development for Eve?
---
I don't know Spanish, and I definitely can't speak it that quickly or else I would give it a try.
---
You still seem to underestimate the implications on running 10 or 20 Alpha-Accounts simultaneously (as this is forbidden by EULA and ... poorly ... prohibited by the client). It needs some technical effort to run more than 1 Alpha. 
---
Also I never said that only Bots are responsible for the exploded PLEX demand and prices since 2017. The most damage is done by people just adding 10 Rorqual-Accounts that are fully plexed ... and keeping all them plexxed and skilling after they have all skills to extract from 10 Accounts to have their 2 months old Titan-Alt ready injected ...
---
Hmm cool, I'll definitely keep that in mind
---
There are incursions in nullsec you know
---
Brave and frat brings tons of fights. I actually get excited now when we get a wormhole to scalding pass or impass. Just because krabs won't undock doesn't mean everyone won't.
---
I mean, things like 10/10 and L5's are "designed for fleets", but CCP encounter design is so bad that you can run them solo/multiboxed in special fit ships.
---
Will be quitting now. This was the only way I could make money as I don't have enough time to be active 100% of the time. The tradeoff was always that I was vulnerable to enemies and players could kill me easily.
---
There's a trade-off, and it looks like dumbass players don't understand that concept. They have no clue how many people are going to leave after this. I spent a stupid amount of time training this fucking VNI thing so I could actually make some money, and now that's all gone. I have absolutely no way to make money now.
---
Adios Eve. Don't listen to dumb fucks on your forums asking for nerfs because people "afk play". Not everybody has time to constantly be active, they have fucking lives. Not everybody who plays is a neckbeard. And it wasn't "overpowered" because you were vulnerable while AFK.
---
Dont you cry tonight, yeah yeah yeah. Yeah.
---
I guess the other issue is you need to grind standings for that as well right? 
---
It is good isk per hour for sure though just requires a bit more tedium effort.  I really like the way Abyssals are going lot less boring than ratting anoms etc. Then again I‚Äôm on the extreme lazy credit swipe bandwagon most of the time
---
O.o
---
The vast majority of the "elite PVPers" on r/Eve were expecting just that.
---
This is also true of pretty much everyone proposing changes on r/Eve \- the person proposing changes assumes the target of their change will just keep doing what they were doing.
---
Get ready for the "let's force people to spread out" change to "fix" everyone mining/ratting under super umbrellas.  After which everyone who cheered that will :surprisedPikachu: when the blocks conquer and super-umbrella more regions.
---
You didn't mess up at all - the Orca is a rather versatile ship to have trained since it's the smallest hauler that can carry large citadels(Tatara, Azbel, Fortizar) and can move an enormous amount of compressed ore in one go with its massive ore hold. It's also a very safe solo miner having a huge amount of EHP, and with mining drones works quite quickly.
---
Though gas mining in wormholes is very good ISK for new players, I wouldn't say it's the be all end all. Use that as an opportunistic fun activity rather than a consistent source.
---
&gt; "Not used to nullsec being what it should be". Your definition yet again.
---
Nope, that is CCPs definition that was valid until 2016
---
there are still places where there are hunting opportunities but you have to be willing to go a bit bigger than blops to make those dunks happen, and there's a very real risk that you get counter dropped and look like a retard because umbrellas are just that strong; even when the krab you tackle barely has a pulse it's not hard to light a cyno, x in fleet, and let someone with a functional brain do the rest
---
I have been looking, but can't seem to find a frigate fit for t2s. Do you have one you can share?
---
I approve this message. Come to delve for fun! Sometimes we kill what comes here, sometimes we just feed tackle sigh. We will definitely not just run away though
---
My best guess is that at some point this will lead to a new consolidation of CONCORD as the Empire's military force against external threats, changing the ways in which Empires solve their conflicts (which in game could mean anything from changing HS missions to reshaping Fac War) and how CONCORD behaves in HS and LS.
---
Lol yes bro. üòÇ this shit made me laugh. :)))
---
ATTENTION ALL KRABS! MOVE TO WHS! IT IS NOW SAFER THAN NULLSEC! YOU CAN CONTROL WHO ENTERS AND WHO LEAVES! REPEAT, MOVE TO WHS!
---
You still have to field the super and botting in it is a bad idea now. Not best but a better eve.
---
Lol at knowing how to respond to a given situation. A super can answer any threat anyway, what to know then? 
---
And when you only want to play Farmville why are you playing eve anyway?
---
this
---
How about no mutual consensus, but 1 year cd or something?
---
Also yes, neutral logi would totally be back. I have no clue on how to fix that.
---
Loot should be rewarded to the attacker.
---
Dude, you have virtual machines. Thats not even an issue.
---
But thats what OP as saying. And Im saying hes talking out of his ass., i.e., not reasonable facts and data. He has inflation and deflation backwards as well, not to mention that he is only using one market point, PLEX price to discuss something that covers the entire market and so on. Its filled with mistakes, that was my point.
---
Well, consdering thats most of NS according to most. But really I dont care if you are or arent. OP presents a post full of mistakes and assumptions in an attempt to sound "smart" and try to convince people he knows what hes talking about. And alot of people are actually buying it. I dont think hes doing it because he loves NS but rather its just another post in a long line of posts that are grr NS. 
---
I could be wrong sure, maybe he loves NS. But I have a feeling that is not the case. But what I do know is that he doesnt get what hes talking about. And that my friend is a fact.
---
Kick everyone with a reddit account.
---
Plex has been given out during events as loot...
---
Remove asset safety from nullsec. Make nullsec dangerous again. Give loot to the attackers.
---
Not sure what happened there.
---
Slow approach: Get familiar with the hacking minigame. Practice in Hisec util you know what you are doing (+ rule of 6). Then move to LowSec and practice to D-Scan. Lastly find a wormhole in a system far from a trade hub and see what you find there
---
"deep end first" approach is just the last sentence.
---
Maybe swing by the [Signal Cartel](https://www.signalcartel.com/) ingame channel "EvE-Scout".

---
minmatar has the ammo specialized one. also amarr can squeeze the most cargo on a t1 industrial and caldari are just not very good as far as t1 industrials go.
---
No, he should run them anyway. New player experience and there's value in them.
---
Perhaps remove the innate ore grades (ie concentrated/dense veldspar) and then have the mining equipment reintroduce the grading. So a rorqual mines veldspar, gets veldspar, a hulk mines veldspar and gets stable veldspar with the other grades being distributed through the ship stack.
---
He's not being honest. Stick to the normal pirate relic and data. Do them all and get good at hacking them
---
Then who would rat in null... people wont feed ships to hunters and only thing ratting right now for the most part is caps
---
They're genuinely amazing. They've downsold me on stuff a few times.
---
Eg. When I wanted to buy a new video card and the manonthephone persuaded me that it was just memory that was my weak link.
---
Their aftercare is next level to the point I feel guilty when I call them
---
Lmao what do you suggest needs balancing in wormhole income? They've definitely made big changes to income before to prevent extreme income, so that's not even really much of a thing anymore.
---
Unless you're advocating for more connections between certain classes to increase potential player movement in places where people tend to farm, I'm not really super sure what you would do to "balance" it but I'd love to hear.
---
Also lowsec doesn't have insane safe isk making so that's probably why op didn't mention it the way you want and also ccp very much has talked about it and the fact they made the stab change indicates some level of intent. But like I said let's hear your ideas.
---
Gotta get those new players hooked on skins! First one's always free...
---
CCP dont make definitions, players do. They can say whatever they want but its we that decide what is what.
---
Lol see, as soon as a negative change is talked about for anyone else this is what we get. Lol. Its about changing a core mechanic for something, in LS and NPC null that is stations, in WHs thats local, in HS thats CONCORD. 
---
And I never said you said it, I said it. You say removing local in LS wont change how LS players do their thing. Ofc it wont, which is why it cant be used as an argument. Remove the one thing they actually use, stations, and shit will hit the fan. So when you accept no stations in LS, Ill accept no blackout. But in reality, although I would love to burn LS to the ground, I wouldnt want the change. Because I know it will hurt newer players the most and make the game more stale.
---
You don't need your own fax.  You need a fax in the standing fleet that's ready to jump.
---
imo occator shames all the other DSTs because 3 mids is the optimal for my DST holy trinity, which consists of mwd, mjd, burst jammer. impel only has 2 mids, so no burst jammer, while on the others you have to sacrifice tank to fit those. also iirc from the time I spent theorycrafting it, occator has the smallest model for decloaking purposes.
---
Well considering it's 20 minutes max, what does that even mean honestly. Unless you mean too slow for potential income which is subjective based on investment so.. What?
---
NOVA is coming....
---
Carriers and supers are kinda a pain to rat in, compared to old VNIs.  You have to pay attention, instead of launch-drones-and-Netflix.
---
So lots of people who already owned carriers/supers would actually have a fleet of alts rat in VNIs.  Sure, the individual ticks were much worse, but you had 5 of them instead of 1.  And you could do it for 5 hours instead of 1.
---
&gt; and if you are mining without being afk you have more than enough time to pull In excavator.
---
Well considering the while community is, it's not like some secret language. What does that even mean lmao
---
Well, as an economist, I can tell you that his basic assumptions are right, and they coincidentally just reflect everything that CCP economist Quant has warned of in 2016/17 before they booted him. 
---
Does he leave out certain issues ... yes ... in science you call this abstraction model (and thats a common tool in economy).
---
It is a non deniable and proven by server stats FACT that since the implementations of Citadels and Lifeblood mining the number of avg. logged in accounts has plummeted by 30-40% (55-65k EU prime saturday 2015, 30-35k EU prime saturday now). In the same time the value of "accounts per player" has risen dramatically due to Rorqual Multiboxing in combination with SP farming. The players that have quit EVE since then were mostly PvP-guys, subbing their accounts with real cash, and further buying plex with cash to sell ingame as they hated pve-grind. Meanwhile guys loving to afk-farm stuf on multiboxes while watching netflix and not even playing the game have created more and more accounts. These guys plex in 9 of 10 cases, as otherwise this whole model would make no sense. And this is why PLEX price is where it is. Supply has fallen, and demand has risen dramatically.
---
Not much ‚Äúhigh reward‚Äù when they keep trying to nerf the anoms/bounties/anomalies into the ground. People are only going to play a game if they are having fun. If they do not enjoy how things have changed, then I can understand leaving. No everyone plays the same and some changes are going to ruin your playstyle to the point where it just sucks. Players like you ruin eve
---
That's not the same thing as being seeded on the market. All Plex listed on the market are sold by players.
---
-10 personal standing.
---
I believe that this is a giant step towards NOVA. AEGIS was formed in response to Case Green Magic, which is the Sansha attacks on the shipping lanes that was the precursor story to NOVA (CCPs upcoming FPS set in the EVE Universe). The Sansha is/was the principle villain of NOVA as far as we understand. 
---
As we approached Invasion, it was made clear that AEGIS now also was in change of Case Red Magic, which is the Trig/Drifter threat. 
---
The Trig have been raiding installations and planets, and it would seem they are finally pulling together to form a new defense force 'including highly expensive backup personality recording systems.
---
I could be wrong, but every step since Invasion has included some hints to what will be eventually Project NOVA, this is just the most direct one.
---
The funny thing is the planes do have names above them in Simulator, just not the tanks.
---
Sorry, did i misread your comment?
---
Because that 22b is worth about 10b, inflation-adjusted.
---
Deflation doesn't just affect hulls.
---
I would accept no citadels and just stations everywhere also in Nullsec. Same goes for blackout. You still have not got the message that citadels are a major factor for EVE going to shit, as they make everything  static, non-rewarding and hello-kitty-safe (asset safety)
---
I mined thousands of hours and never got any exca killed, with a proper keybind it take a few sec to pull them.
---
I am genuinely interested, got a kill mail and the aar?
---
Probably, I'm not even sure what your original point was so I assumed you were making a joke.
---
There was a wingspan tengu fit for long range rails most likely that was decloaking throughout the prep and fight, trying to shoot dessies and pods.
---
You said that simulation mode doesn‚Äôt tag your teammates.
---
Think your right. It already came andy when i had to transport some stuff
---
Limited Sleeper at least is doable.
---
10/10 goodpost
---
Incursions I don't have too much of a problem with, although the ISK you can generate is pretty absurd for the risk and it should be reduced (in highsec at least), because they are very limited in number. Abyssals, well they don't actually fountain much isk so the income there is self-regulating in the long run (i.e. if enough people do it then the value of the drops goes down), but I would like to see the suspect flag come back for T4 and 5.
---
carajo!
---
Ah that scoundrel!
---
E-Uni's incursion group seems to be more active than it used to be so maybe this is a question of different people doing it, and the old public groups' leaders burning out.
---
It's not. It seems like he's conflating am increase in demand /income causing an increase in prices (normal) vs an increase in prices causing an increase in demand (a giffen good).
---
You say that but also many groups will run away from bhaalgorns vs Armageddons.
---
Not always black and white, always many factors.
---
Well for the comment it still makes sense, only people who play War Thunder will need to know the distinction between SB Air and GF.
---
Thanks I'm gonna go install these now
---
Do the x mark safe or unsafe ones?
---
What i want to say is when i play games like that with no hud and only using your eyes to spot the enemy, it makes it even more immersive, like if you‚Äôre really there.
---
But Abyssal aren't a ISK sink. The only thing you loose over there is your ship,not you isk.
---
And wormholes. Some people have argued that local should be delayed only if you enter via wormhole or cyno, but I'm not sure if I like that. I worry it would make blops the main roaming method and it's nice to have people roaming using gates.
---
Cloaking for alpha?
---
I've never heard of that game, I'll have to look it up.
---
This couldnt be exploited in any way imaginable
---
This is a somewhat decent HAW (anti-sub) fit.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78036320/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78036320/) 
---
This is a somewhat decent anti-cap fit.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77975324/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77975324/) 
---
HAW fits tend to be active whilst anti-cap tends to be buffer since the latter usually finds itself in places it might die very hard. But you can do a mix so you have an active anti-cap fit like this  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78005754/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78005754/). I dont know how much fitting room you have on this fit but a capital neut would be great if possible so play around with the fit and lower costs as much as possible.
---
In general go T1 weapons on anti-cap fits and T2 on HAW. But always fit according to your wallet.
---
&gt;That isn't the same thing nor is it the only thing. An rl government can specify an exact monthly figure down to the cent that they want to put into their money supply. CCP can fiddle with the bounty figures but that's going to have secondary and tertiary effects elsewhere in the economy, and also assumes peoples behaviour won't change based on those bounty prizes (which they absolutely will).
---
How, exactly, do you think central banks add money to their economy? I've never just gotten a check from the government for no reason (except for the one-time stimulus package of a few hundred bucks that went out a decade ago at the bottom of the recession). All of the money that goes into the economy is still based on citizens taking some sort of action. It can happen via government procurement contracts and reduced prime interest rates, but both of those things still require somebody to take, and fulfill, that contract, or get a loan. Both of those things are countered by taxes, by the way. The same with rat bounties. If CCP wants more people ratting, they can increase rat bounties, which would also increase the amount of money that goes into the economy. CCP actually has way more control because there are vastly more ways they can introduce money to the game economy without legal scrutiny.
---
&gt;You're kinda missing the point though which is that it is mechanically impossible for CCP to create net zero inflation, something which would be absolutely trivial (though almost certainly undesirable) for a real central bank.
---
Controlling inflation is harder than you think. It requires a solid understanding of economic markets and human psychology, and a hell of a lot of luck that your predictions are correct. The federal reserve is playing the market exactly the same way stock traders do, just with different goals and global effects if they fuck it up.
---
The notion that it's easier for a government to control inflation than a game developer is a little... out there.

hunters wont hear it, already talking about forcing people out of caps by making anoms where caps cant go in. They dont understand people will just stop ratting all together and move operations to make cash. The meta has moved so far in favor of the hunters that the only way to survive is under an umbrella in something big. They want people to line up to die but forget the crabs need a reason to crab and that sole reason cant be to provide easy targets for hunters.
---
This is so sadly true. I haven‚Äôt heard any ideas that truely help/encourage smaller groups take space and not just join the bigger group. 
---
The day THAT patch (IF such a thing is possible) comes out might actually be the day the ‚Äúeve is dieing‚Äù memes will stop
---
Idk this kinda seems like propaganda to me. Don‚Äôt goons whip applicants that don‚Äôt own a rorq alt?
---
Stopped reading after ‚Äúi havent played in 2-3 years‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs some carebear shit right there
---
Done and you‚Äôre welcome. Which LS system you pick btw wanna know where to go for content.
---
&gt; I wonder if you can explain how a vast over supply of ISK has driven Plex prices higher. I always thought that oversupply of an item caused its value/worth to drop.
---
You answered your own question - over supply of ISK reduces its value and so measured against the roughly fixed real value of PLEX, PLEX is worth more ISK.
---
&gt; unlike the real world people do not need to "suck it up" when things go poorly they simply stop playing thus creating more deflationary pressure and a death spiral of less players more deflation etc
---
How many people quit because PLEX is too cheap (in ISK terms)? Yes, people can choose to leave the economy, but they're more likely to do so because PLEX is too high.
---
maybe he think that 10-20m ISK per TIK for Ishtar (RIP VNI) is high-reward :-D  lol
---
Clearly this, I don't think anyone actually read this horse shit pile of complete terribleness - that or no one here actually understands a fly's nutsack worth of markets &amp; financials.
---
Have fun exploring. It's one of must reliable isk sources as a rookie. A good relic site in WH will pay 15 times you ship.
---
You are going to lose a few, that is ok. Its part of the process. 
---
As you hack the minigame on cans. Stay orbiting the can, don't stay still. Use safe spot as you probe the WH. REMEBER SAFE THE WH EXIT. Use your Dscan as you probe/hack. Check the WH name on Zkill to see if anyone lives there. Never, ever, speak on local of WH space. If you see combat probes from your safe, or see anything as you hack. GTFO. Asume that everyone is trying to kill you, because they are. If your internet is gone and you reconect, you didnt lose your probes. On The window, top right, it's a icon to reconnect probes. Always carry more than a set of probes just in case. Stay moving, that guy from before still wants to kill you.
---
Welcome new bro, enjoy the explo life.
---
It's a new feature to help you enjoy a more engaged gameplay for longer than you originally thought you wanted to enjoy it.
---
&gt; And how are you connecting alpha account bots to PLEX prices going up? Makes no sense because they dont need PLEX
---
They're adding ISK to the economy.
---
Light cyno drop multitude of supers is gudfites, much paps.
---
I think sombody at CCP had a bet going about how they could alter the VNI market price by 50%.  The blackout plus the AFK ratting nerf are the desired 1-2 punch to the prices needed to hit that goal.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Or, even better, whipe the whole database
---
Two things I read into this:
---
* An increase in taxes
---
* A change in capsuleer clone possibilities
---
See that wasnt the trade. Im saying switch a core mechanic for a core mechanic. You are just saying you want it worse for NS.
---
And can people stop talking about asset safety. You know you didnt lose anything before citadels right? You just lost access, not the stuff. It literally makes no difference and that is by far not a major factor for Eve going to shit. 
---
Not really, the timers allow ample time to move stuff. The ones who are getting hurt are the smaller guys and the ones that arent active at the time. Which is why asset safety is even their in the first place.
---
Which is fine. Right now ratting is printing way too much liquid isk into the game.
---
what does my comment warrant this irrelevant response?
---
&gt; Idea behind those extra spawns was to block people from using capitals, not use them to get those spawns
---
Can we have something like this in nullsec anomalies?
---
You know rorquals are perfectly safe under a cap umbrella as well? You can‚Äôt use excavators but augmented miners or miner 2 s do just fine to still be cost effective. People in delve were nervous too but we are all back to happily mining away, just at a slower pace than before. Don‚Äôt be too worried and just make sure your umbrella team are awake before setting up mining. Keep DScan up and use it every now and then to just keep an eye on the local fauna. You too can put up the proverbial middle finger to hunters as they stare at your rorqual who doth have no fear
---
Which means what? As long as they are not buying isk it wont matter. But it was rhetorical as he is under the impression that bots PLEX, which is not the case.
---
But.... an angry Russian man may roll into me and hurt me!
---
God you are insufferable.
---
Legitimate question. Have you actually found people regularly ? This was 100% the case for the first week or so for me, but it has dropped dramatically. I can easily go 30 jumps and not see a soul now. What time zone you in?
---
That's fair honestly, the widow could use some love for sure. But I do agree all around balancing would be best. Remote clone bays sounds like a bad plan to me still.
---
I have the exact same issue on my laptop, only way to reliably close eve is to select the exefile, then press show details, then end process tree
---
I still have no idea what the problem is, I suspected synergy (mouse and keyboard sharing between multiple devices) could be the issue but even after shutting that down I have this issue
---
If we would be able to find out the cause that would be amazing
---
Also reinstalled eve at least 2 times to no avail
---
Fair point, I am sure it could be balanced this way.
---
I legit have to see if this is a meme or if it‚Äôs actually as bad as people say it is.
---
He's a noobie. Just started playing. Its a perfect change that's needed. Maybe definitely likely perhaps some bit of balancing is needed
---
lol what bait
---
All true. Trying to think of all the ways the two galaxies could interact would be a fun experiment in worldbuilding, and I'm glad to see someone else shares my interest in it.
---
clone soldiers? What's that?
---
What does that mean?
---
Supers are not always the answer and home defense is my pvp joy in Eve. We have people getting caught outside super range that need other forms of help. Sometimes it‚Äôs too dangerous to just send in supers until you prep an area with subcaps. Sometimes the person you are trying to help is brain dead and you need to scout out situations on your own that can cost you valuable saving time. The possibilities are endless
---
Eve is not just pew pew laser pew pew kill murder death and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs great. Many people just love mining, building, PI, market trading, and even hauling. Your narrow minded view of PVP pew pew only Eve is what kills games like this.
---
It basically means someone has to be the bad guy, so they are doing it.  An EVE without pvp assholes to hate would be pretty boring.
---
The incursion community is toxic?
---
Keep in mind that people (like me) will be looking to kill you while you are hacking the site. Use d scan often and fly T1 cheapo scoops until you are ready for the next level.
---
Highsec is safer than nullsec
---
Also Google the Eve Magic 14. Skills to train while you figure out what you ultimately want to do.
---
Other things need to be balanced along side it of course. As it is now it's safer to run whs then it is to rat in null, and more profitable. Though if anyone gave it a try there isn't enough room for everyone. 
---
EvE has a big economy and it needs to be balanced, which is why changing one fucking thing like turning of local is either useless or just plain retarded. But yes the end goal would be to get people to spread out and use sub/t1 barges to rat and mine primarily. But the other sources that make stupid isk or rival the isk of current anoms need to be balanced (some missions like burners, wh, maybe fw payout etc). There's far too much inflation in eve as it is, be good to finally start cutting down.
---
Those are elite rats that spawn in asteroid belts in low sec. They hit pretty hard but if you go with a frigate and manage to get under its weapons you can kill it. They drop tags you can sell in the market.
---
My only real beef for the blackout, especially if this is just a test to implement it permanently... If null stats blacked out, what's the diff between null and wh anymore. Sure there are size restrictions etc, but the main part of wh space was that you were basically invisible because of no local. It's why cloakers fly around in there to hide from d-scan. 
---
If local stays dead in null, wh space will need something to make it unique I think.
---
&gt; I think everyone agrees that having more expensive stuff in space is a good thing
---
Not if the price for expensive stuff being out is fucking everyone else over. And that is what happened.
---
&gt; Carriers were pretty much only used by bots and stupid people who got laughed at or fined when they died. Supers were coffins that spent most of the year logged off and unassailable.
---
Not really true. Sentry drone carriers and supers were one of the primary ratting vehicles and esp in the deep drone regions there were several people ratting in titans. Not as many as today, but there were.
---
&gt; Nowadays, there are thousands of supers and rorquals in space, all of which are potential killmails
---
Just like winning the lottery is a *potential win* but in reality it is a waste of time and money.
---
&gt; They should be careful about what they wish for, because if it drifts too far, null will just become dead again.
---
And maybe they would move to other areas of the game and revitalize them. Sov null has been draining every other area of space into the void with how easy and effective it was.
---
Overall you make good points but maybe we should not move from one extreme to the other but something needs to be done by CCP.
---
japans negative intrest rate says you forgot about it
---
Water is nice for those of us with picky taste buds like me; I *literally* can't have coffee or alcohol because of this.
---
Holy fuck you are autistic.
---
Dude, Im a fking economist as well and Im  saying hes wrong. Talking about deflation when its actually inflation means hes wrong, its a fact, not a guess or opinion. And you dont measure that with 1 entry point, thats also a fact. I havent read what Quant said but if this is it, then I understand why they booted him.
---
Sure but that doesnt mean they left because of those things. You can assume that much but thats just an assumption. Correlation does not imply causation after all.
---
That might be true ye but you know what also might be true? Skill farms. Those have pressed the PLEX price far more than anything else. They constantly need PLEX, 500 + 2\*485/account. People have had multiple hundreds of accounts running during the peak. Now that drives up demand far more than a minority of Rorq multiboxers. And it is a minority, people always talk about the multiboxing Rorq as if everyone in NS is rocking 10 Rorqs, thats just not true.
---
For those unable to read between the lines:
---
&gt;According to the plan outlined by Marshals Elladall and Valkanir, the New Eden Defense Fund would: pay for essential works to improve planetary and station defenses; provide resources for CONCORD defense fleet repairs, replacements and expansion; and fund research into anti-Triglavian and anti-Drifter countermeasures. Key elements of the plan also focus on recruitment drives to make up losses in personnel, a program of enhanced training and augmentation of troops, and funding for personal survival equipment ‚Äì including highly expensive backup personality recording systems.
---
The last time New Eden saw tech like this was the clone soldiers of DUST 514. We know CCP has been working on an FPS project.
---
Sounds like they‚Äôre laying down the lore groundwork for the introduction.
---
oh.. is it that worth it? Sounds like a lot of warping to random belts during hours without finding anything..
---
I haven't had a single encounter doing it. Sometimes you can see if someone else is hunting them and if I see a clone soldier I just bookmark it and I warp out waiting for the other person to find it. But it's pretty obvious and they just leave it if there is someone else in the system. But for the most part the systems are empty. I've had days when I haven't seen a single soul for 2 hours.
---
Well if you want to look good
---
*\*Sigh\*,* you're right. In Stellaris, the Triglavians are actually a threat.
---
Yo fuckhead, us old farts are why this game is still around. Go practice dance moves in Fortnite if you're offended by ppl who were already shooting stuff for decades before your daddy shot out the sperm that became you.
---
What's the best way to keep a smartbombing Super tackled as a single dictor?
---
I was the dictor in a small gang when we found a super. We pinged our alliance but there was some time before they arrive. I was keeping my bubbles up but had to drop them every 1:20? minutes because he was burning out FAST. I'm not sure if we had scram on him so he might have been MWDing.
---
But when I needed to reload my last bubble got killed by the smartbombs and he got out.
---
So the question is: What can I do to keep him there because I have to drop the bubbles close to him so he can't burn out but not too close to him because of the smartbombs...  Is it even possible to keep such a super tackled assuming perfect play from him?
---
In the show the outer ring didn't appear to be touching the ship. I think it's for their FTL... Only watched one ep so far. Wasn't the greatest not sure if I'll make anther.
---
&gt; no issue finding fights when i head out.
---
Fights, or EZ killmails?
---
I like this idea as something that you'd fit on a ship with salvage bonuses such as salvage probes. If attached to combat probes it would make it too easy for cloaky campers or hunters to scan down an otherwise smart salvager running eccm scripts or cloaking when probes are out.
---
u got rekt
---
&gt; WH space is MUCH safer (no hot drop)
---
This is the new nullbear line apparently. But it isn't really relevant whether you can hot drop, if you're ratting in a subcap you are going to get dunked by a tackle tengu and his 5 mates waiting outside the hole just as effectively as if it were a cyno tengu.
---
It's warping from belt to belt for the most part. But you can find 1 or 2 in each system, sometimes zero. I tend to do at least 100m an hour, up to 200m. Every tag is worth 35m (counting the bounty for killing the rat and sell price) so if you find 1 every 20 minutes then you're head to head with a ratting carrier.
---
 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) , This will be your go to from now on till you start learning what does what . But it seems confusing at first but like all things it will come to you as you move along in the game .
---
Thank you sir
---
&gt;Players like you ruin eve
---
I echo the sentiment.
---
Do you have a jackdaw fit you can sure? im looking to side with Minmatar against Amarr. Or is there another faction i should ally?
---
Damn... gotta try that thing. Thanks for the explanation mate
---
&gt; We're changing how the game is played at a fundamental level because CCP was incapable of coming up with an effective counter to bots?
---
No, we're changing how the game's played because the rules of the game weren't conducive to having fun. The fact it screws over bots is a big bonus, though.
---
Abyssals don't result in any isk loss.
---
No isk leaves the game in the running of abyssals, I ckuding dying inside of them.
---
If anything, it's still an economic level isk faucet, as insurance claims generate isk.

 [https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/409/safety-can-i-warp-to-this-site](https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/409/safety-can-i-warp-to-this-site)  You might need this for a bit .

Get this out of here. This spot is reserved for REEEEing
---
My alt with caldari freighter 4 has better capacity than my other toon with amarr 5.... So I'm with you on the m3&gt;all angle.
---
But unemployment is so low!
---
&gt; It means more certainty that the ship your attack at least can't drop a capital fleet on you.
---
But not that he doesn't have an alt cloaked 10km away from the gate in a cyno capable ship. Locals can always have that one more character and so your change would actually make it even more impractical to hunt, because the locals can capital blob you with zero risk of a counter-drop.
---
No your guys also reinforced our structure after those wh people decided to mot come back.
---
And what about new players coming into the game. You're suddenly going to make it very hard for a new players to play the game that way.
---
So, there is a reason there has not been a major war among developed countries in 75 years, and that reason is analogous to what has happened in eve over the last 16 years. 
---
In the real world, developed countries have highly integrated economies, combine with the military power to cause every potential conflict with a non-asymmetric opponent to be an existential affair, which could completely destroy the the economy, the people, and the state apparatus within a country. 
---
CCP did an amazing job when they designed this game, giving people something to claim, fight over, and creating an environment where  losing *actually hurts* on a visceral level. 
---
No shock then that as the game evolves, the institutions that develop in null sec tend to scale towards the large, then the null sec bloc economies become integrated, and the arms race involves the proliferation of expensive super weapons. All of this, in turn, incentives relative peace behind null sec groups, and the growth of military structures that respond immediately and with overwhelming asymmetrical force to violations of sovereignty, or the eve equivalent of Somali pirates harassing line members in sov space. 
---
There is *literally* no way you can fix this, because to even attempt to fix it, destroys what makes this game great. You'd have to make PVP more meaningless, you would have to remove sovereignty entirely, you would have to remove or simplify the complicated production chains of items, spread resources evenly throughout the game (make the same salvage, ice, and rocks available everywhere), etc.
---
Bring something tanky with a scram and web to help with tackle next time. With the super slowed down you can drop bubbles further away from him and he won‚Äôt be able to burn out or burn in and smartbomb before you reload. 
---
If you are alone, then there is not much you can do
---
Nope, I never reinforced your structure and I was the only WiNGSPAN person planning in there. It was friends of the people you ‚Äòevicted‚Äô.
---
- Bots generate ISK
---
- Much of that ISK is RMT'd (because why else run a bot farm), i.e. sold to other players at say $5 per 2 bil
---
- Those other players then buy PLEX with the ISK, increasing demand
---
Alternatively
---
- ISK is funnelled to players or alliances
---
- ISK is given away for alliance projects (SRP etc) which makes line members richer
---
- Some line members decide to buy PLEX with the extra ISK they have, instead of paying RL¬£ for a sub, increasing demand
---
Adding ISK to the economy, unless they literally just sit on it and never spend it, is going to result in ISK inflation of goods in the market in general at some point.
---
We don't really see it with most items because the ridiculous levels of null safety have also resulted in a huge supply of minerals over the last couple of years, which exceeds the extra spending capacity of the extra ISK. But we do see it with PLEX because the supply of that isn't affected by nullsec safety.
---
I'm running only T1 darks with a cheap fit. But it is a breeze, one filament around 8min and 60mil ISK per hour sometimes more with rare loot. I was doing it as alpha.
---
Now I'm omega and I'm going to try fit around 600mil ISK and do T2 darks maybe T3.
---
No you don't understand. The theoretical potential to lose anything is TOO MUCH DANGER.
---
I think there used to be a mod.
---
here is what i'd do in your particular usecase - swap out the nanobot accelerator with a current router and exchange the ion blasters with neutrons. that will both give you some more dps and makes your tank sustainable as you seem to assume a usecase were you have both reppers run permanently. the hp/s will still be higher than before the change.   
---
yes the dps is still gonna be a bit lower than before it but it will still pack over 700 which i find pretty high for a cruiserhull with a reasonable pvp fit. for whatever youre doing with it youre basically exchanging some dps for more tank which, for a "heavy tackle", sounds not like too bad of a thing.
---
This is incorrect captain retard, we are currently fighting other gangs of people and response fleets.
---
And nobody roamed before because local let everybody know where you are, so everybody docked at the slightest threat. 
---
Sorry that this thread is a bunch of angry raters but the rest of us are getting some of the best fights we've ever had in over a decade of game play
---
I like the Heron for the Extra mid slot . You can fit two scanning arrays that way .
---
Without reading the other comments....Eve is a game that doesnt really do the whole hand holding thing.  There are some decent tutorial missions that will get you started but the real experience and knowledge will come from the player base itself.  You can also find info on most things via youtube vids that are very helpful, but joining the social aspect of Eve is the absolute most important thing for new players imho.  Not everyone will agree with that but thats ok.
---
Eve is a massive game with a ton of different aspects involved.  I've been playing since 2004 and still learn new things and have new experiences to enjoy.  If you get involved with an active newb friendly corp, that will help you a lot in learning how to efficiently do what you want to do in the game.  Dont be afraid to move corps if the one you are in isnt helping you with what you need.  
---
You must go into anything with the mindset that you will not do it well to begin with.  Eve isnt an instant gratification game.  Plan on losing stuff.  You will die, repeatedly.  You will still die even after you think you have it figured out.  Be ready for the failures, they will happen repeatedly.
---
If you find a good group of people to join, have patience with the learning process and dont take things to seriously then you will find Eve to be one of the best games available.  Good luck with whatever you decide and have fun doing it. o7
---
Here's the deal though, hunters don't hunt because they love killing Krabs, they hunt to try to elicit a pvp response.  If people are defending their pipe with a handful of subcaps, I get my pvp from those and move on without killing a krab at all.
---
Nah, Panfam is definitely feudal. I just chased a neut through three regions of renter space.
---
u must be dummie to say that...im doing much more isk now  than pre blackout,ded sites arte worth running also exploration is good
---
There‚Äôs a strange and rare bug that I have experienced that might explain this. If you disconnect upon undocking, occasionally your ship will warp itself, while empty, into the very centre of the sun. It is impossible to reach due to bouncing, and will remain there until it dies.
---
No, it isn't hard.  The most difficult thing is finding something to do that peaks your interest.
---
They have a niche in hisec already.
---
It's dead.. it started as a free half life mod. They stopped working on it in favour for a paid version on a whole other engine so the mod lost population overtime and waned during the development
---
The blackout is bad for eve. I won't play. Does not apeal to me.  Say what you will.  I  pay cash to play.  My 3 accounts are bringing in money now. GG CCP
---
It has alot allready mass restrictions, harder rats, no star gate system, scanning based navigation, Local effects e,g black hole an wolf ryte. 
---
It could still be expanded on but its by no means not unique.
---
I'll agree on one point, reward needs to be increased to match the increased risk.
---
Nullsec rewards were nerfed several times due to what happened with blocs.
---
The removal of local has made nullsec penetration far easier for those interested in trying, unless you get probed, you aren't immediately called out in intel channels and ran down within 5 minutes of hitting nullsec. This is a big plus for small scale stuff in nullsec, gankers, pvers, explorers and what not.
---
On the blackout front, I will say it's been a far bigger positive than negative for small scale players. 
---
But as I've said, I will agree that reward could be increased to go along with it.
---
Quite literally look at sniggwaffes billboard. All around eve is where we are finding fights
---
&gt;The meta has moved so far in favor of the hunters that the only way to survive is under an umbrella in something big. 
---
That's not true. You can rat in relative safety by putting an alt on your gates. Listen for gate fire and dock up if you hear it. Or put alts on the other side of the gate and see who is coming in.
---
You can also stream all this to people through twitch, replacing the current chat based intel system. 
---
I mean, we do stuff like this in whs. (Put alts on whs). It works better damn well.
---
You just need to adapt.
---
You should find people to teach you. Eve is absolutely littered with 'em, so it won't be hard. Plenty of corps willing to bring new players on, and they will get you up to speed quickly.
---
its like beating some new guy up at work and then going    
---
"heres a blank check for the hospital and some adresses for self defense coaches"
---
Delayed local is actually worse then no local. It takes away all the ambush/Baiting capabilities the defender has and dashes them on the wall.
---
Just go to highsec bro
---
I am more of attacking the attitude of the the e-leet pvp players who want to crush every aspect of pve that people enjoy because they don‚Äôt like how hard it is to kill people or that people make more money than them. They whine and bitch about things they don‚Äôt understand and then are flabbergasted that pve players *exist* and don‚Äôt readily make themselves food. 
---
I swirled in a few frustrations at the same time because this past week has been a cluster fuck of idiots suggesting changes to mechanics without the slightest clue of how bad they are.
---
Someone asked Pari if he was CEO before lol
---
There are similar knobs.
---
For example, Ratting payout can be changed to a mix of LP and isk like missions. This reduces the isk faucet from ratting while compensating ratters with goods rewards in the form of LP.
---
That's odd, because my 3 accounts now are. Until the blackout ends that is.
---
Well you did soo...
---
You know how certain ships that align in less than 2 seconds can't be locked? Well, Titans bypass that with their AOE doomsday, which damages ships in warp just like smartbombs. Bored titans sit on gates and fire doomsdays at interceptors that can't die to regular ships.
---
This so fucking much! The rewards have been pushed so far down that now the risk is not really worth it
---
Yeah, I saw that when I looked it up. Such a pity.
---
because I found that after entering the abyss, there was no way back
---
Delve having 4t a month explode doesn't sound like a green zone to me.
---
it was only T1 dark, but still..
---
I was ready to die :)
---
I didn't say perfect, but from personal experience I know that it's generally pretty good.
---
Ahahhahahhahahhahahahahahhahahahaha no.
---
The bombers warp in cloaked and unless you only mine to small rocks, they will die. Yes it can be done but it‚Äôs playing Russian roulette. One day you will lose
---
I take a carebears any day over the "elite" PVP players hiding in high sec that only takes out a 50 mil ship and cries if they dont kill at least a rorq. Risk reward has always been way off for the small shit ships
---
EVE is toxic
---
He said supper. He smashed a good meal.
---
Pretty sure the OP is Atrum Venificus, could be wrong.
---
No they couldn‚Äôt, guarantee you were cloaky/nullified and able to kite people out. When things get dicey you fucking by to find another helpless VNI or myrm
---
Whs have limited escalation and strong home field advantages.  It is not a comparable to null sec, where a person can log out for a week, log back in just to light a cyno for 10 dreads to come to. 
---
K space j space have there own set of issues dont attempt to mix
---
Just what a lot of people predicted. 
---
Game is more dead now then pre-blackout.
---
I would be very curious to see what the burn down ratio is/how long new Eden could last at current supply
---
You‚Äôre trying to merge the pandemic horde story with the KF story. Both texts you mentioned are from me talking about how PH went. That has nothing to do with KF and I don‚Äôt think I argued with Toni about something that ended up with my app being tossed out
---
Is there a list of active alliance staging systems?
---
Looking to get some nullsec roaming fun but other than 1DQ I'm not familiar with where anyone else lives in terms of home/deployment.
---
You know stainguy is a typical goon krab right?
---
I'm sure this gets asked a lot, but how difficult is it to start anew in EVE at this point?
---
I played a lot back in the day (2009-2012) but don't have access to that account anymore. I've been debating on getting back into EVE for years now but didn't want to start again and got hooked on games that I really regret playing (look at you BDO).
---
I remember it taking a few months when I first started to even doing anything casually. Also, how's the player population, and nullsec wars, like compared with how they were back when I played?
---
Once you go red,
---
you never leave the bed
---
What people seem to brushing over is, CCP stated that this was the start of several changes.
---
Until we see what the future hold and what plans CCP has in store, we can't accurately comment on how it will all affect New Eden.

It's been 3 weeks, in a game that has existed for 16 years. Just sit back and hold tight

&gt;Lastly, this game is lonely could someone add me in game that doesn't mind answering a question every now and again? My char name is Gi Tugg.

When burning out of bubbles, your top speed is really important as you're only going to get one MWD burst.  The Prowler is almost as agile as a Viator, but it's definitely faster in a sprint, and that's what you want to survive.  You want the Prowler for escaping Sabres.
---
Many people who post Occator fits will make you wonder what the ship bonuses are if you don't already know. [Just look at lowsec losses.](https://zkillboard.com/ship/12745/losses/) Tons of them use istabs, WCS etc.  This is not to say that the Mastodon fits are better.  They just can be better.  A two slot tank is quite powerful, large ancil + invuln.  Using your lows for agility / speed / warp speed doesn't fight your tank.  You have enough mids to dual-prop + ECM burst so that any gate camp without quite a bit of hardware (webs, lots of long point, lots of DPS) will let you slip away from what would be certain doom otherwise, while you warp off faster than cruisers so that escaping the grid means actually escaping usually.
---
A rose by any other name...
---
Assuming perfect play, no, because you get alpha'd by 5 groups of fighters.
---
The best bet is to coordinate with more dictors, but if there's only one of you, it sounds like you did your best. The only thing I would say is to dive in and tag him with scram a few times to see if he's MWDing, and if he is, make someone tankier hold scram on him.
---
It's possible to go with a web fit to stop the super from bombing your bubbles as easily, but I don't really like it because tackling a super is kind of a rare situation and a double extender fit (for the Sabre) is much more useful in the general case.
---
1: You‚Äôre wrong. Wrether you meant July 14th or July 20th there are kills in Abyssal PvP after 13:16 and I can‚Äôt even find a killmail that happened at 13:16 either day
---
2: Even if you were right for that day, that‚Äôs ONE DAY. If you look at say, July 25th (yesterday) you find there was a total of 8 kills excluding pods. Those kills happened at the following times
---
4:10, 12:22, 12:34, 12:54, 15:29, 18:29, 18:52, and 19:07
---
Fights
---
Explain
---
wait waht was it before?
---
Yeah I scout and web with a hyena alt anyways, with a ship scanner for any moas or other suspect ships I find on gate to see if they‚Äôre tackle alts for gankers, only way I can really get caught is if I‚Äôm piss drunk and not doing it properly... or my internet cuts out at a bad time... both of which have happened :P
---
I agree what this game needs is even easier ways to kill people without consequence or effort
---
fc's/anchor in all the "hi-sec trade fighting null corps" fights would be wardecced by randoms (payed by the ppl that want to fight the null ppl in hi-sec) evertime they have a market to kill
---
You ask for faith in CCP.  When has CCP ever deserved faith?  They can't even get month to month patches done correctly without half the time screwing up so bad it nearly breaks the game.  Should we get into the testing cycle of Eve Online where players, aka the customers, do the majority of the work, to then not have any of the work market into the development cycle?  Any company who doesn't listen to the consumer feedback usually is destined to fail.  CCP can't even communicate properly to their consumer base even though they have blogs, forums, patch notes (let's not even get into the unmarked changes in these things), database comparison tools the players utilize, and a heap of other ways to get in touch with players.  The only thing CCP can get right is the meme of having a board meeting and throwing the guy who makes sense out of the window.  I have no faith in CCP, as if they didn't have a loyal customer base, this game would have failed a while ago.
---
TLDR:  CCP does not deserve blind faith.
---
What makes you say that?
---
My bad.
---
Never not.
---
The accelerator is what keeps you from getting volleyed.  When you are holding targets down for a fleet you will most definitely be primary especially if you are the only thing holding down the blingy t3.  Your reps will be melting.  What you propose may be workable but will still be less than it was.  Even if the hp/s is greater cycle time matters a lot.
---
the issue isn‚Äôt effort.  The issue is the counter to pve is f1 or bombing the first target you come across unprepared.  
---
The counter to cloak hotdrops and covops t3s is... don‚Äôt undock unless you can tank until help arrives. It has killed content because it‚Äôs one sided content
---
Lol.. whinny?
---
another great week of blackout looking forward to the weekend
---
Don't forget Fade!  I think the "renters" in Fade were at approximately 550b isk ratted past month.  Can't wait to see what they're at when the next MER is published.
---
Unfortunately the Marauders will never be a meta pick when the Colelie Carriers offer far more at similar signing prices.
---
A quick skim suggests several things it could foreshadow.
---
Capsuleer style ground forces.
---
New Loyalty Program or other payout implementation.
---
Improvement to CONCORD reaction times / response fleets / flexibility.
---
Now we are just getting ridiculous.
---
I've gotten lots of good fights due to black out, in fact it's the first time in recent memory I've been able to battleship roam and actually get some fights instead of a dread dropped on me. So I don't know what you're even talking about.  What blackout has proven to me is that carebears/goons are really good at spinning fables and shitting out words to justify its removal so they stop losing said excavators and can bring back their bots.
---
You were constantly complaining about the app process in kf public channel. If you can't see why this would lead to you getting rejected, I don't know what to tell you mate. For what it's worth, it was entertaining while it lasted.
---
*drunken roam
---
No, I do see why, but its not because of something that happened in pandemic horde AFTER I got rejected from KF -_-
---
Yeah but... the price of abyssal mats has been tanking pretty hard.
---
No but say I want to invest the sp in getting at least one industrial to V for blockade runners &amp; DST, I have to pick one, will cost a lot of sp to do them all
---
Started running abysal sites for the first time. Having a blast. Really close to banking enough to try some pvp for the first time.
---
Of course it is
---
8 mil sp for them all :/
---
I hope you don't awox me next week :)
---
"Yeah it's weird for me as a new player how everyone can see you in space"  
---
Krabspergs: OMB OBVEEASLEY DIS IS BAIT SOCKET PUPPET!!! HOW COULD A NOOOOOOB EVER COMPREHEND THE COMPLEXITY OF LOCAL CHAT TO SUCH A DEGREE! FUCKING FAKE!
---
I'll bring the popcorn
---
It's not hard to [check reaction indexes](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/costindex.php) and if the index is maxed out it means you have a nice juicy target since the inputs and outputs drop in k-space.
---
With the killing of bots, also lots of active players were chased away.
---
The t2 gallente haulers are the best especially the occator. Triple prop with quad stab works very well in lowsec, as it would need 7 points to tackle it and most people other than hics dont fit that many points to their ship.
---
Agree 100‚ÑÖ about the risk vs reward
---
If we have people around, we will always fancy a little do-si-do in Pure Blind. I hear if you jump the gate from Torrinos and warp directly to the out gate, fun things happen.  :)
---
Exactly. I think a PvE revamp would actually be healthy for the whole game, PVP included.
---
You didn't mention other uses for plex that happened during the last three years. Skill injectors and extractors were released beginning of 2016. PLEXing an account by extracting SP and takes almost 1000 PLEX. That alone could explain a huge amount of the PLEX inflation. To PLEX, you have to buy skill 4 skill extractors, you can get 10 for 1120 PLEX. Then you extract and sell the large skill injectors and use that isk to buy more PLEX. The more people injected rorqs, the more isk they had to create new rorq/super pilots, most of which also PLEXed, all using almost twice as many PLEX as before. 
---
Skins also got very popular during this time. I'm sure bots have had an effect on PLEX price, but you're missing some angles here.
---
... and your ship and implants have an isk value. Losing either is still losing isk.
---
Just hunt in low sec.... o yeah i forgot you snuffed that out with all your titan drops...
---
I only started exploring abyssals yesterday, so I'm still impressed
---
Which were introduced what, 5 years ago?
---
The blackout is.
---
I am 100% gonna get triggered listening to this
---
Incorrect, watch physics of eve online, the "thrusters" in the back are not thrusters at all üòä
---
Vacation next week dudes, not sure where yet - hopefully eatern eu, possibly us national Forest or s America. We shall see.
---
I suspect whole coalitions are going to get triggered listening to this ;)
---
Because PLEX price is an indicator of everything else. With the billions of variables every type of economy has, people use posterchildren as indicators for larger shifts/changes.
---
Like every posterchild, some are more accurate than others
---
Hahahaha
---
Man, reading through this thread and comments was great. This community can be one of the best in gaming. It's been said before, but go check out E-Uni. Their process to join is a little tedious, but worth the hassle. I did it about 5 years ago when I started out, still flying with some of the guys I met there.
---
wasnt this for release on sunday?
---
Huh, i hadn't run the numbers. About 60 m3/sec with miner 2s vs 200 m3/sec with excavs. Still better than a covetor at about 40 m3/sec with boosts. Rorq is also nearly infinitely more survivable. Way cheaper to lose 5 mil in drones than covetors too or 2.5 bil in excavs. Wow, thanks friendly goon. Don't have to face hump rocks now either because they are way faster and who cares if they die in transit. This made my day. 
---
Welp, time to refit the fleet and change extra alts from defender missile training back to rorq training to make up for lost efficiency. Thanks again.
---
I don't think this is as big of a deal as you are all making it out to be. If you want your old style of ratting, you can just move to low sec. You might be getting a bit of a haircut in doing so, but life goes on.
---
Good for you, sounds actually fun (and similar to the enjoyment we get from J space communities) rather than asocial solo ratting.
---
(‚úø‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø) gonna chill and cook some steaks this weekend! (‚úø‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
(‚úø‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø) hope you all have an amazing weekend, stay safe out there! (‚úø‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
Aw jeez man, 2h. Can someone spoonfeed me the cliffnotes please?
---
Would it really kill you to stop being such a spodbrain for five minutes and go do some PVP with it instead?
---
This pls, aint got time to listen to 2 hours of stuff :(

---
Good
---
Krabs need to adapt but at the moment they're just trying to wait it out and hope CCP reinstates local. Though CCP does need to rebalance some of the other memey ways to make a lot of cheap ISK quickly (abyssals? FW missions?) because the risk/reward min-maxers still have some high reward low risk places to go, at least until too many of them try to do it and crash the markets.
---
Isn't the ikitursa a superior ship now though?
---
You old fart is the only one offended here judging by your response. But don't get angry grandpa or you may have a heart attack. Don't worry though, l will make sure tho drop a cargo container in your memory in space when you hit the bucket.
---
P.s. You are the reason game is dead and ccp is struggling economicly. If this game were more action packed instead of looking and feeling like a browser game, player count would have been close to million. Proven by every other game not targeted towards excel sheet nerd 35 years old joes.
---
I have a better plan. All three of them GTFOH and let someone more competent run this game.
---
I suspect not.
---
Somebody hurry up and give tldw
---
These types of articles give clues about upcoming mechanic changes, the storyline moving forward, or the announcement of new projects.
---
TL;DR: 
---
&gt; On Monday, we‚Äôll be making a few changes:
---
&gt;         
---
&gt; * New recruits will receive more Skill Points from the program.
---
&gt; * Reward one will replace reward three and be doubled for the recruiter.
---
&gt; * Reward two will be changed to give omega time instead of PLEX for the recruiter.
---
&gt; When these changes are implemented, the rewards will stand as follows:
---
&gt; * New recruits will receive 1,000,000 skill points (increased from 750,000).
---
&gt; * Recruiter will receive 4x 24h accelerators when their recruit purchases PLEX.
---
&gt; * Recruiter will receive 15 days of Omega time when their recruit purchases Omega time.
---
that's awesome stuff. i like what i hear
---
I think he was implying that your app was thrown out because you're an unpleasant, needlessly argumentative person, not because you argued specifically with a PH director.
---
15 minutes in- Make null more chaotic
---
The problem is current Eve PvE doesn‚Äôt incentivize group PvE at all(other than incursions) payout/loot/difficulty doesn‚Äôt scale with fleet size.
---
It would be super fucking cool to have variable anoms that scale based on fleet size/composition.
---
Ah, yea probably. I do have a bad tendency to argue a lot :/
---
&gt; You have to be next to the ship in person to use the vat bays.
---
No. You have to be beside the rorq/titan to install a clone, but you can jump to the rorq/titan anywhere in k-space as long as the clone vat bay is active.
---
And what you're describing is the original design philosophy of the titan as a mobile station and the rorqual as a mobile mining platform. The meta of the game just never went that way because the value of doing something like that was dwarfed by the inherent risk of moving titans and rorquals around.
---
[Lets roll back to three years ago](https://i.imgur.com/7frnn2x.jpg) when the "watchlist" was a thing and you could get an instant notification when ever any pilot of your choice logged in. You can bet that every known titan pilot (because keepstars came out at about the same time that the watchlist was removed) was on a watchlist for every group around. So the idea of sneaking a titan around was laughable.
---
As for rorquals, deploying a 5 man mining barge operations around the cluster was just never worth doing since mining barges are cheap, stations existed, ice belts didn't deplete (until Odyssey? I forget), and asteroid belts were not in short supply.
---
With the way the game is now, you make your push into an area using astrahuses, fortizars, and (if you're bold enough) keepstars. If you want to get sneaky, you can blops bridge a flotilla of blockade runners carrying packaged cruisers. Deploy a POS and an SMA in in an hour you have an attack force deployed behind enemy lines for a fraction of the cost of a titan.
---
&gt; If a titan sneaked in behind enemy lines
---
I'm just gonna quote that here for posterity. You'd have a dead titan.
---
Listening to it and I'll type interesting quotes with timestamps.   
---
02:25 - Hilmar: "We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years" - (DAU/MAU = Daily/Monthly active users).
---
I don't rat but thanks for the suggestion. Did you bother reading my post at all?
---
Constant changes - A chaos era of EvE Online.
---
TL;DL?
---
Question is will the new recruits receive 1m SP directly? Or will it be another claimable item?
---
Currently, a lot of people spin up dozens of new accounts, and train a few indy/trade skills and a sprinkle of random skills until 5m SP. Then, they're able to claim the 750k SP and sell those accounts as SP farms
---
That's basically what I'm suggesting
---
Bring ALL THE SALT!!
---
It's the most expensive fuel per unit, though. Amarr wins out on fuel economy because theirs is super cheap and it only just barely uses more than the Nomad.
---
For T2 haulers, all DSTs are equal. The Viator (gallente) is the best blockade runner except the Prowler (Minmatar) can be fit to align 1 second faster (cause server ticks)
---
In the world of Jump Freighters, Amarr fuel is the cheapest.
---
But in the world of T1 haulers there is the hoarder which can carry ammo so its a great thing to stick in the SMB of a capital.
---
The limited one has no NPCs and you can dodge the damage so yeah you can do that in any exploration ship.
---
Da Real MVP
---
He says with shock, as they give away many free skill points just for longing in......
---
Can be a bit, ye. But If You're fascinated by it, then by all means : )
---
No people, no plex bought by people, no isk to buy plex, no bots to be had. IS that it?
---
[don't mind me, i'm just doing the ccp is bad meme and have nothing constructive to offer]
---
teach me sensai
---
I'd focus on training scanning skills, and try to probe for gas sites in low sec. You can earn about 30m-40m per hour huffing cytoserocin in a Venture. Other people can't bother you unless they probe down the site as well, giving you a bit of warning (you can detect probes using the directional scanner).. 
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gas\_cloud\_harvesting](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gas_cloud_harvesting)
---
I can't even believe that first once since we can tell how many people are logged in. And they have login bonuses right now so that can't really be a valid measurement.
---
You must be a miner with 5 rorqs who can't mine safely anymore.  How is your day cutie pie?
---
Then take gallente to 4 and minmatar to 5.
---
You have the same fighting options to fight gankers hell you have more because now your fleet can be in system this means you don't have to depend on a titan bridge. 
---
If anything removing local is a removal of the power of tackle + cyno as it's no longer the only way to hide your numbers until you have point.
---
Suitonia is providing time stamps as he listens in the top comment!
---
They leave system as we start looking for em and are long gone by time we realise theyve slinked off. Blackout ruins subcap pvp outright
---
Call them Testies it's much better.
---
I haven‚Äôt even listened to it yet, but the salt level in these comments already has me excited. Reinforcing that it‚Äôs needed.
---
Exactly crediting that to the black out is either a lie or disingenuous.

This was the expected result. Now we still need to deal with the imbalances, like cynos. Nothing has changed because CCP didnt fix anything.
---
&gt;To me it's feeling worse than it was pre blackout and we are not even one month in. 
---
Were you one of those who thought ratters would just keep coming back despite getting ganked again and again?

---
What little guy, like all the "little guy's" are blue to some major bloc nearby or effectively blue because that's the only way for them to stay alive already.
---
This is what a lot of people feared. CCP will ignore reality and cherry pick data when it suits them and then turn around and go by the actual adjusted numbers when it does not.
---
They aren't Grayscale, Fozzie, or Rise...
---
(„Å£Àò –∑(Àò‚å£Àò )
---
Its not, its just CCP doing what they do best, picking numbers they like and acting like those are the only ones that matter.
---
Its easy to start anew. It took me a few months, but I didn't really know what I was doing. Since you played back then, it shouldn't be more than a few days to a week to get your bearings and get up to speed. If you're going for caps or T2 stuff you'll still have the regular train times. NS activity has been getting quite interesting with the blackout and wormholes are still fun. I DONT know too much on the NS wars side since I stay in wormholes, but the wars are still happening
---
Plenty of those kind of games that you'd Ike this one to be around kiddo. Name one that has lasted for 16 years. I'll wait.
---
The most apparent thing to me is the allusions to the upcoming successor project to DUST 514 being Project Nova.
---
I wouldnt say its only free skill points though. Im a new player, just started, because i like the idea of getting in at a time of chaos. I feel it will provide more opportunity for me than coming in when everything is so structured from years of play. Im sure im not the only one.
---
It's being an arm chair developer to say, giving something away to encourage people to login, increases login numbers?
---
I'm now runing T2 dark no problem in this, will try T3 maybe as well
---
\[Garmur\]
---
Shadow Serpentis 1MN Afterburner

---
Nothing constructive to add? Any ideas how to reverse the trend while keeping the new blackout status quo in place so the farming of pve'ers can continue luring out roaming gangs?
---
"  make the game easier for new players " 
---
yeah that's not what blackout does, its makes it easier for me the vet to fuck them up without them having any idea i'm coming, but that's not what I'd consider making the game easier for new players... Once again hilmar sees and hears what he wants to even if its a fantasy in his own head.
---
Nah, the bots were already tethered on the citadel in system as soon as you jumped in because their Intel posts from 1 system away from the cloaky eyes on gate that sits there 23/7. You could find an anomaly on the edges of the system to drop a bubble on and log-off camp. Sometimes that worked.
---
Yes, bored people will do anything to get some kills. Have seen people in t3c with full officer smartbombs on lowsec gate.
---
&gt;it was both our opinions that joining one of the big coalitions was going to be the only way we will be able to begin mining/ratting again without a high risk of losing what we trained and worked so hard to learn to fly and the isk to fit. 
---
So now the blob grows bigger.
---
This is what people get for thinking players should fix bots.
---
I think the devs and those who implemented this had that in mind.
---
I‚Äôm 99% sure if someone wasn‚Äôt going to login initially, wouldn‚Äôt login anyways
---
Coming from someone who missed last event due to irl stuff,  I have a feeling CCP is closely monitoring a lot of statistics involved with this blackout
---
&gt; you need to take stress medicine to keep focused, that is the chaos era, and it is on
---
My body is ready.
---
This is soooooo EVE's mid-life crisis phase...
---
I've never welped a frieghter... But I've welped all sorts of stuff preventing myself from doing it
---
You're totally right. Nobody would expect someone scanning their wrecks to want to kill them. 
---
These probes would be totally unfair and fuck over ratters even more
---
what exactly would you do in your newly acquired pocket?
---
Delayed local is irrelevant. Getting caught by anything is a death sentence.
---
If people dont know they can rely on something, they will not rely on it.
---
No I wasnt one of them but I figured the majority of them would play it safe by using alts to watch their in gates, or fit stabs, etc. I wasn't expecting so many to throw in the towel so easily.
---
Honestly removing it now would not help at all because it made the barrier for new players almost impossible to overcome ( like the amount of cap pilots in the game right now means if the removed injecting tomorrow all it will do is prevent tomorrow's pilots from flying caps ) this means the gap between established and not established would be so massive there is no point in starting. 
---
CCP dug themselves a massive hole with skill injectors and i suspect it's one they can't easily get out off.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
I was a cap pilot (carrier) during The Initiative vs Goons wars, but sitting in a station and sending out fighters turned out the be really boring. So I shifted to work on the T3 cruiser (already had some T2 Battleships).
---
I don't have time for the nullsec politics right now. Was just looking for something to mess around and solo. Is there anything that makes good isk anymore that doesn't require wormholes/nullsec? I remember being able to farm machariel blueprints on the weekend and finance my monthly plex with a few hours of ratting per month.
---
What was CCPs stated goal?
---
Man you're retarded they never said that goal was accomplished only that it's one of them
---
The implication here is that the login rates are higher than before because of blackout, casually ignoring the current login bonuses. That's tainted data and ccp is using it pass narrative.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Cep1NQj.png
---
Damn dude i would have totally preferred 4 cerebral accelerators instead of an extractor :(
---
But wait also does this mean that they are reducing the total number of rewards per recrutee that you get since the accelerators are becoming a different reward and i'm not seeing a replacement reward?
---
i got a really thrilling kill on a very elusive loki pilot in our space. one of the few kills in my eve career i can really call "my own" as opposed to being a tag-along or apart of an f1 blob. it all started when i was scouring around for good battlecruiser fits for solo/small gang pvp, and happened upon a good [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fittings/comments/80kfyg/idiotproof_brawling_fits_for_every_t1/) here, where [OP posted his fit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fittings/comments/80kfyg/idiotproof_brawling_fits_for_every_t1/dv33ju2/) for a triple repping myrmidon, thanks /u/ZamielTheGrey!!! i tweaked it a bit (3x meta 4 blasters in the highs as opposed to 2 t2s and an empty high slot, which just required a 1% power grid implant to make work) and i started using it for roaming around the home region to fight off enemy small gangs roaming our space or hunting our ratters/miners.
---
i had lost the myrmidon to a gang consisting of a cynabal, loki, and two retributions when i threw it at them to try to keep them aggressed and wait for some alliance mates to get on grid. tanked them very well but i forgot to consume my exile booster which most definitely would've saved me, and let me finish off the one retribution i had into low armor already. gfs in local and i went and bought a new one.
---
a few days later this one particular loki pilot is making his daily ritual incursion into our space. he's notoriously risk averse and slippery, often goes for vnis and excavs. so i got the idea to give the guy a false sense of my myrmidon being vulnerable, and named it "shield ratting 2", which i assumed might get him to think i was a dumb ratter using the myrmidon like a vni replacement what with the recent nerfs.
---
so with the report of his location, i warped to the gate lackadaisically to make it look like i was enroute to do some krabbin'. Loki was at a perch on the gate, i jumped through and waited a bit in alignment to the next gate to see if he followed, which he did. i warped off to the next gate and waited a sec to see him land, jumped through again and decloaked to align to another gate and waited. sure enough he came through and boxed me up as fast as he could, which is all that i could've hoped for! the myrm fit was designed to just bearhug people to death, so i aligned it at him, popped mwd.
---
i had fleet mates inbound to assist, as we were effectively hunting him as was our usual affair when he came into our turf, a lone atron. he jumped in after him and suicide scrammed the loki long enough to turn off his mwd and let my slow space-boomerang get into scram+web range. once i had him locked down, the atron and a navy slicer that joined in as well both died honorably to secure my bearhug on the loki who was already raging in local about the situation, calling us "ram noob" and that we should "l2p". with my two frigate bros off the field leaving me and him alone, his guns started volleying into my "Shield Ratting 2" myrmidon to reveal that it was most definitely not a shield-fit ratting ship once he hit my armor.
---
i had been telling myself consciously since i'd undocked to not to forget to pop boosters, which i did as he'd redboxed me. the warm pulsating green glow of my reppers started up, and a huge volley took me to half armor. it worried me a bit because i hadn't realized this guy could hit me so hard still but my reppers didn't let me down and i was back to full before the next volley. it looked like my repping was stabilizing just fine as my hammerheads and blasters chewed through his shield buffer and started sealing his fate. all i was doing was making sure my cap boosters kept my reppers green. cycling down my ancillary repper when it ran out of paste. going to reload it, i realized i had made a grievous error of not having spare paste in my cargohold which made me a bit nervous. my fleet mates cheering me on and urging me to hold fast that help was on the way, to make sure i got him good. i knew he had resigned himself to his doom when he was spending his final moments yelling in local as his loki's armor started to disappear. i kept calm and overheated the two other reppers and my blasters and watched with excited disbelief as his loki hit structure and soon exploded all together!
---
despite his rage, i gave him a gf in local and was over the moon with myself at having done what was described to me by my alliance mates as "it's like you went on your first fishing trip and caught a 30 pound fish", which made my night.

---
all of which took place over the course of maybe a minute but time was moving much more slowly than that. I'm still stoked about this awesome kill, and ever-reminded about why i love this game, and my newfound space-friends in TEST.
---
Protip: 
---
you can't flairbait as horde. 
---
You just become Horde.
---
It's a paradox. 
---
Horde spai alts are still Horde. 
---
Horde flairbaiters are still Horde. 
---
Welcome.
---
Yeah, this could NEVER have been predicted. Nope. Not a fucking chance. /s
---
Can't get valid data if you don't control the variables.
---
&gt;Improving the isk/hour is a terrible idea.
---
Absolutely. If space is considered "safe" by some metric, rewards need to go down.
---
yeah but under the assumption of both reps running we're talking about a difference of ~0.7seconds between cycles and i honestly believe its much more likely to get into a situation where the increased sustained tank will save you than into one where 0.7 seconds save you from being volleyd.
---
Wormholes fixed this to an extent.
---
Again, I‚Äôm sure when they measure DAU and MAU it‚Äôs much more than your perceived indication from the logged in players
---
Such as how long the account the account is logged, did it undock, was there player interactions with the market
---
I‚Äôm sure my list can go on, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the devs are keeping note of all this
---
Which is exactly why they did it. They released a change (drifters) that killed nullsec content leading to lower log ins, followed that with blackout, leading to up to 4K fewer players at peak. Then turn around and off a discount on 3 month memberships as well as over a month straight of free SP, then point at the graphs and claim the highest level of participation ever even as people playing in nullsec are beginning to talk about what a ghost town it has become. Typical Hilmar.
---
They have given away plenty of sp in the past year, hard to say that its this login event that has caused the highest login count in 5 years.
---
Depends how they define an active user.
---
Yes because we have no idea how CCP is looking at the data. They could only be counting players who stay logged in after a certain time.
---
Sure, but also they didn't say login rates or logins, or logged in users.
---
Full quote:      
---
"Blackout is accomplishing their goals for this year, one of those goals is to make the game easier for new players"  
---
Yeah he did say that, you're the retard.
---
Holy fucking shit can anyone back up the bot theory!? No you can't! Such bullshit, players are leaving en mass and these morons keep saying bots!!! How can people be so damn stupid.
---
Sounds like every man's dream. =D
---
login bonuses only matter if the players see a future in the game.
---
You can... it's just harder. I'm reminded of the game Mastermind. Changing variables one by one is ultimately a losing strategy (in that game) compared to changing multiple variables at once and cross-referencing between iterations. Given CCP's stated goal of shaking things up, the multiple changes + iterate + cross-reference approach seems quite appropriate.
---
Totally agree, 3 mid slot is horrible on amarr Cr
---
You have to do a fast form ( especially with your ticker ) given you corp mates gave you a reputation for hell dunks people tend to not sit around all that long waiting for you to form these up. 
---
But really like engaging a 5 man fleet should not take you more then a 30 seconds to form up a response, and be either burning the couple of jumps or in system.
---
Lots of hurf and blurf from CCP. Don't get me wrong, I like the roadmap they are putting out. But we have all heard this just one too many time in the past. So I am hopefull but also going to see what actually rolls out. 
---
For what it is worth, I am back to daily logins instead of once every 3-5 days.
---
They want to make EVE more dangerous and more chaotic.
---
Black out doesn't affect new players, because new players aren't in nullsec.
---
And by chaos, you mean raping what's left of the fan base with micro transactions lol
---
Good to know we got 16 more years before EvE breaks a hip
---
&gt; CCP will ignore reality and cherry pick data
---
Its not like they have a history of that or anything /s
---
It's entirely possible that you're correct.  Will test against high volley weapon systems.
---
There's a pretty big difference between accomplishing and accomplished just like there is in finishing and finished
---
Are you sure you're even a human with basic intellect?
---
I ahevn‚Äôt olayed in a while and even then I‚Äôm in mid-tier ships, but a chaos era might just drag me back in
---
Stop getting butthurt because your cap umbrella is going to crumble soon.
---
CCP needs to keep encouraging and rewarding this type of play style. This is what makes EVE the greatest game ever made!  
---
Little advice... Keep building on this momentum and when you're ready, drop the goon banner and become proper independent.
---
IS there any way to get a friend onto your recruitment program after they made the account?
---
I just didn't think about this when recommending the game.
---
i resubbed because of the stuff happening around Drifters/blackout/trigs looked like theres finally a shakeup, after a year of winning eve. i'm pretty sure a lot of people feel the same atm - nope, i dont think it's just because of the SP ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Highest DAU/MAU really? I am checking every day eve offline and I do not think there was rise in active players.
---
As someone who's been playing 'skill que online' for the last year or so I can tell you the only reason I've been logging in for the last week is for the free skill point. I watch here to see if there are any specials on anything and take advantge of whatever they are running. I can't seem to get myself to play lately though. Every time I do actually play I have fun though. I'm looking forward to some new things.
---
&gt; Constant changes 
---
Dunno, I'd like the promised balance changes and tiercide first.
---
*the only you know of
---
As usual, CCP doesnt seem to want to fix anything.
---
I'm looking to do faction warfare for the first time. Fairly experienced pilot. Looking to make isk profit from running L4 missions. 
---
First. I hear there is profitability of 1bil/hour. Is that still true?
---
I'm looking to join Minmatar so next question is the standard still a T3C? jackdaw I hear?? And if so can someone provide a good fit?
---
Lastly is there any missions I should be avoiding or it doesn't matter?
---
Those are assumptions. And they wouldnt affect any more than if a regular person was buying PLEX. And in nowhere near those volumes.
---
Well thats true. But its on niche items so wont affect the general populace.
---
But, PLEX isnt a bot thing. I get why you are arguing for it but its really not that connected. Skillfarms are however, they eat massive amounts of PLEX. This is rather well known effect.
---
Only if we agree that mine explodes in a lot of fun
---
You sound as if you have enough experience in space that you would be a good fit with us. We're Dreddit, the largest corporation in Test Alliance Please ignore. We do a lot of small gangs and love taking out people who are inexperienced at PVP.
---
http://www.dredditisrecruiting.com/
---
Why cut off an entire section of the game? Let the guy find his own way and do what he wants. Sometimes it's not about the isk/hr
---
&gt; Make it easier for new bros and harder for bitter vets.
---
It's almost like they've never heard of Malcanis' law.
---
Can confirm, I'm new and terrible, and they're nice to me.
---
New players dont tend to pay attention to local or dscan, or use any intel tools. They also don't tend to jump right into null. The blackout means that the ones who do have marginally better survivability and *much* better chances of finding a fight. 
---
Won't be a fight they're likely to win, but content is content.
---
Mainly by not using that abomination.
---
No no don't you know we are all privy to exactly what CCP are looking at, you're just out of the loop.
---
They've done these sorts of events for the past 3 years. Summer of 2016 was the first time I can remember daily SP for exactly the same thing, shooting some rats.
---
Now Hilmar, *this*, I think, deserves an applause.
---
My recent average has been 100m/hour in null.
---
unfortunately this is Eve, so no promises kind sir ;)
---
You can move your assets into safety in the personal assets ( right click-&gt; move to assets safety)
---
Ya but how do you measure that, why not measure one thing at a time. They did subscription sales, login bonuses, blackout, daily quests, drifter attacks on null and who knows what else at the same time. The data is all tainted and can't be used reliably.
---
What about new skins that I can buy with real money man? Can we have some news about the most important aspect of Eve?
---
yes ill just flash form and get a ping to the entire alliance to get people to form quick from 1dq, or more likely ill hear someone is tackled get everyone to grab a ship then have to make several jumps and a jump bridge to get to them get in system and start scanning and whislt im filtering out all the blues and the like the gankers have already slinked off enjoying their risk free ganks and ive wasted everyones time because we cant pursue them out of our space because theyre already gone.
---
That is simply not true.  All the biggest new player organizations are out of null these days.  KF, Brave, Horde, etc are all null based and have been for years.
---
twitch.tv/ticklemyshoess
---
will be streaming more again in august as life has me pretty busy atm
---
Highest July login. We can't actually see online user count is down, but by God knows what metric ccp is using they say it's up.
---
I didn't finish reading but did you mean blackout actually introduced more botting??
---
Oh well  (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
---
Well, the main points are they would like to cater to new players and make the game chaotic for veterans.
---
Activity in nullsec is higher than in the last 5 years of Eve's history (interesting comment) 
---
Huge changes every week.
---
Basically if you enjoy chaos in your life, you will love the coming eve
---
Yes, make the game completely unpredictable and remove all continuity.  That will let players plan for the future and build empires.
---
Without local, you can sneak into territories that are off the beaten path and nobody will bother you. People take notice when they enter a seemingly empty system with 30 pilots in local. 
---
That being said, if you place a fort you should make sure it is out of D-Scan range from the gate routes in system. 
---
Forts are priority targets compared to smaller stuff.
---
Lol, are everyone just running the same narrative believing it will somehow change facts? Nobody is denying that u get fights but understand that the game is bigger than u. Not everything is personal but read what I wrote and look at data I point to and its in general a pretty straightforward conclusion.
---
"But no, Im special". 
---
Besides, I have no way of knowing if you are actually telling the truth and where you got these fights. But people are suddenly thinking that blackout is the reason why they are getting fight against other gangs. It never was, you are getting fights because you are now at the same place at the same time with the wish to fight eachother. No local didnt cause it, the change in your behaviour did.
---
I.e., small gang not getting fights isnt a NS problem, its a small gang problem.
---
Some were.  Others were supers and carriers that sure as hell did.  One omega super is more than 6x the income of a pre-nerf alpha VNI.
---
Hilmar's been huffing chaotic filaments.
---
There is no more or less chaos right now.  This is a farce and for all of the large blocks nothing has changed.
---
he's just posting what mittens is telling them to post. There's no critical thinking involved
---
I need to start going back to Brave space. Maybe they've stopped dropping supers on every frigate gang by now.
---
5 rorqs is the safest way to mine right now lol. Especially of he joins a big group
---
Maybe they mainly focussed on the goal while caring less about what exactly plays how much of a part to achieve it. And it sounds like they did achieve it.
---
Unless you're wrong about what data they wanted.
---
They want to know if they can still make people log in.  
---
The answer is yes.  Emphatically actually.
---
&gt; 64 bit client suprising adoption rate and better than expected. 
---
I'd be more surprised if the takeup rate *wasn't* high; any advantage you can get.
---
So the skillpoint giveaways are like viagra?
---
That‚Äôs a problem by itself that the place that‚Äôs supposed to be the most difficult to survive in is where new players are expected to go.
---
Here's a quick auto-transcribe of the entire thing. Doesn't have speaker labels, but you can read through what was said at least: https://pastebin.com/kXc1S1Fp
---
Not less (or more) than 12 isk. You killed that poor alliance, you meanie.
---
&gt; The implication here is that the login rates are higher than before because of blackout
---
So I'm still listening to this but nowhere in it does he say that the higher log in count is strictly due to the black out.  Granted i still have an hour and a half left but I started listening right pretty shortly after it dropped and I'm not sure what the fuck gave you this idea.
---
This is a series of changes put into the game to see if they can shake things up and make people log in, but you are laser focused on only one of those things.
---
Oh ye most def. But its far from enough to singlehandedly cause that much PLEX inflation. Skillfarms are the main culprits when it comes to that.
---
Botting in general, I mean I get why people dislike it, I do to. But its not as big of an issue imo. Its certainly not the reason behind Eves biggest problems so removing it wont actually fix Eve. But pro local supporters are throwing it around constantly and its meh at best.
---
Soon(tm)
---
A certain Delve based coalition seems to already be getting triggered here

AAR:
---
We were out seeing what we could find to fight and one of our hunters stumbled across the Hel. Our dictors got it bubbled and our Kikimora fleet was in close by. Not much to tell beyond that, we landed as you can see the Hel didn't have much of a tank.
---
The  heroes in this bit was our FC and our hunters who were on the ball.
---
&gt; For instance, bots who are alpha accounts are driving PLEX prices up?
---
He left some things out.  For example, it's not purely bots, it's a reduction in mass multi-boxing.  People that used to safely run 5 Rorquals 99% AFK cannot do so anymore and that is lowering demand for PLEX.  I am one of these people.  I generally have up to 9 accounts PLEX'd.  I have half that PLEX'd at the moment.
---
Thanks for the response. I'll keep you in mind while I figure out what to do
---
Niuce!
---
&gt; This is what a lot of people feared. CCP will ignore reality and cherry pick data 
---
I'm having to post this a lot, you don't work there, how do you know what data they're even looking for?  You assume its one thing but what if its not?  You're laser focused on the removal of local as the only change they're using to collect data but what if you're really really really wrong and they're looking at it from a different perspective for a different reason?
---
This is the problem with most of you who sperge out in these threads, they're not approaching the problem the way you would, for the reasons you want them to, so you run around with your head on fire screaming about how wrong they are.
---
You need to be more critical of them for the things they provably do wrong and speculate less.
---
Thanks for the resource recommendation. I'll look into it
---
As  a returning player, this excites me.  I loved the heart pounding risk that was involved in the game.
---
As i said, both things can achieve saving you. The important part is which one does it more often. (On a side note personally i still am a big fan of the tracking but i think the main use i see for the ship for me is a different one than the one you seem to aim at.)
---
Instead of just my regular 2 omega accounts, I omega'd a 3rd and logged in my other 4 that are now alpha. Gotta get that free SP. They only got logged in for long enough to claim rewards, but they count as logins.
---
&gt; There is no more or less chaos right now. This is a farce and for all of the large blocks nothing has changed.
---
I would disagree with this completely. I have personally been in a few fights that never would have occurred without blackout.
---
Just look at the excavator kills for the last month for an easy metric. It is over 5x higher than any time earlier this year.
---
&gt; 34:35 - CCP Falcon - the MER for July and August will look very bizarre due to the Blackout. Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data, it's incredible to see activity is still there. ISK generated from bounties is down massively, but that player activity is still there it has just shifted to other activities as players have adapted. We believe blackout has a been a massive success.
---
Thanks. I wasnt sure how this worked, so it's good to know
---
Prices will go up! Ratters won't be able to print big ISK unless they have good coordination and intelligence. If your playstyle doesn't include those things, Hi-sec/Low-sec ratting is still a thing.
---
Yeah, it was small gang heavy tackle and solo roam for me before the drone speed nerf for me.
---
Im coming from a fresh wormhole that spawned directly in system.
---
&gt;Exactly crediting that to the black out is either a lie or disingenuous.
---
Well, it depends on how they're tracking "active users". If your four alts who have been idling training skills for the last 6 months who you're now logging into to claim those daily points are counted towards MAU, then yeah, it's disingenuous. However, CCP is not a public company and they have no need to lie to themselves like that. If MAU is tracking email addresses as the unique identifier, or if it's weighted with actual subscriber totals, then the skill point bonuses don't play into that as much.
---
I resubbed two accounts as blackout news started coming out after not having played the game in seven years. I did not resub because of skill point bonuses.
---
Im absolutely shocked over the fact that the login event in any way is tainting the numbers. Its almost as if CCP wanted to say blackout is great and introduced a mechanic for it.
---
Yep, bailed out of the site when the NPC police showed up, or when probes popped up on DSCAN. Then I was out like a light back down the chain and off somewhere else.
---
/Hidden arrives and whispers in your ear.... Dont do it, resist..........\*the voices fades away\*
---
black out doesn't effect new players because they never had the broken intel to begin with, so they'll learn the environment that exists *right now*.  
---
Any new player headed out to 0.0 is generally also joining one of the existing blocks through Karmafleet, Brandnew Bros, or Pandemic Horde, so your posturing is dishonest, since Goons are also constantly crowing about how the only people safe during the black out are those exact same groups.
---
What about people who resubbed because of the mct sale, and what about people who quit because of drifters?
---
I believe the stated goal is to experiment and find out how we react
---
Yet we see 1000 less players logged in at any point.
---
Very true. I'm a new player, there is absolutely no point in me going to nullsec because there is zero chance of me winning a fight with an experienced player at a gate camp. I might as well stay inside and reprocess my ship.
---
Frig sites offer 3x the payout of the comparable Cruiser sites (T1 vrs T1 for example) because they are designed to be run by 3 people. 
---
For low skill ISK Blitzing T1s in a Frig isnt bad money as it would be the equivalent of running 3 Cruiser T1s.
---
/u/naxxus_crowe repost from an earlier post
---
First order of business when starting the game: it will toss you into a string of tutorials which will teach you a few different aspects of the game. 
---
One of the first things to do, is to go to the social tab on the left side ‚Äúneocom‚Äù (the left hand bar with all the menu‚Äôs) and click on chat channels. Join a chat channel called z-s overview. 
---
Click each of the layouts in that chat channel starting with core and then grab all the packs, then 1 of the layout packs. What this will do is improve your Overview (the big panel on the right hand side). The overview holds all in space content for you. It‚Äôs the main interface for you to attack another player, an NPC or interact with things like gates. 
---
After completing the tutorial, i would recommend looking into and joining one of these player corporations. Some of them offer free skillbooks and sometimes even ships. 
---
Pandemic Horde
---
Karmafleet
---
EVE University
---
Pandemic Horde is a group which lives in the NE corner of NS, in a region called The Kalevala Expanse. They‚Äôre allied with other large nullsec groups in the north. A lot of people roam to them because they can get fights from them, so you‚Äôll get a lot of PvP content if you want. 
---
Karmafleet is a group which is a member of The Imperium. You may also know this group as Goons or Goonswarm. They live in Delve, which is a region in the SW of the map. They are allied with other groups near them, and the space they live in is considered to be the safest space in the game for PvE ISK Making. It‚Äôs easy to make money here, but can be hard to PvP outside of bigger fleets. 
---
EVE University is exactly what it sounds like. A group which has different ‚Äúcampuses‚Äù and will provide player made classes and tutorials to help you learn EVE. You don‚Äôt need to join this to be successful,  I didn‚Äôt and personally it‚Äôs not my cup of tea.
---
Once you‚Äôre on the way to joining a player corporation (if you‚Äôre interested, r/evejobs will also have other corps you can look into, your experience may vary though) you should be looking into what kind of skills you should be training. There are 14 skills which are useful no matter what ship you fly, but don‚Äôt grant you the ability to fly bigger ships with bigger weapon systems. 
---
My recommendation as an alpha is to train to a specific weapon system and tank type. Once you know what you want to train, train towards that. Each faction uses different tank/weapon types. You can view the factions using the ship tree to make a decision. Early on, you‚Äôll be flying frigates, destroyers and cruisers. Anything bigger costs a lot more SP and to fly it well you‚Äôll need more SP. you can fly Frig/Dessie‚Äôs/Cruisers with very little SP and still be effective. 
---
Keep in mind that Energy Weapons/Hybrid Weapons and Projectile Weapons all share Gunnery support skills, Missiles use Missile skills and Drones use Drone skills. 
---
The weapon systems are as follows:
---
Hybrid Weapons: 
---
** Blasters **
---
* Short Range High DPS High tracking (they apply well!). Uses Capacitor. Locked to Kin/Therm Damage Type
---
** Railguns **
---
* Long Range Low DPS Low Tracking. Uses Capacitor. Locked to Kin/Therm Damage Type
---
Projectile Weapons: 
---
** Autocannons ** 
---
* Short Range Moderate DPS High Tracking. No Capacitor Use. Selectable damage types. 
---
** Artillery **
---
* Long Range High Alpha Moderate DPS Low Tracking. No Capacitor Use. Selectable damage types. 
---
Energy Weapons
---
** Pulse Lasers **
---
* Mid tier Range High DPS Good Tracking. Uses Capacitor. Locked to EM/Thermal damage types. 
---
** Beam Lasers **
---
* Long Range High DPS Low Tracking. Locked to EM/Thermal damage types. 
---
Missiles 
---
* Rockets - fit to frigates and destroyers, Low Range moderate DPS launchers with Low application. Only good on a few bonused hulls. 
---
* Light Missiles Probably one of the best early game skills to train for Caldari line ships, used on the caracal and other Rapid Light Missiles Launchers and Light Missile Launchers.
---
* Heavy Missiles - Made for cruisers and up, these are slower missiles which have worse application but do more damage per volley than Light Missiles. They also have long range. They‚Äôre not the best right now. These fit Cruisers and Battlecruisers. Rapid Heavy Missile Launchers fit to battleships. 
---
* Heavy Assault Missiles Fit to cruisers and battlecruisers, these missiles have better application and damage then heavy missiles but much less range. 
---
* Torpedoes If you plan on becoming an omega, these are an excellent weapon system for use on bombers (a stealthy frigate which can use these battleship sized launchers). High damage, slow, with medium range. Bad application. 
---
* Cruise Missiles extremely Long Range missiles with high damage and bad application. Battleship Weapons. 
---
Drones
---
** Light ** 
---
* Small and very fast, Low HP. Selectable Damage Types. 5 Mb/s
---
** Medium ** 
---
* Bigger, More damage, but slower than lights. Selectable Damage Types. 10 Mb/s
---
** Heavy ** 
---
* Bigger, more damage but very very slow. Selectable Damage Types. 25Mb/s
---
** Sentry **
---
* Immobile ‚Äúturrets‚Äù that stay in place once dropped and do high damage. Selectable Damage Types.  25 Mb/s
---
Tank Types! 
---
** Armor ** 
---
Armor Tanks use Low slots including energized membranes, steel plates, armor repairers, adaptive nano platings, and armor hardeners to provide tank that is very sturdy. Armor reps do not restore armor HP until the end of the cycle. 
---
** Shield ** 
---
Shield tanks use mid slots including Adaptive Invulnerability Fields, amplifiers, damage specific fields, Shield Boosters, Shield Boost Amplifiers and Shield Extenders. Shield passively repairs itself, but at a very slow pace. Some modules help this to go faster, but it‚Äôs a very nice type of tanking. 
---
** Hull ** 
---
Hull tank uses low slots including reinforced bulkheads and damage controls. It‚Äôs commonly referred to as manmode tanking because repairing it is rare as the modules for it are very weak. A lot of gallente race ships use this as a ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù ship of a sort that deals a lot of damage quickly in hopes that the enemy does not disengage because it thinks it‚Äôs winning since Hull is the last health bar you chew through. 
---
Damage Controls fit in the low slot, but are applicable to all 3 tank types. 
---
** Active Tanking **
---
Both armor and shield fits have active tanking, which is done through the use of Armor Repairers and Shield Repairers. These are commonly used in PvE to repair a ships HP as it takes damage. They are also used in certain PvP fits for when fighting solo or in a smaller group to keep yourself alive. They use Capacitor, and/or Nanite Repair Paste/Cap Boosters to repair HP in armor/Shield respectively. 
---
** Buffer Tanking ** 
---
Armor, Shield, and Hull tanking can also utilize buffer tanking. In most fleets, this is how you will be fit, as it gives your friendly healer (Logistics ships, or commonly, Logi) time to heal you. 
---
There is a lot more to the game than this, but this is a decent crash course to the basics. Use the ship tree to find a faction you want to fly out of the basic 4 races (Amarr, Minmatar, Gallente, Caldari) and train towards the applicable skills for that line! You can never go wrong with the basic ewar frigates and tackle frigates early on, so expect to fly them!
---
So the 1k less active players at any point in the past 2 weeks means we have more people active?
---
It's not.
---
A faucet and sink are both only relevant in terms of liquid isk.
---
When a ship blows up, no isk is taken from the game. The isk that was used for the ship is still in the sellers hand.
---
Mining is not an isk faucet. It does not generate isk. Ratting is an isk faucet. It generates isk that was not previously in the game.
---
Go read one of the dozens of in-game economics reports CCP does. It's not that hard to understand.
---
"Eve should be an absolute hellscape of terribleness" - Falcon
---
And here I was thinking it already was - oh wait that's r/Eve, I get them confused sometimes...
---
So if you do 5 things and 2 rssult in loss and 3 result in gain, wouldn't it be better to know which did what so you can not so the bad ones again?
---
I ... I want this now.
---
The DAU/MAU was in direct response to a question about the blackout. So it's not a jump to say they are implying it was about the blackout.
---
Eve is almost interesting again and I'm back for the first time in seven years to see how it goes.
---
We already passed that phase.  When CCP was developing VR games.  We are in the phase "Oh fuck, where did all the time go, time to start building a legacy."
---
Lol
---
that was fantastic!!!!
---
Characters, not players.
---
I could give a fuck about anything of this. All I give a shit about is the AT. Bring back the AT.
---
Wait so ur saying that if I can run a t1 in a cruiser or a t1 in a frigate I should urn the t1 in a frigate? Cause I'll Get paid more?
---
Which other frigs can solo t1 site (that can be flown be an alpha)
---
if by login you mean go the screen, click the claim prize, and close it without ever selecting a character and entering the game, they dont actually count as logins.
---
More awox alphas \o/
---
Nope
---
I have alerted Mister Marram about this event and we will attend in full force to claim his beer that was promised many moons ago. #never4get
---
A comms Blackout this is amazing
---
Strip out bots from the pre blackout number and you are likely to have more real players in that number
---
I'm an old player, returned with the blackout because *awesome,* but without real data to back it up our examples are just anecdotal. I know a bunch of people did come back just for the blackout. But I'm 100% sure the free SP campaign they're doing has also been responsible for many logins.
---
We got a frig hole connected to one of their pockets. For a straight 12 hours we were brawling with them in our confessor / deacon fleet. It was great. Eventually towards the end they bridged in a bigger ferox fleet but that was the most they brought. They eventually started camping our hole in battlecruisers but  it didn't stop us from jumping out and headshotting stuff before diving back into the hole they wouldn't chase us into. Best day I've had in awhile.
---
&gt;Im sure you've already read this segment posted by others above, but to support your post;  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;34:35 - CCP Falcon - the MER for July and August will look very bizarre due to the Blackout. Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data, it's incredible to see activity is still there. ISK generated from bounties is down massively, but that player activity is still there it has just shifted to other activities as players have adapted. We believe blackout has a been a massive success.
---
i think we're listening to 2 different things, they were talking about overall changes, the question got asked, but I don't think Hilmar was directly crediting only the black out and just carrying his overall thought from before the question.
---
By the sound of it, this is only experiment  #1. I look forward to many, many more.
---
Why would people who don't play the game care about a sale on MCT?
---
How many people do you know of who have quit because of drifters? Also, fuck 'em, probably.
---
My main point is that if they want to keep the game alive, it's not in CCP's interest to lie to themselves about active users. They know if these changes are working or not. Whether it persists is yet to be seen.
---
By login I meant go to the screen, click the claim prize, log in and pull up skill queue.
---
*1000 less accounts
---
activity is high only in regions like Delve, all others activity decrease hard
---
It could, you could find that a bunch of bots logged out and that a bunch of players logged in.
---
You see it as 1k less players but CCP can see it as significantly more players out in space moving about and interacting.  This is the crazy part about people like you, you quite literally can't see the data that the game company can but somehow you still end up believing you're better informed than they are.
---
Whatever we want
---
It's actually a decent way to make isk. Fly something that you can afford into a gatecamp, do your best, die horribly then convo or mail the guy asking what you did wrong. Doesn't always work but often you'll get some good advice and a big chunk of isk as a gift, just because people like to see new players taking chances.
---
They just actually just mentioned that at an hour in
---
That's what I was thinking, the fucking game has has 20% population drops over the weekend, and they are claiming more people logged in? Maybe on sigulartiy certainly not tranquility server.
---
Thats my point. The blackout allows small corporations a chance to go and take space.
---
I would like it if you could see the current status on clones and how many you could have.
---
what glue are these guys sniffing, they do an experiment then cross over it with free sp and another login campaign, talk about pushing to get the data you actually want. How many of those log ins used the down vote button before logging off. i didnt even know it existed.
---
Join one of the proper nullsec corps like Dreddit, Karma Fleet, Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, etc. There is really no reason at all to be in a rental corp.
---
    Hur Dur it's funny because bashing women boosts my fragile ego.
---
Wtf? They have every reason to lie about that. A public company has investors and investors want to see progess, not hear about unfinished decisions that make the active logins drop by as much as 20%.
---
Fairly certain it does. Considering Falcon seems to have mentioned it. Check the first post. " Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data," 
---
If people werent actually logging on that statement wouldnt make sense.
---
not necessarily, in fact we cant even tell whether the things that resultet in decreasing logins only had higher numbers in the decrease because of decreased bot activity. and thats just one example. another one would be a shifting playerbase that might be better in the long term. and these are just 2 simple factors. there are a lot more, on the playerside aswell as on the business side. The effects aren't as easy to determine as you may think. (at the current point literally impossible even)
---
Thanks to CCP, plans that I literally had just invested in game with ISK the week before the blackout have ground to a halt. I have spent a lot of my personal time planning for those and they will now not come to fruition. I deeply regret having subbed multiple accounts for months (I am trying to get them refunded).
---
Perhaps i need to find me another place to live, the reverse happend to my corp it went from 10 - 15 on comms to me and sometimes 2 other persons.
---
I really like where they're going with this. It has the potential to make Eve exciting again.
---
They still need to remove some low effort, low risk ISK printers, otherwise people just won't bother with the properly balanced risk in null. But there aren't many of those left.
---
And although I like the sound of their take on blackout, it does seem statistically questionable to look at login metrics after (i) a login event and (ii) scaring the nullbears offline in June with the drifters.
---
Why would people come back because of a sale?
---
Loving all the armchair data analysts in here trying to tell CCP that they are interpreting their ***OWN DATA*** incorrectly.
---
Pull your emotions out of your ass.
---
* Your game is changing.
---
* There isn't safety in null-sec.
---
* Say goodbye to your Farmville simulator
---
* Start selling your supers and rorqs
---
* HTFU
---
Checkmate, Krabs.
---
Hilmar's argument that high 64bit adoption rate means there are many "innovators" playing eve is laughable. More like technically illiterate people who have a blurry emotional impression that 64bit is somehow more "advanced", while it has proven that it offers no advantage such as in tidi shitfests, while using up to 2x memory.
---
His argument of active login number proving blackout is successful is either disingenuous or statistically illiterate.
---
is this a picture of game of thrones s8e3?
---
"1 bil" what?
---
It both is alot and nothing at the same time. Your eve experience is mostly dependent on income over time vs savings. Burning 400m to increase your income vs spending 400m on a shiny new hac for pewpew.
---
Ye and excav kills has nothing to do with the only counter being removed?
---
or how many of the daily logins lasted longer than 10 minutes?
---
Im not sure, it was either company value or number of accounts... I couldn't quite figure that out.
---
amarr master race
---
I believe that because they did 10 things and aren't correlating all the data the way they wanted it.
---
Here's my prediction for 2 coming changes. Changes that are badly needed.
---
1. Capital ships becoming ineffective against subcaps. Especially supercaps. Larger ships are supposed to require support to be able to kill smaller ships. The fact that it is not this way is a major balance issue that should have been addressed long ago. This will help with the super umbrella issue. Though it may not be enough by itself.
---
2. No more capital ships in anoms. They can't warp to the anomaly and can't enter it.
---
I think the point he's making is that null sec is not meant for new players and never was supposed to be.
---
True, buts it still 1k less accounts logged in, while claiming record logins.
---
Yea, now, which is the point.
---
Exactly my thoughts. Take out the SP giveaway and you will see a very different situation..
---
How long has star citizen not been out for?
---
But they are making decisions based off this incomplete data and acting as if they have the will of the players in mind.
---
As in 1000 less afk VNIs ratting during blackput and now forever.
---
Hilmar TLDRs the company's new methods/direction as \[paraphrased\] "We're making calculated experiments, and building hypotheses and actions based on the results, rather than overthinking everything, trying to reach perfection, and moving super slowly to get it all done. Perfection is the enemy of excellence."
---
This in the context of the fact that the universe needs a big shake-up.
---
Grath these are the same fucking idiots that sperg out that marauders need fixing despite never done anything in a marauder except PvE and get ganked.
---
This is crap.  Our alliance and our neighbors have changed the way we are doing things, the way we are communicating, they way we are getting fights, etc.  And we're in Legacy.
---
&gt; Eve is closing in on 1 bil players.
---
I read that as closing in on $1b in lifetime revenue.
---
why, you're a piss poor pilot anyways
---
Wow has lasted long enough and still going strong. Blizzard has earned millions times more from WoW than CCP will ever earn from EvE. And the reason is that it is only appealing to the grandmas with dead reflexes and excel fetishes.
---
they have the health of the game in mind, and the health of the game should be in out best interest. spoiler alert: stagnation is not healthy.
---
I've been properly independent for 5 years before joining goons. 90% of my playstyle is PVP, but I dont mind helping my Corp with PVE ops to strengthen our community bond. 
---
Also I love having a Jita market in Delve :P
---
This month just keeps getting better and better.
---
CCP thank you. You are restoring the virtues of EvE that I love.
---
Hard, unpredictable, challenging.
---
oh just forgot, better go through all my characters for the free sp from killing a rat...ffs 
---
and if they want chaos, give folks free sp for killing a player, more free sp in hi sec. lowest in null/wh
---
As a recruiter in our Corp, message me if you want to talk :D and that will be my old sales pitch for this post.
---
I don't get why people don't commit to fights in T1 frigates. It's not like it's something hard to replace. Even fitting one out full T2 isn't that expensive. I mined several times its worth in the past ten minutes.
---
What exactly are you pvping in? How many ships are you losing daily? 
---
Unless you are flying bling t3c's and the latest and most expensive trig shit I don't know how anyone remotely competent at isk generation would find it hard to pvp. 
---
Ass Frigs = 40mil
---
Caracals = 30mil
---
bombers =40mil
---
Sabres/ T3Ds / CDs = 100mil
---
Like every single company on the planet...
---
Maybe they don't count bots?
---
Sounds like bad statistics and too many variables introduced into a system at once though doesn't it?  Either way glad to hear blackout is in for the long haul.
---
CCP is *not* a public company, that's what I'm saying. Also, if they *were* a public company, their user statistics, and what data they base those stats on, would be public information and we wouldn't be sitting here on the internet arguing about them.
---
At my first gate camp i lost a Venture and the player gifted me 1m, which was nice.
---
However it's not so much about the isk loss, it's more about feeling so underpowered. I can't survive wormholes, can't fight in Trig invasions, can't survive other players... Right now i get to fight npc pirates and they pose no real threat. From my perspective it feels like there is nothing in between weak pirates and instant death from everything else.
---
?
---
If you as a company are introducing a new mechanic you want people to adopt, which they clearly want, but people arent really adopting it then it might be prudent to pump up the numbers. 
---
Ofc, a lot of old players returned. But I can almost promise you that for every one who returned there are five that just logged on to get the SP. That would account for the fact that the numbers dropped rather hard the first weekend and then started to go up a lot more than it actually should have considering its july, mid summer is the worst Eve time.
---
Join Signal Cartel, one of the best groups for exploring, although no PVP.
---
I will say that the Triglavian invasion in the high security areas near starting systems catch new players off guard.  Usually the high security space around starting systems is relatively safe.  Not many players will shoot your ship unless you are in or near a trade hub in high security space.  Triglavian ships, however, can easily destroy corvettes and frigates in 10 seconds in high security space.  Some missions (maybe even the tutorial, I forgot) will send you to sites where Triglavian ships are invading a system. Be careful.
---
You dont know what data they were after, you dont know what question was posed before parsing the data, what on *earth* makes you form this opinion?
---
"Were not ruining the game. We're ruining *your* game."
---
The ship description says SoE tried to make cloaking fit into the Nestor but ultimately could not, but the ship benefits from the effort regardless.
---
Likely then the ring is there as a vestige if these efforts and probably contains enough important propulsion systems that it was best to leave it with that design despite not being able to cloak
---
"The Sanctuary corporation poured uncountable resources into making the cloaking technology developed for the Stratios for the Nestor, but we're eventually forced to concede that it was impossible. The effort was not without benefit though, as party of their work focused on reducing the Nestors Mass enough that it could it way into unexplored territories that might've been hazardous to bulkier vessels. This paid off by affording the Nestor unmatched access to Wormhole space and meant that the embedded miniature rescue vehicle in the ships hull could be relegated to a decommissioned role. "
---
Btw you can see that little shuttle on the under side
---
CCP YES
---
CCPs interest. So its been a good long term thing with Rorqs? They really havent ever given a shit about what players like or dont which means that it doesnt matter what the metrics are saying, they are gonna push through.
---
Why would people who don't play the game come back because of a sale on multiple character training?
---
If they want to continue the blackout a claim their data supports it they will have data for that. Amusingly because of all the changes they made if they want to end the blackout they could also have data that supports that.
---
But higher graphics settings during tidi slugfests is still nice. Eve has become a pretty nice game visually, and being told to turn off audio and drop graphics before fleet fights was kinda discouraging imo. I‚Äôd agree with you on the rest though.
---
With unique active players dropping steadily, a death spasm for any game based on player based economy, does The Eve team have an exit strategy for the parent company that would be a new evolution and new game in IP that Eve Universe?
---
I almost went that direction with it. Probably should've.
---
"hey here's a sale on a game I liked before, I'll try it again" does that really seem like a stretch for you.
---
Yes, because some hypothesis based on anecdotal evidence about a video game is on the same level as Newton's.
---
&gt; (not including crypto which isn't trading, it's gambling, come at me bruh).
---
This is how I knew you knew your shit, well said. And as much as I don't want high-sec incomes to take a hit, I do believe your right that it's more healthy for those areas to reward the least.
---
But there are many other aspects in this game that also need a rework, so I'm not sure how soon those solutions will come to pass.
---
Imo, all these changes have only one reason behind them. And that is not the improvement of the game, but the overall revenue of the Business behind it, which is fine of course. I don't like it, but i understand it. CCP wants to cutoff the ISK supply that is ingame right now, ppl and botters that have 5 or 10 or more accts and are able to plex them with ISK by ratting/mining. Their interest is that players re-sub with real world money not ISK. But attracting new players is also important , although a new player won't spend as much as an old char buying a super with rl money.  For the pvpers in the game though , The Game did become a hell of a lot more interesting indeed. My 2 cents
---
how do you know what data they do and don't have, or what they can filter out and what they can't?
---
like why do you keep making these weird assumptions?
---
Now make the argument that brand new players SHOULD be in nullsec, and that "biggest" new player organization also means "best".
---
Go on.
---
 sudo gravity 0 -f
---
Have fun kids
---
Why do say that? Bc you can hide behind a shitty handle?
---
10 people logging in for an hour a day is more logins than 1 person logging in for 23 hours. You're doing the exact same cherrypicking you're accusing CCP of doing. Except they have data neither you nor I am privy to.
---
Iirc that is the hoarder. Very useful not to fly though. 
---
If you are looking to bring along extra cap boosters when traveling. throw a hoarder full of boosters in the sma of your cap.
---
&gt; Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data, it's incredible to see activity is still there.
---
They took that into consideration.
---
Man, that is sad. That doesn't feel like the Eve I remember -- not at all.
---
Now wormholes on the other hand... these are fun as shit.
---
So if they are talking about making eve less safe can they maybe look back at previous changes that made eve the safe space for carebears that it is now, you know nano nerf, privateer nerf, ecm nerf, can flipping etc. 
---
These classic playstyles were the most dangerous and they were taken out back and shot.
---
Actually, better advice would be: don't mine in high sec. High sec mining is boring and mostly risk free, not to mention the actual income is terrible.
---
That all changes in other space. Low sec, null sec, and wormhole mining can be very profitable and very fun. This is because there are other players that can kill you so you have to keep an eye out and occasionally run away. Also the ore you extract is worth a lot more and the NPCs that show up are more dangerous.
---
I have nearly perfect exploration skills and have done it for years, but now I barely ever bring out my Astero because null mining is more fun. I tend to do it in fleets with a mining barge but even with a venture you're looking at some good content.
---
Exploration is also good, don't get me wrong, and is a nice way to really get to see some of the different areas in Eve. It can also be very tedious and disappointing as the income stream is *very* inconsistent and you spend a lot of time just looking for a site. Wormholes are also a very good place to get completely lost and die...they're dangerous and require some extra knowledge that you don't need to warp a venture to a belt.
---
A lot of people write off mining early on, as I once did, but it's become one of my favorite parts of Eve. Just don't mine Veldspar in high sec with a venture...you'll fall asleep until CODE finds you with a thrasher =)
---
This might all be true. But it might not. The problem here is transparency, thats why you dont fk with the only number we can see, the login.
---
Or you present everything, which they havent. But right now, no one can accurately claim anything.
---
And in all honestly, Falcon is saying " We believe blackout has a been a massive success." That only makes me wonder even more.
---
Icelandic glue best glue
---
They claim if it shows the player base does not support the blackout they will revert it, and then do extra things to encourage players to play the game during the blackout. How can they make an educated decision during that as to what brought those players back.
---
who's cutting onions?
---
Weekly doses coming soon‚Ñ¢ to a forum near you!
---
Well I already have data to support it not happening based on eve offline stats and they are claiming to have data that supports their choice. So pretty easy to make both claims.
---
If they wanted to see if players supported the blackout why did they do so many extra things to encourage players to login?
---
STONKS ^
---
We don‚Äôt know **exactly** but when you have Hilmar and Falcon praising it, I think they just *might* be onto something.
---
Getting rid of 'endless minerals' and making distribution of resources uneven (and continually fluctuating) would help *somewhat*, as long as it didn't lead to 'Big Blue Donut WhateverNumberWe'reOnNow.
---
Can you go a bit deeper into why 64-bit is worse than 32-bit? For the technically illiterate among us.
---
If we had 10 people logged in for an hour for every 1 we lost 23 hours, eve offline would reflect that. It would show massive gains
---
Most of this is spot on, however I would like to point out a few things:
---
1. The delve model of economic output has been in full swing for over 2 years now. 
---
2. We just started dissuading people from exporting ore to jita (hence price hike of trit in jita). 
---
3. A bunch of goons have set up reaction farms, skill farms, PI farms, rorqual alts, fax alts, titan alts, manufacturing alts, JF alts, dread alts, HIC alts, etc, for the past 2 years (I myself went from one account to four). Hence a lot more accounts being plexed (its easier to plex accounts when you make isk off those accounts). Same is true for TEST and NCdot I believe (NCdot may not pop on the MER like goons but they do rorqual mine "because its too good not to" and likely also do reactions and some industry). 
---
4. In general the player base accumulates the means to earn enough isk to no longer pay to play the game, much faster than a real world economy. 
---
5. When you have a certain amount of accounts, you are very likely to set up another account to facilitate some existing income stream you have, and thus decide to plex this new account even if you pay with a visa for the subscription of the first few accounts. 
---
These things have to be kept in mind, while I'm sure botting did affect plex prices, plex prices will never revert to the bad old day prices because of economic behavior by players today. 
---
Also, the ones complaining about plex prices are those who do not wish to pay real money to play the game. So I have a limited sense of empathy for plex prices going up for these people. I do however think its bad that students and others with limited funds have to spend more time to plex their account. They usually rely on linear income like ratting, salvaging or mining, not non-linear income like reactions, trade and industry. Where you can put X isk into production/reaction/trade and get a percentage profit from it, then turn around and put that X+% amount into the same cycle again and again, resulting in you earning 10bn profit from basically the same effort you used to earn 1bn just a year ago.
---
Here's a thing, A bot logged in 23/7, will add more to the daily users logged in than 5 players playing 4 hours each.
---
That isnt in reference to the highest DAU and MAU, its in reference to the MER.
---
Good stuff
---
Anytime you see one of that corp in t3cs you can already debate if you want to split loot or tackle keeps it
---
So wait, you're looking at eve offline and thinking you have as much data as CCP does?
---
600 odd? I was 698
---
RIP vni
---
I thought SP farms weren‚Äôt worth it anymore?
---
It's either that or let them enjoy the fun and engaging highsec content of mission running.  People don't play eve for safety.  They play it for fun and the safe places aren't fun.
---
&gt;Shocking news, more characters log in when you give away free skill points
---
I couldnt care less if they were giving out free sp or not
---
How does players supporting 64 but have anything to do with what players want in game. I can't even begin to follow that logical conclsuion.
---
fake
---
Can I ask what you were planning on doing? I‚Äôm just curious and understand how you feel. I‚Äôve been working so hard to get all my cap and super alts ready plus faxes. I‚Äôm worried about saving up for my dream ship as it seems everyone wants to remove the reason why it would be used and make it a useless brick.
---
No idea where you are getting that from.
---
Trusting CCP is a double edged sword.
---
You have it totally backwards.  Right now a genuine newbie has to compete with the most broken economy we've had to date (competing versus massive botting armies who exploit the most lucrative content - at least before the blackout \[bless blackout\]).  A new player isn't going to engage in those activities for at least a year.  The most profit driven newbie stories are almost always driven by new players that figure out trading in Jita.  Furthermore, at this point, newbies don't have to struggle for isk - players are beyond generous in their donations.
---
If we look at our 2 month old fledgling newbie doing his lvl 3's in his little vexor or w/e with a new world economy where isk is more sparse, his buying power has actually gone up because his income hasn't/doesn't need to be affected by our argument for stomping on isk faucets.  
---
By allowing the current level of inflation to persist you've actually made newbies life worse because the opportunities they have aren't getting better.
---
Where did you get this info?
---
And they dont have any motive whatsoever? Do you also belive everything politicans say?
---
They are marked safe/unsafe on the left column. Follow over to the right to see what security space they are located in.
---
&gt; and dating someone half their age.
---
TERA?
---
Man up and start playing. It's not harder then you make it yourself.
---
Well, you're wrong.
---
Maybe spodubrain can't, but I never lost any excavators In two years.
---
:) I scooped his loot, and my two frig bros and delivered what dropped from their ships back to them, and kept the faction point/web as a trophy (and to subsidize the previous and current brawl myrms to boot!)
---
The game has been out for nearly 17 years. The game has rapidly hit a standstill thanks to many changes and some quite frankly poor game design decisions by CCP. They have to shake things up, this game has been on a rapidly increased death spiral since ~2016. This has always been a game that thrived on conflict and chaos, not empire building and stagnation.
---
This empire era of EVE has had the lowest PCU I have ever personally witnessed during my decade playing this game.
---
It's a large amount of simple things.
---
put three heavy neut on the loki, heat mwd and grappler, ram It, win.
---
too hard for ya ?
---
I bought infrastructure to develop of corner of my alliance's space that is NOT under our umbrella. This was a corp project and since the introduction of the blackout most of my industrial pilots have just not logged in. I never found eve to be especially exciting to play and played for the corp. and now this is disappearing so I might just not log in (haven't for two weeks either).
---
bring back honor tanking
---
no because its funny to rustle your jimmies, plus you lost a moracha in the dumbest way possible
---
not everything is about you people, get over yourselves.
---
He left many things out. Which is the problem. He also thinks inflation is deflation and so on.
---
Just before drifters showed up, they've given out almost double the current "event's" amount of SP.
---
A promising directional shift from the trajectory we've been on since 2016. The talk is promising, but really need to see action. Curious to see what EVE will look like Winter 2019.
---
its complex, I wound't say it's really hard.
---
Especially at the new player level, since there is way way way less to concern yourself with as a new player.
---
Just do the tutorial and career agents, see what seems nice to you and learn that.
---
Let me guess you wanted to multibox rorqs or vnis? There is still plenty of multiboxable stuff, you could train the rorqs over into dreads to run high class escalations, or use the vni accounts for abyssals (i've heard they are all the rage right now).
---
And if all else fails just extract all the sp from the accounts and you can still make a pretty penny.
---
Yup, seems people are financially retarded. And probably in other ways as well. Its becoming quite laughable actually.
---
All I know is that Blackout gave me more fun than I have had in a long time.
---
It also brought back people I know who haven‚Äôt played the game in years.
---
Times are good.
---
Aaaaaa...! You are smart! :)
---
I‚Äôd try faction warfare with maybe 1-2 buddies. You don‚Äôt have to be running the site, just have one warp in and have the other two join when you get the person tackled. I stick to novice sites so only frigates can join. I like to do this every now and then to practice and it‚Äôs a ton of fun. I take in cheap things to just have fun
---
Cant argue against that.

Holy shit this is way better than what Eve Uni has
---
Eve has actually had the highest active average users daily and monthly this month than it's had in the last 5 years.
---
Overall trend in the last 5 years, I would agree has been doing what you describe. But I recommend giving the top post on the sub right now interviewing the CEO and devs. It's an exciting time to be in the game right now.
---
Also from that interview:  
---
&gt; 44:30 - **Falcon** - We don't need an eve classic or an eve 2. We have a great game and community, we just need to make the right changes.
---
What's all this talk of a "trade" about anyway? There doesn't need to be a trade when one region in particular is the leading cause of stagnation and plummeting population numbers, and needs a shake up more than any other. This isn't primary school, not everything needs to be "fair". Sometimes in game design (particularly trying to balance the long term health of a 16y/o mmo) you need to lance tumors. You don't get rid of other, totally unbroken aspects of the game because of some "you can only bring candy if you share with the whole class" type of infantile "fairness". 
---
Most people wanting these changes don't hate null, they love it, and they want what it was to come back. So if anything it's not an attack on a region, it's an attack to a hyper specific playstyle that is negatively impacting nearly every aspect of the game in one way or another, and has only emerged when ccp made a design choice to turn null into a pve empire building game a few years ago. That turned out to be a terrible idea for the health of the overall game by basically every metric, unless you joined at that find and don't know any better. Yea, you players who joined for that don't like it, but many seasoned null pilots are very interested in getting back to business andp throwing out this risk averse megabear meta. 
---
Don't paint this as anti null, it's anti megakrab. One can only hope this is followed up by nerfs to anom spawns soon or it won't be nearly enough to kick over the sandcastles and get things moving again.
---
No I am saying you can make data say what you want when you introduce several changes at once.
---
OP overstated that alittle
---
You said new players aren't in nullsec.  That is an objectively false statement.

CCP could care less if you pay your sub with isk or real money. As long as there's plex on the market for you to buy, that means *somebody* is paying real money for your sub, even if it isn't you.
---
It applies in every meaningful way to the discussion we are having.
---
It is about *user* activity, not accounts. It is literally in the name of the statistic.
---
We have a bunch of new players we brought from our community to play eve. They have spent a few weeks in Highsec and want to join us in our WH.
---
We mostly do armor chain fleets there - whats the best thing to put them in easily where they can feel they are contributing?
---
I want to touch on two of your points:
---
&gt; CCP wants to cutoff the ISK supply that is ingame right now
---
Imo, this is great. Isk and mineral supply have been two of the primary causes of capital and super-capital proliferation. Given that the current capital/supercapital meta is extremely un-fun, restricting creation and replacement of the big toys via such market forces is good.
---
&gt; Their interest is that players re-sub with real world money not ISK.
---
Why would CCP want people to spend less money on omega accounts? The cost to plex an account in $$$ is higher than the cost to buy omega directly. If one buys the *largest* plex pack available right now, one would be buying game-time at a rate of $17.48 per month. Every single omega pack has cheaper monthly costs.
---
I really want him to just skip over mining.
---
Just ignore it entirely...
---
The game isn't supposed to solely be an empire building game, you know.
---
No, not really, you only get a slight profit with 3 farmable chars in each account.
---

With people leaving the game en mass and  unsubscribing. How will this business survive? Push more Plex sales of course.
---
so nothing?  can't rat or mine in subcaps.  is your plan just to own sov and do nothing?
---
New account that‚Äôs the only way
---
One thing I'd add that many players haven't mentioned is that most things in Eve are fairly simple...but a *lot*. In other words, very few mechanics require a deep understanding of things until you get to the very peak level, but there are a *lot* of different things to learn.
---
For example, to make a bookmark, you press Ctrl+B in space and submit to save your current location, or right click something and select "Save Location." You can now warp to that location just as you could anything else.
---
If you don't know about bookmarks, this is "complex" in the sense that you don't know about them. Once you do, however, the actual process is very easy. I use bookmarks all the time without thinking about them. So is this hard or easy? Hard, in that you have to learn about this aspect of the game, easy, in that the implementation is a couple button presses.
---
Then, like most things in Eve, there's another level...what are bookmarks for? Why are they helpful? At first, you can use them for simple things like bookmarking an asteroid you're mining so to you can warp back to where you left off after dropping off ore. You just made mining easier! Then you learn that you can drop bookmarks while in warp, and can create "safe" spaces by creating a bookmark while warping between other points. If someone wants to find you they have to scan your location, they can't warp to you otherwise.
---
Then you learn you can make "perches" near gates and other places of interest, and warp to where you can see what's on grid with that location but far enough away ships can't reach you before you can escape. Same with learning about undock bookmarks which allow you to nearly instantly warp off from a station so campers can't catch you. You also learn you can make bookmarks into an object and create "cans", or empty containers in space, which can then be used to try and decloak ships. Then, if you want to really protect an area, you drop cans at common warp-ins to give you warning that gankers are coming.
---
Is that complex? Sure, but the whole time you're still using the same two mechanics I mentioned in the beginning...bookmarking your location or bookmarking an object. You eventually add dragging a bookmark into your inventory. And once you learn it, it's learned; you don't have to think hard about it again.
---
Eve is FULL of mechanics like this. Easy to pick up and do the basics, hard to gain mastery. But only hard in time invested and interest level. Whether or not that sort of thing appeals to you is something only you can decide...personally I find it a ton of fun.
---
I have had a super, which I haven't used for three months. About the same with my Rorqual. Been mining in procurers with a porpoise when I had the time to do it. 
---
really not fun. 
---
As for the refund. I doubt my wording will help my case. But I don't think CCP deserves any cent I've paid.
---
I admire your patience. You are arguing with someone that lacks the basic reading comprehension to understand that ccp filtered the log-in event from the data.

\#CUFU - CCP you fked up
---
You are right of course. Just some newbros get stuck at mining and quit because its boring.
---
&gt;But I can almost promise you that for every one who returned there are five that just logged on to get the SP.
---
If you can name a single person who hasn't logged on in more than a year and started logging in just to claim the free skill points for a game they don't play, then logging right back out without so much as station spinning, and you can prove it, then I have 100M ISK for you.
---
You could still mine in wormholes, considering that you can lock down a system all by yourself. And it is not as outlandish a thing to do as it used to be.  
---
It is actually pretty much non-blackout nullsec as soon as you rolled everything, as you only have to check if a new sig popped up every 15-30seconds.
---
Thanks, i haven't tried faction warfare yet so will give that a shot. I'm having a great time learning the game but perhaps there is a bit of an issue where suitable combat for somebody at my level is not very apparent.
---
FC says yes, you can bring it.
---
I've done many a kind. I've also avoided ganks by having a good safe spot and if someone were to be waiting you can easily just start another abyssal site and enter before you are even targetable. Be less rude btw cause it sounds like you have done maybe 10 abyssal sites and carebeared your ass right back into dock.
---
&gt; and because they are turtled up defensivley that makes less targets for hunters.

---
Sorry, but you're catching me on the wrong side of the day. Right now, I'm burning with anger towards CCP and it's not about to go down.
---
&gt; You can take out small groups and harass the everliving shit out of someone but past that what do people expect?
---
i mean, the argument isn't really that a group of hydrabois should be able to end goons/tapi/ncpl/etc, what's being asked is exactly to be able to harass them, and that's about it.

A sale on monthly subscriptions, sure! Somebody who does play EVE maybe subscribing an *additional account* or two and raking in those sweet discounts on MCT, you bet! But somebody who doesn't play EVE would care about a sale on MCT about as much as somebody with no feet would care about a sale on shoes.
---
A lot of the activities that the blackout actually made more dangerous are also the most easily multiboxed (I.E. afk null ratting and mining). If you have 80 people with 5 miners/VNI alts each that dont log in because they can't safely run in the background, it makes the 'pilots in space' number dip by 400. 
---
CCP likely has filters in place to check for this sort of thing (it's probably even the same check that makes sure you dont have multiple alphas logged in at once) and is taking that into account while they run their data.
---
If I don't play the game what the fuck does a million SP do for me?
---
I'm not saying that *nobody* is doing that, but I am saying that if it's common enough that you can name *one* person who is, then I'll eat my words.
---
Read this part (again):
---
&gt; 34:35 - **CCP Falcon** \- the MER for July and August will look very bizarre due to the Blackout. Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data, it's incredible to see activity is still there. ISK generated from bounties is down massively, but that player activity is still there it has just shifted to other activities as players have adapted. We believe blackout has a been a enormous success.
---
Oh please, teach me more about life senpai.
---
And you are making assumptions here. Why the fuck would one region cause anything? Thats just a shitty narrative that people keep spinning. 
---
Yet again, you are presenting opinions as fact. Please, provide me some facts behind your statements. Or is this just another rant about how things arent the way you like it so youre gonna huff and puff? Cause, let me tell you, its getting very tiresome.
---
I'm not sure how excav deaths support removal of blackout? If anything it just shows its doing a good job reigning in excavators \*badly\* needed it. Or is your conclusion from these deaths that literally the entirety of PvPers has abandoned all other lifestyles to go bomber excavators? I think you should rub some more brain cells together and think harder about things. But I guess that's hard to do in between shitposting in local and getting salty about intel missing a few bombers.

I guess the question is whether the loss of people with multiple accounts is offset by any increased longevity and individual player retention.  It might actually increase cash flow if the outgoing group was primarily plexing anyway.

It is confusing at first but yeah man up and come lose some ships with us. You'll find plenty of help learning how to do things. Join Eve University and learn the basics from old pros.
---
Don't inject a bunch of skill so you can fly an expensive ship right away. You'll lose it and ragequit. Fly and lose a hundred frigates to properly begin your constant dying process.
---
Here are some of my reactions after listening to this.
---
Positive
---
* Perhaps contrary to many people I talk to, I kinda like the "talk less do more" approach. CCP has been slow to react to most problems of Eve. I can see how some of it is just due to extreme conservatism that might occur at the community, CSM, and even internally at CCP level. Even among CSM, there can be conversations that squeeze far beyond the initial purpose and merely go counterproductive places. Moreover, most of the community is at the level of understanding the effects of nullsec stagnation and safety, so people are more open to sudden big changes to their playstyle without going into the summer into rage mode.
---
* Finally CCP is at the level of getting the game's stagnation and safety problems. But the chaos era shouldn't be about chaos emerging from randomness, or it shouldn't be predictable attacks creating manhour tax. It should be about systematic, targeted chaos that encourages meaningful gameplay in the most stagnant areas of Eve. The agents of chaos shouldn't be inherently minmaxable and predictable NPCs merely creating a manhour tax (drifters vs structures), but it should be about creating inevitable player interaction points (blackout).
---
Cautious 
---
* I don't get at all what procedural regeneration means. Just sounds like a meaningless motto, or some abstract 11D chess concept I am not getting.
---
* Hilmar is rephrasing Blizzard's quote ("easy to learn , hard to master"). But I hope CCP spends equal time on both NPE and veteran gameplay, and doesn't allocate something like 95% devtime to NPE this year.
---
* Resource depletion is cycleable. Most implementations of it will just create large empires invading 3 times space than what they need and cycle. Resource specialization (regions having different resources) creates cartels. The thing the Eve ecosystem needs is 
---
merely a balanced resource distribution. Addressing infinite resources so that one can't stack 1/2 of all null population in a single region would already go a long way for fixing the system.
---
Vimoksha Chorus, a splitter group from Sansha?!
---
Wait... Wasn't Sansha Nation a kind of overmind thing? How the fuck we have a split group splitting away from it?!
---
Unique users =\= Online users. You were a CSM for fucks sake, how can you be so dense.
---
His asshole most likely
---
Lol, you are presenting a fairly hard task. Give me the name of one person you know who hasnt logged on for a year but has for this event. In a game. Like how the fuck would I even know if someone who hasnt played is logging in to get some free SP? What I stalk people?
---
Just because you arent doing something right now doesnt mean that you wont do it in the future.
---
But hey listen, belive what you want to believe. I dont need to convince you of anything.
---
They introduced these instanced sites called abyssal sites. You have 20min to clear the site before everything in it gets destroyed. The 4th and 5th their sites are the sites you'll want to hit up, and the filaments to go spawn the sites can be bought on the market from explorers. 
---
PI can yield a couple bill a month with good planets, but I don't know if there is any outside of NS/Wh. LS has incursions and decent DED sites still. The primary methods for good ISK ratting, mining, and explo still reside in NS/Wh though.
---
Oh boy you just missed a shitshow. Some old crates had a bug giving them a 100% unusual droprate
---
Unique characters =\= Online characters. Don't be dense.
---
I don't know i would think hell would have an intrinsic evil cunning. he is dumber than hell.
---
Unfortunately, myself and many people I know, we subbed many accounts, and still bought plex, I've met very few people who can actually plex. So they will be losing subs and plex buying customers. They are making up for it by changing game mechanics so you have to sub and buy plex to play the game.
---
&gt; Recruiter will receive 4x 24h accelerators when their recruit purchases PLEX.
---
Why give the recruiter the accelerators, when it's the recruit who needs it?
---
I seem to be able to mine and not lose ship after ship. Maybe just accept that in Nullsec (which Concord warns you is dangerous) you will have a little breakage. Fly what you can afford to lose.
---
If that's still unpalatable, you might want to return to empire. Null is supposed to be the deep end.
---
Bots don‚Äôt do that because it makes them easy to spot and ban.

---

---
im guessing he means people that maybe entered in did something ( like apply their free SP) then log right back out. I am sure that its counted somewhere, but  I have been told fairly bluntly that clicking the play button on launcher, then closing it isnt considered a login, or PCU count.
---
I think you are right. I'll correct that in my post.
---
well, if they go to their skill queue theyve actually logged in then, i am assuming they have filtered out people that maybe were only logged in for a minute or so in their claims, but i dont know what data they used so cant be sure. I only know that if i never pick a character, and am never "online" its not a login they are referencing.

---
I'm not sure why anyone is surprised that the krabs just stay logged off.  Blackout is like having a cloaky camper in system...every system.  In the past, if someone ratted or mined in a system with a cloaky camper they'd get ridiculed.  I'm not a botter and my login times are down 90%.  I've also removed my annual auto-resub.   When that runs out I'll be forced to take stock of the situation and maybe revert to an Alpha.  
---
In my mind, a total Blackout was about as blunt an instrument as the bans for Brisc, Pando, and Shines.  
---
Eve is Dead. Long Live Eve.
---
they really have no clue about what seriously causes conflict in this game and thats sad.
---
Agreed, wormholer btw.
---
&gt;your cap umbrella is going to crumble soon
---
:slow clap: none of what has been talked about affects that.
---
I would bet that more of those will fold into the super-empires in null instead. Having lived in null for a while myself, if they make this permanent and force me to move, I will be much more inclined to keep living in null rather than move to low/high/j-space.
---
I play mostly solo because I don't have consistent time to devote to EVE.  However, I absolutely love the Triglavian ships.  
---
Is there a viable function for these ships for solo PVE?
---
EVECOIN WHEN??
---
With the drop in MPTC it is profitable again but not by a lot.
---
riiiiight, that's why several of the biggest corps in game are the new bro corps in nullsec that will take brand new bros...
---
If capitals are ineffective against subcaps, what exactly is their purpose going to be?
---
As soon as citadels and damage cap were created, the role of having high dps ships with no tracking became pointless. The current meta is HACs, and they can kill structures easily. If you make it so caps can‚Äôt kill HACs, then you need to rework everything from structure mechanics to t1 battleships in order to make a good escalation chain exist. Otherwise it becomes HACs Online, and you‚Äôll just have HAC fleet reinforcing keepstars while getting under the guns of a cap/supercap fleet.
---
I like this.
---
Loki for basically everything. Legion is great for solo ganking. Tengu's have some niche usages such as explo and looking sexy. I don't think the Gallente have a T3
---
How does making the situation even worse helps this problem?
---
Their numbers say logins and activity is up
---
it can't apply if it is completely false, which it is.
---
care to elaborate or am i just looking at some retarded battle report tool with no context and coming to the conclusion that 87 people do indeed beat 46?
---
Excellent read. You made many good points that I agree with 100%. Let's just hope CCP does the same.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted as you're correct. Dying in an abyssal means a loss of materials, the isk is still safe in the hand of whoever sold you the ship and mods. 
---
Sure there is a slight loss because buying things anew will mean more taxed transactions (assuming you're buying at an NPC station) but that likely wont offset insurance payout.
---
Yeah it seems like, instead of 2x24h boosters, 350 Plex, and a skill extractor, we get 4x24h boosters and 15 days Omega. That's a loss in value for sure since the 15 days Omega would only be 250 Plex.
---
Nice! For the lower level gas sites (C50-70) do you think it's worth clearing out the npc frigates that spawn? Not sure what the smallest most reliable ship could be used, cruiser or larger seems overkill.
---
Salvaging and looting is already a good way to make some ISK for new players that requires very little skill investment. This idea would most likely not make it better, but instead reduce the availability of things to loot and salvage.
---
Considering that the only way to avoid having your escalation or mission sites probed down even if you dock up as soon as there are neuts in local, is to blow up all wrecks as soon as the NPC ships are destroyed.
---
You‚Äôre on the right track with Gila/Drake; those are pretty much optimal for C1/C2 sites. It sounds like you just need to shore up core skills and tweak your fittings. Check Zkill or r/fittings for some inspiration; you can go either active shield tank or passive regen on both ships. 
---
Don‚Äôt venture into battleships just yet. Firstly, you can‚Äôt fit them into C1 wormholes. More importantly; bigger does not mean better so you‚Äôd be better off focusing on cruisers first. 
---
Also check out http://anoik.is/systems for more information on the wormhole you‚Äôre in.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to mention the t3c‚Äôs / scimitars / supers on outnumbering side.
---
&gt;Is it a ship problem? Im 1day of skilling a battleship..can those enter in low lvl WH?(i say low level because im still in high sec(0.5).
---
C1 you can't bring Battleships into unless you build them inside or bring them in 1-at-a-time in a DST. Anything above that, Battleships can freely enter, but you'll want to be sure you're watching the mass of the wormhole for lower-class holes.
---
It's honestly probably not really worth it in most cases, though having the home field advantage with some specialists like a Bhaalgorn could be handy.
---
&gt;My gila almost got destroyed and my Drake tanked it a bit but was getting hammered also..
---
If you're losing Gilas in C1/C2 space to rats, you almost guaranteed have a skill or fitting problem. I've not used a Gila in quite some time, but if you post your fit, I'm sure someone can tell you if there's anything obviously wrong with it.
---
&gt; higher graphics
---
I'll let someone else confirm this. Though I'll say that, if you run multiple clients, the ballooned memory footprint becomes pretty nasty, especially if also have a bazillion tabs opened in a chromium based browser.
---
I think you are describing a positive feedback loop.  Botters drive up prices for plex so they then need more bots to pay for more expensive plex.  Rorquals are the source of the problem.  Almost every time we drop on a Rorq fleet they all have names like corpie, corpie1, corpie2, corpie3....they're all one dude.  
---
Make Rorqs more vulnerable.  
---
I pay for annual subs for my toons.  Two reasons, I want isk for space stuff not plexing a dozen characters.  I don't give a shit how much Plex costs.  I pay cash because if somebody doesn't then CCP shuts down.
---
Someone got a summary of what was said? Can't listen right now.
---
Many are waiting for their current sub to run out to see if it changes.

The only people safe during blackout are super/rorq/Titan pilots in those groups. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much backup you have waiting to jump in if you‚Äôre an alpha and can‚Äôt light a cyno, or if you‚Äôre dead before they can land
---
Yea, the 2 hels definitely didn't have anything to do with it.
---
Well they just gave us all the week of SP as redeemable items, so it doesn't like CCP cares about that at all. If so they would have made the login week require you to pick a character and just auto applied the SP to them.
---
This podcast got me more excited for the game than I've been in a while. 
---
The safe NS doughnut where I had nothing better to do than suck the chrome off spod rocks and pole dance VNI's... Hopefully they continue regular shakeups to keep the players from min-maxing things in a steady state of boredom.
---
But what makes loki and legion so good? Traits?
---
AAR from Jin'taan on the SF discord:
---
&gt; Entered Provi from Dital in a Shield Brutix doctrine, camped up in 9UY for a little bit as I tried to figure out how to make Provi fight us. A few minutes later, HTP gets in contact with me to tell me they're hunting Rorqs a few systems out, so I chill in 9UY until a tackle is confirmed. I tell the Provi FC I'll be helping HTP kill the Rorqs, as I want them to be playing on an even field. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt; We enter 49GC and burn out of bubbles to reach the Rorquals that are already in PANIC. We use our Sabres to set up a wall of drag bubbles to make sure the Provi defence fleet will land where we want them to. They end up warping in Autocannon Machs, and a few minutes later they drop FAX to support them. However, it seems the FAX bounced off and the FC didn't react to their new position, leaving the Machs with only Subcap Logi, meaning the insane DPS (600+) of the Brutiixes can get to work. We chew through Mach after Mach, our sabres doing bubble runs to keep them trapped in position, until eventually they manage to get a few stragglers off grid.
---
&gt; After that, RC and us work together to pew down the caps remaining, and we moonwalk out despite having shot all our ammo.
---
&gt;TL;DR ezfrags :pogchamp:
---
So c1 can only fit battle cruiser ( Ie Drake ) size ships. 
---
now from what i read its a skill lvl issues 
---
sleepers do omni damage so they hit hard for some lower lvl ships without a good fit 
---
also they spawn 15 minutes after you start warp to the gas site
---
(the machs probably fucked off when they saw the blob but yeah no context, nothing. just a shitty BR)
---
I personally only run 2 clients and have 32 gb of ram, so I haven‚Äôt encountered an issue with it, though it definitely could be an issue for some people.
---
--- 02:25 - Hilmar: "We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years" - (DAU/MAU = Daily/Monthly active users).
---
Lol thats a nice joke i havnt meet a single guy tht has come back for the blackout and i know alot of people that has droped the game. The reasons for some people still login its becuse they have theys suscription still runing and just loging for the skill points and hoping the game gets balanced again but if this is true well..  GL lool
---
  -----   Falcon
---
OMG whit this guy  i could say alot  of things but ugh im just gona say if this guy was working in my company, he will not pass the cleaning area relly xD
---
CCP keeps living in the past trying to renew and old game but that thing will never work, all the developers of other games know that, thats why they make ("eve 2, eve 3, eve4, etc..")
---
They misrepresented it a bit, but I had to raise an eyebrow at Hilmar saying he wasn't familiar with it :/
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
2x memory, really?
---
Cool
---
I don't get it, provi keeps committing caps when rc obviously have the supercap advantage and backup
---
I think he wants EVE to become Warhammer 40k.
---
Yes, high sec is a lot easier place to live than nullsec.. at least if they go through their plan.   
---
When I started the game, I didn't get titan in 6 months of carrier ratting in null sec after skilling myself with injectors (or how ever long it takes these days, probably less?). I spent half a month mining in highsec to get a battleship to run missions in (no PLEX, no injectors, no shortcuts). The fact that people have had it easy for years doesn't mean that it's  what the intended design of null sec was, that is being the end game, not a new player experience.
---
Because there are multiple people here saying they resubbed because of black out, but I don‚Äôt see multiple people saying they came back because of the sale
---
&gt; I don't think the Gallente have a T3
---
not anymore ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
TIL. Next time I'll be sure to include one myself.  
---
Thanks for the catch on that  :)
---
Yes, actually the whole lineup suits solo and smallgang very well, obviously the logi cruisers aren‚Äôt useful solo, and the battleships are probably too slow/expensive to field without support, but the kikimora and the t1 cruiser whose name i forgot are used all the time.
---
Faith restored. It‚Äôs been many years
---
&gt;Well considering it's 20 minutes max, what does that even mean honestly. 
---
You do understand that failing to complete the abyss - either through death or timer expiration - is **death**...right? He entered a one way door with a bad fit -- his options were:
---
1) He dies.
---
2) He manages not to die.
---
The probability of #1 is much higher due to the fitting mistake, but managed to pull it out.
---
in development since 2011, initial release planned for 2014
---
Really thats not what Goons are saying.  The big groups are the only ones that can deal with it according to them.  They even have a plan for the new bro to take all the pain out of any losses.

About cruiser skills
---
So you think i should skill for the Fits and skill up the cruiser skills? 
---
Im still very fresh man this is too much haha
---
This is my fit 
---
Yes, cynos are a bit of an issue. Dscan helps though. We use it all the time but you really can't stop logged off cloakies in whs either. 
---
The only difference is that you won't get dread bombed in whs, which means only super and carrier carebears have to deal with that problem. Not most of null.
---
Whereas a good 60% - 80% of the people I used to play with, who quit the game over the last 3 years, have resubbed specifically for this.
---
This change catered to a different playstyle than the alliance level krab I assume you play with
---
Turned out to be a pretty blobby fight on our side, but was a decent engagement. If Provi had turned on the Brutixes instead of trying to apply to Lokis with no webs, they might have won the fight after their FAXes stabilised.
---
Went out hoping to get a BC vs BC (or BC vs HAC) fight, ended up with like 20b of frags though, so not complaining.
---
The reason the Loki is the best is because when you put a faction point/webs on it you get very far tackle range. Using this range you can safely attack people and just warp out if friends start coming or if you're losing since you'll be out of their tackle range and they will be too slow to catch you.
---
You literally can't imagine a way a subscription sale might bring someone back to the game to try again?
---
You've never seen people manipikaye data to make it support their point of view?
---
You get the point though, bots who rat in 8+ hour shifts, afk multi-account VNI/rorq krabs who play for their entire evening, etc all will sit adding to the online playercount for absolutely ages.
---
Ughhhh...nooo, they are going to be changing vastly or getting rid of asset safety.  urg that really blows.
---
So less players are in nullsec and that's celebrated? And how long do they expect this to hold out?
---
I can only speak for myself, but I've been really happy with the blackout.  Lots of action in Delve
---
Can confirm. Heard about the blackout - looked back into EvE, figured I'd give it a shot again...
---
Fuck I joined a corp and subbed for a year. I THOUGHT I WAS FREE I HAVE BEEN CLEAN SINCE 2008
---
But Marauders are exactly the same as a more expensive weak dread!
---
Yeah, I never thought I'd say this but in this instance I'm actually rooting for Provi when I look at the BR
---
You have no more proof than I do, we just know the average now of characters logged on at any point has been down by 1k. Making assumptions towards the types of players is impossible.
---
CCP seems to feel differently, they wana make it worse, personally I think they have fkn lost the plot and done the one thing they shouldn't have, listened to the sperg from reddit.
---
someone said neato burrito, I'm good now ^_^
---
And numbers we can see show 1k less player characters online at any point in the last two weeks. Should we believe data we can see or what CCP says?
---

---
www.anoik.is for wormhole info
---
basically stick to C1-C3 pirate relic sites.
---
I‚Äôve been in two wormhole corps so far, and they both use HAM prophecies or vnis for newbie capable ships. Aside from that, tackle and ewar were my jam when I was new
---
That would be really, really dumb.
---
The player that has 15 alts logged in at once is 15 times more valuable to CCP than a player with one account.
---
the missiles are fine need a t2 invul and better cap skills and also a second 
---
this is my fit its t2 and 50 mn y-t something and the rigs are t2 for resists  [https://imgur.com/p1qfYkR](https://imgur.com/p1qfYkR)
---
Well, their current plan is to SRP losses of ratting myrmidons. I don‚Äôt think they have a long term plan at all right now, no point in making one when CCP is changing everything so much.
---
You miss 100% of the shots, you don't take.  
---
Also for the $$ they are getting. CCP should be able to fix the game if they just listen to players, and bring back the AT tbqh. 
---
 Actually listening to players whom are not csm memebers, but actual  players suggestions that are consistent with others. Then pool the top problems, and fix them if they don't workout. Have a patch outline ready, and implement it if needed. Doing damage control, and patching  a shitty release is a lot better than just running with it, and not doing anything about it.  
---
Breaks my heart. My first wspace gankboat was an unironic cloaky Proteus
---
&gt;Can you go a bit deeper
---
nice
---
The active playercount before was massively inflated by people rorqual mining for hours upon hours passively in the background every hour they're at their PC. Don't forget the bot accounts playing 8 hour shifts daily.
---
Blackout attracts the type of player to log in for a few hours and look for trouble, join a fleet, etc.
---
One bot account can contribute almost 10x as much to the logged in player numbers as the average dude who logs in for an hour a day over the week.
---
Industry and PvP are 2 sides of the same coin.  Some people can only see one side of that coin - be it the indy side or the PvP side.
---
My main concern:  CCP have gone down the path of not worrying so much about player numbers and are just trying to extract more out of the hooked players.  Making you hang more and more isk on the line to make decent isk serves two purposes;  keeps the whaling fleets happy and provides an incentive to buy a bunch of plex to start your rorq fleet (or whatever your money making plan was - it likely cost a lot to scale).  This forces some out, but many just start sticking more money in.
---
Inb4 someone talks about how Eve never costs them anything....  I've played for a long time and have some pretty good toons and a significant amount of isk, but even I can't buy a titan without slapping the plastic down for some Plex.  I had dreams of doing it with my rorqs and supers.....  but that is looking increasingly unlikely.  There are a lot more people out there in my situation than in the situation of being able to spend the time and energy to make that much isk, and it is just getting harder.
---
also inb4 "titans online" blah blah blah - it is how the game works nowadays, deal with it.
---
&gt;You are arguing with someone that lacks the basic reading comprehension to understand that ccp filtered the log-in event from the data.
---
Uh....they're claiming that the DAU/MAU is up inducing during the time the log-in event was going on.
---
I really want to see the SQL you think can filter on the intent of the player logging in.
---
I do agree.  It is a problem, but not the biggest one.
---
Pro local supporters would do better to point out how much more fleet vs fleet action takes place without local.  When 2 decent FCs both have perfect intel on the other fleet, you won't get too many fights unless both sides think they can win.  With imperfect intel, often one side thinks they can win when it may not be the case and content happens.
---
My first post was a bit tongue in cheek. Lokis are amazing in pretty much every aspect. They can be flown solo kitey with arty and webs, HAM brawl fit, fleet fits, ect. There's just a ton of viable fits for it. If you have to train one T3, it's the Loki without a doubt.
---
Legion is great for ganking because you get two bonused neuts that are really like 4+medium neuts. They tank like a mother fucker with dual rep. And they can shit out 800dps heated. And they get a heating bonus.
---
Ever stop to think whether the login event wasn't simply to inflate lazy login numbers but rather to see if they could tempt the `I SPENT 4 MONTHS SAVING UP FOR MY RATTING NYX AND NOW ITS USELESS` idiots to log in and give blackout a try?
---
Loki, Loki and Loki
---
Because other T3Cs have horrible speed, horrible slot layouts, no web range and horrible fitting space
---
*eye twitch*
---
&gt;I think the devs and those who implemented this had that in mind.
---
I've worked way, way too long in the software industry to have such faith.
---
i use to use it for low tier abyassals but now its just for running events don't run the mwd alot and you should stay pretty stable
---
I'm not sure I would brag about dunking a 46 man BS Fleet with 86 people and 2 supers.  But you do you
---
How so?
---
Trying not to seem like a dick if you don't know don't use a t3 move out of high sec you will be hunted by people like me. See you soon
---
Google pathfinder. Good little tool for living in a wormhole. Tracks your location/connections, lets you see the holes statics and you can put in information about that hole (who lives there, is they are hostile etc..) A gila should easily clear C1/C2, you might be in something higher.
---
But he is arguably worse for the health of the game than 7 individual, actively engaged players. Lowering the necessity and return of multi-boxing is the exact sort of thing that needs to happen if CCP want newbros to be useful in space as more than f1 monkeys.
---
I think he wants eve to be unfun and terrible for everyone except 4 people.
---
Those shields are all T2 right? I cant see in the photo. Thing is , the sleepers on gas site were really destroying me lol
---
I dont have the missile launcher T2..i have the prototype arbalest..maybe should i switch to T2?
---
Is the shields really going to make all the difference? Should i skil as high as i can on drone dmg right?
---
We have no idea how many of those were what kinds of player. All we can see for sure is that on average at any point there were 1000 less accounts logged in. Every answer given is oh but those are bots but you can't know that. In what world is 1000 less people in game a good thing. And even if they are all bots can we not assume they will just start botting in highsec where they are even safer?
---
&gt;i havnt meet a single guy tht has come back for the blackout
---
Maybe because you're in a PVE corp?
---
Now make the argument that is how the game should be.
---
&gt;But he is arguably worse for the health of the game than 7 individual, actively engaged players.
---
Depends on which part of the sandbox you want people in.
---
If your goal is "nothing but roaming cruiser gangs!!", then you probably want more real players.
---
If you want cheaper ships so that those cruiser gangs can afford to whelp constantly, you want more industrial alts.
---
I love when people actually make sense.  This is what I was saying as well.  Just because you cannot kill what ever you want, does not mean that it cannot die.
---
I'll probably unsub if they change asset safety in a  negative way
---
I'm getting sick to death of the certain players/alliances  constantly whining and getting things reversed because they are miserable sods
---
You forgot to drop the mic on they asses
---
So by your own example they might be using the login event to get more people to play during the blackout. Which they can then use to declare the blackout a success because more people played during it. Doesn't that seem like circular logic? We bribed players to play during a contentious event and they took the bribe showing our event was good?
---
There are ships that has bonuses for scanning. I personally use the Astero, it's relatively cheap, fast and gives you the opportunity to kill some smaller ships.
---
and paying at a premium over a simple subscription to boot.
---
The law isn't completely true though.
---
For example, new bros don't multibox. Anything that hurts multiboxers is going to target experiened groups more.
---
If I chose to clear the npc's I used a VNI, passive shield tanked to clear C1, C2 and C3 sites of the sleepers. It just depended on the number of sites and how much gas I huffed before the sleepers arrived. Sometimes its more fun to kill the sleepers, othertimes its more profitable to move to the next gas site. Since I was living in LowSec, it was always a pain to head back down the chain to get to the house to pick up a ratting ship to then jump back through the chain to get the last bit of gas. Usually i could scan down another site in the time it took me to do all of that noise.
---
Except, it still is a meaningful distinction.
---
Nullsec is not for newbros.
---
Changes like blackout affect nullseccers. Nullseccers are not newbros.
---
"A tutorial for new players by a new player" - oh boy, someone who has no idea how the game works teaching people how the game works, what could possibly go wrong?
---
He's definitely the special one
---
2 large shield t2 which give you more time its a passive fit so they can eat up a good chuck of your shields the missiles t1 should be fine as long as the skills are above 3 and drone dps is a huge bonus
---
Yes
---
Whelp they are, dont know when but its coming eventually, they are going to be doing 'something' to asset safety and it looks likely they will be getting rid of it from Citadels and putting it in NPC stations only.  Which imo is an awful change.  I thought asset safety was one of the best changes they ever did.  Urgggg.
---
"A tutorial for new players by a new player"
---
just a new player playing the tutorial lol
---
If I had 1000 bots logged in for 23 hours vs 10000 players logged in for one hour, I should only see a net 13k hours of play time lost. Instead I'm seeing 23k hours of play time lost. Scaling your numbers up makes them look crazy.
---
is that mostly for pvp? We want them to be able to help with sites too.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for over five years. I‚Äôm still learning new things. Still making mistakes. Still getting the shakes. Still having a blast with my fleetmates.
---
well it has been going on for more than 4 hours. you have called the doc, right?
---
Yeah, this. Not sure why anyone would downvote if they've been here longer than a month. CCP has quite a habit of saying something nice, or starting something with potential...
---
...
---
look for sites that have names like blood raider and shansha those don't have rats
---
Well I‚Äôll let you know, I am part of an umbrella and handle some of the response fleets so I have a smidge idea of the work involved. At first we were all worried about if we can undock and make money, will we be dropped on constantly?
---
After talking with everyone, we realized that yes, yes we can and we need to be confident in our home defenses. We had been defending our home for 3 years, we are practiced and know what to do. So we all mine and rat again. 
---
I would recommend getting the confidence back from your guys, you need to believe that you can make your space safe or at least safe enough to get help from the bigger part of your alliance. It may mean have bubbles and scouts, or a few caps logged in on standby next door to jump to people. You guys can do it if you work together and learn from other groups that are already established.
---
But don't forget, because people switched to 64bit client they're certainly less risk averse and will undock more!
---
Why are you such a coward lol
---
Why would a supercap umbrella even matter if capitals can't rat in anomalies? That's what doesn't make sense to me. If no one is carrier or supercarrier ratting, what is there to hunt? AFK myrmidons?  
---
If rorquals get nerfed enough that no one uses them, nullsec will just be barren aside from dominix fleet gate camps, or disposable subcap ratters.  
---
Removing the ability for ships to do pve activities is what ends up killing pvp as well, it makes no sense, there will be nothing to fight over.
---
Unfortunately every small smidgen of confidence I get back in the game and it's players get smashed. It's Pavlovian at this time.
---
elite
---
i have about 20 individual characters spread over 10 or so accounts, not every account has 3 chars because i'm a lazy fuck.
---
i can't remember the last time, before this SP give away, that i logged in every character in a single day, let alone for the last 3 or 4 consecutive days.
---
sure, i'm logging in more characters - but because i'm logging in every character to kill 1 tutorial rat each - i'm PLAYING less that i ever have. some days i struggle to find the time just to kill 1 tutorial npc on each character.
---
Privateer nerf? Please elaborate.
---
So you didnt watch it but still felt the urge to post your comment.
---
&gt;I'm having to post this a lot, you don't work there, how do you know what data they're even looking for?
---
Those of us who've spent a long time writing software that involves databases can make some pretty good guesses.
---
An incredibly complex set of queries that attempts to filter on behavior is really hard, and even harder to get right.  Especially when your data is a relatively simple SQL database like the one backing Eve.
---
Some simple COUNTs are pretty easy, and gives enough information for management to think they're informed.
---
I never said it was needed. Though these other income sources niche then your warp to a haven and krab.
---
I'm actually looking to rent some lowsec moons that you can mine spod on with instant local! hmu if interested :)
---
For the first few weeks your plan seems perfect, do the tutorial missions and hang out in rookie chat. Expect to loose a few ships, so dont get attached to them.
---
No thank you.
---
Those are actually the bot serial numbers.
---
Says the guy that only PVPs....
---
Enjoy your corp dying then.
---
Almost like we've seen how CCP treat "statistics" before and have reason for skepticism
---
There is one way in which blowing up in the abyss "removes" liquid ISK from the game: the implants lost. Implants aren't mined, implants are bought from NPC-run LP stores, making them an ISK sink (and LP sink). So any time someone purchases a new implant (and either uses it or posts a Sell Order for it), that removes ISK from the game. And the more people welp pods to the Abyss, the more implants need to be re-purchased from the LP stores to prop up the market.
---
Can we get a TL:DR for those of us who don't have the patience for 2 hours of talk?
---
&gt; [Citation Required]
---
 unless you're working for the company you quite literally have no idea how they're approaching the problem as a company and yet you are still bitching about it, because they're not doing what you want them to do.
---
A bit more clear for me now, thank you!
---
What‚Äôs nice is, in that area a t1 frigate can be really good. Just read up on the faction frigates as those are nasty. They are really strong but you can take them down with t1. Example, my friend and I took a punisher and a slicer into a novice site against a cruor, blood raider frigate. The fight was great and I got him into like 10% structure before he finally blew me up. Looking on zkill, he runs 500 mil fits and my 8 mil ship almost took him down. He was friendly too and we had fun.
---
&gt; It is over 5x higher than any time earlier this year.
---
because most people don't read forums and had no idea the change was coming. now that it has happened i am betting next month is one of the lowest for excav kills as everyone starts using augmented mining drones because fucking lol at trying to use excavators with no local.
---
Enjoy the game dying
---
Getting the "Could not save user data, which indicates storage may be corrupt. Please see launcher logs for details." error on starting the launcher today for some reason. I can still log in and play as normal though. Is there a fix for the error and what does it mean?
---
How Legacy came blue with WC and Panfam?
---
If the people logged in and decided that they didn't want to bother with blackout they'd stop playing and just claim the SP from the login screen, which isn't counted as a login.
---
Are we talking about a subscription sale or an MCT sale?
---
Monthly active users and Daily active users is the highest this month for the last 5 years as per CCP Hilmar. 
---
Doesn't matter what you look at. Blackout is good for eve.
---
Okelsdfsdfgf &lt;-one more
---
see talking in stations.
---
Time spent undocked/untethered per login would be a better metric.
---
Up to.  You don't *have* to write the software such that it takes double the memory, but that requires going through all the code and tweaking things to use smaller data types (and there's some you can't shrink anyway).
---
&gt; They want to know if they can still make people log in.
---
it's just a shame that logging in =/= playing.
---
i'm logging in more characters than ever, and playing less than ever. cycling accounts to kill 1 tutorial npc for free npc might be getting me to log in, but what i'm doing is hardly something that can be called 'playing' eve.
---
Are those Chinese characters?
---
Because some highsec pubbie can't mine anymore? The game was at it's healthiest when you were still in highsec, don't think you going back there will kill the game sorry.
---
I log my toons in first thing in the am...  they stay logged in all day.  I am not active during this time.
---
I don't think it's worse, but 64 bit has the potential to use more memory on your system, the client. Does this memory consumption help you?     
---
   
---
The problem with tidi and big fleet lag is that it is coming from the server. The server just isn't able to handle all the input an output during those battles. A 64 bit client will  not help you with that.
---
&gt; The active playercount before was massively inflated by people rorqual mining for hours upon hours passively in the background every hour they're at their PC.
---
that hasn't changed, they just use cheaper drones now.
---
&gt;while it has proven that it offers no advantage such as in tidi shitfests, while using up to 2x memory.
---
It should reduce the number of crashes, since clients won't be running out of memory.  It won't affect TiDi, since that's server-side anyway.
---
However, I don't think we've had a big enough a battle since 64-bit came out to show this.  You'd need something the scale of UALX.
---
t2 salvage drones or get fucked
---
which one. the one today? o.0
---
Does he realize people went to the 64 bit client because the 32 bit one is crap, and they got tired of disconnects, lag, all that fun and engaging gameplay ? Has nothing to do with willing to try new things in the game. We're just tired of your shitty launcher.
---
T1 Cruisers will always be cheap. Insurance and the abundance of t1 minerals literally everywhere makes sure of that. Even right now, a cruiser's hull is about a third of the total fitting cost, with the rest being dumped into faction/t2/etc. modules that are the actual limiting factor of cost. 
---
The only way for cruises to actually ever become expensive would be for CCP to make mining completely untenable as method of play, but nerfing multiboxing just keeps the guy with twelve rorqs from crushing out individual players.
---
I really am not wasting money on these guys.
---
Roll an  alpha and check it out.  The game has changed a lot in the 2-ish years I stopped playing.
---
It's an example, not a proof.
---
CCP favoring alts benefits one part of the sandbox.  CCP disfavoring alts benefits another.
---
Vedmak. The battlecruiser is a solid ship too.
---
i disagree.
---
i don't think reward should be balanced against safety, but the barrier to entry.
---
you've just made grinding anomalies harder - the only people to benefit from that are the big blocks and if you want in on that action your easiest/only way to do it is to get in to those blocks mkaing the situation worse.
---
if you want people out in space doing shit then you need worth while content to be beind as few barriers as possbile.
---
So youre some irrelevant paper pusher in a space pvp game. Got it.
---
This is why I voted for you.
---
It used to be the go-to suitcase for Incursion runners(also very good isk, bottoms out at about 80m an hour and tops at 180m/hr for experienced fleets) before they added the bowhead. Which, having everything trained for the Orca should be a fast train as well.

Now all Eve needs is a sports car
---
welcome to reddit, enjoy your stay
---
Amen brother
---
If people want to cut their mining in more than half, sure. I expect some people will.
---
Most people will probably just stay out of the belts until their wallet starts to hurt.
---
Our corporation used to very regularly try and take 10 man t1 cruiser or BC fleets through null looking for a fight. We received two actual fights from locals across something like two years. Last 6 months or so we haven‚Äôt bothered in the slightest because it‚Äôs a waste of our time looking for a fight. 80-90% of the time the locals dock up and absolutely refuse to form up and undock a fight, claiming the 15-20 whatever of them are not prepared or will only feed to our 5-10 guys in t 1 subs. The other 10-20% of the time they will chuck 5-10 supers at us. 
---
Once we were fed up with some locals that wouldn‚Äôt come out and were taunting us by sitting a Nyx on top their Rorqual, daring us to kill it in local, so we reshipped some bombers and aced their covetors and one excav with the nyx on grid. 
---
Their response was to jump 5 titans onto our wormhole entrance (C5-NS wanderer) and boson. They wouldn‚Äôt even enter the wormhole to come fight us with caps or subs, OR to roll, they just kept boson‚Äôing the door. üòÇ
---
I write all this as a simple example that there ARE in fact players out there looking for an actual fight. We despise finding VNI after VNI in null, because it‚Äôs boring an empty. It‚Äôs just the same now, boring and empty.
---
We no longer bother going to null for pvp.
---
are you excited for the Trig Marauder?
---
my spreadsheet is telling me...
---
an MCT'd character is worth 174m/month at current jita prices, and a 500 plex/month character is worth -177m per month.
---
making an account worth 172m per month at current prices. (rounded to the nearest million or so.)
---
Im more excited for the drifter battleship with a subcap DD!
---
/#TeamDrifters
---
Because a cpl things.
---
1 it is not a sale
---
2 those people dont give enough of a shit to get on reddit and spout their shit.  They barely care enough to login for the free sp.
---
This comment gave me a chubby.
---
Someone‚Äôs jealous that they can‚Äôt kill a super without someone trying to kill them back.
---
&gt;unless you're working for the company you quite literally have no idea how they're approaching the problem as a company
---
Neither do you.  That would be the point of the snarky comment.
---
&gt;and yet you are still bitching about it, because they're not doing what you want them to do.
---
I'm telling you what 20+ years of being a software developer and observing CCP for the last 14-ish years tells me about the software developers and, much more importantly, management they have.
---
They aren't the types that pick the hard way to deal with data.  If they were, there'd be a lot fewer in-game kludge mechanics like "repackaging".
---
So if you've got some evidence that they're actually doing highly-complex analysis and not doing something as simple as "count logins that last for more than 5 minutes", I'm all ears.
---
Ok thats you Dave, i can point you to 100 not you's that are logging in and actually playing.
---
If they're calling it a win on this, you have to know they can see more people logging in and moving around and less people sitting stagnantly in one spot.
---
Like i know you're a hard headed retard but the company is calling it a win.  They're pretty quick to eat a PR shit sandwich with a public statement when something fails and they're generally not known for lying about something's doing good or not good.
---
You might not be playing, and thats a shame cause its hella fun, but other people are.
---
How though?
---
the Lore people expect that if Drifterships get released for capsuleers they're gonna be more on the covops side considering what path Trigs took, so you might be getting a Blops with a DD at some point ;)
---
More expensive, weaker dread.
---
People subbing with PLEX is more lucrative for them than people subbing with $$$ because 500 PLEX costs more than a 30day sub.
---
Not sure where your got the idea that losing people who sub their accounts by buying PLEX with ISK is in any way whatsoever an increase in cash flow.
---
Paid by words per minute apparently.
---
Goons on suicide watch
---
You can do it. Just try to learn what‚Äôs new, and overcome it in time. You can always hang out with the umbrella portion of your alliance through all the changes and start up the Indy stuff when things settle down a bit
---
who?
---
Privateer used to basically have a wardec on every alliance in game simultaneously, and you could put your enemies to that list by paying them making them probably the cheapest mercs in the game. CCP changed the mechanics so that wars cost increasingly more each that you are in.
---
Their the best corps for new players to join because it gets them away from highsec missions and into actually playing the whole game with the ability to PVP at a level they would never have without the unlimited wallet that funds those groups. So yes for new bros they are the best corps.
---
the red croissant
---
It's a short-sighted example that causes harm elsewhere. It makes solo industrial play completely broken baseline (because multi-boxed afk mining causes artificial deflation of mineral prices, meaning you either dont mine at all or multibox your heart out to keep up) and doesn't actually balance out to a proper benefit for other players because the affordability of t1 hulls is already safety-netted by insurance, and the hulls it has the most drastic impact on (supercaps) should not be cheap to start with. It actively pushes smaller actors out of the activity. 
---
The same is similarly true of mutliboxing afk ratters. They cause inflation, drive up PLEX demand for no real benefit to the overall ecosystem, and funnel all their benefits into a single point for little or no effort. They arguably provide less content than afk/multiboxed miners, even. 
---
Neither of these playstyles is good for the game's health and it benefits EVE longterm to limit their effectiveness.
---
I mean.. if it's a horrible and terrible landscape.. I'm not sure how fun that is. But ok.
---
Coming to a an EvE store near you in 2020.
---
&gt; then continue to use their excavators.
---
why would they do that, when they can just carry on using augmented mining drones, not suffer painful wallets, or expensive losses?
---
Well it can fit smartbombs ...
---
 "Nullseccers are not newbros. "
---
Again this is a false statement. Thousands of new bros exist in horde, test, brave, and karma fleet. So yes nullseccers can indeed be new bros, you are trying to make an absolute statement and it is not true. You may not think that new bros should be nullseccers but that does not stop them from being one if they are willing.
---
Step one: CTRL+R Enter "%localappdata%\CCP\EVE" without the "".
---
Step two: Double Click on c_eve something with tq_tranquility to open it.
---
Step 3: Click on "setting_Default" and then hit ctrl+c.
---
Step 4: Make new folder on desktop labeled, "GodDamnItCCP!", open it and then hit CTRL+V
---
Step 5: Anytime CCP fucks up your settings, copy paste that shit back to the place you copied it from before.
---
So it‚Äôs not worth it correct

*structure alert*
---
you don't need a titan or a carrier to live in null, there are plenty of people in goons I've played with who can't do anything more than fly tackle frigs and salvaging destroyers but that didn't stop them from joining goons new bro corps, moving to null and enjoying the game.
---
no no....1 out of the 17 ihubs they reffed...they managed to get 1 thanks to Goons harpy fleet flying around killing Frat entosers.....it was a 3-1 fight only managed to get 1 and due to 5 nodes spawned on the same system...they ran when WINCO dropped Titans and supers on the gate....LEGACY ran home after claiming "victory" for 1 hub.....funny how he doesnt mention Goons lol....good spin good spins
---
Honestly everything ccp does is directly against anything we are doing.
---
if i bothered, i could probbly find even more anecdotes to refute your anecdotes.
---
&gt;If they're calling it a win on this, you have to know they can see more people logging in and moving around and less people sitting stagnantly in one spot.
---
they probably can - i spent the best part of a day moving a lot of alts out of null back to high so i can do the tutorials so i can farm daily login SP rewards easily. (fuck super old PI alts that have FUCK ALL combat skills unlike today's silver spoon pod spawns).
---
&gt;You might not be playing, and thats a shame cause its hella fun, but other people are.
---
is it? i spent the entire first day of the blackout dropping on everything that moved. it wasn't all that exciting. i was going to go out and roam but then i realised... there wasn't any reason to go and do that, so i went and did something productive with my time.
---
Don't play, like seriously, if you can't find passion for this game, don't play it then
---
People subbing with PLEX is more lucrative for CCP than people subbing with $$$ because 500 PLEX costs more than a 30day sub. PLEX has to be subsidized by someone's $$$.
---
Lmao ok have fun being wrong in the upcoming months
---
well, that would work too. but but my automation!
---
Everything sounds great, I hope it‚Äôs not just words.
---
https://br.evetools.org/br/5d3b6176db51250017a37314 here is a slightly clearer BR.
---
it's like r/eve just accumulated a bunch of shitters from  r/Robinhood or something
---
Yeah cause we can‚Äôt do what we really want to do and things have changed. We can‚Äôt use excavators so many miners are kinda getting tired of making half of what they used to. 
---
We didn‚Äôt ask for the changes but we will take advantage of what we can until ccp learns that all they ever do is make us stronger than everyone else.
---
if you're comparing july to other months you are doing it wrong.
---
As a miner I support this claim
---
&gt;because multi-boxed afk mining causes artificial deflation of mineral prices, meaning you either dont mine at all or multibox your heart out to keep up
---
Golly, it's almost like there's a reason I included CCP would need to rewrite the industrial part of the game to stop favoring alts!
---
Also, mining is really the small part of the industrial alt problem.  Limits like X manufacturing jobs per character are a much larger problem if you want to get rid of alts.
---
&gt;The same is similarly true of mutliboxing afk ratters. They cause inflation, drive up PLEX demand for no real benefit to the overall ecosystem
---
Except they also mean someone can afford to buy the output of the industrial players.
---
&gt;Neither of these playstyles is good for the game's health
---
Hunters that fail to find anything they can kill aren't good for the game's health either.  No alts, and you have very few targets in a lot of space.
---
its the exact opposite, i wonder how can you get it so wrong
---
Sounds like they want EVE to be more like itself. Count this as a blessing, EVE players-- few other developers have the balls to make games consistently more difficult.
---
no
---
it's worth 172m/month per account for pure SP farms.
---
alternatively, its worth 348m/month to syphon off the SP from your two PI/production/reaction/cyno/whatever alts that are on your accounts that you pay cash for or whatever.
---
Loss in productivity gets pretty expensive pretty quickly. Particularly when you are talking about loosing over half of your capacity. For people who aren't loosing their excavators all the time, it will make more sense to continue to use the excavators.
---
Adapt and HTFU, or quit. Literally no one cares
---
T2 MTU with salvaging!
---
It's far more complex than it looks.  Incredibly complex and not helped by the active scams by other players everywhere you turn.
---
So they'd rather them stagnate in some shit station highsec corp? That doesn't seem like great game design
---
100mn beam legion is also baller as fuck 
---
Expensive, but baller
---
No
---
yeah but if you're mining in a rorqual with excavators, you're going to lose the excavators - there's almost nothing you can do to stop that
---
the payback time is too long to justify that, hell they probably won't even be long enough to sustain it let alone justify it.
---
or alternatively you could just use augmented mining drones and not bat an eye lid if someone is bored enough to kill a 50m isk drone.
---
So it can‚Äôt plex it‚Äôs self with just sp farming
---
You never have too little of karma
---
CCP would lose revenue, so RIP
---
I'd counter with a simple point: we're at this point in eve because of CCP's unilateral decisions that the community (including the CSM) has advised AGAINST.  
---
Lets go through a list:  
---
- Jump fatigue (mixed bag)  
---
- Fozziesov  
---
- AoE doomsdays  
---
- Rorquals, excavators  
---
There was a clear majority against these changes, but CCP always pushed them through. Now we're here, and CCP blames the players for their decisions instead of owning up to them.
---
( SIGH )
---
I read it'll  end up being 6x24hour booster... if you buy anything it's 2x (reward1), and 4x more if said purchase was plex (reward 3)
---
Enjoy the 0% market :)
---
this will sometimes fuck your shit up if it's a new update and different things get removed / added / re-named
---
Just take a break, don't give your things away.
---
Remember the feeling you got as a brand new capsuleer going through the market and looking at the wide range of ships and moduals available. I do, and I remember wanting to be able to own every single one. Perhaps you just need a fresh start on a new toon. A new story for yourself in eve all together. Or maybe you just need to find a new group to join, possibly in a type of space you haven't lived out of much before. If this doesn't change your perspective it might be time for a new game. Best of luck to you man!
---
Fuck no. Why should I get a penalty for subbing more than one account. There has been some shits ideas posted, this is right up near the top.
---
I also run the home defense fleets and bait out worthless hunters on my alt while mining on my other two characters. This carebare has teeth
---
did they ever fix the fact that "docking operation already in progress" can practically give you 10s extra aggro timer if you are unlucky/spam dock? 
---
you can see it in [this video at 1:25](https://youtu.be/TiLejJF2cpI?t=81)
---
if it's not fixed, this is why you don't want to just blindly spam DOCK DOCKDOCK DOCK DOCDKCOKDCDOCKCDOKDOCKDCOKC when trying to dock while you have aggro, you may end up increasing the time you have to wait for as much as 10s
---
....
---
*looks up from sneaking trebuchet through iceland customs*
---
i was going to use this to threaten CCP into selling 3d models of ships...but i could load some of the roosterteeth guys into it as well.
---
kill 2 bugs with 1 stone.
---
id also add that they would fight internally as well as all the wartargets. fighting another corp in privateers was perfectly fine.
---
yes?
---
this is profit, not revenue.
---
&gt;makes capitals even stronger
---
Makes some of them weaker and more vulnerable. Imagine catching a titan and killing it when it has a load of slave pods in it
---
Btw if you have a Mercoxit miner going, they make almost 75 mil an hour on their own with max boosts. I use mine until all the merc is gone and then go back to the rorqual. Augmented miners do a little better than 2s so if you can get some for 50 mil a drone or less it‚Äôs worth it
---
Thanks for the informative reply without resorting to attacking me! Lol
---
With that being said, you are absolutely right. I was talking without knowing the correct mechanics it seems.
---
I agree, if someone spends the LP or isk, and then dies with that purchase, it's a sink. Technically, it's a sink regardless if whether or not they die, as the isk/LP is already removed
---
Hahaha I‚Äôm big dumb
---
**AAR**
---
We form V0lta, Snuff, Project Gungnir. and The Initiative formed collectively to fight the Serenity Coalition of Goonswarm, TAPI &amp; Phorde to defend the latest addition to the Raise the Tax Get the Axe structure farm.
---
Defenders had approximately 270 bodies in fleet while Attackers had approximately 500.
---
As the timer started, after the attackers had moved close to the structure, it was called for the coalition to stand down within 4 minutes of the defenders appearing on grid.
---
The tax will be kept at 0.0 for the time being. o7
---
Yes, skill up your ship, those ship bonuses are important. Also, try to get at least T2 mods if you are going into wh space.
---
...just don't let more than one instance of the .exe be open at once?
---
I mean I have very little chance to lose the rorqual. Someday it might die but it‚Äôs not in any more danger than it was before black out
---

We haven't slowed down a bit.

Oh, so you're saying the changes to wardecs made it more expensive to be a mercenary?
---
Two accounts was how I was able to live in wormhole space originally when I was fairly new to Eve.  My main account was my exploration toon,  and my second account flew an Orca which I kept all my stuff in.
---
Totally legit gameplay.
---
&gt;Unfortunately my current state of mind disallows me from being positive about EVE.
---
How in what way? I ain't diggin through your profile looking for the details.
---
Confusion isn't what will make it hard for new players. There are many intricate systems that make up the game, and surely you'll be attracted to one of them. Industry, trading, warfare, bounty hunting. Well get ready to train your skills because bar none, you are a guppy and everyone is better at you at everything. 
---
The skill system in EVE makes a huge grind for new players, one you can circumvent with real money but otherwise you are left to que up skills to train. After a year of non-stop training you'll go from being a guppy to a minnow in a universe full or sharks.
---
If you get in with a good group who welcomes newbies, they might be able to help you out with skill injectors and give you direction. 
---
Don't get me wrong, EVE can be very fun but the bar to entry for being a new player will put you behind players who have played for years consistently. Even if you get better, so does your competition.
---
AAR from HTP and Friends.
---
After the escalation the other day in U-H we wanted to pursue some more rorqy frags. However our intel noticed a modest spike in numbers from Provi which initially seemed like it might turn into yet another opportunity for a big rorqy fueled escalation in providence.
---
However, we realized that the provi fleet was forming for a spectre fleet battlecruiser fleet which had entered the area.  So deciding to take the opportunity to either kill the rorqies undefended we put a few t3'd
---
So plan was to just force panic with a couple nano supers and then invite the spectre fleet to come get on the killmails if they wanted them. Upon being tackled the 2 rorqys lit cyno and provi upshipped into AC armor machs to deal with the now much heavier threats and repeatedly tried to bubble the nano supers presumably either to force them off grid or start an escalation of their own.
---
Our loki fleet starts chewing into logi but doesn't make much progress but due to positioning and split dps the mach fleet is getting minced by the battlecruisers. One rorq managed to escape at a moment during a lapse in bubbles but now there are multiple fax and one final rorqy boi tackled.
---
Provi unwilling to escalate any further now that they have lost the subcap fight and with the threat of further escalation from our forces allow the caps to die uncontested.
---
Go back to HS, pleb.
---
Taking eve backwards by reintroducing risk to a game that‚Äôs founded upon that?
---
Players like you are the result of too much safety in null sec. 
---
Hello Kitty Online might be the game for you
---
Stop posting
---
Wait, Init and goons were on opposite sides? WTF?
---
   ^(.)
---
to be fair, one character can't plex itself.
---
however due to the fact that MCT's are cheap a shit (an MCT is less than 485 plex (which is the other way to train a second character)) a second character will roughly get you to break even, then the third character will be giving you profit.
---
if you can get better prices on your plex and sell your injectors for more than jita then that will increase your profit by a good chunk.
---
Ah, the nomadic life style. I'm not brave enough to even attempt it
---
Nice username!
---
Pay wasn‚Äôt an option. It was high sec so I went to the station and get in my cruiser to get even. Didn‚Äôt find him tho *sad space music*
---
Thank you ü§ó
---
You might want to read the post about tonight's talking in stations. 
---
Blackout appears to only be the begining of them shaking things up.
---
They literally said, a lot of null is way to safe and if you want to mine in total security, move to high sec.
---
It's almost like people are adults and want to have stuff in a game they worked for when real life comes around.  Who fucking knew this was a game?
---
There are few reads that make me ecstatically happy, this is one of them. :D
---
Thank you for at least not inviting me to kill myself.
---
&gt; Eve if up to me, would be a very harsh dark dystopian place where bad stuff happens, eve should be an absolute hellscape of terribleness.
---
Found the Warhammer player...
---
Thanks, I will do that when I rebuild the ship. I think really fit my ships badly, lesson learned
---
Tengu gets more DPS than the loki but loki is king for solo  purely because of the web bonus, basically gives you perfect range control so you can leave whenever you want.
---
easy, just join the bigger blocs for assured safety ))
---
You can't though that was the first week you actually have to shoot a rat now..
---
If they want to truly make the game chaotic and risky they need to remove the power of capitals and tighten the cost of the available subcaptial hulls. Players are risk-averse because they want to continue playing and having a minimal amount of assets safeguards that.
---
good, so no matter what, just go ahead and trash your head in the junk, you don't need it anyway
---
Give it time.
---
Cracks are forming!
---
Worst idea ever
---
Im in a pve corp?
---
Kill 'em!!
---
A lot of crashes in fleetfights is 32 bit client needing more memory than it can allocate for itself. That is confirmed and tested. 64 bit client makes this not an issue. It was confirmed it lowers client crashes in big fleet fights massively.
---
If you bling an astero (like 600-800m range) you could probably run C1 sleeper data/relic sites. Overall tho if you want to run these sites you want some kind of combat ship like a Vexor or Myrmidon to clear the sites in C1/2 wormholes (you'll need something more expensive like a Rattlesnake for C3 and either a fleet or caps for C4 and above.)
---
solo btw
---
The good guys win again
---
Its always been the case when people play in a social setting.
---
Bad pets being bad!
---
your stuff will have probably have been moved via asset safety, it'll be in some low sec station now.
---
fastest way to high sec is probably pod express.
---
You played eve before citadels? Lose a station and all your stuff gets left there.
---
You are telling me you won‚Äôt be able to find 30 minutes to play in a whole month to JF contract your stuff?
---
If you are so worried about it join the big groups guess when it was the last time they had to use asset safety.
---
But hey grinding a Keepstar for over a week to culminate in hours long TiDi fest with thousands of players shouldn‚Äôt include any reward because you can‚Äôt be arsed to move or liquidate your assets
---
That's something im fighting against though...it just makes things worse the more people join big blocks :(
---
Its funny to see every replay of people that its not agree with the change his answere is always "or its a krab or a bot" lool
---
I stopped playing like last year-ish. The only thing I dislike is that we don‚Äôt get to keep using our omega skills that we trained after membership burns out. Put me off the game for a little while.
---
I'm already on zoloft! What more do they want!?
---
Blackout is worse, really. People are willing to take a risk if it's something they can see (afk camper). I've killed many carriers because they started ratting with one of my alts in system because I hadn't done anything in hours.
---
With the blackout, you can't even see the threat, and that's spookier. So they just don't.
---
This is literary the problem of Capitals being able to do absolutely everything that subcaps do and better as well. It's not a problem of there not being local, wormholers have been ratting in their holes for years in these very circumstances, you didn't see them complaining. The problem is that Capital ships simply should not be able to do content designed for Subcapital ships. fighters are just too good,HAW dreads and just too good,there's no reason to use subcaps when capital can do it 50x better
---
Haven't played in a while, but as a player that bounced between wormholes and k-space, what your describing is what wormholes are like, except in wormholes you can roll your static until you find someone to fight if you want to.
---
My personal take is that this current state is probably better in the long run, it just isn't the god sent savior it was hyped up to be.
---
&gt;i don't think reward should be balanced against safety, but the barrier to entry.
---
Barrier to entry is basically no longer an issue in this case because of injectors. If something is very safe, people can do it all day, so then you have reduce the rewards.
---
&gt;you've just made grinding anomalies harder 
---
No. Thats a different thing. They would be as easy to grind, you just dont get as much because you almost never lose anything.
---
&gt;if you want people out in space doing shit then you need worth while content to be beind as few barriers as possbile.
---
They should have to fight their neighbors if they want more. The purpose of the game is not some scheme where groups decide to not fight so they can abuse the mechanics that are there to support the fighting that doesnt happen.
---
Haha I've played eve for 15 years you dumb fuck and 75% nullsec in proper pvp roaming gangs and all the fucking major wars and the rest low sec pvp and piracy. So go fuck yourself you dumb fuck.  Its people.like you that's fucked the game.
---
Do it !
---
It‚Äôs fun
---
It was amazing.  
---
I did Brave Newbies for a couple of months,  but started wandering off on my own more and more.  
---
Was experimenting with mining and discovered some really rare ice or something,  and that got me interested in exploring.  Then when I first ventured into a wormhole and popped out 40 jumps from home, I was hooked.
---
Eventually moved into a hole and set up a POS and then just got bored with the hole thing.
---
I've been winning Eve for a couple of years,  but recently came back and activated a couple of accounts with old Plex I had hanging around.  I haven't activated the Orca account yet,  but am thinking about it and just going nomad again.
---
If you have any inclination to do it,  do it now.  The fact that it scares you makes it more epic.  You'll only be a scared youngling once.
---
1.50 Zlatans? Zlatan does not approve.
---
STDs
---
Webs = damage application. Boom. Un-conundrumed. 
---
Artillery = RNG.. little to mediocre skills means when you hit, you might hurt it a little, but you're probably just gonna tickle it most likely with lots of time for local reps to fix what you broke. Higher-end skills will make them call you 'daddy' though.
---
Missiles (assuming within range) = full damage each volley minus resists, signature and velocity.
---
I did and it was AWFUL.  You should be able to live out in null sec and not have to move your shit back and forth between npc stations all the time, it would be more than just 30 mins a month ( this also specifically detriments players that dont have alot of alts or ar e new.)  I am all for adding more value to a citadel being destroyed but NOT by fucking over people who play this as a game and want to play in Null sec.  I do not think this is at all a good way of introducing more risk, I think it just destroys any semblance of stability you can actually have.  Living out of Poses was Cancer.
---
nice jebait lol
---
tell me about all the risk we had when outposts were unkillable
---
your fit won't work because you have no tank and no gank(DPS) and no sufficient shield repair to minigate the incomming damage. Sleepers are dealing omni damage, some of them neut you, point and web. Gila is famious for passive shield tanking. This one does not depend on capacitor.

this one is someway depended on cap, however it has higher overall resistance and sufficient anti-leech modification.

---
however if you don't even know how to fit you better off with T1 bc instead of gila until you get some common understanding of ingame mechanics...getting one in C1 might be an issue though...and btw C13 also known as shattered wh's are awesome for soloing with T3 destroyers if you like daytripping. Finding one takes some time but they are worth the trouble.
---
Don‚Äôt go in the oceans please that level of salt will kill pretty much anything
---
He could sure but so could you.  What's stopping you taking a recon to hunt.  That's what recons are for, scouting and initiating fights.
---
CCP  
---
Rebalance  
---
I think you need to add that word to their dictionary first...
---
This is what it's like to fly in wormholes, but with caps and cynos added in. 
---
It sounds like what is happening is that if you are flying solo your fucked, but if you can join a group that is strong enough to protect you, then you have a chance. IMO reducing botters and encouraging people to play together instead of solo is better.
---
You might need scissors to fix that now....
---
the blue baguette
---
Wont the bots just move elsewhere?
---
So I can't give ship/fitting advice cuz I'm a dirty nullbear, but to be sure about the class of the wormhole you're in, you can right-click &gt; show info of the sytem, and look at the region. If it starts with an A like A-R00001 you're in a C1. If it starts with a B it's a C2, etc...
---
Nice little trick that I learned some time ago.
---
I get your point but asset safety is too cheap now I say drop 50% of the stuff in cans and rest goes to LS
---
I think the real turn off is it comes across as a hassle. I'm living in a wormhole now and have been for a few months, having a lot of fun. Maybe when that wears off ill give the nomad life a try
---
Yeah ... no, you got it really wrong dude.that‚Äòs something no one is happy with. A war between frat and PanFam or Goons and Test isn‚Äòt that far away
---
Asset safety all the shit you care about
---
&gt;A company wouldn't present data in a favourable light, especially when offering **a month of promotions designed to boost player activity** at a time when **player activity has been measured to have decreased due to the blackout**
---
Were you born yesterday?
---
&gt;There isn't safety in null-sec.
---
Yeah, which is why you fly in 15-man Loki squads to hunt ventures, then reeee on here when you get messed up by his corpmates in carriers. Safety for me, not for thee!
---
&gt;Say goodbye to your Farmville simulator
---
What the fuck are you doing in eve if you thought it was a farmville simulator till now?
---
&gt;Start selling your supers and rorqs
---
I'll probably get a super, just to mine your salt. You're just mad that your T3C isn't the most powerful ship in the game.
---
&gt;HTFU
---
Why don't you do that instead of crying about supers and Rorqs. 
---
&gt;Checkmate, Krabs.
---
&gt;I pay for my ISK with real money, playing the game to make yours is bad.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH! I have a hundred bil of shit that can get completely fucked by the removal of asset safety, but love the idea of nuking it. Come and fucking get it, over my adrenaline coursed dead body :)
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78029792/  FUCKING WRECKED THIS NULLBEAR.
---
why do they want to reduce multiboxers?
---
Getting tiresome? I'm a bit more tired of the constant reeefest because of changes are negatively impacting your playstyle. It's ok, it's a mark of honor, finally null gets in the wrong side of if the nerf stick line everything else already has :)
---
We're not the ones huffing and puffing lately, we're getting what we want and ccp us in line with what we want going forward, so project elsewhere lmao
---
It has been many years since I‚Äôve done this, the email was indeed a follow up, if we couldn‚Äôt reach them at the current time of a direct conversation at that point we would leave an email stating we tried to make contact. But generally yes, we would make direct contact, and send a follow up email afterwards with a few helpful links and or information. It sure was an interesting job, now that I think about it, I kind of miss it.
---
Hostile roams into system and grabs a local scan and pastes it into http://eve-plh.com/#/home. He know instantly knows who baits, pvps, or is a free kill before even looking around.
---
I once dropped 3 dreads on a triple rep rorqual with a blackops gang and the rorqual out-tanked us... #IWasThere
---
And ccp got their money anyways.
---
Mega yikes
---
whoa whoa whoa meowtiger you are supposed to disagree with what we say
---
The will of the righteous wins again. Praise be
---
Delet Fax, reuse model for mobile clone bay and parking lot. A true player-operated carrier!
---
Any sale.
---
This is some AAA refined salt, thank you.
---
Do you think you are a representative example?
---
The idea that you guys are all trapped on the same server and playing against each other forever is amazing to me 
---
The marketing guys do a really good job on the trailers too lol
---
Not commenting on the ccp stuff, just on the language he used
---
I would add that most of the complaints I saw in that thread you linked were people complaining about stuff that is normal in WH.
---
What I mean by that is people fly successfully and profitably in WH, with no intel, no way of knowing if the opponent has intel, and minimal potential backup if they do.
---
My point then, is that given time the playerbase will adapt. It may not be like it was, but it won't be impossible and it is overall better for the reasons you gave and just for the sake of playing. It's easier to fly in a system where you are worried someone might see you than it is to fly in a system where you know someone is there, but not if they are afk.
---
Uhhhhhh you mean the war Legacy is already engaged in against Winter Co? With Imperium assisting Legacy, and NC/Panfam assisting Winter Co? :thonking:
---
I'd argue they're only slightly better than highsec missions, because a newbro simply CANNOT do anything in nullsec without the corporation, as opposed to places like lowsec.
---
aside from, of course, exploration.
---
Cynos are a bit of a problem they are the problem compared to your wh comparison. You dont seem to get how the current metta of hunting is going on. Power blocks are seeding entire regions with hunting campers. 
---
They then have blops groups roaming through the region hitting every non cap or cap without shield in entire regions. There is no gating to watch. 
---
Goons litterly have over 200 camping toons in the drones. One guy has over 80 camping toons in delve. I could keep listing. No gates. No brief flash of someom coming through a wormhole, no new sig popping up descan.. Just a loki, bomber,tengu decloaking next to your ship, a cyno and 30 or 40 bombers appear. 
---
There is litterally zero counter in a subcap. Only caps can survive the inital bombardment, and only ones protected by a shield can survive a attack. 
---
Listen i have three titans. 4 supers and almost 100 caps. This change doesnt effect me at all. But any new bro with less then a cap, or in a alliance thats just cutting its teeth, has been handed a eviction notice from nullsec.
---
Know what pairs best with krabs?
---
Salt.
---
Tasty tasty salt
---
Don't the Amarr already have a semi-dead emperor?
---
&gt; Again this is a false statement. 
---
No it isn't.
---
Nullsec is not, and should not, be designed to cater to new players.
---
They... aren't? What? Is your head ok?

Thanks for fleet Tau
---
Just like ~elite pvpers~ want their no effort ganks, pvers want their no effort isk - this is what happens when you throw the pendulum to one side.
---
He's not TOTALLY new, but he isn't a bittervet.
---
I think that's the right time to make such a video. He has recent knowledge of initial confusions, and has learned what the solutions are recently in a simple fashion.
---
He's crying about supers and Rorqs, how can you have missed the salt in his post, but somehow found some in mine? 
---
It's not me making all the salty "nerf caps/warp stabs/anything bigger than my favourite ship" threads. 
---
It's you.
---
If the station is still alive that you left it in, then your stuff should still be there AFAIK. Maybe just rejoin your old corp or another within Goons? Or do you intend on going elsewhere?
---
&gt; Not really true. Sentry drone carriers and supers were one of the primary ratting vehicles and esp in the deep drone regions 
---
There were a handful, as in a relatively insignificant amount, compared to subcap ratting. Today it's flipped. And the carriers back then 100% relied on intel and local to escape. Umbrellas in the modern sense (ie tanked capitals in PVP fits with logistics support on standby) weren't a thing at all until goonswarm started using mass Chimera gecko carriers in Deklein. After the capital changes and we got kicked out, it evolved rapidly into the Delve situation. And other groups started picking up the same strategy. My point stands. Back then, you'd be hard pressed to find/tackle/kill a carrier because there weren't many of them, and they ran away. Now there are targets everywhere. Whether or not you can kill them is a different question.
---
&gt; Just like winning the lottery is a *potential win* but in reality it is a waste of time and money. 
---
Why? Test shoots FRT all the time. FRT shoots TEST all the time. We shoot NC/Horde/Bot/GOTG all the time. Literally everyone shoots Delve all the time. Way more shit dies today than it did before. WAY more.
---
&gt; And maybe they would move to other areas of the game and revitalize them 
---
Why is that a good thing? Nullsec has far more potential for engaging activity than anything else. Nullsec needs to thrive. We've already seen what an unused nullsec looks like in the 2011-2013 era and it sucked.
---
It looks like they updated it. It's only 4.
---
When these changes are implemented, the rewards will stand as follows:
---
New recruits will receive 1,000,000 skill points (increased from 750,000).
---
Recruiter will receive 4x 24h accelerators when their recruit purchases PLEX.
---
Recruiter will receive 15 days of Omega time when their recruit purchases Omega time.
---
I have just started the game a few hours ago and done the tutorial, am I too low experienced to join clans or groups?
---
1. No, you don't even try
---
2. Just read questions carefully before telling people something. That's exactly why I asked a question that starts literally with 'I'm looking for in-depth analysis..", so I guess I want to know, right?
---
3. I will gladly tell you my exact location, no need to hunt me :)
---
see, thats a good kill, you liberated that ship from his miserable life belonging to that guy.
---
Definitely not the goons of years ago lmao
---
I'm not saying I am, but a lot of people do actually do exactly that.  Any means of measurement that doesn't account for apm is going to be misleading weather that is intentional or not.
---
Shame you can't refine your IQ to help you realise CCP is obviously presenting data in a favourable light.
---
You're hearing what you want to hear. Not what they're saying.
---
i disagree with you and querns mostly, but oodell isn't a dumbhead
---
I've only really applied on the promise of a good whipping
---
&gt; So if you've got some evidence that they're actually doing highly-complex analysis and not doing something as simple as "count logins that last for more than 5 minutes", I'm all ears.
---
you should waste your time and listen to the entire 2 hours, if you're not willing to, then you can't ask for evidence.
---
because they literally say thats what they're doing.
---
Thinking a bit more while reading again,
---
* Reward one will replace reward three and be doubled for the recruiter.
---
I was reading it as 1 would still exist and 3 would be 1 doubled...
---
But actually does sound more like just 2 rewards now, the Buy omega, and Buy Plex, no longer a buy anything.
---
That's an interesting idea
---
IN GAME FOOTAGE
---
A Korean girl, probably.
---
I believe the actual Chinese translation is ÊàëÁöÑÊ∞£Â¢äËàπË£ùÊªø‰∫ÜÈ∞ªÈ≠ö
---
&gt;  literally had just invested in game with ISK the week before the blackout have ground t
---
What plans have the blackout quashed? I've been doing the exact same stuff as always. All that's changed is it's not perfectly safe... and nullsec was never supposed to be, anyway.
---
Yes, please add more bot improving items.
---
You are wrong. Look at some plex selling sites.
---
So what CCP wants to do is "hey why make a new eve if we can change all what we want in here and people can suck it" 
---
Hilmar and Falcon what a par of idiots if they belive that they just can change all the game using the same player base, all the big companys knows that, one thing is change alitle the game for new people can participate with the old players, other thing is change the game you know for several years..  the only people who will stay are the one that are relly atached to the game all the other people will move on, and many alredy doing it, the discord chanels i have of eve almost 70% is playing other games now haha and i think the stupid guys of ccp not going to recover that player base now becuse alot of people now paying subscription in other games.
---
So, theyll continue turning great MMO into trash. Got it.
---
In Delve, we push all super and rorqual pilots to have at least one fax on standby whenever they're ratting/mining, preferably at least one pilot and three fax hulls (apostle, minokawa + active tanked Lif) is the home defense doctrine. Either that or you're expected to contribute a subcap tackle alt, or a titan, or some other useful dedicated thing.
---
Although that 'rule' doesn't really extend to carrier pilots because they tend to be the less rich / less versatile people.
---
Any news on why they stood down?  I don't get in game enough to know why my own side does things anymore.
---
Tangentually, has anyone reverse engineered the setting file format? I tried a bit, but my RE chops were as lacking as my PVP prowess.
---
What a cunty response (theirs, not yours)
---
sure it's a good kill - but it wasn't particularly exciting, or interesting, or meaningful. i could've killed a completely unfit corvette and had just as much fun.
---
i literally had more reason to kill that 1 poor tutorial npc this afternoon than i had to kill that leshak. since i actually had a reason to do it, that tedious repetitive mindless task was unironically more fun.
---
You're living in NULL dude NULL isn't intended for new players. Yes corps and null blocks have made this ultra safe space for newbies top join up and play in but that was never what null should have been.
---
but it also applies equally to each side of thebequation.
---
so if anything it just makes increases appear smaller on a percentage basis than otherwise
---
Because they have more sophisticated ways of analyzing the data.. People that log in solely for things like login bonuses are obvious when they see someone who logged in, redeemed their bonuses, and logged back out. That's not difficult to sift out.
---
Same with daily quests, looking at people that just complete those and log off vs. people that do them and engage in other kinds of content after. Looking at how behaviors of accounts change as a result of that too.
---
People seem to think that CCP's only available metric is concurrent users. Look at ESI and you can see all the data they aggregate. Look at the amount of information available [through this endpoint](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/#/Character/get_characters_character_id_stats). It's granular down to the level of "energy nossed", "damage done by supers", "number of dscans", "number of duels requested", "number of times PVP flag set", etc. And the information available in ESI is almost certainly only a tiny subset of the actual data they collect.
---
You completely miss what makes eve, eve. I think we currently have too many accounts and that needs dealing with. Tring to remove muti boxers though would remove a huge part of eve and something that makes eve unique.
---
It does do that
---
A sale on Rorqual skins?
---
No absolutely not.  drop nothing and just raise the cost on asset safety currently.  That increases the pain and it also serves the important in game purpose of an isk sink.  If you drop even like 5% of stuff stored in a citadel, people are not going to store shit in a citadel as the chance is too much to drop the nice shit.  they will be forced to store it in an NPC station.  whereas people tend to be way more frivalous with the isk itself.  People still move stuff to not incur the isk penalty but I argue less so than actual items.
---
Quite the opposite my dude
---
I need to see the data. Has there data been skewed with login enticements? When I fly around I see alot fewer people and the community feels weakened.
---
2 to 1 odds were clearly not good enough for em ;)
---
How is that different from before the blackout?
---
you really believe that don't you, amazing
---
Did they say alpha? It thought they were just new.
---
Provi stays docked, people are like: "WTF those carebears shouldn¬¥t own null sov"
---
Provi forms and fights, people are like: "WTF were they thinking? Why do they fight knowing the opponent has super/cap adavantage...."
---
Something needs to be done about cynos too. Both because defenders can use them with no counter to drop the umbrella, and because a tanky cloaky cyno ship can put up a cyno to drop blops with no counter.
---
I doubt they did it without the Goons blessing
---
There's got to be more to the story. You don't stand down a fleet with those odds without good reason.
---
Link some
---
I don't see why multi box would be a problem. I mean, as long as you are still managing all your accounts fair and square and not with botting, subs how many accounts you want.
---
Never used a single alt in ly life for pvp. Only krab farms.
---
Just because people drop titans doesn't mean it's a good idea. When you're doing a home defense thing, your target profile is generally going to be one of three things. 1) A black ops gang, 2) Some sort of wormhole nano fleet (example: kikimoras) or 3) Dreads.
---
Titans are pretty much worthless against bombers due to lock speed and tracking. They're somewhat useful against nano gangs for the first 60 seconds until they get out of range, at which point they're useless. They will get out of range, because once supers of any sort drop, they'll be running. And titans obviously can't tackle anything. Titans are great for killing dreads, but so are supercarriers. In the first few moments of a dreadbomb, there is a lot of uncertainty. Surprise is everything in a dreadbomb, and you are already on the back foot. Doing something rash like dumping titans on the field is stupid when you don't know what else is coming.
---
They could remove HAWs, it wouldn't make much difference in the meta. One interesting bit of potential gameplay that you'd lose out on is catching a group of titans with HAWs fit with capital-fit dreads or supers. Titans that get escalated on when they're stuck with HAW guns against capitals are going to be in a world of hurt. That's a decent compromise. 
---
Anyway, in Delve, the recommended 24/7 titan fit isn't HAWs, it's LR guns. We fit beams/rails/arty by default. You'll get a few that drop HAWs, but it's not something you see that much of.
---
&gt; but I do not believe that they would straight out force titans to leave grid if the opposing force had sufficient numbers as well 
---
At which point you'd be forming your own defensive subcap fleet to augment the supercarriers.
---
&gt; or some other ship or tool needs to be introduced to help smaller groups deal with them 
---
They could buff dreads
---
scientists are baffled.
---
Geez I wish I saw this a few hours ago, that was a 100 mil mistake lol
---
Are you 12 years old?
---
&gt;Here's the deal though, hunters don't hunt because they love killing Krabs, they hunt to try to elicit a pvp response
---
This isn't true.
---
Plenty of cloaky gangs roam around only engaging things they definitely can kill.
---
They where formed and one jump out. Last time Horde waited for more testies even when they could already have taken a fight. I tell you what there is to it: if they acutally have to fight even they might lose their face and don't fight at all because in the end they can always move gazillions of caps to show off dank skills.
---
I know it is hard to understand, but less players that are more active is much more desirable than many players that don't even interact with one another.
---
&gt; The tax will be kept at 0.0 for the time being. o7
---
Wtf you're going to raise the tax like Vily, won't you?
---
John Wick skin for capsuleers WHEN?
---
I mean you kinda got fucked by the loot fairy there, but even if you hadn't those kills are much more gratifying when you get them without using 92 bros.  
---
Then you can get a cut of the loot
---
I think you saved eve for me. Seriously.  Thank you.
---
I mean, I largely agree. The progression today is VNI &gt; Whatever &gt; Carrier &gt; Supercarrier, or Barge &gt; Rorqual.
---
Instead there should be outlets for both. Somethings things you use a VNI for, some things you use a supercarrier for. Sometimes a barge is better than a rorqual, sometimes the inverse.
---
It's a good thing to not only have a lot of targets in space, but a variety of targets in space.
---
You don't even know who reinforced you lol.  Sounds like you deserved to be evicted for your complete stupidity.
---
Someone has to pay for it at some point, but its a protest against the raise of Vily, so it won't go higher.. and test is paying for all this anyway atm.
---
I was more refering to the fact that they won't be getting any tax money.. and No, I have no intention of raising the taxes on my Axe structures :)
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
They talk for two fucking hours about the state of the game and not a damn word about skill injectors? What?
---
The game is not really "hard" to learn, but it is definitely big - take your time learning various aspects of the game and don't expect to know everything in just few weeks/months of playing. Avoid making early assumptions and don't expect to succeed in whatever path you choose early on, you will make mistakes, you will lose ships and you will receive multiple harsh lessons while learning, this is to be expected so don't get discouraged if your ship suddenly gets blown up.
---
Tutorial (basic tutorial and career agents) are there to show you basic game mechanics only, everything else is something you'll need to learn yourself, and the game lacks in helping you go through it - to circumvent that, you might want to join player corp (especially any new player friendly one) to learn the game from other, more experienced players. Even without that, with enough patience and open mind you'll be able to learn the game eventually, there is multitude of good source materials about virtually every game mechanic and metagame element there is. Try everything that seems interesting, but afterwards focus on 1-2 specializations/niches at a time, it'll make learning process more smooth.
---
Docking request accep-crash.
---
Biggest problem is the gas site that's a oof.
---
Can't remember how long ago they implement this, but some omega skills hang around even if alphas can't train them.
---
Its not which is the problem. The blackout favors two things heavily the covops cloak and the aggressive party. Delayed local switches it to just favoring the roaming party.
---
In an ideal world we would keep the blackout and just address the problems we currently have, Covops cloaks/bombers. Im sure others will crop up as well, rather then another massive shift in basic game mechanics.
---
Sure, but then for every kill like that, there are a dozen roams without any worth while kills or kills at all.
---
Literally not bothering to roam and just afking a vni in a hub offers more reward than pvping. Which means there's more reason to do it.
---
My main criticism of this so called PvP game is the absolutely resounding lack of incentive to PvP unless you've been playing for like 15 years, like you have, and have a hate boner as old a your character for some subset of players.
---
I'd PvP way more if it was worth my time... But it honestly isn't.
---
Nah 150km with a covert ops cloak waiting for you to reach that explo can
---
Did you spend that whole time camping one system in Querious, periodic feeding Lokis, or just this year and last?
---
It was never no-risk/high-reward.
---
It was moderate-risk/mediocre-reward. No local makes it high-risk/mediocre-reward.
---
So people will just stop.
---
I'm not kicking and screaming about it. I already have my own personal titan fleet. I haven't ratted in years. Good luck to anyone else though.
---
why force yourself to do something you  dislike just  because of internet points ?
---
BBTB makes one good post out of every ten. That one is magical and cures the cancer the other nine give you.
---
I don't dislike it.
---
I'm just pointing out that just because more people are logging in, doesn't mean more people are playing. 
---
This is literally what rise found when he did his 10k sp for 1 npc kill shit a few years ago. It flopped, so they pulled it. No idea why they think it would be any different this time.
---
Your items will probably still be there if they were in one of the main citadels. You will probably have been removed for inactivity so you'll be neutral to the locals which means you're a target if you undock.
---
Being kicked for inactivty is no big deal. You could reapply to your old corp or if you were wanting to try something new, just throw your stuff into asset safety and set your death clone to your "school" station so you can pod back to hisec right away.
---
That doesn't apply here.
---
I'm highlighting the fact that a company running an event that has mixed reception at the same time as an event designed to boost player activity is a flawed design. They've also not given any hard figures, just said it's the "most active July" or some nonsense.
---
You're choosing to trust abstract statements that aren't backed up by any of the publicly available metrics (concurrent players, logins etc), because it's what you want to hear. As if CCP "statistics" have always been accurate.
---
It is really simple. Dude jumps 10 gates, plays for an hour and gets a kill. Probably an active dude doing pvp.  
---
Dude logs in claims sp and logs directly back out, probably a guy who wants the sp.  
---
It is hardly rocket science, and ever since the introduction of the activity tracker it is fairly certain that ccp has way more than that.  
---
And no they stated that despite blackout the activity level of users stayed the same. Log-ins are up due to the log-in event, but they adjusted the data for that.  
---
Thus the statement that blackout has a net negative on user count/activity is false.
---
the tapi spin will be great on this one. i cant wait for it
---
Odd. I‚Äôll have to double check and make sure I wasn‚Äôt just being stupid. Thanks! I‚Äôll give it another go after I mess around a little more with OSRS
---
LOL, the guy above knows fuck-all about WH exploration:
---
1. Blood raider relics are definetely not worthless, sure most are worthless, but some of them can give big payouts. I dont know the exact numbers, but as a matter of experience its definitely worth doing, especially if you've probed down the signature anyway.
---
2. Sleeper sites are actually NOT worth that much. My corp does C3 combat sites all the time and we also clear the sleeper data/relic sites, but even after that, the sleeper sites are barely worth the effort of reshipping into a scanning boat. Ninja-ing them in a stratios or whatever is not worth.
---
Unrelated tip; **If you're not in a corp yet, get in one ASAP**. Literally nothing will help you skyrocket the learning curve, as well as have more fun than being in a corp. I would suggest looking for a WH corp, especially if you're into exploration. When you're probing down the chain, everyone will be thankfull (and I geuss you're not a drone to the corp as you are in null, although to be entirely honest I cant really comment on that, never been in a null corp).
---
...he literally says the same things we do
---
i would be slightly weary of retention numbers through this event. i like it and ive been saying for years we need adversity ( think natural disasters) in the sand box. problem is there is a handfull of folks with multiple accounts that indicate they dont intend on resubbing. most of these folks had long term subs. i do mot believe this to be a total edge case.
---
You are literally fucking retarded. Biomass, unsub, delete your Reddit account, and never return.
---
shut up retard
---
Sounds like you need a break. 
---
No one here is going to be able to light that fire for you with words. Nothing we say is going to change the direction of the game. 
---
Nothing wrong with taking a break, especially if you've already determined that you can't be positive about EVE.
---
Huh, I wouldn't have expected this.
---
Doesn't he normally go for single player strategy type games? Civ, X, Paradox games, etc?
---
15 individuals would be your goal. 15 alts isn't great for the game, there's no diversity in what they do and don't help player retention, and potentially spend less than 15 individuals who might buy PLEX, Skins, etc. In addition to their sub.
---
All we heard was that they wouldn't engage because INIT. refused to shoot snuff or something.
---
I feel like every negative Nancy crying post on this thread is from people with a particular flair

What are you looking for?

EvE is very hard for new players, that's why there is nobody playing EvE. It is just that hard.

Make an enemy! Rob somebody maybe. Awox somebody. That's what EVE is all about. Be the chaos you want to see in the universe.
---
Yeah the name sounded vaguely familiar then realized he plays/streams EUIV.
---
Just some help in making some decent ISK, buying decent ships and getting some good parts for it.
---
Dont really want to buy game time with PLEX yet until I get into the game.
---
I haven't got the ship or the parts to do much
---
Seeing as INIT. and snuff would have been on the same side that doesn't make very much sense.
---
Why? I do a lot market pvping, that's still playing the game right?
---
There you go then - steal what you need.
---
literally every single change has people saying it will ruin nullsec
---
I'm sure you know far better than people who work on the game every single day for years, bud.
---
thing is, falcon is just edgy with the whole "hurr durr NS needs to be tougher". They will overdo it and make it obnoxious.
---
What about increasing scarcity, forcing people to move to new space or lose everything? Then they would have to chose between fighting or losing by default.
---
Sweetonia I haven't played since 2015... how optimistic are you with these hypothetical changes, and what era of eve would you like them to try and recapture?
---
"02:25 - **Hilmar**: "We're actually experiencing right now in the month of July, MAU and DAU the highest it's ever been in the last five years" - (DAU/MAU = Daily/Monthly active users)."  
---
Are you SURE that doesn't have anything to do with the copious amounts of free SP giveaways immediately after the blackout to artificially increase player logins? How many of those players actually stay and play, if you look at the number in the launcher you can see clearly there are nearly 2/3rds of the usual numbers at any given time from what I have seen. Essentially this may have actually reinforced monopoly of nullsec to the big powerblocks who can actually afford to protect themselves from the blackout and many smaller empires have ran back to low sec or logged out. Without a proper counter like some sort of chat network module to give local in nullsec it may continue to get worst, or the demands of nullsec will become such that only big powerblocks can hold it and smaller groups may only visit to pvp.
---
Pretty much.
---
Steal? Where? Who?
---
I was talking about the guy you replied to. You are as safe as you can be and the blackout doesn't change it as you said. But it appears that the guy you replied to is so risk averse that even the concept that he might possibly be in more danger is too much.
---
Pls dont out my alts
---
It's easily disprovable.  [This is the player count](https://i.imgur.com/5nGNqXd.png) for all of 2019, [this is the graph](https://i.imgur.com/9jBW3qo.png) for the past 90 days, [here is a graph that includes last summer up to the present](https://i.imgur.com/KSIKGJ6.png), and this is the [5 year graph](https://i.imgur.com/X7ZMB54.png).  You can see that the 2019 numbers hardly equal the averages of the 2014-2015 numbers; the July numbers aren't as strong as last year; and Eve hasn't set a record for simultaneous players since 2013.  
---
This series of events hasn't been a magical bullet for the number of accounts.  I'm honestly not sure where they're getting their numbers from.
---
(all from eve-offline.net)
---
I supposed actions per minute would be the most relevant then.

While running your Market .01 ISK bot the other 22.5 hours, don't forget.

&gt;My main criticism of this so called PvP game is the absolutely resounding lack of incentive to PvP unless you've been playing for like 15 years, like you have, and have a hate boner as old a your character for some subset of players.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/116777001/
---
You are doing it wrong.  Small gang, look at the ship list, all small shit that gen).  All the ships on that list are relatively short order trains for newer players and we're fielding them in numbers that a smaller corp should easily see.  You'll also notice that a lot of times if you check the related kills you'll see a rorq or carrier that got away and the actual fight was with the response fleets.  
---
Those are actually awesome.
---
You're just not going about optimizing your fun Dave.
---
That is a near constant stream of activity in case you're missing it.
---
Hi Recruit director :D
---
At no point in your rambling, incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
Can't help if some of us have memories longer than a gnat's vOv
---
Four empires in highsec, four empires in nullsec. We all become NPCs in the end.
---
Goons wanted us to assist them and panfam against volta.     
---
But we agreed previously to work with Snuff (and volta). 
---
It's still a mystery to me why that would stop the whole attack, though.
---
That's all i know.
---
That's a terrible analogy, both in its quality and in its spirit. Not conversing with you further.
---
Not for nothing, but I love this format of propaganda - with the "historical" feel of the old newspaper headlines/articles. I've seen it so rarely in EvE
---
Take a look at this -&gt; [https://www.thealphasguide.com/reference/wormholes/](https://www.thealphasguide.com/reference/wormholes/)
---
(the rest of the guide is pretty good as well).
---
First, grind 10-20 million isk. Run a few missions, or even do some mining in a venture and you'll get that amount of isk in a few hours. Now you have enough isk to buy and fit a dozen of exploration frigates. Don't spend it all though, just buy and fit 3-4 of them so you don't have to go looking for replacements if you need them. This way you have just enough ships to keep you out in the field, while also not completely draining your wallet in case you need to buy something else (eg, you might want to skill into a cruiser or something). Honestly, if you've already been exploring for 5 days, you should already be at or beyond this point.
---
So now you start wormhole diving (also known as day-tripping, as opposed to living in a WH all the time). You can easily make 100-200 million isk in a few days with very very casual play (a couple of hours at a time) and if you die, you lose 1-2 million per ship plus fit. Once you reach your first few hundred million isk, things become much easier because the game tends to scale at that point. From that point on, you can either keep at it if you like it and maybe upgrade your business a bit.
---
In more detail, with the current blackout in nullsec, local chat in null is now similar to the one in wormholes. That is, you only appear in the channel's list of players only if you actually type a message there. If you remain silent, they won't instantly know you're there the moment you jump in the system. They will have to see you, spend some time to scan you down with the directional scanner and probes, or do some guesswork on their part (eg, core probe scanning the sites, bookmarking them and waiting for an explorer to warp in to they can kill you).
---
This means you can now apply the survival skills you learned exploring in wormhole to nullsec exploration. And the good thing is that nullsec spawns only pirate faction sites (the ones that don't have hostile NPCs guarding them), while in wormholes you might not get a single one of these sites (they have a mix of unguarded pirate sites and other sites that have wormhole NPCs in them, which can be quite challenging for an exploration frigate to survive). In other words, you get more of the sites you can easily run, which means more loot. Learn to use the ingame map or dotlan maps  ([http://evemaps.dotlan.net/](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/)) to judge the amount of activity across different systems. Then, find a quiet pocket of nullsec in a region with NPC stations, find a quiet, out of the way entrance, go there and keep running sites.
---
Another option is to branch out into other stuff to keep things varied and interesting.
---
For example, you could buy pirate or faction cruisers that will easily run some combat anomalies, scannable combat sites and escalations for the possibility of faction module loot, or even start doing abyssal sites (just make sure you read up on them first, they can be quite unforgiving in the beginning). Or you may decide to read up a bit on trading and invest 100 million in the market to see where it gets you, and so on.
---
Exploration may be a bit random and inconsistent in its payouts, but the risk vs reward ratio is very good for new players (if you die, you lose a 1 mil ship, if you don't, you come back with loot easily 5 or 10 times the value of your ship per run). Maybe you won't keep doing it 24/7 for the rest of your eve life, but it certainly is a very good way to kickstart things by getting over the initial isk hurdles in the game. I came back to eve after 12 years, rolled an alpha alt to try it out and by playing in such a manner, i had a gila, an astero and a stratios in a few months, plus 2 billion in the wallet, without even going omega.
---
Have fun.

i'm happy to be flying with my buddies in centi again (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)

Can you get "Docking request accep.....capsule ejected.
---
Well, this is the first I'm hearing about 64-bit programs magically taking double the memory. I've heard of a small additional overhead, 10-20%. But double? That goes against everything I've ever read and observed.
---
It's a good thing they are probably looking at more metrics than the "dave-stark character activity" metric I'm sure they pore over daily.
---
Honestly it's more like children throwing a tantrum because you got told no more ice cream. The games gonna get a little harder; you'll be okay I promise.
---
You got me bro.
---
Woohoo, make it so blue donuts become the only viable way to have industry...... Brilliant.
---
There are a mixture of things.
---
There are things that both CSM and empire builders have been traditionally wrong.
---
- To this day CSM doesn't think cynoes are a problem. They never brought it up. Farming safety is the deepest problem in Eve. Cynoes are the biggest provider of that safety. 
---
- Local. Looks like we're actually better off. Anyone, including me, would have warned against a complete removal.
---
- Capitals. There are small warnings by CSM here and there. But the consensus is just shaping on this year that capitals are broken. A couple of years ago, you folks went to a mini summer of rage over a mere fighter nerf. CCP has been extra conservative about nerfing capitals because of that.
---
- Asset safety. CSM typically sided with the "linemember who goes afk and comes back to find all his assets gone". In fact, there were workarounds without hurting this guy. Like at least giving the existing 15% tax to the attacker.
---
- Infinite anoms. Didn't see anyone criticizing it severely. The role falls on to me now.
---
And then there were things CCP did despite the community
---
- Citadels too advantageous for the defender.
---
- Rorquals. But Rorquals are really a complicated thing as they also provide content. What should have been done here was nerfing the umbrella. And nerfing multiboxability by making excav mining a bit more click intensive.
---
- Ansiblex and cyno beacons. These are things CCP introduced brokenly good for the owners, DESPITE being severely warned.
---
I think issues in which CSM and community was complicit are stronger. That's not to say they didn't do occasionally do bad stuff without asking people.
---
I guess with that kind of a reaction it's safe to say the whole tax war thing is annoying a few folks higher up the chain. Still, that's quite a doughnut, crazy to think people want to play like that.
---
&gt;Just a loki, bomber,tengu decloaking next to your ship, a cyno and 30 or 40 bombers appear. 
---
Yeah we did that but we gated our hunter through. Was fun! Lol
---
&gt;There is litterally zero counter in a subcap
---
Are you sure there isn't a subcap counter to stealth bombers? Jackdaws come to mind, but the last time we dropped bombers on jackdaws, the null fleet actually ran away from bombers hahaha
---
I guess they too thought there's no counter to blopsing stealth bombers. :P
---
Okay, a simple "wrong" would've done just fine.
---
well you are so...
---
Lawl didnt even knew that.
---
look up or google eve incursions there are open fleets from highsec that you should be able to skill for that will give you nice isk.
---
I wouldnt go near nullsec at the moment.
---
Define "active users".
---
check razor propaganda, you will love them.
---
capitals to perimeter!!!
---
Great to hear! I assume many of your allies are, too, but the ones who don't like it are the most upset and the most vocal.
---
Nice newspaper graphics
---
The most daily active users?   
---
That is complete bullshit. CCP broadcasts the number of people logged in. There haven't been more. There has been less.
---
\&gt; **IF CCP SCALE THE INCOMES AVAILABLE AT EACH SECURITY SPACE SUCH THAT EQUITIES (NULL) IS THE HIGHEST REWARD PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE RISK AND WE WE GET EMERGENT GAMEPLAY.** 
---
This has never ever happened. If it worked like this, CCP's stuffing of low sec with rewards over the last 12 years (starting with lvl 5 missions, which are still gold mines for the people who farm them right) would have resulted in a population explosion.
---
It didn't. EVE proves that players will accept lower rewards in safety OR if there is a low cost to harvest (ie losing VNIs didn't hurt because they paid for themselves easily). Wormholes and low sec have wealth making opportunities that make null and high sec look like kindergarten, and yet wormhole space and low lag behind high and null for population.
---
To see this idea in practice, one only needs to look at the past:  [https://www.eveonline.com/article/those-anomaly-changes-in-full](https://www.eveonline.com/article/those-anomaly-changes-in-full) 
---
From that dev blog: 
---
" 
---
Expected consequences
---
* Some alliances will immediately start wanting to look for better space
---
* In the longer run, there'll be more conflicts going on, with more localized goals
---
* Newer alliances will have an easier time getting a foothold in nullsec
---
* Coalitions will be marginally less stable
---
* Alliances will have to choose more carefully what space they develop, where their staging systems are, and so on (low truesec systems generally tend to be in strategically inconvenient places)"
---
None of that happened.
---
TL;DR, the simplistic idea that risk reward balance makes people do things is wrong. You could rebuild EVE's risk reward scheme from scratch and you'd still see most player cling to lower rewards in safety while a few player would come together to harvest the higher reward/higher risk stuff and gain economic advantage over everyone else.
---
Can't fight human nature
---
I came back with my PVP main a bit before Triglavian invasions after year and half brake and resubbed my scout alt just for the blackout.
---
Having fun in null roaming for next few weeks untill job calls back
---
no i have only played the game pretty much daily since beta, longer then most of the devs working on the game currently.
---
But yeah your right what do i know. fuck off
---
Are you drunk?
---
The night is yet young :P
---
Adapt or Quit.
---
As though anyone cares what carebears think.
---
Init are the good guys
---
Or, y'know, just delete Asset Safety..?
---
Yes you did, but thats not how the big blocks are starting to form. 
---
Would you like me to walk you through the survivability matrix of a sub cap ratter or sub cap miner to last long enough for a response fleet or even a handful of jackdaws to come to there rescue. 
---
The last drop i did was on a very well tanked ratting domi. Two shots. That was all he lasted against a cyno drop of 25 bombers. 
---
I swear. Its like i am talking about apples and your best attempt to defend the current metric is to yell... i know a guy who has a potato
---
Aremchair analysts on reddit know CCPs data about stuff better than CCP.

That's about all you need to know.

---
I don't think anyone ever said the drek was shit. Sure, it is outperformed in large fleet engagements but in small-med gang it is truly a beast.
---
Grab a probe or any t1 exploration ship and go loot wrecks from players in faction warfare. Just keep an eye on d-scan and warp off if you get spotted.
---
yea I've never heard of this dude either. He does have ~500k subscribers though so he has a larger following than any eve only content maker.
---
No point arguing with this guy. Its a fresh alt that is only used to spew pro krab anti-change opinions.
---
we warcraft now bois....FOR NAZJATAR!....
---
Mmm. Salt.
---
Cool. Bye, Felicia.
---
Since this sounds very much like blue doughnut reinforcement (as it just makes mega alliances have an easier time getting around) the new gates should obviously be shaped like frosted doughnuts.
---
Get a fuckin' life, dude, holy shit.
---
Somehow, I still don't follow.
---
Anytime man. Don't pay attention to the low life's on here.
---
Some hunters are very often much more risk averse than krabs they are hunting for. They value their killboard too much to take any risk. They I were in a gang that cornered and camped around 15 players in something that looked like a decent comp. We had around 22 in random shit. They choose to log off instead of taking a fight.
---
I wish people weren't that much risk averse. But be aware that ships and ISK aren't the only thing people are anxious about loosing.
---
Until those new players try to catch up to the vets and realize there's a giant wall preventing them from multiboxing making it impossible to bridge the gap.
---
I don't think EVE is harder than any other mmo really. What seems to deter many new players early on is 1. you can get player killed anywhere in space any time and 2. when you do get blown up your ship is gone forever. If you can accept those two things and make decisions accordingly it should be fine though.
---
Why encourage people to recruit?
---
You're completely ignorant if you think the active player dropping is only bots.
---
Is this a thinly veiled "Stop losing my login/character/window/chat/whatever settings" thread?
---
The education system has failed you, and I am sorry for that.
---
They're getting them directly from their servers, which you have no access to. You're literally putting 1 metric out there and refuting all of the data CCP has based on it. 
---
CCP has infinitely more access to player and server data than you ever will. They can see patterns and trends and account for things like logins for an actual person vs somebody logging in 30 alts. I'll believe that over your one little number any day.
---
I mean, we're getting pretty far back into the scroll back.  Train probably left the station.  I'll clarify at the next stop.
---
In eve you need your own direction. 
---
You did the tutorial and the career agent missions, yes? Then you should have an idea what interests you. Pursue that.
---
&gt; CCP Falcon - the MER for July and August will look very bizarre due to the Blackout. Even when you filter out the login campaign from the data, it's incredible to see activity is still there. ISK generated from bounties is down massively, but that player activity is still there it has just shifted to other activities as players have adapted. We believe blackout has a been a enormous success.
---
  Further down tho
---
This, but unironically. How many meetings have you had talking about gameplay design with full knowledge of every mechanic and the numbers on how players interact with them, bud?
---
+1

Because Dave is a fucking moron. Have you not seen his post history?

---
I for one welcome our new Chaos overlords. Blood for the blood god.
---
Well, armor tanking is generally cheaper than shield tanking, but your ships tend to be slower. On the flip side, shield tanks can be fast because you got low slots left over for stuff like inertial stabilizers and nanofibers (although it's probably better to stuff them full of power diagnostics to further boost your shield), but your tank tends to use up most of your mid slots. Gallente can shield tank some of their haulers (eg, the nereus does well in that regard, there are even some battle nereus trolling/baiting fits around), but their T2 haulers have armor bonuses.
---
Personally, i fly minmatar and gallente.
---
I had minmatar industrial 5 on my trade/hauling alt from way back in the day. I also had some refunded skill points sitting around from the time CCP scrapped the learning skills (about 1.5 million SP, so it was like 3 injectors), so i also got gallente industrial lvl5.
---
The reason i picked Gallente is not their base haulers (i wouldn't haul anything valuable in a tech1 hauler, it's basically a death wish), but the versatility of the Occator. It does not get as high EHP as an Impel, but you can still get a fat buffer tank on it with faction hardeners and also have a triple-prop setup (MWD, AB and MJD) which is really handy in a lot of cases.
---
In comparison, i've seen blingy fits for the Impel that can push 700k EHP or more with the right skills (in fact, i think i saw one close to a million EHP, lol). However, it's the most "brick like" to fly out of a class that already feels like flying a baththub. Why should you care about agility though? Well, it's important because you depend on it to be able to do the cloak-mwd trick. Finally, it only has 2 mid slots, which limit it's versatility quite a bit.
---
The bustard is generally good and i like its looks. However, due to the popularity (and cost) of faction shield modules, it gets quite a bit more expensive to fit a comparable tank to the other two. A few months ago when i was comparing DSTs and deciding, i found out that i needed about 2 billion isk for the Bustard to achieve the same EHP that an Occator gave me with a 1.2 billion fit.
---
The Mastodon is probably a weaker bustard (it's also shield tank bonused) so it's not a very good choice.
---
However, the minmatar excel in blockade runners, with Prowler being probably the best (agility and speed) . The Viator (again, Gallente) is a close second due to the fact that it has the smallest in-game model, which makes it a bit harder to get decloaked.
---
Scroll to the bottom of this thread, look at those flairs

Yeah, because it's all some big conspiracy by CCP to conceal their real agenda....
---
The flat earther convention is that way ----&gt;

Wow so aggressive.
