If the number is below 10b you are not even qualified to say "I'm bad", 30b is a starting point, and 100b means you've became a novice professional pvper

For the exact same reason your title is shit, complete and utter laziness.
---
You will generally get a lot more on average from low-sec sites, yes. The risk is definitely worth it, if you do it smart, the large majority of low-sec systems are completely empty and very few gates are camped besides a select few.
---
Fuck you, I might.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not as impressed with this one as the first one. The first one goes into the main faction lore. The second is more about individuals in EvE space Neither of which are capsuleers. 
---
Still a good read so far though!
---
You‚Äôve answered your own question.
---
RnK pipe bomb 2.0
---
There are two ways to find your killmail:
---
1) In the bottom right of your screen is a notifications feed. Click that and your loss should be there.
---
2) All your kills and deaths can be found from your character sheet. To do that, click on your portrait in the top left then click on Interactions and from there click on Combat Log then Show Losses.
---
Convoing or sending a mail to whoever killed you is a great way to get advice and make friends.
---
&gt; No, I can't read your mind
---
Then *maybe* you don‚Äôt know whether I liked you before all this or not.
---
&gt; I can just read what you've written. And you've said a bunch of times both before and after the it was entirely possible that I did what I was accused of, even after CCP said they were wrong and the whole thing was a mistake.
---
Again, apparently you only selectively read my post history. Which is fine. You‚Äôre a busy guy.
---
&gt; I never threatened CCP with a lawsuit. I never needed to. As I have said multiple times, as soon as we started talking, they did the right thing. It never had to go any farther.
---
I don‚Äôt feel like digging up where you said you were in touch with attorneys or the other things you said about it because you‚Äôd just find some way to warp that around to fit. I‚Äôm tired.
---
&gt; All of the parts of the story are public now - it had nothing to do with market manipulation or any of that nonsense. 
---
Ok. I‚Äôm gonna go take my interesting market reports and find some way to make sense of them a different way.
---
&gt; One of my guys sold a Molok, somebody thought he did so because of leaks, conclusions were jumped to, and the rest is history. None of it happened. It was a mistake.
---
That truthfully sounds retarded. So how does the supposed CSM ratting on you figure in?
---
&gt; The only bile and fury I have are for idiots like you who keep claiming that I did something wrong despite being cleared. 
---
Mmhmm.
---
&gt; That's the one part of this whole thing that I still find annoying. Folks rushed to believe CCP when this whole thing went down, then refused to believe them when they accepted they made a mistake and owned up. 
---
I actually didn‚Äôt rush to believe then but heyyyy you just read what I wrote so whatever there.
---
&gt; That pisses me off because they could not have been more clear, and I denied breaking the NDA from the beginning.
---
Welp, you‚Äôre right. Wrongfully accused and absolutely no holes in the story. Just three dudes getting banned for one Molok sale and all the details are definitely out in the open despite the fact that none of that makes sense and there‚Äôs definitely no unanswered questions.
---
What part of this is fucking difficult for you dude? CCP‚Äôs vague ass statement had less plot holes than the story as you‚Äôve told it and I legitimately thought you were a smart dude and yet you cannot figure out why people don‚Äôt believe you.
---
&gt; Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
---
I don‚Äôt know dude, you say this but you‚Äôre arguing with me over whether I ever liked you.
---
Yea, there are ghost sites and sleeper catches there.

Sounds interesting, but you may want to start with a more limited scope so that you can be more effective as a smaller group. It takes time to grow a group and time to learn how to manage an organization. You could take a look at how Signal Cartel evolved and grew, and learn a few useful lessons.
---
Ummm. You form a corp, advertise your corp and its mission to the rest of eve, recruit people interested in your vision, build your infrastructure and logistics or whatever with the help of your recruits, and wala, you're playing eve.

Certain enough to be able to assume that losing the CSM would not adversely affect the game and would likely be beneficial or bring no change at all.
---
&gt;Despite the fact that you've also claimed that we don't know about said ideas because they are only presented to the CSM?
---
We "know" things because of the CSM meeting minutes and the fact that shit ideas end up in game.
---
Use Directional Scan all the time, check on the overview what celestials are nearby and try to stay out of DScan range from gates.

Does anyone really have any business being on the CSM? Let's be real.
---
Im a goon so i wouldn't be suprised if i did. :p
---
Low is really not that scary. Especially if you are in a cov ops or an astero and can cloak. You should be able to find a bunch of empty systems were you can scan and run them in peace. Use the in game map and set it to"ships destroyed in the last hour" if you see a lot in a area just avoid it. You could also use http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/ if you are worried about campus but your cloak should make them a non-issue.
---
except you'r wrong
---
EVE is about the friendships you make along the way
---
A positive comment. How rare!?
---
But for real, thank you. I guess it's just a matter of finding like minded pilots, more and more reading/understanding of mechanics and time lol. 
---
Fuck me for trying to inspire creativity and discussion tho damn...
---
Yeah, was not going to vote for this dude from the first time I heard his voice in this interview, let alone this part of the interview.
---
Stay out of Lowsec, it's a wasteland. Join a Lullsec Alliance and rat nearly worry free. CCP has made the game very easy to make isk, use it to your advantage.
---
Oh duh!
---
I knew I forgot something.
---
You should join a corp it makes the game 100% better
---
Personally I‚Äôd recommend Pandemic Horde for nullsec and Aideron Robotics for lowsec faction warfare, they‚Äôll teach you some PVP, teach you ways to make good ISK (eg FW complex running or mission, VNI ratting), and give you free ships and skillbooks.
---
This post is purely satire and doesn't not represent my opinion of Matterall
---
I can only go by what I recall you saying, and the fact that you're flying INIT flair. But hey - if you were saying nice things before, then I don't know why you're not giving me the benefit of the doubt when it comes to this thing.
---
I said in my first post that I would "seek all available avenues for recourse" and people instantly viewed that as a lawsuit threat, which it wasn't. I'm a lawyer - I don't make threats, I just do what needs to be done. Like I said, it never went that way because it didn't have to.
---
Meta Show went through it - the guy who bought the Molok and thought it was sold because of leaks went to a CSM member to complain. 
---
The fucking difficult part is that they said it flat out: "Neither Brisc Rubal nor the other players implicated in this incident breached CCP‚Äôs confidentiality, the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, or used privileged information to obtain an in-game advantage."
---
There's no wiggle room in that sentence. I was accused of breaching the NDA and leaking info to two other players who used the info for their benefit. The final statement flat out said we didn't do it. 
---
I'm not arguing with you over whether you liked me. I'm telling you you're being a douchebag by insinuating that I did something wrong and just bullied CCP into clearing me. That didn't happen. 
---
It. Was. A. Mistake.
---
Main goal my dude. 
---
Whole idea was to waste your time and invoke this comment.. done.
---
Fair enough, and you are right about the evolving story regarding the deal, it changed quite a bit after it was announced, especially depending on who was telling it.
---
Honestly from my perspective it doesn't seem like there was something sneaky on the part of gotg, they were offered a way out of a conflict with a 6 month truce and they took it. I think Aryth however accomplished two pretty incredible things, he not only gave the Imperium a way out of a conflict that was already costing the Imperium FCs to be burn out on the game, but he did so in a way that pretty much killed any unity that the north had left, he divided the North and the Imperium is now conquering it.
---
I saw Sort Dragon as a the Imperium useful idiot with that deal, but nothing more cynical than that.
---
Of course, i could be wrong, and there was a secret provision in that deal that called for gotg assistance in another war against panfam a year later, guess we'll only know that for certain whenever we get an Empires of Eve book covering this conflict.
---
Even those Captcha methods have been passable by bots for a while.
---
Lol
---
Yeah well. People asked 'what do I do" and the natural negative nature here said "whatever you want". 
---
So I tried to create discussion and pitch my idea?. I'm doing what I want. If it works... sweet. 
---
If not.. well atleast I learned how to play Eve. Which is all you guys bitch about anway. 
---
So why not try and do something new for the rare few pilots that maybe like it. Have to start somewhere right?

But really just go straight to Null, exploration is quite profitable in parts of null. Sansha &gt; Guristas &gt; Serpentis on the last article I found that mentioned how valuable each faction was, with the other factions being essentially worthless.
---
Providence is a really great place to dip your toes into exploration, if you are neutral and not cherry picking it is pretty unlikely that you are going to get killed.
---
This place is just so bitter. I may have been passive from reading the other comments and just seeing this sub in general. I was defensive, my bad.
---
Test yet again proving how stupid they are
---
&gt; We "know" things because of the CSM meeting minutes and the fact that shit ideas end up in game.
---
So what you are saying is that we the community could in fact obtain information about these changes and make a ruckus before they were implemented but in fact we know nothing because CCP only tells the CSM and we never hear about it?
---
Frat hasn't even been around 5 years yet and they've already cracked the top 25 botting alliances of all time list a head of many groups that have been here 10 years or more. Frat bots like its going out of style and now everyone knows it.

I would be so disappointed in the eve community if he makes it on to the CSM after that, but honestly, I'm likely in the minority on that view.
---
I fscking hate people that kill brand new players. I once killed a guy who was 6 days old only to discover he was in a wormhole exploring with all civilian level equipment. I felt so bad I gave him a bunch of iskies and talked to him for a couple of hours about jspace exploration and how to do it right(at least as well as I know what's right).
---
Did any of these people give you any compensatory isk for their low, scummy behaviour? Did they offer you nay advice or even try to chat to you after the kill? If not, please post their player names and I'll sic some mercenaries on their arses.
---
Local indicates if there is anyone in the system with you and dscan will show you uncloaked ships and what they are (within a certain range). The best advice I can give you is to get on youtube and find some tutorials on using dscan and staying safe. I know of a couple so hold on and I will find them for you.
---
and anyone else can buy pirate ammo without wasting the effort of buying plex to get it.
---
Are you ratting and mining solo? If so, think about joining a corp that‚Äôs recruiting on r/evejobs. Tag along with them on group ratting or mining fleets and learn from them.
---
even goons hate the idea of gold ammo, fuck that guy and his stupid ideas, they can't be kept far enough away from CCP devs.
---
INB4 the inevitable "EVE is dying because of the possibility of aesthetic fixes coming before rebalancing the game in favor of whatever it is that most directly benefits my personal play style" post(s).
---
What about the system do you think is going to guarantee nullsec the majority of seats?
---
To put my cards on the table just a bit, I think you're objecting to the voting system because you don't like being a member of a minority. I can understand and sympathize (wormholer btw), but I don't think taking it out on STV is going to help anything.
---
&gt; I can only go by what I recall you saying, and the fact that you're flying INIT flair. But hey - if you were saying nice things before, then I don't know why you're not giving me the benefit of the doubt when it comes to this thing.
---
Because I tried and it doesn‚Äôt make any fucking sense. Come up with an explanation that actually answers all the plot holes I‚Äôve even pointed out here, in this thread.
---
&gt; I said in my first post that I would "seek all available avenues for recourse" and people instantly viewed that as a lawsuit threat, which it wasn't. I'm a lawyer
---
You said some other stuff too. Probably out of anger.
---
&gt;  I don't make threats, I just do what needs to be done. Like I said, it never went that way because it didn't have to.
---
Ok.
---
&gt; Meta Show went through it - the guy who bought the Molok and thought it was sold because of leaks went to a CSM member to complain.
---
What leaks would‚Äôve made a Molok sale suspicious? The Fax nerfs? Ok. Fine. That makes legitimately no sense at all but sure I guess CCP really doesn‚Äôt know how to play their game. 
---
&gt; The fucking difficult part is that they said it flat out: "Neither Brisc Rubal nor the other players implicated in this incident breached CCP‚Äôs confidentiality, the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, or used privileged information to obtain an in-game advantage."
---
After having previously said they were. Why trust them for either, if you don‚Äôt trust them for one? And how can I trust them for both given they‚Äôre contradictory? When faced with contradictory evidence, how does one proceed?
---
&gt; There's no wiggle room in that sentence. I was accused of breaching the NDA and leaking info to two other players who used the info for their benefit. The final statement flat out said we didn't do it.
---
Again, contradictions. And seriously just...a Molok sale? Ok. Fine. You win. That‚Äôs the most garbage explanation I‚Äôve literally ever heard and I‚Äôm still never going to be a fan of yours like I used to be.
---
&gt; I'm not arguing with you over whether you liked me. I'm telling you you're being a douchebag by insinuating that I did something wrong and just bullied CCP into clearing me. That didn't happen.
---
You did fucking argue with me. Not even that long ago. Fuck‚Äôs sake. And this is entirely why I don‚Äôt like you any more.
---
&gt; It. Was. A. Mistake.
---
And were they also really confused about the statement regarding the CSM turning you in? How is that involved at all? How does that add in? How does a Molok sale make any sense at all in this context?
---
Fuck it. You win. I‚Äôll never say another fucking word about it again.
---
Also I‚Äôve had the fucking init flair since the HK keepstar.

The same way you would in real life, you must touch the lives of many people in some way.

The guy who third parties the two idiots while they flail around with ships they don't know how to fly.

1 input huh?  So which mod are you not turning on your web or your point, and why didn't you fit a prop mod and how do you deal damage with guns or drones both of which you have to trigger?
---
Published by an EA/Blizzard partnership and Developed by Riot Games
---
Not quite. In most cases the CSM minutes are released much later, but even if you could, CCP can just hide behind CSM and ignore the community, which is the purpose of the CSM and why its bad.
---
Enemy fleet lands....  
---
"Oh shit boys, bounce"

So you wouldn't gold bullets if they could be bought directly instead of having to buy MTX ingame cash first?
---
If they are still going in 3 months, my corp will have lost 100% of its members.

Simply too hard for Alpha clone players, and in remote quiet areas simply not enough players for pick up groups in Australian time zone.   
---
Webbed, warp scrammed, neuted, sensor dampened and dead without firing a shot may be an accurate introduction to EVE PvP, but it won't make them want to subscribe.  It just highlights why content designed for a playerbase that is 10+ years skilled / ISKed does not work well for month one toons in 1.0 space that got invaded.
---
&gt;faction ammo (or whatever else I want).
---
anyone with isk can buy the same thing and fit it the same way.
---
Time and patience is the name of the game here I guess. 
---
I've been trying to be as active in my corp as possible and looking to progress kind of wide at this point. Little PI here, exploration and rating there. The pvp aspect is a pain really. Right now I can't explore the main channel to low sec in our system due to a bunch of hunters claiming territory. Which my Corp doesn't want to engage too much since we just moved there. It's all T2/T3 tacklers and stuff. 
---
Trying though.
---
In game open your character sheet and the interaction tab, combat log, sort by losses. Also, D-SCAN D-SCAN D-SCAN! if you see nay ships or probes, bounce! Learn to set safe spot bookmarks, lots of them, criss crossing the system. Warp to them randomly when you bounce and keep moving. Land, initiate warp to the next.
---
Even if, the RMT stuff still stands tall. FRT was built, at least in part, on the back of Noraus's credit card.
---
so we should elect him so CCP can ignore his input on community outreach which they have repeatedly stated and shown is not a priority for them. And hope that they ignore his input on them monetizing and pay-to-winning the fuck out of the game.
---
just remember to change it back to low before you have 5000 ships on the screen at once and then exceed the 32 bit memory limit.
---
Please stop trying to convert every new player into a spodbrain
---
You said your not scared of their abilities below, so what is the issue? 
---
You seem to not like them and your not worried about them per your own words, so don‚Äôt fly them. Let those who do enjoy. No problems.
---
Sansha's aren't robots, they're people who's brains and spinal cords have been computer hijacked in order to serve as a meat puppet for the greater good of the Nation, but are still technically alive and I believe to some level conscious. So, they can have families, technically!
---
Why not 2 leshaks and blast through the site even faster?
---
&gt; doesn't not
---
The most dangerous places in lowsec are the connecting systems between high and low and low and null. As long as you stay away from those areas it's fine.
---
Really tho i reccomend using wormholes in lowsec to find your way to nullsec and do exploration there.
---
Fixed it
---
&gt; CCP can just hide behind CSM and ignore the community,
---
They do not need the CSM to ignore the community.
---
You post makes no sense. You can buy pirate ammo as a day one new player running missions without ever needing to swipe a credit card. You would have been better off comparing gold ammo to injectors/extractors. But even that is not a direct pay to win scenario, just because you inject your way into a super doesn't mean you know how to fly or use it. But gold ammo is an issue because it doesn't require skill, there is no learning to use it,  its a guaranteed advantage only obtainable by way of a cash transaction that you can't get unless you also are willing to pay cash.  And if they introduce a "gold ammo" that can be bought in-game for isk without any cash transaction be needed, then it wouldn't actually be "gold ammo" in the traditional sense and they would simply be adding a new ammo to the game.

&gt; Honestly from my perspective it doesn't seem like there was something sneaky on the part of gotg, they were offered a way out of a conflict with a 6 month truce and they took it.

Sure, except that realistically they were getting a six month reprieve anyways due to the current dynamics, and again Goons were already starting to draw down. It's debatable whether that's "suspicious" or not.
---
&gt;  I think Aryth however accomplished two pretty incredible things, he not only gave the Imperium a way out of a conflict that was already costing the Imperium FCs to be burn out on the game, but he did so in a way that pretty much killed any unity that the north had left

You're 100% on that one, but it takes two to tango, which suggests that there wasn't much unity left for him to break.
---
&gt; he divided the North and the Imperium is now conquering it. 
---
Ehhhh. Conquering is a funny phrase for what they're doing, Attacking someone, not taking any territory, not gaining any kind of fiscal gain from it...but sure, besides your phrasing I agree with the point, but *again* I'll reiterate what I pointed out above, there wasn't exactly much unity left.
---
&gt; I saw Sort Dragon as a the Imperium useful idiot with that deal, but nothing more cynical than that. Of course, i could be wrong, and there was a secret provision in that deal that called for gotg assistance in another war against panfam a year later, guess we'll only know that for certain whenever we get an Empires of Eve book covering this conflict.
---
Ehhh, brush up on Sort's history. I take it at face value, but face value looks like Goons buying a new puppet. As far as the book, people seem to still believe a bunch of things that the book dispelled about previous wars so who really knows.

Music ?

Tell that to CCP

I'm familiar with reddit's negativity... just taken back with the nature of it here.

I used to be in Ushra Khan back in the day. So no, I don't feel sorry for CVA, they are a tenacious lot. They have held provi for this long because no-one can take it from them and hold it.

There should be a button in the top-right that says something along the lines of "Board Your Corvette", which should spawn your free ship.

After a while eve will permanently change how you view all interactions in game or in RL. You'll have a newfound paranoia for every sketchy bullshit thing.

&gt; PS2: The bot has problems. I'm not making it up. Here is a TEST guy talking about the same thing. Jin'taan confirming happened to him too. Whenever I begin sending messages to the mod team it's always the same thing.
---
If you read what I told you, I'm in that twitter thread. That guy had no problems on our end, what so ever. There's no bot issues. If you want to avoid problems in the future don't make brand new alt accounts and try to make new threads (if you do, expect a delay while it's still brand new). If you repost it a massive amount of duplicate text, contact the mods right away (and explain the situation, please) or it's going to get spammed by default.
---
Yeah i know they aren't taking any territory, but there is an argument to be made about the economic destruction of your opponent to be a form of conquest, territory is only useful if you can actually profit from it, denying your enemy the ability to profit from their territory impacts their ability to resist against you. Plus the destruction of tribute could push NC. renters to rent from someone else, further damaging your enemy ability to build up forces against you. So i think its an indirect form of conquest.
---
Have the same taste in music!  Really enjoyed the video, especially because I was a neut flying around this area during this!
---
It's actually working as intended. Spam is a bit of an issue - especially from botting websites - so we have controls on new accounts. Nearly every subreddit does actually. Duplicate posts are also a common thing because people will spam submit links using multiple accounts (actual spam as in "pls buy viagra"). There's no actual problem here and his issue can be solved by just giving any mod on the team a bit of a heads up if he plans on doing something weird (such as trying to post his ballot on an alt account). If his post gets removed, PM mods and we get to it when someone is available. Typical turn around time for mod mail is about an hour.

He doesn't have the ability to ask questions to ccp now when they are on his show, how is he going to tell them its a bad fucking idea and you shouldn't do it?   He's just terrible all around.   I'm going to listen to the pro's and con's... I mean thanks for basic meeting 101, are you going to stop saying ummm anytime soon?    You lack a true agenda and just want to be on the CSM and your alliance didn't have a better candidate list to choose from.

I made the original post on my own account. There is literally no reason whatsoever for me to make an alt account, UNDER MY NAME, then post an important non-troll idea article on an alt instead of my main. 
---
It got autoremoved because your automod is problematic. You are saying there are no issues. But I am experiencing them. I don't know how reddit works. I don't know how your bot works. But this isn't the first time my posts got shadowbanned immediately after posting. And many times comments as well. This is literally why we had a conversation in the mod chat last time, which also almost got me banned.
---
So here is the breakdown of how things happened, which you insist on not getting:
---
1) I posted on the very first post my original account. It got autoremoved. It happened for my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bybagf/analysis_krabbification_of_eve_wall_of_text/) as well. That previous post waited 6 hours for someone to approve. Then it didn't get the attention it deserved. I didn't want the same for this post. So I DELETED IT, so that I can create an alt, and post on an alt. I didn't want it to be such that, when I create an alt and post goes through, a mod approves my original post, therefore causing double post.
---
So that's why you aren't seeing the very first original post. That is why the alt post you are seeing is earlier than the main post you are seeing. Because I deleted the very first one.
---
2) THEN posted on an alt. Realized it got autoremoved as well. Didn't bother to delete.
---
3) THEN posted on a friend, deleted again.
---
4) THEN posted on my main again, so at least I can get it across, you can manually approve after some 4 hours, so a few people can read it. 
---
Again, there is an issue with the automod. This time I think it began with me [posting the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bybagf/analysis_krabbification_of_eve_wall_of_text/) with a wrong title, deleting it, and posting it again. My comments are currently working. I am not sure if it's fixed for my posts.
---
Trust me, when I really want to avoid giving you a reason to ban me in the very election season I won't go around try to post on alts out of nowhere.
---
Sansha is very populated though for the same reason, both in natives and roaming explorers. It's the reason I go there, to get dank explorer kills, but a newbie trying to make money might have better luck in Serpentis or Guristas. Or they might just learn quickly to watch local, D-scan, and grid while hacking.
---
The credit card warrior is also going to lose the ship sooner or later, and from then on he'll be marked as a flying loot box. So he'll end up being baited and killed if he tries that again.
---
And you can feed that worm to a cloaky arty loki sitting 40km off the acceration gate into a novice plex
---
Imagine a union asking union members to vote for people who they feel best represent their union.
---
So let's start with the *positive*!
---
Awesome idea man! Have you looked into signal cartel, eve uni, and a few of the other established groups that like to help out all kinds of players? Protection, education, saving lost pilots, etc.
---
It's a great change of pace and something different, I'm sure these groups would take you in. That would give you a chance to see how they do it, and what you might do different. Great step 1 for your idea, and you could even find your first batch of eager peacekeepers!
---
Anything engaging is a plus for eve, and helping out newbros never hurt anyone! Power to ya!
---
Now, the reasons I see the badmen are being nasty.
---
First I would say is your post is insincere. 
---
The second paragraph is just fluff - you make it very clear you are here to pitch your idea. Not saying you aren't interested in how others got famous, but it is very clear you are here for your second question. 
---
Second, "on and off since 09" makes it seem like eve really isn't your life's passion (not that it has to be). With the scope you have in mind, people will have to dedicate hard work, sp, time, and other resources to see it through. They will want a leader putting in their fair share of time and effort. If you just disappear for a month, they will find other places to spend their time. 
---
Third, this is Eve. If you can post on Reddit asking for help, you can research the existing groups already doing (some of) what you want to. No one wants to hold your hand through a project like this, or be the first volunteer. It helps to have already taken action or attempted to before asking for help. If you can show your success and progress- or even what you learned in failure, people know you aren't just all talk.
---
Please don't give a pessimistic snarky response, just go do what you want in eve. Skybox is the limit!
---
Wow so cool!!!!!!
---
you mean they warp to belts afk for 15 minutes then warp to another?
---
I‚Äôm imagining thousands of players trying to do the captcha during heavy tidi..
---
Funny, no director in BFL would say BFF, as it's Black Frog Logistics.   
---
If you are really a director, which I doubt because we are usually more polite than you are, get in touch with me or Fel please.
---
haha maybe they should attack in this defensive war haha
---
&gt; implying that isn‚Äôt how turret damage currently work.
---
Tiny minority. If local were delayed in null, most botting would end and only some VNIs would remain. Can't bot Machs, Rattles, Bargs or caps with delayed local because log-off traps would completely counter it.
---
My ballot must be screwed up, I can't find StainGuy... 
---
Would I be able to write him in?
---
"Doctor, when I do this, it hurts!".  "Well, don't do that then."
---
This is fair enough. I think a side effect is that it's moderating people who delete their post and post it again quickly. Sometimes I post something, realize erroneous title, delete it and post it again. But when that happens your other posts keep getting automodded too. Is this intended? 
---
Anyway at least now I know to be careful about titles.
---
Some pirates are flying faction frigs right? Can‚Äôt they sell it and buy an entire planet or something lmao
---
dying is the best way to get better.
---
Purposefully adding friction to in game mechanics/gameplay?   
---
  
---
How far we've come...
---
Yes FBI, this post right here
---
I'm a fucking nobody lol, coordinate with whom? Of course your average goon would deny any of what I'm saying. Who would want to believe that their coalition is killing the game. Who would want to accept that their coalition exploits their line members so openly. Who would openly accept that their coalition is propagating Tranquility's largest blue donut?
---
A spod brain would never accept any of it. The smarter goons take advantage of the cheap mins, and promote the fostering of spod brains. They don't give a fuck if they can follow basic orders. As long as they can give them those cheap mins and market opportunities, then all is good.
---
Like  [Chiyachan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chiyachan/) said, I can assure you that Black Frog and PushX really are neutral. Not to say none of us are part of any other big alliance with their main or alts, but we get ganked and killed by all sorts of people. If me or any other director found about a cyno or a JF **in corp** used for anything other than our business he will get the boot.   
---
So tell us, what make your thing we are not?
---
We are neither. (check out the killboard)
---
Incidentally, some quick maths. For the mega-pack of 2860 PLEX with the discount, that's 2.6 cents per PLEX (not including tax).
---
A 1-month subscription to Eve is about equivalent to 3 cents per PLEX, a 3-month is approximately 2.59 cents per PLEX, and so on.
---
The official eve mega-mongo $500 PLEX pack comes to 3.25 cents per PLEX.
---
Stops the ship from moving.   Not really a good protip.
---
Makes sense actually. I agree.
---
Good stuff looks like fun
---
Ahhh gotcha.
---
Yes it is. Just stay away from HS/NS connections.
---
Thought that was ctrl-space.
---
seems like you're the one obsessed with him mate
---
I'm gay
---
hmm.. yeah, you're right. :)  still.... I wouldn't want my ctrl key to accidentally stick when I'm spamming the dscan.
---
TIL they upped the recruitment scam level to 11 after I left
---
My bad.
---
Thanks for the honest, sometimes it hurt to hear. But that's were self improvement starts. 
---
Now, one thing is.. I should probably work on my writing. In all honesty, I WAS trying to start a discussion and gain some insight from the vets here. I'm sorry if that came out as fluff, my goal wasn't to pitch a get rich/ scheme. I may have been a bit inebriated writing this and got side tracked with my ideas. 
---
The snarkness, well need to work on that too. It's hard to jot be defensive when all I see is nasty comments, maybe I'm reading into them wrong.
---
So, with that out of the way. I see what you mean about reliability and my goal is to change that. Personally I have been reading the wiki, zkill, dotlan... any info I can get my hands on. I've gotten so bored of any other game that i almost quit till I remembered EVE again and decided to commit to its depths. 
---
I appreciate both your positivity and your criticism. If anything it's  exactly what I needed to hear.
---
Something I never see people say is to take d scan off the window and make it like an over view window just by its self and use it with out the system map.
---
That was just bad
---
&gt;no wh candidates
---
&gt;exooki is literally second in the ballot
---
??
---
No, see, with StainGuy making shit up, I can too.
---
No, didn‚Äôt hear from either of them unfortunately.    But no hard feelings....maybe someday I‚Äôll get to pay it back to them.  Thanks for the tips on local and Dscan though!  I‚Äôll start checking out those videos now.
---
You mean the ones he dropped in your sov?
---
which is even worse
---
To be a true triglav knife, it can only have one blade ü§´
---
since that would make it just another ammo type and totally sidesteps the issues of p2w..what's your argument?
---
That us exactly what pay to win means.
---
Buying an advantage with rl cash.
---
We don't need someone like this on the CSM
---
perfection.jpg
---
Goons will break it like they did woth bookmarks. Thanks for "you can move only 10 at once" mechanic.
---
I've been playing for 7 years. I'm still shit.
---
Probably because the fix would hurt the innocent as much as the guilty?
---
Oh to be a bright-eyed newbie again...
---
I like your effort, message LordGirl Flowers, Ill give you 25 mill. You're doing stuff, I just sit in the damn station
---
It's true Provi has come a long way but they've been the whipping boy of null coalitions for a very long time. Literally everyone has more supers so yeah they are the underdog.
---
EvE-Scout. Only time I'm near anything more populated than the Uedama gate is when we attend memorial events, and those are scheduled way in advance.
---
I shop at Amarr because Jita undock gives my PC panic attacks.
---
I scan all day so I don‚Äôt care.
---
Should have crashed the god damn gate instead of believing that instant lock Lachesis wouldn't scram me
---
That's why I only kill sleepers
---
Guristas are ok. They have a sort of love-hate relationship with the Caldari Navy.
---
Mmmm that *Robopocalypse* hijacking
---
Paying $ to sub
---
Did you have a reason to evict or was it just for the content?
---
Just curious tbh, either way looked like a ton of fun.
---
Is there any ship that can't get insta-lockability solo? I have been insta-locked by quite a few gate campers in my time. Also, can a ship with less than 2 second align be insta-locked still?
---
I am proud to say I haven't touched a POS in over a year and I don't miss them.
---
Why would he want a pay cut to go work in dark and cold iceland when he lives and works in warm and bright LA?
---
Hitting return on a buy order adjustment on 40 Elite Drone AI's from a value of 3.6 million to 36 million (and .01) in Rens 2 years ago - I still remember that moment - I was poor then and it hurt. 1.45 billion poof! My biggest market pvp loss ever.
---
Please never give anyone advice again.
---
And i point you back to my original comment, the implication of which is that they don't need such a cover to ignore the community and you are quite naive if you think that it makes it any easier.
---
matterall is stupid as fuck but eve should do more to strengthen its brand outside of the limited market of people playing the game and enduring the massive time investment
---
world of warcraft is a great brand and having classic come out and seeing how many people genuinely have a connection with the classic lore is amazing and other companies should take note.
---
talking about releasing books, and generally releasing other nonshit products is something i could get behind but i have no idea why some random fucking mongo csm candidate thinks that's an issue theyd have to deliberate in a meaningful way is pretty funny
---
I stole a Nyx the same way about 5 years back with the same mechanic...
---
Nobody tell this man how the majority play this game, his world may crumble.
---
This.
---
Whenever I see a battle report with a bunch of Frat Titans, I always wonder how many of them came from RMT. Sad, but it‚Äôs probably true.
---
Wow that seems like a great comparison.
---
Have you taken 5th grade science yet?
---
You just moved that goalpost again. You're really bad at this.
---
All games are different. All are affected differently, but **all** of them are affected negatively. 
---
Personally I've seen bots in WoW since it launched and they are worse now. Guild Wars 2 had them at launch and it was blatant and unrelenting. The economy is wrecked, there are spam ads constantly in chat and mail, and those are just the MMOs that I have personally seen them in recently. There were rumors of bots when I played EQ and DAoC as well, and that was quite a while ago. I don't really know that anyone will be able to illustrate this in any way that will satisfy you, but we can get out some crayons or something and try to get it down to your level if you really want.
---
If one were to not vote for Matterll, Pray tell Mr. Bunny, who should be voted for?
---
Lmao imagine the mental gymbastics to try and make up a situation in which eve is not obviously p2w.
---
Hey glad you enjoyed it! Music is listed in the description of the video. If you know of any other artists with similar sounds pls do lmk cause it‚Äôs been hard for me to find similar sounding tracks
---
All the ISK I make, the great, fun guys I hang with, the boatloads of SRP that you could profit from, all the free ships, and an almost limitless supply of resources make me disagree with you.
---
It's not goons fault that other power blocs couldn't or wouldn't reach that level of economic and military power. *Especially after goons got their shit kicked in and out of the North during WWB.* Goons aren't invincible but man you sure like stroking their schlong.
---
Y'all are so mad and upset because you're not on the same level as the Imperium. That's it. There's nothing else to it. That's what the sandbox aspect of this shit game was made for. CCP made it possible for a single powerful megabloc to exist, but it's not like they exclusively gave that privilege to Mittani. Also, fuck outta here bro. You're CODE. You guys literally know nothing of nullsec politics, and clearly you know nothing of Goons. You're just some dumb pubbie who follows the "grr goons hat goons" meta because you're upset CODE doesn't have a sov stronghold or a supercap umbrella. 
---
Also I have yet to see any evidence of this exploitation you claimed. I've never been disrespected or put-upon with unreasonable demands or deadlines. I've never been berated, talked down to, yelled at, whatever. You know why? Because I'm not a fucking idiot. The guys who get the negative treatment are the dipshits who 1) refuse to operate with a team, 2) lack the ability to listen to the FC, and 3) don't read pings and die because they decided krabbing during a war was more important than just showing up to 1 goddamn fleet a month. I've spent time with several power blocs in null, and none of them compare to the amount of fun I've had on fleets with Goons.
---
Now I'm not gonna say NCPL are shit and their members are miserable. Not at all. I've talked to players from both alliances, and they all had good stuff to say about their respective residence. That's great, and I'm all for it. I'm not one to poach a happy player away from where he's happy. But bruh, you gotta be either trolling or just have zero clue what you're talking about. Goons have been nothing but good to me. If you were in goons once upon a time and had a bad run, then you're probably just shit and need to reconsider your outlook on this game.
---
You trigger more than a couple ppl. Am proud
---
Gameplay I enjoyed:
---
1. Do Level 5's (for added spice use a Marauder) (ok if you pick the right system it is boring, Marauder will draw attention though) LP is excellent either way.
---
2. Level 2 manufacturing including Reactions - decent isk. The chain is a lot of work, but refining the process and getting a workable, somewhat low effort chain was an interesting challenge.
---
That‚Äôs actually surprising low
---
Not going after that prospect faster and trying to neut him and get off. I knew i was going to die, i left planning to die.
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre remotely close to the same value as the faction frigs we fly, given the difference in performance.
---
Hi, goons poor IRL but rich in game. Goons do not want IRL P2W. Thanks
---
Holy f\*ck dude,  are you still trying to be relevant?
---
&gt; The incursion should be triggered by someone running lvl 5 abyss and encountered the construction site. Can be a pre-arranged streamer. The triglavians simply follows the player while he exit the abyss, turning the system into a invasion Foothold system.
---
And then the trolls start burning a bunch of T5 filaments in the major hubs like Jita, and suddenly chaos.
---
It was a cool looking trailer, but that doesn't mean it ALWAYS goes that way.
---
I'll vote for 2 wet socks before I log into Eve
---
Accidentally sub my accounts again.
---
You are missing the point. Why is it in the community's interest to help them ignore it?
---
Do you actually know how the Australian system works i wonder? Because who you vote for is irrelevant it's a 2 party system meaning even if you vote for greens, they delegate where those votes will go to liberal or labour / also you vote for the party and the person at the head of the party (the prime minister)  can change without a vote / look at the past decade of Aussie politics to see the evidence of that
---
We aren't helping them ignore us. They do not need our help to ignore us and the CSM is neither here nor there as to if or the degree to which they ignore us.
---
Just draw a giant dick on your ballot paper and job done! Ccp will know who you mean
---
Whyd you call it a tl;dr post and not give a tl;dr.
---
And matterall is on noones blocks because be support gold ammo n shit monetisation
---
Seconded!
---
Shows how little you know, ofc.
---
If you vote, you are. They can pretend talking to community without talking to the community.
---
The whole economic destruction angle is a bit of an overplayed card to be honest. It takes very little actual time for wealth to be rebuilt and Goons can only deny the use of a very limited amount of space for short periods of time ultimately, just due to game mechanics and human nature.
---
As far as your comment about renters, it‚Äôs a possibility but Tribute isn‚Äôt the place to hit for that effect and Goons are well aware of it.
---
Your resistance point is interesting but ultimately it means that Goons have ‚Äúconquered‚Äù everyone if we are just using the possibility of resistance as a metric. I don‚Äôt think even they particularly like that, which is why there‚Äôs so much internal spin dancing about this being ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù for WWB. There needs to be a real narrative to push a struggle because otherwise nobody logs in.
---
Overall goons don‚Äôt appear to want to swap back to the decentralized renter model at a large scale, which I frankly applaud them for. We will see if that changes in the future.
---
Taking that math into consideration I hope to wake up tomorrow morning as my capsuleer.
---
I think it becomes fairly difficult to instalock when you move into/past the cruiser size ship. You really end up gimping your fit significantly.
---
If your ping is pretty bad and the gate camper has very low ping or is near the servers in London, they can sometimes lock you in a &lt;2s align ship
---
Dumb argument, yes a shit pilot will still be shit. But you beat and equal skilled pilot easily.
---
ok no tldr then.
---
Real democracies don't really exist in our modern world
---
Yeah, that's about what I figured. I don't see many people doing solo gate-camps, but you get a nasty surprise when it does happen while in a travel fit. I guess like Bedop said, just crash that gate if you have a feeling you won't make the warp in time.
---
Align to a safespot, and stare at your local like a feral paranoiac as soon some comes in warp to your safe bookmark then try to dock up.
---
Systems where the ratting doesn't occur within 15 AU from gate?
---
Spoken like a true caldari loyalist.
---
Just forbid bots. They can't loggin if you forbid them.
---
Sorry dude, I think I pocket down voted you. Normally I'd just leave it but this post isn't doing so hot, so I removed it.
---
&gt; and suddenly chaos.
---
Sounds cool.
---
you should find a WH to nullsec in highsec and then explore there, guristas and sanshas space are the best ive heard (out of areas with high activity obviously, like Delve and Tribute (atm) )
---
Hes voting horde because he may dress it up as anti big bloc but all it is at heart is grr goons nothing more
---
Yeah it may not take a long time to rebuild tribute, and of course while they are away their own home region is under constant harassment, but honestly i don't really see what else they could do, since actual conquest of territory is pretty much out of the question due to how overstretch the imperium would become by taking tribute, burning down NC. and getting some morale points with your coalition members seems to be the best possible option.
---
The only way to learn against being ganked ... is by being ganked.
---
Its simply because he doesn't believe in independent players,  he believes in himself and anyone fighting goons
---
There is one good reason to vote for Materall...shitting on Sort Dragon.
---
I'm a new player who is loving the game (I impulsively bought Omega after 10 hours) and I'd like to find a good Corp for helping newer players but idk where to start. I'm also concerned about being scammed by someone pretending to bring me into a newb friendly Corp. I've just done the career agents and I've been working on the SoE arc and leveling the magic 14 plus some drone skills for my algos, but idk if what I'm doing is time or efficient or is valuable in helping me learn.
---
If you vote thinking you are changing the game you are yes. But voting to chose who is on the CSM isn't.
---
Doesn't matter, people catch on there is ratting happening -&gt; they find out where -&gt; log-off trap -&gt; log in -&gt; dead bot.
---
Dude we literally roam your space daily and see them in action.  Or rather don‚Äôt see them.  Because the warp off the minute neuts hit.  Leave their drones and everything.
---
How would you die to a prospect?
---
nice vid
---
So what?  We feel he has interesting ideas.
---
Whoever the state tells you to vote for
---
1) As a covops you're (mostly) untouchable in gates
---
2) People don't ususaly camp data/relic sites so as you discover one, you only have to take care of combat proves. It's really rare you come across someone trying to scan you in low sec
---
3) low sec is mostly dead, beside the perimeter and connection systems. You can do whatever you wnat in "deep lowsec"
---
Side note: Eve is all about reading implicit language. With experience you can know if someone is trying to catch you or not, so having a neut on system don't always mean you 're being chased. So, lowsec in that aspect is pretty safe for you. Not, in nullsec within alliance sov it's another story. People like to hunt explorers. That requires much more experience to be done. I would consider doing null sec exploration only on deep nullsex with WH access.
---
What you say about the things that are imbalanced are indeed imbalanced, but in a strange way, they balance out and give smaller entities some room to fight against much larger entities and not just make it a 2 day swing roll. 
---
So the changes you suggest are just boosting the n+1 gamestyle that has become so cancerous today, so how do you balance the changes you suggest?
---
Don't judge me üòî
---
Why am i in this picture?
---
Wtb. God mode sub for a moth 100 buks. Deal with it!
---
We will find you and we will kill you.
---
Ooof.  I P2W ammo has no place in EVE and I am not happy this opinion is even a thing :(
---
Covert Cynosural Field Generator
---
I'm a noob and so are my friends, we thought we could take the 3v1 against the 2 year player. We thought wrong.
---
This would negatively effect those who aren't botting and actually playing the game the way its supposed to be played, which is why CCP (Probably) won't do it.
---
This advice changed my life. Thanks
---
you misunderstand. we are confederates, you and me, and I feel the same way.
---
&gt; ... exceed the 32 bit memory limit
---
I guess you haven't heard.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/ps7mbt/the-eve-online-64-bit-open-beta-is-now-live
---
Not quite right. If you see combat probes at all then gtfo . You can be scanned in a single pass at further than 1au by a good hunter.
---
And at that point the site is dead until local is clear.
---
I usually find the official forums recruitment section the best. Found [here](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/corporations-alliances/recruitment-center). Corps will list out what they are about and how to actually apply to them. /r/evejobs can be alright but it's fairly repetitive. 
---
The easiest is to join one of the big null blocs but I don't like that being the only thing people suggest every time this question is asked so I want to stress that isn't the only option for you.
---
Make sure you ask lots of questions and never trust anybody with your assets. Some corps will offer free move in service (1 free jump freighter of your stuff to corp home after you join). But make sure you put collateral on it and cover yourself. Corps should also never have a entry fee or charge you to join. Also make sure you check their zkillboard page and make sure what they are telling you is matching up with that page and they are active in your timezone.
---
I was hoping that invaded system would slowly start losing security status and ultimately turn into triglavian npc null if left long enough uncontested. That would really shake things up
---
True.
---
Feel bad for those that saw the previews of the expansion and resubbed to see what it was all about and enjoy it. That didn't last long.
---
Iirc the difference in performance is due to capsuleers having much better control over their ships because of the mindlink, whereas pirates have individual crewmen operating different parts the ships.
---
Not true. I've never been ganked while exploring because I started by ganking explorers and have seen most mistakes you can make from the other side.
---
Ahh.
---
Redeemed 10 alpha injectors in venal, while doing guristas epic arc, then tried to bring it back to high sec. Lost it to station campin hecate
---
You sure have the terminology down for a noob.
---
Goon pets everywhere but they are 100% shit
---
Provi block has capitals?  Now I know Rorquals are OP if even they can field them...‚Ä¶.
---
My weekend was absofuckinglutly full of them.
---
The most recent was attempting to crash gate in OMS instead of doing the cloak trick. Campers even bumped me towards gate, dual prop doesn't beat webs.
---
Undocking is consent to pvp.
---
A good reason to vote for Materall in your later ballet would be to shaft Sort Dragon.
---
Corp audits your wallet when you're applying. Decides that this transaction looks suspicious. Blacklisted from alliance.
---
Great point, this would just eliminate all ratting
---
fuck you i'll make anime tiddy a REALITY if i get on the csm
---
yea well murder is illegal so why do i still get killed, HUH
---
I was more refering to the convoluted system, which is a bit of a staple of Commonwealth nations from what i've seen.
---
I should have said 'i'm not surprised something as convoluted as this came from a commonwealth nation'.
---
/u/zeroniss1 dude I took a photo of your first response with my phone. I have never seen someone destroyed so absolutely with words. I was literally turned on reading your post, Struggling to work here.   
---
I hope one day I can pass on some fallacy kicking like this. What did you study to smash logic so hard.   
---
/u/rabidwombat34524 You need to watch the movie revolver. Then book in with a \~\~psychologist\~\~Psychiatrist.
---
don't even talk to me if you haven't learned the ways of PAN MAN
---
no he isn't
---
In fact. Fraternity. treasury, where noraus houses his ratting bots, has only existed one year out of the 16 year sample. So it‚Äôs far far worse a picture than even you rightly brought up
---
half of low sec is empty systems, if there's nobody in local but you, there's no risk.
---
ya but when will u touch that palantine keepstar
---
Don't mine in low sec, or stay aligned while you do so you can warp away to a safe bookmark in deep space the moment anyone enters local, and cloak up (this probably means that you mine in something other than a mining barge). 
---
Best to mine in highsec or null (currently everyone in null is at war though so not a lot of mining going on). VNI ratting is probably your best bet, 100MN AB and orbit at correct distance then they can't hit you and your drones can kill them without getting aggro (I found about 33-35km is the correct range or the rats can hit you or they start aggroing your drones, if I remember correctly since its a long time since I VNI ratted).
---
\&gt; MinerDistraction  
---
\&gt; considering
---
Nope
---
it's about selling keepstars to other players as i heard not long ago in a video. what pvp ?
---
10k m¬≥ and any ship that has that amount of space and can warp decently fast 
---
Bookmark at 150k+ and be aligned and ready to warp when they pop. Trick is only the person that clicked the button will know exactly when it unanchors.

spend 100$ , get 2600 plex, inject, get a blingy ship, and die instantly with a juicy killmail because your piloting skills suck. (there is one guy streaming on twitch, he does the same) .We all love these guys! There is no shortcut towards learning how to EVE, not even money can buy it. I was attracted to this game since i was a teenager, in 2003, and at that time, my older friends who played it seemed like demi-gods for understanding EVE, i didn't join because it was too complex for me, but 4 years later i had my first toon, and still today i suck at solo pvp.

You can pop out just the text read out - so every time you hit the button you just get a list of ships near you.
---
One of the biggest problems is not with structure timer distribution. The problem mainly revolves around structure engagements being, time consuming and boring. The second problem is the ridiculous spam-ability of citadels. The combination of the two does help small groups gain a foothold, but allow n+1 groups to go to extremes. 
---
I think finding ways for citadels to act more like the structures they were meant to replace is the solution. Stations had specific uses, and POSs had specific uses. Citadels combine both, while giving even more safety with mechanics like tether. As an example, it is impossible to "bubble fuck" a citadel but that was a key way to trap people and assets in POSs. It was possible to shut down station services like fitting and clone bays. That simply isn't possible with citadels. Meanwhile citadels gain, tether, fighters, PDS, and Keepstar Doomsday. I think there are places for these tools, but they should come with trade offs. If you have PDS, maybe there should be limitations on tether. Or tether being tied to a structure service. Additionally small things like being able to take an ansiblex while pointed / bubbled is idiotic. I understanding the intent to act similar to standard stargates, but they are not. They are replacements for Jump Bridges. Attackers cannot follow through them and they can be anchored within the attack range of Keepstars. Similar issues exist with Cyno Jammers being able to be anchored within Keepstar DD range.
---
Safer to explore in nullsec though
---
You can adjust it to 360degrees and its more realistic to move it to 5au to 20au for close things.
---
You can use your camera to pan the cone unless you are using 360 then obviously its around you.
---
The D-Scan is the most useful tool in exploration and lowsec/nullsec/"WH" navigation.
---
Like you said there is a hotkey "V" or you can just hit scan every second or two.
---
'Supposed to be played' = farming null in perfect safety without a care in the world?
---
CCP won't do it because approximately 98% of the game's population is borderline retarded and not catering to this lowest common denominator results in many unhappy mouth-breathers.
---
Okay thank you for all the good information.
---
All good my dudes. Hopefully the candidates you voted for were people you believe will help the game.
---
&gt;Like you said there is a hotkey "V" or you can just hit scan every second or two.
---
And now you've v started his habit v of pressing v every few moments even v when not playing eve v. v
---
Wich menu I set it to 360? The one it shows upon pressing v?
---
Edit: is Eve University a good place to start?
---
Thats true, but once the sales stopped they skyrocketed. Maybe this will slow the trend for a while.
---
It's in the D-Scan Menu. There is a slider at the bottom where you can adjust the settings.

I don‚Äôt have any experience with them myself but I‚Äôve heard good things in the past.
---
Put a tech 1 cloak on my bomber
---
It's still pay to win. Just because the ship blows up eventually doesn't change that. It's an advantage gained through paying money. Skill may off set some of that but it doesn't make it not p2w.
---
Im glad you didn't say bow.
---
DODGE THIS YOU COWAAAARDS
---
Go to null, some cans have 98 mill plus.
---
Get in an astero and use 4 stabs until u can use dscan properly.  Bring a mobile deposit with u
---
i wish they changed voting where you dont vote for 10, but instead 5.. and then you have another 5 slots for people who you vote AGAINST
---
When you do a character transfer, do all the assets, isk, and plex in the plex vault transfer with it? If not can someone tell me exactly what does transfer? Thanks in advance.
---
thanks for sharing and very lame about the loot.
---
Twasn't the prospect that killed me it was the half a dozen bombers + the stratios he cynoed in. Could have been a great fight if i had stood my ground instead of trying to run away.
---
Small d-scan tip. Check the thing on the dscan UI to not tie it to the camera. Narrow scan angle to 5 degrees. Then when you click V and hold it down and click the anom, asteroid belt, gate or whatever, you want to scan it will dscan the item and show you what is there if it's within the range you have set. Makes scanning anoms and stuff much quicker.
---
Is this terrordestroyer5k 2.0?
---
Sold something and added an extra 0 :(
---
260 mil donation to horde I guess vOv
---
That‚Äôs not true , because no one wants sov in provi , because it‚Äôs a terrible region
---
&gt;~~You made some things?~~
---
I made some things.
---
This is mine now, ship it to me. Use Black frog
---
1) Check you D-scan, figure what is falling in your belt, by adjusting the distance. Stay at 5 AU if something appears go to 1AU, to see if is comming to you. Eventually scan at max distance to check what is going on.
---
2) Keep an eye on local chat, to check who is entering in the system.
---
3) Find a suitable system for your activity. Avoid border systems with HS, find a quiet system for your avtivity, check kills in the system.
---
4) Once you suspect something is falling, align to a safe point and if a ships comes, warp.
---
5) Build a safe point in every system, ( a bookmarked point while you are warping between distant objects).
---
6) Build gate tacticals, those are points far than 150km of the gate, used to see how is the gate, before jumping.
---
7) If you can, fit a warp core stabilizer.
---
Read eve university wiki. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Directional_scanning that was awesome place to seek informatio when i started my game ib 2013.

The hand of stalin/bobxwill guide your shots. Place faith in him.

*you're

And sometimes it's hard to light, but somehow tastes better.
---
Oh you're one of them bogans
---
That explains a lot
---
I was referring to legally.
---
Still seen it. You lose
---
Skill injectors for a frig are kind of nonsense. Normally by the time you get the experience to fly blingy frigs, you have all needed skills already (if you focus on frigs, which you do in the FW).
---
You don't lose your pod often in lowsec, so HG set is significant up-front cost. In a game where you can make 400-1000 mil per hour (some wh shenanigans, rorq mining, or if you prefer not to invest too much into your carebearing activities or leave hisecs - t5 abyss solo or t5 abyss hawks t5 triple-boxing) I cannot imagine why you need to pour your IRL cash to get 500m frig + hg pod.
---
In my corp, which is pretty "elite" by these standards, I do not know anybody who pays with credit card for ingame activities (i knew a few who got decent cash from their ingame activities though! shame that they are banned now).
---
the Newbean
---
Plot twist: ccp writes the code such that invasions have a 0% chance of spawning in Jita (like wormholes). Trolling the trolls.
---
Guys, if you can use isk to buy the same thing that plex buys, it isnt pay to win.
---
Its pay to advance/pay to accel.
---
True pay2win is not something you want to see. Were you cant use isk to purchase it and it requires actual money to buy.
---
Nice smartbombing!
---
Matterall may not be an expert on spaceships, but he is exceptionally nice provided you have something that he wants.
---
He is a very good salesman, in that I have not heard him say something he means in the past 3 years but people seem to lap it up.
---
Sycophancy works wonders I guess.
---
From listening to everything the guy has said about the CSM, I still have no idea what opinions he has. Which, I guess is great if you want a salesman.
---
If we wanted someone to represent the media in Eve, I guess we would have stuck with Bobmon for more than one year, or any of the ones who have represented media in eve before.
---
Nothing I have seen or heard makes me think Matterall would be able to say No to CCP if they come in with a terrible idea.
---
Forgotting to mark my WH exit last night after spotting 2 Phoenixs ratting in a WH and looking like an idiot on discord because of it.
---
Running 350 Sulphuric Acid reactions and cancelling, losing all the Moon Goo and nitrogen blocks, about a 450mil loss, literally first time doing reactions. Also done last night.
---
Yeah I'm a dunce most days.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/OXYUBIw
---
The cinematic shots of us the nightmares killing the capitals was really awesome, glad you did that at the end!
---
In the first part of the video you could see nightmare locking speed... 20 beams hitting a single ship at once, and it exploded.
---
What lore tells you that? Im interested
---
You're wrong idiot
---
Can we have someone verify that the title "THE CSM ELECTIONS OF 2018" is just forgotten from last year and I'm not voting in the wrong election instance or something?
---
Become a space commander for one group and then become a space commander for their enemies. Watch the downvote train trickle in. You'll see what I mean. monkaS
---
What is he going to rat with 1m skill points in null. He should run high sec anoms and make a bank roll and figure out the game first
---
That‚Äôs the joke.
---
Nah fam CCP should make AT into 4 man proper moba with small wormholes as the forest and and plexes as 3 lanes
---
I support a lowsec gate to Stain fyi...
---
The whole Invasion is just a letdown. CCP has no excuse for giving us such BS content, stuff that's essentially just reskinned Incursions. It's not like they didn't know what we wanted.
---
Normally, the character itself keeps everything, as when you do a selling ad on the forums, you also need to precise the balance of the character‚Äôs account, and his/her possessions.
---
Forgot to activate my cloak when encountering a gatecamp
---
Or just take one of the Attack Battlecruiser and F1 anything that come.
---
Yikes, calm down.
---
That... would actually be interesting to see? Weird, but interesting.
---
Your best bet is a C1-C3 wormhole, or nullsec. Don't head directly to nullsec, but when you probe down holes you should be looking for a path to null. Once there you can use your map, and the agency to help find sites and avoid enemies. 
---
Lowsec data and relic sites are more dangerous and less rewarding than either null or Wh. In fact, since I live in the warzone, I have exactly the same amount of risk. Anyone in local could be the one about to land, or decloak. In null it is far easier to find better sites, with empty systems.
---
This is exactly what I thought when I heard his interview. haha
---
It's still a ship with a fully functioning FTL drive, shields, and is capsule compatible. All of those things are probably going to be pretty expensive even for civilizations as advanced as EVE
---
And I'm annoyed it's going to clutter my inventory. Truly, we are petty gods.
---
I'm sorry for trollin.  There's nothing wrong with finding your own corner of happiness is this crazy fucked up world.  More power to you friend
---
yes, it does ;)
---
also a nice idea ;)
---
Mordhau? Pffft, hold my latte while I show you Battletoads.
---
or post a mathematic question based on CCP math ;)
---
Implying CCP listen to anyone on the CSM anyway.
---
Better yet a Battle Royale!
---
Lol the self-proclaimed mastermind of eve turned pet of a pet trying to belittle someone for being a line member. Careful not to trip over your own self righteousness, Jesse.
---
Man i love your shows ... but the recent change of the discord channel colors made me quit it.
---
Hecate is good because it‚Äôs instawarp and you can keep an offline cloak in your utility high to turn on if you‚Äôre being gatecamped or need to afk. 
---
Getting out of a large gatecamp with a t1 cloak is impossible but if it‚Äôs a fairly small one then it‚Äôs not too hard. Just have to crash a few times until you have a good opportunity.
---
I actually like this idea.
---
Fuck this guy
---
I came back last week after a trial account 10 years ago.  I've been using the following sites to find good deals with moderate success:
---
https://evemarketer.com/
---
https://evetrade.space/
---
https://www.evemarkethelper.net/
---
Most easy arbitrage  get picked up quick, so if you have time and money some long-range buy orders might be your game.
---
First off, thank you. 
---
Secondly, care to elaborate? The TiS discord? I don't know what a channel color is in this context.
---
Where do you and Sort keep your bots, Jesse?
---
Main discord icon.      
---
Like 'pride month' ... why to include this in EVE ...          
---
Still waiting on show related to NPC nullsec.
---
Surprised no one has said this yet, but it sounds like your V key is mapped to the probe scan window, and not the d-scan window.
---
I guess you‚Äôll have to first cross the ‚Äúundocking threshold‚Äù?
---
Testing my first bomber against rats. I didn't warp out. Lost the bomber
---
That‚Äôs not it, the problem is by default dscan opens in the system map window, you have to change a setting to make it pop up separately
---
Teesside here too!
---
Are you seriously against people supporting pride month?
---
I dont mind your shitposting StainGuy, but that's a pretty shitty comment right there.
---
This would work if the game didn‚Äôt take 15seconds to load grid when you login now.
---
Was running some abyssal sites in my gila. It was about 400 mil by itself and I had stored up about 400 mil of loot. I gated it up to O-V from where I had been doing sites further inside geminate with no problem, then took the ansiblex to bwf and docked safely. 
---
Except, before I went afk I must have hit undock. Found myself in a pod 200km off the keepstar. Some random Hecate had just flown up and blapped me.
---
CCP said something about 10k new players each months. Even taking into accounts alpha alts and botting VNIs that's a good amount.
---
Ah. I must have forgot about that. Thanks for the correction. 
---
I‚Äôd suggest the op separates them then, as it makes it much easier to use (at least in my opinion).
---
Pretty much what others have said
---
Set your current Overview to a preset that contains the things you want to find, plus some landmarks like stations, belts, etc
---
Open the D-Scan window (ALT+D, or V, or from the radial menu Scanners button)
---
From the dropdown set "Active Overview Filters"
---
Set the sliders : 
---
"Range" all the way to the right, "14.3 AU"
---
"Angle" down to the left, 5 *¬∞*   or 15 *¬∞* 
---
Hover the mouse pointer over the "SCAN" button to check the instructions.
---
Hold the V key down and click something in the Overview, yes the Overview and not the Directional Scanner window.
---
The conical scan will swing to the object you clicked.
---
Set the Overview set to a different tab/preset and press Scan again to see the change in results
---
Tips:
---
Holding V while using the mouse wheel will alter the range
---
Practice by going to a Triglavian Invaision perimeter system. The Triglavians move all over the system and it's good D-scan practice finding out where they are hanging out.
---
Ah, well I appolgize if you don't like it and look forward to your triumphant return next month.
---
Welp. I only voted for 3, but you and 2 others of your ballot are on the list. So it's good to know I made the correct choices.
---
Blazingbunny brought some great points and solutions up. Any guy who wants to fix rorquals and nullsec online has my vote, I don't care which alliance the person is from.
---
Bogan is a way of life, mate. Have you ever enjoyed the pleasure of shooting the shit in your jocks, some thongs, and a nice cold one in hand on a warm summer day?
---
TIS is just a bunch of old dudes rambling because they have maybe a decade of Eve experience and sometimes invite someone which have interesting to say
---
I htink you got so emotional that you forgot a word in your sentence.
---
There is at least one 2 days old char titan loss and I believe that there was someone that maxed all skills with injectors just for the glory. So I think people can afford it...
---
I mean I'm trying to imagine the scene but it's australia and I keep seeing venomous insects every square foot.
---
Jocks? There's a snake in dem dere jocks.
---
Thongs? Spiders. The hairy kind
---
Cold one? Beer-bound parasites.
---
Also venomous.
---
I think those candidates are solid, and for the right reasons!
---
Goons already have the votes of who knows how many thousands just because Goonswarm, so give it a break.
---
I‚Äôve been playing eve for 6 years. I can go get my credit card buy a bunch of plex skill injectors implants and a 500m frigate and immediately get shit on. It has nothing todo with how much money you spend. If you can‚Äôt fly your ship properly you will get shit on by someone who can
---
P much yeah.
---
Australia is nice to tourists though. She hates her citizens.
---
I dont understand how anything I said relates to who goons are voting for.. Infact goons have killah bee on their ballot. 
---
My point if you cant say I'm anti big bloc then put 2/3 big blog members on your list and not exepect flak that's stupid as shit if he wanted to vote independent then he should have voted independent and anti goon.
---
Until it is has more testing, I assume people will be sticking with the 32 bit client.
---
I'm not sure exactly what you mean. Let me put it like this, if a toon that has a container of assets, 100m isk and 500 plex is transferred to me, will I end up with all those things when the transfer happens?
---
I'd love to do this but the Amarr npcs will kill me
---
Just because they are bloc members, it invalidates what any of them have to say? Nice.
---
Dude, I don't know what to tell you. You're acting like it's impossible for somebody to make a mistake and then correct it. And no, there was never any me "saying stuff out of anger." 
---
There are no plot holes. The whole story has been put out in various media. Guy sells a Molok, another guy buys it. Thinks he got ripped off because of changes (FAX nerf, HAW changes), complains about it to CSM member, CSM member goes to CCP, conclusions are jumped to. It's pretty straightforward. Did it make any sense? No. Was it wrong? Yes. That's why CCP corrected it.
---
Edited.  Thanks!
---
You can solo the 3 man frigate abyss by launching 3 filaments with a 300m retribution
---
What ships were you in? And what ship did you try to engage?
---
Sure!
---
Its pretty normal in most games if you buy income time or items and charge back you will get banned/suspended till the bill is settled
---
If it is in media ... like every media, on the streets ... can we keep it outside of New Eden?         
---
Some people play games to have some "rest" from RL.
---
because it doesn't matter at all ..?
---
Goons have their own in house services that covers most space in the game

Oh boy, is this the second account of the guy that posted here lately who thought he was supersmart just because he recently finished 1984 for the first time?

Wowow I didn't allow matt to swim in my gambling money pool... Who took this pic, and damm matt we got to talk!

Your corp idea sounds a lot like CVA/Provi bloc.
---
Discord is social media.
---
I don't see any pride month stuff in New Eden, never have. I understand your point though and truthfully the most mature way to deal with something like that is walk away which you have. So can't fault you there dude.
---
Yeah in case the rest of his platform is any good, guess what, it's not.
---
 Eve is already a battle royale, but everyone has infinite lives.
---
Hammerwerke had it coming.
---
As someone stated, they had negative bushido.
---
Don't bring fights, krab all day no one in WH space is missing them.
---
Very nice.
---
You know... Those ammo loot boxes we got in the 16th birthday event were no coincidence. It was just a test run and people fell for it.
---
Gold Ammo = even more Elite?!
---
Belt ratting can be fine in .2 and .1 systems where those clone transports spawn. Their loot is worth around 20m iirc + 1mil bounty. Can net you an average of 80-120m/h. 
---
Not the best way but it can work when people have fun constantly warping around.
---
What the hot buttered hell is this knuckle fucking nonsense?
---
Spoiler... They wont
---
I voted for both of you...  :P
---
On a side note, I voted for Mike. Only vote I cared about (other than avoiding most GSF candidates to stopdiminish them stacking CSM)
---
&gt; Vote for someone who's too incompetent to understand how an AUTO MOD feature works, and narcissistic enough to think there's bias against him by a literal bot.
---
The largest demographic of eve players are americans and russians.
---
It follows.
---
I love how so many people are saying if it is an equal balance to begin with money will tip the scales, how many fights in eve are equal to begin with? Also, Important stuff like learning to d-scan, pick fights, combat probe, and fit your ship can't be bought, so if one these magically balanced players read guides on the above and the other just bought a fancy ship then money may not be the deciding factor.
---
I was laughing yesterday on discord about how shitty NC was.

Lost a 300 mil Gila because I bumped something and dropped orbit. Rage logged off after.

Stop projecting.

There was a ping and a single post about the election. 
---
Haven't read it, won't read it and I will vote however the fuck I want.

I hadnt heard of you but this information would have been decent enough to add to my ballot as #2.
---
Hope you run again next year.

I went 64bit client, been perfectly fine, better perf. I think it's stable enough to use it regularly atm.

Mostly for content as they never provided any to us. But also because we are on an campaign to clean wormholes from the G-Block which is a coalition of german corps/alliances we strongly dislike.
---
Or shitting on Matterall by voting for Sort Dragon!
---
They crossed the pay to win line with skill injectors already
---
Well unlike all the other candidates he is honest about representing his alliance and not the playerbase on the CSM.
---
I‚Äôd assume that they use T1 ships with paint jobs honestly.

I for one welcome my future electronic overlords! And I will help them find and eradicate the measly mortals for a couple bionic legs n maybe an eye

Anyone but the ones with incredibly stupid ideas.

this game is broken

Nobody has lived in m-o for at least 18months. Sh1 will suck probably.

Titan an hour.delve

by transferring structures to noname corp so it won't show on their killboard ? ha ha

[nope](https://i.imgur.com/IHAKUn9.jpg)

None. CCP said fuck FW and every Nullsec player said fuck Lowsec. We are on our own, no one loves us.
---
Honestly, as much as I hate it too, this is Eve and gaming the system is the name of the game.
---
No, I'm not that invested its just some Top, men ! (and women)
---
To be fair, it's thuesday morning in EU. üòú

this was a terrible mistake

I think Matthew Dust is running the CSM.

You fuel citadels so they aren't low power which reduces their timers.

Anyway you were saying people were salty, which I doubt is the case, and it's weird that you would think that.

Never give goons lances again please

Yep but that had nothing to do with people living in here by 2 mins in the comment had 6 down votes for saying nice pic, thus the 'salty' comment

The problem is in that situation there is a large amount of risk, potentially trillions of isk. If half the fleet disconnects due to a crash because of 64 bit, it can go bad quickly.

How much costed the isotopes used to create this propaganda poster?
---
What died?
---
WHO DIED?
---
It is way to hot.      
---
I lost a day fuck.
---
PL did that, NC. didn't for the one in O-Y
---
I hear it was roughly 15 billion in isotopes to fire all those DDs
---
my cap, my will to live, some russian almost lanced an eagle fleet

at least i got a [medal](https://puu.sh/DEuev/bae0ad71ca.png) for being a GOOD BOYtm
---
What will people call NCDock after all the structures are gone?
---
Tuesday arvo here prime time üòÇ
---
like 15b for the first one lmao
---
imagine being in panfam and leadership refuses to do anything at all, even harass or meme, when something too hard is going on lol  
---
i don't need to imagine that
---
surprisingly only a few subs died. A levi got to half shields and an avatar got slapped a bit apparently but nothing like I honestly expected. I was banking on 5 titans dieing
---
Well not NC will say they won isk war.        
---
They did nothing based on Zkill and you lost 15bil /s
---
quit the game and play some sci-fi ttrpg :D
---
Yeah I know, our morales crushed! We are about to run home in shame
---
How many people wanted to borrow fuel after it?
---
YouTube takes about an hour to finish processing 4K, but I'm tired (4:30am) going to bed.  Give it a little bit if it's still only showing 360p. &lt;3
---
yes
---
Funny. Goons said the same thing when BoB had two Titans. And yet we found a way.
---
Brisc Rubal wants to know your location.
---
Yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah lol that's a big yikes from me.
---
Was better the first time around. Less retardedly broken. 
---
That said, do keep up these posts and stuff. The desire to return to Eve lessens with each example of the game being fucked beyond all repair.
---
Which is why you represent the ones that voted for you and also think about the larger picture. There is no "us" in eve, all players make the game what it is. The CSM is not a "I need another way of winning" platform, it is a soundboard for CCP, but asked and not-asked, on subjects. So a member should be keeping in mind what effects his/her advice can have besides the own selfish desired effects. So above is pretty much the reason why not to vote on Gobbins I guess.
---
NCloak?
---
But guess the panic Poi sabre took a neat photo :3
---
The trick is, in the long run, it‚Äôs better to prioritize the playerbase, even if you‚Äôre only looking at it from the perspective of your alliance. A healthy EVE is good for every alliance, and if EVE dies, then your alliance doesn‚Äôt really matter. People who go ‚Äòbuff my alliance‚Äôs playstyle and nerf everyone else‚Äô are only looking at the immediate future, and are ultimately screwing themselves over by doing so. It‚Äôs far better to take hits to your playstyle if it‚Äôll have a net benefit to the game overall, because that increases the longevity of both the game and your playstyle.
---
I‚Äôve been pretty vocal about my interest in FW, you can check out voteforcornak.com for more info, and it‚Äôs featured very heavily in my interviews with TIS, Jin‚ÄôTaan, and Ron.
---
Living in J-space for a while now I wonder how the combat and gas sites respawn.
---
I have seen posts dating from 2012 saying that they're either completely random, depending on the amount of sites in your system or the activity in your system.
---
Does anyone have a clear answer on it or can I assume its just completely random?
---
Water is wet. And you have my vote, not really high but it's there.
---
See, saying they bot to cash out on RMT while RMTing their titans never made sense to me.
---
They either buy or sell ISK, no one is retarded enough to do both at the same time.
---
Not to belittle either of course!
---
Borrow? Lol we get fuel for free..
---
Imagine being kicked from panfam for being retarded
---
Weren't titans supposed to be a rare sight once upon a time ?   
---
Seems like everyone is flying one nowadays. Fuck it, might as well just give one for free to every player, seems like it's what's going on here anyways.
---
NCnpcdocked?
---
Why the downvotes? Goons don't understand irony apparently.
---
I have never had that kind of problem and I have been around for years. Transferring billions between chars,  is one thing but a few 100mil at the beginning of someone‚Äôs eve life is easily explained.
---
Showed my wife. 
---
"Looks like someone dropped a bunch of nails."
---
I think its pretty anyway.
---
Can someone explain it?
---
sarcasm my bro
---
Absolutely beautiful!
---
 Shame we had so many leemings so only half if not less got to fire a lance.. Would have been much more impressive if we all got to fire
---
https://dscan.info/v/3672c030304a i'll just leave this here.

Oof

Several NS candidate have stated their interest at having attention toward LS for the health of the game, if not various idea at how LS and FW should be fixed.

When ever I try to buy a ‚Äúpack‚Äù from gmg I get an error message telling me that I exceeded the max number that I am able to buy. I have only ever bought one of each and that was months ago?

I was asking who forgot to fill the fuel and din't had enough to jump back after this.
---
hello sandi
---
your not allowed back into tribute when goons leave
---
Can you name post for the next keepstar.       
---
"Keepstar dies in Imperium controlled system", as i assume Ihub there belong to Imperium.
---
Pretty sure that ain't us.
---
We miss you terribly and think of you often. Who are you again?
---
Winning eve = not playing for a while, it is a term you will hear often.
---
Wow, you should report to your nearest Posting Inspector for a reprimande, cause your posting is shite.
---
&gt;And yet we found a way.
---
by getting them neutered
---
Jokes on you, you may think it's "destroyed" but secretly the corrupt shipyard workers are just stripping it down and selling it on the black market for side income.
---
Exactly as irrelevant and inconsequential as you are.
---
Greetings , try to send a support ticket with same email y had the account. If don't work, I will be glad to help you start over
---
I remember a time in Eve when battleships were rare; when Enslaver was the only one in our corp with one (BSE) and when people were annoyed that he lost it.  I think it was an Apocalypse but I could be wrong.  It was back in 2003.
---
Yes?
---
Also lowsec people are often too lazy to prove down a relic farmer because there's other pvp content around the corner
---
COSMOS Missions... *shudder*..
---
Listen to the talk. Example, look at 41:55 and listen 15-20 seconds.
---
For context you can go back a couple min. He actually kinda addresses why it's a good idea to have both goons **and** PANFAM is a good idea

We are currently also working on establishing a Mining Fleet Ops to mine the Conduits while they are down.

I'm going to guess "unsubbed." Synonyms include "winning," "quitting," and "pwned," depending on who you ask.

[Insert clever Bison Tuesday meme here]
---
Wow Brisc you actually logged into the game, I thought you were to busy being an IRL politician.
---
nice job bashing an undefended citadel with \~1000 people! very cool!
---
To quote Spif... EVE is a perfectly balanced game with no exploits.
---
Just like your keepstar count...
---
&gt; spend 100$ , get 2600 plex, inject, get a blingy ship, and die instantly with a juicy killmail because your piloting skills suck.
---
I always wondered about 2 things:
---
1) Why do people limit what "p2w" means to cases when you can buy so much power nothing else matters?
---
2) Why do people assume that a player with bought advantages is disadvantaged at everything else?
---
Is it because it's easier to defend your point that way, huh? I personally have always seen an ability to affect any in-game interaction with out-of-game money as "p2w elements".
---
I'll keep this in mind the next time my toddler requests i draw a phage

---
Is that a lowsec small gang corp?
---
Wrong sub?
---
Is this really an argument you folks are happy to be involved into? Please.
---
even tho I'm repeating a lot of the answers in this thread, i want to give my 2 cents on this matter
---
1. for quick isk u can go into a wormhole c1-c3 in a cheap magnate for example and scan all the sigs down and run only the data and relic sites with factions in their names (Ruined Sancha Temple Site for example), never warp to sites without factions in their names. 
---
2. the best way to do it is like somebody else said, find a wormhole, find a nullsec connection and go explore that. run a couple of sites than deal with depositing cargo (normally u wont be able to dock anywhere but there are areas where u can. if u cannot dock go to a random player owned station, where u will be able to deposit your cargo in the station from space and than u can asset safety that cargo into the nearest station where u can dock which usually will be in lowsec, than u need to pay 10 or 15% of the value of the cargo to get it back from that station but its much better than getting blown up with 500 mil from 10 hours of relic sites loot like i did) 
---
3. lowsec in my experience is full of people who are after pvp 24/7. they enjoy hunting for ships so u must learn how to dscan every few seconds and align out when u about to be scanned down. (Im a lowsec pirate now so i know firsthand that lowsec is not a place for pve in general) 
---
4. as far as i know a cheap magnate for exploring is 5 mil or so, most of the cost will be in the cloak, so dont worry if u lose a few magnates because venturing into nullsec will get u multiple magnates per site
---
i upvoted u friend
---
for sure, this is eve. learn to live with it, not in fear of it
---
Oh, I pinged that with my Ares just before I went to work.  Missed the explosion :(.
---
Hmm, this is the first time a Keepstar was destroyed for the 2nd time in the same system isn't it?
---
yay I did it
---
That is a way
---
keep an eye on local. and your overview. warp out fast if you dont want to fight. or avoid systems with lots of people in it. jin a lowsec group.... i can reccomend 'Panic Attack' lowsec group, who is reasonably newbee friendly. theyll help yastart up. and youll be able to loot more money than you can make in your frig. and just sell the t2 and fancy modules you find
---
'It wasn't before so anyone who says it now is wrong'
---
While carrying 500m in loot in my Astero, I took obvious bait on gate
---
Could anyone of you elaborate why it's not good advices ?  
---
I m mainly a noob who subbed a long time ago and stop and i'm now trying back . I had this exact setupand progression in mind ( from 2014 :p )  .
---
Honestly, this is just a sad sight, but oh well. I'm just a dumb, out-dated person who enjoys subcap PvP.
---
I mean, everything he said seems pretty fucking relevant to me.
---
INIT is still seeding Titans for this operation.
---
Yikes.
---
This one one fat bee... Boat will be extatic when he'll see it :).

Give each of your boys 1m isotopes and ask them to use it all.

Then, ask them to shoot an ab cruiser, tell them whoever fail to hit the target will get kicked from goons.

When NCPL had more titans than others it it was not broken?

"major hub like jita" have a hardcoded anchorable=false that can be used as a check to prevent things like this to happen. (that's the reason you can't anchor a citadel in Jita)

---
Whos keepatar was it?
---
The new low sec FW kings?
---
thank you CCP, for 64 bit client.
---
those titans did not surpass damage cap. the only reason to bring them was to flex. this all happened because elite pvp alliance nc. chose to just leave instead of pvping. goons would not have risked all those caps for nothing if there was a risk. 
---
in fact i think they flexed so hard they killed a fax or too with that stunt lmao.
---
this maybe the reason why the insurance companies can give free ibis
---
Intentions aside, I think we can all appreciate the roast. I love moments like this personal motto; better to say nothing and be assumed an idiot than to speak and prove it.
---
Yes, all of us content creators out there are so fucking happy with 64-bit client.  I've been wanting to make content like this for so long!  Finally have the capability.
---
When you are glassing glas ... what will that become?

I made a Jita trader after I lost a bunch if stuff In null with no idea how to make efficient isk to be able to enjoy eve.

What you running the 5s and 6s in? Just tried a 5/10 Sanshas in a sniper Jackdaw, took forever to get to final room, DPS is just too high with the webs, but I tried. Guessing you are using some sort of Strategic Cruiser?
---
I believe you may be mistaken friend, 
---
 Provi is no ashen moth. No not at all. Provi has been through the ashes of war. It has been wounded and burned. Ripped and torn asunder. There have been betrayals and losses too numerous to count. However, we rebuild. 
---
 We rebuild because that is what we do. We rebuild something greater and more glorious. We rebuild a better Provi. Our Capital ships have boomed. Our supers are booming. Soon we will be even greater than before. That is our way. No matter how many times we are wounded. We rebuild. No matter how much space we lose we always reclaim it. For it is Providence. It is our birthright. 
---
 It is a birthright few can claim kin to. For 15 years our people have fought and built our region to what it is today. It will be there for 15 more years to come. For as long as there is breath in our bodies there is a Providence. We can not be defeated for we have only two stages of war. We have either won the war. Or we are in the process of winning. One day the Providence Marches will be back into our hands. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. There will be a day from R-3 to KBP and all areas in-between will be back under our control. 
---
 No, it is not a moth while the creature in and to itself can be considered beautiful in its own form. You took an entire region of ratters, miners, industrialists, and few PVPers and brought them to war. In the beginning we lacked many things such as skills and doctrines. You are dealing with a fighting force that has known nothing but war, anger, and a dire thirst for vengeance upon our invaders. It took time for our people to get to caps. It takes time for supers. However, there will be a day when your peoples smart remarks will be stuck in your throat. 
---
 You took a peaceful region and turned it into a bunch of steely eyed killers bent on one thing and one thing alone. To the reclamation of our home. We will one day drive you and your ilk from our home. We will drive you from low sec. There will be no place safe for your band of pirates and slaves of PL. 
---
 You  may get your laugh here and there. However, we will rebuild stronger and greater than ever before. Our fleets will burn your citadels, crush your ships, and purge the region of your coalition. Our spies will root you out and from within sabotage and create confusion. Much as like today when an entire fleet was squad warped to our ambush. None survived. Have your fun but know this. You and your friends are on borrowed time.
---
Even if the north had committed everything they had, they would have still lost. There was never a risk to begin with, and there couldn't have been. That was clear since X47
---
Come out to Itrin.. everytime I step out there from Asanot I have to be super paranoid, Dscanning like tweaker looking for crack.
---
Like five lances went straight through our entire fax wing, I don't know how they're not all dead

I joined, just to troll you on reddit as well as comms XD
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeh, Pandemic Legion showing the members its left with seem to be bads, badly defending thier systems, not putting up any fight, i mean, they didnt even have cyno jammers in M-O in the first place. they just rolled over and died. 
---
from what i can tell panfam wasnt going to commit resource to defend something the owner didnt even care about.
---
the first keepstar of many. but please stop everyone thinking this is NC. its PL.
---
I don't think they turn isk to cash. They just bot to make all their titans.
---
Shh, you're spoiling the narrative!
---
Vincent is a cool dude.
---
Each WH is part of a class specific region. When a site id despawned in one region it re-spawns in a system from that region at random.
---
There have already been fights in high tidi and big fleets with a huge number using 64bit... no crashes and it handles the game much better. Very little lag, good FPS etc
---
NClogged
---
Well I go into J-space a lot, so D-scanning constantly without even realizing it is a normal thing. I'm sure some systems are way worse than others, but the large majority I have been to don't have much gate camping. Maybe it's just the times I play, not sure.
---
Shooting a bait proc  in a 200billion alliance tournament ship.
---
The point is, you are not supposed to be thinking in irrelevant parties in the CSM. You are there for the greater good of the game. It doesn't matter from which powerbloc you originate, as long as you have thorough knowledge of the game. An ideal CSM would have equal representatives for each "major" activity within the game, but that will never happen.
---
You can find a [link](https://www.eveonline.com/article/psvt44/csm-14-the-voting-is-now-open?origin=launcher) in the launcher. It is a single transferable vote system, so basically if your first place candidate can't get elected due to math, you vote goes to your second place candidate, and so on. I couldn't enplane the specifics on how exactly that works unfortunately.
---
Cornak Firefist is probably the guy with the best shot at getting on the CSM who has been vocal about fixing FW. He's primarily a null candidate but spent a significant amount of time talking about FW, especially how it's a huge missed opportunity for new player retention.
---
big guns evens the skill cap
---
Very beautiful.
---
NC : We won't defend it so whatever ?
---
I got a custom patch from Mutiny Shop. Seemed fine to me. Several years ago.
---
But there look to be many more places which do them now.
---
Wow! Amazing!
---
Next you're going to tell me how much ISK you made yesterday, while shooting undefended structures and fapping to your FC telling you that you are doing good work.  
---
You're not gonna post good.
---
What the fuck are you talking about, jammers and iHub died days ago.
---
What fight do you want, velators ? You don't undock into 10 times your numbers.
---
times change
---
My artist refined the concepts from my last posting, and here we go with the colorized versions.  As usual, I'll be posting them one at a time.
---
This is Gaurav, one of the best snipers in the known universe, he is also Duluth's BFF.
---
thats funny, how were jammers installed when the ihub didnt have the upgrade?
---
im pretty sure all of tribute (and vale) is controlled by imperium &lt;3
---
The concept of gold ammo comes from World of Tanks. You can buy gold ammo with in-game credits.
---
Not even 2 full fleets,they're not even trying
---
imagine being in goons and needing &gt;1000 people to bash an undefended keepstar, and then still losing 6 dreads to it
---
Try to set Interval one in graphic option, experiment with that. Is should unload cpu/gpu in some cases.
---
Someone brought the wrecking machine...
---
I mean you all have had nearly a year to get on closing that gap.  What did you do with your time?  Drive away gotg, failed at expanding your titan fleets, failed to learn any lessons at all from last summer.
---
Now that you are the underdogs you all want to just sit around and whine about how broken everything is.  I can tell you, after we lost tribute and vale and had to strike out and try to build something new, we fucking built something new.  Still are building caps and supers as fast as we can crank them out.
---
It was already close to broken, but NC/PL were a relatively small group compared to a NS blob, the Imperium is currently the biggest coalition AND the #1 military power (and the #1 economical power not to mention it) so comparison is a bit biased imo. 
---
But i'm curious, as a goon/imperium member, how do you see the future of the game? If NC/PL chose to retreat instead of fighting despite being the second superpower of the game, why would another entity ever fight the imperium again in it's current state and numbers? (not even adding your allies from TAPI)
---
\*failed irl politician
---
Imagine having to keep your players in line via threats rather than playing the game, creating content and having fun
---
Nice picture, it resumes quite well that eve has important problems, having fleets of titans is the result of several broken mechanics, goons have use them at their advantage by pushing further than any other entities.
---
Unfortunately I don't see the game becoming healthier because the only response is to reach the same numbers or even more which doesn't solve the core problems unfortunately
---
im pretty sure you're a retard who can't open dotlan
---
Idk man half the map was ncpl renters back in the day
---
Believe it or not we're not here to down votes everything leave that to the salty ones
---
Not any more.
---
The only thing im voting for is vote of no confidence in csm
---
Even if the entire North, including GotG had gone into full goon mode in terms of industry, it would not have been enough. Not only does it take time to ramp up your production this much, it also takes players. Which the Imperium simply has more of. The north's powerhouses have always been PvP focused. Making the optimal style of play in a game, that is entirely carried by it's pvp, to avoid it entirely is just poor design.
---
I like how no one is mentioning that goons aren't even angry, this is just boredom mitigation.
---
I didn't realize that unions try to force their people to vote for those people and that publically endorsing other people would get them in some serious trouble
---
Final question: How does being in a large nullsec group change any of this? Can you station trade in a large nullsec group? Are there better ways of making money in a large nullsec group? What differences are there?
---
Finally, what preparation would you recommend doing before going Omega? Training up a lot of skills? Getting some capital? I know I can't get 2b in 15 days but I feel like there's no reason to go Omega until is limits my options - what can I do in Alpha?
---
I require ur services lol
---
Could be because they make the game fun for most players, especially newer players.  Instead of worrying more about the green killboard and trying to hang out to the glory days of old?
---
I would say it doesn't matter much for being targeted and primaried in engagements, as decent FCs would prioritise targets by their tactical importance. It can be a factor for EWAR though, as when a fleet has some decent amount of EWAR, able to spread on a good number of ships, FC might call for EWAR to "dampen/jam/disrupt/etc around your name". Which means EWAR pilots may order by name and use EWAR on enemies with names alphabetically close to theirs.
---
Not sure if this is still a widespread usage though.
---
And how long are those new players going to stay exactly when they see that there's no real content anymore, and all they can do is mine or rat?
---
Awesome screenshot!
---
TIL, NC/PL (and presumably by extension N3 before that as well) weren't a nullsec blob.
---
Good Stuff. I'll keep this in mind the next time my toddler requests i draw a penis
---
'The norths'
---
I mean if this one didn't belong to ncpl, then I guess that means we didn't lose one at ualx either.
---
What trump said below - that can help for sure. Lower graphic settings too or reduce the amount of effects selected.
---
try escape from tarkov
---
The alliance isn't a single individual. There are people who bot to sell isk, and obviously other people who buy that isk or run personal bots to fund their Titans.
---
A lot of them seem to enjoy both ratting and mining.  Enough that people Panfam can find repetitive content farming them.  Much the same as the Imperium can find it burning structures and rabble rousing with speeches.
---
So to answer your question.  How longs a piece of string?
---
You're the one who's effortposting lmao
---
my setting is Interval One always but i didnt solve my problem :(
---
i did that thing alr but still have problem. My GPU is 1060 with 32GB Ram and i5  8500
---
Yep
---
TEST is number 2 not NC and PL. They have been nothing but toothless in this conflict.
---
Maybe they should have thought of these issues before they proceeded to drive every ally away, before they sat around for over two years and just ignored the mass titan production going on.
---
None of these things were issues while ncpl had supercap superiority.  Now that they dont they just whhine and bitch endlessly 'the game is broken' 'its poor design'.  The only poor design is the structure of the north.  Once you were unable to farm weaker groups to harvest their super pilots you hit a wall,  and instead of doing something different, you choose to bash your head into the wall and whine about how unfair it is that the wall isn't softer.
---
"Compared to other NS blobs" would be more adequate yep, edited
---
Goons loses some dumb stuff sometimes, but at least it looks like they enjoy themselves doing it. Which is honestly kinda important. It‚Äôs no fun worrying about losses and isk 24/7
---
This multiboxing thing really killed the game for me. :(
---
I hate not being able to be able to reasonably play with just one acc. 
---
This actually is a huge red flag from game design point.
---
Mine is very similar to that and I run 6-7 with minimal problems. You sure you selected interval one on all?
---
That doesn't look fun for anyone involved, actually.
---
NpCdocked?
---
Mining and ratting have the purpose of procuring a resource, that is then used in the economy. No pvp = no economy = no reason to mine or rat. You can't tell me people like the *action* of mining or ratting, because that's quite literally pressing one, maybe two buttons repeatedly for hours. And even if there are people who genuinely enjoy mining or ratting for it's gameplay, are these people enough to keep the game afloat once everybody else goes away?
---
The true enemy is not defeat in Eve but final victory.
---
Look at the Chinese server.
---
No supers in FW space!
---
Yeah.. If one of your active windows fps is more than 60 (or the refresh rate of your screen) than interval one is not set in this window at all. Check all windows.
---
But the strategic/Cap gameplay is poor in itself. On top of that it goes nowhere.
---
I think everyone missed the point. For 10 years NC/PL had a very similar Supercapital Monopoly on the game and any time there were complaints, it was "GG, we earned it!" Now that the shoe is on the other foot it doesnt seem to fit so well...
---
Its funny watching bitches refuse to play and take their ball and go home after they realize they dont get to automatically win every game every time anymore.
---
Sounded to much like "Functional Warfare". They changed it so people wouldn't get the wrong idea.
---
$45?
---
You can fuel the M-O keepstar for a year in 15 minutes starting from Jita for pretty low cost.
---
There is no PvP to have against overwhelming Titan and super advantage.
---
That the way game has been designed and enabled unfortunately.
---
All that industry, dollars and ratting over a year or more results in nothing but 'flexing' the F1 button on a Keepstar.
---
Havnt played in ages. How long does the actual destruction take?
---
Think about them younglings!
---
You don't realise it but you've been seduced into doing something pointless by bad game design.
---
&gt;Much the same as the Imperium can find it burning structures and rabble rousing with speeches.
---
That has a pretty limited interest half-life.
---
How do you know that?
---
Yeah come please. Let's just get this boring war over so we can have some actual fun gameplay.
---
As far as generalizastions go... There are obviously always individuals who get caught in tje crossfire.
---
it only says ncpl owns systems because they are allowed to own them
---
panfam has far more titans per char than imperium, what more can they do?
---
is this a roundabout way of saying "getgud"?
---
yes, they should just blue up everyone like test and only have arranged fights against goons
---
But help with income.          
---
It is short sighted as you replace players with more alt accounts, making game more boring thus more players need to be replaced with alt accounts.
---
Pretty much this.  
---
When you are not doing well in a game you can either look to see what you need to do differently, to do better, or you can continue to play it the same way and complain about how it‚Äôs the games fault you are not able to win.  
---
Both the Goons and Test had the crap beat out of us at different times, but were still able to embrace the current meta and rebuild and construct powerful empires.  While we spent all the time doing this, the other side frittered away their time and mocked us for playing the current meta.   
---
If Eve is broken, it‚Äôs because some people continue to choose to actually not play the current meta while other groups do.
---

---
What and good game design was 'have the preeminent superpower follow weak groups around and farm them to death to harvest their fc and super pilots'?  I'd argue that approach drove far more people out of the game than seeing you smug pricks get farmed and shown that you arent elite.
---
Games 16 years old, its about time we had a winner.
---
I dont give a shit if test comes in second.  I just want to see the north broken, humiliated and destroyed.  Thats my victory state, and this accomplishes that, everything that comes after is an epilogue.
---
We did an Alliance Battle Royale tournament recently, probably one of the most fun evenings in EVE in a long time.
---
Seeing as we did it on Tranq, there were plenty of fun random variables to account for too, including Inner Hell dropping some 30 lokis on our "Supply drops" (a carrier sat at 0 at the sun in a large anchored bubble, dropping shiny mods for people to fit).
---
We had to pause the tournament, reship, fight them off and continue.
---
was it even a hull timer ?
---
What do you think the average person does in Pvp? They anchor up, possibly turn the prop mod on and press F1 when told.  Two or three clicks and at most?  
---
I'm unsure if you're an alt or not but 280 kills in around two and half years is roughly 1 kill every three weeks.  Obviously this falls flat if you're a main but you're banging on about Pvp being the life blood of Eve while barely touching it?
---
People can play they way they want as they obviously do.
---
you dont need to undock to get market pvp'd. logging in is consent to pvp.
---
If adapt means join a blob and farm to get a titan that quite sad for the future of eve :/
---
So many salty people in panfam.
---
he is in TNT, literally worse than renters
---
character sheet, pilot interactions, show losses.
---
click on the killmail to open it and you can see everyone who did damage to you within 15 minutes of you dying.
---
And then?
---
Lol...when I heard ‚Äúequip lance‚Äù I was pretty sure we were going to kill ourself without any help from NL/PL.  
---
Pleasantly surprised!
---
"I can kill him before his friends arrive" no..i couldnt....
---
Good stuff. I'll keep this in mind the next time a toddler has to identify me in a police line up
---
Well my thank you :)
---
What do you do when you get to the last page of a book?
---
my corp's primary recruiting source is killing people, talking to them, then either mining salt or being cool and giving tips depending on if they get mad or can take an L gracefully.
---
Stitch Kaneland and Insidious Sainthood have spent years in the warzone and are currently active there right now.
---
why would they even show teeth when there's absolutely no chance of winning, they did the right thing : evac in lowsec, focus on content and let the imperium blob leave out of boredom when they'll see they spent weeks grinding down structures while the rest of the game had fun.  
---
As for #2, yeah you're right, that's entirely possible
---
Looks boring as shit. Hard pass
---
Can you read?  Goons make up about **half** of fucking null by themselves. Even if we had kept all our allies after WWB, what would have happened? Probably the exact same thing, just with the roles reversed. How fun would EVE be when everyone just peacefully coexists and nobody shoots anyone anymore? The mass exodus from Serenity is telling quite the story about that.
---
&gt;None of these things were issues while ncpl had supercap superiority.
---
Because ncpl never outnumbered their enemy to such a massive extent. Because when ncpl had that superiority, they didn't have it because they bunkered down in a region and just refused to interact with anyone else while building it. Because when ncpl had it, they had actual enemies aside from one or maybe two other fucking blocks.
---
&gt;bitch endlessly 'the game is broken'
---
It is. You can sit there and pretend it isn't while everyone that enjoyed this **PvP centric** game for what it was leaves, but it still is. You can scream at us that we should have adapted, but at the end of the day we both loose the game we like to play, or, in your case, have open in the background while watching Netflix. Soon you'll be able to pet yourself on the back and say "We won", before you realise that this game was never meant to be won. If conflict dies, so does EVE. And you are angry at us that we chose conflict over farming.
---
&gt; while the rest of the game had fun
---
Grinding down structures is fun.
---
Renters don't really count in the same way that actual combat capable members do though. It's no secret that renters have no loyalty to the group, nor any desire to protect it in a war.
---
anthem's endgame was just the same guns with 100% rng.
---
Your suggested independent ballot is a great blend of small time contributors with on exception - 
---
Gobbins personally heads one of the two most dynamic PvP groups in the game and is energetically grrr goons..
---
So you would destroy the game just for a 5 min ego trip? That's sad and stupid.
---
Hard when CCP has no interest in balance passes. Rorq output out of control? Should we give ore anoms scarcity or even longer cooldowns so you can't afk 30k toons in a small area with complete safety? Nah, let's severely nerf the yield for solo rorqs to hurt the smaller groups that have to mine for even longer in already risky space. Should we give them fighter mechanics or significantly stronger rats so you can't afk 45 of them per person? Nah, better make them 100% passive.
---
Should we make incredibly cheap structures that offer no reward when you destroy them in kspace? Sure why not, and instead of using our existing mechanic of requiring moon anchoring spots (which would get people to purge sticks from space as a deprecation path benefit) let's let them put them anywhere so a single system can have a hundred of them. Hell there's a wormhole where one bored person has anchored nearly a hundred raitarus.
---
Instead of rewarding players for utilizing under used space everything they do seems to benefit n+1000 within jump range of a keepstar. Whoever has the most warm bodies will have a cascading economy with none of the natural scarcity or logistical issues that slow runaway development in real systems.
---
Nah, better for you all to sit around and circle jerk about how unfair it all is while wasting years doing nothing to better your situation.
---
I think its funny to watch you 'elites' cry.
---
We'll fuck it up eventually. It is our destiny.
---
So what, if the north cant compete they should get some welfare titans to even the balance sheet?
---
If you cant compete you lose, if you cant find a way to even the gap its not on your enemy to do that for you too.
---
Its treason then ...
---
Hey send me money too I undock
---
I don't know if you'll have the same opinion in a month, especially if NC/pl/horde doesn't show up at all
---
You aren't seeing the wood for the trees. You have swallowed so much propaganda about 'victory' you haven't thought about what it actually means.
---
Lol!
---
I've been careful about predicting the future of the games since WWB happened.
---
I dont get that logic. Ask Brave, Provi or any number of weaker alliances they farmed for content over the years if they were a blob.
---
I literally quit the game because I didn't get past mining and missioning. I've only been active again for maybe around a year.  The vast majority of those 280 kills come from that timespan.
---
&gt;People can play they way they want as they obviously do.
---
Sure, but the way they want to play seems to be actively detrimental to the games health. If everybody wants to farm, who am I to stop them? It isn't really about the 'right now' anymore. It's about wether or not the game will even still exist two or three years down the line.
---
Ah sorry. That was more of a orange than a red, and the pink we asked you for, you selected a salmon like come on do you wve know colors?
---
idk my experience with your linemembers is mostly them bitching that they can't play the game and have to shoot abandoned structures all month
---
So up until now EVE has only been using 4 of my 16gig? ü§£
---
Thank you for breaking it down for me sir.
---
no idea what you are talking about.  Just because some random idiot on the internet says it (you) doesn't make it true.
---
Setting aside your implication that we were in any way involved in the decision to make it so that Titans couldn't wipe out entire fleets without risking anything more than a cyno alt: If the game requires that Titans be nerfed, they'll be nerfed. On that day, we'll do what we've always done: adapt and overcome. Those who don't will be come vic-oh fuck, we ***are*** BoB now, aren't we?
---
It's why smart people enjoy these sales.
---
We horde plex, buy it cheaper, and then when the sale is over the price goes up.
---
PLEX has historically always recovered, with more value eventually. 
---
https://evemarketer.com/types/44992/history
---
its been this way for the past 2ish years 
---
only sign for change so far has been hilmar running his mouth at eve meets which bears very little weight sadly.
---
Long fucking way from the MBC isn't it?
---
(Also, by the way, test told you that the job wasn't finished after wwb and what did you all do?  Did you do the hard work of completing the job?  No, you went the lazy route of trying to farm us.)
---
You used to have the biggest super fleet and the largest coalition.
---
Who drove that coalition away piece by piece?
---
Now that you dont you all just bitch and whine.  
---
You failed to adapt to the meta, you failed to plan for a future further out than 8 weeks from now, you failed to match your enemy and now you are surprised you cannot compete.
---
Kinda fucking hard to have a PVP game when one side is lazy and fails to keep themselves in a position to be competitive.
---
If everybody is a moron but you, you may be missing something critical.
---
How do you know they have no chance to win ?
---
Seems to me that those fleets are a direct response to the when we were kicked out of the north.  We were outnumbered in supers and titans then, the decision was made to correct that and here you see the result.
---
It's not like anyone has an obligation to show up, though.
---
Not bad for the middle of the night.
---
Yeah, you're right dude. This game sucks. You should quit.
---
(canihaveyourstuffthough)
---
And NCPL wonder why most of their members who were good players are gone...
---
Found the bot
---
&gt;your blingfit cruiser can still get owned by an AF fit to counter you
---
&gt;you blingfit enough and youll turn into well known target and gangs will hunt you every time you undock. 
---
example: we formed a fleet just to [kill this one guy](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77194722/) because he is a well known blingfitter. someone who knew his name saw him in local, notified whoever, and a fleet was out in like 4 minutes hunting him.
---
So yea, what the fuck do you want?  Free titans?  Or maybe ccp should ban half of goons so that you can be competitive?  
---
Victory means the north is destroyed and cannot be competitive.  That the smug elitist pricks up there are driven from the game.
---
At that point victory for me means that my goal of seeing the north destroyed is accomplished, as I've said, everything after that is an epilogue.  At that point I lay the game down as it is completed.
---
That was a fairly good combat video. Great music selection.
---
Dual MASB rocket hawk is just amazing man, do that first if you haven't done it yet. Especially if you have AF V
---
No one is saying NCPL is elite either, apart from TAPI Dinoposters who have been fed that shit by people who got rolled over in the past for being straight awful. I wonder if people will ever realise that being slightly less terrible than someone else at a certain point in time is not being elite.
---
She even had you set them +5
---
&gt;1) Why do people limit what "p2w" means to cases when you can buy so much power nothing else matters?
---
putting purple on you ship doesnt give give you invincibility or triple damage. youll win against one guy who isnt fit to counter you. you wont win against a gang or a hard counter. 
---
&gt;2) Why do people assume that a player with bought advantages is disadvantaged at everything else?
---
circumstantial i know, but ive never seen someone blingfit who isnt bad other than well known youtube PVPers who i think all of them have built enough of an economy force for themselves that they can afford their ships without selling plex.
---
Its almost as if we are asked to forget that the wrecking ball was a literal blob of supers.
---
And then TAPI cry about Goons being elitist bullies who are farming them to death, duh.
---
Nope it shows that the game play is so vast and diverse in eve that you cannot reasonably expect to have a single character that can do everything.  
---
You can have better tools by specialising. Even with one account you have three characters. The step after using the other two characters is to have a second account.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bz3hy1/callout_matterall/
---
you can have just as much fun with one account as you can with 20.
---
Noone, there are some LS candidates, but even the current GSM insisted CCP on the need to do something about LS and CCP basically said "fuck that".
---
So there you go, we are alone and forgotten in this wasteland we call home.
---
I had a noobie join in and clean up after my Hel a few months ago. I gave him a Thorax with cargo expanders/rigs and salvagers fitted with like 10 MTUs inside of it. 3 hours and my sanity later, I was done super ratting and he raked in like 400mil isk. 
---
Delve scraps are also good scraps.  Plus, theres no "logistics" to figure out really, if you really want to sell it in Jita you can just ship it up there.
---
Joined PH about 2 weeks ago after coming back to the game, trying to learn PvP fleet/solo. Holy bad idea Batman.

Oh please, stop lying.

Not even √† Word for the poor little bombers that teizd to bomb the 2.5km/s fleets... Riiip
---
Sounds great in theory until you realise people just have 10x ratting/mining alts that do the same role
---
Yeah that guy single-handedly nerfed jump ranges, introduced fatigue, skill injectors and reworked rorquals for the sole purpose of screwing over Pandemic Legion and then stuck around to watch. Fuck that guy forever.
---
In a month there won't be anything left to shoot.
---
Oh no playing internet spaceships with other people what a shame.
---
&gt; Dude, I don't know what to tell you. You're acting like it's impossible for somebody to make a mistake and then correct it. 
---
I actually was saying that there's some issues I have with the supposedly factual retelling of events. I never said CCP was infallible. Or you.
---
&gt; And no, there was never any me "saying stuff out of anger."
---
Ok dude. You definitely don't have a penchant for getting angry and saying shit on reddit.
---
&gt; There are no plot holes. The whole story has been put out in various media. Guy sells a Molok, another guy buys it. Thinks he got ripped off because of changes (FAX nerf, HAW changes), complains about it to CSM member, CSM member goes to CCP, conclusions are jumped to. It's pretty straightforward. Did it make any sense? No. Was it wrong? Yes. That's why CCP corrected it.
---
As I said in my last post, I'm literally never gonna talk about it again. You win. You've literally beaten me into submission. Congrats. Hope you're happy. Hope it makes your day. You're also a serene fucking Buddha of kindness and generosity.
---
A good way to mess with them would be to populate the player list in memory with fake players entering/leaving system that don't actually display on the client. The bot devs would figure out how to filter these out pretty quickly though.
---
And it would even make some sense lore wise... the implications for nullsec would also be interesting if you consider that would imply no more Titan bridges in LS either, moving big fleets around would be way more tactical.
---
maybe cause he is in a position on base of Director or CEO or Leadership of one of the alliances?
---
BRING ON
---
THE WRECKING MACHINE
---
Errr Hard Knocks system too?
---
Counter question is it our fault they cant stay friends with their allies? Their coalition should rival us in size but doesnt cause they constantly reset allies instead of build them up... just saying.
---
And CCP still doesn't givea single fuck.
---
Well, we haven't been able to figure that out in the real world.
---
For me it's the other way round. Imperium does not seem to understand that they are too big for any entity in Eve to fight them. There is simply no meaningful content for such a large coalition. Unless you consider bashing undefended structures for 6 hours straight is content
---
"Do you think we've packed enough titans for this trip?"
---
"Yeah, let's grab another ten to be sure."
---
I love how you can see a Boson on the left side of the blob =))
---
Yes i did for all accounts
---
Checked and still have problem. All accounts have interval one setting
---
100m a vote? Yeah, that might do it.  Except the ballots are anonymous, so you couldn't verify that you're getting what you paid for.
---
"with other people"
---
i feel like you might be downplaying it a bit, there's some countries in the world with a military smaller than what was on grid
---
Don't skip the tutorials, they are very important. Suffer through it now so you don't sit there not knowing whats going on later.
---
&gt;At that point victory for me means that my goal of seeing the north destroyed is accomplished, as I've said, everything after that is an epilogue. At that point I lay the game down as it is completed.
---
I don't think you are being honest. Either that or you sound obsessed. Plus it isn't all about you and an obsession with smashing Panfam, even if it means destroying the game.
---
Hmm, didn't those changes were introduced by ex NCPL members?
---
he thinks that it would be acceptable for CCP to sell "gold ammo" only using real money. gold ammo being an item that makes you better than everyone else and is only available by a real money purchase. its unlike faction ammo because that is bought with LP (via BPCs) and has to be built first before it can be used/sold.
---
Goons don't farm. They are a giant industrial complex geared to producing Titans and taking Sov from people using overwhelming force. It was the most short-sighted strategy for Mitanni to take cos it unfolds in the death of the game ultimately.
---
Really disappointing Cornak isn't on that ballot.  He's run a great campaign and seems like a great candidate... that just doesn't have the institutional backing everyone else has.
---
X-47 keepstar is already a good hint of how a direct clash between the two coalitions would turn. We are now one year later, Gotg has become imperium allies, CO2 is dead and even the allmighty french connexion (who held goon all by themselves in PB remember!) works with goonies, I ask you : do you think they can actually win now more than last year?
---
I didn't see that video. I know that Stainguy has been memeing about buying them, but that isn't me.
---
No it shouldn't. No group should ever be that big. And everyone in the North keeps trying to avoid it because it's incredibly boring.
---
If I was a krab I wouldnt join the smaller of two groups in the current meta, because they couldnt protect me as well. For NCPL to follow in your footsteps they would need to convince all the krabs of eve that they can protect them better than goons.
---
Panfam have the game knowledge to understand how this conflict will go? How did goons not know this would be the endgame?
---
The Levi only got to 50% shield!
---
AAR: Sometime early Saturday Hammerwerke asked for assistance holding their wormhole against Hole Control painting themselves as a small group besieged by a large invading force, initially they gave us a time in German time zone which was corrected early Sunday morning a few hours before the fight took place. 
---
Expecting Munnins and Leshaks we had originally intended to brawl them under the guns of the Munnins but after seeing the force distributions of both sides decided to take a different route leading to the eviction of the defenders. Despite knowing what we were up to they were caught in a drag bubble after attempting to abandon their Fortizar, we warped over and decided to fight the Bhaalgorn blob expecting to feed pretty hard but it went quite well as they seemed disorganised.
---
 Good fight, pretty fun and it's refreshing to question a bat phone instead of run down a smaller force.
---
haha look at those retard pvp corps actually wanting to do pvp and not krab all day haha
---
If someone does that on a large enough scale, CCP will probably notice and hide more information.
---
Lance, Boson, Reaper... who knows the difference anyway, right?!
---
I think it's better for everyone to represent their own playstyle (in a healthy way ofc), since a mega alliance like Goonswarm who care much more heavily about mining and industry focused gameplay will not be able to understand the PVP chasing playstyle half as well as someone who focuses almost entirely on that, and vice-versa. 
---
It'd be just as stupid to expect someone in Goons to represent groups that have been completely brickwalled by off-timezone structures, or to represent groups that rarely can form enough to break a single fax. It'd also be stupid to get input on how a change might effect the supercapital umbrella problem when they don't operate a supercap umbrella.
---
i'm missing your peasant brain.
---
Have you tried the 64 bit client yet? 
---
I have 1060 3GB GPU with 16GB ram and i5-4670k and I've been running multiple clients on high settings and it runs smooth as warm butter. If your interval one setting is messed up, maybe reinstall the client or reset the shared cache and all that stuff.
---
The discord link doesn't work
---
Dont forget to add smite damage
---
Maybe that will become a reality when Matterall gets on the CSM :)
---
If you aren‚Äôt a fan of GSF candidates you will love my next post
---
Mayber you can. I, knowing the possibilities and meta, can not. :(
---
WHY ARE YOU DOWNVOTING HIM, HE'S RIGHT
---
EVE Uni is some of the best information you'll find getting started.
---
Damn Rax, getting downvoted based on flair alone. I feel for ya
---
Its funny how most people here didn't listen 2 minutes after that where he said: "I would need to hear arguments for and against and my advice would come in the form of does this help people get attracted to the game and does it hurt the existing player base"
---
Whatever mate, i'm not talking about the reasons that led to this, you may be right at some point but you still don't answer my question :  as a goon/imperium member, how do you see the future of the game? Why would anybody fight you again instead of retreating like panfam does?
---
Wrong. On so many levels i will not even list them. 
---
&gt; but your goals have to be smaller.
---
Have to? I did not know my goals HAVE TO be some and some. Thanks for letting me know i can not longer even set my own goals. SMH
---
I actually have good hopes that we will see a solid revamp of FW the way we saw it for HS. CCP has been slowly leaking internal interest at reworking FW and many CSM members think it's in dire need of fixing too so hey, who knows.
---
says the solo player
---
There are some devs who were once players and yes some of them used to be PL members. What's that have to do with Hedliner though?
---
How do you know it wasn't stolen?
---
Like who?
---
In that manner, every MMO is broken since some people always are escalating in a way you are not able to compete with, wether it's some gear or in this case spaceships.
---
The future of the game is fine. If you want someone to blame, look at NC/PL. They A: started this conflict by evicting goons. B: didn't follow through by finishing them. C: didn't even defend their own sov
---
So has CCP just stopped giving a fuck?  Why are they bothering with new content at all?
---
I just unsubbed my main for the first time since 2009.  Doubt I'll be back at this point.
---
I did them and career agents, still no clue Wat happens
---
There's very little to fight over strategically anyway since resources and space are so plentiful in the game.
---
I've been asking Goon players similar questions but you don't tend to get an answer.
---
Beyond the willy-waving of an overwhelming Titan and super fleet how will the game unfold?
---
The Chinese server is the ultimate destination surely?
---
look at all these titan mains
---
WOW. Blatantly stealing other people's video intros much???
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a-_a6aNmlE
---
Because they are full of 1 or 2 year-old players who injected into Titans and believe their own propaganda.
---
&gt;completing the job
---
We don't want our opponents to quit. We want fights. Curbstomping some that's already unconcious is not a fight.
---
&gt;Who drove that coalition away piece by piece?
---
We did. Because having it was boring. Because it gave us too many blues.
---
&gt;You failed to adapt to the meta
---
The meta is avoiding pvp. Sorry we didn't do that.
---
&gt; failed to match your enemy and now you are surprised you cannot compete.
---
And you matched them by sucking their dicks. If "matching your enemy" is literally farming for more than a year and nothing else, sorry we didn't do that.
---
&gt;when one side is lazy
---
Are we lazy for not farming our asses off? Are we lazy for creating content instead of trying our hardest to choke out any semblance of it? If you say so.
---
&gt;fails to keep themselves in a position to be competitive.
---
Gold medal for mental gymnastics. "You are at fault for this **pvp** game dying, because you did **pvp** while we farmed." If farming until your eyes bleed is the only way to stay competetive, sorry we didn't do it. Have fun with your empty game, tho. I'm sure telling yourself how we are to blame will keep it alive.
---
It's really not.
---
Elimination is: 
---
They get excluded for some reason (this is really rare)
---
They get elected (a portion of your vote will trickle down to your next choice)
---
They get eliminated because they had the lowest number of votes in a round, and were below the required quota. (Most likely)
---
This means you can vote for your preferred candidate first, even if you don't think they stand much of a shot of getting elected, without wasting your vote. Because if you were right, and they didn't get enough, your vote moves to someone else. 
---
This helps with, say, wormholers. Say they have 5 candidates. Now, you might not like candidate 5 much, but you'd prefer them to being elected to having no-one. you can put them in position 5. If wormholers all do this, and have enough people voting to hit quota (11th of the vote +1 ) *one* of them will get elected. Regardless of the order. (if they have enough to hit quota twice, 2 would get elected) Rather than them splitting the vote five ways and getting no-one elected.
---
Haha, look at this dumb ass that cant compete in pvp anymore, look at him fail at the only thing he wants to do.
---
2 accounts used to be a bonus, now it's a requirement for a lot of groups
---
Pretty sure no one begrudges goon line members their hard krabbed titans or their desire to use them. If anything I'd say anyone who got to use a titan before they became little more than a glorified battleship feels bad for them missing the chance to flail around with them shooting things that weren't undefended keepstars.
---
I love how he is still in NC. Like the ultimate middle finger to pamfam.
---
probably the best eve video i've seen in 2 years+ you put in rl grime and awesome metal, it was the first eve video that i found the music content relatable and the combat was savage and no tidi or null cancer, super awesome big ups. subbed.
---
Have we ever had a 50% discount for PLEX packs?! O.o
---
&gt;Like 'pride month' ... why to include this in EVE ...
---
Because Eve isnt all about you, and there are LGBT+ players who play this game also.
---
You stole an entire intro??!
---
So what you are saying is, "nerf everything" so it does not make sense to build up big alliances, while the whole game is about building communities?

at slot 8, it makes not a blind bit of difference.
---
Their ballot, if the last couple of years are anything to go by, will be exhausted by position 3
---
Not now, no,  they missed their window because they were stubbornly refusing to see the new meta.  Rather, they thought they would follow brave down to catch and farm them for talent and supers,  they spent the better part of a year failing at doing that.  Meanwhile their enemies were furiously outbuilding their super fleet.  
---
Now that they are reduced to a position of abject inferiority what is their path?
---
I assume they hit the damage cap.
---
If only those changes affected the rest of the players and not PL. CCPLZ
---
That looks like a stock project you can download and make small changes to. There's loads of them all over the place.
---
shoutout to my main man bob kaiserstien, praise be upon him
---
Does he even know about the Jita riots?
---
&gt;Gold medal for mental gymnastics. "You are at fault for this pvp game dying, because you did pvp while we farmed."

Said the guy who is no longer competitive in pvp.
---
I don't know where you're getting this shit. What penchant do I have for getting angry and saying shit on reddit? I am almost never serious on reddit. That shit doesn't play here. 
---
I'll be a serene fucking Buddha of kindness when I don't have idiots claiming months later that I still did something wrong.
---
If only there was a lowsec gate to Stain everything would be easier...
---
There hasn't been a keepstar kill like this in almost a year. Relax, dude.
---
You would need a titan anyway. No poors allowed.
---
Shoot TAPI or FRT of course.
---
There is zero chance you weren't going to try to get a massive super blob anyways.
---
Verified.
---
Amazing counter-argument. Really showed me. How could I have known that my argument is invalidated by the fact that it's correct? I am such a fool
---
2? It has been like that since I started playing, and that was way longer than 2 years ago.
---
Because different entities handle competition in different ways.
---
was the difference that big? (I wasn't playing at that time) you succeed well but there will not be a response from your ennemies to that because it would require quite a lot of people and time and the population of eve isn't growing sadly.
---
Why are state of goonions 15 minutes, and state of gobions 2 hours?
---
People honestly don't care.
---
There are thousand different players playing EVE.
---
You can't balance different playstyles to be equal, but there's always an option to push for clear rock-paper-scissors balance between different playstyles on very general level. If every playstyle has clear hardcounter that can be applied, any group going all-in towards certain playstyle needs to either find a way to play around it (with all the related drawbacks) or diversify enough to have decent coverage in every area (and still be vulnerable to a dedicated well aimed hit).
---
2? When i sit to my PC i run 4 and most of the time do stuff on all of them.     
---
I am bad at multiboxing, but usually those are the task that you can do in backgroud.      
---
Like move 4bilion of tritanium between structures, or light a cyno.

And? What is your point here exactly?

Yeah, how many people though. A sizeable number? That's just a drop in the ocean, the head of the bell curve of idiots.
---
Lmao, no

The way all those pay-2-win games work. Will kill EVE Online very fast.
---
He should apply at PA or WG.
---
So let me get this straight, people are upset here because there is a fleet of titans attacking a keep star? I mean to be honest the game isnt broken, this isnt the fault of CCP or some lack of nerf or some buff. It has nothing to do with the anom spawn rate or the flleta of rorqs. Eve is a sandbox game, the sand was placed there by CCP to do stuff with and goons as well as TAPI and many other alliances work with what sand they have and take what they dont. A titan is the most powerful ship in the game, its natural for some if not most people to want one, so how exactly can you be mad at goons for providing for there alliance members? Because it doesn't support your vision of the game? Because it kills subcap gameplay? Because you belive that its killing eve and making it capitals online? No one has anyone to blame but there selves, delve has been a meme for YEARS we all knew what they were doing down there and instead of people banding together and doing something we let it happen. If it was that big a risk to the game and we really felt that way, why haven't us (the players) used the sand that CCP gave us and eliminated this player created threat? They pay to play this game the way they want same as us, so I cannot fathom that you all constantly berate these players for doing what you allow them to do then turn around and bitch at CCP for allowing them to do what we all had an equal opportunity to do they weren't gifted that space by CCP, so it's not there job to make it easier for us (non goons) to deal with them. If its bothers everyone oh so much, rally your corp, rally your friends, rally the whole damn alliance and hit them. If head on dosen't work, use guerilla tactics, hit their rorqs, burn there renters, bomb their ratters. All of these tactics are something that you can do, generating content instead of shitposting because they are bigger than you. You want something done right do it yourself, you want goons power nerfed? Do something about it!

Die a hero, or live long enough to become the villain.

Sorry, I didn't read your drivel.
---
It's a blueprint original meaning he can make as many as he wants with it
---
They typically will take anywhere from 5-30 years of nonstop production to pay off their buy value, this one will be closer to 30 years. 
---
The idea is you pay this massively inflated price for this, make a little isk producing it until you need to sell the blueprint again for a hopefully a bigger price or at least the same price you bought it at. 
---
its a collector item mostly
---
Nullsec candidates aren't in any decent position to represent FW gameplay since the majority of them haven't spent any time in FW in years. Their experience in 100 man fleets, industry and citadel mechanics doesn't translate to FW mechanics.
---
The are a handful of FW focused candidates, but aside from Stitch Kaneland, who isn't a dedicated FW player either, they're pretty much nonames with no recognition outside of their niche community.
---
^^^^ I'm not a tech wizard sadly, I'm working on it, baby steps :P
---
Of course you didn't. You just want to be angry at everyone but yourself for the slow descent of this game. You didn't even have to say it, reading your answers tells us as much.
---
lets not act like youre anymore known
---
&gt; I don't know where you're getting this shit. What penchant do I have for getting angry and saying shit on reddit? 
---
Hm.
---
&gt; I'll be a serene fucking Buddha of kindness when I don't have idiots claiming months later that I still did something wrong.
---
Lol. Take a minute and be introspective for a bit instead of getting angry at people and calling them idiots. And I‚Äôm not claiming you did anything wrong any more, at least not about this. What part of me saying that was unclear? Was it the ‚Äúyou win‚Äù or the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop‚Äù?
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
"Building communities" doesn't mean "shoehorn everyone into the biggest blobs," and every effort to try and get players to play the game in this manner has damaged player interest and retention. Communities are small groups of five or so friends and their other close friends, not 5,000 random nerds under the same banner.
---
Yeah and we all laugh when people fly a nyx day 2 and list it because experience &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money

Learning to rat, could not fly anything bigger than a bomber. Killed battleships in Sanctums with no problems.

&gt; our CEO plays both
---
I need more info, how does anyone extend day by this much?
---
Well yeah maybe I dont' have enough knowledge about other MMO, maybe it's a bad feature that they all share
---
&gt;but NC/PL were a relatively small group compared to other NS blobs
---
N3 contained more players than any other coalition, WTF are you smoking?
---
It's not that they didn't know, it's that they don't know how to stop it.
---
As a non-Goon I'm not interested in 'ultimate victory' because it doesn't exist in the game; when one side wins everything then they lose everything since the game becomes dead - look at the Chinese server.
---
Yes CCP enabled Goons' anti-gameplay with injectors, rorquals, poor enforcement of anti-botting, and poorly thought out resource and sov mechanics, but ultimately Goons themselves made the decision to go down the game destroying route.
---
Well is it shoking that you found a Hel?   
---
or is the Real shoking part:   
---
It is trash Evictus. Offcourse this is happening there and you are not surprised that they suck :D
---
Can't watch the vid at work but what was the reason you decided to help the attackers in the end?
---
How many defenders were there? How many attackers?
---
Doesmt look like much of a fight just going by zkill but will watch the vid later
---
NC/PL never set out to destroy the game.
---
To be known in the Swarm is to be known everywhere that matters.
---
Eve is pay to loose ;) 
---
One things is sure in Eve : if you buy stuff and use it, it will finished in explosion, soon or late you will loose it.
---
By your logic no MMO can be broken?
---
I love watching his stream/youtube uploads. But during one of them, he talked about lowsec gets CCP attention and how the release of Citadels is "CCP love for lowsec"....I wished to get in the screen and punish him.
---
Protect wormtongue at all costs
---
CCP had a bright idea to merge the dscan window with the map window.
---
So first thing you should to is unanchor your dscan window from the map, top left or top right of the window.
---
Then you have 2 bars in the dscan window where you can set you range of dscan (up to 14.3 AU) and angle of scan (5-360¬∞)
---
You left out the bit where you tell us whether you got him or not ) Bastard!
---
Those are decent advices. Its just some specific playstyle and not everyone like it. But there are some points in doing missions.
---
For someone who doesn't play the game, I seem to play it a lot.
---
Most mmos deal with that by raising the level cap and resetting the playing field.
---
But that would kill eve, to reset everything to day 1, rather than rejuvenate it.
---
No buddy. Its not the dumbest thing ever. Its Evictus :)   
---
dumbest thing ever = Evictus. So the correct gramer of your sentence is.   
---
That's Evictus. :)
---
tbh i spend very little time in LS. i assumed upwell stations were good for LS because you didnt have to share a station with neuts (station games are why i hate LS). why am i wrong?
---
Maybe that was the plan, but players cleared them in 1 day, so who knows.
---
Anybody running with even a slight chance of winning is going to be putting a FW at the top of their list of things to do.

That's my john :)

preach
---
Grr goons ... however, I think you‚Äôre right.
---
Yea, no,  you keep bitching about how you want pvp and you only want to pvp, and yet you as an organization are no longer able to be competitive in pvp, and thats somehow not your fault cause you only want to pvp. 
---
Like I said, drivel.
---
No. It will be the player that play better than the other. A loki* paid by plex or no is still the same loki*.
---
* replace by the ship you want i dont care.
---
Wait. Seriously? We always have at least one lemming...
---
The Trigs made a Stabber?
---
Use your directional scanner to figure out if there are people approaching?
---
Yeah Evan is a good example to say that eve online is pay to loose.
---
Its not like we have alarm clock tryhard... 0_O oh gawd
---
\*vanishes\* Yay CCP...
---
How do all those doomsdays work with the Fozzie damage caps?
---
True, but is there any competition left to handle ? From an outside perspective, it seems there's actually nothing to hope except a disband or a coup "a la the judge". I'm curious about how you see this from an inside perspective
---
An external agent has no business even being allowed to run for the CSM, while directly acting in competition with CCP.
---
I'm not sure who he's working with but after watching Riot sabotage Heroes of the Storm and Battelrite to death I get some ideas.
---
Hasn‚Äôt everyone got one?
---
Wasn't the whole point of the damage cap to make it so that you didn't need caps to destroy upwell structures?
---
And who are you?
---
95% of the year we only deploy small sigs and provide/get a lot of content. It's not like we go in and deep dick every single entity in the game. 
---
Besides how can you feel bad for ncpl? They were the boogeyman for so many years and would literally extort anyone smaller for good moons/cheap titans.
---
D:  sat by and watched there enemy grow, with out attempting to keep up or cull there growth.
---
The last time, it required multiple groups putting aside their differences to focus on the main threat. That can still happen. And there's nothing that the Imperium has done that can't be replicated by our opponents. Legacy is actively following that path and reaping the rewards of it. 
---
It's a wheel and it keeps turning.
---
&gt;Goons themselves made the decision to go down the game destroying route.
---
I'm not sure what choice we had after getting evicted from the North other than "build up so this doesn't happen again".  GSF exists as an empire building entity.  We'd pretty much die with an extended homeless period.
---
flat circle something something
---
so declare yourself ruler of your daughters nipples?
---
The same dude who tells me that I can't know what was in his head is now telling me what's in my head. Ok.
---
As I said before, and it bears repeating, I'm out of patience with people who are still claiming I did something wrong, when they've got no evidence, and everybody involved has confirmed that I did nothing wrong. 
---
The part I don't get is why you're still posting if you've given up and won't talk about it anymore.
---
Ok so you are actually retarded, yes? **BEING COMPETITIVE IN THE CURRENT META IS AVOIDING PVP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.** We want to **FIGHT** not **FARM**. Saying that we should have **FARMED** because now we can't compete in **FIGHTING** is exactly proving my point that the current meta in this **PVP GAME** is broken. **IN A PVP FOCUSED, PERSISTENT UNIVERSE, IT SHOULD NOT BE OPTIMAL TO IGNORE BOTH OF THESE THINGS.** But you already admitted that you are not in any way interested in the games health, but instead only want to see us fall. Lucky for us, you will be left incredibly unsatisfied because the north will not be smashed and humiliated. The majority of our assets will probably end unsubbed in a low sec station. There won't be a big pompous battle where the o-so-proud north gets obliterated. There will be a sharp drop in sub numbers and that's it.
---
It sounds like you got a mental illness. You might want to see a psychiatrist
---
Tengu or Loki would be your best bets, especially if you wish to travel with covops.
---
damage cap still applies. fighters were used to grind it down then the supers were cynoed in.
---
The fate of all heroes
---
Good stuff, Ill keep this in mind the next time my daughter shows me a new BTS song.
---
hahahaha haha hahahaha hahahahaha hahahahahahahaha
---
Delve was secure long ago.
---
IMO it is bad, and from different points of view(Just few things from the top of my head):
---
-FW view: taking control of a system is now meaningless, as the enemy Faction can still dock in their structures.
---
-The industry view: bonus over hs/null that was enjoyed in lowsec was almost removed. The thukker during the Towers-era gave 15% bonus to cap production and costed less than 100m, now you need a stupid expensive azbel and an expensive thukker-rig that give barely half that bonus.
---
- Income: no more passive income from moons
---
- Generally anything a Fortizar can do, can be done in a station, and unlike null/wh, lowsec systems mostly are full of stations. Keepstar?? yea...unless you are a big null entity or their pet, good luck owning one. 
---
- And then there is all the issues with Citadels that is shared along hs/null, such as the timers mechanics etc.
---
 64 bit client for the win.
---
FW have been debated for *years*. Ideas and suggestions with general agreement are known from everyone. Some NS candidates like Cornak have shown they have understanding of the issues and the suggestion to fix them.
---
Assuming no pure FW player is elected, why wouldn't they be able to gather the feedback and provide it to CCP ? HS had been in the exact same situation, there wasn't a real HS candidate yet they gathered feedback, organised town halls, and CCP brought us 2 iterations.
---
Now you can be pessimistic as fuck all you want I don't care, but ignore those facts.
---
but that...that makes Gobbins...case...for him:?  
---
youre making no sense my dude. none.
---
i didnt realize how common capitals were until someone was surprised that i couldnt get my half bil station locked apoc navy out because i dont have a carrier to put in it and just cyno out. 
---
honestly id rather just gate it though enemy territory with a small gang in tow to see if i can get some content anyway.
---
People supporting pride month doesn't hurt you one bit. Who cares?
---
So many z‚Äôs
---
Stop crying. Seriously, the crying about Goons having a bunch of Titans is ridiculous. Is it healthy for the game and a whole? Of course not but what is CCP going to do, ban goons? Work in turning any number of the large corps in goons. Or form together and take on goons. This is a game with goals that's been around going on 2 decades. The endgame stuff is going to be the norm at some point. Goons just did it better.
---
you know why...dont play goon with us.
---
&gt;Goon begging
---
If by "my stuff" you mean cancer, then yes I hope you do have it.
---
No
---
You vote yourself. A twitch prime account costs 30 cents wholesale
---
The same. They gonna go in low sec and get grumpy over there for a time.
---
COME BACK !!!
---
I‚Äôm sure you mean when they were difficult to acquire
---
Best thing to do is just never be anywhere near this kind of weaponised autism to begin with.
---
The rest of eve just moves on regardless.
---
So...maybe if NCPL communities werent toxic as fuck theyd have more friends.
---
I mean, plenty of people thought that about Deklein, until it wasn't.
---
That would be the next question: Who defines the size of communities? OR Should it be capped in a sandbox game like this in the first place?
---
If CCP had iterated on it and not left FW as the raging garbage fire its been for ~4 years, i'd still be there. But seeing it at peak glory to where it was about 8 months ago when i left, i had no choice to leave as it was no longer a fun place for me to spend my time in. Which is why i moved to wormholes. 
---
FW is still important to me, even if im no longer in the warzone. Its an area of space that helps newbros get their pvp feet wet, instead of being churned up by the nullbloc machine and then being left with burnout and nowhere else to fall back on.
---
Trump Dots, awesome!
---
But Brisc, being a member of the Imperium super coalition that contains half the players in 0.0, how do you see the future of the game?
---
1. equip your toon with a triglavian survival suit (the expensive one, very important).
---
2. Do roams in nullsec with your friends.
---
3. Upload videos of it on youtube, but take care to only show videos where you win solofights.
---
4. ???
---
5. Profit
---
If the original owner doesn‚Äôt take them away, you should and up with those items, yes.
---
Yes EVE University is a very good place to start especially if you have long term interest in the game. They have a variety of of different locations to base out of and offer classes on various activities available in the game.
---
Can't help the fact you can't see the nuance between "I am horde" and "I am csm with a horde background". Can't fix that for you.
---
cause gobbins doesn't do them often.
---
and goons already know most of whats in their speech, so mittani just needs to summarize.
---
honestly would be fun to send both Gobbins and Mittani to CCP at the same time, see how the game developers sweat over both of them staring at them.
---
Renters arent people tho
---
&gt; The same dude who tells me that I can't know what was in his head is now telling me what's in my head. Ok.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I guess I got confused by your constant outbursts of what appear to be unprovoked anger. It‚Äôs ok though, faux outrage at other people‚Äôs hypocrisy while actively being hypocritical is all the rage these days.
---
&gt; As I said before, and it bears repeating, I'm out of patience with people who are still claiming I did something wrong, when they've got no evidence, and everybody involved has confirmed that I did nothing wrong.
---
We are now three layers into me repeating the same thing. You win. I won‚Äôt say anything more about it. Of course the fact that you‚Äôre still here pushing it amuses the fuck out of me because either you‚Äôre being hypocritical or there‚Äôs some reason you feel compelled to keep on about it. Who knows, maybe you‚Äôll claim you‚Äôre just trolling me for giggles. Or it could be a guilty conscience. As you said I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in your head.
---
&gt; The part I don't get is why you're still posting if you've given up and won't talk about it anymore.
---
Given that you keep responding to me, this is a shocking statement. I have some opinions about why you keep responding though.
---
No I wanna say that every MMO is broken :D and like another poster mentioned down below, most MMOs are resetting by raising lvl cap. I just wanna say that you can't balance it for everybody.
---
So good organizational structure that attracts dedicated membership makes the game broken? 
---
We all play within the same boundaries...Goons just do it better than everyone else. Isnt CCPs fault groups like NC and PL cut their own noses off to spite their face.
---
Panfam did the same thing for our faction fort in SAH a couple months ago.
---
I guess karma had his way to sucker punch you at the next corner , huh ?
---
Yeah we warped into him after he taunted us. We had destroyers and he had a frigate.
---
In a large nullsec group, station trading changes a bit depending on your choice of where your group lives, it depends on how big your alliance trade hub is + how big NPC null trade hubs are (here's a trade hub size ranking [chart](https://eve-marketdata.com/rank/markethubs). They are much smaller than Jita, but they still stock a good amount if it's big enough. It means less competition, but also less volume if you want to do station trading. It can be quite inconvenient to be so far from Jita if you want to station trade in Jita, which is why most nullsec groups recommend a Jita alt, even if it stays alpha. The most advanced way of trading is to train up to a Jump Freighter and stock NPC null and your alliance's trade hubs from Jita, but these require omega and a good amount of capital for the goods + Jump Freighter (around 10 billions for the JF + however ISK you want to invest, usually also in the multiple billions). Also having multiple accounts that can light a cyno + scout is necessary to protect that huge investment (you'll find that most very lucrative ISK making opportunities require multiple omega accounts).
---
Large nullsec groups provide the best protection and support for new players, free ships, free skill books, mentoring. For pvp fleets, more ships are given out to new players and there are a lot of SRP (ship replacement programs) so if you can risk your own ships without taking a big loss if it gets destroyed. Nobody will mind if you ask questions and there will usually always be experienced members online to help you (there are probably even experienced station traders that can help you more than I can). 
---
Null usually has the best sites for everything PvE, so you can usually make the best money ratting, mining, exploring and missioning. They run their own incursion fleets too, some even available to alphas (although not at 100m ISK/hr, but pretty good still). In terms of using a single account to make ISK, null is probably the best place for that. Large nullsec groups provide the protection you need for mostly safe PvE. As a line member, though, you might feel like your impact is small, which is the usually downside of being in a large nullsec alliance.
---
For differences in-between different areas of space (I think this is your question?), you'll find that hisec has low risk and low isk, lowsec has high risk, medium isk, null has low-moderate risk and high isk. Wormholes has the highest risk and high isk, but that's a can of worm you probably should open when you have more experience in the game (outside of exploration).
---
So, transitioning to omega is really whenever you feel restricted by a few things alpha's can't do. There's no prep you gotta do. CCP has a made a [short list](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/213020969-Alpha-and-Omega-Clone) the differences in-between alpha and omega, but here are the main ones:  
---
\- Alphas train skills at half the speed, are limited to a 24h skill queue and maximum 5 million skillpoints
---
\- Use a cloak
---
\- Light a cyno
---
\- Limited to T1 sub-caps and T1 Large Weapons
---
\- Limited on a lot of small skills that give you bonuses that add up.
---
\- Only 1 client can be run at once (no multi-boxing).
---
There are a lot of things you can do as an alpha, but everything is just better as an omega. I'd say get in corp, play for a month or 2, and if you still like the game, it's a good idea to upgrade to omega. If you're very sure you will like the game, you can even upgrade now since doubling the skill training speed and the unlimited length skill queue can have a big impact on the speed at which you acquire new skills and ships to fly.
---
The prep I was talking about before moving to omega is only required if you want to play Eve Online for free in 15 days (or if you want to pay for 1 month omega with real money and then play for free afterwards). If you're planning on paying for omega, just do it as soon as you're confident you like playing Eve Online.
---
Yip, thats the weird spot EVE has been forever
---
Sounds like you are not looking at Local and probably dscan. LowSec is murder zone. If there is anyone else in system (look at Local) then they are jack the ripper and you're the virgin hooker.
---
What are the differences between a Lance and a Reaper DD, please ?
---
shut up troll and go back to the toilet you live in, it wasnt just 1 event, but with not much brain theres not enough capacity to memorize things further back than a few weeks, just like a mayfly.
---
The whole strategy started already with inauguration of Extractors/Injectors, but thats too far back for you I guess ...
---
Also you just simply do not get the meta at all what leads me to the conclusion you are just a kid ranting from moms basement ...
---
Names?
---
Have you played in the last years? The biggest complaint isn't that rorq yield is too strong or that VNI's are too good. The biggest complaint is that you can do almost nothing about it. Do you know how hard it is to kill a rorq under the goon umbrella? Do you know what lengths people have to go to to even have the most miniscule of effects on the Delve economy? Have you ever witnessed the joy that is gatecamping titans? The problem people complain about is that head on can counter asymmetric no problem.
---
Poor devs would crawl under their desks
---
Then why isn't everyone else deploying hundreds of Rorquals and building hundreds of Titans?
---
Lol, 'call him crazy, that'll work!'  Tell me doctor where did you get your degree?
---
bitch check my histry...  
---
ive been on dots since 1992. Trump aint even speak english then
---
I just felt some itching on my butt ....
---
i man its goons, so picture your opinion if you view them as.
---
quiet mining folks, who have been asked to form for a fight. theyre frekin super excited about structure bashes lol. unfortunatly (and its factual no one could say different) goon members are people who like winning, with no actual challenge. eve players used to have as many people wanting to fight on the underdogs side as the winning side. 
---
in my opinion skill injectors gave hi sec duders access to capitals and rorquals for instance, and then supers without any previous training or dedication to want to get into one. they all seem to have join goons as theyre a bunch of excessively blobing (more than the average eve group), risk adverse, carebears who seem to just be happy to be thre even if its structure grinding.
---
They can't gather feedback because they can't tell players what CCP are planning. They can gather the feedback that gets posted to reddit twice a month but so can CCP.
---
Flying my first apocalypse in low sec with no large guns and shit fit. Proceeded to get salty as fuck after. I do laugh at it now in my tactical destroyer with a higher Dps than the shit fit apocalypse
---
You sound mad.  You want to fight, yet you are too weak to fight.  
---
You seem unhappy that while you dont like to farm in a pve sense, you also really dont like to be farmed in a pvp sense.
---
Welcome to what every other entity has experienced at some point on this server.  Retard.
---
yeah turns out it was a bad idea to give randoms goons the key's to there lance's, not to worry the key's are now in a bottomless pit some where.
---
I unironically want this for FW. The creeps would be the empire ships. And the heroes would be the FW players. FW is already gimmicky and based on shooting NPCs, so it wouldn't even change that much.
---
I wasn't playing yet back when N3 was a thing, I was referring to the post-N3 NC/PL actually. So to me NC/PL have always been a relatively """""small""""" group of specialized players heavily focusing on SC/titans, they were fielding lots of titans/supers for sure but ultimately not that much people compared to other entities able to field impressive numbers of fleets/players. 
---
And Big Buddha Cheese currently, and you? :)
---
Post WWB the Moneybadgers were poised to form the dominant group in the game...
---
Instead NC and PL decided to push away TEST CO2 and then GoTG. 
---
And now whine about being unable to counter an enemy with a superior numbers count and industrial back bone.
---
Oops.
---
E. Instead of spear heading the next dominant coalition in the game drove away TEST CO2 and GOTG....2 of 3 into the arms of Goons ultimately.
---
you say this like goons or other entities have not been deemed unassailable in the past and still ended up getting dunked on, and then the cycle starts again
---
Not to mention needing a holding toon logged off in a POS in order to put in another build job in the SCAA
---
Forgot to mention. Think about it from both sides, and not just biased screeching like you. Let me guess, you are just some of the stupid players that lost stuff to Delve hunters and is now salty, instead of thinking about why you lost your stuff (because you simply were te lazy or to stupid) ...
---
[This](https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/XXkuKugJaChhZDAth) should paint a bit clearer of a picture though it shows a much larger number of Hole Control pilots than were initially around. I think the main motivation for switching sides was simply that the defenders had a solid amount of capitals, a manned and gunned structure and a few different subcapital options available (notably lots of bhaalgorns) but *still* asked for help with the heavy lifting. I get that comes across as sort of e-bushido but it's pretty poor form to be even on numbers with so many strong tools available and ask for another fleet of the same size to help.
---
As a disclaimer, I can't speak for Starfleetcommander or Cable so they may have a reason that's above my lack of wig status.
---
Bad advice is bad. Stabs won't save you from a bubble
---
üò±
---
wtf do you mean ccp made supers and titans hugely easier to acquire and lowered a hard time investment to just a money investment??? 
---
goons WORKED for this 2000 player blob
---
No. The point of the damage cap was to make it so that having a bigger blob doesnt let you just evaporate structures.
---
and holocaust denial...
---
Was part of Her and HED-GP fights during Catch eviction, can confirm.
---
Fucking nullified railgu fleets. Like 120 railgus popping frigs st 200km
---
game mechanics makes it veeeeeeeeeeerrry hard to fuck up. that's what people have been talking about the past 5 years in regards to EVE becoming safer.
---
A nice fight we have with WAFFLES public fleet recently.
---
Been sitting on this footage since I took it and thought I'd use it in an upcoming long video but I've changed ideas so decided to render it out as a solo clip. 
---
**Ships Flown:**
---
Guardian (Main Window - Logistics)
---
Damnation (Small Window - Links)
---
**Battle Report**
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30045316/201905272000/
---
**Track Used:**
---
22h39 - DANGER
---
---------------------------------------------
---
**Recording/Editing Setup:**
---
I record 2560 x 1440 Windowed clients and overlay the 2nd most active one in the bottom left (via OBS) so you can get a feel for what else is going on. Main recording is downcaled to 1920 x 1080 to make it more fitting to what people have viewing wise.
---
I then import the footage into DaVinci Resolve 16 (Free Version) and Edit and render the final product there.
---
In regards to how I do multiple clients at once, I have my sources in OBS set up like[ this](https://i.imgur.com/DSIMhxi.png) 
---
They are set to capture specific game windows, when I go on fleets I decide which window will be which and change accordingly[ like so](https://i.imgur.com/22bhlHz.png) by right clicking on the source -&gt; Properties
---
(Once logged in each client will show as exefile.exe: char name)
---
I have a 3rd source which is on top of those 2 called "Escalation" in case of dread/carrier/super usage mid fight. It's a bit of a cluster to sort it out in a hurry but it works.
---
I just toggle visibility (the eye icon) as and when needed (after selecting the client as described above), since sources visibility depend on their order in the list, when toggled it fully overlaps.
---
You must have missed what he meant and the fact that all keeps will be killed like this from now on. Out of range of the keeps defenses so it's rendered useless as a defensive structure.
---
Probably because we don't do a pastaside talk every saturday
---
Fuck, well I guess I need to check my privilege then..
---
What happened to all that rental isk?
---
I mean P2W is already in the game
---
&gt; They can't gather feedback because they can't tell players what CCP are planning. 
---
They can gather on what they think are the issues, they can gather feedback on difference suggestions. CCP also isn't forced to hide all the changes they are making. They can gather feedback after Sisi patches just like what happened with HS.
---
And again if CCP is able to also read those suggestions on reddit and then brought them in front of the CSM who will most likely confirm those ... what is wrong ?
---
and CCP changing mechanics had nothing to do with it.
---
Plenty of other empire-building-oriented alliances are working on it?  I mean, TEST, Frat, and GotG (at least, they _were_, I'm not sure how they're faring now) seem to be following that path.  We got in early, but it's clearly viable for more than just GSF.
---
Wow... That really doesn't sound like a good idea for investments! lol
---
Thanks for the explanation pal xD
---
One question though... How the fuck does one get a original BP for something like this without buying for this exorbitant amounts from players? O.o
---
Are they seeded once in a life time or something? :(
---
LowSec is worth it if you are starting out and that's assuming you have fast align and are paying attention to local, dscan, and your overview. Most ships have a cooldown coming out of cloak before they lock you. The exception is covert bombers. You cannot be bubbled in lowsec so I'd say it may be the best place for you to learn. It's far more dangerous in wormholes and null for different reasons and bubbles is shared between them.
---
They've made tanking it so impossible it's the only way to do it. Undock camping was a way to generate fights, and clearly the devs who came up with the Citadel madness didn't want that.
---
Why should it be that way? Just honest curiosity.
---
Wonder if the Northern Overlords will allow these kills to make the next NER..
---
lmfao if you think most clueless whales aren‚Äôt titan pilots
---
Cornak's been big on FW and fixing Lowsec in his platform.
---
Shit, its almost like they would rather shoot spaceships than form a permanent, incontestable blob.
---
Lmao, those fucking idiots
---
Okay. And what do you now?
---
No one is going to fight you.
---
I was bopping around my home pipe in a 25 killmark Garmur (a personal best) and saw a war target VNI moving through. Followed him through a gate and jumped him on the other side. MWD on, hit orbit because I thought it was set to 40km. Turns out it was set to 1km. I was scrammed before I could react.
---
RIP Garmur.
---
Gobbins not only has great input for the future of Eve he took it upon himself to create an environment to train new players so they would stay instead of getting discouraged early on. I read news bit on a gaming site about Horde and it brought me back. I was so intrigued I left my 140m sp character on ice and started new. I'm still here and I have progressed to  owning a super and a fax alt ect...
---
that bee isnt thicc enough to be realistic
---
Local population and your directional scanner are your best friends. Lowsec ratting when there are folks in local can be very risky if you're not prepared to fight them. If I'm roaming lowsec and find some guy derping in a belt, you bet I'm going to try to pop him. Though I'll usually throw him some isk for a new ship if he's a newbro.
---
Point is you act like it just happened out of the blue, thousands of Goon line members just coincidentally made same decisions and nothing to do with CCP or Goon managements decisions.
---
Why do Goons drop Supers and Titans on roamers then if management are not prioritizing industrial output?
---
They didnt want to blue up every group there was.... if you want serenity keep on working towards that I guess.  You'll end up with conflicts like this every time and supposed ops that were "years in the making" that will amount to no fights.
---
One is a QnA session.
---
The other is a masturbation session.
---
And Mittens does not last 2h.
---
I really hope you are right, besides being the place I live in and would love to see full of people, I sincerely think that it would really help the game in general by both being a place for small groups that enjoy small gangs and solo PVP and as a middle ground between HS and NS.
---
I recommend not awoxing them over the loss of a 6m ship lol. Show you're tougher than that and people will respect you more.
---
lol
---
Meh. I listened to Cornak's CSM interview and he at least hit the nail on the head with FW's problems. I thought the solutions could be fleshed out more, but if those problems at least get addressed in some way then we should be going in the right direction.
---
The fundamental difference between the north and the goons is that what the goons strive for is what the North wants to avoid.
---
Congratulations on winning, enjoy those fights.
---
For a keep? Under an hour.
---
Goons aren't bored. But they undock. You should try that.
---
Pathetic legions
---
How is that a problem, why would I care what other people do or make? 
---
I used to run 7 accounts mostly in PVP, it all ended up being boring and impersonal. Now I only run 1 account and it's much more fulfilling, I have way more meaningful interaction, contact and teamwork with other players.
---
Goons already dickswing this hatf when its not that strategic.  
---
Even if the games changes to make that different, unless it also resets what is already made, it won't make much of a difference in the outcome.
---
yeah but its the good one ok
---
Truly the days are numbered for null security space.
---
"just imagine the target is a haven"
---
It's a different mentality. If I had to pick between fighting and winning, and having both wasn't an option, I'd pick winning every time.
---
Can't deny that was a pretty death for millions of non-Capsuleers.  They had a good view from their windows.
---
CSM minutes will be a joy to read!
---
Thanks for answering.
---
Glad cause I was actually doing some L3 with my Myrmidon when bored from HIght sec explo , was planning a Gila for the next ship .
---
I have already written off my original account when I restarted Eve, until I decided to send in a ticket, because why not? I got back into my original char within just a few hours. I know having issues resolved so quickly isn't the norm, so thanks for that, and thanks for your service GMs.
---
There are games where the GM would just tell you to get fucked, but in nicer words.
---
I also live there and get my content from here and FW is IMO the key to maintain a healthy PvP game, create plenty of content etc. I hope I'm right too.
---
&gt;ecause the Goon high command picks people that will benefit their alliance and their vision for the game, with general disregard for other views. They tell the whole alliance who to vote for, and open rebellion against it can get you into some serious problems. It's rather authoritarian, and
---
Nullsec is more than 20% of the player base
---
Because a) NS candidates have been showing they understand the issues with LS for years and b) I'd really like just one dude on the CSM whose number 1 priority is LS/FW. Fairly sure it won't happen though.
---
That wasn't what he said. He said he wouldn't be opposed to something but would consider the merits prior to forming an opinion.
---
They were used for the largest Titan/Supercapital-Force in EVE until autistic screeching made CCP cjange the whole meta of aquiring the wealth to build them ...
---
The safest things to do are probably ratting/missions in highsec or join a Corp and rat/mission in null
---
\*sips Yorkshire Gold
---
The problem of how the game has become was glaringly obvious in hindsight since WWB.
---
At a certain point a force is so strong that its easier to just move out of the way rather than fight. 
---
And on the rare occasions large forces fight, you'll get 2 battles before one side realizes that its time to just get ouf of the way.
---
The days of fighting till the bitter end, ended with the fountain war.
---
At least we got a book to remember it by.
---
Wait, isk matters?
---
CCP wants to attract the dungeon team player types. Those who want 2 always win but have it be close sometimes. Group's who get drunk and PVE together all night. People looking for a relaxing diversion with friends.  This is a big whale in CCPs eye's.  Sprearing it without disturbing null sec would be a huge win.
---
good shit john
---
120 railgus &lt;---&gt; 1500 Titans &amp; supers ... you get the difference ?
---
it's not obtainable anymore since 2008? or something, only buyable from players
---
I wonder if you kill a ship with that gold ammo ... if you're allowed to sell it back for real money :P
---
Tfw you come from the chinese server into another one
---
I'm not doing anything of the sort -- a massive buildup of titans was absolutely encouraged by leadership as a hedge against all-of-eve deciding to try to evict us again.  As far as they're concerned, that's the enemy: effectively everyone not-us, so we "need" a fleet capable of fighting everyone not-us.
---
&gt;Why do Goons drop Supers and Titans on roamers then if management are not prioritizing industrial output?
---
You drop supers it's funny, people like to use their toys, and, as always, our home is not the place for "good fights"?
---
Leadership is for sure encouraging industrial output: it lines member pockets, it lines alliance pockets, it improves our space.  It's a win for everyone living there.
---
It doesnt matter anymore. Unless CCP takes away what is already built, the only changes they can make is to nerf them so hard into the ground that everyone unsubs their super.
---
When CCP push major features to SISI it's been pretty much proven that, outside of 1 or 2 database stat tweaks, that it's too late to change much. 
---
There's going to be fundamental misunderstandings between nullsec FC type players, who fly solo fits like [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72389948/) and [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/58948050/), when it comes to gameplay they don't interact with. They can probably give some relevant general input but when they've never even been effected by lowsec super mechanics, when their interaction with deadspace beacons is limited to DED sites they run, when they've never theorycrafted a solo frigate and when they've never even interacted with faction warfare PVE what can they really say when it comes to upcoming features/changes.
---
It's a line deathmatch! If there's more than one person left at the finish line, kill them!
---
10% TiDi will always leave you with enough time to react, even if you have the neural capabilities of a nettle jelly ....
---
I always wanted to see a 9 lane 3D moba mode for Valkyrie with rogue drones as lane minions and sentry guns/npcs as merc camps/ jungle monsters haha
---
Honestly though, I think it'd have been way too complicated :P
---
Agreed, we are on the same page there, but I would also like to see some love given to non-FW Lowsec. I had a lot of fun fooling around Ami some years ago, great fun but no that much people around due to the lack of opportunities.
---
And yet when a fight is brought to their door step they tuck tail and run and whine about numbers...
---
The need to spread on more systems will by default make them less secure because you have less concentration.  Granted, you can have enough warm bodies to cover all fairly well, but nevertheless if you are less concentrated you are less secure
---
so like ... half of KarmaFleet ?
---
I don't feel bad for them, i'm just worried about the game being a bit too one-sided for the years to come. I hope i'm wrong though
---
A reaper DD is similar to the lance, but sweeps the beam over a targeted area. Don't recall how/if the damage per tick differs though.
---
Because no one else in the game has perfected weaponized autism the way Goons have.
---
Yes. They didn' t even need to use those,  at the time, but the biggest thing Brave was flying at the time was Eagle fleets. Extremely asymmetric warfare that we had no chance of winning. Their 60+ archon blob alone was more carriers than we had.
---
So what‚Äôs the Lance then ?
---
Teizd? :p
---
In the past sure.
---
Fair enough!
---
In Horde we don't drop caps on people looking for gud fites.
---
We understand that absolute safety is not compatible with fun.
---
Why bad idea? 
---
They havent done it in awhile, but Horde started as a nomadic group when they were smaller. 
---
Their logistics wing is good enough to set up camp in a week elsewhere.
---
Being in the same place forever is boring.
---
5 years ago and how many versions of the nullsec meta lster.
---
I can't make sense of that link lol but it looks interesting I'll give it another look. Does kinda seem like hammerwerke just got blobbed tbh especially knowing the kind of numbers that holesale alone can bring but if it was a fair fight then fair enough \*thumbs up\*
---
You fool, thinking this has anything to do with CCP. You want autochess, organize it. It doesn't need to be "implemented" in a sandbox game to work. Better yet, for 20 billion I will do most of the work for you and you can just enjoy playing.
---
Don't get me wrong I'm not anti-boxing, just pointing out that the previous poster's argument is kinda voided by the fact that the majority of boxers you come across are people causing isk/mineral inflation with carbon copy alts.
---
PvP boxers and even 'actively' boxed PvE (ie not just x drone/mining boats) are actually fairly interesting playstyles. As a former WHer and cap pilot (and also some small scale incursion boxing as part of larger fleets) I understand that varied roles for alts are actually fairly interesting/helpful unlike warping 10 VNIs/rorquals into different sites and then watching intel and netflix whilst your wallet blinks.
---
"Constant outbursts." What are you talking about? "Unprovoked anger?" You accused me of "getting away with murder." 
---
You don't seem to have any idea what I went through during that two weeks. And you keep doing the same fucking thing every time to you respond - "guilty conscience." 
---
Seriously, go fuck yourself.
---
Different strokes.  You're not playing the game wrong, and neither are we.
---
Is that Jinx?
---
&gt; and is now salty
---
I've lost 1 Viator in Delve in the last two years.  Thanks for reading you fucking moron.
---
I dont expect anyone to fight for me...but im also not going to whine because a bigger group comes to burn my house down when I made no effort to oppose them.
---
NCPL had opportunity to form a counterweight to Goons and CFC....they chose to burn neighbours houses instead...and now cry they dont have enough bodies to hold down their own fort.
---
[They do make an attractive duo](https://imgur.com/a/ZfHjKzI).
---
The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades.
---
Yes because every FW pilot is totally able to fit his own top tier fits, run LS/FW PvE, and is has been using LP.
---
Oh wait I've been in several corp in LS and FW and my fits are also PGL level, I've never run any fucking mission outside of lvl 1 in HS and I'm probably sitting on a few million isk in LP I'm too lazy to collect.
---
You're asking too much.
---
I dont think you actually understand being a goon they will sit on coms and grind down upwells all take the piss outa each other.... its a social thing
---
But both is an option actually.
---
Oh sorry, maybe should have been a bit clearer... The Lance DD fires a beam towards a selected point in space and does continuous damage to any entity that comes in contact with it.
---
So Lance = straight beam that does not move 
---
And Reaper = Beam that emerges from your titan and sweeps the other end of the beam from point a to point b
---
This game like trying to change the past.
---
So all these discussions here boil down to the same point: "Its ok when WE do it, but not when THEY do it!" from both sides at all times ....
---
Those are insanely expensive.
---
Maybe if our enemies stopped spending their time coming up with excuses and started working on solutions, they'd have a chance.
---
I'm allowed to criticise your game strategy though and see how it unfolds in terms of consequeces for the game.
---
No, the point was that you couldn't land 300 caps and evaporate a structure in one volley.
---
So? That's, presumably, what you want. Any given desire is not universal.
---
Goons don't care about fights, just winning.
---
Not to us, we are loaded.
---
Nobody should feel bad for ncpl, they will be just fine when goons go away. This is about preventing this server becomming a 2nd serenity.
---
Ah now I get it, I have to throw around insults to be respected here. Couldn't you have told this earlier you beardless adolescent teat sucker?
---
Thanks for posting gorski, Waching this nerd get roasted harder than a pig in a Carolina pig roast is petty funny.
---
Then why does Pandemic Horde exist?
---
You suck
---
What do you think Legacy would do if goons invaded lol.
---
Omg this is amazing. Please someone tell me this is new content and we‚Äôre going to get more!
---
Wife called for me, I thought I clicked "dock" but just hit warp. Was killed on the station several hours later. Almost made it to downtime. Mostly I was just sad because lowsec is dead enough that I could afk on a station in a porpoise for 4 hours before dying.
---
LOL!!! i love it
---
I'll answer. The answer is that we don't care how the game unfolds. We don't see ourselves as the stewards of the health of the game; that's CCP's job. It's what we pay them to do. Literally. Don't like it? Too fuckin' bad.
---
Wait what? I thought you docked it up. Did you get that "log off mid docking dumps you randomly in space" thing too? I had a VNI that way but it did end up logging safely. Logged back in to find out I'm in space??? :ccp:
---
Do you have antialiasing disabled?
---
The solution is injecting Rorquals (at least 5 per player) and mine the shit out of TQ. You know that is the most beloved thing for PvP-Players to do in a GAME. I mean if I was a chinese gold farmer slave and my boss would harass me for not grinding ressources 12hrs a day, then I maybe would consider doing this ...
---
Is this the newest form of harvesting newbies to work for free?
---
This is hilarious to read as a third party
---
Here's Cornak's write-up:  [https://www.voteforcornak.com/lowsec](https://www.voteforcornak.com/lowsec) 
---
He also has an AMA thread here about it.
---
now that is what i call pod-racing
---
So what you're saying is that NC alone being able to field 200+ titans for the 5 years before The Imperium grew was perfectly fine?
---
I'd play that
---
How long did it take to seed all the freighters ?
---
your face sucks
---
As a Goon, I hope that this shakes things up.  Frankly, NC/PL have been largely on autopilot or in other games of late.  The NCdock meme has legs for that reason.  PL has seemed like a paper tiger at times.  I hope that this war does one or more of the following:
---
1) Wakes up NC/PL and makes them login/undock and fight again, bringing them back to the game.
---
2) If NC/PL is unable or unwilling to adapt to the current meta, and remember what they can do, that this emboldens the young turks of Eve to knock them down and assume their role.
---
3) Disrupts some Null sec space where one or more smaller groups set up shop and start growing, and making content for all.
---
4) Creates a balkanized area free of renting, with plentiful pvp and random stuff happening.
---
5) Disrupts or alters renting in general, I find renting (even our own) to be somewhat of a blight on the game.  It fosters way too much botting, and it seems to keep small groups weak.  
---
6) And maybe a tip of the hat from all to Horde, the oft used/abused cannon fodder who always seem game for a fight.  They often have to fight for their masters for their masters benefit, not their own.  And they do not get full rights to NC/PL space/stuff etc.  Yet Horde undocks and fights more than most.
---
Regardless, what I don't want is Goons to PIBC the server.  That will truly kill Eve.  I want more PVP, small and large.  I want a more dynamic server.  I am nowhere near the only one in Goons that feel this way.  We really want people to shoot, and people who shoot back are the best for this.
---
For my part I do try to do smallish subcap pvp fleets, both in and out of Delve.  I've taken on Rote Kapelle, TAPI, Horde and others in Delve with a few assault frigates and a Magus, no titans etc.  I have roamed across the map with less than 20 person fleets to try to find/make content.  I also encourage other Goons to do the same, and it seems to be having a modest amount of success.  If you have killed me, you might have received an Eve mail thanking you for the fight.
---
And, for the most part I try not to crap all over small groups both in Reddit and in game.  
---
So, whatever happens, I hope that many stop thinking "I can't fight Goliath"  and instead look to the cleared out area that we make and see an opportunity.  If we damage NC/PL enough, that the others in true Eve fashion, tear them apart and take their place.  
---
In short, I really hope that in some way, this will bring a useful, healthy, dose of chaos to Eve.
---
Hope some of you pod me soon, and have fun doing it.
---
Thx u so far going ok
---
this picture encapsulates the reason i don't play EVE anymore
---
yet goonswarm as an alliance has deployed to pvp more times than you guys the last 2 years, weird!
---
They are even more expensive than it looks. Add at least 1 Bil to each loss because there are Abyssal modules that were't properly count in the lost ISK sum.
---
Did fly with these dudes once and can't wait to fly again.
---
Would recommend for anyone that was too afraid to touch the invasion before but wants to try it!
---
And thanks Vincent for teaching me.
---
You act as if we are surprised at this outcome.
---
Agreed. As a newer player I am tired of being forced to fly in fleets I contribute nothing to, as I am not able to fly most of the ships that are called for. I hope this war ends soon so I can can start focusing on parts of the game I actually want to play.
---
I member
---
They said the same thing the first time folks killed a Keep with long range titan guns. Most keeps don't die this way. Uncontested ones do, sure.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/DttO9Qi.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/DttO9Qi.mp4)
---
Not for free, I received a cut from the profits a day after the fleet, was too sceptical at first.
---
I would be ok if sub-cap fleets mattered because you could fly tackle but the game is just Caps now at the strategic level this war is being fought at.
---
They are upset because their grand plan to timezone tank everything to AUTZ and then not fight because "goons will burn themselves out and leave" isn't working because we still formed 350+ titans in AUTZ and we love burning down structures when they are the homes of our enemies.
---
&gt; once upon a time
---
Yes. Keepstars didn‚Äôt exist either. MMO‚Äôs change over time.
---
Last time people whined that THE MOST EXPENSIVE STRUCTURE KILLED WITH CARRIERS DONT EVEN HAVE TO PUT YOUR TOYS ON THE FIELD RAH RAH.
---
You can‚Äôt always please every player and this player base is worse than most because separating the null politics and baseless hatred from actionable feedback is really hard. We‚Äôre our own worst enemies.
---
That sounds like a terrible solution, but you do you.
---
Oh no, don't get me wrong, I don't mind the moving part. What I do mind is how small gangs roaming Gem and Trib look like they're having a ton of fun while we wait to run stratops that go nowhere. The answer to everything is "join SH1 standing" where someone might be camping a gate somewhere. Fishing/hunting around goon blobs is difficult but I might be getting better at it. Honestly I'm still very much wet behind the ears and whining like a noob would but that's just my perspective.

Detach the directional scan thing with the \[o\] button in the corner of the Directional Scan element. Keep that on screen somewhere (I like middle left). It scans 14.3 AU by default, you can narrow and widen it. You can also narrow the angle, based on camera direction, it's spherical by default.
---
&gt; Because ncpl never outnumbered their enemy to such a massive extent. Because when ncpl had that superiority, they didn't have it because they bunkered down in a region and just refused to interact with anyone else while building it. Because when ncpl had it, they had actual enemies aside from one or maybe two other fucking blocks.
---
NCPL always overwhelmingly outnumbered their victims.  Theirs was a bullying playstyle that constantly avoided conflict with pre-WWB goons or the drone region Russians in favor of dunking hopelessly outclassed newbro-friendly entities.  Risk aversion at its finest.
---
krabbing in deklein

In the corner I really want it to say, ‚Äú provi station planning committee submits proposals for how to renovate empty hangars‚Äù .

That's not how the CSM works tho. The CSM is being heavily used for metagaming
---
And yet they still formed a 3000 man blob fest evicting the Imperium in 2015.
---
Check yourself, idiot.

absolute gold.
---
Do you even read what you post?
---
ningen we are better at being bob than they ever were
---
&gt; Plus, theres no "logistics" to figure out really, if you really want to sell it in Jita you can just ship it up there.
---
That's like the definition of logistics. You have to calculate the m3, the number of jumps/distance, then look at freight services in your area to calculate the cost of shipping, then have to determine your profit vs selling locally to make sure it's cost effective to ship. 
---
&gt;Delve scraps are also good scraps.
---
Salvage does not sell well in 1DQ, unless things have changed recently. Not saying a noobie can't make some money, but it's a lot of extra work over collecting a bounty payment, and they are very likely to get killed transporting that salvage and loot via T1 indy to 1DQ via gating/jump bridging. The gates and bridges around 1DQ are heavily camped. Need a jump drive capable ship to jump directly to the 1DQ cyno, so that noobie will also have to rely on / pay someone to transport their cargo for them as well.
---
Fuckkkk I hate to admit this in public forum but not long ago I was running C5 sites with dual box RR Leshaks.
---
Dropped an MTU in the site and started to kite in one direction. Next wave BS spawns close to the MTU so I tried fleet warping back to the MTU (about 150km off it at this point) without realizing one of my Shaks was pointed by a frig rat.....
---
I noticed right as I was about to enter warp and tried spamming stop ship but I was too late.
---
So one Leshak warps to the MTU while the other one sits there pointed. By that point it was too late, obviously they were out of RR range of each other and I ended up losing both. About 3.5 bil. Luckily I was able to loot most of the dead space modules and made like 1.4 back.
---
Its a grind, and it keeps on growing. FTFY 
---
Basically adapting to the chinese gaming culture
---
So we're the Bobbest.
---
Blame Kun‚Äômi
---
Who dat??
---
I got gaypwned
---
Please go back to the csm next year.  You were good.
---
&gt;Legacy is actively following that path and reaping the rewards of it.
---
they're reaping the rewards of blueing us you mean
---
Not at all, but I will interrogate your conception of 'winning'.
---
yes antialiasing is disable
---
Like the other side they just undock when overwhelmingly outnumbering the other side. If its not that way ... well you remember saranen ?
---
Ha I was mostly kidding.  I‚Äôm not bent out about it at all.  Actually it was a great learning experience.  Now I‚Äôm all about that Dscan!
---
If 'success' unfolds into turning the game into a desert-like Chinese server than I will gladly fail.
---
Where can I buy some gobloons???
---
Is there any document where CCP says what the exact method is? STV isn't a single method but a group of similar systems. The devil lies in the detail. 
---
"It is theoretically but not practically possible to game the system[...]"
---
erm... It depends on what you consider "to game the system". Tactical voting is definetely a thing. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting#Single_transferable_vote But it's in nearly every system.
---
The advise "just put your favorite candidate up top" isn't as simple as the usual variants of this voting system aren't monotone. To know is the CCP's CSM version is we would actually need to know their exact version. The missing monotonicity means that it isn't allowed as a voting system in some countries (for example Germany).
---
So we shall ruin the 2nd EVE Server with Turbo-Krab-MegaCos working for the RMT riches of their leaders and ruining the economy to the point where PLEX sub cost 20 Bil. ISK like on Serenity? Fuck off, honestly ...
---
Yea. I'm actuality quite sad Yulai collapsed that quickly afterwards. I had plans to go after them once the war ended.
---
Btw, it's not aimed at you :-)
---
Nice AR, Chill music, Clear fleet comms, ty. You should tag this ASMR.
---
Lmfao dude NC/PL fielded 10000s against us in the Casino Wars and now ‚ÄúREEEEEEE GOONS ARE OPPPPPP‚Äù
---
well, it's good to see that even within goons there are some people that actually want to play a spaceship game rather than sucking roids all day. I haven't had the pleasure to fight you yet i think, be sure we'll give you content if you happen to wander through Scalding pass with your gang ;)
---
&gt; anyone who wants to attack you needs to ~~scan you down first~~ have scanned down the sig before you got to the system so they can warp right to you once they see somebody's in there. 
---
PVE activities in low are generally dangerous (and also not worth ISK commensurate with the danger) but the key to survival is situational awareness. Best gotten with some familiarity with the area you're playing in. If you know that those guys in local are industrialists who probably aren't out hunting you that's one thing, but generally if you're not alone in system you need to be ready to fight or warp off from whatever you're doing. For PVE combat activities the safest thing is be doing something that will actually force a hunter to use combat probes, and be looking for those on dscan if you're not alone.
---
oh bois! Problem is solved now but idk how! all setting keep the same but after today DT everything is normal! 60fps for each window! :ccp:
---
I was thinking like that video of the soldiers when they give the monkey an AK-47 and laugh. Then it starts to fire it full auto randomly while they run off in terror. That was the picture in my mind when I heard "equip lance".
---
That is YOUR solution, exactly what Imperium did, and it was not because of own capabilities but by a patch catering the game to this playstyle literally ...
---
Haha thanks. As an aside, I'm told when I'm chatting with my Yeti I either have an ASMR voice or a boring voice, didn't include my mic audio in this but maybe I'll make a meme ASMR video at some point...
---
Just waiting till goons go home probably and then continue to do whatever it is they wanna do. Since panfam isn't very fond of pve it is hard to do any meaningfull damage to em by taking their sov. They can just take the fights they feel they can win and wait things out.

Big war in the north with GotG vs Imperium.  About this time last year corps started leaving MOA in large numbers for other GotG alliances/corps. 
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Mordus_Angels/corporations
---
Matteral has shit concerns and even worst ideas
---
Show me on this doll where the bad goon touched you.
---
It was a permanent and incontestable blob that got disbanded and started shooting each other and letting Goons grow in peace?
---
You're not even keeping your own story straight.
---
Pls do, you can just copy this picture for the reddit post about it.
---
:D I didn't figure it was
---
the setting of the picture is wrong, currently bees sit in basements and are highly concentrated on doing PvStructures in 10% self caused TiDi.
---
There‚Äôs always going to be some people salty at losing a Keepstar to a titan blob no matter the circumstances. People get salty at the MER when it literally has no impact on them; let alone losing a structure. You‚Äôre dreaming if you think people don‚Äôt get salty over the most irrelevant shit in this game and you‚Äôre being disingenuous if you think nobody is salty in this thread.
---
I'm already maintaining too many indexes. I prefer you guys just hold on to shintaht for a while longer :P
---
And yet I almost never rat or mine, I have two accounts that I pay for with real moneyv and I have a Titan, too. It's almost as if creative solutions are possible in Eve.
---
Let‚Äôs get some Fs in chat
---
meh abyssal PvP is terrible it's just rock,paper ,scissors. Turn up in a shiny rock you'l beat a shiny scissors and a t2 rock but lose to paper no matter what.
---
Still available !
---
If you don't like where you are at, or where it is going.. leave. There are multiple groups, big and small, that you may find a better fit. Sometimes you have to look around and try another "nullsec blob", or maybe wormholes, or a smaller group. Each one of the big nullsec groups has its own flavor, just find the one that you fit with best, both with your own personality and the directions/goals of the alliance/coalition.
---
Im surprised you wanted it.
---
Actually, that sounds very cool and it was what our group was looking for when we started in January. 
---
Well, since we did not get such content (none worth running in more people, accessible for low SP pilots, not necessarily alpha, but accessible from HS) only i am left playing EVE from my group now. :(
---
???
---
Nor did Goons?
---
They just adapted to the changes, rebuilt and closed the gap. Meanwhile NC./PL attacked provi again...
---
Sure
---
Then you are more typical for groups like PL than Goons, my accounts never ran on anything else than CC sub for close to 13 years now, last time I mined was 2009, 2013 I extracted ALL mining skills for Supercarrier chars. 
---
What itches me is that today with Rorquals and Injectors and a severe grade of autism you can reach what I reached in 13 years in ... well ... just a few months ...
---
Like I said I'm just whining lol. I figure there's no point leaving without learning as much as I can from horde so that's why I stick around.
---
"war"
---
That would b awesome
---
Difference is they consciously didn't go around making uncontestable blue donut blobs.
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers
---
Big scrap with the lads
---
As it turns out, motivation is a complex subject with no universal answers. Who knew?
---
Yet they are destroying the game.
---
I was in PL right before I joined Goonswarm. It sucked monkey nuts. They were a bunch of edgelords trying to impress each other with how elite they were, while shitting on everyone else in the alliance (but it was all ironic so it was ok). Granted, that was 2009, so I'm sure things have gone downhill since then.
---
Fly with nano gangs.
---
Shh, don‚Äôt speak the truth. Otherwise you‚Äôll upset them and they‚Äôll start yelling about ‚ÄúKrabs‚Äù again while literally abandoning 3 regions üëçüèΩ
---
Seems like that Orthrus is using probably 4 max rolled navy BCS to achieve max DPs and break the single repper iki
---
Feels like a Cerburs could do better, just some thoughts on paper
---
Is there splash explosion damage?  That would be great.  They are all there, the keepstar dies, and then you see 1/2 of the titans explode due to splash damage because they are too close.
---
&gt;No fatigue which caused players to be more cautious to use capitals in the game.
---
That's a weird way of saying that the largest superfleet ingame could go from one end of the map to another before the first cycle of a jamming falcon finished
---
I'm not sure how you got that out of "PL also cap-blobbed the shit out of us".
---
Respect for the explanation
---
LOL
---
Except that if you look at Ikitursa's stats, most people believe that bringing Ikitursa is like bringing shotgun to a rock-paper-scissors game.. ie, it is game breaking and will over power the usual curse-gila-vedmak holy abyssal pvp trinity.  The last few KMs shows that Orthrus may be able to counter Ikitursa.
---
&gt; The future of the game is fine
---
If you consider the current state of Serenity fine ... well the I guess you are right and I wish you a lot of fun ... it will be all about grinding resources for nothing meaningful ingame so much more left to RMT ....
---
After World War Bee, a massive conflict in which they took part on the "everyone" side to kick goons out of the north, they became a sov holding alliance as part of GotG coalition (to the present, the worst coalition in NS).
---
Then they started massively recruiting anything with a pulse and became a primer krabbing alliance.
---
When Goons pushed them a little some time later, they colapsed and died like a renter alliance would.
---
They suicided by krabbing.
---
The TFIs with triage were far worse imo. Then pantheon carriers if shit got dicey.
---
It's just STV, they use it all over the world. It's ideal for multi-entity elections because you actually have to get a majority of the votes to get a majority of the seats.
---
I haven't tried LS explo in a long time but when I did the rewards were shit compared to the risk. I endorse those who've already said "find a wormhole route to null," and do the same back to high once you're ready to cash out. Just find someplace without a lot of activity, be paying attention, have a safespot (preferably off d-scan from any celestial if you can manage that) and be ready to safelog if you must.
---
Learn to hack the cans at a distance that lets you immediately cloak up, if you're not gonna run as soon as somebody appears in local. And watch d-scan. Learn to watch d-scan while hacking.
---
someone ask the Mittani if he'd be willing. for the enjoyment of all humankind
---
Honestly, I was thinking the same thing. Theres a good number of Titans directly in the shockwave.
---
They could make it alone if winterco wasn't allied with panfam and skillu.
---
This is the only reason they allied the imperium.
---
Keep crying. Seeing an NC/PL member throw a temper tantrum in the middle of the square, lighting themselves on fire and whining because they lose is what makes me get out of bed in the morning.
---
Tbh PL dicking on early BRAVE was never something to be proud of, and don't get me wrong, there was a lot of PL Hubris deserving that slope now. My point is just that ll the posts here are the same cheap propaganda as it was back then the other way round ...
---
 T.
---
Gawpa
---
Unlike what the PL member says, my post is not really about how Keepstars are killed. It's more about the general direction the game is going in regards to supers/titans and how prevalent they become. 
---
None of this bodes well for people who enjoy PvP, especially PvP with subcaps.
---
I think you aren't wrong but citadels do take abit too long to take down.  And there is the faction warfare oppression from them but aside from those I like them in LS atm.
---
ü§î
---
2009 was Dominion, the patch that gave PL their superiority in titans &amp; Supers. litterally a few weeks befor the patch they were fleeing from Fountain from IT Forces, just to steamroll them after the patch ....
---
Try defending shit before you whinge about defenseless eh?
---
Matterall's platform mostly seemed like "I am big personality vote for me because of this."
---
For once I agree with you, squid.
---
Don't subcaps matter in battle to disable the cyno jammers before the actual cap fights? (I only fight in WH's so idk anything about SOV)
---
That's  racist!!!
---
yes that's correct
---
it's also not that relevant in the context of the point i was making
---
I member op
---
https://youtu.be/TTA2buWlNyM
---
Look at that wormhole eviction in the other thread by hole control. Epic fight with no super caps possible.
---
I think nullsec is fucked. Wormholes is where the game is at.
---
What if i told you that all of eve is not about nullsec pvp blocs
---
8/10 :)
---
Our Corp leader has put together a newbro intro to W-Space gas mining a few months ago, but the reddit post was shot down with everyone claiming it is a trap or scam because Wspace is spooky. 
---
Frequently people are really out there trying to help get people involved and teach them how to do things. Don‚Äôt risk a lot, and get out there to learn how to do things! Can‚Äôt learn without trying.
---
And yet 10-20 of them die daily regardless of super shield or not. Yes, I can see how it is truly impossible to kill rorquals in goon space.
---
If the plex is in the plex wallet, pretty sure it will stay with the account, but ISK, assets and plex that's not in the wallet will go to you.
---
It's called choice.
---
I don't want to be respected here.  It's fucking reddit.
---
Jesus, nearly 20 years ago
---
even "raising the level cap" in an eve sense by introducing a new ultra-mega titan or w/e wouldn't do anything other than make the price of injectors spike after CCP introduced that *amazing* mechanic
---
Fighting is the only way to combat it long term.  Ok we are not talking about a weak opponent ncpl if they had the balls to fight could do so. But they lack something and it's not just numbers to is preventing them from winning. Showing up is more than half the issue. 
---
I dont have an issue with the current landscape. Empires rise and fall there will be a time when the imperium falls. Ncpl used to be on top and now we see that crumbling down. I'm sure we will see wars between other groups as well I'd best we will go to war with test and legacy at some point. If only for fun if needed. 
---
This also creates space for other groups to come in and grow and develop power similar to the imperium.
---
And it's only going to get worse
---
Dscan is good for you. Also you could always challenge the guy who ganked you to a 1v1 once you get good. Great way to settle shit in corp. My kb's full of blue from duels lol.
---
Imagine when your only recourse to losing a keepstar is to bad grammar bait post on reddit.
---
Make eve 2 without rorquals, skill injectors, and damage caps
---
StainGuy is goon confirmed.
---
Eh I mean certainly theres a number of reasons to have multiple accounts, but the primary reason to play Eve imo---PvP---hardly requires it. Sure if you get hella skilled I'm sure you could multi box in PvP but then you're keeping track of 2,3,4 different ships making split-second decisions on all of them... I can barely manage that level of stress and decision-making on one account.
---
I only multi box when grinding ISK, because it's low-effort enough that I can do two accounts with relative ease.
---
Whats this a jean michelle jarre light show
---
They are gone. Feel free to start using implants over 10m.
---
How dare you disgrace Alan Jackson my shitty whinepost
---
More of a Richard Simmons jazzercise and cyclethon.
---
I mean you are allowed to fight back...but if surrender is all you can do then you are better off in another game.
---
Pretty much this, joining GotG is a death sentence for anyone who actually pvps for themselves.
---
Giving you points for self awareness, you deserve it. You know, I may find your obsession with goons a bit on the crazy side, but every day I think I agree with your points more and more. Perhaps because your posting is moving away from the silly 'grr gons' and becoming more in depth and critical of the state of EVE. Here's hoping you get elected and get a chance to spice things up. 
---
Who knows, maybe we'll see the day when you don't need your 70+ accounts to make a difference.
---
Fight the battlefield you're on. GSF could have easily complained just as much in WWB/casino war instead they went and rebuilt bigger better and ncpl have that opportunity now. Get better grow or make way for something new
---
The irony of this post is strong.
---
If you see someone in local then dock up or gtfo out of system.  Lowsec is all about getting hunted.  Or if you want to try to be ballsy about it be on your Dscan and keep scanning for them and when you see them on it then run ( But alot of people have cloaks and you wont see them on dscan coming.)  I would personally not bother ratting in the belts as the reward isnt worth the risk as compared to just doing lvl 4 missions in high sec ( you even get LP for it).  Its the DED and anoms in low sec you want (or the mining, particularly moons.)
---
Looks like I undocked.
---
And it took well over a year to get that toon, rather than 5 min and some isk.
---
I don't remember goons crying that eve was going to die and giving up though.
---
"snowflake"
---
Answer: They suffered during the first war in the north last year and as PB / Fade got purged by Imperial fleets, they fell back and started losing membership. Some corps joined GOTG, some left the north as a whole.
---
no one's "forcing" you to play honestly
---
you can leave whoever you're with and play however you want
---
Eh you could always make some "Skill injectors do not apply to these skills" bs
---
Yep, like a year ago. Actually it has been more like 60% discount for thanks for some additional codes
---
Hell, it ruins it for anyone living in the donut that also wants to press more that 'keep at 1000' and F1.
---
No, as I have a brain I am not putting my hand into a meatgrinder knowingly, I rather lurk in the dark and gank both of you ...
---
&gt; Caps being useless without sub support
---
Spidertanked (super)carriers needed to die.
---
Maybe we can all move on to a newer, better meme.
---
This was all planned at the bbq.
---
Ok so fighter spam with caps outside  of keep lock range...
---
Can you tank it in two Leshaks?
---
Super stronk
---
a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
---
That's nice.
---
Not in tidi tho, in tidi it takes like 8 hours
---
Something something wrecking machine.
---
Everything except strongholds yea
---
I'm in horde and couldn't give a toss about alliance 'status'. I'm here for fun and that has all but dried up. I don't even log in the last few days.
---
In WWB Goons docked up in Saranen, they did exactly the same PanFam is doing now, denying content in a situation they can't handle because outblobbed ...
---
Tbh I've lived in Delve and Fountain, and roamed in most other regions enough to get a general feel. No other coalition breaks the game like Goons do. I think it's safe to assume you don't live in NPC Delve, otherwise you'd have a better picture of the problem.
---
INIT titan pilot here, had my titan about 5 years now. Our alliance, more specifically my corp Project Valhalla (07NBD) has been pushing Titans hard over the last year, its the only method to retain relevancy and the main metric used to determine strength as a null-sec alliance. This has been the case for a number of years now and was first defined by Pandemic Legion as being a true SuperCap power.  
---
I believe, at least within my own corp and alliance that part of the reason Imperium has overtaken Panfam is ethos. The Imperium as a structure is one of the most stable coalitions EvE has ever seen, It has learn't from past alliance and coalition failures and ensured that its member alliances are bonded in trust and assisting each other makes us stronger as a whole.  
---
This paradigm shift in eve culture has left many of our rivals in the past. While we strive together in a common purpose with focus and respect for each other, hostile forces such as PanFam are still quick to stab each other in the back if the opportunity arises.  
---
This was made evident to me personally when we recruited some Nc refugees a few months back. They were literally shocked at the support and drive that we had, mining together as a corp to fund everyone a free titan, our builders offering at cost titans to all. Being ready and willing to defend allies caught rorqual mining. I believe it was described to me by one ex-NC pilot that if "idiot" got caught in his rorqual or super in NC he would be told to die like a man and probably be purged if it consistently happens, It took them by surprise that not only would we drop everything to assist someone that would be deemed an "idiot" but also our experienced members would talk them though it, calm them down, fill in for parts they forgot to do or report during their panic. For our Vets, its content generation while for the inexperienced pilot its a shield in-which they can develop under.  
---
I've been vocal about not "salting the earth" on this current campaign, I understand the why I just don't agree its in our best interest to keep the opposition in such a weakened. Unfortunately for our enemies they lack the thing that makes Imperium such a powerhouse, its not Titans, remove them from the game and Imperium will adapt to the next best alternative. The thing our enermies lack right now is the very core of a stable collective, too many people holding on to power to truly unify into the imperium counter force that is required in the game right now.  Until that changes, the game is going to remain stale in null-sec for the time being.
---
mmmkay ...
---
Yea you're right, everyone you farmed to near death after the war joined us or moved south.
---
You reap what you sow.
---
2 Nestors 1 C5.
---
FTFY
---
I guess everybody's forgotten Ravens already. That was a few months ago "OMG THIS IS GOING TO KILL THE GAME" doctrine.
---
I saw that in the Invasion patch notes:
---
&gt; Fixed issue preventing HIC Scram from preventing Micro Jump Field warps
---
Does this mean a Command Destroyer fitted with a MJFG or battleship/battlecruiser/dst fitted with a MJD can spool even while being pointed by a hic infiniscram?
---
The two don't have much to do with each other. Cap fights will be cap fights. Sub cap fights will be sub cap fights. You see far more of the latter than the former. That hasn't changed, isn't likely going to change.
---
The day they introduce premium ammo is the day I order an actual torch and pitchfork from amazon and buy a plane ticket to iceland.
---
2 leshaks and 1 Nestor could maybe do strongholds?
---
Except it is a shotgun. All that those kills have in common is that the people heavily underestimated the damage output and fucked up (including me).
---
But we had God and right on our side back then! /s
---
Super cool dude, was really helpfull for my time in their corps, know a lot about small gang pvp/Whs/Low sec/Solo pvp. Definetly a good pick. I voted for you Blood, You were my third pick :) Gl with you CSM run.   
---
\-Kaai
---
he uses racist people to lead his alliance and empowers known racist ( nidia ) to have power ... bad example in picking leaders and putting people in power.. dont care if its his real life friend dude is a well known racist on comms and in person. racism and trolling in a video game are 2 different things and nidia doesnt belong in eve and thats gobbins right hand man .
---
That was not always the case, however, and the name and concept dates from the pre-gold-for-credits era.
---
Sunday, I lost a Proteus in a level 4 mission to NPCs.
---
Most missions, my tank is beyond what is in pocket.  That one, full room aggro is more then my tank can handle.  Little bit cocky and little bit wife aggro equaled a 1 Bill ship loss.
---
The part that makes it even worse is I lost another Proteus about 2 weeks prior.  Same mission and pocket.  That one was due to being stuck on a rock's collision box that was significantly larger then the rock itself.
---
So 2 Bil in Protei and 7 days of training in 2 weeks, to NPCs.
---
Received 13 Mil in insurance for each, so I got that goin' for me, which is nice.
---
Honestly, the down under talk gave me the impression that they do care quite a bit to address player concerns, including FW/LS. They said straight up that they wanted to stop worrying about perfection and just start making decisions, which is a great attitude in my opinion.
---
I quit EVE in 2013, EVE is a better game today.
---
I would have provided crowbars for that  ...
---
Think it depends on the nature of your support ticket.  I have only done two in the past 3 years and both were black screen issues and both handled in a few days.  With evemail and email regarding the ticket explaining the action taken.
---
What was your ticket regarding?
---
I am not everybody nor have I denounced the use of Ravens, and is at least a sub cap doctrine.
---
goons op, pls nerf
---
Any tickets I've submitted have generally been answered within 12 hours max, usually a lot less. What kind of ticket was it?
---
Thats interesting! but 'showing an interest' in something doesn't mean you'll represent it well.
---
As a large Null Bloc candidate, part of Test/Goons who are going to have a huge representation on an CSM due to their monopoly on votes and seats. Perhaps you could have premoted a great candidate for this field like Stich K and supported diversity of opinion on the coming CSM council you hope to be part of?
---
idk, as worrying as this is for the future of the game, i cant help but smile seeing the bullies of eve get laid the fuck out
---
yes,when i was blown up in gas site  by unknown entity ticketted it. week later ticket closed as  solved.
---
&gt;"Looks like someone dropped a bunch of nails."   
---
those are Raganaroks
---
In before the support ticket was over a ban.
---
Large scale stuff was more balanced. Small scale stuff had more content generators because you could always camp somebody's undock, now you just eat a DD that can hit frigates. Citadels were aids.
---
Fozzie sov was a good concept for small stuff but it gets ruined by larger powers, and made worse by citadels. TBH on its own it wasn't bad.
---
What would you do to defend it if you had to do it?
---
It literally has changed and continues to get worse, is the point. I've been playing since 2006 (with breaks) and I can certainly see how this has changed in the game over time. There's a huge difference in how often you see people throwing supers/titans into subcap engagements compared to what it used to be.
---
You're can't be serious. Every subcap that enters delve while theta is home gets a dozen thirsty nerds trying to drop their capital-class vessel on subcaps and you're telling me "vro they don't mix, what are you talking about?"
---
Torvald Uruz lost one today on stream.
---
The Orthrus TD'd him and kited him well, while simply pounding one damage type into his adaptive hardener until it caused a hole in the others, swapped out his damage types and boom.
---
Not a healthy alliance by far but I liked it for learning solo/smallgang. Lots of content, and if you got decent at certain roles, you were one of the best--so there was immediate feedback and you could pretty easily see the difference you make. For me that role was tackle and I absolutely learned to kick ass in a Slasher.
---
Large amount of terminal krabbers, attracts large amount of content.
---
It's why I've escaped to wormholes. Certainly not cap-immune but lots more subcap stuff.
---
Yeah that's an accurate assessment of them at times, but I always feel like people forget how apocalypiticaly big N3 was as a coalition and how it held it's ground. 256 man Carrier fleets anywhere in the game in an hour back in the slowcat era was fucking terrifyng.
---
Sadly I live in the UK and am a poor student so I take what I can get - No idea what strain ATM, but it's a decent enough indica weighted hybrid.
---
Nope. Nestor requires cap transfers, but sticking cap transfers on the leshaks makes the nestor barely tank c5 sites. 
---
You'd have to get super sweaty and refit straight reps on your leshaks when the nestor gets hit, but at that point just get 3 leshaks.
---
Honestly just get leshaks
---
Yup. That's Hilmar talking tho so I would ake about 3 steps away before actually giving credit, but for Hilmar to talk about it and then several others CSM members plus the fact it's like HS a long standing issue that need rework than is most likely going to be brought again and again ... There is hope and dreams to have. They might be crushed but hey, at least they will be at the highest this time.
---
What if it has nothing to do with being against pride month or the LGBTQ community, it‚Äôs the simple fact that Eve is a spaceship game that doesn‚Äôt have the slightest thing to do with your sexuality?
---
You can shoot anyone and everyone, you can build, mine, rat, and do anything else in this game without ever bringing your own sexuality into it. 
---
That‚Äôs my problem with bringing pride month into Eve. What if we don‚Äôt have to bring sexuality into everything? 
---
What if I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your sexuality because you‚Äôre just space pixels in a space pixel game where sexuality doesn‚Äôt even exist.
---
Maybe there are things in life that you can do without having to inform everyone about your sexuality because no one gives a fuck and they are going to shoot your space pixels regardless of your sexual orientation.
---
But all of a sudden I‚Äôm a homophobe because idgaf about people‚Äôs sexual orientation.
---
Very well played in game and very well done video. Worth the watch.
---
while it is correct what you are saying shouldn¬¥t we have no cap fights? There should only be subcap fights and fights which involve subcaps and caps somewhat equally? Also isn¬¥t the current state of Eve warfare subcaps are for fun, not really important stuff or when you do not want to commit. But if you want to win you bring caps.
---
&gt;Horde started as a nomadic group
---
This is laughably incorrect - Horde has been , and always will be, a resource for supplying NCPL with subcap meat shields. If they were nomadic it was because NCPL was moving an offensive front.
---
It's not 'lol' it's death of a game.
---
Lemme get this straight. Your argument is that CCP is artificially inflating numbers by systematically enacting changes like rorquals, injectors, and events in order to get people to create accounts, log in, and generate revenue. How devious! How dastardly! Those _monsters_ had the _audacity_ to make a bunch of changes over the long term that have lead to sustained growth and increased revenue!
---
 What you claimed earlier was that CCP was goosing the numbers with this event to hit their contract targets.  Now you're moving the goalposts to claim that ccps long term strategy is somehow to trick PA by actually fucking growing. You're a moron. Turn off the computer and head to a learning annex, maybe they can put you in some remedial classes so that you can rejoin society in some limited capacity.
---
TVs and Cellphones were too at one point, but over time the rarity fades.
---
Then you‚Äôll cry about Goons bringing too many battleships.
---
Doubtful imo. Cynojammers give the defender the ability to preposition caps and the attacker has to gate. I imagine we'll go around.
---
Gating into hostiles is too costly for anyone to do atm. Especially when one can drop/preposition caps and the other cannot.

---
He repeatedly emphasises that CSM needs to form a consensus within themselves and provide a consensus view to CCP. 
---
He also is correct in saying CCP often does not realises the butterfly effects of changes they make which can be somewhat mitigated or better understood with a consensus view from CSM.
---
His point is you‚Äôre not special no matter how hard you try to announce to the world that you are.
---
The large majority of common people grasp the concept that the world is a diverse place and people from all over the world play Eve, this by default making Eve a diverse game with people from thousands of different walks of life. And the majority of those common people understand this and thus play the game indiscriminately without care for anyone‚Äôs background because well the one thing every single one of us has in common is we like playing internet spaceships and that‚Äôs exactly what we are here to do(well and talk about internet spaceships) regardless of sexual orientation, race, religion, belief, whatever.
---
AAR  for me losing one of those ikis (https://zkillboard.com/kill/77218874/) . The iki is a very slow ship even with a well rolled deadspace mwd so obviously kiting is a worry. When I went into the arena and saw an orthus I popped overclocker to help bridge the gap in speed. I planned to just wait till he made a piloting mistake on one of the circle edges and cut him off till he got into web range. Problem is that I had a single rep (a good deadspace aby rep) which is good in an iki v iki fight but bad vs other ships with high base dps. He broke my tank far far easier than I expected and I died just as I manged to start cornering him. If I had used my brain at the start of the fight and used hardshell instead of overclocker I probably could have tanked him, catching him would have been possible without the extra speed. He let me keep my high grade pod which was like 4-5bil, alot of aby pvpers seem to not kill pods which I also plan to start doing to spread the good will.
---
Like ascee is recruiting from jita local, test is always recruting and NCPL will accept any one with fax.
---
They were wiped off the face of the earth.
---
‚ÄúNever mind forget them they were destroyed in Delve bc they were gating - WELL DO IT LIVE‚Äù
---
were there any titians lost? a keepstar should be powerful enough to take some down with it...
---
They should add skins for drones so if you launch drones but someone else has drones too whoever has the cutest skin will have all the drones fall in love and the two flights will combine into one fighter. But the pilots are happy and don't do their way
---
Did you not see the other 2000 dudes? You have no imagination.
---
Those outside of Goonswarm probably know him by another name, oodell.
---
How long did it take to kill the keepstar with all those titans?
---
Can you tell us exactly what the ticket was about? It would be easier to answer your questions if you do so.
---
&gt;That Escalated Quickly
---
**That Escalated Quickly**

"you're"

Geminate by Labor Day
---
I thought they staged their fleets out of Saranen?
---
:)
---
Then we both win! I get to make isk, you get to gank me.
---
You can transfer them to horde alts and make 5-10bil profit.  With guarded regional gates and not worrying about LSSP now is the time to move north and make good profit.
---
You forgot asset safety.
---
&gt; Should we give ore anoms scarcity or even longer cooldowns so you can't afk 30k toons in a small area with complete safety?
---
The farms and fields approach falls flat in a pvp game when a few dozen fields provide enough for so many players.
---
&gt; Instead of rewarding players for utilizing under used space everything they do seems to benefit n+1000 within jump range of a keepstar.
---
Guess which CSM members pushed for mission agents in sov stations. So all the ratting could be done in a handful of systems.
---
It comes down to the iki pilot tbh, people like gustav have killed the same orthus pilot in basically the same fit ( https://zkillboard.com/kill/77198428/ ) and I know I may have been able to if I had made different choices.
---
Seemed legit though.
---
what the fuck man
---
Make baseball 2 without the pitcher, 3rd plate coach, and catchers mit.
---
That orthus had around 1100 dps heated with drugs using kinetic ammo (the ikis weakspot even with the reactive hardener)
---
Thank you very much for the AAR.. seems like a well piloted Orthrus and he exploit the resist hole and your mistakes.
---
I exclusively fly super blingy HG implant ships, and no I'm not shit. While yes I do pay for my stuff with in-game isk, not everyone who plays like me does. I've played with a handful who spend more money than they honestly should on ISK, and they're not bad at the game either.
---
&gt;Feels like a Cerberus could do better

less volley

less speed

less agility

NCAssetSafety but only for 21 days.
---
AAR soon(tm)
---
B-R was actually caused by a bug but otherwise yea
---
I've always honestly thought of this. Any ship or structure for that matter exploding has a certain shock wave and "should" deal damage to things in a certain blast radius based on the ship/structure size. I mean things like shrapnel is just like projectile ammo essentially....  
---
Would definitely be neat to see that dynamic added in. Almost like a farewell screw you, have some damage from blowing my shit up from my shit blowing up and showering your ship in the pieces of mine.
---
i agree wtf indeed.
---
~~DINOSAUR~~ BEE XD
---
&gt; Have you played in the last years?
---
PL/NC pretty much made it impossible not to have a huge titan fleet and expect to compete many years ago. Looks like the rest of Eve caught on and caught up.
---
When is your Providence morale invasion slated to happen?
---
Wartime sucks because all the front door pvp fun of BWF and O-V is not as available.  Normally Horde is a great place for pvp, that's why all the streamers and half of eve comes to Geminate for the good fights and Horde loves fighting.  It's only 10 mins in a hyper rifter back to BWF.  Check zkillboard or dotlan, and you'll see there is pvp opportunities out there.  Also during this content starved war there are some vets stepping up to create content where they can or help teach the new beans.  Long story short, we still like to fight and if you are looking to learn there is still many in horde willing to help.
---
&gt;Bonus: A legible Neocom bar

Honestly this one hurts the most. I remember when people said that the icons were just placeholders :/
---
Armor or shield fleets?
---
eww
---
Isboxer
---
I was banned for Alpha Abuse/Macro Use which I assume means they think I was botting.
---
Luckily I am able to play EVE on a side monitor at my office (Pretty nice right?) so I pretty regularly rat/mine while I work.
---
Peripheral vision on local means I am generally not caught by anyone trying to gank me so I was probably reported by people who tried and failed.
---
The real unfortunate thing is that if they look at the logs I would hope it would be pretty easy to see that I was not botting as I often talked to the people that tried to gank me (Usually to see if they had got any good kills that day) and would be often be managing other things (industry/market) while ratting/mining.
---
And yes I know I am going to get a wall of "Proof or you are hacking" but that is kinda hard to provide when those logs and such are on the server...
---
I do not know which side you fight for but I assure you that this is wrong. 
---
10 new beans in ewar means that 30 of the hacs on field can not hit your fleet. 16 jack daws is the different between losing some small ships to a bombing run or 90% of the fleet in armour ready to be moped up.
---
Sure you do not press f1 and get a big number, but the fleet is running to its full potential with you there.
---
In after the support ticket was over a ban.
---
What "fleets"? You speak of the occasianal Fozzy-Claws or the welpcanes? At least PanFam fielded Supers &amp; Titans already in a fight of this war, so they lead you in this at least ...
---
Bridger jumped instead of bridging. Classic content generation!
---
Dude, Pride is not about feeling "special" its about feeling some sort of sense of self-worth for a lot of people after losing friends, family, etc. becauase of their sexual orientation. I know its popular for dudebros to shit on Pride/Pride Month because of "ShOvInG TheIR SexUaLItY In my fACe" but there is still plenty of homophobia/transphobia among eve players. Ive been in corps where players were openly shitty about other peoples sexuality and ones where it was welcoming and my CEO was gay (which was pretty cool for an uncertain youth like me at the time).
---
If you want an example of how shitty eve players are, i can give you a thread where a transgender player was raked over the coals by people for wanting a Corp with other transgender people, and thoseposters used the same line of reasoning as you and StainGuy do. Never mind the fact that out of game and in Eve, transgender people/players have been especially maligned, but it was extremely shitty to see fellow players be that toxic
---
So you are trying to karma whore on something you aren‚Äôt even participating in??

Not that much of aar needed.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Navy vexor

red death!
---
Not really.
---
Unless it has been corrected, I remembered the time that I used to save the settings files manually (2010/2012), so I can restore a perfected arranged game at any time necessary...
---
...but I couldn't use said copy for more than 6 weeks (more or less). It was like there was a TIMEOUT in EVE regarding the settings. So, if I tried to use them but they were too "old", the game rewrited said files and started with default settings even after multiple tries, regardless of if there was an expansion or not who could justify it.
---
More strange, if I use said copy and it was still godd, if said "timeout" arrive few days after, SOME settings could be reset after a login.
---
Unless they are the original ones, setting files die after an unknown amount of time and reason, but I suspect a (very) poorly designed system.
---
I hope that one day, they will give us settings files in XML/JSON, so that we can save something who can be repaired manually. It is not like they can't do that, overview files are in a human-readable format.

One of us, one of us, one of us.

Very good!

Oh look totally irrelevant and useless words. Do you actually have a point? Because you are not actually saying anything.
---
A player who pays IRL money could
---
-have a better ship than an opponent. In a 1v1 fight, a competent loki should almost never lose to a competent frigate.
---
-have a better fit than an opponent. A person that pays IRL money would have more isk, and could afford better fits or good abyssal stuff that the other player wouldn't have access to.
---
-have more practice than their opponent. A person who buys plex would be able to spend all their time practicing PVP instead of grinding for isk, and if they replace all their losses with plex, they can have a lot more practice than someone who doesn't buy plex.
---
You're saying it like this was all positive things.
---
Ishtars are cool too Dave, I know you hate New things :P
---
MBC formed for one conflict and disbanded.
---
Naglfar
---
wow very cool!

That was the strategy from the start, take the region, don't make waves and don't get involved. The ones that can take it have better space, and those that want it, can't.
---
Ouchies
---
Oh yeah and he could loose his better stuff against another guy. Also you dont engage a loki with shit ship. Or you can be more :D or bait him :p flying expensive ship / fit doesnt stay long if you take risk. Look at the number of cap (for example titan) that die each week.
---
Make friends and not be cunts. Then you might not get the big goon dick after years if proclaiming superiority.
---
Or try winning an ihub timer so you can jam systems. They failed to undock... lost fozzie sov...lost the keepstar....and soon maybe even lose reddit
---
And n3 had more than half  of nullsec sov and more than half the members too for 5+ years
---
In what fairy world do you live where goons have not had to deal with all of these issues? You act as if we never leave Delve, and that Sigs and Squads aren't a thing.
---
Just fucking LOL at the off-timezone structures comment.
---
I'm sad to say, but CCP doesn't normally answer to tickets from players who are permanently banned. They do only in very special situations like: 
---
\- Player was mistakenly banned and it is obvious that it is so
---
\- Player is extremely popular and calls CCP out on it's mistake  
---
\- Lots of people start crying in reddit and/or forums about a ban
---
After these situations CCP has to revisit it, either unbanning a person or keeping the ban as it is forcing them to be more transparent about the ban and explain in more detail what happened  
---
The people I play eve the most have been wrongly banned from eve, some of them multiple times even, but they were compensated after CCP revisited the case.   
---
I hope they look into your case in more detail and make sure you are unbanned, however there is no guarantee of this.  
---
Good luck!
---
That would be rusty nails

Blame ccp. We told them rorqs were broke. We told them injectors were dumb. We told them fozzie sov was shit. So this is their game now until a bunch of people quit. Then the little guy really wins.... back to 50 man fleet being a blob

Eve 2019, N+1 titan fleets
---
Look I‚Äôve never said there aren‚Äôt hateful Eve players. It‚Äôs the same thing when I talk to people in real life about this stuff. Yes, racist, sexist, hateful people exist in this world and there‚Äôs not much you can do to change their twisted way of thinking. The best you can do is recognize it for what it is and avoid it. Most of those people are too dumb to be aware of their own thought process so it‚Äôs neat to just avoid them. I used the words ‚Äúthe large majority of common people‚Äù for a reason. Yes there are outliers and assholes but the large majority of Eve players aren‚Äôt them and the best thing you can do is just move on from the ones that are. 
---
It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre LGBTQ and it‚Äôs fine if you have friends you play with and a community you thrive in. That doesn‚Äôt mean that Stain Guy or myself are wrong in saying I‚Äôm not a discriminant asshole, I‚Äôll respect you as a person but your sexual orientation still has nothing to do with internet spaceships, I don‚Äôt hang out on discord or any coms like that so really your sexual orientation is completely irrelevant to how I play Eve online and I don‚Äôt need to know about it.
---
Why can‚Äôt we just see it for what it is and understand there are 0 sexual interactions in Eve, why does it have to be included in everything even if they‚Äôre completely unrelated?
---
Titans weren't even in use until these kills. They lost the war long ago leading up to it. Fabian victory though etcetc
---
Interesting, so you are saying having friends saves structures.  Good to know.
---
Unrelated; wtb friends (provides epic tummy rubs).

5 minutes? Why he didn't safe log off?
---
How did you kill the autz m-o keepstar today Mr can't fight off timezone structures
---
Major conduits look different from the minor ones if the last mail is to be believed.
---
It was added not long ago to titan deaths, but the explosion radius was so large it basically applied zero meaningful damage to anything at all. Also, titans tend to die in already-server-melting circumstances, so adding the server load of calculating thousands of extra AoE damage instances that deal no meaningful damage was deemed not worth it and it was removed shortly after the UALX battle, where it caused major problems.
---
Rag jumped instead of bridge, woops.
---
If two people play eve for the same amount of time, the one who pays IRL money will spend less time krabbing, and therefore spend more time practicing pvp. Given equal time and equal natural skill, a player with money should win every fight against a player without money. 
---
Pay to win doesn't always mean money gives you an auto-win button. But if roughly equally skilled/dedicated players fight, and the one who paid almost always wins, that makes the game pay-to-win imo.
---
Just because someone who has spent hours reading guides, practicing pvp, and grinding to fund the PVP can beat a day 1 player who has money doesn't mean the game isn't pay-to-win.
---
Station games were kinda bad but what they replaced them with was far worse.
---
Titans had splash damage on death but they removed it for server performance reasons
---
So he pays money to do what he pleases in the game like you...and there's a problem?
---
What will they make once Super Titans become common?
---
Can we take a moment to appreciate that two keepstars have died in M-0ee8 :)
---
Thanks for the AAR! I used to fly Orthrus in the Abyss and would get a bunch of Vedmak kills I didn't deserve due to surprising burst, but have stopped since the Iki. Ololol is making me want to try again. üòÅ
---
Try undocking. You might get a different result
---
Ouch. You got schooled brah.
---
Not to worry. Four direct competitors are being created as we speak.
---
to be fair, faxes doesnt get on killboard unless dead or whoring
---
I remeber back in 2013 when NC and PL could instantly teleport their superfleet anywhere on the map and completely counter everything yes.
---
Rip this guy. His death has provided contents for both sides. These rare events are a good way for escalations. This is what we need
---
Sounds like you got his point
---
Dont worry ccp will just make an Uber Titian and those will be rare...
---
Core probes you can ignore, combat probes are required to scan down your ship. (Unless your in a scanned anom but you would have scanned that yourself)
---
That's actually super interesting. Thanks for the bit of info. I've only been around for less than a year at this point.
---
It sucks that they made it meaningless damage. I'm sorry but if I was in a Cruiser or something and a Carrier blew up 5km from me, I'd expect it to do some serious damage to my ship or at least produce an EMP blast that knocks out my navigation computer or targeting systems for a short period of time. 
---
As far as the melting server conditions, I can definitely understand that having been in tidi quite a few times in the large fights. I think it would add an interesting dynamic though regardless if they made it have actual meaningful damage or effects.
---
wow... more interessting would be a video about a carrier killing rats.
---
&gt;Watchlists being your greatest friend and greatest enemy
---
Aka, the last time hisec wars actually had engaging gameplay for attacker and defender instead of just camping around Jita. You could actually hunt someone instead of randomly shooting in the dark.
---
strawman detected
---
I was about to say. OP's right about a lot of stuff, but one thing I distinctly *don't* miss is a super fleet materializing from the other side of the game any time anyone else used capitals ever.
---
So I was correct, you got banned. And I posted before you stated as such, so yes, in before lol.
---
Because finding a way to surmount two Titans is TOTALLY the same as finding a way to surmount several thousand.

If bad players couldn't buy good ships, they'd still lose to good players. My point is that pay-to-win doesn't always mean you can buy an auto-win button. If a competent player can beat a good player by paying IRL money, that's a form of pay-to-win.
---
Anything you can buy IRL that allows you to win fights you would otherwise lose is a form of pay-to-win. Idiots losing fights they would have lost otherwise doesn't disprove that.
---
Do you seriously deny that there is no way to spend IRL money on eve that would let you win a fight you would have otherwise lost?

thats not really a true analogy though.  i have been playing this game for near 16 years yet i have a titan pilot that is only just over a month old as i extracted skills out my main an injected a new pilot
---

---
Ans then the game will actually die, because CCP will make less money and fire more people and then be consumed into a new studio by there new owners
---
Alpha abuse is not botting. Literally they caught you with an alpha logged in at same time as another account.
---
And today‚Äôs gameplay is any better? :^ )
---
Sounds like an offensive to me
---
I mean you can't *force* your members to krab for titans, people never seem to account for the fact that some people simply couldn't care less about three years of industrial buildup for a showdown in the north and would have rather (and indeed did) spend three years building titans. And before you pull the "well don't cry about it now then" maybe consider the fact that no one is!
---
The only way to save a keepstar is to have more of X so that the other team doesn't show up. That is proper game design...fuck skill, let's blue doughnut this shit.
---
Gallente was a mistake - change my mind.
---
Isn't it funny how we're always unstoppable, bad for the game and/or killing Eve right before we lose all our space and start over?
---
Thank you good sir!
---
Highly concentrated, like the salt in this post.
---
Its obvious they're building giant space scorpions to fight us.
---
That just further reinforces my my point. Do something about it. Get your friends to fight them. It seems hopeless so you give up botvh and expect someone to fix it for you? Lol no just do it yourself
---
Pretty sure the only decent fight of this war happened because stuff was timed to autz so yeah. Grand plan indeed.
---
Rattlesnake, thanathos, nyx
---
You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo, other paths that we might take.
---
well done. Im proud of your ability to undock, you are not new though so you receive no isk.
---
No one has ever underestimated the levels of autism that goons can collectively channel.
---
Provi have always brought good fights :)
---
Whatever shuts that fucking cyno beacon down that people misclick to, the better.
---
I've never fed it but I think it's super lame how much content eve has that revolves around misclicks. The less of it the better.
---
This just happened last night. We went on a fun frig roam with no set objective, just dick around and have fun. We accidentally steer into a staging system and promptly get shat on. Woke up this morning realizing I didn‚Äôt check pod üòÇ

---
Dude in a titan jumped instead of bridged. Test freaks out, dudes log in. FC asks titan pilot to light cyno. Followed shortly by FC screaming "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU NEED TO REFIT!?"
---
Titan died, and in classic Eve tradition, one man's stupidity becomes everyone else's fun. 
---
GF Frat, good start to the day.
---
true, but only 2 dead fauxes means that either very few fauxes showed up or they were able to out damage the reps.  I doubt they would be able to outdamage an actual wing of fleets fauxes enough to kill that rag so that means that very few showed up.
---
&gt;all builds must be buffer fit and brawl fit  no regen or active builds-
---
Is this for the theming or for balance reason? Same question for no prop/speed/nano rigs?
---
Thanks, hopefully a community manager will see this or something and I will get back in EVE.
---
It would really suck to have this be the end since I have played off and on since Apocrypha.
---
Would have much rather gone out in a giant isk wasting explosion haha
---
Clearly the 64-bit client was a ploy by the GSM working in cahoots with the art team to help our members with this war.
---
Now you understand the goon MO.
---
Lol I meant I was in after.  Guess I shouldn't try and be witty.
---
Then you know very little about the history of unions.
---
If this is gonna breath new life intro LS I'm all for gold ammo and premium ~~tanks~~ ships.
---
At least you eventually got over it though, eh.
---
shut up retard
---
we cyno'd in when the keepstar was at like 5% structure, the intention was to have the lance wave finish it off (which it did). not a lot of time for the keepstar itself to do much damage, though we did nearly kill one of our own.
---
frankly I'm surprised we didn't love half the titan fleet right then and there
---
Because in eve 2019, you don't need to be good to fly a titan.
---
Not common, but I say this twice last year
---
Eh indeed.
---
I've been out of null for 3 years and was winning Eve for 2 of that. And I won't argue they weren't fun fights. I jammed one of those archons.
---
Unlike the supercap blob sending fighters of old, a tactic favored by PL if I remember correctly, which was different because &lt;reasons&gt;
---
They're being a bit dramatic. Most of the WWB fights were subcap with relatively even numbers which the Imperium was quite bad at, even prior to alienating old CO2.
---
Once blood was in the water anyone on the fence about joining dogpiled in, along with CO2 turning sides.
---
Dominix
---
&gt;  Keepstar?? yea...unless you are a big null entity or their pet, good luck owning one. 
---
it is genuinely surprising to me that the amamake and camal keeps have lived as long as they have
---
I mean nothing was stopping PL doing the same?
---
Eh, this isn't super related to that. FRT was always going to be an enemy, given how they were our unfriendly content neighbor.
---
~30 trill isk. can one shot structures
---
This is for t4 gammas. 
---
Mods are 10mn Fed navy AB, 4 large navy shield extenders, and a t2 adaptive hardener. Highs are RLML and drone link. Lows are DDAs. Rigs are the ones that make your shield regen faster. Drones are all t2
---
valkyries.
---
That happened to titans before so ya, maybe.
---
CCP removing the constraints around skilling was a massive mistake for the health of the game, great for their short-term bottom line.
---
Talk about a stab through the heart alright.
---
EVE is by now old enough for the first inter-generational conflicts to arise. This would be a prime example.
---
‚ÄúYou can bring absolutely anybody home as your boyfriend, honey. But if he‚Äôs with the Goons your mother and I don‚Äôt want to know your name anymore!"
---
Ah now it makes sense. Thank you.
---
It doesn't really make of a difference in low sec beyond the "being able to safe up in systems that previously had no stations" thing that applies to null as well. Like half of Snuff still lives in a station because they can't be bothered to move all their stuff.
---
I could take a few seconds of that spastic camera movement.
---
I wish horde would stop camping the Oijanen gate in BWF-ZZ so that evil goonies such as myself can get into geminate.
---
You Sir, deserve an upvote
---
You can kick obvious bots?
---
You are right and I acknowledged my mistake. I was very defensive, which I now understand and am trying to work on it. Thanks.
---
Lmao meltdown
---
How did you save your pod? Doesn't it die anyways after the timer runs out? No?
---
Love injectors
---
Imagine using reasonable arguments, what a fucking nerd amirite.
---
Can you link your killmail, if you don't mind.
---
I'm not at home atm, will when I can.
---
Damn, it does at least look a bit more organized than it used to.
---
the vast majority of cap fights are literal escalations from sub cap fights, how can one say something so dumb while playing the game for so long is astonishing. No wonder you are a titan main
---
Its a great new invention, only available to Goons.
---
Its called a fucking Alarm Clock.
---
I'm in 100% agreement.
---
I think it would have been ok if there was a very low cap. Not "diminishing returns". But "Once you hit 10 mil injectors no longer work". It would help a new player get up to speed (as well as new alts) but not be game breakingly powerful. Day 1 supers should have never been a thing.
---
Lol nope moment for sure. 
---
What do you mean by staging system?
---
Baring any major life changes, i plan on running again now that i know how the process works. Next time I will be more visible / vocal in the early stages. Thanks for the encouragement
---
its literally impossible to defend a keep in a titan brawl you brainlet, it takes just a few titans to keep the structure paused
---
Don't worry, the defense fleet is here on reddit, crying about how unfair EVE is now.
---
Losing your POS potentially meant losing all your shit (no asset safety).
---
You had to haul all of your shit to empire rather than deposit it in an enemy structure and fedex it there.
---
Destructible structures could be destroyed after a single timer in 1-2 days.
---
Media Player
---
Is it though? Or are you just making things up?
---
Alpha abuse is logging in with an alpha and an omega from the same machine. Were you using an alpha to scout for you?
---
I assumed the "Macro Use" part meant botting, my bad.  Can't say I am super familiar with the banned messages...
---
I'm sure seeing a lot of cryposting from northern members considering that "no one is crying" about it.
---
Oh no! Were you just flustered and didn't realize it? Multiboxing is a whole other level lol.
---
 
---
&gt;Titan doomsdays actually deleted capitals with one button
---
Most capitals were DD tank fit, so no you couldnt just delete them with 1 button, you had to shoot them some with guns first.
---
&gt;No faxes in wormhole space
---
You still had triage carriers in wormholes
---
&gt;**Bonus:** A legible Neocom bar
---
Yeah, i miss the old one with colors and all
---
Ahh, gotcha lol
---
I used to use a sentry/cruise rattlesnake for a change.  Slightly more active gameplay, more isk on the line if you get dropped. Moderately shiny, so you might actually get dropped on.  Otherwise Machariel (same idea), RR Domis (the budget version), or a Marauder (if you've got real balls and a fat wallet).
---
I can't think of a better reason to talk to me :p
---
Tell me the insurance payout of a dread - ok, now the payout of a titan.
---
Seems like a few people here have mistakenly sat outside a station only to get picked off. 
---
Good lessons to learn from here lol!
---
&gt;Most capitals were DD tank fit
---
Unless you knew what was about to doomsday, a 3 million damage button 99% of the time deleted you
---
Unavailable in wormholes_btw
---
Who's forcing you to fly in N+1 monkey fleets in nullsec? Only yourself.
---
Only available on the epic store. Bonuspoints for also not having a working chat system
---
Unfortunately. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the right things I guess. I‚Äôm sure I was too focused on my alt sitting on the static and just not paying mind to rats pointing me. To be fair I am new to C5 sites and maybe had only 10 at most under my belt at the time of the incident. I will never make that mistake again though lol.
---
So you got an injected titan pilot and you might be a spodbrain so it could be true for you too
---
Not for the better. Ive seen this bullshit for 10 years.
---
It's all subjective. Some people like to grind because they feel like they're destroying things others have spent time building, some people want to feel like they're part of something ground (game????) breaking or defining, like sitting amongst the largest group of titans ever assembled, some people couldn't care less and just want to pvp.
---
3 of the 4 Invasions despawned as of now.
---
triple monitors setup would be better!
---
I still think injectors on their own would not be such a huge issue. But combined with capitals online...
---
 FÕ¢Ã´ÃôÃ£ÕéÃ≠
---
Yeah, but now we got skins, lots of skins for sale! Did I mention skins?!?
---
after the recent fax nerf its VERY easy to break fax reps. 100 dreads outdps like 200 faxes.
---
Part of me misses those. Mostly because they were broke as shit and I had only gotten my super at the tail end of it.
---
When did this happen to you?
---
Mindblown
---
Becoming Goons doesn't solve the problem.
---
The first implementation of jump fatigue was also just as cancerous tbh.
---
So you believe that one's choices should all be beyond scrutiny and criticism?
---
As will your good looks, Bill. Time is as much a cruel mistress as it is a flat circle.
---
buy a nyx, jita poor, am i right
---
Just knowing that a group has 350 titans to drop means you need to be prepared to fight them. The only way to really fight N titans is with N+1 titans.
---
Pretty good gameplay.
---
&gt; Most capitals were DD tank fit, so no you couldnt just delete them with 1 button, you had to shoot them some with guns first.
---
How do you work that one out? A slowcat was 2.7m EHP and dreads were like 1.5-2.5m.
---
I'm so confused, are you arguing that Goons represent everyone?
---
113 BPM
---
Could you explain what happened with Serenity?
---
You can only activate the packs once per acct.  Time to start making alts!
---
Is your crew going to? sounds like your block is about to mass unsub over being deep dicked, what a shame.
---
well ccp did reduce the srp + they need to mine to build new once with hostiles in range and the grid goes to test. i would say its still in test favor
---
Honestly, if supers were jammable like they are today. Oh boy how much chaos would ensue for spider tanking super fleets
---
Once your ship dies the gate opens, if they choose not to kill the pod you can just burn out.
---
Gobbins is a good man who understands, or at least has access to understand, the issues with: large-scale nullsec campaigns, FC'ing, running a large corp/alliance, new player retention, quality of life issues for every aspect of the game, high-sec wars, and ship/cap balance.  
---
He's also well spoken and rational, in that he won't stick to his ~talking points~ if you can make a solid argument.  
---
Perfect for the CSM.
---
the csm we need
---
It was their capital system so there was about 100 in local
---
This is a visual form of spodbrain, incredible.
---
A : "They". Most of the Eve Universe was there too, remember them ?
---
B : Because not bullying people is fine. Also people were tired of it.
---
C : Why would we ? Ultimately this war was only a matter of time before everything was burned. Why would we bore ourselves doing it ? We don't have the manpower necessary to replace people going into burnout undocking every 15 sec because goons can field fleets whenever they want, but we have to rest sometimes eh ?
---
Pew pew!
---
I sometimes have an alpha running on my home server to collect chat logs (traffic/statistical analysis is fun) but never on the same comp as my omegas.
---
Is that a faux pas?  I thought it was fine as long as they weren't on the same machine.
---
Hey TAPI, wanna be friends and fight goons?
---
What M-O Keepstar?
---
To be fair GOTG drove themselves into goons arms. Sort is only looking to keep his alliance living, even if it means backstabbing everyone.
---
Can people stop blaming NCPL because they remained neutral when Gobbins was mad at GOTG and went there ?
---
Why do we need a candidate to point out the issues with FW? CCP dont want to talk to us?
---
&gt; Uber Titian
---
prepare for galaxy taxi
---
Essentially its just one alliance so peace and little content, but good for krabbers.
---
USA : Damn Andorra surrendered, it they don't want to fight they should leave this planet.
---
Random guy : You do realise they have the smallest army in the world, right ?
---
USA : Yes but they could have tried to defend themselves idk
---
Lol yup, insidious was fighting us ln in Oicx. Good fella.
---
The fact that people would dismiss the agency without looking at it closely enough to realize that there's that check box is probably a bigger problem than the agency itself.
---
The whole point is that the people who need it most won't know how to open it. If you don't need it feel free to keep it closed. But I would recommend paying better attention. It wasn't like they hid it.
---
That's what I thought just wanted to make sure. Thanks.
---
u should just put '' hes gonna help balance the GSM so panfam has more csm members '' ...
---
Till I learned PanFam with 800 titans are a small army.
---
Quite an accusation.
---
Ironically goons are creating more content in Delve than they are in the north.
---
The glorious age of roaming to someone's staging and having a good old fashioned subcap skirmish are over.  üòî
---
Neither asked me for their support... Never heard of either one... Im very active in the warzone and I know everyone so how could this be? There is a group of people that hang out in some discords and stream etc that are very disconnected from the game they think they know so well. Reminds me of you last year
---
facts any old school horde members know the cancer of a player he is . His racist comments and insane opinions on newbeans were the reason countless people left horde. These are facts no accusations..
---
This is an amazingly garbage post. You're supposed to post edited videos of interesting content, not 1+ hour long unedited videos of something even more boring than fucking mining.
---
Well it's failing. Just remove the damage cap and let things get roffle shot. Too many Garbo citadels in Eve as it is
---
Well, the other potential problem even if the servers weren't an issue is you're creating a snowball effect.  Eve already has enough problems with N+1 leading to total wipeouts without adding a cascading damage effect that makes each subsequent kill easier for the side that's already winning.
---
i just close and reopen the fitting window and it reaets for me
---
Remained nuetral...NCPL farmes GOTG ratter and miners just as much as Goon Sigs. Give me a break.
---
i joined goons so i could '' get with the times '' and got me a titan and then left goons lol.. thanks to delve for the infinite ratting safety and ability to buy my first titan !
---
Facts, your comment has none.
---
Probably Jeff Bezos.
---
Looks awesome
---
Bluemellon, Casper24, mittani. Idk.
---
not everyone in horde is a newbean. Horde has been around for a long time.. do your homework and hold people accountable for their in game actions. Stop using your bias'd horde opinion as a newbean to ignore the fact Nidia is a racist and cancer of a human being.
---
Please do so and hook me up
---
Because the vast majority of people who enjoy that type of gameplay want it to be in the safest space possible, resulting in joining Goons or TAPI who are both \~not blue\~.
---
What‚Äôs the mistake in your opinion? That they make ratting too easy?
---
Ironically the salt that flows from every one of your posts is more content than I could ever produce if I tried.
---
0 content is a pretty low bar.
---
The EULA says that you as a person can only have one unlicensed account running at a time or as many accounts as you have purchased licenses for. Licenses in this case being your subscription.
---
Which CCP shouldn't enable in the almost absolute terms that are possible right now. Yes krabbers shouldn't be losing a ship every time they go out, but also they shouldn't be (almost) absolutely safe. I think the way the game is set up the latter has become too manifest in Delve.
---
Yes
---
Horde is a third the size of goons and the member count is filled out by much lower-SP players.  But you know that.
---
Probably Mansa Musa.
---
interesting, did not know that the nerf bat hit so hard.  I was till under the impression that a decent faux wing could outrep a dreadbomb.
---
Setting up an alliance but me being such a lazy arse didn‚Äôt bother to read up on all the details of how one actually works. Alliance automatically disbanded a month later for not paying a bill that was due (didn‚Äôt click on ‚Äòauto-pay bills‚Äô option).
---
&gt;I believe it was described to me by one ex-NC pilot that if an "idiot" got caught in his rorqual or super in NC he would be told to die like a man and probably be purged if it consistently happens
---
This literally still happens in Goons. 
---
Unlike NC, Goons have the sheer numbers logged in at all times to defend against pretty much any attack, NC do try defend krabbers but lack the same ability to flash form the required numbers.
---
Yup - a patch went in this morning that included changes and a few strings related to the next stage, it‚Äôs coming
---
Not really sure, but sounds like it could be considered an abuse... have you read the EULA?
---
And Macro using is literally using a macro to give commands. You should seriously read the rules mate, just to clear things up yourself, CCP probably won't tell you something they consider you should know already.
---
I just want the damn multicoloured Neocom back. If nothing else give me the option to get rid of this godawful monochrome shite
---
i think it means that was something that was possible previously, but it was unintended, and is now fixed
---
Meh who cares
---
I cared nothing for it before patch and i care nothing for it now.  The window was open for so little time before i closed it that i never noticed the button until like day four.
---
As for the agency itself i think many see it as wasted resources on CCPs part (i know i do).  Why fix any of the multitude of longstanding bugs or balance issues when they can keep remaking the agency over and over right?
---
&gt; faux
---
please stop it
---
b-but PL killed my dread 3 mids from amamake while I tried to reinforce a tower solo for 20 minutes!!!
---
Now I know this is crazy, but hear me out. Shield Vexor.
---
Good fun has been had
---
WARNING:
---
I did as OP said and then for unknown reason stopped being spoon fed content! Don't do this if you are the average eve player or you might not find anything to do in the game anymore!
---
fitting 5mn mwd on cruiser  
---
although i had to spend the majority of the roam crippled, i was able to limp towards lowsec to mount a life-size prop mod and rejoin the fleet
---
I have no biased opinion. Just curious whether you have anything to back up what you're saying or not. 
---
If you do, I'm curious to see it. Otherwise, this reeks of shitty opsec propaganda.

I miss the days of being a casino banker, r64 free moon goo, dropping titans with impunity on weak alliances and asking them why they don't fight back. Wait, those are all bad things that only PL did, nevermind, carry on.
---
I occasionally meet up with my space friends for beer.  I think that's the real worth I've found in this game.
---
Man... wtf...
---
TEST was backstabbed more than one time. that is why TEST is not allying with panfam, for like every again. Period.
---
Atm Test is not really allied with the imperium anymore. It's just that we are the enemy of their enemy and vice versa. You are right, TEST is not the victim anymore. But you are halucinating if that is what you think TEST said for a good year now...
---
I guess I read what was at ([https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/213020969-Alpha-and-Omega-Clone](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/213020969-Alpha-and-Omega-Clone)) which reads:
---
    Multiple Omega accounts may be logged in at one time, as long as no Alpha account is actively logged into on the same computer.
---
And not the EULA ([https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/eve-eula-en/](https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/eve-eula-en/) ) section that is looser:
---
    You may establish more than one Account for each copy of the Software licensed. You are however not allowed to play EVE by using more than one Account at the same time, unless you pay a subscription fee for each of the Accounts you intend to use for that purpose.
---
Unfortunate since I guess the EULA would cover my case.
---
Ichooseyou is probably up there
---
Okay but then they have to re-enable manual structure repair.
---
Worked with Jeff on his Medina property quite a few times. The guy definitely knows how to party. No expense spared.

why would you call it a fax?

Only 30 tril isk and you can become your alliances structure bashing bitch... what a deal!

Si se√±or
---
This was good content. Happy little accidents.
---
People really needs a PSA about that clearly visible check box?
---
wtf wait ugh
---
because every time you say faux I hear jin taan's voice in my head. don't do that to me.
---
Noone really cares at this point, but probably some stupidly named alt without skills.
---
Smiles insidiously in Asakai. :)
---
I thought   you can't DD a keepstar because they have a dmg cap of 5k dps...
---
They are just useless
---
Amazing!
---
i apologize for your pain.  i ...  did  ...  not ... know.  
---
there will be no more talk of faxes.

I am definitely not the reeeeeechest!

This is the closest answer to your case I could find.
---
&gt; Spidertanked (super)carriers needed to die.
---
but they just would not die
---
&gt;they need to mine to build new once with hostiles in range and the grid goes to test.  
---
Both not relevant to financial value.
---
On a side note i hope you don't really think they don't have much more dreads already built.
---
\&gt;doxing yourself
---
Just use the "RICH" function on your Bloomberg terminal.
---
wasn't the point of the nerf to make titants able to die with lots of fax there

No-one knows....

I have a solution though.....

Everyone give me ISK then everyone will know when become the richest :)

oh glorious days of kv-2
---
People called in sick for this.
---
Not totally true. Good prober use 5 degree DSCAN first, if they find you possibly in a signal combat complex, they can really just use core probes to find you.
---
They do, but the real jammer battle is over the IHUBs that enable them to be placed, fighting over the jammer itself is pointless at this scale since you're never going to clear damage enough for the repair timer to run.  Goons can outform everyone to such an absurd degree that sooner or later they're going to form an incontestable blob for each one of those hubs, though. It might take them a couple tries, a good form for the north can beat a bad one for goons, but sooner or later they hit one that can't be contested by any northern form.  The only content in this war is the north occasionally trying to dunk an underformed or poorly placed fleet.
---
No, I want to play EvE lol
---
Mhh couldnt I change them both for a somehow noobi fighter or something?
---
um both have replacements, but ya still need to top up that cache, so yeah ya still need to build those. so the financially it still goes for TEST.
---
so wait, Test titan fail jumps to his death, test brings in a super fleet to spank some dreads...aaaand then nothing? where was frts super fleet? this was their home region, basically their TZ.
---
The first system for TEST is claimed in Detorid, and it started, like so many times... With a jump instead of a bridge.
---
nobody stored anything of consequence inside POSes outside of WH, lets keep the unseemly fan fiction to a minimum.
---
Oh sorry should have said so in the op.
---
Atm we run shield logi and we advise to use shield and missile fits, so mostly minmatar or caldari  Rides. More Info in the channel

Cheers
---
Before i make this post let me make something clear, i don't think gold ammo should be something ccp should ever touch, furthermore i think Matterall is absolutely unqualified to be on csm for a lot of reasons but his comments about monetization isn't one of them.
---
However, honestly his comments weren't that radical, it may sound radical to you if you are looking at eve and comparing to other games, but eve isn't world of tanks. 
---
If CCP were to introduce an item like that it would be expected that the item would also be sold by players via the market, like every single item that ccp sells for real money, can be sold via the market or contracts.
---
Also, would that really make eve pay 2 win? Or a better question, isn't Eve already pay 2 win?
---
I mean from the perspective of an alpha player when the alpha clones were initially released, eve was pay 2 win and had gold ammo, because alphas at the beginning couldn't use tech 2 guns therefore no tech 2 ammo.  (I think CCP later changed that so faction guns can now use tech 2 ammo but still faction guns are way too expensive to be fitted in frigates and its almost never worth it). People complained and CCP then changed the alpha system and allowed small and medium tech 2 guns, but no large guns, so alphas still don't have tech 2 ammo for large guns unless they are really rich (in which case why are they still alpha?) to be fitting battleships with faction large guns.
---
I mean, even the Omega Status itself could be argued (now that Eve is f2p) to be a form of "gold ammo" since alphas have their skills limited, compared to Omega, some skills that do impact the combat capabilities of frigates/destroyers/cruisers etc.. are locked to lower levels therefore alphas don't get the full power of their ships until they sub.
---
Of course, they can sub via ISK by buying Plex, but the same would be true for a mythical "gold ammo" that people are complaining about it here.
---
Of course, we, veteran eve players know that the differences aren't really that meaningful, and there are ways around it. And of course that a good alpha pilot can absolutely kick the ass of an Omega pilot if said Omega pilot doesn't know what he's doing or dealing with.
---
One good example that even myself would often show to people making the argument that eve was pay 2 win was Suitonia excellent videos where he goes around as a 20 day old alpha pilot in nullsec killing omega pilots with his kestrel, he even managed to kill ships that were worth more than 10x as much as his kestrel, so obviously eve isn't pay 2 win right?
---
Well lets make the same argument about world of Tanks, I don't play the stupid game, but lets say i go there buy a premium tank load myself up with gold ammo, and try and take on the players who, actually play the game, how do you think it end for me  being inexperienced in the game, not knowing what to do and what not to do? Last time i tried i literally got sniped from across the map by another tank, so i assume that the same thing would happen to me regardless if i had paid for a premium tank and its gold ammo or not.
---
Or lets take a simpler argument, how about a FPS game, that has a premium gun that you can buy or maybe unlock prior to anyone else, Battlefront had a gun that if you pre-order the game you would get it instantly, but if you didn't you had to spend hours upon hours of grinding to unlock, the gun was really good, you could drop people pretty quickly with that gun, which means that the people who had the gun on launch had a huge advantage over those that didn't, is that pay 2 win? use the same argument i made about world of tanks, imagine me being horrible aiming said gun, if i'm terrible with the gun or i don't know how to play the game at all, it doesn't matter how good the gun is i'm still going to lose.
---
I make this arguments because this are often the arguments people make (myself included) in defense of Eve online, but under closer examination these arguments just don't hold any water.
---
Battleships can be outplayed in lots of ways that caps and supers can't.  Deleting caps would result in a better game, not that its possible at this point.
---
Thanks for the response!  GL on your fleet!
---
The wait for a trig armor community continues...
---
These folks have a ton of isk and capitals . Roll out the taxes and force them to rep things
---
Oh yep, that's what I meant to ask. Thanks!
---
I was a bit confused by the use of the word warp there.
---
what if they arent bots
---
I am a vet newbro myself and just do it to bring people together. Each participant gets the same share of the cut and we are transparent about the ammount of loot and salvage we make
---
Well thank u. Ur always welcome :)
---
But Goons are the bullies now and have been for some time.
---
They haven't been the underdogs for years.
---
Then go and attack TEST? They seem like the obvious target since they are the second biggest coalition and they play the same empire building game as Goons
---
&gt;While we strive together in a common purpose with focus 
---
What is that common purpose? What is the 'opposition' even opposing?
---
&gt;But i'm curious, as a goon/imperium member, how do you see the future of the game?
---
They learn from it and come back stronger, like we did after the casino war. 
---
Then when they're stronger and we've rested on our laurels (and possibly gotten dangerously smug), the reformed northeastern bloc shows up and beat us. 
---
Then we learn from that and come back stronger and beat them.
---
Then they learn from that and come back stronger and beat us. 
---
And around and around we go in this amazing game. 
---
We're actually in a healthier state now in terms of titan balance in these ultra-large battles because faxes don't really have anything to do. Faxes only really mitigate gun damage so they're purely there to prevent a dreadbomb being effective. The titans themselves volley each other (wheres just a few years ago you had to shoot with guns AND DDs through constant capchain-cap-generating slowcat reps and supercarrier reps). 
---
The only two problems are: 
---
* Titans have limited damage types in their DDs (so if you're not big enough to have both tank types then your enemy can cheese-tank like a MF). 
---
* Its tough to coordinate DDs across allied fleets when you're not on the same comms setup and chat setup.
---
Exactly. Game turned into Animal Crossing.
---
This. Eve mogul pubby waved to a pan fam line member in local, showing their true allegiance.
---
Insufficient funds is also different from a chargeback though, OP just used the wrong terminology. 
---
Chargeback is where you call the card agency and tell them the purchase was fraudulent or deceptive, the vendor didn't fulfill their end of the agreement. 
---
As that's unlikely in CCP's case, bans for chargeback seem vaguely reasonable.
---
was it actually clearly visible to you?
---
I cant think of may windows in the game where you need to click something bottom right
---
that's a good one, is the little self-degrading things that make it even more humorous
---
If I recall correctly, CCP uses Wright voting. The "free riding" form of tactical voting described in the article you linked is only relevant if you believe that the other people supporting your first choice have a different second choice from you, and you are confident that enough people are supporting your first choice that they're guaranteed to make it in.
---
As an individual supporting any of the non-bloc candidates... you aren't in that position. Vote for who you want and if you fill out your entire list maybe one of them will get in.
---
As an individual following a bloc slate, feel free to reorder your list or pull people you like from it, I guess. Your one vote will still go to electing one candidate (or fractions to fractions). If it's candidates that you want as your representative more, then congratulations. You didn't actually tactically vote--you just disobeyed orders. If it's candidates that you want as your representative less, then I guess as long as the rep you liked better still gets on you've successfully tactically voted.
---
Obviously that's working.
---
Anyone hunting Asteros will have 5 points.
---
idc, I make my videos the way I want to, not bc they are "interesting" but more as a documentation for myself and others :P so stop shitting on other peoples style
---
What a interest gameplay (no)
---
It was. Log in, big agency windows coverin most of my screen, I quickly look around the edges, two things stand up, the cross to close it and an out of place blue "check"; read near it, uncheck, close window, life goes on as usual.
---
by default that checkbox is literally hidden behind the default notification button in the bottom right if you are not playing in fullscreen
---
good shit
---
Then they'll likely do something other than eat 23/7.
---
technically they should've had a head start on it.
---
Honestly the wasting resources argument might as well be a gateway drug argument.  The teams running changes like this that will push new player retention, are not the same people that understand balance.  The I know everything, just unfuck Titans and rorqs crowd is like 30% of the game crowd.  Kinda like 10% of any game crowd is aware of Reddit‚Äôs existence.  The game is 16 years old, constant polish is necessary.
---
Goons kinda have PIBCd the server in a way no one can stand against them they are currently the largest single
---
Group with the largest economy and largest super blob making the second super power of the Game stay docked and hide if NCPL can‚Äôt stand against them no one else will be able
---
To.   
---
Even ncpl wont be able to play catch up in regards to equal Titan and super numbers.
---
Goons have basically won eve
---
8 years ago: "Wouldn't it be fucking cool to have a whole fleet of titans?"
---
today: "Too many titans REEEEE"
---
Did you genuinely expect that the result wouldn't be like this in a sandbox mmo?
---
Whatever lies you have to tell yourself to keep your dignity, sure.
---
This is the dumbest thing you can say, you absolutely CAN have it both ways. Especially in a situation where you choose not to be the blob, and then choose not to fight the blob.
---
A new rag hull was contracted to the pilot from the titan cache before the new ihub was onlined, so..
---
Pretty sure there is one channel that runs them am not in eve atm but sth like public invasions or sth will check when home
---
I‚Äôd recommend the Heron. Cheap, and enough mids that anything not fit with a prop mod or an analyzer can fit scanning modules, like the rangefinding array (I think alphas can use the T1 version), to improve your scan strength.  If you‚Äôre more worried about being jumped, a magnate with four warp stabs in the lows is something I‚Äôve seen here and there.
---
They had slightly different game mechanics from what we have, so AOE DDs were more oppressive to subcap fleets (lances especially, apparently they had no AOE neut effect when fired). 
---
Didn't help that the losing side on the chinese server kept meeting the enemy head on as opposed to doing asymmetric warfare. And neither side quit their habit of having very tight anchor formations. Pipebombing and covops bombing was never as common on the chinese server so their FCs basically always had a tight formation flight that was very vulnerable to the oppressive game-mechanic state of the lances from titan squads. On TQ the losing side would've pipebombed and covops bombed the hell out of any fleet that came by with such tight formations but it never became a prevalent tactic on the chinese server for some reason (some tiny groups used it a lot I'm sure, but on TQ we ALL use covops bombs and pipebombing and chemo fleets given the opportunity to delete a whole fleet in ten seconds). 
---
Eventually one side ended up owning all of nullsec, basically. They never had fozziesov though, I think they pretty much had 2016 eve with some differences.
---
This picture is why I don't play anymore.
---
They probably saw the shiny loot that would drop from Hammerwerke and decided it was worth it helping take it than helping defend it.
---
The majority plays for like 2/3 months then realizes the missions get boring and quit.
---
 &gt; Granted, you can have enough warm bodies to cover all fairly well
---
It's significantly harder to cover all timezones when you have to put bodies across multiple regions. As it is now, you can load your defense fleets into one or two structures, and just login those who are active. Higher chance of "not enough" if you force jump clone timers.
---
CCP needs an expert in the room, so that when they ask a question that's more than just surface-level-obvious someone in the room can answer. Wormholes discovered this last time around when CCP proposed changing lurch HICs by removing their mass manipulation and nobody was in the room to tell them this would affect rolling math.
---
That must be a goons way. XDXD
---
1St on Goon thread!
---
Bear in mind the goon numbers on paper are quite inflated, I for instance, being just one player, have like 12 characters in goonswarm. 
---
but only 2 of them fly titans. :P
---
Dominix with sentries. Dual-rep Myrmidon with a mix of medium and heavy drones. Smartbomb Machariel. Rattlesnake with sentries and missiles. Gila with heavy drones and missiles.
---
&gt; Gallente was a mistake - change my mind.
---
Um, no? All four races have their pros and cons. That's the point. There's no single group that's better than the rest. The main selling point for Gallente, aside from drones, is the accessibility factor since they have more ships available for newbros/alphas.
---
Omega clone state üëç
---
I used the Imicus because it can fight back. Drones, bruh.
---
I think my most memorable one was choosing to engage PL's Dread fleet in Provi with our ever so slightly larger dread fleet, in the hope of saving a Soitoyo.
---
15 minutes later, NC. and Tri's supporting Dread fleets had jumped in and our entire cap fleet was dead. That was a big oof of a moment, lol.
---
It‚Äôs not applying them to accounts - it‚Äôs that GMG only allow one per sale, per pack, per customer
---
Can confirm Herons are great.
---
I'd lean away from a 4x stabs in a Magnate as I've had excellent luck popping 'em before they can actually warp away unless they are *fucking professional* at warping.
---
that will sure make awoxing structures fun
---
Counterpoint :
---
When the mission agent finder got moved into the agency window it got objectively harder to find them because the functionality fell off harder than medium AC without hull bonuses.
---
nope eve is an empire building real time strategy game
---
Only voted for BlazingBunny and ARROW.
---
whjat if they dont want to
---
They can lock and aggro a sub 2s ship you if the time they're into the tick + lock time + 2x latency is less than one total tick, as you need to have crossed over a tick of having a ship locked to be able to activate a module on it.
---
does it count as a loss for panfam if lenny bought it?
---
Sounds unironically fun
---
At least you think I look good
---
Not when they are the biggest fish in the sea.
---
Citadels fucked this game. Also this game went to shit when they buffed supercars and added HAW guns. I remember when battleship fleets were the best.
---
Heron fit with a burst jammer is the way to go. Panic button ftw. (Do NOT try this in hisec!)
---
Oh good point. Then again, didn't a lot of their wallets get isk deducted the dirty Casino War money Lenny handed them? Maybe CCP already collected that killmail for us.
---
Wouldve been boring without the titan jumping
---
ALL.
---
UN.
---
DEFENDED.
---
And our entire bulk is 100M SP+ veterans with 15 years of combat experience, rank with a fierce hatred and a cocaine habit? Anything you say about Horde can apply to us, too. Besides, skill injectors exist; your members having low skill point totals is a macroeconomic problem, not an existential problem. In short, tighten your fucking shot groups.
---
Wish I was there... but alas WORK!
---
coulda just tabbed out and played Apex tbh
---
Glass glass glass glass
---
The vast majority of fleets Goons have undocked have been subcaps.  Use of Titans doesn't really correlate with number of Titans (except in Delve).  I mean the ability to escalate to N+1 is the nub of it, but for the vast majority of timers Goons are in Eagles, Megas, Ferox, Harpy and so forth.
---
Youre missing the point entirely, gj. I am aware that test spodbrains are filthy rich, i was however just pointing out that frat didnt feed as much more as the numbers on the BR make people think at first.
---
Injectors themselves aren't terrible it's the fact you can, with enough investment, have a 1 day old character capable of doing literally anything you desire
---
Really, France?
---
We did not.
---
Tried to fleet-warp our small gang directly on top of an enemy small gang, warped myself (in a Hecate) instead.  Pointed, killed, that's all she wrote.
---
&gt; No fatigue which caused players to be more cautious to use ~~capitals~~ in the game. 
---
anything
---
Yeah I dont miss the days of PL Jumping across the entire galaxy to drop on every fight thank you.
---
Fighting on station undocks was also cancer with station games, don't miss that either.  
---
This all just seems like rose colored glasses of the past really...
---
I'm gonna step on the glass
---
Tonight I'll fly and be your lover
---
PI got released in 2010
---
Yes but they're not under real pressure to do that so they can pick times when its not that dangerous and also don't need to start a massive mining op now which you guys could potentially drop on.
---
I think if NC-PL formed with Horde, GOTG, Tri and Test, all together, they would probably be able to defend it, yes.  In fact I'm certain they would (tactical errors notwithstanding).   
---
This is why you probably shouldn't farm your potential allies in peacetime.
---
Doesn't count, can just put new down. Obviously the north has unlimited cash reserves.
---
No fucking shit, when you outnumber someone 7 to 1.
---
I mean that's a narrow definition of pay to win, if a skin in league of legends makes a effect less clear League of legends is pay to win same for over-watch because there is a fight you only won because of the skin. ( such skins existed back when i played league ). 
---
Now the reason eve isn't pay to win but pay to skip, is because a player how isn't paying can achieve everything a paying player is, all the RL money does is move you forward in the wealth collection mini game. 
---
Now pay to skip can be a horrible mechanic and i do think CCP is getting there where the game get's more and more designed to be a horrible grind to the point where the developer puts more and more pressure on your wallet, now the reason for this is most of these games statistically show once you spent money your more likely to do it again, now we could debate predatory mechanics ( I do think CCP is getting closure to that line where they follow a korean MMO model ).
---
god bless
---
Stop trying to win eve then. Get your ass back.
---
You used to be able to do that too with the character bazzar. Not as precise and easy and without the constant influx of SP from skillfarms, but still.
---
This titan kill brought to you by rep stacking nerfs: the pithum C type remote shield boosters on my Scimitar were repping 88 per cycle once the fax dropped instead of over 400. It was a good change by all appearances.
---
Having a bigger blob just means you win any contest to actually defend the structure. 
---
At least the defenders actually get a time window to counterattack, instead of the keep dying in seconds
---
It looks like a crab
---
Yes, absolutely.  Citadels do need abit of a nerf and I think they should find away to make taking out supers easier from a subcap level ( special ship or something?).  But I sincerely think todays gameplay is better than it was.  Even back then I remember people whinning about the same shit as today.  Capitals were oppressive then, Subcaps kept getting shit on, One ship class dominated the subcap fleet warfare, Sov was too hard to contest for the "little guy", etc, etc ,etc.  And frankly I just have a different opinion about alot of things than the apparent majority.  I Like skill injectors alot, they let me catch up from my breaks as it were.  Everyone always pines for the old days in everything, whether real life or a video game...
---
We're still dying to him. I'm having a hard time figuring out when he *isn't* online... Bob seriously has some free time.
---
But, we're getting more organized. In due time we should be able to field fleets large enough to get a kill here or there. We really just need a few more active pilots and to rub that green off of our existing ones.
---
How is the fucking Neocom STILL FUCKING BROKEN. Fer real roll that bitch back about 10 years.
---
GF Winter
---
I'd think the obvious target is the one that we've more or less been in conflict for the entirety of modern eve.
---
Modern TEST is an entity we're capable of actually working with, and even if we wanted to set a bad precedent of breaking diplo agreements, I don't know what we'd hope to get out of a war with Legacy.  It's not like it'd be "good fights" any more than the current war is.
---
It should be impossible to kill without taking hits from the structure. 
---
It makes no sense that a keepstar cant defend itself from long range xl guns and LR bombers.
---
&gt; nobody stored anything of consequence inside POSes outside of WHs, lets keep the unseemly fan fiction to a minimum.
---
Non-Provi regions outside had relatively small numbers of stations 10+ years ago. If you had something you needed, it didn't make sense to go on a long roam to get it from a station. 
---
We made a mini-game of hunting offlined POSes to grab expensive shit from undefended arrays, so yeah some people risked substantial assets. We even yoinked caps.
---
We got his shield a little red before one shield rep cycle made it all go away. Then, all of our Ospreys got blown up.
---
Hull vexor
---
Congrats?
---
Shhhh, that's the next anniversary gift olanned
---
Except EVERYBODY get drones. üôÅ
---
Not true, now we have to deal with ninja salvaging ships.
---
to be faaaaaair....
---
eve 2k19 is the eve people are proud of bashing ~300 structures, oh boi
---
And justice was served.
---
More than 600 alts here.
---
I can guarantee that you can have more fun than me.
---
Fun in eve is relative, you just need to find yours there. A lot of my friends see their 500m ship as their end-game ship for pvp, they are so happy with that, lie they are fielding a Molok and a x2 Komodo on grid.
---
Find yours! (ps: massive income comes with their alts or A LOT of knowledge of the game)
---
Wait how are we getting blamed for CO2 now? Their leader made RL threats and got banned...repeatedly. Then they fell to pieces.
---
Titans just need a weakness so that using them is that more risky.     
---
Polarized dread weapons could work.    Reduce the dreads defenses to dead, but double the dps allowing dread bombs to kill Titans easier, yet the dread dies as well.
---
Heavy fighters geared and bonused for titans and supers that can't hit anything else.   Temper them by making them super slow so if they are out and you need to swap to hit subs, it's going to take a while.
---
As a pilot of a rorq from before the change, honestly, that ship stunk.    And as it is now, a hulk can mine half as much as one does.   Nerfing them more won't make Eve more enjoyable.   But make it riskier, but without eliminating any chance of saving them.    Prohibit fitting cynos.   Maybe cyno inhibs anchor faster.     But don't kill the best source of content in Eve 2019.   Make them so people still use them.
---
We get it, you had sex
---
what about other player retention issues
---
like the default overview being useless, or the neocom being fucked up, or the tutorial system not explaining how itself works, or how the new player experience is a new tutorial achievement system but also 10 year old career agents and also the SOE epic arc that is literally never mentioned anywhere and you have to Google to find where it is even though it's intended for new players as extended new player tutorial content
---
nope just remake the agency again again again and people like you will go "well they aren't balance guys so it's not like they have anything better to do"
---
Huge reason I don‚Äôt come back to the game is how different it is now. Original 2007 character with sub caps all maxed and I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to begin now.
---
kinda?  again, i clearly don't know the extent of the nerf but i was under the impression that for normal cap fights (like this - i think, wasn't there) faxes would still work as they used to.  It was only when you scaled up the damage that they would no longer be able to rep though it.
---
That's funny. Because in reality, we were told not to, and we didn't.
---
Apparently you weren't around in Delve in 2009, friend. This isn't new.
---
It was "broken" when slowcats were a thing. It's always "broken" for some reason.
---
True, but not all get easy/immediate access to ships with traits that buff drones.
---
nice job
---
to NC/PL it sure does. we just finished firing 15b in lances for the lulz.
---
Thats just making the problem worse.
---
from the creators of single boxed dread drops we get the new release: single boxed carrier unedited structure bash
---
truly a race to the bottom
---
What are they?
---
I personally use Herons, only ship with five mid slots, enough for analysers, prop module and two pinpointing arrays. Another one I've been using in past is Probe, with main advantage being it's agility, maxing your chances of escaping hunters.
---
Honestly if theres one good thing that came out of all the NDA crap it is that he wont run for CSM anymore.
---
The solution is to embrace the meta.  
---
Build a bigger alliance., and not just of ‚Äòleet‚Äô PvPers but of all kinds of people.  
---
Take that larger group, and develop your industrial base to build more and more big toys.  Support gameplay other than ‚Äòleet‚Äô PvP and encourage and protect the people who enjoy gathering and building things.
---
Once you have built an infrastructure to grow both the number of people, diversity of game play and number of capital assets, use them to disrupt the bad guys ability to build capital assets so they can never get caught up.  
---
Sadly, for NC/PL, the time to do those things would have been at the latest a year or two ago.  
---
What the Goons should do is exactly what they are...glass all the things.  
---
Pick the groups that are the biggest threats and never let them get caught up.  Go through the bad guys space every 6 months or so and totally take apart their industrial infrastructure.  Let them laugh at you for destroying structures ‚Äòthey did not want anyway‚Äô.  Just leave them  no sov, no moon mining structures, no jump gates of structures no central market.  Make them rebuilt everything, while we go back to life as usual in Delve....then do it all over again.  This time though they will have fewer people left to rebuild things.  Then do it again..,,
---
You don‚Äôt have to destroy them, just keep them small enough so that they don‚Äôt matter.  
---
Oh well...just my opinion, but I expect that some version of this will play out till we screw something up.
---
you missed a step
---
log in, see big agency window, close it because that's the only button on the window , then *voluntarily open the agency* to find the checkbox there
---
How can you have 250 camper account on two people? That's insane. How do you have time to support that many accounts?
---
no i wasn't, and if gat was anything close to what that was i'm pretty glad that was the case. Although i quite doubt it cause dmg caps.
---
Do it and let us know what happens so we can properly inform the next guy.
---
I'm happy to hear it's working again.
---
I'm curious to know what you were doing in your other windows, though...
---
I play on two screens, and both run at 60fps on max settings, quite easily, but if my 'main' jumps into Abyssal Space... boom. That window still runs at 60, but the other dives down to roughly 17fps - sometimes as low as 8, if the main is sitting in a ball of smoke and fire.
---
Have you not seen the br of lazerhawks major wh alliances? They use caps.
---
Well I guess I'm not getting any direct advantage from it and I did PLEX those accounts in a legitimate fashion so here goes nothing.
---
&gt; Make friends and not be cunts
---
So you're saying the only way left to play in 0.0 is to blob, and the current target blob is about 45k people, so thats your minimal goal?
---
I wonder why so many people left eve.
---
More fun until you inevitably realize how limited your options are with a single account. 2-3 is a minimum to achieve a decent quality of life and potential.
---
first thing i did.
---
same
---
Hundreds and I think, over, 1000 POS killed. Back then Sov was determined by how many POSes one had in a system. 
---
If a system had 10 moons, in order to claim the system, you needed to have a POS on 6 of the moons. So systems that had 80+ moons, you had to have 41 of the moons towered with a POS. 97 systems in delve meant hundreds of POSes.
---
We hellcamped BoB into their stations while our cap fleets flew around and burned them all down. And no, there weren't silly damage caps back then.
---
wow lol nice tears, just get more friends next time and you won't cry so hard
---
Four? I know SC and DU, what are the other two?
---
No? It was there from the start?
---
I was in the first reinforce fleet, a Voltron Harpy. We gated all the way there, and we didn't get to get in on the main RZ- fight, only catching strugglers in &amp; out. The second engagement in BOZ1-O was fun as hell though for us Harpies: the bigger stuff (HACs) were busy among themselves so it was pick and shoot for us smaller stuff. Then the fight on the anchoring TEST iHub happened, and... well, I don't know why FRT started feeding there, but I feel for their own Harpy fleet.
---
Was a super fun engagement all around, a good unexpected afternoon of brawling in Detorid. 
---
GF to all!
---
7o
---
Yes, it's unethical. 
---
But I don't believe it's against the EULA. So it's entirely on your conscience.
---
Not sure if I have to downvote you because provi person or upvote you because Tolkien.
---
Just kidding.
---
Upvote because Tolkien, nearly every time.
---
Mar5hy has 200ish campers. I have 45 campers and 21 pontifex alts (and various "mains"). 
---
He does contracts for camping. I do booshing for ISK. Maintenance is indeed challenging. In an ideal Eve nobody should need that many accounts for anything.
---
Still waiting for the "but you guys lost a Titan I delve the other day" post.
---
You really think there are like rooms of people iterating on the agency? 
---
I‚Äôll agree all those things need to be fixed, I don‚Äôt agree that other things would be happening if the agency wasn‚Äôt happening.  It‚Äôs just something new that doesn‚Äôt effect other things than can be changed quickly, so they can show it in an update.  
---
And again I‚Äôm not supporting any stance, just stating this is how tech-end companies do deliverables.
---
As a pve player even I understand the fun in a faster more nimble PvP rather than the wallet warrior that is Titans.

Out of curiosity, which part is unethical?
---
lol this is so rose colored it's crazy
---
how is it unethical?
---
oh no ive solidly won, none of my old eve friends play anymore, ive tried to get back into it but wihtout them i just ship spin for a couple months then unsub, plus right now my internet absolutely could not handle it. so just promise youll do enough losing for the both of us
---
Because it was done elite players in an elite alliance. If noobs like us do it, then it is game breaking
---
Taking hits is a different thing from having subcaps deleted with no counterplay out to 300km.
---
This is (I think) some flavor of desync where the module is actually fitted to your ship but the fittings window doesn't update. I don't know why it happens.

Voting with 80 accounts today gave me spodbrain. Took about an hour.
---
I don't think it's unethical. I'd use a bot if there were any. 
---
If the game allows people to use that many accounts, makes it viable, makes people need that many accounts for certain stuff they wanna do, and allows people to cast a vote with each account, then it should offer a QOL solution to voting with that many accounts anyway. Now all of the above can be wrong things about the game, but if they are that way there is no reason why you should waste additional time. Just like how input broadcasting is allowed for setting options/logging in/window management.
---
PS: Whatever The Judge is paying you, I'll pay double.
---
One alliance won a super-cap war completely at 49-U6U. After that war, there is no other faction that can stop it. Finally this alliance took control maybe 2/3 of te null-sec by itself or its vassals.
---
Sure but not to the point where the replace conventional fleets entirely.
---
To put that number in perspective, that's about 2x my personal net worth.  It sounds like a lot of isk, and by many measures, it is.  However,  I'm not particularly wealthy by eve standards; there are plenty of people who could personally afford to replace all of those loses.  
---
This isn't a smart-ass already replaced comment, because it isn't.  What has to be understood though is that at this point in Eve, nothing short of a Keepstar BPO is actually truly expensive anymore compared to the fortunes people have amassed. 
---
The true loss is the time and effort spent creating that infrastructure, not the monetary value.  But numbers are easier to communicate I guess.
---
Probably because of things like PL/NC farming brave to near death....or provibloc...etc where small groups are crushed into larger ones. The only thing I see here is Imperium hitting back at the group that took their land in the north. A group that refused to fight...and only have isk based on renters and AT winnings. Not embracing what maximizes wealth after ccps latest set of shit changes.
---
Convo The\_Judge. He buys Votes for ISK.  
---
shitty's CSM ever.
---
 Youve theoretically payed for 90 votes, how is that unethical. Your 90 votes don't count for much in the scheme of things.
---
I'd worry about RSI and the slippery slope of cheetos addiction caused by your playstyle.
---
whoever loot all that  is so happy now hahah
---
Of course vote buying is allowed in Eve I didn't realize that was a thing how much is the current rate?
---
Atleast they undock and fight.
---
It finally happened. Fuzzy Steve said something I disagree with!
---
From Tenal, over Branch &amp; Deklein, next to Pure Blind, Fade to Fountain, and Delve and Querious, never seen CFC with more sov then now.  
---
If you count Legacy part of CFC, like back in the days, then also the south is under BeeControl.

My experience in Eve is that by having money you can make money on the industry which is what I've been doing to drip feed 10 million a day.
---
However the lowest risk is recommend you try so you don't go broke is get a 2m t1 explorer fit and explore 0.5 0.6 for relic and data sites. I was making 20m an hour doing it myself.
---
Remember don't fly what you can't afford to lose, putting 2 6m ships in low sec isn't a good idea for a learning experience when all you have is 10m

Because one of the big issues facing the NPE and retention, and therefore one of the big causes of the absolutely abysmal retention rates, is the fact that people often don‚Äôt know what to do in EVE. It‚Äôs an enormous game, with a ton of gameplay options right out of the gate. The agency presents these in a clear manner that allows people to go ‚Äòok I can do this.‚Äô Before now, many people would finish the career agents and just stop, because they were unsure what to do. It‚Äôs not super obvious what the daily routine in EVE should be because of how many options there are.

[https://imgur.com/fwdpU4H](https://imgur.com/fwdpU4H) \- for a size reference, the reproduction ratio is 100 meters = 1 centimeter. I wasn't the one printing them btw, just corrected the models size to the right size. Providence  came off great(as a big banana) and Machariels are quite good looking as well. Taloses and Golem not so much, but still okay. Need to make them bigger. The one big problem I still have is that I want to print Nidhoggur/Hel as well, but I don't have the skills(or a desire to learn them) in order to change their models into something printable. So I'll wait until someone more capable does it and shares his work.  
---

---
&gt;Non-Provi regions outside had relatively small numbers of stations 10+ years ago. If you had something you needed, it didn't make sense to go on a long roam to get it from a station.
---
Which is why we built outposts.  It turns out you didn't need one in literally every system to store stuff.
---
Pirate Super Titans,    
---
T2 Titans,   
---
Then, Super Duper T3 Strategic Titans. With Rorquals for mining drones while they shoot Nyxes out of the fighter bay.
---
nevertheless it *could* happen and was taken into account when decisions were made, effectively aborting content that would have happened otherwise
---
It seems BRAVE and Provi and their struggle for survival are at the very core of everything that is currently deemed to be wrong with the game. I for one am truly shocked.
---
Thanks mate! It's reception by the community made me sleep with a smile a few nights.
---
the thing is you often have to game the reactive so being damage locked means you can't push the reactive around.
---
For sure, but I don't know if the current meta of disposable 4.5m EHP Apostles with the rep power of 18 Aeons is all that much of an improvement in practice.
---
Algos instead of tristan
---
Unless CCP drastically changes the rules, this server will go the way of serenity. The only question is how long it will take. Luckily I think Hilmar and CCP realize this, as evidenced by his comments in Australia, and so I expect some big game changing actions to occur
---
I remember it being a huge issue when I was in Facwar. In most areas, committing capitals to a fight without a batphone of your own already on hand was a guarantee of getting dunked on. In other areas, depending on who was staged where, you could commit quickly - but being on field for longer than ~15-20 minutes would yield the same.
---
PL and Shadow Cartel are the names that stick out most in my memories, but I remember the Russians rolling through at times as well. It was one of the factors that forced Amarr/Minmatar FWfrom BS/BC brawls to mostly cruiser and below.
---
You're obviously just tryna bait out a fight, noones seriously this dense.
---
I may be back there soon but my gangs are still gettin fites.

---
I'm tempted to train all of them into booshers and just go steal stuff from Goons.
---
Hahah, I though about that, but:
---
1) Is there a logi with a model that is not a nightmare to print? Frigates are too small, the rest are too complex.
---
2) I'm a noob, so where we're going we won't need repairs.
---
godbless the doom ost
---
agreed, the tristan is a very poor PvE boat because it has no bonuses to DPS
---
I get what you mean, but I don't know if it's all that different. Say someone lived in Black Rise, right after Phoebe if they tried to use capitals all that happened was they got dunked by Snuff instead of PL. Except now they can't even batphone or bait for PL to counter-drop Snuff so Snuff got more brazen and you were even more oppressed than before.
---
But Tristan is a great FW ratter compared to Algos
---
No, of course that isn't allowed. The intent of the alpha restriction is to prevent you from using the free account while using any other account. Whether you use VMs, a second computer, a server, or just the trick of clicking the character login option at the exact same time‚Äîit's still against the rules...

With current Excav prices the profit isn't what it's used to be. But it's definitely still worth it because it's an actually fun way of making ISK.

Welcome to the jumping instead of bridging club my friend.
---
Make a weapon that deals damage based on ship mass
---
there would be some ways, like make some one blue for an ally costing them isk, to attack structures of someone declear war the that corp/ally, and ony then you can do damage, so no mass whoring on citas, or like divide ore in 4-8 partes, and each is found in different regions so in the north only 174 or 1/8 of needed ore can be found, rest is in south, west, east, or if in 8 parts of nullsec.  
---
Make big allies or even coalitions very expensive. Or ratting, the bigger the ship (e.g. sig) the more dmg the rats will do, and the less you hit them, atm you can rat in a passiv super/titan and the passiv shield reg will to enough to rat 24/7.  
---
Also skill injectors only on alpha-skills, no more injecting a fax-, a dread-alt or even super-alt.
---
I imagine your ratting is belt loops for clones, mordus, and unsuspecting people who can't fight a scythe fleet issue. ;)
---
I had fun.  
---
DDs Green all the way!!
---
We only really hold power over Delve, fake Delve/ Querious, Fountain is INIT, and Period Basis b/c lol no one else wants it
---
No what made things worst was citadel spam. If you have nowhere to store blobs of supers and titans they are vulnerable.
---
I generally recommend caldari for newbros to get into abyssal blitzing in a caracal because vni running is boring.
---
Indeed! I was thinking of upgrading to an Ishtar or some other HAC so I could run the covert research facilities
---
At this point that's already to late, like limiting it now will only lock in the existing power blocs.
---
Not actually true. Horde was originally founded as an ewar wing which then exploded in a cloud of autonomy and independence. NCPL and Horde only recently began to resemble something that was more than a coalition in name only.
---
Is it possible to edit your ballots? I need to fix all of mine after seeing this.
---
Except cyno jammers exist so you're just spouting nonsense, If they don't lose the ihubs etc they can anchor cyno jammers and then tada no escalation  but they're too busy saying they don't care about that space anyway, shit leadership leading the blind to their demise. And they're to stupid to realise it
---
Ludicrously Rare Titan
---
Nah, that shit was just as broken.
---
cool ill try the Heron. Thanks guys
---
All good points, with your reputation you know a lot more about this kind of thing than me.
---
With the way the system is set up now I don't really see a way for CCP to either 'solve' the problem with jump fatigue or locally dominant groups without making other fundamental changes to the game design;
---
* With no JF you would have one two dominant groups teleporting around the entire map on a whim
---
or 
---
* Locally dominant groups oppressing their regions/systems in range. ("You're talking a lot of shit for someone within 7LY")
---
Perhaps there could be new activities added which would allow someone to live in a certain region of space without worrying or being especially impacted by a cap-heavy group that lives in the area. By this I mean how losing a citadel, for instance, could be a blow to a group wanting to live in lowsec. 
---
But then you would be limited to activities that take you out of the space and into an instance like abyss content, you could do that anywhere, so what's the point of doing it *there*?
---
Eve players play real chess
---
I think that‚Äôs his point. Fozzie SOV wouldn‚Äôt suck so many dicks if there weren‚Äôt damage caps. It‚Äôs a way more complex than that but we‚Äôve had this conversation a thousand times but the bottom line is damage caps make blue balling an acceptable strategy. If they show up for a timer with a million dudes well who cares, only 25 of them actually matter and you just wasted everyone else‚Äôs time. If you only bring enough to meet the damage cap then they will want to fight your 25 dudes with 300. 
---
It‚Äôs just generally really bad game mechanics but if you tell Fozzie how fucking bad his SOV mechanics are his pussy starts to throb and he bans you. So adapt or quit.
---
Oh, we killed quite a few alliances and coalitions in our time.   
---
What makes you think we should play your game?
---
I lived in WH space during that time. I do agree. It was a lot of fun back then. The only thing I really miss is the Alliance Tournament. I really liked watching it.
---

---
Sweet!
---
the guardian and oneiros should be relatively easy to 3D print?
---
Yes, the game has become worse than it was.
---
2,000,000 damage (deflected)

You don't want to lose your home, of course you try to go for a sure win

Hi NC

along with a whole bunch of other police skins, for gallente ships.
---
Aww, that's cute.
---
At the end of an abyssal site there are two gates, origin (lets you go back to normal space) and proving (pvp gate). Once the pvp is over an origin gate opens up and you go back to where you activated the filament.
---
The recipient of a referral link loses nothing by putting in that code. If anything, some (not all) referral programs offer a slight discount to the recipient to encourage them to sub and get hooked.
---
Ref links do exactly what they're designed to do. Encourage the spread of sales/promos/subscriptions by giving a small incentive to the inviting player. I don't see anything wrong with that, unless it's one of those "make ez money online" pyramid schemes where referrals/surveys are literally the only thing they do.
---
Dunno where you got your numbers tho.
---
finally, with the last cap nerf. You can actually fight against an enemy capital fleet. In an only subcap setup

Wow wtf. Lazy basta\*\*.

---
Every fucking coalition backstabbed or got backstabbed multiple times in this game. Is this new ? 
---
Typical TEST member answer : we got backstabbed so we won't ally with X.
---
Spoiler alert : "not really allied with the imperium anymore" sounds fake when you show up on every timer on their side. Granted we didn't see you often in this war because you have FRAT to handle.
---
Then I suppose we should hope to see germinate falls to really crush those hopes my fingers are crossed
---
Happy karma farming but really ... the new Agency is actually quite good, and if you don't want it, it takes two seconds to see that checkbox.
---
Actually I think it even defaulted to off, at least for my accounts.
---
Remind me! in 2 hours
---
Nah that's just NcPLs backs making that noise
---
It was obviously a tactical feed, to bait out all those dreads.
---
????
---
You could kill cap fleets with subcaps easily before Citadel lol. There was no such thing as HAW dreads, Old triage had less than half the tank and was highly vulnerable to neuts, and carriers did hardly any damage so below a critical mess (where upon dreads would make mince meat of them anyway) you could just start bumping them apart with mwds.
---
While I personally might now have as much ISK atm, how much do you have? Not saying that they have lots a whole lot of ISK. But lately I have legit been thinking about the amount of money a single person sit on, in comparison to what a whole alliance might. Just an interesting thought.
---
1: ncpl is undocking and fighting you almost daily during this "war", at least when you bring only 2 times our numbers or less. you can't expect us to feed our 100 man gang to provide content for your 600 spodbrains.
---
2: tell me more about our "role". we try to have fun as best as we can in these fucked up nullsec mechanics, and loading the alliance with with idiots, crabbing 23/7 with 10 rorqs and blueing up with anybody in sight isn't fun at all
---
3: the 3 big coalitions in this game, imperium legacy and panfam soak up almost all new players. as I said, the nullsec mechanics are more retarded these days than ever before. to stand on your own feet, you need 3 things: big numbers, a lot of krabs and a lot of supers. 
---
but you can't get big numbers without safe space. you can't get safe space without supers. you can't get supers without krabs. and you can't get krabs without big numbers.
---
are you getting the problem?????
---
4: yeaaaaah, the renter space is the problem this game has, lol. you don't seem dumb, pls use your brain and think outside of your goon war propaganda.
---
5: watch 4
---
6: horde is an alliance on its own. they don't have ratting rights in ncpl space, as well as ncpl has no ratting rights in horde space. 
---
Considering the rest of your post: I don't condemn goonswam to make proper use of the current game mechanics, no matter what I think about them myself. 
---
However, there is more than just mechanics. Goonswarm is actively killing nullsec content with their behaviour. You killed co2, probably one of the biggest content creators, by encouraging someone to steal their money. For maybe 1 or 2 weeks of fun on reddit. Nice.
---
Although you don't seem to be like that, the average goon drops even frigates with their titan, killing every piece of content in delve, querious and southern fountain.
---
And you blue up with everyone in side, forming the tapirium with more than 75% of nullsec players. Your own alliance is the reason todays eve is so static. If Goonswarm had hostile or at least neutral standings to legacy and maybe to init, the game would be far more enjoyable. Don't try to make others responsible for the decisions of the goon leadership that hasn't actually logged into eve for such a long time that they forgot what the actual goal of this game is: having a fun time with friends and internet spaceships.
---
Some final words: as a goon, you should be the last person on reddit that posts about a lack of content. If you want my advise: leave goons like I did a few months ago and join another group that doesn't just focus on outnumbering enemys. Skill urself is really cool, snuffed out too, or Volta. Or maybe fraternity if you prefer something larger.

The titan and super issue can quickly be solved with balance patches that makes them more vulnerable and easier to kill. I wouldn't worry about it to be honest.
---
Keepstars that you can cyno into a fight.
---
&gt; Legacy is actively following that path and reaping the rewards of it.

They're not 'opponents', they blued you because that's the only path to not ending up with this blob at your door.

---
 Just try to guess which one is bait and which one is real. That's right, you can't.
---
&gt; So good organizational structure that attracts dedicated membership makes the game broken?
---
No. Game mechanics that allow a larger organised force to bring a completely uncounterable force to a fight anywhere on the map makes the game broken. Game mechanics that allow people to multibox near-AFK ISK generation under a capital umbrella with almost no risk make the game broken. Mechanics that mean that a capital ship is an I-win button you can press on demand in a small gang subcap situation make the game broken.
---
Salvage was a nice touch.
---
Yes and no, you could not get 5 rorqs pilots with that much ease, and it was a pretty big time investment to train those, so let's say rorqs would get buffed, it will take far more time for you to be able to get those rorqs alts that fast as SOMEONE needs to train them to sell them (which in a perfect world gives more time for ccp to adress the problems with the changes).  
---
Either way what's done is done injectors will not go away and the rorqs already did their damage to the community, let's see what the future brings.
---
Not so much at least because the opponent can have same ship / fit. 
---
It s not like gold ammo or stuff like this.
---
Look at this guy : sure he spent A LOT of plex in the game. Is he winning? No. https://zkillboard.com/character/92430609/
---
&gt; If NC/PL is unable or unwilling to adapt to the current meta, and remember what they can do, that this emboldens the young turks of Eve to knock them down and assume their role.
---
&gt; Disrupts some Null sec space where one or more smaller groups set up shop and start growing, and making content for all.
---
But you can't really do either of those things when there's a threat of a million titans dropping on you from Goonperium at any time.
---

---
Spoken thrice shall summon forth a blops fleet.
---
Well at least I have one way to tell that you‚Äôre still breathing since you no longer respond to text messages. Close to giving up though.
---
At least a battleship fleet can't jump across the map near-instantly, so you can delay it at gates, and there are counterplays with smaller ships that mean you have interesting skirmishes.
---
The game would be far better if there weren't combat capitals, tbh.
---
Not really. That depends on the specific issue and there is a greater chance of getting that "expert" answer if they ask the community.
---
&gt;Wormholes discovered this last time around when CCP proposed changing lurch HICs by removing their mass manipulation and nobody was in the room to tell them this would affect rolling math.
---
And why should you have the ability to do that? Was it the intention of the design that it be used for that purpose? You think you should have someone that protects your way of playing the game, and if you dont, "there is a problem". No group of players should have that privilege.
---
Actually, it's quite bad. I'm sadly forced to use it, and unless it's a super hidden option, there's no way to sort agents by jumps.

Hello who is this
---
triage was strong but neutable in wormholes before you got the cap boosters
---
Sigh..... was fun tho. Great Morning
---
Guardian - would be 2 centimeters in length if I wanted to keep reproduction ratio consistent, and outer armor plates would be impossible to print.
---
Oneiros - 3 cm long, but would require removing some small details. Not really worth it.
---
Nestor would be nice, sooo may be?
---
One side having 1000 titans and the other side not showing up is no different than one side having 1000 frigates and the other side not showing up. It's a numbers thing and one side clearly has recruited better and the other side has clearly held onto the notion of "elite". We see how that worked out.
---
Because otherwise my way of playing will be hit with side effect nerfs until its no longer possible, so there is a problem in the sense that if you don't your way of playing will just not be possible.
---
thanks, im not going back into trading. Its far to much work if you arent one of the 1% :D
---
I think that sounds cool, gonna check that out I think
---
So you want to care-bear without using the menu designed for care-bears? I was going to ask if you are the real TikkTokk but I think I got my answer already.
---
But we got incursions v2 that will fix some kind of issue? You not happy? Lets just inject some more Titans!
---
&gt;My only suggestion would be a gun type for dreads that are more effective towards supers and titans
---
The entire economy is basically broken.
---
it would be better to use this   [*Flight of the Bumblebee*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYAJopwEYv8)
---
&gt; Is it healthy for the game as a whole? Of course not
---
... which sounds worth 'crying' about, doesn't it?
---
I want to run locators, actually.
---
Until that fucker does something about injectors and bots, nothing will change.
---
Yeah... that memes played out by now.
---
In a rerun of Futurama saying "kill all humans"
---
World War CSM boys.
---
Well okay maybe but FAX are broken as shit today, so it's not like CCP even fixed that.
---
Was it the intention of the design that it be used for that purpose?
---
What's wrong with a 'locally dominant group'? Eve is big enough that there's lots of different places to be 'local'.
---
I guess one of the ppl trying to rep you 100km away;)   
---
I think at least that was you
---
Lol what is this 2009
---
10/10 would watch it again.
---
Subliminal messaging
---
Ok mr x-types thats good for you but everyone who was actually using them in 2013 had [a or b-type passives](https://img.skyride.org/FCtvGy.png) so you didn't get owned by the capacitor bug.
---
Man, I haven't heard that song is years, brings back some gooood memories. 
---
Cheers for the video was trying to follow what was going on from work, nice to see it from this perspective.  
---
"my name is tuz, and i'm the imperium's head POS-bitch"
---
So is your pitch "vote for me I'm part of the problem too" because it's really really hard to come to another conclusion when you fuck up and tell the truth like this. Sanctimonious fuckbag.
---
Idk i think capitals in their entirety were a mistake. You can't really blap a dread off the field without other dreads unlike battleship fleets where you can harass them even with a smaller force.
---
 coming straight from the underground
---
but how do they handle 70km orbiting battlships tho. With the nestors/rattles you just sentry up and hit to 110km or so. Dont they drift out of range?
---
Anyone have a video of that ?
---
&gt; it's pretty poor form to be even on numbers with so many strong tools available and ask for another fleet of the same size to help
---
But it isn't poor form to accept the invitation and then switch sides and evict the people that asked you to help?
---
It may be Hammerwerke but come on.
---
well, yes some coalitions delete their friendships.
---
However, panfam does it ALL the time, as soon as they are bored for one second, they drop everything on you (as long as you have no chance ofc. Once you can fight back, they are scared now)
---
Legacy is basically formed by alliances that were formerly allied and multipletimes backstabbed. you can make a mistake once, or even twice but allying with panfam would not be "giving them a chance" but plain stupid...
---
Only time i was 100km from anyone was when the fight was finally over cause I went to go take a shit
---
If you ask empire builders they'll say there is no way to counterbalance the human motivation of bunching together, blueing each other, coordinating for safety.
---
If you look at various areas of Eve (starting from wormholes) you'll notice that's false. There are diminishing returns in this game for n+1.
---
We just need to find the right mechanics. I have specific mechanics and balance changes I am campaigning with. But more importantly, people need to ask themselves why these groups of 1000-titan capsuleers join in the coalitions they do. And we all can start from there.
---
True lol
---
Always beware the cloaky proteus.
---
What is the difficulty rating for abyss weather? I think dark is the hardest and electrical is easiest? From 1 to 5 pls
---
Is it bad that I want one?
---
Every single time someone posts this they pick a new random number to complain the goons brought.
---
Well they didn't backstab everyone, that was sort. But they do tend to treat anyone they don't feel is "l33t" like dog shit.
---
Nop terrors!
---
Anyone else think the beginning of this video sounds like the intro to this version of [Insomnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKdm2ymuvqQ)?
---
Never said it was better for a reason, because I dislike it personally.  I'm new PL so what they did in the past is just that the past.
---
&gt; we aren't talking 10+
---
I was. Jukebox was removed before 2013. I figure if we're gonna have a when eve was young, thread I would share my own nostalgia laden memories.
---
Of course I should compliment you on your save or something that people actually did keep expensive shit in POSes. Then again, it was still happening after 2013 so I guess... you're still wrong.
---
Yeah that's fair, reading it all back I can see how I'd come off a bit don't spinny. To be a bit clearer, it's definitely opportunism I just wanted to throw out the circumstances behind it as opposed to it seeming like we'd planned to do it.
---
Get some skins pls
---
Should be a capital offence.
---
&gt; The fact that people would dismiss the agency without looking at it closely enough to realize that there's that check box is probably a bigger problem than the agency itself.
---
you mean the problem is the fact that ccp's ux design has been a dumpster fire for the past 5 years?
---
While annoying, the inability to sort (I think that's a problem on all pages, not just the agent one) hardly qualifies as 'cancer'. And you can filter by range, so if you want to find a locator close by, you can do that pretty easily.
---
NCPL: killing undefended stations isn't content.
---
Also NCPL: killing unsupported, undefended, rat fit titans and supers is content.
---
 NCPL: killing undefended stations isn't content.
---
Like the intention of the mass removal had nothing to do with wormholes it was about oversized propmod hics and there decloaking ability. 
---
If you mean if hics where designed for rolling holes nope, but there hardly exclusive in ships that well have more game play roles then there original design outlined this really applies to most ships.
---
I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with it, but a locally dominant group operating in any given area might preclude other groups from setting themselves up in that same area.
---
Given that the map is finite (and rightfully so), this was always going to be a problem.
---
You're lucky I already voted...
---
True and if the FC says ‚Äúno‚Äù then rename your drake to the name of the doctrine ship you‚Äôre supposed to be in. Then it‚Äôs fine to bring.
---
I think I'll leave evaluations of our choices to commenters but sure. Maybe if things had been clearer prior to going it'd have been different but it's impossible to say, especially as I'm not a key decision maker in V0LTA. 
---
Call it how you see it, as I said above I didn't mean to spin quite that hard but here we are.
---
Nice to 1
---
even tho I didnt play back then:
---
-[Spearfishing station undocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTFCCiQnfo)
---
You are only making our industrialists stronger lmao
---
Sure, without doubling down on the spin though it could have been presented that way prior to us prepinging, forming etc. Would it have been different? Who knows.
---
it is so the pact always stays in distance of one another and all have a chance at the prize cans for the bump balance is key anyone can win even a new bro alpha no regen or active as in eve online you cannot break each others tanks if fit certain ways example would be the de-buffing that the Abyssal proving gates give if no de-buff all ships would tank one another and i die.  
---
hope to see all of you out there were all about laughing and having fun thanks for the support from all of you   
---
eve ONline is the best community and always brings me back to good times :)
---
I have a titan for my main, my titan alt has better skills. I was in a loki tonight. 
---
What I would like to see is cap fights aren't escalations from sub cap fights, but their own thing. That seems to be what most folks want.
---
Bullhonkey
---
If you want size, do a fax. The apostle would be the most stable without a stand
---
Keep going, this is good material!
---
Well, since I was there when the doctrine was created, I think it's clear that I understand it. And since we use Raven as the shorthand for the entire fleet, which includes many different ship types than Ravens, I think it was obvious I was speaking about the doctrine, not the battleship.
---
Just for that, I'm going to run again.
---
Still not even a 1/4 of want goons have lost in delve since they deployed
---
200 frigates vs 200 frigates results in frigates being alpha'd. 200 battleships vs 200 battleships results in battleships being alpha'd. 200 dreads vs 200 dreads results in dreads being alpha'd. It's about numbers, not ships.
---
It does 150kdmg reduced by sig....once it can only hit once.... the sig reduction is so bad that it cant even kill an antitanked corm... its trash.
---
So you want me to give up multiaccounting because I believe it's a problem. But you, your buddies and everyone else can keep enjoying it. Imagine being this much blinded by hate lol.
---
They should put the buttons back where they used to be, the game could use more fights like this.
---
his last term ended with the wizard hat debacle so fairly unlikely
---
I would like to see cap vs. cap warfare, and sub vs. sub warfare, with less interaction between the two. Caps shouldn't be an "I win" button every time you decide to field them.
---
I think the problem came with the industry patch a few years back. Making it possible to basically have an infinite number of industry jobs on any given structure. As a result of that pretty much anything is easyly replaceable as it will not take much time to rebuild whatever is killed. I mean we are doing the preproduction of a Titan in what time? 2 days? So less than a month from the ore to a built Titan. 
---
So losing big stuff does not really hurt...
---
No it's quite different. You can bomb, jam, dampen, neut, boosh, kite or counter comp 1000 subcaps. You can't do shit against 1000 titans except bring 1500 titans.
---
Part of the reason that happens is because there are relatively few big cap on cap fights these days, so folks want to drop the hammer on anything that moves.  I would prefer that not be the case, and there be more situations where caps are used, generally against other caps.
---
I didn't deny the existence of outposts. The idea that "nothing of consequence" was stored in N space POSes is wrong. 
---
You might have never stored your expensive stuff in one but plenty of people have. CSAAs, SMAs, Labs all dropped juicy stuff even if the drops and destroyed items didn't make it to the killmails for years.
---
Asset safety is lame, IMO. At the very least, that 15% cost to the player should be changed to a 15% per item chance that it dropped/destroyed where it stands (depending on the RNG gods) and you should never be able to voluntarilly transport it with asset safety magic.
---
Doing that would make structure killing more worth the grind because your four billion isk blingmobile has a 15% chance to drop.
---
Oh, and
---
Jukebox please.
---
The saddest part is that all these Titans exist but no one ever has real fights with them. I wanna see fill Titan fleets going head to head, but inevitably one side stays docked. So it's just mega blocks pooping on each other's structures while everyone else watches.
---
Your logic would want someone on the CSM to promote reverting links and wardecs because thats how someone played the game. This is just absurd and an argument for getting rid of it.
---
So we need boosh titans?
---
They came up with slowcats (carriers), when those stopped working they came up with wrecking ball(supers), both were considered perfectly fine by them at the time, it wasn't until numbers stopped being in their favor this became a "broken" game.
---
I was on the CSM with Mittens, he didn't push ~the goon agenda~ then, so I'm not sure why other Goon CSMs would try to do that and require some sort of counterbalance.
---
Obviously it has changed since 2006. But the reality is that we don't see massive supercapital brawls every day. There hasn't really been a real super fleet vs. super fleet fight since X47.  There are obviously dreadbombs all the time, and random titans that get caught on move ops, and some back and forth, but it's rare. 
---
I wish it was less rare. The only way to fix supercapital proliferation is for more of them to die more often.
---
Yes. Not only is it clearly visible but it was mentioned in the patch notes before it was released.
---
crybaby detected.
---
GSF empire will fall apart sooner than later.They are not and won't be getting any decent fights because they can't fight anyone in subcaps without dropping supers. People getting fed up with the structure bashes and uncontested SOV warfare and slowly going inactive. They want to go after Vale and Geminate next but they can barely get 150 people last couple of days in AUTZ. Most of the decent FCs they have  either left the alliance or are not playing the game (wondering why). Eventually decent pvpers and elite f1 monkeys will leave to join someone else for better content (I see TEST is the hottest alliance right now) and they will be left with high sec spod brain pubbies (oh I heard they are also getting upset because the war is taking too long and they can't mine).
---
well i either mix you up with someone or the enemy warped onto you while you were taking a shit XD
---
I'll take that offer, but idk how much The Judge is paying.
---
I wonder what happend to Lenny. He was so hyped up back then in almost every thread. But after the war and the ban ... nothing. Hope the guy is doing well.
---
I think you fail at history.
---
Panfam mostly don't keep blues because it kills content, the same way we sometimes reset Horde for content. You don't keep allies for long or you start to become Goons, which is not what we are playing for.
---
Basically you are telling us that we should be goons by now. Right.
---
As for fighting smallers enemies, like when we fight TEST blobs, or goons blobs. You do understand that we can form at most half as much people as you and still stomp you in actual fights ?
---
Issue with test is you are the second largest coalition in the game, and you only side with the first one. We don't care about you being allies to us or not, but showing at every goon timer just shows you are some kind of goon pets. Same things with GOTG showing on goons timer (despite sort saying they'll stay neutral, lol).
---
Also a great logi ship.
---
You can‚Äôt really rank them as it depends on what ship/fit you‚Äôre going to use.  For instance dark is really hard if you‚Äôre using a turret, but much easier with missles or drones. Likewise an ab fitted sacrilege is difficult to use in a gamma filament but much easier in a dark.
---
You must have killed his rorqual
---
Well, he can do that as an Omega with probably better results.
---
Well that's the beauty of it. When winter comes around all of the Super Titans will die off.
---
Genuinly curious why you find it unethical.  Distasteful that the game is in a state that it becomes a thing, but not sure how the ethics change from him manually voting on each account.
---
Until keepstars I don't think this was as big of a deal, I make the assumption that a lot  of people would never of gotten supers if they couldn't dock them. I never wanted a super prior and now I've got two, they just sit in the keepstar most of the time. Being able to dock them was 1 factor, the other in my opinion is the fact that super proliferation is a direct result of being able to anchor all those structures to a point where it would be utterly ridiculous to invade a stable region without having the extreme super numbers we are seeing, which is due to reinforcement mechanics. I dislike the timers as they are, I dislike tether and I miss the ability to rape cage pos' and stations
---
Just curious, but what is the origin of your reddit nickname? Specifically the ST part.
---
2 Praxis, a fuckton of rallypoints and an autistic buddy (maybe even yourself) running escalations.
---
Classic EVE scamm, the fucking bottle is empty.
---
&gt; Disrupts some Null sec space where one or more smaller groups set up shop and start growing, and making content for all. 
---
I wish that would happen, but that isn't going to happen without CCP doing something to help facilitate that. No small group is getting sov without being in some sort of large coalition, and that is just sad. It's horrible for the game. EVE was at its best when nullsec was many fragmented small alliances not working together instead of this awful abomination it has become now.
---
Coming back after 3 years off, the game is still fun for me as a small gang dude, but it's definitely gone downhill and will continue on this path unless CCP does something.
---
I don't think locator agents will help you find your CSM campaign.
---
Hm. I voted on my phone and all I had to do was log in/out on each of my accounts. My votes were already preselected after the first account
---
good god, if that Italian mobster and the slick willy looking lawyer ever joined forces.. we're all fucked.
---
This so much x1000.  Even though there is basically unlimited resources available thanks to Rorqs, at least there was a time delay in getting to a Titan.  Now every edgelord can sit in one as soon as he opens his wallet.  WTF CCP.
---
&gt;I make my videos the way I want to
---
Well, there's no law against it.  It's not likely to interest most people unless you follow certain guidelines, though.
---
He is in TNT so the odds are good lol
---
&gt;idiots losing fights they would have lost otherwise doesn't disprove that
---
Low sec is considerably better than HS for this, yes! o/
---
Null sec is also considerable better! &gt;.&gt;
---
Not to rain on your parade, I'm sure you understand this game on a deeper level than I. But I've played EVE on and off since 2012. For some of that I've been in Corporations, for most of that I've been Solo because that's how I prefer to play any game. The Agency window is the single best change I've ever come back to.  It has taken a lot of tedium out of the game for solo players (relying on Wikis and their "imagination" to decide what to do next) and given me the ability to be just slightly more structured with a goal to chase every time I log on. 
---
I'm loving it and I'll be sticking around for a very, very long time which is pretty much 100% because of the new Agency window.  I can't be the only person who feels this way.  I understand your frustrations, but without the Agency window they wouldn't have my $15/mo. and I'm sure there's others out there who would agree. In that sense, it's not a waste of resources at all, it's keeping the lights on.
---
Yeah CCP's dedicated balace team is on the case!
---
Then give her bees... in killmail form
---
This isn't a good thing and doesn't serve as a defence for his arguments.
---
"Now that we don't do that any more its completely unfair."
---
Nice.
---
Goons claim 1000 titans but they've never fielded more than low 300s ever.
---
If you don't want to give your stuff to a goon, can I have it?
---
But they didn't complain then because it was them doing it.  NOW its an issue.
---
I have irl commitments on Tuesday morning 10am so I can't alarm clock for that. Happy that your mom let you wake up early though.
---
We're just doing what Goons have done for ages (think WWBEE when rest of eve was at your door) - don't give you content, don't undock.    Eve, the only winning move is NOT to play.
---
When did I say that you should? I'm saying you brought this upon yourselves but apparently you can't recognize that. You're the ones that drove people away, and in doing so created more enemies than you are willing to fight.
---
The keepstar is no M-O
---
it's not a small club as i'm a gold member too
---
I've played off and on since 2012 and flown in huge fleets, played solo, done a bit of everything basically.  
---
I just started the SOE arc today for the first time because it's in the new Agency window.  I had heard about it before, but never bothered looking it up or what it was at all.  The Agency window isn't a solution to everything obviously but it's a huge step in the right direction. Next up they definitely need to make the default UI less shit, it was frustrating to me after logging in for the first time in 2 years last week that I had to redo my UI for the 1000th time.  I feel ya there, they've got a lot of work to do but they've also got forever to do it.  I don't think this game could ever die.
---
"We lost"- The North  
---
"NOPE, you lost" - Goons
---
You should only have ONE vote tbh....üòë
---
&gt;lives in khanid
---
&gt;is irrelevant
---
I thought the isk killed on both sides would be closer but after a quick look i found about 870bill killed in Delve its a bit iffy to say what would have died if you stayed home and you cant count it as purely panfam kills either but just in Delve you lost   
---
22 super@20 =440bil  
---
4 titans@80 =320bil  
---
22 roqua@5  =110bil  
---
that puts you well in the green so op succes i guess.
---
aye makes perfect sense. Remind me though, not to call you on defense if it may look like I have superior numbers :)))
---
It s like one of those weird mtg cards : deals 5 damage to your opponent if your hp is lower. otherwise it deals 5 damage to you
---
My contracts are full, lets trade in station
---
The only real problem is that a local dominant group still controls everything between Jita and the periphery behind them due to nature of logistics. When that group is strong enough to control an entry region it has a lot of blues/ pets/ renters.
---
There is no solution that the server can physically handle. Titan balling a keepstar is quite literally uncounterable.
---
[Goddamnit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/11/68/3a116884945f870924f1ffd3f36fc015.png)
---
I don't get it why some people seem to think that this is a herculean task for ccp, they have done it before, they nerfed titans several times over the years when people started complaining about their power and prevalence, if titans start to become a major issue i see no reason why CCP would hold back from either nerfing them directly or buffing the things that kill them, they already kinda nerfed titans with the fax nerf, we'll see how those nerfs will play out in the next titan engagement (if it even happens again) but hopefully more of those things will die.
---
There is a lot more stuff that they can do, some stuff may require a lot of work, but changing a few stat numbers for titans is hardly a difficult thing, even for CCP.

If GSF is Germany then TEST is their Italy.

Was at work, couldn‚Äôt participate except by watching the rage pings. More caps! More carriers! More Muninns!
---
I guess that's what happens when meme candidates are elected to CSM.
---
That was no fun for "the alliance" PL either. There were always a group of 20 individuals PL hunters and if things went really bad you could ping the alliance and get trolled afterwards.
---
Just look the number of goon, init, test, ph, frat and brave. It s a lot of player.
---
Old school rats will always shoot you, the mining fleets and response fleets will be blue on your overview. They wont shoot you, but will actually rep you if your under attack and they have logi ongrid.

hi penif

You are better than neutral, you could actually run some missions for them.

csm candidate bullying player

more news at 10

How did he break you though? Isnt he rapid lights? And you have an active hardener. Just rep back in the reload no?
---
You guys sound so butt hurt lmao.
---
Ssh, we don't talk about :krabdeath:...
---
The only reason people were more careful with capitals is because one group had a dominant supercap force that teleported across New Eden for kills.
---
I dont care what you do because I dont live in Delve, but it should interest the reader that you are both admitting your hypocrisy and using some pedestrian cry of "oh yer just salty lol" as your response to it being pointed out. You're just a dirtbag, that's all, but this is nothing new.
---
Old rats dumb, New rats smart.

You're in the Imperium. You're literally part of the problem.

Be the change you wish to see in the world.
---
I want to tell which subcaps are the least active in terms of killboard activity in the past month by class. How can I do this?
---
Star Citizen, Dual Universe, Crowfall (albeit this one might not count), and then Starbase will be amazing if they put the right sov mechanics around their construction system (but they'll probably fail somewhere).
---
That or isboxer, isboxer being way better
---
You seem sincere.
---
The people winning by a cheaty method aren't going to complain. Just like goonswarm and panfam weren't bitching while abusing citadel hopping to the point ccp took that away. Why would you? You're winning without any risk.
---
The fear of it happening was usually enough.  Used to be mad cautious of the PL boogeyman appearing.
---
Faxes would be hard as well. 40 cm long with this reproduction ratio and with a lot of probably thing and hard to print details. Would probably require quite a few model modifications, of which I am incapable. Although yea, having the Apostle would be nice...
---
Huh mines not auto checked. Never had a problem
---
Maybe I was too dumb to find the "make a link" button. Anyway, the deed is done.
---
What's the point of fighting back if your tank is made of tissue paper
---
Osprey/Basilisk isn't so bad if you angle it right, but none of them are ideal. I've screwed up a lot of Apostles.
---
&gt; all faxes undock
---
like 8 faxes jump in
---
what kind of fax numbers are those?
---
it's more like a who cares the game is fuckin dead
---
But he decloaked on his cakeday.

HOLY KEK
---
IS DIS TRUE?
---
Now, i am going to fuckin buy an Erebus.
---
Sorry for the late reply. 
---
I would highly recommend practicing this fit in t3 darks and work your way up as you get comfortable. 
---
1. All of my eve clients are on the same monitor. I use eve o preview to switch fast. All overviews and layouts are the same for faster context switching. 
---
2. Set your orbit to 15km. 
---
3. Designate on of your accounts as the tagger. Tag all the things however you feel comfortable. This helps you focus fire quicker. 
---
4. Add all of your pilots to your watch list so you can see which one is getting shot at. 
---
5. Orbit the gate at 14km, shoot the tags in order. Loot. Profit. 
---
5.a if you come across a sleeper cruiser spawn eith lucid x, orbit the gate at 20km. 
---
5.b if the gate is within range of a short range deviant automata, orbit something else that is out of range. If nothing is out of range, try orbiting the gate at a closer range. If that doesn't work, orbit the ship you are targeting. In this last case have two of your pilots approach your main pilot "the tagger" and make sure that he doesn't get too far away. 
---
5.c in situations with a lot of anchoring damavik or tangling dmamaviks or starving damavik. Decide which one to shoot first. Fast. The one eith the most amount of ships needs to die fast. You can comfortably tank some of the frigates while under webs and scrammed, but if you are webbed, scrammed, neuted, you die.  This is generally what caused me to lose ships. If there is only two or three tangling and one to two starving, kill the anchoring first. If there is 4 or 5 webbing and only 2 or 3 anchoring and one to two starving, kill tangling first. If there are equal amounts and more than 2 starving, kill the starving then tangling then anchoring. This is in no way a reliable priority list, but I've had some success in surviving these waves. 
---
6. Don't go for all the cans in t5. You will die due to timer. Only so it in t4 if you are comfortable.
---

For what it's worth, I could put up the first section at normal speed, it'd show us landing close to and engaging Hole Control's Muninns while G-Force are tethered, when we decided to swap there was only actually a single Bhaalgorn untethered.

I am someone that REALLY understand that,lol

Wait what how ?

Like so far i have explained to you why the nerf was needed ( highly maneuverable hics ) and that the rolling nerf was a side effect. 
---
I rejected the notion of using original design as a good source for judging well the quality of a game play change. 
---
Now the comment before that included the notion that area's of a space historically with a lack of CSM representation have been nerfed an nerfed and nerfed to the point where there player count dropped off a cliff ( lowsec is always the prime example ), now i suspect this is because CCP will not consider your area all that important in balance changes. 
---
None of this should lead you to a conclusion that i want off grid links back or i'm against the wardec changes.

Heavy multiboxing is practically mandatory to hunt nowadays, especially since cloaky camping is massively superior to any other method.

Personally, I like the idea of sending a robot out to do the fighting for me: "Never send a human to do a machine's job."
---
Mechanically, it does DPS minus application out to a specific range after transit time, complementing guns (instant DPS minus application and falloff, no hard range cap) and missiles (lagging DPS minus application, hard range cap).  Moreover, while you lose no application by kiting, your DPS itself is vulnerable.
---
VNI is pretty good at killing NPCs because its heavy drones do high DPS, have application buffs, transit time penalty is reduced because NPCs are generally bunched up, NPCs don't often try to defang it, you don't need short-range EWAR (scrams, webs) so you can kite, allowing you to mitigate incoming damage and get out fast if hostiles enter, etc...
---
While drone boats are often used for PvP, they're not quite as good at it as they are at PvE due to the NPCs' stupidity.
---
The latter issue really springs from the former.
---
I realize this may sound like hyperbole, but I honestly feel that until CCP eliminates or severely nerfs injectors, *no other change made in the game will fix the current major issues.* Maybe they can hit the symptoms - citadel spam, infinitely-respawning ore and combat anomalies, make supercap umbrellas less oppressive, etc. But the ability to instantly attain perfect skills in whatever the absolute best tool for your job is makes any balance quickly unsustainable.

---
And then CCP saw how shit that was for everyone, and we got space aids to counter it. 
---
Hopefully they see how shit it is for anyone to have 600 titans and supers shitting on everything and do something about that too.
---
WHAT.  ARE.  THOSE?   Starships for ants?
---
Lol way to set the time on the BR 5 minutes after the Titan dropped so that it doesn't even have the Rag kill on it.
---
Basilisk is the most interesting one, but without thickness modifications(or just doubling the model in size) it won't be the standard ABS-plastic print, it would have to be polyamide print. And I don't really like polyamide prints. They're okay, but  their texture is weird and so coarse to the touch...
---
Being a new player myself about 3 weeks in, I personally like the agency window.  Before this feature I had to dig through windows and had to google everything.  I still do for a lot of other things but this is a step in the right direction.  Just speaking on my own experience trying to learn the game as a fresh player.
---
We need some kind of massive gun/ship that could hurt SO MUCH others capitals, the bigger shit is, the bigger its damage.
---
oh so they let you actually fight the whole fight? did they dock? or ? 
---
nothing would surprise me from hmw, just curious :)
---
Assuming most of those accounts are for pve purposes, those numbers aren't really inflating anything. The rate at which you can replace Titans is just as important as the actual numbers.
---
why are you saying that?TEST are great enemy, we learned a lot from them.o7 TEST
---
Maybe it's different to what it looked like as we landed but we arrived to a staring match after planning to land in the middle of the muninns once the fight had started.

---
Literally killed me 100 to 0 in the 2nd load, with rep overheated. High grade ask pod + implants + perfect strong exile roll + pretty good deadspace abyssal rep (could have been better but still good) and it still died stupidly fast. Was genuinely shocked by how easy it broke tbh but shit happens.
---
I've seen drones used to mess with reactive, but the first kill shows a hornet.  Orthrus has a 25m3 drone bay, so only one flight of drones.  Would he have a full spectrum, or all kinetic?  What other ways could he mess with it?

that is how many kills they are involved with which is a decent measurement for activity
---
It would help if CCP's UI design wasn't literally 50 shades of gray and damn hard to read a lot of the time.
---
My comment was a sarcastic reflection on the fact that CCP got rid of its dedicated balance team.  So what you're saying might be true in theory, but if there is no employee available to tweak the numbers, it ain't getting done.

and i wold like fw to be alive once again, but this is not a discussion on what you would like to see, but about what it happens and will not change.
---
Nerfing them won't really do anything to curb numbers. They'll just bring more.
---
Titans need to be forced into situations where they can be killed, and tools need to be available that can kill them. Even before this extreme proliferation we're seeing now they weren't dying in near enough quantity. This was still the endgame. We just reached it a lot sooner.
---

Yea, cause the game is really fun and engaging now, you can tell by all the people NOT playing anymore.

Then had its flaws, but now is actual ass.
---
Apparently undervalued by zkill by about 140b (rig build cost).
---
Should have started with double the scale with 48 cm long Providence, right? X) Heh, 28 cm long Macharies would be pretty reasonable though, and that helps making twice as large cruisers much more manageable.
---
Them being the biggest only matters if your only solution to a problem is to N+1 it.  Battleships can be outtracked far better than caps (really fighters mainly), can be bombed and EWAR'd, and would be dependent on logi that's far easier to deal with than triaged FAXes, just for starters.
---
If they don't get on a KM, they don't show up on the BR.
---
There was a few faxes there.
---
Synda brains...
---
tbh i don't know if they had a dedicated team when they nerfed the titans the first time, or the second.. or the third time, but my point is that it's not at all hard to change those numbers, i'm sure they have an interface similar to eft or pyfa where they can edit values for ships.
---
Obviously that's not how you balance a game, but they can take the approach of just nerfing Titans into the ground like they have in the past, and eventually buff it again, like they did it in the past.
---
That's why i'm saying, i don't see anything to worry about it when the value of this ships can be nerfed into the ground the moment that CCP decides that they are actually a detriment to the game.
---
I think much more is needed than tweaking numbers.
---
Did u seriously post this disregarding the breaking news in Detorid?

It was breaking as I was writing and going through edits. The battle from detorid we are in the process of talking to different member groups to get their perspectives and whatnot. I am sure it will be talked about when we go live from EVE North so don't worry it won't go unreported.
---
against me he used acolytes to pull some reactive resists to em and there was no point resetting because he went all in kinetic right from the start (and won).
---
The 1900 report is usually everything up to a day before the report is posted. Am sure it will be mentioned and reported in the next 1900 and its own post. You said it yourself, its breaking news!
---
I has it be benefits, mostly for new players which is great. This subs mostly bitter vets who have their feet sunk in already. Glad you‚Äôre enjoying the game though!
---
Seems accurate. Only when EVE is dead can CCP make more money! (/s)
---
Okay well no need to downvote, just saying
---
Lol? Pretty easy to kill them. They die all the fucking time under the umbrella.
---
I suck at painting models(love assembling them though), but my gf is an artist and promised me to paint some of my models a long time ago. However I yet to see my small Wood Elves collection painted, so there is a queue already x)
---
Honestly, nowadays VNI -&gt; Avatar/Erebus/Ragnarok
---
Yeah and back in 2012/2013 all I can remember is people clamoring for a return to 2008/2009.
---
I mean fuck one of the biggest complaints back in 2012 was that roaming was dead compared to previous years and literally in this OP the guy mentions roaming as a positive of the 2012/2013 era.
---
I think the rational position is that there are things from back then I would want back, and things I wouldn't want back.  And btw the game was dying back then too.
---
Oh and yes I hate the current meta also.
---
Most of the fights were subcaps because if Imperium undocked in anything bigger than cruisers they would get 200 tracking titans dropped on them. Please education yourself.
---
What did they actually expect lol.
---
I don't disagree that nerfing won't curb numbers, but their effectiveness can be drastically reduced with a press of a few buttons on CCP side, my argument is that this isn't a reason to scream "oh my god this is horrible" like some people have been today.
---
They can buff dreads, nerf rorquals, nerf faxes... or better yet,  nuke faxes from the game and nuke remote reps from the game.
---
There are a lot of options available for CCP when it comes to dealing with supers and titans, some that require minimal effort (changing the attributes of ships like titans/dreads/faxes/carriers and supers) and some that will require more effort, designing a new ship to counter the titan blob. 
---
Given the history of  titans, they went from being super Overpowered killing machines that could kill with absolute safety, to pretty much bridging machines for years until CCP not only buffed them with new toys but then went on and gave the rorqual the ability to pump out titans like if they were candy.

---
&gt; I mean you all have had nearly a year to get on closing that gap. What did you do with your time?
---
We did things that people wanted to do. Mining 24 hours a day to produce more titans and guarding the people mining isn't one of those things.
---
Ohh dear I am not surprised at all. üòë
---
&gt; Oh and yes I hate the current meta also
---
Its not the ship meta thats bothersome, its that the game has been reduced to a singular viable play style if you want anything other than living in a wormhole. Its that removing a single fucking structure from space is now a week long episode in stupid, that depending on the size of the structure, only so many people can even participate in. 
---
Oh and skill injectors, thanks for royally fucking the game up with those.
---
In fact of all the shit that I could list that they've fucked up, the ship meta is literally the one I care least about, because since injectors are a thing now, without agile monthly balance passes the game is literally unable to be balanced as people dog pile injectors onto the hot thing.
---
&gt; People can play they way they want as they obviously do.
---
Except NC and PL, who should play the way goons do.
---
Holy fuck you guys need to make up your mind.  A week ago we had 1300 titans on field now were are up to a couple thousand supers and titans. Neither which is correct.  You are paralyzed by fear of a loss and what that will do to your reputation. We have won all 3 large titan/super battles that there have been so any reputation there is to lose has already been lost.  
---
Get your numbers right and quit inflating them to make your point you just come across as an idiot.
---
It didn't help after ya'll left after B-R that the russians totally fell apart.
---
I think we ended up with more space than we started with after "losing" that war.
---
I'm no expert, but losing that many dreads to kill 1 titan just isnt worth it, not even after insurance.
---
What?! Eve is dying! This is breaking news
---
Thank god they are gone. They were obnoxious about their killboard despite being pretty bad at keeping a good killboard anyways.
---
The difference is pl and nc would hold people hostage and force a fight the other side knew they would lose. Fight or we kill this pos, fight or we take all your sov, etc.
---
Maybe bombers will see their glorious return into the meta.
---
God I hope so.
---
Surely you didnt expect to get fights? im not proficient in eve online strategies but i see no way anyone can beat the imperium, so why even bother trying?
---
No.

Old rats are the ones you find in anomalies, missions and on gates and such. The new ones mostly hang out in mining belts and have a diamond prefix in their name. You can also see them on d-scan if you have your d-scan configured to show them.

Before his ban he prolly RMT'd a lot of his isk, he had a lot of it, so he prolly made out pretty big, I doubt he cares about EVE anymore.
---
So in the interest of disclosure I‚Äôm NC.
---
Is this what CCP envisioned? The answer to that is probably maybe but there was a total lack of foresight behind the decision. I think all they saw was empty null sec and that a sure fire way to get filled was to ensure that players would have the ability to make it rich there with less risk than what was then the norm.
---
This was unchecked for far too long hence the N+1000 Titans \[or however many GSF has\]. Now we have a super-capital force unrivaled by any other alliance in game and it totally turns the citadel model on its ass. What‚Äôs the point of having a citadel \[of any type\] when the N+1000 can roll up and stop the repair timer with only a dozen or so of them while the rest twiddles their thumbs waiting for the other Titan blob to show \[here‚Äôs a hint, they won‚Äôt\].
---
I don‚Äôt believe the situation in the Tranquility server is as bad as Serenity got‚Ä¶.yet‚Ä¶.but it‚Äôs certainly heading that way and CCP hasn‚Äôt done anything to stop the train. I get the impression that CCP is paralyzed by the fact that no matter what change they make, they‚Äôre going to lose money as a company because a certain percentage of people will unsub due to nerf on their play style. That‚Äôs probably going to happen but nevertheless let‚Äôs try and find a solution.
---
You can‚Äôt limit titans and or supers. That‚Äôs not fair to their owners who worked hard in their Rorquals to mine them and build/buy them and I honestly don‚Äôt know how much more the Rorqs can be nerfed
---
At Eve Down Under, Hilmar talks about regional ores and how removing them was stupid. I would suggest we go a little farther than that and remove the post-scarcity society that is provided by the endless re-spawning of minerals. Tie in either the re-spawning of minerals or their total daily volume to the number of supercapitals being produced. Another option \[one that might be considered rather cruel to newer players\] would be the requirement for special \[read: Rare\] materials to make super-capitals. This would not eliminate the super-capital problem but rather bottleneck their production. A regional material model could also have the benefit of increasing inter-regional trade. 
---
Something else that could be implemented could be a maintenance penalty for capitals \[maybe just supers and titans? &lt;shrugs&gt;\]. This would operate in a manner similar to fatigue. A ship that files, for whatever reason, will require X many hours of maintenance for Y many hours of flight time. On a side note, applied to sub caps \[it shouldn‚Äôt\] this could eliminate the cloaky camping that many players take issue with. The maintenance would cost similar to repairs \[i.e. free in null if you have the sov\] and the penalties for not conducting it would be reduced performance and/or modules going u/S.
---
I suppose CCP could nerf a Titans tank while at the same time buffing Dreadnought firepower. Changing fuel requirements on DDs to something different and rare to find would make pilots chose to be more frugal with those instruments of destruction.
---
If it sounds like I‚Äôm picking on Titans, I am. N+1000 is the problem and that needs to go away. It‚Äôs removing content and that‚Äôs bad for the game overall. Nobody takes a fight with a 100% chance of defeat. Likewise, nobody will want to undock with a 100% certainty of no content. 
---
I could be totally off base of course. There might be a big blue donut in nullsec this time next year, and schisms will arise and the fighting will start all over again. But then why are the Chinese players coming to Tranquility? I mean, certainly they didn‚Äôt shut down Serenity because of that‚Ä¶..right?
---
I welcome anyone else‚Äôs thoughts on how to solve the issue.
---
&gt;Fuck yeah dude keep doing things you don't enjoy with your spare time!
---
It's a game, not a job.
---
Highsec next? Maybe. Who knows?
---
don't forget the pirate vexor
---
&gt;None of this should lead you to a conclusion that i want off grid links back or i'm against the wardec changes.
---
You want what is good for you. What is good for you is arbitrary. Should what is good for someone else also matter? Why wouldnt we try to look at what is objectively good?
---
Is it established that wormholers should have that safety? How?
---
&gt; that's about 2x my personal net worth
---
&gt; I'm not particularly wealthy
---
Yeah okay, 1,000,000,000,000 is VERY wealthy in EVE, nice humble brag.
---
200 battleships vs 20 tornados and a command destroyer means you can kill battleships without necessarily having to throw away the 20 tornados. There is no subcap or even cap equivalent to this when we look to capitals. Maybe you can jump in a dread group 200km off and maybe you can blap a single dread without siege  (lol)  but your chances of getting away with it and not losing the entire fleet is pretty low. There's a reason people don't harass super fleets unless they plan to escalate or just want some dope fighter kills.
---
Depends if it's a fucking stealth bomber on your ass
---
The game being reduced to a single viable play style is entirely due to the ship meta now that every entity has figured out how to run a proper home defense umbrella.  As usual, it's player strategy progression that has outdated many of the game mechanics, an easy example of this will always be when slowcats were invented using mechanics that had been in the game for years but never applied in that way before.  Player strategies are constantly evolving as we all play competitively and min/max the game, and you're right, without constant balance passes then the min/maxing can become boring.
---
Right now the core issue is that a variety of ship balance factors combine to essentially require a minimum of 50-80 people to counter even the most basically competent alliances, when that was never really the case before.  Skill U and Snuff picked up on this and started expanding their numbers a few years ago as a result, and the wormhole roamers are slowly learning it the hard way.
---
This game always comes down to combat balance.  Everything else organizes itself around combat balance.
---
P.S And yeah I really don't mind skill injectors.  Having had all my brand new super and titan pilots always getting poached by the entities that had the most super and titan pilots because they were the ones that "used their supers and titans", creating this weird catch 22 situation, you're just never going to understand why skill injectors became a thing.

Stop arguing with yourself please.
---
Karma whoring on the eve subreddit is like trying to become a successful Twitch streamer by playing Eve.
---
Is there one for ships overall?
---
You're right nice job. I think the answer is scarcity and weapon system only good vs supers and titans.
---
No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs because they know they‚Äôve got a bigger dick of caps to escalate with and there‚Äôs no chance of being contested.
---
I can remember when undocking a carrier was spooky because you never knew if a few dreads from PL would show up out of nowhere to ruin your day.

HOW DID YOU READ THE EULA AND CONCLUDE "LOOSER" ? 
---
HOW???
---
There is *nothing* "looser" about the EULA's wording or language here.  
---
When it says "you" it means, legally, YOU. as a legal individual in real life.
---
Let me lay this out for you: 
---
1. The above part I bolded in the EULA says you needed to be subscribed (Omega) on each of the accounts that you used for the purpose of simultaneous play.
---
2. You admitted in this thread, outright or implicationally, that you ran an Alpha, owned by you - the legal you - on your home server constantly while playing Omega accounts, owned by you - the legal you - on your main computer.
---
**TLDR:**
---
It does not get any clearer than this. You are absolutely 100% guilty of what you are being accused of. 
---
What you intended is irrelevant, and ignorance is not an excuse. 
---
**Suggestions:**
---
* (A) If you made a genuinely naive mistake / impulsive decision / severe lapse in judgment, get on your knees before CCP and beg their forgiveness. If they refuse, eat the loss and make a new character. 
---
* The fact of the matter is, they are within their right to refuse, because you are, as a person, indistinguishable from...
---
* ... (B) this is yet another beautifully crafted sob story for sympathy. In that case, in the words of Michael Garibaldi of Babylon 5, I suggest you tuck your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye.

Honestly - you couldn't say I want to do exploration now or perhaps incursions now without some graphic box telling you its there?  I'm sure that there are people that need this level of spoon feeding but really should the devs be writing their game towards such a lowest common denominator?  While they may have captured your 15 bucks by continuing their efforts at dumbing down the game, it seems apparent that over the last half dozen years or so, they've chased more people away who wanted a complicated game then they've replaced.  In fact, there was no bump at all from this update and the game still sits at 2007 player numbers.
---
No, fuck 'em, NC and PL both deserve to be ground into a fine powder. For the good of the game, I hope a better grrr goons group emerges from the ashes.

There's zero reason for the imperium to ever go to war against the second largest coalition in the game. It's in their best interests to remain bluetral to each other.

Looks like whlers have some nice fights and fun, nullseccer btw
---
1. How does multi-boxing work? Can you play multiple alts from the same account at once? If not, how do they limit the client?
---
2. I'm intrigued with wormholes and small gangs (unrelated to station trading that will be a different toon) - what options are there? What are wormhole corps like and what are small gangs like? Because I'm starting to realize that I might want some small combat too, and that'll be impossible if I just stay in a big corp from what I've heard.
---
3. The specific null spaces I'm thinking of are Brave Newbies and Karmafleet, how would those work with station trading (i.e not ever leaving the station, so not hauling)?
---
TYSM for all this help!
---
People don't see it that way. Cause a titan is much harder and takes longer to build, while usually (not so much lately) involving the risk for it to get aborted during that long time in build. Plus.. content.
---
can confirm, wormhole fighting is some of the most fun I have had :) I was there for both those wh fights and it was pretty epic ngl.
---
Why do you insist on being willfully wrong about things?
---
My point was mostly if you have proper information what system CCP is using. It seems that you don't. If so your original post are only assumptions.
---
It's sad that CCP doesn't seem to release what voting system they use. But that's not your fault.
---
Regarding gaming the system: again tactical voting is a thing for the CSM. Personally, I won't vote at all this year. Overall I hope the people who are so engaged here put the same effort into real life elections which actually matter.
---
There is? At least for the Vexor.
---
I mean, here's the top 50 for 7d/90d/alltime
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/29988/ranks/
---
Honestly 2016 was the only chance CCP had before they thought it was a good idea not to prepare for the influx of newbies or have a decent tutorial
---
The retards could've fleshed out the alphas THEN take 6 months to make a good npe while making sure the servers could handle afew more thousand before pushing out alphas/Omega.. God damn CCP makes me angry..
---
If I have a low standing with a faction, but enter their space. Will that spaces CONCORD fire on me? Or would it only be ships belonging to the NPC faction that would fire on me?
---
Goons aren't killing the game. They are killing the alliances that evicted them from Deklein.
---
ended up isk positive for Test, coulda fooled me
---
I wasn't a part of the fight but based on the video that I have seen of the S-KSWL fight, I am pretty sure that Skill Urself dropped the Minokawa first and Darkness brought in the dreads shortly afterwards to attempt to kill it.
---
I couldn't agree more. I returned last week for a nose around and the agency window is a huge reason why I'm still logging in. It makes finding stuff to do so easy
---
It's all about wanting to use them. I can't believe you've not been on comms with guys desperate to use a shiny new toy.
---
Dark, thanks for providing the rest of Legacy and Winter the war content we've all been itching for. &lt;3
---
Oh interesting, you have to load a ship and do ranks
---
Thanks! #51 ranks are probably close enough to the bottom
---
To be honest I hope a lot of people. Now injectors are really bad cause they take away from that important achievement which used to be skills (and which required a serious time and focus investment) and allow the "gratification now" people to get in whatever ship they want instantly, but they are good too because they bring immediate (and probably considerable) income to ccp (and we all want them to do well so they can pour resources into eve) and it helps a little with new players mentality as well, knowing they can get at the same level with veterans in no time if they are so inclined. Now the last point is really controversial cause eve skills were always a 2% here 3% there per level so you don't really need to be at the same level (top) with the veterans to still be able to compete.
---
tssss... don't share extended guide for free. Full guide version costs isk
---
So one side fills up a system and the other cant contest, nice
---
Gonna have to disagree with you on this one!
---
Oh okay so you're just making assumptions then?
---
The game hasn't been as CCP envisioned since like 2005 mate
---
Like if I were to liquidate everything - even skills?
---
You can delay supers at gates with smaller ships.
---
Cool )
---
We‚Äôve past the point of no return..
---
I appreciate the banana for reference.
---
I found that checkbox within 2 seconds, knowing there should be one.
---
Thanks anyway...
---
I agree, with a lower limit approach. A fleet can only be formed with at least one supercapital per 10 pilots.
---
Looks like an awesome fight, and a classic eve way to kick it off )
---
Why?
---
Valuing the rigs properly puts the lossmail at ~291 billion isk.
---
IMO  a lot of the issue is that there's no competitive isk making alternative to being in big blocs, and there's almost no small gang content anymore.  Honestly, if bloc warfare was this bad but there were alternatives, it would eventually dwindle because most of us do play for fun.  Plus, there's no going back on supers and caps at this point.
---
But as it is, the game is just too punishing for most small gang players.  There's content out there but you have to be patient, well-funded, supremely skilled, and even then a lot of it is just whaling and ganking.  You're playing that way in spite of the game not because of it, and eventually people say fuck it and go join a blob.
---
That's a lot of words to say "all that matters anymore is raw numbers", but yes in that regard you are correct.  
---
Also there is no "you guys" anymore, haven't been with them in a bit simply because I'm not interested in getting to the size required to compete.  I'll always ride the less friends is better bus.
---
Originally, seeing a titan was a rare sight.
---
Now, seeing a titan is also a rare sight because they usually come in blobs.
---
He's a goon.
---
I m not ccp. But i travel a lot in space. So you can know where is the player.
---
he's trying to get into PL
---
That‚Äôs not necessarily true - you can defensively bubble your battleship fleet against bombs, for ECCM for ewar, and put a remote repair module in the high slot for RR here fleets. Source: been there done that.
---
It comes down to N+1 always, and will be forever, I‚Äôm literally anything anywhere at anytime. The failure of your organization is because more people like goons than they do Horde / NCPL (probably because you guys were shitters to everyone) and you guys can‚Äôt seem to grasp that.
---
&gt; Is the game as CCP envisioned? N+1000 titan fleets dominating the game in the exact path as serenity. 
---
No, but CCP has always been really bad at visualizing the results of their decisions. They made supercaps really good to keep the veteran players with supers subscribed longer, instead of the previous result which was *get titan win eve*.
---
This sucked in different directions for **many** years now, it's just that different groups of people complained about it and were told they're just salty losers. A little while back the current salty losers defended their position on the supercap pyramid with posts like "you want 100 rifters to be able to kill a titan".
---
NC. is statistically more active than Goons. They are undocking and fighting. They just aren't fighting you.
---
I guess if you are only allowed to post mittens approved memes you work with what you can though.
---
goons will bring 500 of them
---
I think it‚Äôs a good thing. It‚Äôs hard to understand all of the different activities in EVE and it‚Äôs nice to have them all in one place
---
Then people will cry about bombers not being bubble immune when we take those Capital pilots and ship them into defensive bubble dictors / hics.
---
You have the brass neck to moan about farming to death. What do you think your alliance contributed to the desolation of lowsec.
---
Before the graphic box was there I'd need to look up how to go about exploring, how to find an incursion, or how to access any of the content really by looking to third party sources.  Call it spoon feeding if you want, but when I get home from an 18 hour shift, the less time spent watching other people's YouTube videos or reading Wiki articles the better.  Besides, I don't think making the content easy to find really qualifies as "writing their game toward the lowest common denominator".  The content is still the same and therefore the same level of difficulty, but now people actually get to know what's there at a glance rather than needing to look up what's even possible.
---
make black ops battleships have some kind of anti cap bomb that has dmg ramp up exponentially sig
---
Are you Gobbins?
---
2-3 years ago people beat us and evicted us, NCPLorde is getting steam rolled bc they pissed everyone off who would have helped them.
---
is there something about this proposed mechanic that you speculate goons will not be able to abuse by n+1ing it
---
Hahahahahaha
---
valuing the rigs on a mogul financial structure of all things at jita buy price for the components is absolutely stupid and you are for posting it
---
I think you‚Äôre equating depth with complexity.
---
Funny cos I remember lots and lots of crying
---
More great fights have begun by fat-fingered-bridging-to-accidental-jumping than anything else in the game iirc
---
it's a public sotiyo, we have our own cap building structures that aren't public and in range of jita and also in high traffic nullsec entry systems
---
without being an utter smoothbrained retard there's really no way you can even pretend those were ncpl titans in build
---
I know man.  There was/is nothing else in eve that even came close to FW at it's peak
---
Fortunately/Unfortunately, the early designers of EVE had very lofty dreams for the future of the game. Epic battles with massive ships, fighting against even more epic and massive fleets and all that. They were apparently willing to skip a few steps to make those dreams reality. What they didn‚Äôt do is follow any kind of logical path of consequences to see where those acts might take them. There is a great irony in creating such a player-driven sandbox, while also assuming players won‚Äôt eventually just do something you specifically gave them the tools to do.
---
Since then capitals have basically existed to feed the emotion, dreams, and nostalgia of devs and players alike. Capitals exist almost entirely for the sake of other capitals. Even before now, they had little purpose other than to deal with structures and be end-game goals for groups and individuals. With a design philosophy of ‚Äúyes, but can it be bigger‚Äù it‚Äôs not surprising that there are so many issues with them.
---
That being said, in an sandbox like EVE, especially being single-shard, there will always be an upward trend. CCP can only do so much to try and slow the growth, but they can‚Äôt turn back the clock.
---
Sort of, it provides a list of the candidates at the top of the page, in the order of the link, but you have to drag them up in order on the first account.  After that it is prefilled in.
---
Hahahaha this ‚ÄúTOO MANY SUPERS AND CAPITALS‚Äù sperg is too entertaining.
---
Wouldm ake for a good april fools for a couple windows.

#NotEvenOurSupersInBuildIPromise
---
Burning down the infrastructure is the op success.
---
Being killboard green is somewhere in the 8 - 10 range on the list of metrics goons care about right now.  They are posting this because they know Panfam cares.
---
Jump dessies weren‚Äôt in the game back then lol
---
Says the guy who‚Äôs obviously never bought salvage in the large enough quantities needed to build Sotiyo rigs. Every time you open your mouth it makes it painfully obviously our ignorant you are at most things you opine on.
---
Should see the massive avatar I've been working on
---
they killed quite a few dreads too (32 and 2 fax).  granted with reduced insurance now and titan hulls like 45b, kind of eh on who "lost" more isk post-insurance - vs. 96 dreads and 1 fax.
---
if that titan had cyno, my guess is this would have been a one sided BR.  my cyno fit:  4 haws, bridge, DD, cyno, smartbomb
---
It was obnoxious then, and is obnoxious now. The person saying it shouldn't matter.
---
JUST BC SOMETHING IS WORTH SOMETHING DOESNT MEAN ITS ACTUALLY WORTH SOMETHING JEEZ
---
you really just aren't grasping the concept of who mogul financial are
---
Let's try this again.
---
CCP likes emergent gameplay. That's a big part of what makes EVE so awesome (the "sandbox" you hear about all the time). As such, much of what we do is stuff that CCP did not *intend*, yet at the same time CCP would like to *support*.
---
There are, of course, also things that we do that CCP did not intend, and which CCP would like to stop. A good example of this is "fozzie claws". Another example is gate sliding.
---
CCP, like any company, wants to do internal testing before releasing their ideas to the public. This is especially true of divisive things like balance changes. CCP can't get that internal feedback from its own people because they aren't experts in the emergent gameplay we do. They can't get that feedback from "the community" as you suggest because the community is not capable of operating under NDA. Instead, CCP asks us to elect a small group of people who represent us and who *can* operate under NDA so that CCP can bounce ideas off of them.
---
It's important to have a variety of emergent gameplay expertise present in the room because CCP doesn't always know what changes will affect what emergent gameplay. So you'll get one of the devs suggesting a fix to one area of space, and it's on the CSM to say "that's great, but \[this other area of space\] also uses that mechanic. Let's make sure the proposed fix doesn't break something you like there".
---
Yeah I have, that‚Äôs been the case for years. However in times gone by there was an appropriate risk with any toys and more often then not it wasn‚Äôt suitable to take that risk. These days the risk factor doesn‚Äôt even exist, and the price of said toys is significantly lower.
---
Maybe back in 2006 that was the case, but nowadays titans are in stockpile waiting to be sold. So no, losing that many dreads for 1 titan is not worth it.
---
My knowledge of Eve is that that freighter is going to be bumped, then suicide ganked by the talos.
---
&gt;there's really no way you can even pretend those were ncpl titans in build without being an utter smoothbrained retard oh wait
---
why am i not surprised at who posted this
---
I have never heard anything racist from anyone who was allowed to remain in horde.  We have a large variety of races and genders.  I have never witnessed anything like you describe.
---
3D artist here. Do you have the models for the nid and hel? If so, what format? I could take a look if the software I used can import the files.
---
Batphone CCP?
---
Minerals I mine myself are free!
---
That‚Äôs crazy you are in Imperium after only 20 days ago you were thinking about returning!
---
Thanks for the write up.
---
And you aren‚Äôt grasping at where the fuck all the salvage in the game is gathered and where it ends up.
---
Fleet: Now we have 10 fleets of 10 supers instead of 1 fleet of 100 supers.
---
System: AYY WE GOT OUR SUPERS IN 420 HOURS BEFORE YOUR SUPERS GF
---
Delete capitals.
---
So who is mogul financial?
---
Inquiring minds want to know!
---
&gt;Not to rain on your parade, I'm sure you understand this game on a deeper level than I. 
---
No he doesn't. The agency is designed to help new players not vets who knows every single mechanic. For that purpose this version of the agency is excellent.
---
So it‚Äôs like world war bee in reverse.
---
Wormholes
---
Damage/Tracking mods in the lows instead of PDSs, deserved to die imo.
---
5-10m per data site is basically a decent rate. However, in Catch, you should occasionally be getting 30-80M relic sites. That is low as a standard rate.
---
&gt; people tend to flock
---
This is the human nature part nullseccers keep parroting at us. We never deny that. We say there can be mechanics that can counterbalance this effect.
---
&gt;  we allow ourselves to be bad at the game.
---
And the game allows you to fill tons of people under your ultra safe krabbing schemes. Perhaps there is something to be done there?
---
This. I really miss the old neocom
---
When all of your space is burning, only a smoothbrain would attempt to build a titan in an NCPL branded structure in a high traffic area.
---
Noooooo, that Perimeter campaign was utter cancer.
---
The rigs are not priced right
---
It was always "raw numbers are all that matter" my friend, number of titan pilots that is.  Didn't matter how good we got a subcaps, I'd still get titans dropped on my head at the end of the day.
---
I just want the old neocom with colors, and the jukebox
---
In 2013 we were already undocked because we were parked in a POS
---
"You're so blinded by hate you cant see past my hypocrisy" followed closely by "but what about those guys over there" is all I'm reading from you. It's more like you saying that we should pay higher taxes because people cheat, while you cheat on your taxes. It's ok though, this is the kind of nonsense I've come to expect from you.
---
Careful, Joe Painter may be in one of those Machariels and start bumping you
---
in low sec, see someone that isnt green/blue if you are in a corp/alliance expect that they will kill you. if you wait 5 minutes to move then it might be too late. or just stick 3 or 4 warpcore stabilisers on your ship
---
That makes it totally ok and not abusive at all then. Thank you for your contribution I have seen the light.
---
Last year one of my corp-mates reran the CSM election using CCP's published data using a dozen or so different STV variants and **nothing changed**. So I'm really not convinced that the details matter as much as you seem to think. I'm not saying I'm opposed to that data getting published. Just saying you're focusing real hard on something that doesn't seem to matter too much.
---
&gt; Regarding gaming the system: again tactical voting is a thing for the CSM. 
---
Citation needed.
---
&gt; Personally, I won't vote at all this year. 
---
&gt; Overall I hope the people who are so engaged here put the same effort into real life elections which actually matter. 
---
You're sneakily implying without actually stating that the CSM elections don't matter. I've seen first-hand that they do, as when CCP fucked up HIC rolling and nobody on the CSM was able to warn them of that obvious-to-any-wormholer side effect. I'm sure there are many other examples around, plus a ton more where the CSM were able to successfully warn CCP about an unexpected negative side effect.
---
I don't remember those kind of complains when they were in the meta.
---
The titans lost in delve are well over a billion too.
---
An attempt to downplay the damage by shifting the scale downwards.  It's a common tool of propaganda.

---
Yeah absolut amazing times. I don't think today is perfect but at least you can kill big ships, Titans still jump when they should bridge. There is a lot of work for CCP but SOV warfare was and is mostly boring.
---
You must be new here. This was not long before the t20 scandal, when BoB directors were extremely chummy with CCP devs, so ... No. No batphones for us. Though to be fair, I expect that the timing of the first Titan nerf was both coincidental and inevitable. Redswarm Federation was just the first group to get wiped by multiple DDs as a regular tactic. It's also coincidental that the nerf hit not long after Goons got their second Titan. Even CCP could see that the ability to DD entire fleets without risking anything was going to lead to a bad place, especially since they were a lot easier to build than CCP thought they'd be. If they hadn't made the change, fleets would have been nothing but Titans and cyno ships.
---
No. The character bazaar is other people buying your characters. The fee for transferring is 1000 plex or $20 USD iirc. A hauler character with 1 million SP isn‚Äôt even worth that. The trader character might barely be worth the transfer fee but people will just train and use injectors to get the exact skills they want instead of buying that character. Even if it did sell the transfer fee would take pretty much all of it. 
---
Then you‚Äôd have to find a PvP character to buy with enough isk from somebody else.
---
Why would any one ever trust PL.  You had the chance to ruin goons during the fountain war.  Instead you took a payout to fuck off.  You literally stole the best FCs test had at the time.  Your alliance has shit all over just about everyone in eve at some point.   Time for you to do some soul searching and either get with the current meta or cancel your subscription.
---
How‚Äôs your space m8?
---
can't we just kill the guy who makes all the new shit always open by default?
---
Then you run right back into the issues of n+1
---
WORMHOLES!! There is far less competition for sites. Every once in a while you get lucky and find a wormhole with 4 to 5 sites in it that have accumulated there.
---
Ive also never been ambushed by a cloaky astero in a wormhole site.
---
You are repeating a point of view that we read many times, but very few of the Imperium seem to understand the responses this argument receives. To wit, many people don't wish to play this way. 
---
Having been a long term combatant against the Goons, I admire what you have achieved in coming back from the defeat in WWB. It's an amazing feat of leadership and adapting to the current meta. I can't begrudge you your current victories, it's earned. However, CCP have created the situation where for me, someone who hates ratting and PvE, my choice is not to become part of an industrial powerhouse trying to match the Imperium (and which, as you correctly argue later in your post, will only be smashed by the Goons the moment they show up as a possible threat) but to stop playing.
---
I was at the fall of the first Keepstar in M-0EE8. All of the wonderful comrades I had during that epic time have left the game. It has come full circle, and I have to face the fact that a farmville game has little to no pleasure in it for me. Faction Warfare is also so broken that there is little attraction, and anyway, I have no doubt that Goons will, as they become more bored, try the Viceroy thing again and start dropping on FW fights as other bored nullsec powers are doing already. 
---
You should be proud of what the Imperium has achieved, especially if you were one of those who fought in WWB and stayed to build back up. You were worthy enemies then, and proud victors now. 
---
However, I like subcaps. I like PvP. I don't want to rat and mine. EvE is not likely to be enjoyable for me if that is the only path open.
---
If something is too small, it's time to make the scale larger. I want a ship to take up your entire front lawn
---
I argue capital ships are OP. Should I refrain from using them too?
---
You are laughable mate. Keep giving us hilarious content.
---
N+1 will always be a thing to some extent whether you like it or not. But there should at least be tools that you can use to fight a larger force, if you're good/smart enough.
---
The only thing that can beat a titan blob is more titans. There are multiple answers to a battleship blob. More battleships is only one.
---
That's a you problem.
---
toasty
---
Allowing members to be bad leads to fights and generates content. Demanding elietness leads to risk aversion and removal of content.
---
I've tried playing on both sides, and a fight between bad players is infinitely more fun than a fight between players trying to be elite.
---
Do we slow  clap now?
---
Faux is pronounced like 'Fo', the X is silent, hence the Fax is more commonly used as phonetically it makes more sense.
---
who do you think builds supercapitals in a public sotiyo in the first place?
---
I said "Looser" because the article specifically calls out on a single machine where the EULA doesn't.  Sorry for trying to get confirmation from CCP that it is indeed an abuse to log in on multiple machines (since that is what their posted article says) and not just on a single machine.  I figured that might make it so someone else in the future does not have this issue even if it doesn't change my own.
---
And indeed I did say I had logged in on a separate computer as an Alpha while I played on my main computer with my Omega accounts, never disputed that.  I posted this because I wanted to know how long it generally took for CCP to respond to tickets so I could know the reasoning behind my ban.  
---
And as you mentioned ignorance is no excuse.  I know, I agree.  I just want to know what I was ignorant of (from CCP and not speculation)
---
So you're saying that if everyone banded together they'd have enough to beat the imperium? The numbers strongly suggest otherwise. Whereas 2-3 years ago if everyone banded together to beat ncpl that could have been done pretty easily.

I think you forgot B-R when NC PL lost far more titans than the other side.  NCPL 72, goons+ friends 143.  Uh huh.
---
&gt;it's a public sotiyo, **we have** our own cap building structures that aren't public and in range of jita and also in high traffic nullsec entry systems             
---
&gt;there's really no way you can even pretend those were ncpl titans in build without being an utter smoothbrained retard oh wait        
---
/u/tuz please kill more of this NCPL  "public" stuff
---
Skill injectors are really at fault here, nothing else. Anyone can inject into a titan today.
---
So you ignored the issue. How about we rename "emergent" to "exploitative"? Do we still support it? Doubt it. This is the problem with arbitrary design. You just want what is good for you.
---
&gt;They can't get that feedback from "the community" as you suggest because the community is not capable of operating under NDA.
---
Yes they can, the only problem is people who argue in bad faith for things that benefit them but might be bad for the game, but these can be filtered. The NDA is basically a joke in terms of necessity as far as I can tell. CCP obviously doesnt care about some players having an unfair advantage as there are probably at least 2-3000 bots running right now.
---
The fact that you want to exclude the community is another reason why one should suspect you just want what you want. You think the chance is greater if it happens behind the scenes. Pretty dishonest.
---
&gt;and it's on the CSM to say "that's great, but [this other area of space] also uses that mechanic. 
---
Community should do that.
---
&gt;Let's make sure the proposed fix doesn't break something you like there".
---
In this particular case, we have not established you should have that ability. You dont want people who may disagree with you to have a voice regardless of the quality of their argument.
---
[an eve financial services group,](https://www.eve-mogul.com/) i think the main dudes are jeronica and john selth. they sell customized market spreadsheets and consultations etc etc, plus they have a few public structures here and there
---
as far as personal wealth for these guys, i'd probably put them on par with aryth in terms of "i can't even be bothered to count the number of zeroes on my net worth"
---
the important takeaway here is that these are experienced marketeers and people who've made their fortunes speculating on the market. i imagine the salvage for those rigs was collected in a stockpile by buy orders that went up around the time the component requirements for building citadel rigs was announced in a dev blog, if not before, so current jita sell prices are a really dumb way to approximate what was paid for them
---
and if the argument is "well that's the cost they'd have to pay to replace them from jita" the counter question is, how do you know they don't have that much salvage just laying around?
---
But now PH will have to join to clean the area from "non-higsec-trade-pact" structures.
---
what exactly is your point?
---
if you just wanted to reiterate how dumb you are, you could have spent less effort making that point
---
They won't have any titans, because we'll kill them all. Then we'll all die in our 50 fancy expencive titan-killing black-ops to 1000 of goons in trash-ships, aka feroxes or ishtars or whatever crap people fly in null nowadays.

It will make subcaps relevant in big wars, also dog-pilling supers on a grid (or single cyno) would be suicide. People might actually have to use caution and decision making, instead of pile more supers and win. Caps would have to be used more strategically and tactically. Excellent planning, piloting, and execution could actually win outnumbered. The opposite of N+1000. 
---
      Also, the umbrella wouldn't be so strong if a handful of caps doesn't make a fleet of subcaps irrelevant. We need something that can be a real threat to them that can roam.
---
We don't need more mechanics that encourage each individual to have 900 SP farm accounts.
---
Why would anyone share their market niche with you? If you can't figure it out, just grind with a Super or Rorqs.
---
What are you going to use it for
---
You can only find pirate sites in c1-c3. However all c4-c6 holes eventually go through c1-c3 to reach known space so dont be afraid to use a high class wormhole to find other holes connected to it.
---
Any wormhole with a highsec static is likely to have been found already and cleared out. The more remote you can go the better.
---
The best idea for example is to scan from highsec find a low class hole. Use that hole to go to a high class hole then use the highclass hole to find low class holes again.
---
are you dumb?
---
There are tools and strategies and etc etc but I‚Äôm not gonna discuss them further.
---
There are also these things called stealth bombers for subcap blobs.
---
You don't really make isk om sp farms atm
---
Still intact
---
Diminishing returns.  Each super in a system reduces the EHP of all other supers in that system by an increasing percentage.

I'm not a part of any nullsec group.

Yes.
---
Your argument is dumb.
---
No doctor, tackle, logi?!?!? Brave man you are. Very cool.
---
&gt; People might actually have to use caution and decision making
---
most of the time super fleets are used, it's with an extreme amount of calculation and strategy beforehand to make sure it's a good decision to do so, and how to do so effectively
---
if you don't think that, it's probably because you've never been in a super fleet

---
&gt; That‚Äôs not necessarily true - you can defensively bubble your battleship fleet against bombs, fit ECCM for ewar, and put a remote repair module in the high slot for RR here fleets. Source: been there done that.
---
As opposed to supers and caps, where there's simply no such thing as a capital bomb threat, EWAR immune or resistant right out of the box, and near-perfect reps until the FAX train runs out? The battleship fleet has to undertake actual counterplay and can't just throw more BS at any problem?  That's the very definition of not being N+1 gameplay.  Yes, having more bodies to fill roles still helps, and it should, but it's not simply a matter of the larger blob always wins like it is with capitals and up.
---
Dude, don't ruin it

Print any Titan then, it would 2 meters long with this scale x) Or Citadel... with the size of the house...
---
So, Hotel Citadel when?
---
Accidentally jumped instead of warp 0 on a gate that I knew was likely camped on the other side. Was going to send my scout over to check but Welp. 800M gone.
---
People's particular management philosophies are completely irrelevant from what I'm talking about. Do whatever you want. 
---
If the game itself allows access to high reward with no creativity, skill, talent of a sort and does it totally risk-free, then the game is designed badly.
---
Basically if bad players are allowed to earn high rewards with 0 risk in ares of the game that's supposed to be risky, then we got a problem.
---
There is a reason why most people we kill in Delve are plebs. Because most people in Delve are plebs. And vocal Goons are the first to bash/disown them when they die. So why don't we talk about what these players are doing in nullsec farming titans and supers with 4 months of Eve nullsec experience and utter carelessness? Some of them are even live streaming. Doesn't this point to something wrong with the game? Isn't this game supposed to be like high skill X high risk = high reward?
---
If you can give me 50 billion ISK, I can double it for you.
---
There is a possibility. Chinese will keep coming, slowly making money, and in a few years goons will be fighting back to back with panfam in a hopeless battle for survivals against the vastly superior chinese hordes. The war would take a few more years due to the very deep pockets of the old players, but in the end it will be all for nought. On the bright side we all be past our 40s or even 50s by then, and at least our wifes and kids will be happy to finally see us in reality more often than they do now.
---
Smoothbrains, so therefore, you and your ilk
---
I was looking at who was jumping in as the rag was eating shit, in the video - not the BR.
---
What the fuck did I just walk into?
---
Why are you still a goon pet? You were once a man....
---
Numbers fielded.
---
The cycle is complete
---
True of course, but they almost always are clumped in one big pile. I'm saying make that clumping a vulnerability. Also, when a group like Goons knows they have the overwhelming cap superiority, they can throw their cap blob at people with a lot less caution, this will get much worse eventually.
---
&gt;Perhaps there is something to be done there?
---
Yeah, there is. For certain groups to realise the only way to rival certain other groups, is to start mimicing them instead of bitching on reddit.
---
Shhhh!
---
I'll buy legible neocom bar
---
i'm just looking for a point in the right direction really
---
Exactly this.
---
This isn't dropping on frigates in Delve, but when away from home, a TON of thought and planning goes into using the big toys.
---
Oh damn the tutorial I made was good enough for someone *else* to share?
---
&gt;thinks I'm in snuff
---
i guess with eve i've just always assumed the guy next to me has got it all figured out and i'm just a fool in the dark trying to find my way
---
yes...obviously
---
Yeah, surely people don't tend to avoid uptight cunts.
---
Good kill, good vid.
---
Also important: EQ is in hyper-inflation mode since they gave up on industry or economic management. So it's easy enough to just throw ISK into plex, wait a year, and magically have substantively more ISK.

*QUITTING EVE FIRE SALE EASY CASH NOW HANGER CLEARANCE SALE 4.1B PROFIT*

Yeah, it is. From the small gang player perspective, it's really good right now. 
---
Your post was pretty weird to read because the state of capitals, sov and structures from 2009-2013 drove me personally out of that gameplay -- it was horrible. It qll boiled down to an n+1 equation in who would win fights. Boring as heck to grind pos' down too. I think we've lost a lot of good players (content) forever. 
---
If you want an illustration on how shit POS were, and are, try flying around with dscan on "all". There's a ton of abandoned pos with guns, hardeners and no force field. No one can be fucked to grind the HP down for no return. It's a waste of hours.
---
All of the above boiled down to money. You needed to be rich and well populated to get a foothold, or a top heavy group would come past with their dread bomb and level your infrastructure. This also equated to overly expansive dominions who were thin in population fighting over moons. This is far less common now and null is more populated than it was ever before.

PL teleporting across the galaxy to third party on every fight was not fun. I miss the rest of it though.

2019 Noobs in titans online is fucking awful.

If I was the best at exploiting some broken mechanics in Eve, I too would blame others about not exploiting them. Particularly there is only 1 slot in the game for any null bloc to do so.
---
These are the same parroted arguments I've been deealing with for over 3 years now. "Bring your own capitals". "Do the same we are doing". "Use your own umbrella". You are drinking too much koolaid mate. Your leaders even admit all the tactical bullshit you as a linemember are being spoonfed. Start using your own brain.

This is probably what triglavian ships should have been.
---
1- You can start a single character from multiple omega accounts all at once. If you try to log in with another alpha account, the game will stop at the log in screen.
---
2- So for wormholes and small-gang focused corps, there isn't 1 I can recommend over the others because they usually fall into the small-medium sized corp (anywhere from 20-200 people). It isn't as easy as saying "go with Brave or Karmafleet". Small gang combat is definitely possible if you're part of Brave or Karmafleet, it's just that you tend to be far from the areas where that kind of fighting happens. Lowsec is the king of solo and small-gang warfare at the moment and you sometimes have to go through dangerous space to get there from null. Lowsec is also unfortunately far less populated than it used to.
---
You can also do small gang in null, there's just a bigger chance that you get dunked by a medium-large gang and get blowned up in seconds. Small gang is very different because each member has a big impact on the fight. You need to have a good knowledge of the game, to know which fights to take and how to take them. If you go do something stupid, you might doom your whole fleet. What happens in large fleets is that you have a fleet commander that takes care of the pre-fight (which fights to take and how) and what actions to take during combat. There isn't as much strategy done by individual members (which you sometimes see referred to as F1 monkeys, since all they do is press F1, the usual shortcut to fire your guns) during a big fleet fight. Small gang fights are more stimulating and interesting, but they also do require a lot more effort.
---
For wormholes, I am a wormholer, so I will be biased in saying that I think that wormholes are currently Eve at its best. You are not shown in local automatically, so you never know if there's someone else in the hole with you. Capital-sized+ ships are really not as present, so the fights are usually pretty balanced. Sometimes in null, your fleet gets jumped by a bunch of caps and might blow up your whole fleet. This doesn't happen in wormholes. A downside of wormholes is that you constantly have to be scanning down signatures which can be a pain. Fights are usually small-medium in size because wormhole mechanics make it harder to form big corporations. Killing a citadel makes them release all of their contents so they become big loot pinatas.
---
3- I'm not 100% sure if one is better than the other. The 2 of the biggest null trade hubs (seen in the chart I posted , null stations are the ones with a bunch of letters, numbers and dashes in them. Like A1-AUH) are in the Legacy Coallition (3L-Y9M and A1-AUH), a coalition of allies that includes Brave. Karma fleet is part of the biggest alliance, the Goonswarm Federation, so you get big markets there as well. You can probably do some station trading, but I'm not sure if your main station will be close or not to the main market, I've never been part of Goons or Brave.
---
I think you're right that injectors are one of the issues that is required to change to fix the current problems, but its not the only one IMO. Removing injectors today still leaves massive fleets of titans and pilots who can fly them, stopping the problem from growing but not fixing it. That needs to be done next to fixes to infinite resources, citadels, and the safety or resource harvesting.
---
Most of the high end guys it is market based activities and production. Skill farms are not that profitable.
---
Cruiser abyssals are a huge waste of time because you're literally getting 3x as much from frigates in the same amount of time, and the frigate setups are MUCH cheaper.  In true CCP fashion, they totally broke balance with the iteration.
---
&gt; We don't want our opponents to quit. We want fights. Curbstomping some that's already unconcious is not a fight.
---
You made some good points but this right here is bullshit. Panfam has often curbstomped weaker groups like Brave over and over. So many new players quit because they were being farmed without a real chance to fight back. This is the "PVP" your group is famous for and they didn't change. They tried again to evict TEST last time, hoping is was an easy curbstomp.
---
Here in my hangar, just bought this new titan here. It‚Äôs fun to drive up here in the nullsec space. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I‚Äôm a lot more proud of these seven new googledocs accounts that I had to get made to hold two thousand new spreadsheets that I downloaded. It‚Äôs like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, ‚Äúthe more you learn, the more you earn.‚Äù
---
They're literally the same sites except they drop 3x as much loot.
---
Sure bud.
---
Like the rolling hic change was never about farm holes or safety like how can you not get that by now ? 
---
This has been pointed out over and over again, it was about the fact that rolling holes is what most groups do to find fights if you can no longer roll holes groups will no longer be around looking for fights.
---
It's not like they were given ample warning and time either. But they kept their heads in the sand because "we just kicked goonie ass, they will never recover". And now their crying continues to keep my fries extra salty.
---
uh that feel when you land on the loki in a hacate, awesome
---
I'm sure that's something you have an intimate understanding of, given your posting.
---
isn't that what essentially goons are doing? fight of we kill your stuff
---
Good stuff, Ill keep this in mind next time my daughter asks to see r/eve.
---
&gt; completely within the nature of the game,
---
Neither being able to fit 100k accounts under the same umbrella nor being able to instantly help any alliance member with a centrally positioned super/titan group is a "natural", unquestionable, unchangeable mechanic in this game. Try harder mate.
---
I've had a phase when I was mainly flying logi and eventually became one of the main logi anchors for my corp.
---
The #1 thing, not only for anchoring but for any independent role is grid awareness. I don't have any specific tips on that, it's just something that most people learn over time (or don't). Always keep track of your position, your fleet's position, their fleet's (or fleets') positions and any ships that are flying around on their own. Sounds hard, but if you always keep trying to be aware, at some point you'll just be intuitively aware without thinking about it too much.
---
Being aware of what's happening on the grid allows you to do #2: Don't react, anticipate. You see an enemy interceptor burning a ping that's a potential warp-in on your logi wing? Position yourself in a way that if the enemy fleet warps to that you're not completely exposed. You see the enemy fleet burn toward your DPS wing? Assuming your DPS have longer range, your FC is probably going to turn around and go away from them. Enemy fleet is breaking and about to bail? Start moving closer so you can be repping your tackle as they go in.
---
Of course, anticipating anyone's actions requires you to know your FC very well. Most of the time in a fight the FC doesn't have time to explain his plans and options. But when I fly under an FC long enough, I usually pick up their habits and learn to read between the lines so to say. 
---
If you manage to keep all these things in your head, the grid, the capabilities of both fleets and your FCs mindset, you'll spend much more time actually moving somewhere useful and much less time over-correcting because something moved in an unexpected way and you have to react.
---
But like I said, this isn't something easily learned. Most of what I described is what I do intuitively on like a subconcious level because I put way too much time into this dumb game.
---
There's a lot of variables to consider I guess.  Are the logi slower than the DPS and your FC wants to push into a brawl? Does the FC want to sit back at range.  Are you set up on a gate.  Are you in null/low/high/WH space.  There's too much to list.
---
What I tend to do is lock up the FC immediately to keep a range check.  Sit around mid optimal for the reps and put the DPS between the logi and the bad guys, being aware of warp ins.  I need to also keep moving so keeping at range isn't an option.  I guess my preferred position if possible is directly below the DPS and clicking in space to create a flat circle around 10km in diameter to at least give me some transversal if we need it.  Just depends what we're fighting.  And I'll remind the FC I'm not a fucking mind reader so let me know if they're going to push into the baddies in advance.  
---
Also depends what logi ship you're in, size of engagement etc, cap chains etc etc.  
---
Just go balls deep, at least you're aware of keeping a decent range, do you'll work it out!
---
Obviously the one with scorch marks from combat, pff, you even trying?
---
Hah, Super related
---
tactical feed
---
In my opinion, the answer is wormholes. No sov related mechanics do no endless farming of anoms. No supers.

That's a shame. It would be great to hide in anoms when neuts come in, let them attack you, and have a whole rat fleet rep you and defend you to their last breath.
---
It's a bad name. Exterminatus is scouring the planet to ash so that nothing can ever live there, preventing heresy from ever taking root again.

Goons are killing buildings that are going to reappear as soon as they fuck of. They haven't exterminated anything.
---
Mobile format, so meh, shitty formatting skills. 
---
Here's some basics for logi anchoring. Want more info, mail me in game under my reddit name.
---
In a brawl off 100 v 100 as an example, you wanna manoeuvre to keep your dps fleet between you and them, optimally, about 30-40km off. Shorten range if your links are limited in range. 
---
Never stop checking the fleets anchor direction, you dont wanna fly in opposite directions. (Bad things happen)
---
If you own the grid and a fight is gonna happen, drop range to 10km so you can burn away in any direction if the enemy ping onto the logi at 0km.
---
Also, manoeuvre to a good positioning away from where they might land if they're not ongrid yet if at all possible.
---
It can happen where enemy fleet catches the logi and you get caught, burn a straight line through your dps fleet to the other side, they're anchoring on you at this point, and if you fly through your fleet, your fleet catches them. 
---
If your fleet gets booshed in multiple directions, have all logi burn towards the biggest cluster of your dps fleet, if three guys are caught elsewhere, your 60 dps guys are more important in saving. Many saved &gt; few saved.
---
If the dps is split and you cant save the multiple people being shot, make decisions, save the more important people and sacrifice those who's losses you can suffer without great consequence. 
---
Watch your logi, if they burning off, on wrong anchor, call them back. Dont be afraid to speak up.
---
Above all, if your main fc is getting tunnel vision and not seeing your losses, SPEAK THE FUCK UP AND TELL THEM YOU ARE NOT HOLDING. At this point, your fc should either get the fleet out or call in triage to help. 
---
In larger nullsec fights, have a hic anchor on the logi ball and give them all your drones, they can catch booshers and your drones will murder the booshers. Saves your dps fleet having to deal with them. 
---
These points can scale from medium to large fights, small gang stuff have different rules. Also, delegate, in larger fights, pass off priority calls to someone else and they can call who needs the reps most, or even have them watching the logi ball and callout anyone not on correct anchor and watch the logi chat if people call out they're not getting correct cap. 
---
If you are in a massive tidi blob fest and wanna swap anchors so you can take a quick break, dont fallout an anchor change, just anchor yourself on them and let them take over. Once you're back, they anchor back on you, and you continue on.
---
Now, these are my tips, other may have different ideas, may argue, but it's how I've found I like to logi anchor, been doing it for about 3 years at this point, and have found that in different situations, you're gonna break your golden rules, cause no 2 fights are the same.
---
Their tears are the fuel by which my sov laz0rs fire
---
Our 100k accounts fit nicely into a tight region. Those 146k accounts are what makes us strong. It's completely natural for an alliance with 274k accounts to take the route most profitable.

This could not have come at a better time.
---
Oh yeah. I spent few months in panfam. Uptight cunts got really familiar.

I'm just wondering what Triglavian music sounds like.

And that all results in them being used whenever folks can.

Are there places to go where perhaps getting 100M+ sights is feasible or is that nor really a thing?

1. So basically, max 1 alpha character per PC? Or max 0 or you can do 1 alpha if only 1 char and no omega?
---
2. Wormholing things:
---
   1. If you're a wormholer, how come you can't recommend a corp? I'm interested in corps in the triple digits at any ranges, because I want to simultaneously feel like there is a large community, and be recognized by people and make friends and have an impact.
---
   2. What do I need to have to start wormholing?
---
   3. I'm mostly interested in wormhole corps now in terms of combat as they seem very interesting.
---
   4. If you can't recommend a corp, where should I find a wormhole corp that will be pretty large and pretty good?
---
   5. Anything else I need to know about wormholes?
---
3.  I'll probably join Brave Newbies anyways as my application is taking a while for Karmafleet and I've heard bad things about Karmafleet not accepting toons with alts outside of Karmafleet.
---
I just wish they added those to other factions too. I love love love police themes but hate flying gallente ships, fuck me right???
---
it's a shame ccp let that economist guy go, that seems like sensible straight forward advice though thank you.
---
for some reason my brain reads this as a slaps roof of car meme.
---
I have (rarely) hit 100M in catch or a wormhole with a sansha relic spawn.  So it is possible.  The occasional crystal quarry or science outpost. Even sometimes a temple.  But for the most part 30-70 is a good range, with the occasional 10 or 20.
---

I looked up the logs, it was throwing light missiles at me, oh well, at least the thing I was defending got away, it was worth 3x my t3d and that's why I was there, so mission successful.
---
Yes and Yes.
---
What does that even mean?
---
oof.......
---
I'm not a market tycoon by any means, in fact, you seem to have more knowledge and experience than me. I'll extrapolate being a "professional" at Eve economy to being a professional in other areas though.
---
First of all, they probably don't rely on "this one new cool trick Jita jockeys hate!!!", it's more they've learned enough to generally have a couple decent paying ideas/niches always, and will occasionally predict or stumble upon golden gooses once in awhile.
---
You want the right direction? Time and effort. Seriously, it's literally the same across the board, whether you want to do InfoSec, Horticulture, Artistry, really just anything. Those people who "really" have it figured out? Couple things about them.
---
1. They enjoy what they do. This means they're self-motivated, and don't really consider it a second job like a lot of us feel sometimes. Not saying never, but it helps out a TON when you actually enjoy the time spent "working", instead of just being motivated by pure money. You gotta look at it like solving a really complex puzzle or something, not just getting more medieval bitcoin, y'know?
---
2. An absolute shitton of TIME. Not the magazine, but they've spent a ton of time. With time comes experience, with experience comes knowledge, with enough knowledge comes mastery. It's not that these guys are just guessing the market, flipping coins and such. You can get rich doing that, but really only once. To sustain a  healthy fat wallet, you seriously gotta know what you're doing to some extent. These dudes with irresponsible amounts of money probably weigh a lot of risk assessment and current knowledge of the game, it's economy, and the patterns associated in order to not sustain heavy financial losses from bad guesses or decisions.
---
3. Pay the fuck attention, question everything. You'll never learn if you're just flipping coins at the market. Make a plan, have *good* reasons for making your decision. Play devils advocate, assume everything goes wrong, can you still afford this loss? If you can pass those, then go ahead, try it out. After every failure, ask yourself a few questions
---
   - What was the winning move for me in the scenario (sometimes, you only win by not playing, remember that)?
---
   - What did I do wrong? Did I assume something I shouldn't have? Was I too hasty? Did I base my decision off of some outdated or flat out incorrect information?
---
   - What will I do next time to assure this scenario doesn't repeat itself?
---
   - When you win, ask yourself a few questions as well, like how could this have gone bad? Where would I be then? etc.
---
If you don't take an active role when you're playing the market (not just pulling the lever and dealing with the results), you'll actually learn quite fast. Sometimes you can never learn anything just by pulling the lever. You HAVE to take an active role when you're trying something new like playing the markets, or making billions of online medieval bitcoin, otherwise, you'll just keep making the same mistakes without reaching your full potential.
---
Hope this helps, like I said, I'm not making billions of ISK, but it's a good method to apply to anything you're attempting to learn.
---
Add target-able sub-systems to caps and maintenance \[so electronic parts for instance\] to keep them flyable. Add a docking array structure for caps for that authentic Pearl Harbour moment and make sure they cannot dock in stations anymore. Wormhole weapon that can suck caps into it and expel them into some random wormhole system.
---
More controversial, CCP should stop them being built until they can actually be bothered to balance them, then there really will be less caps for the time being. The CSM have been generally useless in actually getting anything done about it since at least 2010 so don't rely on them to do anything especially when many of them rely on proliferation to keep their power in-game.
---
Better control of windows and fps/resource throttling for background clients.
---
Not if they're cynod in you can't
---
To add on to the other answers that basically said "Not usually, but sometimes the FC does go alphabetically", they sometimes go alphabetically backwards too.  So starting with Z isn't best either.
---
Aim for about 3/4th of the way through the alphabet.
---
Also, make your name *a little* hard to pronounce.  Not so impossible that the FC immediately uses an initial, and also not so easy that they can just say it.  If they start taking a second to parse your name, and you're not in a special ship they really want to kill, they're more likely to think "fuck it" and call another DPS with an easier name.
---
I really hope when you say "live from eve north" that it dosent mean people have to sit through some shitty stream/podcast/video...
---
It was a great thing while it lasted, thanks to all who supported it with your business.
---
Unlike when you nerds Casino War'd us we don't want to you to stop playing the game....we're just paying you back for old time's sake, nerd.  Also, it should be exterminatus or whatever because it sounds cool...
---
And it's a mobile game, which will replace all current games involved with this joke? I mean, let's not limit ourselves here, we can do more damage than just one game right?
---
not a bad idea, if you vote me onto the CSM I will raise it
---
To fighting a titan blob? Other than not...fighting the titan blob there really isn't.
---
the 'fun' bit that nobody is talking about really is the more bluetral eve becomes the more plex prices will increase as more people crab their safe space for isk to play for free. More people go to safe null to play for free.... 
---
People have mentioned this but it isn't gettignore through to... anybody
---
Haha I was trying to bait that dude for so long last week but he wasn't biting. Gj!
---
True but 4 stabs Will help a lot in the beginning if he gets pointed.
---
If bubble do this : overheat/mwd/cloak and change direction.
---
Win win
---
I could actually check to see who was building the titans if I went through the logs of wallet transactions. Could be funny to see who lost them.
---

Step 1. Credit card    
---
Step 2. Tell everyone you are a market trading genius, but can't reveal your secrets.    
---
Step 3. ???    
---
Step 4. Networth
---
Uh, have you tried jamming something with it's NSA on
---
I know you're saying that to be like "ha ha what a hypocrite" but that is unironically the point that should be made. 
---
When a super weapon that was pretty much designed to only exist in small numbers then becomes exploited and proliferated you basically remove the balance of quantity vs quality and mess up the entire ecosystem of the game.
---
Fundamental issue with EVE's balance though, since being "elite" in anything besides small gang has absolutely nothing to do with knowledge or skill, it's all just how long you've been subbed and how much money you have. Game dug its own grave really.
---
Lock up your fc and click on his portrait. This will make two arrows appear. One arrow will be in front of his ship and the other will be in front of your ship.  The fc‚Äôs arrow that is in front of your ship will be dull and brighten slightly as to distinguish from your own arrow. 
---
Pay attention to these arrows. They will tell you the direction of travel for you and your fc.  The arrows can easily show you of sudden directional changes of the fc. As well as speed changes.
---
The arrow for the fc will lengthen if their speed increases and shorten of their speed decreases. 
---
Note: if your fc is in a cluster fuck of a ball of ships and you are having difficulty keeping track of the fc‚Äôs movement by watching the ships you can keep track of the movements by arrows alone. It isn‚Äôt optimal of course but at least you will have a sense for where the ship is and the direction of travel.
---
You have accused me of wanting what is good for me, and of arguing in bad faith. Fine. I think you're wrong, and I'm happy to take on the responsibility of demonstrating that. My primary source of income is MJD Rattlesnakes in a bearhole, using Astrahus drifter farming. If asked by CCP, I would tell them that I think bearholes are bad for the game, and that the ability of Astrahuses to farm drifters is bad for the game, and that the ability of Rattles and Nestors to MJD freely out of C5 anoms is bad for the game. I think the game benefits from an increased number of ships in space, and an increased number of explosions, including when those explosions are my own ships getting ganked. I have in the past actively advocated for introducing death clones to w-space, something which I'm told will result in the destruction of my group and groups like mine by k-space entities. As I still think this is an improvement for the game, I still advocate it in spite of that "side effect". Would you like more?
---
As for the rest, please show me that you understand the difference between "emergent" and "exploitative", and please show me that you know what an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is.
---
Who wants to shoot a coalition that won't even fight to begin with? You actually want to kill off groups in eve? Damn dude realize this is a game. If they break off on their own it's what ever, but to go in and kill off a group that's already sent packing and running? That's cold and not in the spirit of eve. Did I ever say goons were exclusive to the method of building a massive empire? I'm pretty sure I never did. I'm VERY happy that everyone is not like you yet, you know how FUCKING BORING this game would be if that was the case? 
---
Mad I'm not on the same level? I'm sorry that most of eve are not high-sec care bears. Not all of us want to mine with 20+ rorqs or even rorq mine to begin with. hell you'd never see a lot of mine to begin with. We don't want to create a massive blue donut. We actually want to have fun shooting ships and not structures. Imperium is not the only guilty one obviously, but the reality is that you're the largest blue donut. Do you think most sane people actually want to deal with fozzie cancer sov? Of course the 'empire builders' are okay with it, because you will just use your throw away's to get the job done. 
---
There it goes again, those dumb idiots deserve it! Do you understand what you're saying? You fostered these 'idiots'. They are YOUR coalition members, you accepted them into your group. You spoon feed them content, you spoon feed them the mining anomalies. You spoon feed them the supers. Then when they die, it's their fault? Lol wut? If you actually kicked those people, or even better DENY them to begin with, you'd never have that problem. Is it our fault you accepted low tier members? Wait, that means that you would have LESS people, and that would mean LESS opportunities to exploit them. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see that. If you're not exploiting them, you're effectively and knowingly raising reetards, then when people make fun of them, you act like they're not YOUR reetards.
---
Kudos to you for having fun, if you like propagating the blue donut and kill the server even more, please just flaunt those supers around. If CCP ever got the shit together and ACTUALLY broke up all these massive empires, then maybe this game has a chance to survive. Until then, the Imperium (and all those megablob groups) are all part of the issue, you, being the worst part of the equation.
---
[I'll sell you his corpse.](https://i.imgur.com/KY3ovq6.png) Then you can really be bigtime.
---
It hasnt even been discussed.
---
Any of the four T1 exploration frigates is pretty good, although I'm a bit against the Imicus because I think it's hideous. (Shoutout though to this one guy who called it the 'piano kickstand', that description is adorable.) The Astero is also great even if you can't cloak because it gets a fixed 37.5% scan strength, rather than the +7.5%/lvl (which you can't get up to the full 37.5% because Alphas can't train Frigate V). Bit more expensive though.
---
The Sunesis also gets that scan bonus, and it has an amazing cargo bay (600m3 base??), plenty of mid slots, and can easily be reduced to a &lt;2s align time (which is why I use them as cheap pseudo blockade runners); however it doesn't get the bonus to Virus Strength for hacking modules which hurts it quite a bit as an explorer.
---
Going in another direction though, if you get really really really confident in your ability to escape danger, rather than proposing a ship I'm going to propose a module: Frostline 'Clavicula' Integrated Analyzer. A Data hacker and a Relic hacker in one module, with deceptively more powerful stats than either on its own. (On paper, its Coherence is terrible. But what it doesn't tell you is that it gets bonuses from *both* Data and Relic hacking bonuses, meaning that with 3/3 skills and on an explo frigate, it actually gets 86 Coherence and *36* Strength.) The problem is that the module is around 100mil, and that price will only go up because limited supply, so only get one if you're really really sure of yourself. But if you are really really sure of yourself, hot damn the Integrated Analyzers are amazing.
---
The game that ccp imagined. I'm not sure but would think a large polrtion of those who were around at CCP that came up with titans are no longer there. The "imagination" changes over time. Hard to keep track of.
---
dreads are much easier to kill and cannot recieve reps.
---
XX Group drops 50 dreads on a structure, YY Group uses LR Dreads or Leshaks to melt the dreads.
---
People whinging about plex prices are trying to look at it as a short term thing.  Plex 100 accounts for a year, set all the queues, wait.  The Plex inflation rate + SP value combine to make it work.  If you're plexing month-to-month, you're doing it wrong.
---
The sad thing about warp core stabs. They're a get-out-of-jail-free card, until either you meet someone with enough damage to kill you, or you meet someone who just brings more scrams.  
---
And almost every dedicated hunter ship brings more scrams.
---
(Or alternatively if you're in null or JSpace, Sabre alts. More than once now I've found an explo frig, and rather than tackle him myself I've acted as a warp in point for my Sabre alt and then used the Sabre to solo kill them. Warp core stabs won't protect you from da bubblez.)
---
Augoror is a bit underpowered for this fleet as logi but if you print upside down it might not be that bad.
---
Yes, clearly the game needs more 2000 dps HACs.
---
Its 490km my dude.
---
Lol, I dont think this post went the way you thought it was going to go.
---
You‚Äôre only worth what a kidnapper can get in ransom... or whatever your organs are worth on the black market, depending on health lifestyle, blood type...
---
Yes, titans are only a problem when you can form more titans your sub-cap numbers. /s
---
Their own personal wealth has nothing to do with the current value of the rigs nor does the original price.  If you think that's true try getting some Apple stock at 1996 prices from someone.  After all, that's all they paid for it right?
---
But its only broken when goons have them...
---
So, I had a few musings, and it‚Äôs stopping me from sleeping until I write them down:
---
I guess the problem here comes down to a few points:
---
In eve, a lot of things have two varieties of counter: an ISK efficient counter, where more cheap things can destroy a smaller number of things with a much higher cost, and a Pilot efficient counter, where the right more expensive and/or well used things can destroy a larger number of pilots. I personally think both are necessary.
---
Titans have an ISK efficient counter (Smaller caps), but they don‚Äôt have a pilot efficient counter. That was fine while there were only a few of them, but now, it‚Äôs creating the problem outlined in by the original poster.
---
So, let‚Äôs extend existing mechanics to create one. We don‚Äôt want to immediately reach for a bigger, badder ship, as that just escalates the problem. I would suggest, perhaps, some tech 2 titans, one of which would be our pilot efficient counter to tech 1 and faction titans, by having substantial bonuses to their single target doomsdays and their doomsday resistance, while increasing their vulnerability to non-titans. Say, reduce their electronic warfare resistance stats by a substantial margin, and reduce their tank by ~25-40%, and reduce their regular XL weapons as well, while giving them a 100+% role bonus to the damage of single target doomsdays, and a 5% bonus to doomsday recharge and a 15% reduction to doomsday damage taken per ship command skill level, compared to normal titans. So the intent is that in a large fleet engagement, they significantly outmatch even a larger number of tech 1 titans, but for anything smaller, they are less effective than tier 1‚Äôs, so they should already have an isk efficient counter that‚Äôs actually even stronger against them than the existing ones. I‚Äôm not sure how they would stack up vs supercarriers, I plead ignorance, but I think they‚Äôd be more vulnerable to anything below supercap for sure.
---
Aside: A similar process could give us some form of T2 supercarrier designed to counter T1 supercarriers but nothing else. Those would probably end up being countered by dreads, or titans of either tech level. While we've proliferating T2 caps, we might look at specialised dreadnaughts designed to poke at some of the more annoying features of structures, but that's a whole other can of worms.
---
Aside: We could also create T3 battleships using the modular system that can be designed to engage a specific type of capital far more effectively. For example, for titans, we could have an interdiction-proof ship that we allow to fit an assault damage control lookalike to allow them to more easily tank and dodge AOE doomsdays using short-term endurance and long-term agility, while also having modules that increase damage and/or tankiness against caps at the expense of ability to effectively fight smaller ships. We could also play around with modular components that decrease AOE damage only. There's no reason a T3 BS should only be for anticap, of course, they could have lots of other modules/fits etc- my point is that there are countless options for creating various different ISK-efficient counters for both existing and my hypothetical T2 titans.
---
But by my earlier logic, we also need a pilot efficient counter to my new T2 monsters. And that‚Äôs where we start to run into problems, since we‚Äôve just created a ship that‚Äôs far stronger against small numbers than anything that exists so far. This, in turn, as well as thinking about AOE doomsdays in connection to making large numbers of subcaps effective against titans, made me wonder if the problem is actually doomsdays themselves, and the utterly excessive levels of single target damage they provide compared to anything else in the game.
---
I think the T2 titans would still partially alleviate the current pressure by increasing options, but the solution lies deeper somewhere.
---
Its almost like they have been telling everyone how to do it for 3 years too and everyone just told them they were bad, and carebares, and irrelevant.
---
Now the big bad carebare is killing the game?
---
all solid advice would also like to add a few minor things though. 
---
make sure you have your tactical overlay active and lock your FC. this will give you information about two important things:
---
their range from you in the form of a dot on the overlay 
---
and his direction of travel in the form of a blue arrow out the front of his ship
---
Really confused as to what you're trying to say
---
&gt;As for the rest, please show me that you understand the difference between "emergent" and "exploitative"
---
You are not an authority to judge that, but how about one being a euphemism for "good for me therefore correct" and the other being the likely truth.
---
&gt;and please show me that you know what an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is.
---
If I didnt know, I would look it up. So you get nowhere with that. Given the context, I have almost no idea why they claim they need it other than to exclude the community from discussion. Ultimately, it doesnt matter as serious issues are not addressed.
---
TIL thank you
---
Yeah, I completely overlooked that point. It's also good for gauging the direction of the enemy fleet as well so you dont run headlong into them as well.
---
I would say your well off. With what happening in eve though the only way to be rich is to acquire plex and more plex or follow aryth example and market where it at.
---
Ooh not what I was thinking it might be, but that's very cool!
---
Which was in at leart one article and the patch notes ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
It means you are skulking around the towns trying to kill women and children while the men are off at the front burning down your undefended castles.  That is to say that you are cowardly bandits.
---
30 gank catalysts are currently in warp
---
So what you are saying is that 2019 NC/PL needs to use 2008 Goons tactics to survive?
---
&gt;that we were in any way involved in the decision
---
levying your coalition of thousands of dudes to urge CCP to change the game is effective, yes.
---
WIDOT = anschluss
---
It all makes sense now
---
Pretty sure that 1k number came from someone copying a dscan from a moveop, and then pasting it into a dscan tool two of three times.
---
Good point, but doesn't this also give an advantage to nullseccers in that it doesn't invalidate their vote if their candidate got in and they have others ?
---
I just came across that wormhole, and holy shit, the way the guy anchored them around a planet is beautiful! Ill post pictures
---
Eh, 50 players can easily get 100 dreads without any difficulties. Out of those same 50 players - in my alliance's experience - only 10 or so will have a titan. For any other alliance - good if 1.
---
evemail code permit enforcer in game, i've heisted almost a tril so far in my eve career, with a 100b heist, a 350 bil heist, and a 300 bil heist
---
Agreed.  Again, being facetious
---
This is boredom creation, not boredom mitigation.
---
&gt;Fozzie SOV
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;Damage caps
---
:thinking:
---
Skill injectors and even char trades are definitely a part of the problem. Without them you would have a natural cap on supercapitals as older players with the ability to fly them would phase out over time and be replaced organically with younger players training the skills at regular speed.
---
First point: By default, yes, when you hit V it opens the Probe Scanner window, because D-Scan by default is part of that. So the first step is to disconnect the two.
---
Hit V (opening that window) and in the little box that says Directional Scan, there's a square button in the corner. Hit that button, it'll separate dscan out into its own window. From that point, you can open or close the probe scanner independently while having the dscan window stay open on its own. Pick a place on your screen to put that window, drop it there, and leave it there for eternity (or at least until you redo your UI next). (I'm a bit of a madman who's short on screen space, so I actually shoved my dscan into the same window as my overview, and alternate between the two.)
---
That's the one main thing you're missing really. Once you have it split off like that and in a place where you just know it'll be there, you can start to really use and abuse its magic.
---
At the bottom of the dscan window are two sliders. The first is the range of the scan (either in AU or km; usually better to use AU), the second is the cone angle. Most of the time when you're using dscan as an early warning system, you set the range to however far you need to watch (usually either max range or sub-1AU), set the cone to 360, and just start spamming the button. 
---
However, there are other times when you want to use dscan as an active hunting tool. (This works best in a ship with CovOps cloaking, or one of the Force Recons which is invisible to dscan.) In those cases, you spot your intended target, open the probe scanner window, (keeping the cone at 360) start playing with the range until you find the exact range to the target (within .1AU), and then start reducing the cone. When you're playing with the cone, there's two tricks you can use: 1, while holding the dscan key, clicking on an object in the probe scanner window will rotate your dscan cone to face that object; and 2, while holding the dscan key, clicking and dragging inside the probe scanner window will turn the scan cone. Through this, you can use dscan to pinpoint a target's location, and, if they're at a celestial object, warp to it, or if you have Combat Scanner Probes, you can nail them down with dscan and then get a warp in on them from a single combat probe scan cycle, which minimizes their ability to react to seeing your probes.
---
Another point: rebind the dscan key. Spacebar is a good option, you really don't need spacebar set as a hotkey to open chat. There's a vmeme about thve letter v appvearing in thev middle ofv people typinvg sentences for a goovd reason; but it's easier to spam the button if you rebind it to a more obvious key. (The reason for spamming the button is that dscan doesn't update automatically the way the Overview does; dscan only shows you what it saw at the moment you last hit the button.)
---
Agreed, the infinite capacity for a single sotiyo to build, compared with the limited production capacities of a supercapital construction pos seems like a major contributor to the current state of the game.
---
So Eve Tabletop game when?
---
Does is boxer work?
---
I'm definitely getting a "weird shit you hear at 3AM on a shortwave radio" vibe out of this video.  A little bit of [Over The Horizon radar](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/%27OTH-SW%27_OTH_Radar), with a few other things mixed in as well.
---
Titans already used to AoE when they died.  It was negligible and caused server lag and was removed.
---
Regarding the difference between "emergent" and "exploitative", one is something that CCP is on record touting as a thing that makes EVE great, and one is something that CCP bans people for. So. I think understanding the difference between the two concepts is *pretty important*. I'm not planning to judge you. I am trying to tell what I need to explain, and frankly whether you're just a troll I should ignore.
---
Regarding NDAs, if you don't know and you look it up, *mission fucking accomplished*. So please do.
---
Does it matter
---
I like how the special snowflake Trig shit is placed into the same category of Dreads...
---
Nice fucking powercreep.
---
guardian isn't too bad, same with the oneiros.
---
Also, you cannot be bad at the game in a group of 20 in 2019 eve because a group of 1000 dps destroyers can fly through can kill everything you are flying in under 5 mins.
---
Could have been an elaborate test trap... you never know.
---
It would be pretty weird if she went around drawing that PL herpes virus thing
---
Great post, good advice all around. Having a solid logi anchor is a huge boon for any FC.
---
Im basically in a t1 scanning frigate (Magnate). Is the 30M-70M per sight realistic if I cant really go into the 'dangerous unknown space' wormholes?
---
Also, when I was exploring Catch, I went through loads of systems that just didnt find anything to scan down... Pretty sure I ended up in Evictus space at one point...
---
How bad would Guardians be? I wouldn't think they would be much more different than a Talos.
---

Yes two uncontested keepstar kills within 30 minutes is just so boring. Oh the agony. Please make it stop.

Do you have any idea of the radius this "clumped pile" has?
---
‚ÄúDangerous Unknown‚Äù do not have non-combat data/relic sites, C1-C3 do and will have the ‚ÄúUnknown Space‚Äù in their info.
---
Your best bet to cash out in a relic run is find a quiet pocket of null, and set a route through the whole constellation, or just keep going down the wormhole rabbit hole,
---
I think there something on the esc settings graphics to change the card your using. In general laptop are bad mkay.
---
Glassing means exactly the same but doesn't sound anywhere near as cool.
---
Is there any sort of guide that tells me what to do for implants/neural remap and what skills I should focus on as a new Omega player? I'm not at all sure what I want to do so I don't know what skills are most valuable for me to focus.
---
Hi not at all sure what i want to do so i don't know what skills are most valuable for me to focus., I'm dad.
---
So you basically agree with me and then tell me to educate myself. 
---
Which bit was wrong that I should educate myself upon?
---
This is what I do.
---
&gt;The latter issue really springs from the former.  
---
Yeah, because there definetly hasn't been any large scale botting before injectors were introduced ^/s
---
There is a limit, 256.
---
All of them.
---
Take a look at the [magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14). Note, however, that these are support skills. Early on I'd recommend you pick a (T1) ship you want to fly that you can almost fly and train into it, then go back to working on the magic 14 until you're bored and want a new type of ship that you can't currently fly yet. The main thing is that you shouldn't burn yourself out trying to optimize your skill progression.
