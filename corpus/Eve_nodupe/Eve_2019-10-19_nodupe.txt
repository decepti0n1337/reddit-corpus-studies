Well, lets see here... the game dropped about 15-20% of its population in about 3-4 months, but hey at least the newbies are joining the game and having fun...
---
---
---
Would my orbea rallon suffice?
---
Get a rallon
---
Calling it now, it's going to be a complete fucking joke. Think of some core mechanic that can be changed, now do a 180 and fuck it up massively and put a sticker on it - core gameplay update...
---
While i have shot a mtu or 2 of eve uni, i wont be following them if they move. But having everyone a with in a few jumps from each other would be good. Better comms interaction, less overhead for campus management, better fleet numbers and hopefully not a soft target for war decs.
---
no, take a break from minecraft
---
Yes.
---
Are you so far you can't bend over to put your own socks on? 
---

---
Spend too much time on your PC and have 0 flexablity?
---
Introducing instasocks!
---
It was hilarious when you were trash-talking some WT's in local a few months ago after they got an actual response fleet formed up at them instead of the usual panic and telling everyone who's actually in standing fleet or comms to dock up.
---
Oh okay
---
It has electrolytes!
---
I've noticed without the drugs I miss a lot more. Goes from 25 to like 17 or something it's a hard drop. 
---
I run 2 nestors with it so two of them are remotes. I don't take that long to kill zorya. That's like 5-6 give or take so the tacking clearly helps there but my fleet is also outputting a lot more dps so maybe thats why. Well over 2k. 1500 alone with vindy. 6-700s from nestors.
---
I three shot kikis. Hbu?
---
I'm not trying to say your doing it wrong or anything just trying to find the differences where I can and make my fleet better. I can solo minors with my 3 man squad it's not pretty but it works lol.
---
Ehh wormhole isn't that scary or risky tbh. Null and ls are far more risky even for experienced pilots. As long as you have some idea how to keep safe (dscan, closing extra ents, bubbles.. Blah blah) I own a c2 static c3-hs if your interested In learning.
---
OH vindy fit is neutron blasters meds are recharger battery 2 webs and a tc. Lows are 1 resist mod 1 1600plate and magstabs with 1 or 2 teaching enhs.
---
I don't like shield vindies lol.
---
This is a pretty good idea. Those are rare on /r/Eve. Well done!
---
For combat skills this would make sense to some degree. But what about more niche skills? For example scanning. Theres really only 4 skills associated with that. So once you max that out, what benefit do you gain?
---
So, I really like the phantasm. The best thing about the ship by far is the ship's afterburner bonus, it means scrams won't slow it down. Which in turn means that in nullsec, where webs are slightly less common than lowsec you can intentionally get into bad situations, see how they go, and then power your way out to safety. 
---
The ship is hard to pin down and it's mobility is the key to it's value. It can do decent damage at decent ranges with a tank that I'd say is middle of the road unless you spend a lot on it. But it's also taking less damage than other ships in the same class because of its higher speed to signature ratio, again, due to it's afterburner bonus. 
---
I'm sure there are some PVE uses, I'm not PVE guy at all so I don't know but it has some fun, even if a bit niche, place in PVP. The one I fly is fully fit with some inexpensive faction mods for less than 200 million. 
---
It's not that expensive to try out especially if you're with some friends. Good luck.
---
We've been known to do damage with them.
---
Looks interesting
---
not to mention py3 is generally faster and more memory efficient, plus it offers type annotations which is pretty cool for managing codebases
---
but I bought my tix 5 MONTHS ago
---
Bullshit you have 1000+ members about 60 of those got on a killmail last month the month before not much better, and yes you where above the 1k mark at the point, also a majority of your players that leave do so in a couple of days. 
---
And you have 4% tax rate, my look at that corp it scream jita spam corp that does nothing for it's members doesn't have infrastructure and monetizes new players ( in terms of isk ).
---
The only reason you exist is for your leadership to make money of newbro's running missions.
---
I like to stick with T1 frigates for most of my PVE. 
---
I identify which modules I will need for my intended activity, then what modules would be nice to have. I choose the frigate based on the power grid, cpu to fit the modules. 
---
Most of my time in Eve is spent making unconventional frigate ship fits.
---
Iâ€™ve tried a few out and found 3 alpha fits (2hulls) that I enjoy. 
---
My salvage frigate, ratting frigate (skill spree and emerging conduits), core probe scanning frigate (WH prober). 
---
I think it just comes down to what you will enjoy flying; I happen to love frigates.
---
The time you spend looking is negative isk Time
---
Join Karmafleet
---
It must be speculation based on CSM leaks.  Quick, CCP, ban a random CSM member with no evidence!  GO!
---
not edited, i've seen some sig names but this one takes the cake
---
Or just don't be terrible and warp to pings rather than gate-to-gate.
---
0_o i ain't going anywhere... just not to vegas ;)
---
hodl?
---
Join origin I hear that they like playing eve
---
&gt;1. Only one character per account is allowed on the server.
---
This will just lead to less players, and many will still Plex multiple accounts. People who can pay for more alts will, and the imbalance will be there. 
---
&gt;The server is small. Less than 25% the size of traq.
---
Bit of an odd one. But it'll have less than 10% of the players of tranquility, so it'd feel big.
---
&gt;No incursions, FW missions, or similar isk faucets. You gotta grind out your isk so every loss matters. 
---
Where tf will all the isk come from on this server then? Incursions are about 100mil per hour? And the grind is what makes the game less fun. I like the ability to fly a 100mil ship + fit and have it replaced in an hour or two. The skills to fly a top tier incursion ship took a while to train. Why not nerf L4 blitzing, completely nerf wormhole sites so you can't make billions in a day, nerf PI alts (no afk millions for you!), Nerf explo loot and relic/data sites. If you want to afford anything above cruiser, you now need to put in multiple hour shifts to do it. 
---
No thanks, I already have a job. 
---
None of these changes will improve anything. Also losses do matter to many players currently. It's just the ones who have been playing for a decade and are sitting on hundreds of billions of ISK  200mil sp have forgotten about this.
---
&gt;9. Anom spawns decreased as well as payout. 
---
&gt;10. No insurance pay outs
---
This will all just lead to people being risk averse. Why the fuck am I going to play something that essentially sets me back days/weeks of my time (if I have limited hours to play), when I can lose it all Vs someone who isn't afraid to whip out a credit card/ can put in 6 hours a day Vs my 1 every other day. 
---
There is no reward on your server, it's not worth the hours of have to put in. Insurance is there to make it easier to lose ships with a smile.
---
If you wanted to do this, you'd need to make the things you're nerfing exponentially more fun, or people would just play other games. 
---
&gt;It would be one big brawl as the new characters are created and the tiny space is fought over. We would still have huge battles on traq for all the dick swinging alliances, but would have a new space for tiny gang battles and constant fights. 
---
No we wouldn't, there'd be a couple of fights between the literal dozens of players on the new server, and then weeks of grinding to make up what they lost.
---
Also an insurmountable gap between old and new players. 
---
&gt;This concept wouldn't take away anything we have now, it would just add another option. We could log into traq, do the huge battle, check out market orders. Then switch to the new server for a small gang roam and ratting in an effort to save up for a battleship.
---
This sounds shit. Why play two games, but one is essentially tidi for the rate you can earn and replace things? 
---
Just join my corp at 80% tax and I'll do most of your changes for you without needing a new server.
---
Around 70% buy back
---
The Proteus is also running the hybrid gun offensive system, and fitted decidedly "not hybrid".  At least he didn't fuck up the other three subsystems.  Much, at least.
---
Because PIRAT ever cared about fair fights.
---
They get reinbursed fyi. Once a ccp pet always a pet.
---
Leshak and Rattlesnake can be used in escalation too. I'm using Rattlesnake combined with Gecko drone
---
They pay people token ammounts of isk to not reinforce structures. There is only so many structure timers u can trick line members to going too.
---
Chakram :)
---
I see you try to give this story a other spin. You are not a underdog you never was.
---
We see ourself as a movement !
---
We give everyone the chance to fight against you.
---
Our fleets are mash up so everyone can join and bring what they like.
---
And you know there is a difference if you have one fleet with an overblinged Rep squad.
---
 then a mixed fleet with different alliances who cant rep each other.
---
Iam pretty happy with the outcome so far even former miner victims create pvp ships and start to shoot you.
---
Regards,
---
Cyber Fight'r
---
OTOH, the API didn't distinguish between originals or copies for the longest time.  Not sure if they were clarified retroactively, but it's possible some were lost with no way to prove it.
---
I agree most are sitting in a station, though.
---
This seems like a decent idea.
---
Kinda new to eve but what i understand from people in local is PIRAT is the alliance that is centered around homosexual meet ups? I'm glad there's a place for everyone in eve.
---
https://github.com/Kyle-Cerniglia/EvE-3D-Printing from this repository I chopped it up because....its gonna be damn huge
---
Will do!
---
Except that is exactly how skills in eve are different from all the grinding MMOs, everyone trains at the same rl speed regardless of how much time you spend in the game. I know you tried to sneak in isk-&gt;skill injectors at the end, but isk can be had from rl money-&gt;plex so there's no need to actually play the game for that either.
---
I run a small hs/class 2 wormhole Corp. ~10 people give or take. We run a few stations do a lot of pve and indy
---
But before I go further. Your additude isn't.. Very.. Eve friendly.. Not that I ask for a commitment but your not going to get anyone biting with the fuck yo timers line.. Or won't join hippies. Altho I understand not wanting to join a rule heavy Corp. 
---
I'll be happy to take you but if our wormhole station gets hit one would expect you to show to defend your/our shit. 
---
I'm saying this for everyone not just myself. Because everyone would expect you to show for an important timer. None of this is implying that eve &gt; rl but there are some important things one has to be avaliable for if they expect to join a Corp that isn't just carebears or blobsec.
---
Not trying to be a dick or rain on your parade just making sure you know what your getting into.
---
Looks like you lost the raven and gnosis soon after the bash. Well played though. The loot should have covered your losses.
---
What about a War Intelligence Room service module? When installed, it allows the structure to be used as a War HQ. 
---
If you want to use disposable stations for the task, you still have to buy the module, online it and keep it fuelled. Should the station run out of fuel and the module goes offline, the war is withdrawn.
---
It doesn't have to be very expensive, but it makes sure the attacker considers whether to put up a cheap station and have to fuel it - or adds the module to a well defended station, in which case they need to plan whether they have enough free service slots.
---
This would also allow war caps to be added if that ever became a thing. For example, each War Intelligence Room allows for 5 wardecs.
---
There is only 1 reason why you'd unplug implants from your clone while in space under combat and that is so the implants don't show up on your lossmail.
---
Thing about local is, take everything in with a grain of salt, or else you might get your isk doubled in no time
---
We had an existing relationship with one of the groups from our previous assaults on their sizeable industrial interests.  Its the only conversation I have had regarding this stuff afaik.  Feel free to ask any questions you like, I'm an open book.
---
It didn't for a very long time. And now for a very long time it can. Check any BP and it will have an attribute "Original" - Yes/No. That's what makes it possible.
---
Uhm... I like the black/grey... Am I odd? \*thonking\*
---
but they can not know that the game doesnt actually look like a black spreadsheet
---
Deal Kinetic Damage.
---
You will want to tank Kinetic Thermal.
---
The Garmur 200dps or so will do.
---
The Orthrus 3-400dps.
---
The Bhargest I needed 800dps to kill it in good time. (I use a Carrier for these now because it takes so long otherwise).
---
lmfao hisec gossip and food fights
---
You donâ€™t have to use zkillboard. Or support him. Why donâ€™t you go make your own killboard and let me know how that goes for you.
---
I smell a classic Chimera model. 
---
Thank fuck, I hate the new one.
---
I understand and am open to your idea. I am just wondering if it could swing the balance the other way. It seems easier to gather people if there is only one target to take down. Probably a good thing though.

I hope you enjoy the art and that there will be more to come!
---
This has always been one of the most idiotic decisions CCP has made regarding alphas.  Restricting the UI color of your free-to-plays is a fucking joke, literally hurting usability for no reason other than to be an asshole.
---
can confirm, alpha colors are racist.
---
The entire UI color setting section is hidden for alpha accounts.
---
You are a entitled fuck. You are not forced to use his site, give isk or money... get a real problem to complain about and stop being a twat.
---
They already are in special corps and there already is such a channel.
---
Alphas should shut the fuck up.
---
I would be intrested in purchasing art from you!
---
What way the spaghetti alphabet yet ma puts oot on special occasions!
---
I never understood this, why in all the fucks would you harrass new players, especially the ones that want to learn? Eve is in desperate need of newbros that want to learn and stick around.
---
Agreed
---
Yup the superior model of chimera
---
See you on the front page!
---
&gt;costs him rl bux to operate. he was asking for fictional bux for spending his spare time and rl bux to operate. he now has a patreon for rl bux donations.
---
So he was rmt'ing? Sounds like something he'd do.
---
yup thats exactly what he was doing. i also bot the shit out of eve and rmt it to pay my mortgage.
---
You can put a positive spin on the experience by mailing the character in question and saying "Don't mind those meatheads, they're just excited about the battlecruiser fight that happened last night" and then begin unravelling the complexity. It'll serve both perposes of reminding them there *are* friendly players out there, while helping them overcome their current difficulty. Who knows, you might even make a friend :3
---
Wouldn't surprise me, a small brainer like you probably can't get a job good enough to pay his mortgage.
---
well duh. this thread of yours is a higher IQ play than anything ive ever seen before.
---
His video is using the mega not the Mach. Don't troll.
---
Just spread the word on holding corps and let this crappy gameplay die...  Literally every worthwhile corp has either already done this, or is in the process.
---
Other than taking down trade hubs structures, i have yet to see a war dec be used for anything other ganking scrubs.  While this does create some hilarious KM's, it just wastes everyone elses time coming up with suggestions on how to make it fun, and dev time being used to implement them.
---
Uhm, elite PvP-group? I mean, some of our dudes are pretty good individually, but... Nah, I dont think so.  
---
And see it a bit more differenciated, please: I love helping folks out and I appreciate getting help or seeing other folks helping others. Thats not only OK but highly, heartwarmingly valued. But when someone starts an hourlong( I m not exaggerating here, been there suffered that) sermon about some rather simple question he is not helping me, he is wasting my time for feeding his own ego. Especially( though that might be my personal problem) I usually know all the other fluff those sermons include, I m just missing that piece of information I m asking for to get the whole puzzle together, but am too polite to tell folks "STAAAHP! I play EVE for more than a handful of years now, I know most of that fuzz you re talking about like its secret knowledge. I m just missing that single isolated answer.".
---
Besides: It feels a bit like being talked down to/being thought of as entire newbie when someone starts explaining you e.g. what PG and CPU are for.
---
Mhmm.. and water gets you wet and fire is hot. Tell us something new. RR was always known to be major botting/scripting users. Main reason Sort kicked Slyce from GOTG.
---
jumped in last night .. the market is as you said, sad.
---
I definitely wouldn't start crafting to sell things until you're a bit more used to the game.  Part of crafting is knowing what people actually need.  You can guess some of that from price and market movement, but there's so many items and so many traps that a little experience will save you a ton of research.
---
NPC corps should be reserved for new bro's, after 90 days chars should be placed into war deccable holding corps.
---
thats...hey thats pretty good!

Please provide 30 seperate named visa debit or credit cards for each account thank, you come again.

Breaking news: NPC/CCP His Grace The Lord Sarum's Secretary has appeared and has said that since the Amarrians own the system of Floseswin, they intend to enslave the population.  They also call for loyalists to take back Arzad (referred to as Starkman by the Minmatar). This is significant because both of these systems are treaty systems that have FW mission agents.
---
These developments add additional strain to the treaty between the Amarr and Minmatar. RP entities from both sides already put pressure on the treaty signers, some calling them traitors.  Both sides have had multiple pilots break away over disagreements about the treaty.
---
Time will tell how the already tense relationship between the Amarr and Minmatar will be affected.
---
Some people just enjoy being a dick.

I am a 2011 player with a corp history long as my two arms back to back. Never been an issue to join whatever. People move, change groups, space types, regions. It's all good, I've been in HS, LS, NS, W-Space. If there is any issue you'll probably just be asked about it and that's it.
---
Then, live in Aridia is better then live in Delve? Because that's where was RR lived. 
---
Wait a sec, Goons must be really stupid then :P
---
You can live in 0.0 and still have bots running in lowsec. It's not mutually exclusive.
---
If that were possible you would have zero posts.
---
POSPY btw
---
Top.  Men.
---
Yeah, I was in my industry phase at the time, was a little harder to tell from killboards
---
Your flair is mlyp; no value.
---
We have a tax app that taxes you a percentage of jita values for what you mined. We drop the amount heavily on ochre and mercoxit to encourage mining of it. You pay your bill every month.
---
This is interesting to know. I didn't realize this. This actually makes it easier to curate for shit heads imo. As another mentioned push all toons over x in game time out and into standard npc Corp not newbro.
---
This felt good(:
---
I kind of like both the idea of NPE chat and what you're saying too. I would think some sort of a high-sec FW corp with standard hs settings instead of full pvp fw settings. This would have the potential of making character selection feel like it matters while providing a corp that might (or might not) just be farming alts. Even the tutorial missions might feel more natural this way since they are already racially split. Even if the other pilots are alts, it could work as an introduction to other corps outside of fw. I would think that something like that would be a very easy transfer to full fw with pvp but now you have a supporting corp instead of entering solo. Some of those corps are also very active in both pvp and pve in all sec spaces. Just some thoughts being thrown around randomly but could be something (or not).
---
This might be a better starting system. God knows that corp finder system won't get you there.
---
I joined TEST about a week ago and knew him for the first time.
---
Many people, including me, are sorry for your death.
---
May your soul rest in peace.
---
Also a great reason to uninstall. Think about it. "We like to think that player abuse is good for retention". Finding a corp can take ages if it happens successfully at all.

Probably the most harmless type of snake there is, they're not venomous and are extremely timid and shy. They're primary defense mechanism is to curl up into a ball when threatened, hence "Ball" python.
