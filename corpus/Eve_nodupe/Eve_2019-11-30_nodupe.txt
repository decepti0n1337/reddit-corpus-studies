@[Plebius-Maximus](https://www.reddit.com/user/Plebius-Maximus) Just letting you know I have STFU ISK.
---
That's how all you elitist holetards play so u can warp off if sum1 shoot back
---
Deadstop. You can't be aligned and not moving (it doesn't work like that). If you're orbiting you may take longer to warp put, depending on the vector.

Me too

Got called out on reddit for getting scammed and killed by caps. So I figured I'd help a bro out and give him 10b because I can. Besides, 10b could change the way someone plays. Plebius-Maximus said I wouldn't. But I did. Spread the love to a new bro. Be it in advise or in ISK. A little bit goes a long way ;)
---
Thanks for the clarification, and good on you for trying the video editing, can only get better from here
---
Must be nice
---
I never knew how much I needed a tabletop Eve war game like Battlefleet Gothic until now.
---
Magus, Typhoon and a Logi-Legion. 
---
I would absolutely spend money for models of those ships.
---
Hi buddy o/
---
Wait, really? 
---
Is this a troll?
---
I must be blind...I cant find the models
---
Same thing here, don't think anyone hacked your accounts.
---
Extremely obvious bait at that.
---
Yes we still running around like headless chickens. 
---
Please come and learn with us the best way is to get on coms and join fleet. 
---
We are a learn by dying corp and you will die a lot but just tell people you are new and need help. 
---
Ships will be given to you if you ask nicely.
---
Even us as a alliance are learning on the job we Enjoy Fw a lot but we not very good at the sitting in a plex and watching the clock slowly tumble down part. As soon as we see a target weâ€™re of so in all we are still very much learning as a corp!
---
Hope this helps.

Cheers nitro
---
You didn't know CCP was Icelandic?
---
Both sides are in agreement of the treaty (with some players going turncoat). 
---
Majority of players want to see change in fw and are at their best not flipping agent systems. The pendulum is non existent over here now because the warzone movers and shakers are communicating with each other everyday due to the treaty.
---
Muta hulls equals bricked ships equals mineral sink
---
Wow! Great video!
---
I like how you sorted your locked targets friendly to foe. Being a logi boat and DPS boat can be confusing.
---
I also really liked how your commentary used green and red lettering so the viewer didn't get confused.
---
There was a while there where your reactive was off but you had plenty of cap to spare.
---
Overrepping the mega lead to a lot of wasted cap, which hurt you when you were the primary. You were forced to pulse a repper but you were still repping the mega that had full armor.  But, maybe it helped you out in the end because bait tank.
---
I bet those guys were trying for the jam/boosh combo.  I saw your drek and mega scram each other to prevent booshing.  The scorps would be great to prevent that while boosh dessys chain booshed.
---
Overall, great video! Keep them coming!
---
They banned it because of CSGO scandals. Let's be real.
---
Woah!
---
This is Eve.
---
That's called cloaking. Pretty much anything can fit one.
---
Ah I see. Great job on the prints nonetheless. They're beautiful
---
Maybe you should consider a different game.
---
Much love to Eve Scout and their awesome service, but that goes both ways. A couple of times Iâ€™ve dipped into a supposed Thera connection based on the published sig ID only to find it was a regular WH.
---
They didn't have the dev time to REALLY work on the new bookmark system, they had to pour those hours of dev time into the Hypershit Relay flashy UI.
---
Little early you are it seems
---
Thatâ€™s a probe !! Or cheetah
---
They had to spend the extr devtime on nested bookmark menus that literally no one ever wanted, so they were unable to allocate devtime to tradeable bookmarks that everyone wanted.
---
What's the lore behind hypernet?
---
Wouldn't it be simpler and less problematic to just reduce the Sabres tank a bit? That's the problem.
---
Most fast ships are not good at taking damage.  Nerf it harrrd

blizzard hosed them by not extending the contract and not paying for the data.

I started using a Myrmidon and now I see it everywhere haha

Good job

I love seeing diversity and free choice of pilots instead of dogmatic dictatorship type sticking to boring hull bonuses and what not.

Talk about Hongkong or uigurs before you travel to china.

Data does matter.

I heard Amok needs all the help they can get.

Super cool, great work!

Thinking about buying one of the Amarr ones.

Pando if init dies ill vouch u into hk my vouches carry a lot of weight trust me

Are they really traitors if they didn't agree to the treaty in the first place? ðŸ¤”
---
In your opinion, what issues have the new bookmarks introduced? (besides all of the extra nesting, which can be pretty annoying to be fair)
---
I actually undock PvP ships when some nerds are around looking for trouble. What I see is Wormholer come for PvE ships then going back where they came from, just saying.
---
Sisters found stain low sec gate that sleepers nicked ages ago. They are going to install it this weekend. In return Sansha will pour Shield slaves on them.
---
ive been running T5 electrical abyss for a while and recently i tried invasions - i have vargur in which i run minors together with friend in paladin and i also run emergings in same ship  
---
Lootwise are T5 little better, but not much imho - im not in optimal fit for emergings in vargur so i can make around 120m/hour and my fit is around 3b including implants. 
---
For abyss i have vagabond with little lower pricetag (2,5b)m both fits include some mid-grade crystals. As i am buying T5 electrical filaments, which are most expensive and i am also running some drugs, i usually end up with 120 to 150M isk positive after one hour (3 filaments), but htere is also chance to get some nice skillbooks, which can be sold for hudreds of millions of isk, but i havent get one of those in last few hour cycles.
---
My PoV is this:  
---
Abyss is generally little better, if i get some skillbooks dropped, it makes nice bonus.
---
Input price for ships and implants its pretty much same for both (if you dont run emerging in 3b ship which is not necessary at all)
---
biggest difference imho is in risk. In abyss, you need to focus much more and you have to know what to shoot first, because if you are not aware of what each enemy does, you will die. Invasions are generally much more forgiving, you can just shoot first enemy you see and you will be fine.
---
Random problems liek game crash, pc crash etc have potential to kill you on both sides, but for me, its kinda safer in abyss and my vaga is permanently running sb, while my vargur is running it only when needed. (once i had to restart pc mid fight in abyss, beucase it completely froze and my vaga managed to tank 2 fully charged vedmaks). Abyss also gives you timer, in which you die, which might be problem too
---
You clearly didn't read.
---
Supers used to be cyno only and jump fatigue and small ranges weren't a thing, moving a super fleet from insmother to bale of the silent was a matter of 45 minutes incl formup for PL back then

The rare council of eve psychics
---
how would the dude know what this post is about if he doesnt know what hoboleaks is? chill out dude
---
It wants to be bigger in scope than eve when to do so is impossible for in development and hardware.
---
You know, according to this sub there's a major market for these models and you're an idiot if you're not getting rich off of it.
---
Source: the exact same post about CCP selling models once a month.
---
The where in the what?
---
- Spanish guy
---
Nah people just downvote unnecessarily abrasive comments.
---
Who do i contract my stuff to for the "transport"? :D
---
You already live in a wormhole with rattlesnakes.
---
So you should have SP and time.
---
Didn't airliners already adjust flight prices based on data about users locations and occupation.
---
Basically tickets were cheaper if you simply ran incognito mode in browser if you lived in a expensive area with a good paying job.
---
It would be a bit OP to give the bubble dual EWAR effect for those races that have "secondary" racial EWAR (neut/web/scram). Web/scram especially would be problem.
---
So just keep it at Trackign/guidance disruptors, Damps, ECM and target painting.
---
This is the only valid chat message when dealing with Chinese players though
---
It's not for you as a thinking citizen. It's for sticking in the craw of the egomaniacs that run the chinese government and the sycophants who agree with everything it does.
---
I know what i want for christmas
---
Do you make and sell them? Say a Zealot?
---
I see you're not very good with sarcasm
---
Yep, they up the price the more you revisit the website, it's a way to make you think it's getting more expensive so you are tempted to buy. When you're ready to buy just use someone's rules phone or something and the prices reset
---
IIRC it was when carriers were still allowed in hisec and they changed that, every carrier became a FAX. I'm not entirely sure though.
---
Exactly. Probably the most realistic method of doing this would be to just license the IP to a company that already makes model kits and has all the infrastructure in place to design and manufacture them. The issue with that is CCP would probably only end up making a small royalty on each kit and it would end up not being worth the effort, financially.
---
HerrBert come back!
---
It's more expensive to do it your way.  
---
I do agree with the sentiment that a pod should not have the same sensor suite as a battleship.  It would not be unreasonable for every group of hulls to have a slightly different UI.  Certainly, it would be an improvement to vidoes.
---
Here I forgot this: /s
---
You're so gangster dude
---
Yeah, besides half-assed lore justifying them it just feels sloppy and like you said not very immersive. It makes it feel more like a dev tool than an immersive game client view.  I think even Hilmar mentioned ships don't have any 'weight' to them, which is mainly because of how the camera works. Also double clicking to set direction feels very cheap and outdated.
---
Bad sadly solo and small gang fights heavily really on those mechanics.  Perhaps some kind of simulation skin or filter would already help.
---
To clarify, with the introduction of FAX's, every carrier with a triage module fit turned into a FAX
---
Hey moron, solo dreads and sieged fax are pretty much the only ships in the game a fort can kill.  Try harder when shit posting next time.
---
I`m going to sound hella virgin but the narrator has a super soothing voice.
---
Definitely train these 14 skills at least to IV. They are not low effect, they are extremely important to train to be able to pilot and fit your ship properly.
---
Make them shareable and allow BMs in the "main" menu.
---
2 dreads is hardly a dreadbomb. 
---
Looks like the Rev is a HAW set up anyway, those are pretty fun to go around with just one or two of like that.
---
So you think they should add paywalled "content". Okay.
---
I started in 05. The game was magic then.
---
I was there
---
if you're strat blue you still shoot them at any given time
---
you giveth you taketh
---
So what you're saying is that Eve is not real, and what we see is just a simulation? Stop with this heresy
---
We could just assume that all those lore articles are historical from some time point before YC105 and the current tech is just better.
---
Also I really want to be able to warp to arbitrary coordinates in system. Just let me punch in the numbers and initiate warp.
---
If the damn thing can contain a beam of plasma and make it do a 180 it might just be able to contain the thermal energy as well.

They cribbed it from _Outlaw Star_ where to get a real time external view of your ship beating another ship to death is efficent.
---
They also fire off 40-60 of them.

the air approaching the containment field would become hotter and thus would expand, reducing a lot the flow of air that comes in the containment field, deviating the flow of air just like a boat deviates the flow of water by going through it but can't prevent an heavy enough iceberg from sinking it.

---
hes not right.  ccp can nkt survive just on eve. it has to expand to other games or it will die.  focusing on the new eden ip means they can add more people to the universe, but just focusing on eve makes zero sense from a business stand point.
---
He was a retard in TEST and nothing has changed since.
---
SC will never be what it's fanboys want it to be. Its been way too many years without the vision being realized.
---
Content deployments are great
---
I can't leave
---
Sir, this is a Wendy's
---
I'm pretty sure he was too. What did we ever do to you to get a callout in a totally random thread? :p
---
Uh dude how else are you gonna mine billions of tons of ore
---
I'm very partial to the stabber and variants myself.
---
Though it looked better before they changed the engine effects. The whole back end glowed at the seams it was epic.
---
i think a beam paladin would not do well honestly.  the trigs mwd if they are too far away from you and you wont be able to track them at all.  then they will be on top of you before you know it and you are gonna be hurtin bad on tracking.
---
Wh groups are generally weak.
---
Missiles have no chance for critical hits and never miss.  So if you did more damage then then target likely slowed down.
---
Make a new folder under personal, put new bookmarks there.
---
Chances are you haven't made a new folder(s) for your personal bookmarks so they're all in a folder "Character Name" under personal and its too full because CCP threw all your old bookmarks into one folder. 
---
Start making new personal folders to sort said bookmarks.
---
You don't get to talk to me until the TDSIN fort is on zkillboard.
---
For real though I know this comes off as super whiny, hence the [Tears] tag. I just think it needs to be put out there.
---
I'd invite you guys but Pando evicted y'all so clearly he's a better batphone
---
Yeah, it's a shame its use is a bit niche because it's one of the best ship designs visually.
---
this shit is so fucking sweet too. You have no idea.
---
BRO the Cane is amazing for roaming solo, still! Just go full scramramcane and rack up the kills! It's so much fun.
---
I also like using myrms to blend in with the krabs.......
---
&gt;looks at past 16 years
---
yeah sure
---
Raisin 'Cane!
---
He would if he was in China.
---
Sounds like a mouth breathing NC. Flair checks out.
---
&gt; just reduce the Sabres tank a bit? That's the problem
---
what makes you think the sabre is chosen over the others due to its tank(????), its tank is a cloak
---
&gt;It's a sink for ISK and PLEX. I'm not keen on the idea of a new PLEX sink personally, but a new ISK sink is not a bad thing.
---
This is a good thing? This is very bad for the game. I think even CCP said plex was too expensive a while ago.
---
That and Lord Maldoror's B-R video was what convinced me to play back in 2015. It's got a special place in my heart.
---
The new system is actually pretty efficient for selling bookmarks still. Yes not as easy as a contract, and you sometimes have to talk to the buyer - damn ccp making me talk to people. 
---
Create a shared folder for site sales. create an access list for sellers. Put the buyer on the access list. They copy the bookmark to their personal folder and send isks.
---
Remove them from the access list and repeat.
---
Please stop breathing.
---
Which sites can I gamble with ISK?
---
You do support paywalling functionality, so use real money.
---
It's still entirely within game, unlike IWI.
---
CCP couldn't see the difference between some isk just being handed over,  and someone actually winning. It was just isk coming out of an account.
---
With hypernet, it's all within game. Everything can be tracked.
---
:bigthink:
---
Nah, think Iâ€™ll just use ISK on the Hypernet Relay right in the Eve client. Thanks though.
---
People outside of China tend not to care about censorship as much
---
So then why was that FC kicked if it was an unstrategic fight?
---
But you do understand that CCP makes money off of this and that is the purpose?
---
Need a good war for that
---
Believe it or not Iâ€™m 100% ok with the developer of my favorite game making money.
---
There was that thing with the naked dancing guy a while ago.
---
Maybe they are all playing the game and posting other places and r/Eve isnâ€™t the end all be all of out of game content.
---
&gt; I'm on a Google Pixel 4 XL
---
tbh I doubt a single 4xl pixel is enough even for a non-Eve CCP game
---
We already paying for it. Why should I pay again?
---
you can still get caps into highsec if you get a bad/new GM that moves your "stuck" ship to your home station, happened to a friend of mine a year ago
---
Elective activity.
---
Good fights. We'll look after Kor Azor for you.
---
Check the Meta level of the weapon, I think Arbalests are one of the better common ones, you will have to compare stats.
---
Incursions and PI
---
Nah, Providence is still better looking ship... but Cane, or Minmatar caps (apart from God-awful-fugly Rag) do look awesome indeed.
---
You should never put LMLs on a cruiser. RLML is the cruiser size weapon and is much better. Caracals also work with HAMs and HMs but those aren't great.
---
Exploration, gas huffing, killing sleepers, PI, and T3 research. I can PLEX if I want, but Iâ€™m just paying my sub, I need the isk expanding into a new place, then Iâ€™ll PLEX my alt in another month or so, and PI and gas collection will double, and Iâ€™ll be in full swing again.
---
As someone who has done enough to PLEX two accounts, itâ€™s not fun blowing 4B at the end of the month though.
---
Mike PLEASE
---
Join a group of people that are willing to assist you in making isk in null. I reccomend Brave Newbies.
---
I really think if CCP had release Hypernet right after banning IWI no one would have cried
---
I could really use some isk right  now
---
Yeah. Not just the spawn either. 
---
I got two game crashes right after patches, when the ONLY thing different about computer WAS the patch, causing losses in Abysses I was owning easily. So logically the patches HAD to be the cause.
---
CCP's response? Fuck off.
---
