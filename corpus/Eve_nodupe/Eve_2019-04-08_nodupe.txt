if you don't have a spreadsheet should be helpful

made it not to long ago only thing that doesn't work is the volume per day function cauuuse I have been lazy since not trading.

---
Are you in Pandemic Legion? I've heard this from others.
---
More to the point... Doesn't everybody have Command Destroyers V. Like I'm sure it's a core eve skill.
---
Never not take the bait though, it's always fun.
---
im in cva
---
My issue with extractors is farms.. Injecting is fine makes the fleet of the month easier for new bros lol.
---
The issue is the amount of accounts that have been made simply to farm SP I think they should limit it some how. Either by x extracts per mo or the more sp you have the more you extract rever diminishing returns kinda thing. Idk.  But CCP needs to do something. 
---
A real number on skill farmed toons would be cool also.
---
And it makes cloaky camping hella cheap which is gay.
---
Bastion massively increases reps/resists.  If you're not going to use it then fly a standard T1 BS.
---
You mean Goons evicted HK.  
---
It's all painfully accurate
---
You see, I don't participate in any way, shape, or form, with any activity that is a banable offense.  So I laugh in your general direction. 
---
You act as if this is happening to players all over.  It isn't.  It happened to you, because you broke the ToS and they have good enough paperwork on it that they don't need your input on the matter.
---
Dude you obviously dont understand the joke, none of the sweatyness happened only the tight bosonic to your fleet lol rekt nerd
---
In this case it was a bird—a phoenix to be exact. In all honesty bird law is not governed by reason.
---
Agreed entirely. o7
---
great way to play eve , spin ship in station and plan for 2 years to take credit for spining ship in station . fly bomber fleet when feel like it and run when cannot out form enemy 3 times . that the basic game play of all goons pilot .. GG
---
Missing barrel roll.
---
no one willingly goes that meta
---
1 fucking resist mod? You have 100 million to pay for shipping but can't come up with the 5-10 mill needed for a real tank and a cloak?
---
You know you will be that kind of guy crying in few month when goons will roll their super/titan fleet all around the place burning everything to the ground right ? 
---
&gt;Convince me otherwise.

You guys are awesome, and I'll admit to missing the love/hate/grr of it all. 
---
why would you need to plex the account to run a VNI bot? You're already cheating, why not just run multiple alpha clients through virtual machines and VPNs?
---
Lot of basic bots that can be trained using Alpha skills.  A guy running 50 gilas doesnt use injecters
---
Having dealt with him in the NSH coordination Discord, no. He's just that fucking dumb.

Was expecting something about multiplasmids. Meh

Not too far from the truth except I have been very active the last 2 years behind the scenes.

References 2 degrees as a qualifier.... For some reason I'm not excited a recent graduate can't sleep for 2 years because a C-Tier alliance failed.
---
what did he say
---
Lol we never even said that. Everyone else said that
---
That one time you poked the bee hive with a stick.
---
Not too far from the truth except I have been very active against panfam the last two years ripping apart all the things I helped build.

because you get some of his stuff and a cool kill

Maybe one day we can hang out and chat about our respective failed alliances...

You could have put 2 full subcap fleets through rage's static with almost no prior logistics, taken hole control and evicted them just fine anyways.

Lots of mid slots for both your cargo/ship scanners and your sensor boosters. It's the only Cruiser with 6 mid slots.

Serenity was *the* Chinese server that was completely ruined by rampant botting that there was no counter measure for as it is part of the culture of the Chinese to "win at all costs". It's not random stats if it's literally in your face.

The prices for skill injectors are around 100-150 mil more per injector now than they were 3 months ago, and people were still making money on the prices at that time, so if anything they are making more money now.

Are distribution missions worth doing? I did a Level 3 distribution mission and got ganked on my way back and got my freighter with about 5mil isk total equipment destroyed. Didn't have enough warp stabilizers to counter the amount of disruption at the gate.

It's not an unpopular opinion, you are just wrong.
---
Delve and Syndicate where mine before I won the game.  Good fun was had in Curse too for an honorable mention. 
---
Why would I give people a 'gf' when I'm mining and they show up and kill me?  I mean...maybe it's rude to not say good fight when they show and gank me without me having a way to defend myself, but I'm definitely not gonna say it.  Especially when they try to gloat about it.
---
And no, I'm too anxious to go out of my way to purposely try and talk to people I don't know.  Coming on reddit and making a post is about as social as I can usually manage to get with strangers.
---
I'm already in a corp.  They think I'm a spy.  They don't really talk to me, I don't really talk to them.  I just kinda stick to myself and mine while I'm trying to train up skills because I can't use anything right now.  Which is possibly another reason why nobody wants to talk to me.  I'm mining and not out trying to pick fights with people when I know I'm going to lose.

Nice YouTube copyright strike stupid idiot.
---
Distribution missions are a a decent low effort methought to raise one's standing, but generally are e very poor method to make ISK.
---
Are Gilas still the go-to ship for tier 4 Abyssal after the nerf? Are there any good alternatives?
---
Take your Corp, move to a wormhole. Enjoy the good Eve my man
---
All you nerds saying Black Rise need to get back here. 
---
Heh. Plebs.
---
Was expecting dirt and glitter spam to be had in the comments.
---
Whenever I get below 2 bil I hop in an astero and explore for a few days. Then I go back home and pvp until I’m below 2 bil again. That’s really all the isk management I have, if I’m buying lots of new ships to try it just means I explore more
---
HTFU my dude. CCP's game CCP's way.
---
Who paid you to advertise and where can I sign up?
---
I didn't  say they were plexing...
---
In the days of AT ship bullshittery and mass titans, this is actually the most complete domination I can remember.
---
 lol @ miners hire some muscle protection greedy carebears ;)
---
When I was about to hit 20b I donated 15b to my alt so I can't accept the worst scams. As for earning isk, I try to sell my loot from combat and relic sites by myself at a good price and I hold onto items that are on a low. I can't bother with spreadsheets, let alone indy or trader alts.
---
I support this idea.  Eventually, one of them will afk on a gate somewhere. 
---
You’re also correct haha, I love the feeling of danger everywhere.
---
Popular opinion: I’m not gay for THAT Jay
---
Grind more than your spending
---
This.
---
That’s also how I made my first bill when I first started playing within a week or two, since I found exploration really fun. Now I occasionally explore to make a few hundred mil just so I can stack up a little isk every now and then
---
Total impulse shopper here
---
&gt; But polarized still kills all your resists right?
---
It does. You fit differently though. You can go either hybrid active / passive, which actually works with enough slots thrown at it which you now have cause no need for any resist stuff, or just go pure active. 
---
Both take some skill to play, I like the pure active fit better myself.
---
detorid  = detroit and etherium reach = eatshit reach
---
How about limiting the number of accounts that can be plexed to 5? If you want more omega accounts you need to pay irl cash for the sub.
---
Spend it immediately on PvP ships, though I want to outright purchase some pilots and then put them on the skill farm for subs, so I may need to save up some ISK 
---
Did it cross your mind that fitting a few tank mods \*(that you were already carrying in your cargo hold)\* into your mid slots would be a good idea?
---
when i get above 6B i transfer 4B to my PI banking toon , if i need the money it is there if i dont it takes an extra 2 min to log out and log back in , if i am too drunk to do that i should probably not be making purchases.
---
Neither.
---
I never buy things impulsively and I'm an extreme miser when it comes to spending, but I also don't compulsively track it. I just have a small pile of isk that I slowly eat through to fund my (cheap) pvp, and when it gets too low and I haven't been getting enough loot to keep up I sigh and grit my teeth and force myself to do some sort of pve type thing to build it back up.
---
I just love how we get credited with all sorts of conspiracy theories. Whether they're true or not shouldn't get in the way of a good story! :)
---
Yeah probably not the brightest idea, especially without any warp stabilizers. 
---
Doesn't matter how many warp stabs you've got you'll just get bumped until you die. You take nearly a minute to warp.
---
Taking a freighter into low sec is just going to be death with anybody halfways competent on the other end.
---
Gilas will still be great for the abyss, you just need to be more mindful of the drones HP. You can carry enough replacements that losing a couple isn't a problem. You can also use faction droned instead of T2 for added EHP at the cost of dome DPS. The sacrilege and cerberus are other options that can run up to T5 sites, and I've herd of people using ishtars and munnins in lower tiers as well, though they are less common and a bit harder to make work.
---
Nahh, DNG has **WAAAAAAY** Better [IRL goods.](https://i.imgur.com/OvGw2z7.jpg)

---
Those were our 100 freighters
---
IMO a way CCP might have gone about this (if they had time/people/desire) is refunding policies on the date of the insurance changes. with amortization of the refund over days insured so people aren't getting more than they should have.
---
This would only apply to special cases like this and not the regular insurance payout changes that happen, because those are based on the market value of the ship (for t1 space vessels).
---
*The cap insurance changes are good,* but the "you get what you get and you don't get upset" insurance has definitely been a thing for a while, this is just the big change that everyone has noticed

Pretty much this 
---
 Throw it all at PLEX so I can have more than the other guy
---
who?
---
mfw this guy gets downvoted to fuck and back by anally agitated sjws for a factual statement
---
it would be as dumb and inconsiderate as referring to an "American" race, if not moreso -- there are issues of Actual Racism, systematic oppression and ethnically motivated violence within China and I really doubt members of these minority groups appreciate being lumped in with their oppressors
---
the terms you're looking for are probably nationality/nationalism, I know national identity isn't the resounding call to arms you were hoping for but you'll just have to get triggered by proxy with what you have
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Didn't you get kicked from tishu 
---
Tried asking in the in-game Help channel and other people say it works.  Is there some sort of cache I can clear to attempt to fix it, or will that also delete UI settings etc?  If the latter is the case, I won't bother.  I just like to use it from time to time for the daily bonus and fun.
---
Yeh i heard some people run them in Retributions?
---
So whenever you're done catching your own jizz in your mouth can you reconcile your implied position that "Chinese" is a race with the definition you've just provided and the fact that there are multiple culturally and genetically distinct ethnic groups in China?
---
Well if they aren't plexing then what the fuck does the price of plex have to do with the price they charge for isk if they are RMTing? One has nothing to do with the other unless plexing the account is involved.
---
I am honestly still amazed that we can still insure our ships.  
---
Every real insurance company would look at your record and be like "noooooope"....
---
can confirm, its super irritating but sometimes their bot breaks and I get a kill. little victories, i suppose
---
Serenity had no anti-bot measure. You are stupid to rely on undefined term like culture when very well defined terms make a good explanation.
---
Never heard of the casino war. 
---
Was that around the same time as World War Bee?
---
There is nothing to reconcile. The level of diversity within China's borders doesn't negate the \~1b+ Han Chinese the vast majority of people are referring to when they say "Chinese".  
---
 Han Chinese are the vast majority and are genetically and culturally similar. Are there other races in China? Sure. Are there genetically Han Chinese who don't have any cultural connection to China? Sure. Are they party to what anyone referred to as "Chinese"... not generally.   
---
I'm really not sure the argument here... China has a dominant, genetically groupable, culturally identifiable grouping of people and has for centuries... they are externally and internally identified as such... if Chinese isn't a race, then I challenge you to define one that is.
---
fuck the newbros
---
Yes, 1 and 3 is niche use. 2nd is not niche - it does everything i want combat t3c to do within that comp (decent facetank, decent sigtank, decent mobility, very good tackling capabilities including stopping MJDs, decent anti-fighter dps, decent anti-support dps at range).
---
&gt; which can be done better if you just decide to swap a weapon system or tank type or cloak. Remember Proteus is competing not just against other T3Cs but other ships too.
---
Sure, I understand that, and wrote my post with this idea in mind. If other ships can do it better, i would be happy to reconsider my decisions - show me specific fits. Until thay, I am sticking to proteus as to the best ship for my purposes.
---
Also, just to be clear - I realize that it's not very flexible and good ship, I wanted to show that it's optimal choice for more than 1 role. 
---
WTB exotic dancers in bulk. Price does not matter.
---
&gt; you want me to pvp? srp or gtfo.
---
lol
---
I always have enough liquid isk to buy the most expensive ship I fly. Other than that I impulse buy stuff, that I randomly think is gonna be my next thing to do in EVE. Doesn't always end up being a good decision, but at least then I know what things not to endeavor in 😅
---
I'm repeat
---
Ever considered going with an alternative like Isso or something? You'd still have the moderation effort of course, but at least your data is your own, and not something for disqus to profit from and shit all over.
---
Well, glad you stayed.  This guys are kind bad at Eve, but might be useful on your journey towards learning the game.
---
This fight was almost over before it has started.. Big shout out to the Volta guys bombed our main sub fleet :-/ fucking tunnels but the timing was great.. 
---
CCP has altered the deal, pray they don't alter the deal further.
---
Let me tell you my story. I am also someone who is anxious. When i started 2014 i just played for 3 months. I restarted the game in 2017. I wanted to try out pvp i made my way to Black rise. Just a cheap little atron with Meta fitting. Well i got instantly shot as soon as i entered low sec. What I did was asking the guys who killed me what i did wrong. Now we were in a conversation and soon after i was in a new corp. Took me a bit to get on teamspeak with them but it helped a lot knowing they wont be able to find out my real name or where i live so i wouldnt See them in real life. 
---
Now im shooting rorqs and carriers with great people having fun. Even started to get into FC ing etc. 
---
Just try it out talk to people and See what happens. They will never know your real Name or anything as long as you want to protect it.. 
---
Jesus. I hope that's satire.

The problem is that the amount of players with money seems to be exceeding the amount of players who have patience and time.  
---
There used to be a time when you needed to think about skills and people with logi 5 or heavy interdictor 5 were specialists who enjoyed doing their role, not just someone who could afford more skill injectors.  
---
About injecting the fleet of the month:  
---
Yeah fuck that, unless your alliance pays for the injectors. The fleet of the month also seems to be a lot more high skilled these days (assault frigates and cruisers), I acknowledge that it might also be just players training normally though, given that those Muninns and Eagles were Moas and Ruptures a while ago.  
---
I am definitely drawing the line at capital pilots who should not even be able to operate battleships properly given their age though.
---
You're not fully vested as a member of TEST until PGL has personally yelled at you at least once in a fleet.
---
I saw it, I will be sharing the poem with my corp because I loved it! thanks a lot for all the effort. Fly safe as well and I look forward to future deliveries.
---
oh cool another person beating their chest about how someone has bad idea and we should publicly keep telling people that we are against bad idea. Because if we don't explicilty say we're against raping children, then people might think we're for raping children. Solipsistic and infantile shit my dude. Racism is against the reddit TOS, report people, save your virtue signals for your twitter and face book please.

Never forget Tienanmen Square! Winnie the Pooh!

it's not. he probably represents the average nullbear now.
---
Assuming that you're not trolling, I'm going to recommend a Nightmare instead. Marauders main strength in PvE is Bastion. It gives not only massive tank buffs and ewar immunity but also a damage projection buff. If you don't want to sit still because that's not your playstyle (no one will gank you in a t2 fit CCC rigged paladin except on principle) the Nightmare is a great option with a massive afterburner bonus. Tachyon nightmares project excellently, and with the ab bonus their low tracking is a non-issue.
---
As for Deimos, it can do decently in Abyssal deadspace but the risk is like three orders of magnitude higher than turning on bastion in highsec, so that's something you'll have to consider.
---
Opps Eve mechanics working for some not working for others....

Great timing on the bombing run or planning.

Goddamn. Guess I'm glad I left nullbloc life then. Life is definitely more interesting lately.

Per 2010 census, the Uyghurs at 45.84%?
---
bears gonna bear anywhere man. wormbears are just as fucking bad. 
---
there's nothing wrong with making ISK in the game in order to fund your activities but when you're at the point where you won't play the game unless your ship is guaranteed to be replaced, then fuck, man, perhaps this game isn't for you.
---
Lol, how insecure do you have to be to not simply admit it?

Smartbombing shuttles on gates is already petty enough as it is, except for the the odd individual who hauls a vanquisher BPC in a condor. There is no need to make lowsec frig pvp unatractive by having to doubble warp every system.

Oh, believe me, I've noticed the WH bit. Half the people we roll into won't fight at all. But I'm here to PvP and politic, so it's made it more interesting that we can just roll and suddenly there are new people.
---
Found the covenant scum! 
---
"Chinese" is a national identity.  The Han refer to themselves as Han.  "Han Chinese" is a parallel construction to e.g. "African American" and incorporates both a racial and national identity.
---
Race isn't a particularly nebulous concept as you make it out to be.  Race is largely a genetic classification by pretty much every practical or academic definition.  Ethnicity enters the picture to convey identity when genetic distinction occurs without cultural distinction due to e.g. dilution, cultural adoption, or shared heritage without shared ancestry.  Ethnic identities which imply shared ancestry are without ambiguity racial identities, and this describes many of the ethnic groups which make up the population of China.
---
I know there are those who don't care for your post but being something of a shitposter myself, I have to tell you that I'm really pickin up what you're putting down here. Keep it up.

You make me dream :D
---
I dont really understand why insurance is a thing anyway. I do understand that it sucks when you paid the old fee and now get the new payout but as I see it there shouldnt be insurance in the first place. At least not as isk payout. At max i would say you can have a chance to recover a module or two with insurance that would otherwise get completely destroyed. Then sent to your homestation.
---
You have my condolences.  I too was there a year ago.  
---
My caracal gang got dropped by Rorqs today. It really does feel bad to be bad... :(
---
the fight was pretty much over, goon battleships were losing pretty badly so they reapproached the gate to try and wait out weapons timer and leave
---
unfortunately in 10% tidi, weapons timer takes 10 minutes to tick down, so dudes had plenty of time to notice and warp in a hyper rag at range to lance them
---
I can offer far better estimated payout rates than the default insurance company.  Simply contract me your ship and I'll return it to you fully insured, with an estimated payout rate of 110% of the total purchase price!

psst, want to buy some memes?
---
Proteus is still the only T3C with access to the Hyperspatial Optimiser.
---
For PVP, this makes it the only T3C that can be setup (+clone) to motor at 10au, align in 4 server ticks and still carry enough tank to safely crush a 700 dps ratting VNI. My current Proteus hull has 44 kill marks.
---
For PVE, I believe drone proteus was the ship of choice for Olemerca's billion-an-hour faction warfare LP mission farm.
---
Had to look it up because it also felt recent for me: it was almost six years ago.
---
It's not that I wont, but what reason do I have?
---
Number 72. Try a few hundred more my dude 
---
"Sorry my finger slipped I swear I meant to hit bridge not delet fleet"
---
If plex prices are high, you get more isk for your irl cash. That means for rmt to make the same level of income irl, they must sell more isk. Because they have to drop their prices to compete with ccp.
---
good post my guy
---
Fun, helping your corp and/or alliance out, i dont know? why do you play?
---
Weapon Upgrades and Advanced Weapon Upgrades.
---
cynabal 100%
---
security tags don't give faction standings
---
correct
---
in the future it's better to decline gallente missions against amarr unless you're using a dedicated puller toon (character specifically for accepting missions and nothing else)
---
that's what no chatter is for friend
---
You are right to be nervous for using bastion module in highsec. Check zkillboard and look at how many bling Paladin in highsec are ganked. All because of false sense of comfort highsec and bastion module give. Dont listen to other players that laugh at you for being paranoid. In EVE, everyone is out to get you and you can never be paranoid enough. Those gankers are trying to lure you to use bastion in highsec and destroy you.. stay safe brother..
---
to expound, if you haven't spent much time blowing stuff up yet, people are gonna be a bit skeptical of you as an applicant unless their corp isn't very good and really needs more people
---
to get into a group that's really worth being in, in eve, you're gonna want a good killboard history (which comes from being active and doing pvp), and you're gonna want at least a few people to kinda have a concept of who you are - most high end pvp groups have a vouch system for recruitment so you wanna get your name out there
---
horde doesn't have any barrier to entry, and there's a lot of pvp content to be enjoyed, so it's a great place to get your start in eve. that and, you might find you enjoy it and want to stick around - people are increasingly making horde their forever home
---
Aww yiss!
---
Star Wars quotations always bring the child in me out...
---
I always have between 1 and 10b. When I loose a cruiser I do one C6 site and buy a new one.
---
Snake pod is 3 sites.
---
i had heard people make specific toons for doing the missions due to the standing loss.
---
im trying to find out how to repair standing in a sustainable way. tried some missions over the weekend with a lowsp alt. sharing standing etc. ive now noticed that only the storyline missions give the standing im after that way. 
---
due to the tag hand ins only being able to be used once or at least a limited number of times its not sustainable.
---
the puller toon method sounds like a simple way of achieving it. but although it makes me seem lazy i would like to not have to travel with 2 toons to be able to warp my level 5 runner into the sites.
---
Hisec gankers are just players who failed at everything and still haven’t quit... and yet I can’t hate them cause their targets are idiots 99% of the time so I’m giving this a +1 
---
its not something like that, there is plenty of countermesures to prevent that. if i do that and get caught which is likely, my steam accoutn will be rekt. instead of burning entire forest down they could added something like (only local credits cards accepted) or  they could asked to steam for improvement.
---
so this is the solution they figured it out? i really want to which employer came up witch such idea, like snake said at peace walker "i wanna shake his hand"
---
&gt; due to the tag hand ins only being able to be used once or at least a limited number of times its not sustainable.
---
yep that is why people make pullers
---
&gt;but although it makes me seem lazy i would like to not have to travel with 2 toons to be able to warp my level 5 runner into the sites.
---
that is unfortunate because that is how you do it
---
&gt;tried some missions over the weekend with a lowsp alt. sharing standing etc
---
all missions give standing, but storylines give significantly more. pick up some glamourex booster (should be tanking in price due to recently announced expiration date) to increase your standings gains on your alt, and don't forget to train some social skills - social, connections, and security connections are a good starting point for a mission puller
---
I might make this. If I can get a few things lined up maybe you all can see my atrocious golf skillz.

Cybernetics to allow you rocket implants.

Oh shit...not sure if you are trolling but aint Brave part of Test?? or is it Brave the creator of Legacy? or is it Test that own the Legacy crap? or who is it?? You guys should fight for that tittle.....but why you posting this?? i tough brave was on that fight??? couldnt see thru stream tho
---
imagine thinking this was a good post in 2019
---
I don't have any clue why I'm getting downvoted, if you don't believe me, here is a screenshot:

https://picr.ws/d/5G7.png
---
He also said that the price for ad-free packages was too high, which also played a role. But yeah, downvote, what doesn't fit your narrative, guys. 
---
Na they got kicked out of FRT space lol
---
cuz we are laughing, it was glorious fight and we had similar bomb run in brave some time ago from Horde, worthy of all memes
---
clearly not, does not make me wrong tho.
---
I dont. Which is why I’m always poor.
---
fuck chinks
---
Ship skills with rocket bonuses and Thermodynamics.
---
Hyper inflation due to monopolies ss well as military tactics to get rid of other producers.
---
I really enjoy Fozzie Sov both for the 10 man gang troll entosis in unused renter space and the theory around balancing mobility, attrition and large scale force multipliers (bombers and lances etc) as seen in detorid yesterday on the “big jobs” and the fact it makes dick waving really hard for any force worth their salt by spreading fights out.
---
As far as my gripes with the current system it seems silly that a system has 2.0 adm can be hit at the edge of any Timezone but rng forces when its event comes out so it can be awful event timer for interested attackers anyways.
---
The other thing is citadels are really counter intuitive to how sov is fought and provide far juicier targets than the sov itself.
---
Sov ultimately only holds value as 1 of 2 ways to disable cyno jammers and in niche examples allowing easy citadel proliferation by resetting anchor timers to 24 hours. The actual cost of losing a fully upgraded ihub is completely inconsequential to the keep in that system.
---
Rapid lights
---
The biggest tip I have is that when you buy something, you should expect to hold onto it until you lose it or use it. Lots of money is lost in market transactions from sales tax and broker's fee, and I bet you it makes up a significant chunk of your spent cash and you just don't notice.  
---
All good fun tbh, only the very few that take this game way too serious are upset about all this shit. 
---
I’m here just for the space explosions, whether it’s my ship or other people’s ships.
---
Speaking of lore, how do reinforcement timers factor into it and yet ships dont have them.
---
You think the technology would be integrated, certainly into things that have siege modules (i understand this would be horrible, but what is the explanation for it?)
---
I dont care about lore a whole lot but the answer would be interesting to me as the mechanics of eve are.
---
You forget about the second problem which is the option to make isk semi-afk...
---
Like you can use a rorqual making 80-140 (depending on what you sell it/post nerf) and watch netflix or whatever as long as you have one guy on comms who warns you about neutrals or rats in the belt
---
Or you can use a drone boat (vni, gila, etc.) and go semi-afk for 20 minutes as long as you have someone who warns you about incoming neutrals.
---
It makes no sense nowadays to make isk in any other way since you can't scale those like the two ways mentioned above. The only limit it literally your pc... 
---
Military tactics I understand would be stopped. Would governments force people to give up their stock of items to break up monopolies? 
---
Scammed by NPCs? Classical EVE spirit! I approve of this move!
---
yes
---
are you that dense??
---
Not that there are no bots in RMT and BOT but judging them just because the ticker?
---
It was a gallente industrial ship, nereus, not a freighter. I guess freighters are worth  a lot more. Sorry, still pretty new to the game. Either way it seems like a good idea to avoid level 3+ distribution missions that involves hauling stuff to nullsec for a measly 100k isk. 
---
Implying this data won't be published by some player literally that day.
---
Russian prices are also higher now
---
Cons:
---
Sometimes your neighbor is Tevo.
---
exactly Syndicate really drove that home that you try to do anything and every northern alliance brings 2 full fleets to a fort timer. if i remember correctly even MC came with a full fleet of Macs.
---
so if you have no friends you will forever have your shit pushed in by every titan fleet forever.
---
Ever heard of antitrust law and what happens when you violate it?

PLEX prices have very little to nothing to do with skill extractors right now. If lots of people were buying extractors, PLEX market volume would react to this. It really has not changed much throughout its history of going up in price.  If you want evidence, check out EVEMarketer's cluster wide PLEX market volume.  
---
Funny enough, injectors have gone down in volume a bit since the lowest granual PLEX has been, where injectors were at a peak. (There was a big dump in january but the plex market didn't start going up until early febuary, and only going out of control in mid-to-late march)  
---
Very likely prices are due to a very large number of factors, but the granularity, market manipulation, and who's buying IRL are probably the biggest culprits.   
---
OP, if you're going to talk about the market you could atleast... like, open the market? You don't even need to be ingame ffs.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I just send it to my market toon and keep it until I feel like I can spend some of it on random shit
---
I'd like to add onto this by saying that the vast majority of bots use alpha's, not omega's, which is why they're suddenly more prevalent. Botters are gonna spent a cent on them if they use them for RMT or are running a ton of them. That's why there's so many bot VNIs with navy drones or FW bots in t1 fit atrons. 
---
Can confirm 
---
Well once we have gotten a Ferra titan trapped and I warped to our only cloaked hictor... and it was PGL.
---
What makes the Avatar the most used Titan? It has more deaths than any other Titan and also the most kills out of all of them so I figured it gets fielded a lot more in comparison.
---
I get the Armor doctrin for Supercaps in PvP so your tank can't get neuted and Slave Implants have an advantage since Genolution for Shield is memeworthy. But are the other Titans that shit? I thought Lasers are a bad weapon system.
---
It is usually not allowed to openly buy and sell exotic dancers or weapons of mass destruction.
---
Yes again, I challenge you where you can hear "Don't report botting goons" it's literally a few sec at the beginning "do not report on your fellow goons because we had this issue a lot of times people would see "oh they are totally botting they are totally doing this" we had actually a problem and we don't know if we resolve this yet but some self-righteous douchebag decided to report everybody that he thought was a multiboxing not even saying that this guy are botting just saying "oh my god they are running multiple account that bad"", Should I keep transmit what is say in this video or you can do the effort to actually listen the video, understand what he say and stop being in denial to not even see what he say ? 
---
I can give you an example of why I think he is right, I'm a director and I had some corp mate who used to rat in the same system, and they were this Chinese guy, he had a weird behavior, ratting all the day etc, they were spamming "duuuuh 100% bot look he come from FRT" they all report him to CCP, CCP (after few weeks ah it's CCP) answer them "We did some background check, this guy is 100% legit" 
---
Jesus fuck has it been that long. 
---
Ah well he still could have come back from a break.
---
Please explain that to my fellow Goons, we get super cheap Titans (sub 40b per hull) and supers (sub 12b per hull, discounted for multi-buys). Hell...Dreads are almost 1b/hull these days.
---

---
Capital ownership has NEVER been so CHEAP
---
Is there a BoB one or am I missing it?
---
Corps don't have territory in hi sec. That is your first mistake. If you want territory, go to null like everyone else. Or, just play like you always have in hi sec, nothing has really changed. In fact, the recent changes are actually better for smaller corps.
---
look at the new patchnotes  [https://www.eveonline.com/article/pphodr/patch-notes-for-april-2019-release](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pphodr/patch-notes-for-april-2019-release)

good now repent before your new overlord Pythagoras, delete every rasterized vector drawing in your possession and come with me through the time portal please
---
The Explicit Alliance and the rest of the former DRF pets were but a bunch of bads trying to come up with an attitude. Small groups of people had already collapsed large portions of the dronelands entities for fun, when Fozziesov appeared. V0LTA Urself collapsed all of DRF's holdings last years. Now the Goons are looking for easy wins in one of the few regions of the game that they didn't set blue or NIP, it was only a matter of time before they got to try their hands at it, too. Plus it's good narrative because held by Our Enemies (tm)

*shakes fist* My grandfather fought a war to stop people like you!
---
What HS "territory"? And why do you think there won't be anyone you can hire for protection?
---
so skillU and Snuff share the haram for girls ?
---
I'm playing because there's a bunch of passive, fire and forget, type of things to do. Which suits my limited and erratic play times.
---
I joined a pvp fleet yesterday. I knew it would be a long one. Which meant I had to pick between the fleet, or going to the gym.
---
I decided to do the fleet, and at the end when back in the station... I thought 'That wasn't anything special, I should've gone to the gym'.
---
So, if you want me to PvP... I better be getting something out of it, cos I definitely have better things to do with my time.
---
did u try squinting
---
Where can I buy one of these GF drawers?
---
Increasingly smaller corps are positioning POCO in hi sec to make a bit of ISK.  Lots of tiny little drama playing out in the back ways.  Up until now hiring a merc corp to dec your enemies was a valid tactic - but merc corps are now not willing to put up a structure in order to fight other corps wars.  Being one of those mercs - I don't see any option for small PvP corps to survive anymore.
---
gimmick faction shit game fuck you
---
Being a wiseass is half the reason why you see the back of our hand so often... \*hic\*
---
I was thinking of small systems with POCO.  My char is in one of the corps for hire - but it looks like we will be unwilling to defend a structure of our own to fight a war for someone else.   Consensus of opinion in my small group is: join a larger alliance or fade away.   I am looking for options.
---
&gt; merc corps are now not willing to put up a structure in order to fight other corps wars
---
lol ok
---
I donate it all to the RNG Jesus in Yita 4-4
---
Thats pretty neat data!
---
I was paying something like u$d 3 for sub. They mailed me with the new price and charge for it at the same day for the new price of almost u$d 8. It's almost 3 times what i was paying... They shouldn't mail me and charge before i could cancel the sub. That was low. (This is Latin America)
---
LoL...
---
It looks that Dodixie is going the same path...
---
yep
---
Have they fixed these icons on 90% scaling yet?
---
Last I played was a few years ago and they all looked the same on 90%.
---
price rigging, cornering a market, spoofing, front-running...
---
If you cant defend your own structure why would anyone hire you to attack smth. Nullsecerd are going after peri, noone gives a fuck about some rando high sec poco. 
---
haha look mom they used a unit of measurement from my videogame on the twitter
---
He's in Karmafleet.  That engagement with the corp and Alliance doesn't lend itself to massive massive blocs where you're a nameless pilot whose presence won't be turning the tide of battle.
---
i made 2bill this weekend. in lowsec. with one toon.
---
makes me wonder why the current plex prices actually bother anyone.
---
Boo hoo. So you want to hide if out formed, only popping out for easy structure kills, never actually risking anything. Got it.
---
You gonna take this abuse Jay!?
---
Heresy!!!
---
Seizing stock is a bit of an extreme measure.
---
Straight from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law): 
---
Competition law, or antitrust law, has three main elements:
---
1) prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business. This includes in particular the repression of free trade caused by cartels.
---
2)banning abusive behavior by a firm dominating a market, or anti-competitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position. Practices controlled in this way may include predatory pricing, tying, price gouging, refusal to deal, and many others.
---
3)supervising the mergers and acquisitions of large corporations, including some joint ventures. Transactions that are considered to threaten the competitive process can be prohibited altogether, or approved subject to "remedies" such as an obligation to divest part of the merged business or to offer licenses or access to facilities to enable other businesses to continue competing.
---
Thank you, that'll really help getting newbies up to speed with the overview.
---
Dear customer service,
---
I have tried this a lot and usually don't get any reply. Also I'm usually not in need of torpedoes but other ammunition. Whenever I engaged in a conversation with your agents, I show them what type of ammunition I need. Sometimes I send drones to inspect their selection of wares but get heavily disappointed. The agent usually just leaves never to be heard of again. 
---
I expect better service.
---
I spreadsheet the stuff I plan on buying and throw the ISK randomly at it
---
No because I'm stupid.
---
How is that the new ? What changed ?
---
Wait u/Dran_Arcana joined Theran to ask himself for rent ?? hmmm what a Masterplan, only Sgeine could figure this out. 
---
More relevant things? like what ? losing more fortizars? I mean GOTG is your first good choice since they have the same fetish for forti's.
---
lol stupid noob do u have any idea how much effort it takes to make back my ship losses on my belt ratting drake i dont think so you probably never got in real fight mining in hisec lol
---
Following that logic everyone should join one major group in any region of space. Why don't you guys try not to be risk averse fucks?
---
Great work! Are you a russian speaking group?
---
Are you playing so your passive income can plex your account so you can collect more passive income to continue to plex your account? If so, that seems very...shallow and repetitive. I dunno. Maybe you're into that sort of thing.
---
Regarding long fleets and structured, timed PvP: They really aren't anything special. A structure grind here, a staring contest there, maybe a battle every so often. That's frequent with large fleets like that, but there's nothing that says that should be your EVE experience.
---
Grab yourself a cheap Jaguar, fit it the way Suitonia does, and go roam Esoteria. Maybe you'll get some VNI kills, maybe you'll frag a gatecamping sabre, maybe you'll eat shit to a titan boson camp...but I guaran-damn-tee you're going to have some fun.
---
Hell, pod yourself to highsec, grab a battleship and go to Tama. Maybe you can break up the ever-lasting gatecamp there, maybe not. 
---
Just go do something. Don't be another NPC-like robot.
---
Well, values/measurements check out at least 
---
 Very poorly 
---
Meme's aside, This is really fucking cool.
---
No, I'm playing because I enjoy those activities. The reward comes from the planning, not tedious repetitive grinding like most other games.
---
Yeah, grabbing a frigate and killing ratters sounds like a massive waste of my time, and there's nothing in it for me.
---
vOv
---
Bears gonna Bear
---
I have a big box that I put it in. A really big box.
---
It's not a question of risk - more - how can a corp defend someone elses structure - if you are defending your own.   If i was averse to risk I'd just join a big alliance.
---
I think that u're so fucked up in your head, that you can literally make this shit up. 
---
Don't even need vpn's if you launch your alpha clients at the same time they login anyway.
---
Seems to be a delay on the server detection. Sure bots are taking great advantage of it.
---
The Voltron eagle fleet with the russian machs was actually doing pretty good against NC/PH/PL munnins. Too bad it was cut short due to TEST getting bombed and Goons getting lanced. :X
---
&gt;but merc corps are now not willing to put up a structure in order to fight other corps wars.
---
that's called bait and its been a thing for a decade. The only reason you were able to compete with larger corps  at all is they were unable to estimate ahead of time how large your neutral logi and boosting wing would be. Stop crying that game mechanics no longer favor out of corp coward alts and either move to low/nullsec and fight for real territory or start grinding missions for your isk.
---
&gt;how can a corp defend someone elses structure - if you are defending your own
---
by not being afraid to fight?
---
How successful are you with this fitting and implants in T5s?
---
I already tried several t5 runs on the test server with a 10b gila+pod and a 6b Sacrilege+pod.
---
The sacrilege would often die because of the time limit, the gila performs a bit better timewise but for a 10b gila it is more than often too close to the time limit for my tastes.
---
literally makes no sense
---
If your so called "mercs" don't want to put up a structure they can't defend, why do you want to hire them in the first place ?
---
ok, ill bite. give me a song.
---
This thread looks like some ill-conceived false-flag attempt at "BUT THINK OF THE NEWBS THAT WANNA PVP" when you're probably just one of the idiots that's mad that it's become a lot harder to sit in jita and farm those same noobs.
---
Uh, I run T4 Darks and Exotics perfectly fine with time to spare. Running T5s requires faction ballistic control system but it runs T5 Darks and Exotics just fine with those too. I also like to take the DB5% if I get a hard spawn too.
---
If you're dropping 6b or 10b on a single cruiser to run T5s, you're doing it horribly, horribly wrong.
---
If defending your structures is too much to ask how can you base your existence on defending someone else structures? Your way of life makes no sense.
---
Literally it does oO
---
Hmm
---
Not sure how asking a question = crying. or where neut logi comes into it. but I would be interested in where you see a small pvp corp could fit in low/nullsec.  Hence my question  " is there anywhere left for small corps that wanna PVP?"    maybe i just can't see your reasoned answer through my tears.
---
nice, thx!
---
Drone specs to 4 are more than enough.
---
&gt; do not report on your fellow goons
---
case closed mangobrain, pack it up
---
Sounds to me like "I log in once a month, Plex my Alts and then go the Gym"
---
Weapon Upgrades, and Advanced Weapon upgrade. help with fitting.
---
what ship and fit?
---
target painter sub skill in electronics
---
the respective ship class skills that can increase range and damage per level when flying that ship
---
mostly all the Engineering skills help with things like fitting
---
someone has already mentioned Thermodynamic to overheat for longer.
---
i mean, how far do you go?
---
use rocket boosting drugs, whats your biology and other drug related skills at?
---
i think ive covered a few, hopfully it helps :D
---
Try reading it again, then.
---
because we are not afraid to fight - we just cant fight at 2 places at once. Fear has nothing to do with it - it's resources.  Which is why I say it looks like "the only way to play is 'be in a big alliance'"
---
Aren't c6 sites hard? 
---
Triage carrier, lol...someone's still in 2014.
---
Eh, if PvP was more interesting or worth while, I'd do it more.
---
not sure anything in his hold wouldve made it tank the nado shot, and if it did survive theres another nado shot behind it.
---
Use 'Haulers Channel'
---
and get your stuff there 0 risk. its worth the isk :D
---
That's kind of my point - looks like that way of playing is dead.  Im not keen on joining a large hi sec war dec alliance so looking for options for small corps
---
Can you tell me again what's the difference with before ?
---
&gt; I would be interested in where you see a small pvp corp could fit in low/nullsec
---
Just like all the small corp are doing : Harassing other entities, roaming to find targets, allying with other to fight off bigger entities, being the bait for larger fish etc.
---
Ammo probe launchers dictor bubbles open the lp store and add things you cant get from it.
---
the normal missions i did for an amarr corperation didnt affect the standing for the faction, 'amarr'
---
so i was hoping to get to my next storyline mission, complete it and share with my gallante alt and hopefully my amarr standings go up.
---
yes yes :)
---
If some corp, for defence/aggression whatever, wanted to hire a merc corp for a hi sec war dec it was relatively easy.  With the changes to war dec mechanics the opinion of people i fly with is it will be hard to be aggressive while at the same time defending home base.  wether their opinion is right or wrong I can't really comment.  But the tendency is for them to join larger alliances.   Which left me wondering where the small corp PvP is now.
---
Nice 👌 dogwhistle 👌 dawg 👌 haha 👌 cryptofascism 👌 is 👌 cool 😎
---
 Can you recommend any areas? or even any corps?
---
🙏
---
Hey I read that you are already in CVA, but which corp are you part of? Because I recently joined CVA in the new corp of Lasker, Knight Odds, and it was a very amazing change from PH before that. It's amazing to see a new Corp grow and develop and being part of it. Would be an easier switch than to something far away. Maybe you want to try it for a month or smth and see if it fits
---

That's literally what everyone else in the game has to do and everyone is doing fine. If your war target pull up a fight and try to kill your HQ and it's at the same timer than one of the structures you want to kill, then prioritize your defense obviously. But I don't see what's wrong with that, if you're a smaller corp wanting to hit bigger corp, that's bound to happen. If you go into LS or NS and try to destroy a larger corp/alliance structures, they will come and try to kill yours.
---
All EVE PvE is easy and boring when you have the right setup and know how to use it.
---
FW LS areas have plenty of people roaming for fights, and NS is literally full of ratters you can hunt and defense fleet to fight off. That's literally how everyone that isn't doing structure bashing is playing the game.
---
The Bleak Lands. I’ve lived here basically forever and it will always be close to my heart.

The only role the Proteus does well is smartbomb fit. It’s kinda garbage or outclassed at literally everything else.

Wow can you teach me? 
---
I always knew Elon Musk would like to oversize prop his ships...
---
Btw if you're on desktop, just delete the 'mobile' from the link and it should work fine.
---
Why he shot a lance? Wouldn't a boson be much better in this situation?
---
You are saying every single time you take a contract someome will reinforce your structure at the exact same time every single timer? Really?
---
Man, I've heard HS "Mercs" were a joke, but you are just overdoing it.
---
so find out what the timer is for the people you are defending and set yours yo something else...

How does one origin guy line up his lance perfectly, but 20 test rags cant hit with their bosons or lances for shit?
---
Well, the people using these 6b or 10b fits say if you are not doing it like them you are doing it horribly, horribly wrong too. So i hope you understand my confusion/skepticism when seeing all kinds of t5 abyssal fits.
---
That's why i try everything on the test server beforehand.
---
Honestly can’t live without it
---
Take me upvote!
---
No arguments from me.
---
Yeah when I first joined init they enlightened me by telling me to train command dessie V. It has really changed my life 
---
Rule 1, recruit people with Command Dessi 5. 
---
Rule 2, if you must have someone without, get it trained. 
---
Yeah, might as well go watch paint dry if you don’t have command dessie V. By far the most useful and versatile skill in the game, really changed my life 
---
I knew I liked you... 
---
Yeah here's the thing man, you can overbling anything and claim it's the best ever. I personally like to have the cheapest, most efficient ship for the job. 
---
Think of it like this - people fit officer damage mods in highsec incursions to squeeze out that extra 20 DPS when T2 ones work perfectly fine.
---
Hi there.
---
I'm exploring drone regions from a few days already. I found a celestial beacon called "Rogue Drone Sites". As i warp in, there is a crusier and a Battleship rat, and that is all.
---
I've looked un YouTube people ratting there for a good amount of rats Even in low sec systems. What i'm missing for making spawn the rats?
---
Sry for my English. XD
---
o7
---
I only have 20 freighter alts... Need to up my game...
---
You're complaining about pvp being boring while only participating in mass fleets to get paps.
---
Bears gonna bear.

Deep down aren't we all bots anyway

http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=New_Eden_Crew_Guidelines
---
Since there is no source material linked, i call BS, and chose to believe that there is no crew on a capsuleer piloted ship. Most of it's imput also can be automated anyway (bots, bots everywhere!), so I don't see any reason why we need them in this futuristic setting.
---
An example would be if you had the only supply of the ore to make steel and decide to team up with the only foundry that produces steel. They you all decide what price steel is now worth and now the customer has no input because there is zero alternatives. 
---
It's not that hard to smell ashes.
---
I personally use Proteus for exploration. My requirements are being fast in regular sites, while being able to run (and tank) superior sleeper sites easily (including last room). As all explo items are mid slots, i am left with low slots T3Cs. And Proteus just performs in this role better. (Just to make it more obvious, i carry second set of fitting for those tanky needs)
---
The grr goons on /r/eve is so strong that there is no point in trying to show the angry pubbies how the quote is taken out of context.
---
Just like that absolute monkey who replied to you did; they always go "Mittani said dont report goons!" and completely ignore everything he said before and after those words.
---
Simple graphics are sexy

Like I said. I'll gladly participate in PvP when there's something in it for me.

I Think they mean skin. The blood raider victory ship looks Really legit

---
He told you the answer
---
So basically the OP wants CCP to lose a ton of omega accounts, which forms the backbone of their budget.  
---
I'm thinking that the OP is trying to kill the game completely.
---
And saying that extractors caused a drop in numbers is hilarious.  OP needs to learn a bit about causality before coming up with hare brained ideas.
---
Because then he can hit them all from 200km~ rather than being inside the bubbles right next to the battleship fleet. 
---
That's the same war. Different nicknames for the same thing. 
---
No thanks, jewing is far more accurate.

Spend it all as fast as i can, no fun ships i need then just waste it on making abyssal mods.
---
You know they could actually make caracal navy interesting by making it the desired RLM or Heavy Assault Missile platform. 
---
AFs are on the strong side atm and people tend to fly cheaper smaller stuff, so it’s pretty natural for them to be the go to ship.
---
Use ghsol to deliver from jita to low 
---
Harpy is a really common fleet, Hawk is still pretty good for small gang stuff and amazing for Heavy Tackle.
---
As to your other question, surely Assault Frigates are the premier of frig size fleets?
---
Faction Frigs are still pretty popular but at fleet level AFs are the king, as they probably should be. Interceptor fleets are also pretty common
---
What do you consider a "microfleet"?
---
Small gangs are still using many ships that are not AFs (although the Retri is very popular in small gangs)
---
Interesting
---
" *The 'Sell' button in the Sell PLEX window is now deactivated if the player cannot afford the Broker's fee.* "
---
I hope it will hit the right players, those with **neg** ISK.
---
I guess direct trade will still be possible...
---
Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by stupidity.
---
cheater, the Merlin don't have 22 mids
---
How come Harpy is used more in fleets than in smaller gangs of 1-3?
---
2019 and caring about losses. smh
---
My main collects all my escalation loot/PI/reactions/etc and ships it to my jita alt.  My jita alt "buys" everything from my main at around 30% of the price; I usually just eyeball it.  
---
So that 30% is my do whatever the hell I want isk and the 70% is my bank and I reinvest some of that into spinning up new reaction lines or some station trading
---
Has a resist bonus and is hybrids so can hit out pretty far, whereas the hawk has a shield boost bonus so is a tougher nut in small gangs.
---
They are both used in small gangs tbf, but in large fleets the harpy is used far more.
---
I tend to be stingy with my isk but recognize that, if there's something I really want for whatever reason (most recently a cordite blossom skin) I recognize I can blow a few hundred mil on it. If your income is really consistent over time, spreadsheeting is a good way to go, but since mine is super variable, I dont bother. 
---
That being said, I *do* budget fot sets of ships that I can just buy and use as I want. For example, when I get to x amount of isk, I use it to buy like 5 fitted ships. 
---
For the optimal small fleet, should I go with the retribution? Seems a lot of people fly that. I don't know why it's better than the other AF tho.
---
How does it compare to the Saturn V? I realize thats no longer operational, but it was the most powerful rocket used, right?
---
&gt;is there anywhere left for small corps that wanna PVP?
---
Yes, they are called wormholes.
---
Retri doews well because it has good tank, great damage up close and pretty good projection with Scorch.
---
Yeh its pretty good atm, kinda sucks as primary tackle because it only has 2 mids but still pretty solid.
---
You guessed correctly that armor is largely preferred because shields are vulnerable to neuts - this eliminates the Minmatar and Caldari options from the pool. Comparing the Avatar and Erebus, the Avatar has an additional low slot (8 versus 7), which lets it access more tank. It's that simple.
---
Of course, some people will fit an armor tank to their Ragnarok, and the meta overall is shifting towards a mixed armor/shield fleet and even dual-tanked titans for the massive set-piece fights such as X47, as they are fought at ranges where neuts aren't an issue, and guns are largely irrelevant since the majority of the damage is dealt via massed doomsday volleys.

The first job must be done by ceo. As a ceo you can know if someone is botting or no because you see the tic in the corp wallet. 
---
Player should also stop buying isk from botter. Less customer, less earning, less bot.
---
Report the bot to ccp but dont forget to ceo / diplomat / boss of alliance too.

This is confusing, what I can tell you is that 100% in the actual EVE work of fiction Tony Gonzalez's *Eve Series* books, capsuleers pilot a number of large ships where *they* are the only crew members; however, other parts of the lore (as we can see from your post) suggest that ships have crews even when piloted by a capsuleer. 
---
Replacing yourself is one of those fundamental foundations of a functional society.  Unless you want to be working until you die, someone has to keep the lights on when you get old.

Even if you want to work until you die, someone has to keep the civilization going.

So can you explain if possible how this would take effect in eve if hypothetically it was implemented by ccp

And Turkey wanted to join the EU. Well, with this attitude I can see why this has not happened yet.

there are alot of viable and good ships out there to roam.
---
with the buff to ass frigs and the ''we drop supers on everything that moves'' mentality, ass frigs are just a good choice to roam without having to care if you get camped in or if you instantly get dropped on by supers.
---
No, I cannot. Besides, why would it need to be implemented into the game? It's a sandbox. T2 mat cartels like the old early 2010s OPEC are beautiful examples of what makes EVE special.
---
Of course, i just wanted an idea of how it would be different so it's easier to visualize
---
False advertising of contracts

EVE is the best game on Twitch.
---
Poorly.
---
I build up over time and spend slower than I build...I also steal small expensive things from corp ops but hush hush.
---
Brave, we need more people that create content like this
---
One small thing. If you loot a scatter container, but don’t take everything, it still shows up as the “empty” icon on the overview, even though it isn’t empty. Maybe change that to looted?
---
I really like wormhole symbol. Good job
---
Aw shit I better dock up the faction titans.
---
Money Shot^^^tm
---
Stargate is easily the most annoying icon CCP have drawn.  It's really hard to identify against the backdrop of other citadel spam.  It needs to be circular, more like a stargate.  Right now it's kind-of rounded-rectangle, which is very, very close to... rectangle.

Anyway this is nice.  Thanks for sharing.

I like to look at my balance and resist the temptation to spend it all on injectors because "I want to do X now".  For example, injecting a Rorq so I can join Locust Fleet.
---
On calm reflection it'll take me about 50 weeks to break even, so naturally I don't do it.  So many people don't consider these things.  In 50 weeks I will have passively trained up a character to do it in any case, for free (well, subs only).
---
because fighters apply near perfectly against everything. and there are support fighter that tackle better than the ships that were designed for that role.

in other words, they are basically the best against everything.

It would likely involve a player-staffed, CCP-run oversight organisation - probably something akin to the ISD program, with access to tools that enable it to audit alliance/corp/player wallets and assets, and to apply economic pressure on specific individuals or organisations through targeted taxation, fines, asset freezing, docking rights denial or possibly even concord/npc enforcement in certain areas of space.
---
As things are, EVE's economic systems aren't developed enough to implement something like this, and CCP doesn't have the resources to develop and oversee any of this.
---
Praise Bob, brothers! You will go strong.
---
I have a degree in underwater basket weaving and based on my experience I’m gonna go with no.
---
Not sure, to be honest. Not a ganker, that's just what I saw as the reasoning. Maybe it's because people are likely to try and blap scanning ships, and a Blackbird is much more able to just be left AFK safely on a gate as compared to a Heron/Imicus?
---
Okay that sounds epic...  As if the Palantine isn't hard enough to build... A Titan built out of PI entirely? Oh and it has to come from a shattered planet, oh and it has the be the same planet harvested precisely in the right amount before the planet blows up lol.... 
---
Only one group currently that could pull off the Palantine and even for goons it would take some serious effort... Then try to imagine the drama around building the Kawa and who gets to fly it lol.... PLEASE make it happen I need to see this.
---
oh come on... capital ship after capital ship and you dont post your ign so we can check your killboard? dude... we need to see that
---
im replying to you. not to OP. and yes he is very low skilled. but getting a battleship isn't that hard these days. while you just have to train up for about a week.   
---
i know this because i have done exactly what im talking about.   
---
\- was running missions and mining in HS for a almost a month since ive joined the game. &lt; 2 mill SP    
---
\- invited in to a WH corp. got evicted in a month of joining. lost everything. &lt; 4 mill SP    
---
\- sold evey scrap i owned and brought a dominx to mission run. lost it to war dec. &lt; 4 mill SP  
---
\- stared running level 1 missions and up saved up. and got the dominix back. &lt; 4.5 mill SP  
---
\- found out about Warp to Me. browsed the new bro fits. still like a week away from sitting on one. started training. while mission running. 2 weeks later i passed the entry threshold and then some because of RL.   
---
\- joined the 1st fleet. with the existing dominx refitted. &lt; 1 a minute i wait list.   
---
\- 3 weeks later brought a Vindi. and skill injected in to proper skills.   
---
\- few weeks of running around HS. incursion running . trying to pvp a oracle with a arbi in ammar undoc.   
---
\- joined the same corp form earlier. now in null sec. got a rattlesnake and some pvp ships from the incursions money . lost the rattler on day 1 in null sec. 
---
\- vni ratting. got the rattler back. saved up injected in to a carrier. got bored in a week. injected in to a Proteus. run brought 10/10s. saved up got a rorq alt. started building caps.
---
\-  running incursions in null sec.  
---
\- was on the pilot project of sptree fleet t3 incursions.   
---
\- yada yada yada. now the XO of the corp. back in WHs. and still to date running incursions . while multi-boxing c5 fleets. 
---
now tell me, getting in to incursions communities is hard and or ships are hard. ill throw a sheet of my carrier in bullet points in to their faces. may be or may be not with a brick inside the paper. 
---
You want to self-stock a station to be a 'trade hub?' Go to Jita, buy some of everything.

I love how he has no concept of range of his guns.

---
Phenomenal shot... I was dual boxing a mega and bhaal on the gate at zero lol... When I saw the spool we had started deagressing but had 50-60 seconds left. Both guys at zero I clicked to pull them away from the gate mega took full dmg every tick, bhaalgorn managed to only take a bit. Mega was full health (minus shields of course) and got out with 30% hull and nearly burnt out hardeners.  (Oh and I had faction plates on cause why not, maybe the difference in surviving?)
---
What a fun battle even tho we ate shit the whole time lol....
---
Why build one palantine when you can build something like 25 keepstars
---
&gt;ay I can inject a new char which negates the training time however costs (for my ecenomic situation) a pretty penny.
---
It has absolutely *nothing* to do with 'advantage.' Don't believe me? Go check the prices on the character bazaar. My 125 million skill point character with perfect Gallente and Minmatar super carrier skills, and near flawless subcap skills is worth fuck all compared to what it was worth prior to injectors.   
---
See the time invested to get the character to a particular point, or to fill a particular roll, used to have considerable economic value... and now a character is essentially worth a little more than the extract value because of the 'injected' skill books. 
---
See... with injectors, people can just bypass the investment of time and the value of precision, well planned, training, by just buying injectors and injecting a character to taste. Thus, *my* characters have been devalued.   
---
A person with isk, via the character bazaar could *always* have negated the 'advantage' of my character's skill points with isk. Nothing has really changed there. 
---
I have been in contact with my space lawyer
---
who
---
Why not both?
---
Good job you finally got a w
---
Saturn's first stage was still 40% more powerful.
---
I mean I don't disagree.  But it's same as a faction Titan somewhat, after like your five or sixth titan do you really want number seven? Or even tho it's only one extra fitting slot and a bit more tank do u just get the faction Titan for the bling or 5 more Titans lol... Suppose it depends on the person.  I imagine (maybe because I want to see it lol) that we will see a Palantine in eve someday.
---
What is he saying besides about being stream sniped?
---
Don't underestimate all the idiots and wannabe diplomats out there, lol. We have seen many really just appalling diplomats and CEOs that shouldn't really hold such positions.
---
The time an investment off minerals would mean stoping production off mostly anything else. keep stars included, just to get all the mineral together.

Hell I hear said even goons couldn't do it alone. You probably would need all off goons tapi, and NC, pl (with what little industry they have)
---
An all the other northern entity's
---
I really don't get why any mission runners take the bait or why they're not d-scanning to get warning that someone's probing them down.
---
Anyone who warps into a mission and loots to go suspect will be in a PVP ship and not a PVE one, they wouldn't do it if there was any chance they'd lose the fight.
---
A shit fit Hyperion isn't beating a Machariel.
---
this is painful to watch, I'm just gonna pretend I never did. 
---
No, actually, who tf flies a propless blaster hyperion in with faction reppers and t1 hardeners RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It's more the massive jump in needs. Besides we don't have a keep in every system an every gate off delve yet.
---
If you and your corp are fairly active, they are incredibly rewarding places to both krab and fight.
---
It has absolutely *nothing* to do with 'advantage.' Don't believe me? Go check the prices on the character bazaar. My 125 million skill point character with perfect Gallente and Minmatar super carrier skills, and near flawless subcap skills is worth fuck all compared to what it was worth prior to injectors.
---
See the time invested to get the character to a particular point, or to fill a particular roll, used to have considerable economic value... and now a character is essentially worth a little more than the extract value because of the 'injected' skill books on that character--and when I mean slightly, I mean not at all unless the character has expensive capital ship skills (like Titan) injected.
---
The thing is that, with injectors, people can just bypass the investment of time and the value of precision, well planned, training, by just buying injectors and injecting a character to taste. Thus, *my* characters have been devalued.
---
A person via the character bazaar could *always* have negated the 'advantage' of another character's skill points with isk. Nothing has really changed there.
---
**Edit**
---
The above is why I, 'bitter vet,' feel like skill injectors have fucked me. From ***a game perspective*** the issue is the proliferation of certain ship types be they Rorqual, Supers, or Titans. From a certain point of view, given enough time, the proliferation of these ships would have happened anyway given enough time; however, injectors have accelerated this process considerably.
---
For example, given the two or so years it took to train a dedicated Titan pilot prior to the injectors, the number of Titan characters was going to be limited by that time investment. With skill injectors, you can inject into, and buy, a well fit Titan from zero with about $500 in plex. This means ***there are a lot more Titan players and Titans*** in game than there would have been otherwise.

tldr another highsec mission pubbie who knows nothing about the game or mechanics gets baited

UUA-F4 is my favorite place 
---
I'm fairly active - couple of hours a day when I'm keen. I do like hunting solo - what kind of ships would you recommend?  ONly WH ship I have set up is a dps Stratios - which tbh I have my doubts about.
---
delete this
---
You at probably right. It would take the work of multiple coalitions to pull off. I honestly wonder if that's what ccp intended. To build the most expensive citadel, the entirety of new Eden must work together and therefore it would become a monument to the dedication of new Eden. 
---
When I think about it like that, the Palatine keepstar could be one of the biggest monuments in eve if the group's work together. It could be the one structure no one wants to attack. And anchored by a corp or alliance that's made up of representatives of everyone who helped to build it. Instead of the tranquility trading towers anchored by test we should have the Palatine keepstar be the main player owned trade hub. 
---
That and our Kirins getting eviscerated.
---
It’s because we you promote the reporting of bots and create a pitchfork n’ torch crowd dedicated to disliking a common ‘thing’ it inevitably, and always, leads to doing more damage to the innocent vs. the actual guilty parties. 
---
I liked his module management. The way he managed to save countless GJ of cap by leaving his hardeners turned off is genious.
---
One problem. Every one would want to be on the first palantine keep kill still.
---
I don't know too much about flying a battleship but, maybe he forgot to activate 2 of his 3 reactive hardeners, or maybe am I wrong? 
---
Many a’ true word is said in jest.

oh, well
---
Set them for different timers. They don't have to be at the exact same time.
---
Just to make sure you know, Jury Rigging will have no effect on your ships at all, past needing Level III to unlock Launcher Rigging, so don't train it further.  
---
Other than that, you'll also want to train up the skill for the Spaceship Command skill for the ship you're flying. If you're flying a Kestrel, for instance, get Caldari Frigate to _at least_ IV, as each level buffs both the damage and velocity of your rockets on that ship.  
---
And, once you've got Rockets V, don't forget to train Rockets Specialization up if you plan on using Rocket Launcher II's.  
---
All the other skills we could suggest, other than the already mentioned Thermodynamics, are more for helping the ship around the Rockets get better, rather than affecting your damage at all. So that's Shields or Armor skills, capacitor-related Engineering skills, Navigation skills...
---
They only take about 10% of the damage before resistance due to the Lance having 5k sig, 
---
How the fuck is this guy a Twitch Affiliate much less get any viewers? Literally boring as shit and barely says anything.
---
Granted I don't understand the language, but I started at the timestamp provided and streamer pretty much didn't say a single word for the longest time.

Because they need to make room for the next version with similar effects to be given out in a future event. Just like the attribute boosters.

I pile Isk and things-I-might-sell later on a market alt and leave it to rot there.
---
It was, at 35 meganewtons from the first stage.

it's useless pve-wise atm. some people used to do abyssal pvp with it and it's decent , but it's pvp and abyss t3 sites are boring as f and i'm not sure it could manage t4 sites without too much pain in the ass
---
Poorly?

I make most of my isk from Ganking in highsec on alts... I then turn the spoils into ships for PVP. I think the only reason I have been able to amount any sort of space wealth is my lack of appetite for shiny ships. I run a small Corp in a small Alliance, and supply who I can with free ships when I can. Thankfully, frigates, a-frigs, cruiser are cheap.  
---
Although I do keep a log of my ganking, logging the amount dropped, destroyed, stolen (grrrr), etc. I NEVER log the amount I spend, and I really should start doing so.  
---
&gt; on the **first** palatine keep kill  
---
I think you'd mean the _only_ Palatine Keepstar kill. I doubt you'd be able to cobble together the efforts of the entire galaxy a second time, especially after almost every mineral was devoted to it for months, and the markets emptied of them.
---
scatter containers dont exist anymore. Back then you would hack a data site and all these little containers would shoot out and you had to loot them before they decayed
---
oh lame
---
hahahaha! love it.
---
If there was ever a post on reddit for this, it was this post.
---
Rats spawn in waves, so as you start killing them more appear. It also may have been that the site was only partly run and someone had already killed some of the rats before you got there.
---
I hate it. Manservant, destroy it post-haste! 
---
even easier cyno alts, nice
---
Those CCPearl Abyss metrics must be due soon...first the daily rewards, er I mean "free SP weekend", and now tripling the amount of SP your new skill farms, er, I mean, NEW PLAYERS get for buying another sub.
---
Ask the wife for the AMEX.
---
People staying in highsec, especially mission runners, typically don't understand any mechanic other than orbit-&gt;f1.
---
Even if the Hyperion wasn't shit fit, that Machariel would still shred it due to the fact the person flying the Hyperion isn't 1) paying attention and 2) doesn't know mechanics.
---
Relic and data site cans are still in the scatter containers group in the overview

" One Upwell hologram on some structures has been replaced with a less corporation specific image"
---
I wonder what image got replaced...
---
Thx for anser.
---
Thing is, every tome that i warp in, there is a crusier and a Battleship. I kill them and nothing more spanw. The site doest disapear from overview and, i takes a while for rats appear again (same crusier dame BS).
---
I'm a little confused and don't know what i'm missing. 
---
(The site is one with a big black structure in Middle, like a weird little astrashus, in ruins. There is a btoken part floating and a big rock. Can't shoot anything.)
---
Imagine if James315 had been the saviour of Eve and not of highsec and promoted VNI hunting instead of newbies in Retrievers.
---
OH look another post about "i want total lockout." forget that people bought a pos or a citadel i dont want them to be able to use it! If total lockout was actually a thing FW would become more scarce than it already is. 
---
And missions? a thousand good ideas have come and gone about those for the past 7 years. Just remove them. CCP likes to give up on stuff. This is the perfect thing to say fuck it with. Nobody likes them except the people who make mad $$$$.  If they want loyalty points for fw, let them run the fw plexs. simple as that.
---
And dual timers? this again? here is ccp's response. "timers are legacy code, cant do it"
---
Why? Is there a systemic hatred for mittens? 
---
You don't need to sub. It's the bonus SP the recruit gets which has no  requirement.
---
All of my friends with the same email address as me will be so excited!
---
you know more about flying battleships than this guy
---
If you’d like, I can see about getting you into a mining corp. you would have more fun mining if you talk to people on TS about random stuff. Lmk. 
---
omg! I almost choked on my food
---
Loki, Legion, Tengu, and Stratios are the best ships for Wormholes. If you like it and want to put up permanent residence, then you'll want to be able to fly all the T3Cs. If you don't have any trained, then go for the Loki. The Loki can be either shield or armor and is just the most versatile of the T3Cs.
---
The Stratios is a really good ship, especially if you're going into a fight where you feel like you might be getting baited. The neut pressure is great for ganking PVE ratters.
---
Also a Covert Ops of your choice. A lot of people fly Asteros for scanning but the CovOps are just better. The Helios is my favorite because it has the most mids. 
---
Other than that, Tengus and Gilas are good for PVE. I use 2 RR Domis to run C3 sites. Gas harvesting is **really** good isk if you can multibox and react it.

Well then you had a way better experience then me with them. I followed the route of getting into a decent faction warfare corp. When caldari was t5 the last time i farmed 20 million lp with lvl4 missions. Went into a nullsec alliance afterwards trained into carrier and bought me a nyx with the lp. Running with space violence as LA most of the time and start to go FC soon too 
---
True

Assault frigates and kikimoras, because everyone wants a killmark on their kikis.

---
can confirm hisec does have 'territory' you just dont have your logo in the top right.
---
can confirm anyone who thinks there are no merc corps that will place structures to continue their work is gravely mistaken.
---
This isnt especially fair tbh.  Longtime missionbears and miners have learned the hard way that they will be targetted.  MTU griefers, loot baiters, can flippers, CODE, shenanigans, etc.
---
Just last night i was practicing my rusty probing skills in caldari HS and noticed on a couple of occasions how quickly people reacted to the presence of my probe cluster by pulling expensive drones.  If they werent on the ball with dscan, theyd have never known.
---
Yeah I'm retarded. I know it was way easier to get than Partner status, but after looking at the Affiliate requirements it seems Twitch made it even easier than last I remember.
---
Who cares why they’re doing it if it gets new players into the game and maybe makes them want to keep playing.
---
I love how he looks the range of the guns and still decides to engage when Market Tycoon is almost double away from the falloff range of his guns. I was thinking that he would switch ammo type but noooo... 😂👌

I got to think of Frigates of Eve book that had pictures of strippers inside etc. so yeah, it is kind of fluid I guess...

I'm guessing the war target cannot be in 2 places at once either so your excuse doesn't hold.

honestly, if you want to meet people to learn from. dont rely on sites. rely on in game.
---
EVE-University, or the new brocorps BRAVE, KARMAfleet,and Horde.
---
And all of the people I might suggest the game to will get to experience these amazing bits of gameplay:
---
Cloaky camping
---
Blops/bomber gangs
---
Capital hot droppers
---
Nearly useless ECM
---
Soon to be nerfed carriers
---
Soon to be nerfed rorquals
---
Citadels that cannot defend themselves
---
Navigation structures which anyone can disable, anytime, just by shooting it for 10 minutes
---
And much much more
---
&gt;! Long story short, if you want to play eve and are not part of a massive alliance, the game is working against you. If you're not a pvp player, the game makes everything harder for you. 
---
Perhaps this is due to reddit being infested with those promoting/upvoting whatever makes the pvp players happy, perhaps this is due to issues with the CSM not properly representing the whole game, perhaps it's negligence, who can really say. 
---
All I know is this: Less and less people are logging in, which means less people for pvp players to shoot, which in turn will cause them to stay logged off until someone says they caught some newbie, log in, jump to cyno, kill him and log back off. !&lt;
---
2019 - and people still fall for being baited in missions! love it!  Why would anyone engage a Mach with a PVE fit!  Crazy.  Great to watch, made me chuckle :)

i wouldn't say you're stupid. i do the same things from time-to-time 'cause it's a video game. sometimes lose my stuff, sometimes luck out and make it.
---
this time ya didn't. hope you're staying playing so you can make it back and do it to someone else next!!!
---
I was getting jebaited the same way in an event site.. Its part of eve u learn stuff the hard way.. I just loled so hard because he complain about getting streamsniped even if only his salt was streamsniped xD
---
Yeah it's unfortunate to us in no so rich country's,  where I live the price went up about 60%, and 2 of my friends already unsubed, and a third one is in the verge of doing so. I personally won't unsub because it's still not too much for my wage, but it's higher than any game that have a subscription in my country, as everyone of them have their price adjusted for my country.
---
I hope CCP does not loose too much players due to this change. 
---
This is a great change for new players, but it's a bit sad that it's still tied to buddy invites. 
---
People who want to try EVE after randomly hearing about it may not know about this offer and end up creating their account without any invite. Then they learn about buddy invites and the 750k SP a few weeks later and they get sad about the missed bonus SP.
---
As I understand it, steam only does that to try to make prices more fair in places where they are locked, as a way to help curb piracy...  
---
Russia is one of steam's biggest markets, and prior to the price lowering in CIS region, was (and probably still is) THE place for pirated games.  
---

---
it's the last good place to play Eve 
---
People once thought titans were forever going to be rare sights on the battlefield as well due to "the massive expense" of building and skilling for them.
---
Sounds like old German 8mm pornfilm.
---
Honestly, even with full integration of the pilot and the ship, it never made much sense to me that a ship the size of a battlecruiser and up would not necessitate *some* crew. And when you start talking capital ships... no fucking way. :) 
---
Also, fighters need pilots... which would be easier to handwave as 'fighter drones' if the fighter models did not have cockpits. 
---
*Skadoosh*
---
Honestly, this is a good change imo. Let's be real: most of the new accounts will be vets anyway, but for those who're not it will ease the pain of having a 6 months skill queue just to train the infamous magic 14. That of course applies to vets as well, who will then spend less time logging in their alpha toons to update training, which is something I utterly despise.  Also, this translates to exactly 0 effect on active subs and maybe some more newbie retention, which again is a good thing.

Like I said under my comment... when you start talking about ships the size of Battlecruisers and up, and given that we know from the lore that non-capsuleer ships have significant crews, I do not really think you can *deus ex machina* "bots!" 
---
Just an easy example is carrier fighters. Sure you could try to say these are "fighter drones;" however, the models *have cockpits.*

Haha! We try to form up roams up to your space every now and then. I was in a frigate fleet a couple weeks ago where we just got absolutely wiped by your Stabbers. Was fun as hell! I got a few before my Enyo went up in glorious flames.
---
Assault frigates got revamped about a year ago to actually be good. With the state of eve right now, if you're roaming around you gotta be highly mobile to avoid getting fukt by caps everywhere. As the strongest frigate-sized ships in the game assault frigs are a natural choice for this. You still see nano cruisers a lot too, don't get me wrong, and they still have advantages over AFs in areas like projection, but AFs are undeniably very popular for sure.
---
Actually, its hunters like this that help those inexperienced, new explorers learn to be safer, which in turn allows them to enjoy EVE that much more... :)
---
Hijacking top comment because I'm a Karma whore.

---
I think they boost diplomacy with NPC factions, i.e. when running missions you are rewarded with more positive standings.
---
Rebrand the WMDs as "long range kinetic terraforming devices" to get around ITAR restrictions and back into the public markers.
---
Exactly hahaha, had a similar experience earlier in my cynabal, got blown up but I sure as hell took down 3 of them with me, even though their ships were cheaper but I had fun.
---
The retribution is popular because it has the best combination of projection and dps among the AFs (beam fit, of course). Only the harpy outranges it, but with much, much lower dps. This makes it the best AF for skirmishing and applying dps at medium ranges, which is pretty much the exact description of what a small roaming fleet needs to be able to do.
---
Harpies are more popular in larger fleets where their lower DPS can add up and the longer range is more important, while the retribution is a stronger choice than the harpy in lower number situations where you've got more room to get closer and you need more dps out of each ship.
---
Not hard to kill them in an Atron. I need to try doing that again. 
---
Agreed. They should tie it to joining a corporation instead. People who join corps and get a social circle are surely more likely to stay. The game should give a nudge in that direction.
---
&gt; is there anywhere left for small corps that wanna PVP? or are the only choices now test,horde or pirat etc? 
---
Honestly only some parts of LS and even that will come under fire. WHs are too anally retentive with idiotic amount of scanning necessary to do anything to the point where you'll get carpal syndrome and multiple accounts required from any practical point of view both of which completely ruin any fun and a lot of functionality of a small entity. 
---
In contrast, in LS you can actually function on single or double account just fine, only problem is that there isn't much of it left that is not dominated by larger groups already. And on the flip side of that, because it is LS you can simply wait out any large group rolling through while doing something else if push comes to shove. 
---
You can still do some FW but will have to leave when caps show up which sucks major ass.
---
Other then that, you can wardec other small corps in HS, don't do it like the old groups used to by "blanket" wardecs etc. but pick carefully, check out your targets killboards, check their alliance etc. check their structures, everything. Then wardec. Be very selective about it. HS is unfortunately the last remaining place in the game where you can still find small independent corps with somewhat experienced players who play on single or double accounts can still be found thriving. A word though, they have many experienced players, just because you see a character in such a corp that is a couple years old and has little KB does not mean it is actually a total carebear. It can be very experienced player who just simply wants to chill on their alt, remember this, though of course, there are a lot of carebears too. So this all goes back to being very selective about your targets.
---
&gt;but I would be interested in where you see a small pvp corp could fit in low/nullsec.
---
We do fine as a 7 man corp in lowsec.  [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98592854/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98592854/) 
---
Only one corporation per faction will effect that empire's standing as well. All other corps in that empire only effect their individual standing. I read this a long time ago so don't remember which corps are the magical ones.
---
I have no idea what this is about, and I'm hoping it's a mistake that gets resolved. I haven't been given any information about it.

Why even have a csm at this point?

EVE is all of that and more! I love the depth, complexity, freedom to truly play as you want to play it and have fun your way... from exploration to EWAR to Logi to hero tackle and eve belt ratting for npc hauler spawns or Dreads!

If you wanna run incursions the least training time intensive ships will be battleships. 
---
Which battle ship you train for will depend on who you want to fly with. 
---
For a new player one of the few incursion groups I’ve found that is actually active is Warp To Me Incursions. You can talk to them in game  in the channel “Warp to Me Incursions”. (I’m typing from memory so the channel name might not be right.) 
---
You’ll also wanna check out their website at forums.warptome.net/topic/301-rookie-guide
---
They have several ship fits for alpha and omega accounts and you can use that to start making money. 
---
Also if you need it I have my old Hyperion I used when I first started incursions and I can throw some money your way as well. 
---
It's a fun little number, and I'm glad you posted it. I'm more interested in the shit talking, was it provoked, or is he just toxic?

So, to be clear, you're finding out about this through the linked page on CCP's website? CCP didn't contact you directly to notify you prior to posting about your removal on their website? Regardless of what you may or may not have done, thats a pretty fucked up thing to do on CCP's part. CCP should have at least given you a heads up.

Giving an honest answer,

it's not a small or easy feat to get 200 people in fleet to smash a hi-sec structure.  You need to use your size to your advantage.    Be mobile be, adapt faster and with punish the big boys for every mistake.

Can we stay away from RL politics. This comment chain can go down a sinkhole really quickly. I gotta say, a permaban is new, IIRC someone was removed from the CSM last term and didn't eat one.
---
I mean they work and have a purpose. The problem is just that one of the others can probably fullfil it better.
---
Since both summits are already done and the election isn't far away, I'd guess not. Honestly have no idea.

Why are you NOT on the CSM :(

At least wormholers can complain about something, even though it was an unchecked exploit, and complain hard enough to get a mod &gt;!The mass entangler!&lt; so you can keep easily removing wormholes. Everyone else? Better have an alliance member on the CSM. Preferably 3+

A planet where corporations should notify those affected before issuing a press release about it? If there was a concern that he would hide assets, extract toons, etc. then just ban him first, then notify him, then issue the press release. 
---
doesn't need Brisc for that tbh ...
---
Wow... really Brisc?
---
CCP we need an AAR on this 
---
I'm curious who the other two are. If it's any combo of their big 3 FCs (Pando, Shines, Bliss) that's no bueno for Init.

I was trying to figure out why when you undock a slow ship e.g. a carrier, it seems to be faster to stop the ship (to e.g. 30-40% of Vmax), and then pulse your mwd and hit warp vs just hitting warp.
---
Btw, I found [this](http://eveismath.blogspot.com/2015/09/part-i-introduction-to-objects-and-eves.html) yesterday, goes into detail for some of the mechanics regarding acceleration.

Weren't they removed for something dumb like literally not showing up to meetings?

noobman or whoever it was ate a perma for leaking info didn't he?

Are CSMs CCP employees or something?

Clearly what we need is a player elected body to hold accountable those on the other player elected body.

They don't tell botters and rmters the reason for bans and for good reasons. Why should the csm get different treatment?

Your biggest market determines the economics for all. It sucks for turkey, but on the other hand, people would literally be trying to buy Turkey Game codes to save 80% on their subs if it continued.

---
Most of the CSM guys take their roles very seriously.
---
Yeah, no shit. It's one thing for a 19 year old college student (example picked completely out of ass) to go "eh fuck it" and leak, but this guy tied his real life identity to this shit, and he's in a business where he needs to engender the trust of others. This was not particularly smart.

Please Brisc, make it glorious

Bring them all down with you, I'm sure you're not the only one!

So you broke an NDA to insider trade in a video game. I'm sure your real work as a lobbyist *in the state I live in* is on the up and up. Get fucked, truly, then move somewhere else.

If they contacted him prior to taking any action then he and whoever he was "in" with would have moved and dispersed any and all assets and SP stripped any and all applicable toons. So they had to do it without warning.

I am sorry to hear that, it is very surprising to me as I had the feeling you were a straight guy and you did put a lot of work into the CSM.   At best you were foolish and let out some information like many CSM had and you got screwed by people passing it on and using it.   That CCP did not speak to you about it is rather odd and is ringing all sorts of alarm bells.
---
Anyway I wish you all the best and thanks for all the work you put into the war decs for example.

Well for sure he will sue CCP if he will be not able to clarify all the stuff using normal CCP channels.

Fucking politicians eh...I guess it is true what they say about them! Classic

one example is the old "pump and dump" 
---
1) Buy up a lot of a low-value item
---
2) Pump the price by starting a rumor that said low-value item will soon be increasing in price due to coming changes or use high-pressure sales tactics to get other people to buy in.
---
3) Dump said item into the hype at a much higher price than what you bought them for and profit.   
---
If you saw the movie Wolf of Wallstreet this is the tactic that he used that got him sent to prison.

EVE is such a polarizing game that I HIGHLY doubt a bit of extra SP is going to be the difference between a new player staying or not, when they seem to refuse to fix the main things keep new players away (HINT:  Like the shitfucktastic default overview that has been an issue since forever)

Sounds like you found a DED site.   Plenty of info on them including on what you need to be able to tank to finish it. Being that it's in HS, they should be totally doable for you and very rewarding.   
---
As for "debuffs" they are displayed as little symbols above your health.   You can mouse over them and they'll say what they are.   You were either warp disrupted (can't warp) or warp scrambled (can't warp or use a microwarp drive).   
---
Another tip is you can control click on the symbol and it will target whatever is doing it to you. Then kill that ship and free yourself.  
---
https://youtu.be/QUg7O7dXuQs

1. A deadspace combat site. Check the Eve Uni [page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites) for more info.
---
2. There are modules that disable a ship from warping. CCP has some [info](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004925705-Warp-Scrambling-and-Warp-Disruption). Nowadays you should see an icon above your HUD, indicating you're being disrupted / scrammed. You can also hover over it to see who's scramming you. It's also visible on your overview.
---
3. Again, check the Eve University [page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Deadspace). There are places in EvE called deadspace, which cannot be reached by normal warping. They're 'protected' by gates. You usually find these in missions and combat sites you probe down.

Buy PLEX on a downswing. Can't go wrong with it. Do not hold on to currency or assets as much as possible, keep it all in form of PLEX. The downside is that when you want to make a larger purchase of anything you can't do it immediately, have to sell off a bit 1st then buy whatever it is you wanna buy. But you can still find a sort of "comfort zone" and retain a minimum "operating budget" while keeping the rest in PLEX.

Debuffs/buffs from other ships/structures are shown above your capacitor/health bars. You can mouse over them to read them and which ship/structure is applying it. 
---
Here are some sample effects and what they do:
---
Stasis Webified: Reduced movement speed
---
Warp Disrupted: Can't warp
---
Warp Scrambled: Can't warp and can't use a microwarpdrive
---
Target Painted: Your signature radius is increased making it easier to hit you
---
The easiest way to get rid of these effects is to kill the ship/structure applying them to you. But as you saw if you get out of range of the effect you can also break it.

What the CSM is or isn't doesn't matter. CCP are professionals in a corporate environment and should behave accordingly when issuing press releases regarding specific individuals. Its not like they don't have a direct line of communication to him. If the allegations are true (and they probably are) then Brisc is a piece of shit. That doesn't mean CCP should act shitty back to him in response. Part of being professional is acting professional.
---
So assmuing the thing you supposedly leaked is already in the game, can you tell us what you are being accused of leaking?
---
Terrible English skills, I know
---
Possible, but would be a harsh sell. They only ever used his in-game name (as opposed to his real one), &amp; the punishment was for his own actions while in a very public position that he chose to enter, so a public announcement is not out of the ordinary.
---
If he does try to sue for IRL defamation, he's going to have a VERY hard time, as his "doxxing" was all done by him and his friends - the alleged harm is entirely self-inflicted.
---
I would imagine ccp is running this promotion based on data that is telling them that new players want to experience more ships earlier in order to keep playing. And if this decision *isn’t* based on such data, then well, :ccp:

---
&gt; Dear Citizens of New Eden, 
---
It is with great disappointment that I bring you the following news. Brisc Rubal has been found to be sharing confidential information with a member of his alliance that was later used by another alliance member to conduct illicit in-game transactions. As a result, the following actions have been taken: 
---
Brisc Rubal has been removed from his role as a CSM 13 representative effective immediately and will not be able to run in any future CSM elections.
---
All his in-game accounts have been permanently banned from the game.
---
Two other players involved in this incident have received a one-year ban.
---
All the illicit assets and ISK gained from this incident have been confiscated. 
---
To be fully transparent, this misconduct was brought to us by the CSM themselves as an immediate threat to the integrity of the CSM as an institution. CCP’s stance on this is clear: regardless of the type of information shared, acts like this go against everything that the Council of Stellar Management stands for and will not be tolerated under any circumstances. 
---
The CSM is built on trust and we expect a high level of confidentiality from each member at all times. This requirement is imperative for a few reasons. Firstly, to ensure uninterrupted, close collaboration as we work together on setting up EVE Online for the best possible future. Secondly, to not have our players worry that information shared with the CSM is misappropriated and that the non-disclosure agreement is respected. Lastly, to provide all council members with a safe environment where they can freely discuss all the game-related matters without the risk of details being passed on outside the closed circle. 
---
It is further extremely disheartening that a very productive and respected member of the council committed this infraction. However, we won’t let this hinder the great impact that the CSM had on New Eden, CCP and the community and are determined to continue improving the CSM in the future. 
---
We would like to take the opportunity to thank CSM 13 for their transparency and their respect for the council as an institution, which was demonstrated by their coming together to condemn this kind of behavior and report it to CCP. 
---
Some additional steps to help prevent similar conduct in future will be implemented. Starting from the next summit, we will impose a rule that prohibits electronics during CSM sessions and will take extra time to educate everyone about confidentiality, insider trading and general do’s and don’ts when it comes to operating under NDA. 
---
The CSM 14 elections are approaching fast! Please keep an eye on the community website for a dev blog that will explain all the nitty gritty details next week.
---
publicly breaking? May i ask what you mean by that?
---
&gt; Also get rid of the CSM 
---
and then how do we get to ban people like brisc :(

You sure it's not a WITCH HUNT, an obvious HOAX by 12 angry Icelanders? 
---
1: I don't recognize the exact combat site you're describing, but higher level encounters will often have impressive-looking setpieces like that at the end. Generally speaking the station or whatever just serves as an impressive backdrop for the fight.
---
2: If you were unable to warp, it's because you were being warp disrupted or warp scrambled by one of the NPCs. Effects like this are visible by an icon directly above your HP/capacitor display - if you hover over the icon it'll tell you what type of effect is being placed on your ship and who is responsible.
---
3: Some locations in space are what is known as 'deadspace', this includes any site with an acceleration gate as well as a few others. Deadspace just has a property that attempting to warp to anyplace inside of it will *always* warp you to the outside of the first gate instead. For pve purposes this ensures you can't bypass parts of the site, and it also has various tactical consequences in pvp.
---
Also, just a tip - if you want to fly in a particular direction, you don't need to find an object to align to in that direction, you can just double-click in space and your ship will start flying that way. The way you described your escape seemed to suggest that you pulled away from the station by aligning to an object, so I just wanted to let you know that there's an easier way.

N+1 Falcon' s, took my corp on a roam to blap them, we got their blingy Bhaal and nearly their Widow then a seemingly endless number of Falcon s just jam everyone and they bail. 
---
They would be fun if not for that, but not been there since the ECM changes. 
---
There is a lot actually. Start with Jita local chat, ISK doublers, false contracts, various scams, etc. Then move down the contracts for things such as false hauling contracts, again more scams, more fraud.
---
Then check the large stuff and look at the RL anti trust and anti-competition laws and regulations and start by looking at MERs and compare.
---
Then move on to price fixing, various types of market fraud etc. as pointed out elsewhere in the thread.
---
So all together actually quite a lot.

Brisc isn't even an FC you fuckin dope, just some nobody who rode the goon ticket onto the CSM.

---
Why wasn't he banned from eve forums tho?
---
To join the CSM you have to sign an NDA that you won't leak things, you're legally bound to follow it and brisc hasnt, which means he has publicly broke the NDA.
---
Well this aged well

Well, a large enough AF gang can kill an unsupported carrier (I've done it), but that's generally not the main consideration as a single unsupported carrier isn't common (barring a ratter too stupid to fit/light a cyno) and this ability isn't unique to AFs. It's more just that AFs are highly mobile which makes escaping from your typical overwhelming-but-clumsily-applied capital ship response fleet much easier.

Did they finally catch on?

Fuck snitches. This is bullshit.  
---
What did he mean by this? :thonk:
---
loil
---
His 61 lawyers you mean? I really doubt he is going to get anywhere sueing CCP for banning him without cause.
---
he was a condescending, arrogant asshole to everyone, all the time. It's actually impressive how widespread dislike of him is 
---
&gt; vote for him in the first place.
---
They just have to send out pings telling the monkeys who to vote for lmao
---
what about noobman
---
lmao
---
I've straight up been afk for 6 months, think one of the last fleets I was on was killing Brisc's titan, and I could've sworn he was relatively well regarded at the time. What's he done that's made so many people hate him if I may ask?
---
/r/whoosh material at this point, really.
---
Maybe they did. Maybe its on his game account associated e-mails and he just hasn't had a chance to log in and check them yet. We do not know. Or maybe they didn't. Until he himself sorts everything out, looks at any applicable timestamps etc. talks to people, see what all happened, see ho all got banned etc. and then lets all of us know what it all was, we may or may not know.
---
Need all the facts first.
---
Goons getting lanced like the boil that they are.

Wait, I'm a Goon

that's brisc, baby!

Normally, not so much, but, in this case: Yup, rule-breaking deserves punishment. Fuck init.
---
INIT spent a year seeding leaking alts for this.
---
TAPI will downvote me so hard, but I must say it. I love it 10/10
---
Pod yourself retard
---
Are you gonna suck up init corps now to merge into snigg?
---
ok so that explains the dislike.  but what did he leak o.0
---
did he tell his alliance to mass sell claws before the change was announced or something?
---
To the surprise of literally nobody, it turns out CCP takes a harder stance on corruption than governments do
---
I assumed he'd be experienced enough to not get caught, but what do I know?

I was honestly expecting shocked pikachu 
---
This operation started over a year ago
---
being both an rl politician and a spaceship politician is not a good thing for your image
---
High sec sites you can do in a frig that scram? Is that really true? My guess is that he wasn’t just bumping off the structure which would explain being able to warp when he changed directions. 
---

He was always a shit csm and a shit person. This is good for the eve community.

Wololol, apply in game, wolololol

I don't vote for politicians. It just encourages them.
---
What's a bar review board going to think about a broken NDA I wonder.
---
Can we get a synopsis on what happened?
---
&gt;this misconduct was brought to us by the CSM themselves as an immediate threat to the **integrity of the CSM** as an institution.
---
Didnt know it was a thing. Dont think they need to worry about that.
---
So the CSM is just another level of the metagame.
---
says the guy who was advertising ''WTS African N-Word Passes'' for eve online 17 days ago on reddit lol

/u/CCP_Falcon You lost the very few respect I had for you. You knew this was happening and it was not a coincidence, but instead of stepping up and acting, you made me look like a fool. Shame on you.

I'm going to assume you're busy because you're working. If so, save the mind-numbing grinding and just buy a PLEX pack which will give you \~1.8 billion ISK for about $15 (assuming minimum wage, 900 mil an hour).

Then go do something actually fun like shooting people.
---
You made yourself look like a fool by throwing accusations without evidence.
---
You didn't know this csm was leaking, you mere guessed right.
---
&gt; Fuck snitches
---
Tell us more about how you hate snitches. Also, tell us more about you breaking your CSM NDA. This definitely aged well.
---
Yeeted swordlessBunny's hands
---
You're right that this is about professionalism rather than the specifics of what the CSM is/isn't.
---
I disagree that CCP handled it poorly. I don't think it's unprofessional to announce that you've shitcanned somebody for (so egregiously) violating the rules without privately informing them beforehand. I don't know why shitcannees deserve such consideration.

joking about snitches the day before everyone knows you leak csm info :smart:
---
He was #7 on our ballot and our votes only trickled down to #4, so even if we didn't have lockstep voting supremacy, he still would have been elected. It was mostly pubbies like you voting for a meme that got him on.
---
If you ignore that the CSM is leaking since years, you either are a fool, or don't want to know it. 
---
launch a investigation with the community team lol.. who will then contact csm about this issue. Brisc wasn't part of the boys club and they found a way to get rid of him lol..
---
Wait you guys are getting paid? 
---
Was he anti-goon?
---
Lol fuck off with these lies
---
We've all seen the pay of CCP devs... the box ain't that big. 
---
I'd hate to throw out random things like "has said so much dumb shit" without actually linking the dumb shit. This is the PERFECT PLACE to display things like that. Let's have it!
---
ofc, Illuminati and shit. Nothing to see with the fact that INIT moved to Fountain and kicked their renters a month before the April balance patch amiright ?
---
&gt;Buhbye, fuckslap.

Bahaha. Love it!

Poorly

Brisc doesnt give a shit.  Its a goon csm who reported it to ccp top
---
&gt;Um I think the haters of The Imperium are currently vote brigading this thread
---
Even if they were, its still Eve news, and big news at that.
---
I never said it doesn't. I just pointed out why you targeting falcon is ridiculous.
---
AFAIK yes, along with a few other non-CSM people with him
---
CSM is a fucking joke anyway so no harm no foul lmao

Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.

How did you get that generous donation? ;)

---
Why can't I gild this from my app 
---
Hot Take: Unless this is significantly worse than I imagine it is, that permaban isn't deserved. It's funny to talk about, and all, but I feel like a 2-3 year ban (or an "indefinite" ban) would have been a more fitting punishment.
---
Yeah but hear me out, how many of your co workers do you hate?
---
Yeah, thats a point in favor of the tinfoil theory. 
---
Hm got a fit for that? I just returned so I'm completely out of the loop
---
WAIT. I don't see it, and it's disappointing coming from this community that I don't see it.   
---
So I'll say it. 
---
That's Brisc, baby.
---
A politician using his position for personal gain?  SAY IT AINT SO!
---
Pubbies like me huh? Literally never voted in CSM, keep showing the world how retarded you are querns, lol.
---
republican party, as far as I know
---
Oh shit is this true? Bad if true :(
---
I mean, you are right about the fact that I had no proof. But since when does that stop people from believing what is obvious, specially on this sub ? In the end I was right, and I will never believe that back then, Falcon wasn't aware of didn't have suspicions. It's either foolishness, or incompetence. 
---
according to Falcon you need proof lol... Brisc saw something he wasn't supposed to see or hear and they found a way. 
---
Yeah I think the Osprey Navy and the Caracal Navy should swap bonuses, or add missile velocity to the Caracal Navy and call it a day. There's probably better tweaks, but this is would super simple and wouldn't change much 
---
What did he do? He was probably the most vocal about the botting issue.
---
Breaking a real life contract to win at a internet spaceships. What a rube. 
---
Who were the other 2?

You forgot the part where anom nerfs were public knowledge. Nice try for some attention though, I guess I just helped you win on that front.

anyone who actually believed any of this is a massive idiot

---
Although I haven't even logged in to Eve or had primary source access even if I did in ages, so don't take anything I ever say as anything but rumors at best.
---
There is a legal angle regarding PLEX that is unresolved, and which potentially could be basis for a case, there is at least one incident regarding that, which resulted in reinstatement, and lawsuit for payback of monetary value equal to the PLEX on the accounts was dropped.

All the other stuff you're right about though.

---
Also imagine if it comes out that it was a mistake after all. CCP would be soooo fucked.

To elaborate (directed at OP); The drone damage bonus is tied to the hull, so you don't have to spend 2 months maxing out a battleship skill to get full DPS from drones. However if you boost up your missile skills a bit you can add some complimentary damage from Cruise or Rapid heavy missiles.
---
I'm not sure what the numbers are like regarding bling fits, but it's *fairly* easy to hit 1,000+ dps with just t2 fittings... which would cost around 500m, give or take.

He was elected to a position of power and betrayed the trust of the playerbase of eve.  Nothing less than a permaban on all of his accounts is adequate.  They did the right thing. Fuck people that take advantage of their situation like that, in game and irl.

Yeah, you do realize that the CSM is not one person but a group, and that they have zero control over the decisions made at CCP. Pitching an idea on the CSM is about 2 steps above drunkenly rambling your grand innovation of killmarks for NPCs to whichever poor dev is stuck next to your dumb ass on the pub crawl.

This. As a weary patriot we are innocent until proven guilty here in this country. But Brisc is already guilty as fuck for his day job so I'd bet money he's guilty of this too
---
Should be easy to spot the people who profited from the leaks, they’ll be on here defending him furiously in case they get some blow back
---
Well, he deserves to get sued IRL for that one. In game, I don't really care, I'm just generally opposed to permabans as a concept. An "indefinite ban" leaves you with possibilities that a permaban doesn't, and I prefer to leave myself with possibilities for the future when I can.
---
Of course, and indefinite ban could easily be permanent, but I prefer the term indefinite. Really, it's just annoying pedantry on my part, but it mostly stems from my feelings on the CSGO ban of the IBUYPOWER players.
---
Yeah. It’s sad because SJWism destroys communities and I see it ramping up in EVE (I will NEVER say “krabbing”, it’s “jewing”, fuckyoubanme) these past few years. Really started with the Erotica 1 witch hunt.

I would take having a CSM who could leak but self regulate over not having a CSM any day

For the record - and I assume this will get removed - but I do not know what the charges are against me, and I deny that I leaked any information that could have been monetized in game to any members of my alliance.
---
I believe this is a mistake, and I hope that I’ll have an opportunity to clear my name.
---
Wonder what happened? Can we be specific, CCP?
---
kinda.
---
so instead of 5 drones. you only launch 2 heavies.  but these heavies got ALOT more hp and dmg.  so they about on par with 5 heavies. and are far more durable.
---
couple this with the missiles for more dmg.
---
and if you want to be a super ratter.   replace hte heavies with 1 gecko.
---
the gecko, is on part with 2 heavies. and with rattle bonuses. is 5 heavies in one.
---
but, its faster, does omni dmg,  and has the tracking of a medium drone. so it hits alot better.
---
and sentry drones also get the buff.
---
the downside,  is this epci dmg and hp buff.  does not apply to light or medium drones.  but thats it.

It would help if you could tell me the name of the site, but an overview of combat sites and anomalies can be found [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites). If the sties you are trying to run is not found there then is is neither an anomaly or a cosmic signature, and is instead some kind of monument, or other semi-unique celestial. These are usually related to either COSMOS missions or epic arcs, though some exist independently of any larger mission. Unless you have a specific reason to run one of these such as a COSMOS mission, they are generally best ignored. The other possibility is that the rouge drone site you are seeing in the youtube videos is the site from a previous event. If it is the site depicted [here](https://eveonlineiskguide.com/rogue-drone-sites/) then that is the case, you won't find these in space anymore as they were part of an event that happened several months ago and has since ended..
---
Not every Reddit user is a US citizen nor obsessed with US politics. I'd prefer r/Eve to not turn into a politically charged mess.
---
yeah.....honestly i sitll say they should nerf VNI's drone bandwith to 100.
---
Vexor has 75
---
VNI would ahve 100
---
Ishtar would have 125
---
and Myrm would not be as big a joke, as it would have the same bandwidth as VNI. 
---
but i'm probably missing some balance factor
---
yeah i dunno, blocking someone isn't toxic, all the stuff before that is the stuff to scrutinize. I don't speak German so I can't verify it, the only thing I caught is he said stream sniping. That's my only lead to support your claim, sincethat tells me he doesn't feel responsible for his actions

No, it doesn't. It only requires them to confirm your real-life identity.
---
Think about your childhood memories where everyone is happy and it’s sentimental. Everything in this image should fill you with love and reminiscence.
---
Now imagine that everyone is dead with a gun wound in them.  Imagine that it doesn’t matter to you now. That’s pretty normal in the world. You could be alone hanging out with everyone that’s in your kin but then an explosion suddenly happens. 
---
Would you have survivor’s guilt if you were the only one alive? Would you take a bullet for someone? Honestly? Do you love someone that much? How much do you love someone? How much do you take for granted?
---
Think of a large classroom full of children. Many best friends and people there who are brothers &amp; sisters to eachother. Eventually everyone moves on. People do drugs, become prostitutes, drop out of school, commit suicide, or resort to alcohol. Nobody would care about one another. The innocent person in this situation feels like everyone leaves him. He grows up thinking that’s what’s always going to happen. 
---
Truth is, he’s right. 
---
When was the last time you talked to an old childhood friend? Did he or she get physically or sexually abused every day and you didn’t know it? Would they care to talk to you after so long? Would they even be alive?
---
What do you think about family? Family doesn’t matter in the long run. People are just people and everyone is just an object with chemicals rushing through them causing them to think and feel pain.
---
You have no fucking clue what is going on in the world. You think you’re fine right now and nothing bad can happen to you. Tomorrow you wake up and have to evacuate your town because of a wildfire. You have no idea.
---
Diseases, natural disasters, rape, murder, and terrorism could happen to you in an instant and you wouldn’t expect it, because your life is too innocent.
---
We all love our families but when someone dies we tend to blame ourselves. We aren’t at fault. We’re just too innocent and don’t expect anything bad to happen. Everyone leaves in the end and theirs nothing we can do to fix it.
---
Hopefully it doesn’t sound edgy. I’m talking from experience.
---
My mom left me 3 years ago and we can finally see eachother in the next week. People have left me all along. I’m drifting away from my friends. We all had so much sentimental memories but one day everyone stopped caring for eachother. Everyone hates eachother and is having sex, getting pregnant in High School, doing drugs, and committing suicide.
---
What do I do to still fit in? Do I take extremes? No.. My parents were overprotective when I was younger and I was an only child. To me, all my friends going away is like losing a giant part of myself. That’s how life works though and the internet and my school have one thing in common. They both have taught me that life is shitty and the real world doesn’t care about sentimental moments in people’s lives. You grow up and live for the systems, get money and start your own life if you’re motivated enough. Where’s my motivation? I’d get called a pussy if I didn’t live to serve my job and slave around all day doing work. That’s just how the ‘real world’ is and I just have to grow up and live it. I’ll probably end up working at a minimum wage job because I don’t have motivation to do anything else.
---
I’m sorry for the truth, but that’s just how I feel. Life is like one thing after the other and family just isn’t as important anymore.
---
i put more effort into reporting this post for being low effort than you did making it
---

Yes, they jailed all criminal investment bankers, compensated the victims, and after that inaugurated a new Constitution that was basically written by and voted for by all the people of Iceland. When it became public that their at that time Prime Minister had profited from the worlds economic crisis with offshore company in Paname, they made him leave and elected someone from the people (the guy that refused to sit with other politicians during EuroCup 2016 but was standing inside the roots fans.

Timing and idea are great but the execution needs work

Hmm, TIL. Thanks.
---
Never forget that everyone with any sort of wormhole tag or dislike for Init is in HK.

I mean, CCP doesn't need the general populace / etc. to agree or approve with their actions.

Yeah... That line honestly only makes it look worse.

Probably not till the information that was leaked is no longer relevant. 
---
Could have been a leak about an upcoming, unannounced feature or something like an exploit that hasn't been fixed yet.

Why are you holding me accountable to promises I did not make, even if they were never gonna fulfilled as the csm has no power?

Brisc stood for election as a Republican in some random election in 2011 so I'd wager it's at least slightly relevant in relation to this
---
i hope you dont mean Texas law

Also on his twitter account. https://twitter.com/BrianSchoeneman

I feel like Brisc will be saying that soon

&lt;3
---
Hmm so that is why I got info that one FC from Goon friends ally is going for a year off from Eve... Now I know why...
---
Apparently he was online when banned. A little silly for CCP to announce this, then enact bans later. Should have been the other way around.

Let’s be serious, we know he’s gonna make another account and get a juicy plex pool waiting for him when he comes back.
---
Your original post says Bastion moved not INIT moved. Also I'm fairly certain that Initiative has lived in fountain with Thier renters for like two years or more.
---
From what I have seen in the CSM minutes, the goon guys tend to be super serious about issues and dealing with them on the CSM.
---
It doesn't surprise me in the slightest that his fellow goons tossed him under the bus.
---
No comment.
---
All wormholer tagged people are strong members of hk thats how hk can form 300 people
---
Apparently it was the other goons who reported him.
---
This too. Could be a ruse but who knows.

Ancientlexy:  for those of you who have or haven't heard, Today CCP banned Brisc,Shines and Pando from the game. Please DO NOT LOSE YOUR HEADS. It is business as always.

what did he do to get a life time ban???
---
&gt;o be clear, you're only finding out about this through the linked page on CCP's website? CCP didn't contact yo
---
I don't know this dude, and frankly ignore the CSM; however, I am seeing a common theme here. CCP seems to have a thing for permabanning people without telling them why. 
---
I wait with baited breath to see if he gets an actual response to a ticket, or if they just close it.
---
No way that will happen. We saw how vigilant goons fought this last time. That would be unthinkable...
---
LOCK HIM UP!!
---
ye I'll admit it's looking more like it now, that's fair
---
oh well, what a clusterfuck
---
Hm, dunno tbh, don't remember ever running sites in high sec :P But yes there's also a very good chance that  he couldn't warp due to bumping to the structure.

OP did you actually enter warp (i.e. "Warp speed active" notification etc) but you couldn't get your speed up?

Its confirmed by INIT that its Pando and Dark Shines.

So let me get this straight, you didn't do anything wrong, despite the fact that CCP has clearly stated otherwise?
---
Well, I'm not sure why I should be surprised from shit coming out of a Lobbyist mouth.
---
Doomchinchilla has implied that it is Sister Bliss. We MUST have CCP clarify on this matter post-haste
---
Yeah, y'all are great! &lt;3

As an aside, can someone tell me who at CCP decided it would be a good idea for there to be 2 GE- systems in Catch? Thank goodness only one is owned by Brave, or I'd forget which one is your staging lmao.

Ugh. So I don't know much about what this guy actually did and never really knew anything about him besides that he is a massive shitstain to people on the forums, but any use of the "Make/Again"  false-nostalgia structure in any kind of proposal, especially coming from a US Republican politician, simultaneously makes me roll my eyes, but also be a little sick.

He's a lawyer I believe and had no qualms with throwing around his real name and identity during the election. I'm not a lawyer but presumably by trying to make a bit more iskies for his corpies he's now opened himself up to this being brought up by opposing counsel in court, or at the very least it's on public record that he broke an NDA.
---
kinda dumb tbh

He's going to do the typical lawyer lobbyist thing and clench up of course.

the statement sounds like market abuse over the NDA knowledge of some patched items (maybe HAW-Guns, maybe Faction weapons, who knows?)
---
Got em
---
Nah, the guys on the CSM are all high ranking goons.  I guarantee you, if it was a goon, they talked to the leadership before they did this.  You will get a story on INN about how goons saved the CSM from a corrupt goon.

There are different levels of anxiety, and this seems to be a very minor case of it.  If you can actually start the conversations, you're already miles ahead of me.  I genuinely wish it was that easy for me.

Ok, including the Shines RL bit is a new all time low.

While there are mistakes being made, I doubt this is one of them. CCP knows very well how high profile this is and I'm sure they would give it some very serious thought and be careful with it. Also, they have no obligation to share their evidence with us, or with him. Especially if there is a possibility of potential further harm to the game by doing so.
---
That would require having the ability to talk to strangers I don't know.  I don't know how else to say it at this point, I'm too scared to talk with people.  I'm not saying I'm anxious to sound quirky, I'm honestly afraid to start conversations like that.  So going on TS and talking about random stuff with people I don't know?  Wouldn't work out.
---
REEEEEEE
---
The minute you start telling people not to panic, people start panicking because they think there really is a reason to panic, lol.
---
I don’t think so, at least not reasonably. The angel 10/10 has a rat that deals a massive alpha, in explosive damage. This is known to one shot tengus, which are natively more explosive resistant. Plus the angel rats are weak to explosive and kinetic, which you’ll have trouble with if you choose lasers. It may be doable with a massive buffer misslile legion, but it’ll be a pain, you could try with a friend though.
---
I really didn't think Pando and Shines as people stupid enough to abuse CSM leaks. Guess you never know people ...

As an HR Director in my Corp, it is bad practice to take action without informing those affected. If what you are saying is true, CCP has horribly mismanaged this. If what you are saying is not true, you still belong in EVE. It is a game about deception. While you wouldn’t belong on CSM, I think the permaban is far to extreme. Especially since it can seriously affect your real life job and since it’s likely your first offence.
---
You too
---
I would agree but maybe he shouldn't post it to hundreds of people? :thonking:
---
How does CCP not have some type of Secure Enclave Type set up for this?
---
fly around a market hub station with an expensive kill right. pretty sure between the kill right and insurance he's profiting. hang around amarr undock if you want to get on a kill.
---
LOL, I don't even log onto EVE or this reddit character without going through a serious VPN and taking a whole bunch of other precautions. Not because I do stuff that is wrong but because I have been around long enough to know and understand the RL consequences that Eve can have on players lives. It is also the same reason why I would never run for CSM or even lead an alliance of any meaning, I just don't want the spill over.
---
I am not saying that they should turn over evidence or sth. Just saying it would be more sensible to ban him, inform him about it and then make it public.

Vince broke NDA and didn't get perma banned. I'm not saying he shouldn't be permabanned, but it sounds like we'll have to wait 6 months to a year to know for sure when the features actually released. They obviously can't say what leaked now if thet want to implement the changes that "leaked"

---
only with rice
---
Yea, but lets face it, its still a pretty public position, there will be some pictures etc. at some point, though I have seen the ones where the faces are censored recently. But still, there will be some sort of leak somewhere and someone within or outside of Eve will stumble onto it and recognize the person(s).
---
He was running the mission in eco-mode, forgot to turn to sport when engaging in pvp :)
---
there was that one CSM member from a year or two ago that kept their ID secret and even went to CSM Summit and had their face covered in all the photos released by CCP
---
How? His ingame accounts were banned, not the man himself. If he would have shut-up about his RL job to begin with there coulnt be any defamation. The asshole brought it all on himself.

Without INIT's leadership they will WIDOT into Goons, so this is actually good for Goons!

To be honest I thought csm and their main objective was to give players someone to complain about besides CCP. Nothing I have ever seen contradicts this.
---
I guess they do that well? But certainly nothing that matters to the game. They seem as useful as a warm bucket of piss in a rainstorm in that regard.

Why did they not release the summary of the individual sections by the investigation, smells like a collusion to me.
---
In my opinion, I think it really depends on skills. With decent skills and accounting for cost / benefit... no, there's no good middle ground. There are a number of other options, definitely, and many of them (HACs, Faction Battleships, Marauders) are, strictly speaking, upgrades from a VNI, but they are very poor in cost/benefit in comparison to a carrier if you have the skills. Marauders make less money than carriers but the hulls often cost more than fully fit carriers, and even with the capital insurance nerf, the insurance on carriers is still better. HACs do perform better than VNI but only marginally, but are much more costly. Faction battleships are pretty decent options and often make significantly more isk than a VNI but are only marginally less expensive, after fitting, than a carrier, and a carrier will make you a lot more money.
---
Of course some of what I've said above is based on my personal subjective perspective on value. So it might be better for me to post the tick values I have written down based on my experience with different setups:
---
VNI - 13-18m / tick
---
Ishtar / Cerberus / HAM Loki - 18-22m / tick
---
Tempest (on Angel Forsaken Rally Points *specifically*) - 25m / tick
---
Machariel / Rattlesnake - ~30m / tick
---
Vargur / Golem - ~35m / tick
---
Nidhoggur - 55-65m / tick
---
Bonus: HAW Naglfar - ~100m / tick (inconsistent), but only if you do it *just* right. I'd never do this for real, I only dorked around with it on the test server. 5 min siege is a pain even if you're not in danger of getting jumped; siege isn't like bastion where you can toggle it off and still get all of your damage and most of your projection - when it turns off, your ship pretty much just turns into a limp celery stick, which is a massive pain if you have just a few rats left but don't want to go another whole siege cycle.
---
It's so funny it's the politician. Come on man lol
---
No one's gonna be able to solo back you in 0.6 with a paladin. Bastion is a "fuck you" button, not an "oh shit" button

Me too. To be honest one party trying to fuck the other over is just as likely to me as leaking information and abusing it. Innocent until proven guilty isn't it? If they did it well then fuck them if not well we got someone else to fuck over. I don't think CCP did not look into it first but there shouldn't be a problem with transparenty in fact there HAS to be transparenty in this case.

He was removed in disgrace.

 Hear, hear!

Well this comment aged about as well as cat pee.
---
Well, until CCP shows some evidence that's his only move.
---
Recently back and pretty new to wh life what’s wrong with c4?
---
Ordinarily I would agree with you, but considering Brisc is an actual US politician, makes no effort to separate his two personas, and is acting in a stereotypically GOP manner, I'd say it's relevant.
---
they were all em / thermal, so they won't matter
---
It's not theirs anymore once you're holding a gun to their head.
---
Also: Is their banner a rat's anus?
---
I understand. Still, we would need exact full context info to agree or disagree how it was handled which we do not have. What I'm saying is that there might or might not have been reasons for the way it was handled. And if there were reasons, CCP is not obligated to disclose or discuss them.
---
you should take the initiative and stop posting
---
Ahah if only they were that firm on botters 🤣🤣
---
btfod
---
Okay but let's be honest, ccp has banned people before only to say soeey and unban them. No one here should be beliving anything anyone says without more substance
---
I have a LOT of investment plans . eg I had 10B last week, sold for over 2B just today but reinvested over 5B in BPOs, and increased my available craft material to over 50B (was 45), added more craft lines, started to work on higher volume, etc.
---
Whenever I have too much money, I always have missing stuff to buy  for provision. If I don't have… well I increase my provision or activate new investment plans.The BPOs+material I bought were from an increase in provision and two small investment (the more juicy I had)
---
Brisc spent a bunch of time leading up to the HK invasion trying to claim he was the CSM face of wormholes this term, so he still manages to steal that title too
---
the real friends are the bans we made along the way
---
*Look mom, no hands!*

honestly VNI outshines all other Navy editions so insanely.  like what other Navy ship has the stats so far greater over its normal version that its even viewed as more viable than BCs or Pirate ships

Least surprising insider trading of the game.
---
&gt;Some additional steps to help prevent similar conduct in future will be implemented. Starting from the next summit, we will impose a rule that prohibits electronics during CSM sessions and will take extra time to educate everyone about confidentiality, insider trading and general do’s and don’ts when it comes to operating under NDA.

This is why my blackberry in the past offered phones without cameras for people with security clearances.

Heh $1k of plex is 50 monthly subs at regular not sale prices, drop in the bucket.

Yeah when they lived in catch... That's some years ago and prior to INIT joining the Imperium

this is peak shitposting
---
Yep. There have also been CSM members who wore clothing styles so hideous to CCP photo shoots that nobody was able to focus on them long enough to identify their faces.
---
WHO CHANGED IT TO EX-CSM HELLO
---
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
---
I shall run for CSM on the platform of abolishing the CSM. As CSM, every suggestion or change that is ran by the CSM, I will suggest ways in which a focus group or community team outreach would be more effective. You won't have to worry about me leaking because I don't even play the goddamned game anymore since the AT cancellation announcement.
---
Consider supporting a charity of their choice instead.
---
Dat's the sound of da space police!
---
I would vote for you, even just out of nostalgia to those sweet times you hunted us newbies relentlessly in Rahadalon and surrounding systems.
---
Thanks I wasn’t 100 percent sure off the top of my head how it was spelled.
---
\#ThePeeTapeIsReal
---
I would agree with you in almost every other situation. Really. I honestly hate discussing modern politics of any country in-game or in this subreddit, but the person in question is legitimately a real US Politician from the party mentioned above, which has a *tendency* to be characterized as being a pretty corrupt party, at least by many Americans. More importantly, by breaking this NDA he runs a real chance of at least damaging his RL career as a politician. So in this case, although I don't *like* to be reminded of RL politics, I think it's pretty relevant.
---
Thank you good sir.
---
CSM is volounteer group in a video game
---
it's not a corporation, it's basically a higher council in space version of DnD. CCP owns it and can do whatever it wants to do with it.

The CSM is a pathway to many leaks some consider to be... unethical.

Why not link to the talking in station twitch channel and vod?
---
They are under no obligation whatsoever to release any of that. In fact, they might have legal obligations to not release any info as an NDA break may affect his RL job and livelyhood in a very negative way and this may indeed end up in courts or in front of Bar Association or alike, in which case it is their obligation to not aggravate the situation either by negligence or intentional act. If I were them I would not release anything until everything has come to a full conclusion, which may be years down the line.

Small typo in "Missle Sentry" I think. Thanks for this, pretty useful :)
---
He signed an NDA dude, kinda hard to call it extreme when they'd presumably have very little difficulty getting him in actual legal trouble over it. Seems pretty lenient actually.
---
It appears the best way to get rid of someone in game is to just vote them to the CSM

Could even be things that haven't been released to the public yet as well
---
&gt;The CSM is built on trust and we expect a high level of confidentiality from each member at all times. This requirement is imperative for a few reasons. Firstly, to ensure uninterrupted, close collaboration as we work together on setting up EVE Online for the best possible future. Secondly, to not have our players worry that information shared with the CSM is misappropriated and that the non-disclosure agreement is respected. Lastly, to provide all council members with a safe environment where they can freely discuss all the game-related matters without the risk of details being passed on outside the closed circle. 
---

---
Reading in between the lines, were the meetings recorded under the presumption of taking minutes/other notes, but these recordings shared?  
---
And how did the balance of the CSM become aware of the disclosure?  
---
Cah mahn CCP throw us a bone here.

Either way, I *feel* like CCP wouldn't jump the gun without a solid case.

How does CCP banning a alleged perpetrator make them incapable of detecting leaks? oO

Easy nomination for thread of the year 2019.

ahah

ahahah

ahaahhahahahah
---
Come on now, Suitonia and couple others are pretty good too. I may or may not agree with them and their views, but not everyone on CSM seems to be running an agenda for their respective alliance, coalition or sector of space. It is unfortunately, too many that do seem like it.
---
Its changed a few times now:
---
I have seen:
---
Corrupt Silly Man XIII (My Favorite)
---
Ex-CSM XIII
---
Disgraced Ex-CSM XIII
---
If anything you killed Kappa and that's truly a good thing for everyone
---
its almost like promoting and actively discouraging are not the same thing.
---
It might be related to the recent spike and then drop in plex prices. Maybe he had info about the 15% off using plex to omega thingy. We can only keep guessing.
---
You are talking to me now. And you are getting far more exposure here than you would on TS. I was also hesitant back when I was young to interact on TS, but once I started to, it became easier and easier. To the point that now, it is second nature and brings a far better experience to any game. You don’t have to start a conversation, you can just pop in and say hello, listen in, and see if you want to answer or give input on stuff.
---
Twice in my 16 year career I have been eroniously banned. Me personally, in the alliance I ran saw it happen several times. We were not big public people so you figure it probably happens all the dam time
---
incredible work
---
Brisc has been proven guilty already, thats why ccp released the statement
---
They wouldn’t release a statement when they first caught wind he might be guilty lol
---
Kill the first keepstar ever anchored IN RAGE the most impenetrable wormhole fortress in the history of Eve.  
---
Does Init rest on their laurels???  
---
No they hit the self-destruct button. Nothing else left to do I guess.
---
It's been so long since we had such good drama that I am experiencing euphoria.
---
To be fair, so much shit in the game is AFK ish now, that Reddit and games from fap-nation dot com are the 2 best activities one can do while playing Eve. They sure as hell surpass watching Netflix or doing laundry ...
---
Another Eve drama. 
---
Love it.
---
HK has been seeding leaks for a year. This is the hardest thing we've ever done.
---
Which is exactly why we need transparency. CCP found him guilty so they should have evidence right?
---
For my friends, everything. For my enemies, the law.
---
&gt; Heh, so CCP took fucking years to publish a regular industry standard bi-monthly or quarterly balance pass. GG CCP.
---
For a game that has never once charged you a single penny for an expansion in nearly two decades. Let's be real man, CCP isn't a huge budget studio with hundreds of devs.

That's the intercom whistle sound from Star Trek.

Most likely his text message sound. Kind of cool actually.
---
&gt;holding me accountable to promises I did not make
---
Neither did Brisc. CSM (or GSM, however you want to call it) isn't real life politics and the CSM candidates don't make promises. That's just a list of ideas for the game that he has to make it seem like he's a bright individual so that people would vote for him.

That's a very talented coercer multiboxer you have there. Inhuman reactions! Of course there's no way he could be input broadcasting, as that would be against the EULA and the good people of Frat would never associate themselves with any cheaters.

Once a person is perma banned from Eve, it is the person. Making new account will just result in anotehr perma ban of the said account and related accounts the moment the identity is found out and reported to CCP.
---
i will nominate you for an oscar mate, i havnt laughed that hard in ages.

I mean, it's not really that far of a stretch is it?
---
I wouldn't call it a conspiracy theory. More like a

probably true theory.

Man the EVE community is becoming overrun by self important, pseudo-intelligent SJWs. Sad to see it.

This might really really hurt him.

wasnt this posted yesterday?

loooooooooool :D
---
Am I the only one really bothered by someone using their own grandmother's death as an attempt to stir up sympathy over getting some *fucking video game accounts* banned? Are you kidding me? What the fuck? What the FUCK? I don't even know how to express myself here. I can't imagine bringing a death in my family - even for my relatives who I hate, much less the ones I love - out into a public forum for any fucking reason. At all. It doesn't matter what the context is, if I did something wrong or if I very much didn't, I can not understand what kind of person would ever even consider doing something like this.
---
Context: I have no idea who that person is, I don't know anything about INIT beyond random stuff from this sub and the eve forums, the HK thing, and that one of my favorite youtubers, Lasker, flew with them for a while; I have no skin in this game at all. I have no idea what the "sides" are, if there are any sides. I just can't believe what I'm seeing in that screencap.
---
In fact, I'm having such a hard time believing it, it would be nice if someone with access to the discord could confirm or deny if the pic is even real? It would be really nice to learn it isn't.
---
Can someone link that shitpost about removing c4 space
---
Without a more detailed report I cannot trust CCP or the CSM on this topic.
---
Also I have no idea who Brisc is, but I do have an idea that the CSM is like 99% goonswarm and are we playing GoonSwarm Online yet?

I heard this is where you post your feelings. 
---
The feels I have: None.
---
I can't believe this story you're telling me, it's macabre!
---
I mean in the beginning it was writing a personal mail and sitting in front of it several minutes deciding if I should delete it or just click the send button. Also well it was shortly after i came back from a psychosomatic clinic where i worked hard on my anxiety, depression and obesity.
---
Wow I'm on the reddit, hi mom!
---
&gt;Brisc doesnt give a shit.
---
Yet. Just wait let the fact that he broke an NDA circle around a bit IRL.
---
CCP are amateurs, they didn't even take a year of planning to do this.
---
Are they actually releasing mobile jump disruptors...?
---
removing sleezy politician cunts from eve online 1 at a time.
---
good work ccp
---
I originally changed it to "Corrupt Silly Man XIII" for a bit of a joke but it was pointed out to me that some might see that as Mods taking sides.
---
Given the charged nature of the situation and the fact that it seems Brisc may make an appeal it was changed again to be more neutral.. for now.
---
Hi. Happened to me around 2 years ago, took 31 days to overturn a permaban.
---
So, catching up here.  Brisc was NDA blabbermouth, what was the other two?
---
I literally don't get it.
---
I heard init is recruiting FCs, previous experience within the alliance is a plus.
---
 Eyes forward, capsuleer.....
---
In Eastern Europe there is a retoric that George Soros finances all protest movements. So...
---
soo will ccp release more details about what was leaked? (i know there were leaks before, but i wasnt arround there.. so whats usually what ccp is doing?)
---
He looks like Lindsay Graham's lesbian twin sister.
---
I think he was joking.
---
I mean, if I just pulled the plug on granny and got told I was banned on all my accounts... well it wouldn't make much difference to me since I haven't had an active account in ages, but if I was active and invested? 
---
... yeah, I'd probably make some unfortunate "what the fuck even is my life now?" with a little note of *why* I felt a little fucked over. 
---
That said, in all likelihood he's guilty as fuck and just fishing for sympathy, so fuck'im. On the off chance that he isn't, though, it's not like any of *us* are losing anything by giving him the benefit of the doubt. I can understand the impulse.
---
&gt;And no, I'm too anxious to go out of my way to purposely try and talk to people I don't know. Coming on reddit and making a post is about as social as I can usually manage to get with strangers.
---
&gt;You don't have to start a conversation, you can just pop in and say hello...
---
I promise I'm not trying to nay say everything from you, but you do realise this is literally how you start a conversation, right?  Going out of your way to say something to people in how conversations start.  It then makes me the rude one to listen to people talking and then never responding after I was the one to start the whole thing.
---
So let's go ahead and add on top of the anxiety that I have this paranoia that nobody actually cares or would want to talk to me.  Meaning I don't want to be part of a large corp because obviously they don't care about random lone members at that low of a level.  I doubt even medium sized corps care about their members at an individual level like that.  So the only thing that's left for me is mining in some random corp where nobody knows me because I'm too scared to talk to people.
---
I appreciate you trying to help, but I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to find a place to fit in.
---
&gt;EO: Well, it’s all moot as I guess you have no recourse…why are you smiling?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;BR: Will someone from CCP’s regime please inform them that I, too, have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than theirs. And it works!
---
&gt;At this point, Mr. Rubal began to hug himself and mumble things like make EVE great again while obsessively fixing his hair. However, it appears from his last comment that this story is far from over.
---
:clap:
---
BANNED CSM?
---
Wew
---
There are cases where CCP allowed people to create new accounts, i think.

Carrier changes kinda suck but everything else is ok I guess.

---
Its superior to the VNI in every way
---
only that snake is 400 mil a hull, ishtar is 200 mil, and VNI fitted is 100-120, depending on bling level.
---
What i'd really like to see here is an overwrought AAR writeup for how Brisc and henchmen developed a super seekret clever ploy to smuggle CSM data out of the *council* and use it for nefarious purposes - you know, something on the scale of INIT's typically over engineered smoothe brain retardation.
---
Is that a US-proverb? Asking for a friend...
---
I'm most amused that he was clumsy enough to get caught.
---
Lasker left init a few months ago and is running his own pvp corp in provi.
---
How does this compare with the SLS?
---
I'm already out of the door though.
---
Third actually, you forgot Darius III

This tbh. If he is guilty that's just short dragon tier

Nice story.  As some of my ships already have pink skins I would train to fly that ship.  Cat ears are a nice touch.

Bah hahahhahahahha
---
Ummm. The games that do charge for expansions usually do not have monthly subs, WoW excluded. Take for example POE or GW2. Path of Exile  is not just expansions, but guaranteed free expansions every 3 months or so and has been for years now. 
---
Also outside of very few studios most nowadays are not huge, POE for example Grinding Gear Games is 55 ish employees. GW A-Net had a bunch of layoffs recently, but not from GW2 but from their side projects, much like CCP did in the past.
---
hey puzzle pirates was the shit, don't bring it into this.

At least you got great customer service.. sometimes :D

He’s hoping the evidence is beatable by operation of law not by its factual merit.  He’s slime

puzzle pirates also uses the sound effect for what it's worth.

I guess TEST got the last laugh on this one...

Or he may have dropped 1k in PLEX because he may have had the type of insider information one would need to be very sure that the price of PLEX is going to spike very soon. The type of information that a developer would rather not disclose.
---
Don't know Brisc, but I really hope this isn't all just CCP getting played by Gewns.  If goon leadership stands to gain from these actions, CCP better be taking a really hard look at whatever unbiased evidence they have, especially if it was a goon CSM(s) who reported this shit.
---
There's probably no way to convince the community either way (guilty or framed) unless CCP releases some of the evidence they based their decision off of, and I don't see that happening.
---
what is there that needs explaining?
---
I don't have a dog in this race. However, the Eve servers are located in England now. You can't out right ban someone's account, you have to not allow them to sign up for any services. And because something in-game can be bought with real world money, it is considered physical property. Not allowing someone access to their physical property in Great Britain is considered theft. If the property is unable to be returned or used, the own must be fairly compensated at market value plus tax, but you have to live in Great Britain for this to matter. Just some more weird convoluted British laws from the 1400's.
---
So every tenth of us gets a perma-ban? \*is scared\*
---
“Hoping it’s a mistake” = hoping the evidence is beatable by operation of law and not on the basis of factual merit.
---
Unsubscribe
---
The perma bans are vs persons, not just accounts. If he does this he might be OK for a while until someone fully recognizes him on VOIP and confirms identity then reports it to CCP along with some nice recording or alike. Then he'll be back to square one and the people that set it up for him might be in shit too in addition.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
&gt;I have no idea what the charges are
---
Well, it might behoove you to read the post.
---
Pando and Dark Shines failed to use the initiative and gets snuffed out by CCP. Brisc responds with "Don't tell 'em about the honey, mommy"
---
Kill rights (sold by an alt) + Insurance scams.
---
Basically he's selling Freighter kill mails for a decent profit.
---
Is it possible to learn of these leaks?
---
Its Lasker...
---
I didnt expect anything else than that.
---
If he tries to educate people only half as much as he does with his videos, he is a great dude.

Its a great programm for folks who just want to feel really important. Sad it only works for 10 persons a go. But, hey, better than having them suffer a dirty, irrelevant nerdy life, like the rest of us ;)

A CSM idiot got caught. Imagine what the smart ones are up to. Get rid of the CSM.

Absolutely not
---
:swoon:
---
Brisc Rubal does NOT represent *me*
---
O I would love this. Take as much shit down with you as possible and don't just limit it to CSM.
---
That's not really why. To be fair to whomever they are banning, they really ought to inform him of something like, in this case, "we have proof that you recorded the CSM summit and shared said recording with x, y, and z." 
---
To be fair to CCP, we do not know whether or not they did, or did not, provide this information. I am loathe to take one person's word on it; however, from what has been said by others who have been banned for RMT, CCP *may* have a history of handing out permabans--in all fairness, for things that should result in permabans--but not telling the victim anything about the evidence used to make the decision. 
---
In most things, this would not be a big deal; however, considering how people put years, and in some cases tens of thousands of dollar, into this game it becomes a little bit more important, for me anyway, that CCP be a little more transparent *with the people they are actually banning.*
---
All my mining ships have the R. Dawn skins sold for breast cancer month a few years ago.  Only time I spent real money on a skin and so worth it
---
Not from a game dev.
---
Was he permabanned? That was during my CSM, I should remember this but the dude was so inactive that we actually made a separate CSM coordination channel without him.
---
It's hisec, no reason to warp off.
---
Pretty close to it unfortunately. I mean, Clowns, buffoons, POTUS ...
---
Absolutely perfect.
---
Considering he's a lobbyist, breaking actual legal enforceable NDAs is not a great move for his RL.

Astrahus and Raitaru are identical, but nice work.

Hed's problem is he cares too much. He's not mad at us, he's just disappointed. He wants us to be the best that we can be.
---
It is hard, even for me, to imagine that CCP would make a mistake with something this big...
---
Pando
---
If you catch someone breaking the rules for a ban, just ban them. Don't tell them what you know, it lets people find ways to get around it. Keep your mouth shut and let idiots keep making the same mistake over and over. The rules aren't exactly vague.
---
Don't think so. On the meta show recently Aryth was talking about plex price stuff from the CSM's perspective and said they don't have any contact with the marketing/sales department, ie the guys who made the plex promotion.
---
Bug. Will fix!

It's... amusing that we've come full circle, from a place and a pacth that caused Burn Jita from a lack of listening to players and a lack of substantial change and improvement in Eve to a place where the player board to give feedback is to blame.
---
The ones who used the NDA information. They only got a one year ban.
---
He is a member of the CSM who also happens to be a politician real life.
---
I really liked that one. I was able to buy one but I couldn’t afford anymore at the time.
---
why the fuck do you get your peace windmill flair but mods steal mine :(
---
Bliss is still in action.
---
All this does is help give information to people who want to do this in the future and tell them how to get around it.
---
CCP has no obligation to show us the evidence of why they banned him. Especially because the reason is because of breaking NDA. 
---
Also CCP never releases details on bans period. So asking for it is about as fruitfull as trying to walk through a brick wall.
---
Ф
---
It's too late I hear. It seems their "valued Imperium allies" are trying to hoover up any corps they can.
---
We've had 4?
---
He’s a regular on the mainstream podcasts “Open Comms” and Talking in Staions” and holds a high profile lobbying job in Washington.  He was elected to the CSM and as part of that is privy to unreleased developer information that he then leaked to members of his alliance to use to profit in game.
---
United States politician who was a member of CSM 13 got caught violating NDA, corruption and insider trading/racketeering.
---
Someone doesn't understand how cloaky afkers work.
---
Like fine milk
---
honestly that's what i thought as well. "what CSM member is so concerned about pando blowing up his rorqs that he just let's get him banned?"
---
They lose 5 battles in row they win one. 1 month of celebration.
---
True that, and I wish no luck with either thank you very much
---
There's a good chance you're right, I literally forgot he existed.  He was a CSM alternate whose only claim was that he gifted CCP a giant monocle and would post "I might get banned for this but" and then making completely obvious statements.
---
ITS THE SOUND OF THE POLICE
---
To quote you from the eve-o forums, you are you sure that you are sure you did not "leak anything ***that could be monetized?***" 
---
I mean seems like a straight admission you did leak, but thought that whatever you leaked could not be monetized and, unfortunately for you, it turns out someone monetized it.
---
That’s what they did, told him why he was banned- He shared information covered by the NDA with two others. And is now banned for it. It’s right there in the post.
---
They are under no obligation to make it easier for people to break the NDA or rules by spelling out exactly what all their information is. And contrary to your last point, they really should be telling us why an elected player representative is suddenly removed.
---
I thought rapid heavies were better to speed along the death of the smaller stuff.
---
I mean the part about the electronics is probably pointless. All of the CSM members are grown adults. I expect them to be able to memorize what is gonna get buffed/nerfed/added.
---
I remember his name all too well. He would constantly come into our previous staging system of O-V and have story time with us in local.
---
I've not seen him around for awhile...I miss his stories. :(
---
like fine wine, I say...
---
Darkshines and pando already confirmed.
---
i miss puzzle pirates
---
Ya...NO.  He knows why he got banned without a doubt.
---
I’m sorry I couldn’t convince you otherwise. I truly do think that everyone can find a place where they are accepted and appreciated. This game appreciates new players more than any other game. 
---
I hope you too can realize that this game has great people who really do care. Not everyone will care, but a lot of people grow very fond of each other over long periods of time playing this game, and believe me, it will be long periods of time if you give the game, and its people, a chance. 😁
---
I will not pry any more. Just know, that everyone has a place amongst a group of people. You just have to put yourself out there. Sometimes you miss, but you keep trying. Safe/dangerous flying (which ever you prefer)
---
I literally only remember him because he leaked CSM skype logs onto 4chan, and the CSM for our 4chan corp (White Tree) was accused of it before they worked out it was Darius
---
roasting an ironic pleb
---
I guess you got that evidence then
---
Ok
---
Same here, I used to see them up here on reddit frequently. I always liked reading them.
---
OK you got me.

You think that the elitist and entitled masses of INIT would be absorbed wholesale into the goon?
---
it made me really nervous that he didnt zoom out as you warped in...
---

Disclaimer: I am not associated with any NS group or bloc
---
Honestly I would love Init to reform themselves a bit after this and splinter from Goons, maybe go move to some other region entirely. I do not want to see them implode and be gone from the game and I absolutely do not want to see them get fully absorbed into Goons because as you pointed out, they are good content drivers. if they do get fully absorbed into Goons after this shitshow or as a result of it, then their content driving will be pretty much over. They will still be part of the content, but no longer initiate it.

Mate, i'm pretty sure CCP investigates this thoroughly as this is a fairly large decision for them to make. Don't pull that shit, it'll only ruin your reputation even further when you try to do stuff in the future in different communities.
---
You said 2 months ago that [the CSM is a dream job](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ageejg/breaking_its_official_im_resigning/)

. Apparently it's only a dream job when you abuse it and break trust. Get outta here!

I just realized halfway through the comments that I wasn't even logged in to Reddit at the time, and this is still on the front page. Internet spaceship drama best drama.

I live in lowsec 20 jumps from jita. I only buy with buy all and multifit. The annoyance of logging in the wallet/hauling alt and shipping more ships keeps my spending in check.
---
I don't know. Maybe. With a proverbial capital "M". I admit it, would be a situation where one might be more predisposed than usual towards making horrible, horrible decisions. But I honestly, *honestly* can't imagine posting anything in public about something like this. I have an uncle who I legitimately abhor, but he's never going to end up in a discord ping. There is a famous youtuber (who I won't name specifically because it's unnecessary) who somewhat recently lost a loved one in a car accident, and was public that it occurred in order to explain that he expected to be absent for a while. This *comes off* as crazy to me as if that individual had posted "First that, and now my videos are being demonetized? What next?". 
---
Still holding out hope it's just fake or edited :(
---
Well they banned two guys on top of him so I'm going to guess not a widespread cabal of people on this. That's sort of the rub with stuff like this, if you're doing it to make money while no one knows, you can't really tell a lot of people. I'm going to take a guess and say they only told the people who they know were involved (and banned) or those that knew had good plausible deniability about it. It does no good to tell the entire top leadership because it spreads the risk but no rewards.
---
It'll backfire in the long run, they were hoping to buy enough time to sell their narrative.
---
Up is down, down is up
---
Calm down Harddon
---
Correct, now imagine for a second, I accused you of RMT. I told CCP that stabbi is an RMTer, then they banned you for "RMT." 
---
Since you are *not* actually an RMTer it would pretty fucking frustrating, do you not think, if you petitioned the ban and CCP just ignored you. Would you not, in that case, want to know *what* exactly they are basing your RMT ban on? 
---
If instead of ignoring you, they said, "this guy ZombieLenin told us you were an RMTer, so we banned you..." you could then escalate the petition and point to this thread, and say "that guy is full of shit!" 
---
I do not know, call me old fashioned, but I think the accused should have the right to confront the exact accusation against him, guilty or not... precisely because human beings are not perfect, and while I trust CCP to make the right call 95% of the time, I know 5% of the time they will not... and if you are a person who falls into that 5% after playing EVE for 13 years and spending thousands of dollars investing in CCPs virtual world, it really seems unfair that you were not even given the decency of being told, "we are banning you because our logs show you did x, y, and z" or "we received evidence you violated your NDA by revealing this to these people, who turned around and used that information to insider trade."
---
heh, look at the currently second from top post on that sub
---
This is the most lawyer-speak-y lawyer speak I've ever heard.
---
racer gaming chair confirmed!
---
I switched to 2 types of P1's from one planet for a few reasons:
---
- because I have low sec 0% tax production planets available (so free imports and exports later)
---
- because I want to maximize the P1's being extracted avoiding situations such as long links and advanced factories cut too much into what could be extra extractor heads
---
- additionally because I want to maximize on P1's trying to stick 10 extractor heads on one hot spot is often difficult, yet alone 12-14 (with 2 extractors if better skills)
---
- and also because I am managing 52+ planets there is not enough time to be meticulous such as when trying to place a P0&gt;P2 setup perfectly within reach of the raw materials it needs
---
- finally (at least off the top) because of previous points mentioned I run extraction on 3 day cycles (so I have time to do other things and not constantly be turning on extractors); so this means that materials extraction can be tight by day 3. Because of this I only run 2-3 basic processors on a planet that might have 12 extractor heads, expecting that I won't come collect for at least a week or two.
---
TLDR its mostly about maximizing the raw extraction
---
Also, without a low tax production planet, this strategy is not practical (all of your profits will go to taxes).
---
The other csm's told ccp about the leak. They didn't find it themselves.

---
??? You words have 0 reference to my statement and make no sense.
---
~The accused~
---
They investigated, that’s how they banned the people he shared the information with. AND undid their transactions. Pretty cut and dry. They then told him “others on the csm shared your breaking the NDA, we banned you for it, and we undid  the profits you and the two people you’ve shared info with made.” Pretty different from the straw man you’re tilting at.
---
I'm always nice to people who gave me free purples.

10:1 it was The Judge that turned him in.
---
&gt;this misconduct was brought to us by the CSM themselves as an immediate threat to the integrity of the CSM as an institution
---
Sounds like something he would do. Whatever you say about him, The Judge loves EVE, CCP and the CSM.

I haven’t....

Well, if he doesn't defend himself in court, he is probably guilty or doesn't like himself very much.

They really should RL-spy on all CSM members to prevent this kind of behaviour. 
---
^^(/s)

EVE Players - "Cheaters suck, ban them"

CCP- "Ok we announce we are banning someone caught red handed."

REDDIT - 6% downvoted said reddit post about cheater being banned.      
---
This post should be 131% upvoted.   I hope it makes front page for the internet world to see.
---
lol so true
---
&gt;CCP better be taking a really hard look at whatever unbiased evidence they have
---
Am sure they did, a lot, its too high profile not to and they were fully aware of shitstorm it would create before taking actions.
---
As for releasing info, they shouldn't, as all this may have some serious RL very negative side effects for Brisc. So they should not share any info whatsoever until the related matters have all come to conclusions, which frankly speaking may be years down the line.
---
haha, don't think corrections like this are going to get old any time soon

Do they release info about botters or credit card fraudsters? There is your answer. A ban is a ban, that’s all we need to know, not details

Not really. Just ban him and end it. Don't need to tell him anything. He doesn't need to be informed of anything.

---
Here, have a downvote. FYI I am not associated with Goons or any NS bloc or group for that matter.
---
&gt; How? His ingame accounts were banned, not the man himself.
---
They publicly accused him of breaking an NDA. Given his profession that's a fairly serious accusation which could very much impact his IRL career.
---
Unfortunately for him given his background in politics he'd probably be considered a public figure. If that's the case it's almost impossible for him to win because a public figure has to prove actual malice not just negligence. Any other CSM member could win by proving CCP made an accusation without checking first. He has to prove that they made the accusation *knowing* it was a lie.
---
eh its preference. i just use cruise.
---
&gt; Am I the only one really bothered by someone using their own grandmother's death as an attempt to stir up sympathy
---
Depends on if this is something he's been talking with them about for a while now or if he's just randomly pulling it out of nowhere. 
---
One of my corpmates has been talking to us about a terrible recent life event.
---
I see what you did here :P
---
Honestly if this comes down to a court battle ( something your implying ), the evidence will likely become public anyway.
---
=/
---
guilty until proven innocent.  so i gonna hold on on condemning him till i see whats going on
---
some random joe vs a CSM member that go through additional scrutiny by CCP, I highly doubt there was any mistake here...
---
So my big issue with this is that other CSM members apparently brought this to CCPs attention. Now if CCP would've seen something I could understand it as they have way more information about what people do ingame than those guys do. But other CSM members (unless involved) would have VERY little information about it. 
---
Now if these accusations are true I rly do not think that Shines and Pando would have these kind of conversation in a non opsec way. 
---
There are just too many things that make me question the validity of this.
---
&gt;Next they'll be telling everyone he was mentally unstable.......
---
Nah, that will be him ,standing in front of Bar Association ...
---
Whether you like it or not, CCP are under absolutey no obligation to abide by innocent until proven guilty. That's a legal standard. And while breaking a NDA can be a legal a matter, banning someone from a game is not legal action.
---
Jesus that fit. Back when I was new I flew lvl4's in a Megathron. And even that fit was more useful than that shit. There's no way he's making money of those missions with the faction ammo.
---
This is the first I've heard of this guy and after reading a bit of backstory, it's the most delicious little nugget I have ever tasted, all wrapped up without me ever having to engage with what a cocksucker this guy obviously is. 
---
Not seen a meatball this spicy in years oh man it feels great. I guess he just couldn't help himself not being the center of attention for 5 minutes.
---
Respect for Pando and Dark Shines has been lost as well. I mean, even if we give them the benefit of the doubt, and say that they didn't use the info, why didn't they let CCP know that Bitch Rubal was going around and breaking the NDA?
---
In situations like these, if you are silent, you are part of the problem. A 1 year ban feels justified.
---
"Until I know more, I'm gonna simply deny doing any wrong..."
---
Ahahahahahahahaha... guilty.
---
"Politician"
---
If this is true, I am not sad to see Brisc gone. Sorry to hear Pando and Shines might have got involved.
---
&gt;Typical goon response, using humor as a deflection
---
I love that "Disgraced..." is the more neutral.
---
I mean, he'll know he's banned when he logs in and it say's "You're banned" and he reads an article saying he was banned but CCP doesn't need to write him an email explaining this. 
---
Unless you want them to send him an email saying "You're banned and off the CSM. Love, CCP" But they shouldn't tell him why and anything they tell him would just be a copy of what they tell us so why bother doing two separate things.
---
Brisc would like to know your location.
---
Panic time confirmed.
---
I have a question. How can you be so stupid as to leak after signing an NDA?
---
Brilliant mate xD

Welp glad I  changed my mind about running missions out off there.
---
I mean, I am not a fan of Market by any means, but from looking at the stream, that was probably the highlight of the year actionwise.  
---
Running security missions with t1 acolytes as the primary source of damage that guy would probably be better using a Myrmidon.
---
I dindu nuffin!
---
probably is in Texas tho...
---
&gt; Honestly if this comes down to a court battle ( something your implying ), the evidence will likely become public anyway.
---
True. Hence it would be at that point we might find out what really happened. Though I doubt there would be an actual court battle, if it did get up to courts there would most likely be settlement, in which case, we still might not find out.
---
Thank you.
---
This could out to be the worse thing to happen for Brisc or best thing to happen
---
I've been winning eve for like 2 years and don't know who this guy is, but I just want to be part of the phenomenon, so here I am.
---
In a criminal trial in most developed countries (or in any fair justice system, in my opinion), sure. But this isn't a criminal offense or trial, there are no "charges", and no legal or ethical need for any sort of "due process" in any sort of official capacity. CCP has the right to ban players for NDA or EULA breaches - cheating, etc - and they have the authority to determine if an action constitutes a breach of NDA or EULA. They have taken no action to identify Brisc's RL identity: he attached his in-game identity to his RL one himself, so he has no grounds for a lawsuit over any damages to his RL reputation, either.
---
I also really doubt that CCP has anything short of total proof. Just because the proof has not been made public doesn't mean he has not been proven guilty. Depending on the nature of the leak, it's possible that making the proof public would result in making the leak public, which could have a significant negative in-game impact for players, as well as damage CCP's business. The only lawsuit I can see happening (I don't expect it to, but it could happen) is one against Brisc, by CCP, for losses caused by him denying wrongdoing, which creates pressure for them to release business-sensitive information in order to publicly "prove" wrongdoing.
---
Usually being accused of corruption is a pretty bad thing to have happen. Hope CCP got it right here.
---
Not that you're wrong, but most facilities that have similarly confidential information have rules like this. I know a guy who worked for an alphabet soup agency in the US, he couldn't bring any electronics into his building at all. Had to leave his cell and laptop in the car.

---
You do know that CCP has a internal affairs division right? 
---
That divisions sole purpose is to keep track of CCP employees and CSM members and also keep a eye on the volunteers. 
---
Meaning that from all the players in this game CSM members are basically the most scrutinized players. 
---
And for once ccp does give some clue in their post. Saying that electronic are banned during future summits. 
---
Given the fact csm members reported it. Then knowing ccp makes a statement about electronic devices. And knowing that those players are under constant monitoring. Gives me enough confidence that CCP did not do this on a whim.

I have said it multiple times, Goons have been around for a while and are good at this kind of shit, this while Brisc shitstorm is just the tip of the iceberg, but to get all the evidence you'd need to be part of the inner circle and good luck spending your time getting in there to leak all the shit that's going on...

I mean, he does it publicaly through open society.

&gt; Guild Wars 2 charges you for the base game and the expansion fam. And POE is a microtransaction based game - something CCP started doing recently with skins and cosmetics got rekt by the community for it. You pay a monthly sub so that CCP can continue to exist.
---
heh, to give you a cost comparison, I spent around $60-$70 on POE microtransactions, most of this, like 40-50 went into stash tabs, rest for some skins, and I have been perfectly able to play POE to the fullest for last 3 years on that. I might buy some skins in the future if any leagues pike me as particularly good content, which will cost me around $10 or $20. And which I will feel the devs of that game absolutely deserve.
---
For GW2, You can get the game now with all expansions in it for like $20-$30 depending on sales etc. maybe even less, then again put like $20 into it for inventory and you are set, for at least a few years until another expension.

GOP lobbyist, involved in scandal??? NEVER!!! NEVVVERRRRR

Unfortunately for Brisc CCP doesn't tolerate blatant corruption like Washington does.

Inb4 some absolute madlad just builds it by himself using only a venture

you know shit's getting hot when goonies are asking for the identity of the whistleblower... if CCP release that info the guy's literally dead...

That is not how this works, or how it is spelled.

Mom, get the camera!
---
this is completely the wrong attitude for an r/eve mod
---
&gt;Schoeneman is a member of The Initiative, a massive and reputable alliance
---
&gt; reputable alliance
---
Debatable. Maybe next ment notable.
---
the first being the best
---
Is there a button to take a huge dump on that casket?
---
Yeah i dunno dude thats mega tinfoiling
---
On that pic you can see him holding all of his accounts
---
Check the top post, Brisc is kill (ingame) and took INIT others with him
---
I meant that the fact of him breaking the NDA is public.
---
We had 3 guys making the same joke at the same time in my corp discord lol
---
It's not my decision to make due to rules on alliance affiliation / modbias. But I can say we haven't talked much about it the flair yet. When others have been kicked we simply set the flair to "ex CSM" and moved on. We'll probably talk about it later but for right now it's not a big priority when compared to the huge amount of threads / comments.
---
usually but let's not forget what his party's like, it's more likely to be the sort of thing that gets him a promotion
---
What he did was very cool, *very legal*.
---
In last year's CSM elections, /u/_TheJudge approached several large-scale SP farmers and bought their votes. I think he paid 500mil per account's vote; I can't remember for sure, but I can probably look it up. He bought around 500 votes iirc, 42 of which were mine.
---
Without those purchased votes, /u/Tikktokk would've taken the last spot on the CSM instead of TheJudge.
---
A lobbyist being accused of corruption is probably likely to get him MORE job offers not less! It's in the job description. It's like "accusing" the sky of being blue.
---
Justice is served, get this guy outa here
---
It helps if you think you can get away with it,
---
I mean technically their is no ground for deforming him also, but probably not what he meant.
---
What is his political work IRL?
---
Watch out or I'll deform you instead.
---
i was joking but now i've got my :thinking: hat on
---
can trump pardon?
---
What happened to the PCgamer article, looks like it got pulled.

ps: CCP Guard hasn't left the building and CCP Dopamine is already flexing his muscles or is even being used in the meta ?!
---
I didn't think he could be any less coherent, but there it is.
---
In my dual rattles I've been pulling in 350mil/hr. It's nice
---
Damn...I'm much less clever than I thought. Also Brisc clearly has a future as a Clinton impersonator if the lobbyist thing falls through.

Looks like  they just made a title correction.
---
Not funny for us but this meme is good !
---
&gt; In a criminal trial in most developed countries (or in any fair justice system, in my opinion), sure. But this isn't a criminal offense or trial, there are no "charges", and no legal or ethical need for any sort of "due process" in any sort of official capacity.
---
Nonsense.   
---
There is absolutely an ethical need for due process in any system that hopes to have any integrity or fairness which includes how business-customer relations.  
---
There may, or may not, be a legal case to be made here but there's absolutely an onus on CCP to prove their case.  
---
&gt;CCP has the right to ban players for NDA or EULA breaches - cheating, etc - and they have the authority to determine if an action constitutes a breach of NDA or EULA. They have taken no action to identify Brisc's RL identity: he attached his in-game identity to his RL one himself, so he has no grounds for a lawsuit over any damages to his RL reputation, either.
---
That's not how that works.  Defamation is absolutely on the table here and who is responsible for associating the game account with the RL person is not remotely relevant to whether or not the company has accused the customer of breach of contract.  
---
The rest is all speculation.
---
I mean, tweeting about it from your personal account doesn't either.
---
at least honeymonstars molok is safe for a year
---
No legal obligation, no.  That's not to say there isn't an ethical obligation because there most certainly is.  That said based on self-inflicted harms CCP has committed in the past it wouldn't be the first laughably bad move on their part to let this fester unaddressed.
---
Meh they all do it, this guy just got caught.
---
So he didn’t leak the weebatar?
---
Little did you know we seeded the comments with Fs years ago in anticipation of this moment.
---
   It ok he can continue his scum sucking ways irl.
---
I guess it was during the huge wave in 2013. That software was so widespread at that time CCP did only 3 (iirc, might have been 7) day bans.
---
I am the judge here.
---
And so are you.
---
I get to judge whether CCP is a company worth buying a service from or not.
---
Then why are you on reddit. Get back to work!!! 😂
---
Fake News?
---
Cat ears confirmed?
---
I was genuinely asking because I haven't seen or talked to Bobmon in years :(
---
Boom, roasted!
---
Ruh roh
---
Ohhhh so that explains why the bulgarians are one of the few who "live" there. 
---
You can't kill what is already dead.
---
   Don't talk bad about the CSM they said in that shit video trying to appeal to my moral side.
---
So precautions and them saying so is enough for you? That is great but it is not for me. I can garantee you that if you look hard enough into every CSM member there are things that could proof that they broke the NDA but they didn't it's coincedence. Now if you get accused of breaking the NDA by other CSM members that proof can be enough to force a reaction you want to keep the integrity of the game as much as you can after all. Look I don't say they are innocent but I stopped blindly following accusations a long time ago. Innocent until proven guilty and I see no proof.
---
Jesus.  Some of you people are seriously deranged.  It's just a fucking video game!
---
\&gt;Taking Doom seriously
---
wew
---
M8, you're being a bit too obvious with the blatant advertising of that trash stream
---
What a cool country, they should use hyperthreading next
---
I'm not gonna froth at the mouth like most of these other morons because I don't have the hate-boner for you that they all do, but I will say that I don't understand the point of doing all the work you did - and it was a lot, nobody with a brain stem can deny that - and then get caught doing something like this. My opinions on anyone willing to trudge through American politics as a profession aside, I guess I'm more disappointed than anything that a productive member of the CSM was blatant enough about breaking the NDA to unite the rest of the CSM in the attempt to rectify your wrong(s). Also, since you've tied this game and your real life name so inextricably, I don't imagine this will have a positive effect (if any, I guess) on your actual career as it proves you're willing to break confidentiality if it benefits you. Either way, thanks for the work you did do, and I guess enjoy finding another game to play.
---
Or he really likes burning shit down. But hey, the guy is really good at it. Tossing the match into the gas drenched dumpster is very EVE.
---
It's not the camera it's the ability to transmit/receive/record data. 
---
Gotta get a special waiver for things like hearing aids and other medical devices that have send/receive capabilities. If your pacemaker isn't approved you're not allowed in.
---
Anything with on board memory is a no go. Anything with a male plug is a no go (to include things like pure analog headphones). Anything that can send/receive is a no go. Pretty much anything with batteries is a no go as well. 
---
If your mechanical watch has a mechanical pedometer it's gotta get pre-approved as well.
---
Youre not gonna get more attention from me anymore than this comment and a downvote without reading.
---
what they do?
---
Looks almost like a wizard hat
---
 The AT Hydra ''Boom,Headshot '' video playing in my head now
---
Then I would recommend you quit looking because ccp will never release the proof yet they are guilty. Based on a NDA that is signed and has now been broken. 
---
So I bid you the best of luck in eve.
---
That's not remotely how defamation works.
---
Brisc absolutely has a case if CCP doesn't have the evidence they purport to have.
---
Saying the csm is probably leaking is like saying the government isnt keeping secrets from us.
---
Replace the whole CSM, it's only a bunch of snobby goons anyway.
---
still waiting for context about the leak.
---
so i gonna downvote ya and move on.
---
most of us are retarded and cant even align. spodbless him for carrying us to glory
---
&gt;He was elected to the CSM and as part of that is privy to unreleased developer information that he then leaked to members of his alliance to use to profit in game.
---
**allegedly**
---
i said don't get triggered
---
I'm guessing he got burned (Brisc Rubal) on the change over from CCP Guard leaving at the end of March, and the new CSM CCP bridge coming in, just starting at CCP in Jan of 2019 (CCP Dopamine), and other CSM members restating their concerns and evidence to him more directly. What I am guessing is, CCP Guard didn't see, or interpret as an issue something Brisc was doing (or obfuscating maybe), that was likely grey to the black as Hell. Then new guy comes in, nothing to go on but stated CCP policy, the NDA to the letter, and a few CSM folks stating how they were not cool with activities they were aware of. Brisc is a real life lawyer, knows what culpable deniability and other go to sophistry/polemics is, 'I wasn't aware that was not allowed' defense, and 'Ran it past CCP staff' alibi will be the go to here most likely.
---
Sure pando is innocent he is poor as fucked in game... hope they could have this stuff fixed. shines is the contrary he is space rich. Both are good guys and not cheater...
---
You’re a fucking idiot if you think they ban people cause some twit reported them.  
---
There’s an investigation that concluded.  Moreover it sounds like members of the CSM themselves contributed facts material to the investigation.
---
No they don't, they can ban a player for whatever the hell they want to, and accuse them of whatever the hell they want to. If you link your real life identity to your eve account, that's on you and only you.

Ok I tried https://ashyin.space/brisc-rubal-permabanned-for-nda-breach/
---
PCG released one 10 minutes before I sent mine in so I put it on my own site ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Now tell us who it was, we need more drama
---
Wait people still read pcgamer?
---
The head-scratcher for me is that he appears to be streaming from the bedroom of a 12-year-old girl.
---
K
---
I mean, CCP has access to plenty of logs that we can’t see, in addition to whatever leaks the other CSM members gave them. I doubt they’d go this far unless they were pretty damn sure
---
pls release long form report.
---
at the BBQ with the wizard hat!
---
I have a written budget...
---
There*
---
Can someone tl;dr so I don't have to listen to his annoying voice.
---
&gt;No they don't, they can ban a player for whatever the hell they want to, and accuse them of whatever the hell they want to
---
Nope.  That's not how this works.  They can ban them, sure, but they can't post news articles on their website accusing them of violating NDA's and the like without wading well into defamation territory.
---
6% of Reddit is the alts Init have been seeding for the past year
---
You're missing my point. No one should trust anyone without any more evidence.  "Ccp said so" isn't very convincing at all
---
Well damn. I made a really good fit with a nice active armor rep and huge resists. What ships are you supposed to use for an angel 10/10?
---
I'm not, just recommending you the best course of action mate, you are gonna find a shit ton of info.
---
Right he was allegedly banned today too.  Without cause I’m sure. All of this is pure speculation.  2 others associated with the infraction were also allegedly banned too.
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with Legacy.  Only people i've seen that leave nasty grams in alliance mails are usually Carebears that are told to man up and fight.
---
You're over the game but eve is and has been pretty stale and the only thing that's been happening is the same nullblock circlrjerk that's been happening for awhile
---
What's the CFC?
---
Almost everything you said is wrong;
---
Very few bankers got prosecuted
---
I'm not aware of any victims being compensated, can anyone get sources on that?
---
We voted on a constitution reform, but nothing has happened in that regard.
---
The rest appears to be pure fantasty.
---
bee man bad
---
Normally I would be pissed at PC Gamer for releasing this info, but since he is a politician  he really deserves everything that is coming to him
---
Buhbye troll with your bait and switch title
---
Can CCP ban Olmeca for leaking verbal diarrhea all over reddit?
---
damn, didn't take long for this to hit the "gaming industry news"
---
That's worlds more coherent than any real Trump tweet.
---
he's live again btw
---
I mean yea he got banned for NDA leaks but at least he isn't you.
---
Paranioa mode on.
---
Yeah imperium has won eve and nobody can beat us. Ccp kills goon by hardnerfing rorqual and super / carrier ratting and they killed today the most fighter ally of the imperium by banning our 2 strategic fc.
---
Mod paranoia off
---
Hope pando and Shines can prouvr their innocence but as their is one post of the devblog about that, it will be very hard.
---
I mean this isn't really a problem.  How many people are in INIT?   Surely the loss of two fcs won't be that impactful to an alliance of thousands.  Surely there are others in the alliance that know how to play the game.
---

A stopped clock is right twice a day.

Nah, the ones that finished terms just get left as CSM 11 or whatever. I think it's a good choice.

I'm sure he's currently getting his cousin Risc Bubal up to speed on how EVE works
---
His ign is pretty well tied with his irl

Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. All those little son of a guns. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.
---
If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We'll put a happy little bush here. Be brave.
---
See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.
---
The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. And right there you got an almighty cloud. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.
---
If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.
---
And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.
---
Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.

Sad day :(
---
Welp
---
CCP said other CSM members turned Brisc in. So, unless some of them start speaking up about how he’s innocent, then he’s probably guilty. It’s not like the GSM has a meta reason to headshot one of their biggest alliances.
---
I assume he's just trying to say the alliance members aren't accused of anything in this.
---
:)
---
Most Opsec stream I've seen in a while.
---
I don't keep up with most of the shitposters these days. Is OP just Gevlon's alt?
---
Based and goonpilled
---
A corrupt politician? Ho ho ho, what a surprise!!!
---
In fairness, you're right - they get caught all the fucking time. The difference here is he got *punished*
---
&gt; Whether you like it or not, CCP are under absolutely no obligation to abide by innocent until proven guilty.
---
For a ban absolutely. If they didn't do their due diligence though the press release may cause them some problems.
---
lul
---
It's no longer accusing, it's already a statement that he violated the NDA. Of course Brisc can lawyer up and counter that statement in court, only if he win that first then we can talk about defamation.
---
And either way, CCP has full rights to disclose or not disclose detail evidence of the violation to public, the only ones that could has access to the evidence (say if it really go to court, which I highly doubt so) will be the judge and juror, and they cannot disclose the info as well because another NDA is on them.
---
that worried me a bit too actually

:Thonking:
---
It could be a mistake, wouldn't be the first or the last time this happened. But we have 2 other players banned and appearently evidence of actions taken in-game based on this leaked information, which makes me think that CCP had to have had some damning evidence to take this sort of action.
---
I like it
---
Papa goon still loves you init
---
Har har har.
---
But also, yes. We're healthier than we've ever been! :D
---
His own doing though
---
Because, you know, alliances have never fallen apart after losing a leader. Init is in better shape because they won’t be under much outside pressure since they have goons to back them up, but that doesn’t mean they won’t failscade either.
---
Time to give this clip an outing...[game over man, game over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsx2vdn7gpY).

can i put a tinfoil hat on and say there is some t20 people going out of there way to remove top people form alliances that my cause some trouble
---
nonsense. CCPs game they can do whatever they want. nobody is entitled to anything, they're free to ban for any reason they want.

Oof, that's some aggressive wound salting right there.

I'm blaming autocorrect but we both know that's a lie.
---
Yes they can, because they never once mention anything to do with his real life identity. They only ever identify him by his in game character name. Again I say it, he chose to link his real life identity with his eve character, not CCP.
---
Can we remove the rest of them too?

Oof, too real

Get your bags of shit ready to mail to CCP - they are full of it and stink.  Release proof or GTFO CCP.

Everyone knows the csm leaks, and tbh barely anyone cares at this point.
---
Its just that brisc apparently dosent know how to leak properly without being banned and the fact that he is a corrupt politician which makes this so funny.
---
I doubt many people actually care that someone broke an nda, its just funny.
---
It’s a reference to The Judge, he’s not being serious

It looks like Brisc just got... Noobmaned. 😎

WHAT THE HELL MAN HOW WAS EVE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU ALREADY!?

If the CSM is majority Goons/Imperium, and CCP flatly stated that it was the CSM themselves who turned Brisk over, then your theory has a hole in it.
---
Also, lol at Brisk being one of the "higher ups".

latest news most of eve deploys to fountain
---
Raitaru is the same as astrahus
---
Doesn't matter where the link came from; the link existed in the public realm before their statement and the statement is not accusing the ingame character of violating the NDA but the real person who owns the account.  
---
It's like if I were to make defamatory statements about Stormy Daniels.  It doesn't matter that I didn't personally link Steffanie Cliffords to Stormy Daniels, that's already public information and well known so to claim the pseudonym did something doesn't protect me from defamation against the actual person.  
---
To claim Stormy Daniels is guilty of something is to claim Steffanie Cliffords is guilty of it.  
---
To claim Brisc Rubal is guilty of something illegal, such as violating a NDA, is to claim Brian S. is guilty of it.  
---
To do so very prominently and publicly on your media news website while citing your organization as the source of your claims puts you in even more dangerous territory than just a news media site would be for reporting on allegations as CCP is both the source and publisher of this false information.
---
I think that only applies to known bots

Oruze literally #1
---
Your/our opinion doesn't matter. CCPs NDA was breached, it's up to CCP internal affairs to determine the appropriate actions to take. If due the visibility they decide to release information as a PR move, great. But they are under no obligation to do so and what your opinion is on the evidence and level of guilt are irrelevant. Due to the sensitive nature of these bans and the fact that atleast brisc's RL job might actually be impacted however slightly by any such wrong doing (even if it's a community leader role in a video game). I'd suspect they'll keep the details under wraps.
---
Look at them little rascals. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. The light is your friend. Preserve it. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.
---
Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. You are only limited by your imagination. There he comes.
---
Here's something that's fun. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Imagination is the key to painting.
---
Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. There we go. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.
---
I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Brown is such a nice color. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.
---
This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Let's have a little bit of fun today.
---
God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. It's cold, but it's beautiful. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.

Was there really anything more to expect from somebody whose RL career requires him to be immoral, corrupted and sociopathic in order to get up the career ladder ?

But i like details x)

No, people got permanent bans for this as well.

I second this. I wanna reprocess the old POS towers that are all around my home
---
&gt; false information
---
Problem is, it's not false information, CCP has full right to explain the situation, and unless there's a court order claiming the NDA violation is invalid, the CCP article is considered truth and always true. You can't legally defame somebody by telling truth.
---
If I say Trump cheated his wife and had sex with Stormy Daniels in public, that's not defamation even Mr Trump won't like it, because it is a truth unless there's a legal jurisdiction ruled otherwise.
---
honk honk

&gt; a community leader role in a video game
---
I'd say it won't be so much over the video game aspect and more to do with the fact that space drama aside, it comes down to him breaking an NDA
---
Sad that I only have one upvote to give.
---
there is a reason why gsm only showed up for the online meeting that were talking about changes where they could make isk. It was talked about before form former csm xenuria did not get voted in agein by gs becuse he was not willing to play ball by gs and they were told not to vote for him and the members that addressed there concern were blacklisted and removed form gs and there alliance.

Mods taking sides? No way!
---
Boasting in an ironic web
---
As far as I know, CCP has only ever referred to Brisc by his in-game name. If this occurred with a hypothetical CSM member whose RL identity was a secret, there could be no potential damage to his real reputation, only to the fake reputation of the character. If banning an account for NDA or EULA violation is grounds for defamation claims even if the account holder's real identity is a secret, then banning bots or any other kind of NDA / EULA violators could conceivably be treated as grounds for a defamation suit. That's absurd. If it's grounds for defamation if the account holder's real identity *is* public knowledge, but without concern for how it became public, then NDA/EULA violators could create a "defamation shield" by simply associating their in-game identities with their real ones. That's also absurd. The only way a situation like this would count as defamation would be if CCP openly used Brisc's real identity to identify him, and even then it would probably only count in the event that they associated his character with his real identity *before* he did.
---
Concerning the ethics of due process, I feel like you mischaracterized my claim, but I could have been clearer, so that might have been my fault. I stated that there is no ethical need for a "due process" in an official capacity. What I meant was a fully documented, public, legally-binding, institutionally and culturally supported set of legal procedures defined as "due process". I didn't intend to claim that any given hypothetical fair system does not ethically require *internal* due process, which it clearly, intrinsically does. It's just that if CCP has proof of a violation of NDA or EULA and chooses to act on that proof without notifying Brisc, or pre-notifying anyone at all, or treating it like some kind of trial, there's no ethical problem there. What would be an ethical problem, is if there had been no internal due process, and they did not have proof or evidence of wrongdoing internally.
---
a shot for open goal.... nah lets give the honest answer..I quit 2ish years ago to focus on RL. Did a lot rl improvements and after last evesterdam I got kinda hyped and figured lets do some pewing again... just not at the same all consuming way I did before

Bye

Source?

I'm pretty sure this is a stupid question so here we go...
---
I'm in a freighter in about ten days. Have been playing Eve on/off since 2006. Have never had a freighter. Ever. An Obelisk I bought at Dodixie awaits.
---
It was fun to play with my friends in a small (less than 30ppl) corp. We had a lot of fun! But I haven't logged on in about 2 years. They moved.
---
*Once I use this freighter to join my friends again, what should I do with it?* Keep going to blockade runner and place goods for sale in lowsec or null hubs?
---
*What is a way to make good isk in any highsec or lowsec areas with a freighter?... Over the mid-to-long term.*
---
Much of my main's 7M SP is in spaceship command, engineering, cloaking, and Gallente ships.
---
Also I have full Plag efficiency with a 4% repro implant. (Where we lived it paid well to mass-buy Plag and repro it for our indy jobs or sell the Mex.)
---
Please tell me the way(s) that this skilling to get a freighter can pay off for me...!?
---
*More biased towards fun vs isk. *My plex isk comes in from moon/PI and market stuff.
---
Damn. Brisc never shared any cool secrets with me and we are friends :(

"I did not have sexual relations with that woman".

What if this is all linked to the extractor then plex market

---
My drones don't wanna go slow they wanna go fast!
---
What am I missing did init lose a big fight or something
---
Got it backwards. We only voted in Xenuria as a sadistic prank against CCP and the community at large. Imagine the collective look on our faces when it turned out he was mostly competent! Couldn't have that.
---
You always look good to me querns
---
Yeah my opinion matters. It is an issue with a COMMUNITY ELECTED group as being part of said community it matters. I don't want anything exact to be honest here. I don't need to know what was leaked and what was bought but I do want to know what they saw. If they release a statement and say something like "After being informed by the remaining CSM members [I would like to have a name here but it will never happen] that confidential information has been leaked we took a look into Brisc's in-game activities aswell as his close affiliates. We found [example here] suspicious market activity and conversations and issued suspensions acordingly" I would be fine. I do not need to know the exact numbers or exact words exchanged. If it wouldn't be a game I would need more exact evidence but this would be enough considering the circumstances.
---
Things that show he has no idea about how the game works (if someone could not guess that from his offline modules and the wisdom to run security missions in a battleship with T1 light drones as the primary damage source)

---
Heh. It's funny to me seeing some of those posts that were down voted to hell were correct.

Perhaps they'll finally become Goons in name instead of just Goons in spirit then
---
Lmao yeah
---
http://www.eeemo.net/
---
Personally that's actually my own assumption. I strongly doubt they'd publish a press release without doing some kind of investigation.
---
I was only pointing out to the OP that the press release isn't "in game" but an IRL life accusation against an IRL person and IF they fucked up and only made a token effort at confirming the truth of what they said *Brian Schoeneman* could have a legitimate cause to bring a defamation lawsuit against them.
---
Yeah, political campaigns are vicious. So even though it was just over a video game, I could easily see someone slamming him with a "This guy can't even be trusted with video game information, you want to trust him with US Government info?" kind of logic. Hope it doesn't, no ones RL career should be affected by space pixel drama.
---
Failed on the substance, not on whether she had standing to file the claim.  
---
It's a perfectly valid analogy.  Brisc's claim could fail on the substance as well, as outsiders we're unable to make a judgment at this point.
---
Which were posted by CCP about 2 weeks ago, not within a few days of the Summit that the spike in coraxes happened.
---

He chose to violate a legally binding document over space pixels, if he's going to make that choice there's no reason it shouldn't be held against him when he works in *real politics*.

We did NOT COLLUDE with the FCs. Sister Bliss tells me there was NO INTERFERENCE, and I see no reason not to believe her. This is just a WITCH HUNT by the Icelandic vikings.

I earn the isk in binges. I dunno... Just not in the "mood" to stare at dscan or go ratting for the thousandth time.
---
I don't have a ton of connections on Eve so when my friends aren't online I just earn iskies.
---
Between sending isk back and forth to the homies, terrorizing small trade hubs with game-legal market manipulations, and moon/PI stuff... Shit I dunno when the last time I ran under 2.5B even was!
---
2.5B or less and I start to worry a bit about isk. Anything I do to earn it is broken down on spreadsheets and I even assume an isk/hr "labour rate" for myself. Some of the most lucrative isk things I've ever done were just beating a 2-4% margin horse until it was well dead lol 
---
Otherwise, tracking it doesn't bother me at all.

if panic, panic first!
---
Hello from the future!
---
grr gon
---
Here's a link to an interview of Brisc today. Some highlights include:
---
"There has been no due process."
---
"It seems a lot of this is circumstantial."
---
"This is very damaging to my personal reputation. To my professional reputation."
---
"This is pretty frustrating. And - uh - I don't know what else to say at this point other than the damage to my reputation has been pretty considerable and I'm going to be looking at all my options."

The best part is their main fcs got banned along with brisk. Git fuckin geypwned nerds

That'll do, thanks!

great job GSM, the perfect escape goat, totally guilty and from an "independent alliance".
---
Literally in the article linked at the top of this post...
---
Whoever planned this headshot of INIT is a genius.
---
You are being dense on purpose (or maybe you are just dumb), I have actually worked in this industry before, I know how and why people get banned for things like RMT. Usually the tools available to GMs show clear cut RMT trails; however, sometimes what looks like RMT is not. 
---
In any case, I used that example as an incredibly simple way to illustrate the above. Or, in other words, *sometimes* innocent people who look guilty on the first pass, turn out not to be. I understand that no MMO company is going to ban anyone for RMT just because one person accuses that person of being engaged in RMT. 
---
If you are a person who gets banned who *is* innocent, it really sucks when the company who owns the game will not even do you the courtesy of telling you *exactly* what you are being banned for. 
---
For example, I know of one incident in an SOE game where someone was banned for racist speech. It turns out, when the issue got escalated to a senior GM, someone had reported someone RPer for saying 'tar em baby!' while RPing a 'court marshal' on SWG. 
---
Because the SOE GMs were very specific about what was reported, what the logs said, and the action taken because of the logs, it was relatively easy for the person to challenge this, and have the logs re-examined more closely, and the ban over turned. 
---
So, since you want to play (or be) dumb and dense, using your logic that person would have just stayed banned, because the GM who banned him told him--you were banned for racism--and the CS team could have called it a day. 
---
What I am saying is because sometimes the investigation gets it wrong, and because this game unlike a lot of other MMOs has people who have been playing it for up to 16 years, I think CCP *ought* to do what I think is the decent thing, and when they are permabanning someone--and only when that person asks via the ticket system--CCP should walk the person who they are banning through the *exact* EULA violation and incident CCP is using to make the decision.
---
Wow, he can't even be a fake politician with integrity. I can't believe that I voted for him.
---
Fairly common behavior on bans from online games. I also wouldn't be surprised if CCP severs all contact with him and refuses to disclose any further information or allow him a chance to defend himself.
---
Realistically, you cannot hang a bee as they can fly; which is why so many eve players find their little sweet piece of happiness in Delve. The freedom to fly high, live out your EVE dreams and be immune to gravity based execution.
---
Its called being a smart politician. The fact that leak got leaked (pun intended) is just plain unlucky
---
Farewell csm....you had a good run. The koreans will handle things from here on out.
---
I don't think we're advocating Briscuit poppin' himself on Talking In Stations or something, are we?
---
It wasn't me
---
Pretty sure OP might be an account belonging to said streamer.
---
At 13:50 abut electronic devices being used in csm meeting.
---
Let step back away form EVE and look at US politics Russians spy's and news, over the past 2 years.
---
ok
---
if  say X recorded it then framed him as a political smear campaign then holly fuck this is starting to go FBI Clinton investigation level shit.
---
You are now the best wormhole CSM congrats!
---
Molok was aquired by using bris leaks CCP should take it.
---
The why was violating a signed NDA.
---
he screams at you because he cares. you make him do it. if you weren't such a terrible pilot, he wouldn't have to yell at you.
---
such an underrated comment..
---
Take your negativity and peace out, be part of the solution and not part of the problem.
---
So, the character goes back to 2009, with regular killmails back from 2014. ALL LOSSMAILS! So here comes this Mach; flashy; he thinks to himself, "self! I have my TI Acolytes, I have my TI hardeners, I'm good to go! Today's my big day!!" 😂
---
The undeserved confidence people have is sometimes ridiculous.
---
Worst wormhole csm. But I'll re-elect you
---
But this is CCP.
---
I come back from hiatus to see what's up in EVE, and I'm greeted to this spiciness. Brisc is uberfucked IRL if people catch wind of this.
---
Or, if he is actually guilty be a decent human being and own up to it.
---
True, but I remember a time when none of the CSM was involved in drama and we had lowsec and wormhole candidates.
---
:c
---
no
---
According to some in an above comment chain he is the most likely suspect for a price movement in the corax prior to the release of the csm notes. Not to mention the 2 others who were banned are both high level fcs in his alliance.
---
You're still paying 2b/month to keep that account alpha until it's at 5m SP. You'll only get it 500k sp earlier, that's not a whole lot. Practically i don't think it'll change much.

It'll either end his career or get him a promotion, White House Press Secretary by next week.

There's a lot of reasons but the main reason is I feel like it's too formulaic and unfortunately I can't just make stuff like Going South happen on command.
---
There's vote fuzzing on reddit. The percent upvoted is not accurate to each person voting. And some people fat finger the downvote on Mobile, downvote because they just don't care about any CSM news, etc.
---
Yup. With the law.
---
I once accidentally became a chef, a head chef. 
---
I'd been quite seriously but not seriously ill for a while and it kinda ruined my life but that's another story for another shit thread. Anyway I started to get my shit together and went back to college studying business administration, it was full time and I still needed money to pay the rent so I got the dream student job helping in a restaurant kitchen where I could get all the free food and drink a student could ever need. I was out at college from 7am to 5pm then straight to work until midnight, I mostly did the cleaning and fetching and carrying and sometimes helping out the second chef so I started to learn his job.
---
When I finished college the restaurant offered me a job as the kitchen porter, I figured I'd do that while I looked for an actual job that wasn't cleaning dishes. I had to help cover for the 2nd chef on his day off so I learnt all the things that he would do and one day he left so I took his job. As 2nd chef I had to cover for the head chef on his day off so I had to learn how to cook everything and basically run the kitchen and then one day he had a big row and quit so I took his job.
---
It was pretty fucking terrifying, there was no one around to teach me anything anymore so I went to the bookstore and there were a whole bunch of people buying celebrity cookbooks and I'm grabbing the Good Housekeeping books which was pretty funny. I handled it though and I never poisoned anyone and rarely received complaints. I really enjoyed it.
---
One day it was pretty busy and I had to get the kitchen porter to help the 2nd chef which meant I was dashing back and forth cleaning my own pans. I'd been shallow frying something and went over to the sink to clean the pan while shouting at someone and checking 8 other things were going to plan, the pan hit the top of the tap and flipped up and spilt boiling oil over the back of my hand. It didn't hurt but I knew it was really bad, I immediately went into shock, they rushed me to hospital, it felt like a sunburn when the skin prickles. At the hospital I had to run my hand under ice cold water forever, it was so cold my bones hurt. They try not to touch burns so they don't cause any more damage so they squirt cream on the burn and then they put a clear bag over my hand, the cream spreads over the burn as you move your hand around. It started to hurt a few hours later, even with the painkillers I would have let you cut my hand off to stop it, I sat on the kitchen floor, with my hand in the freezer, wailing. A couple of days later they removed the bag and bandaged it, my hand was bright pink but there were no blisters.
---
After a week they took the bandage off and told me I was ok and to keep it moisturised. I went back to work and I think it must have got too dry. At 3am I woke up and all of the skin on the back of my hand had split and cracked, over the next couple of weeks it got infected and I had a couple of holes in my hand. It was pretty bad, took a few months to heal properly. It's never been right since then. 
---
I enjoyed being a chef, it's one of those jobs where you find out more about yourself. If you can work in a kitchen then anything else is easy. People always complain to me about how busy they are, they have no idea. I've literally cooked a 4 course meal for 70 people all at once, don't tell me you are busy, htfu.
---
Same, I don't particularly like brisc but damaging someone rl over a game is stupid. This could've been handled a lot better like the decency noobman got
---
Or, and hear me out, we could try not freeing Brisc and enjoy the drama for as long as possible...
---
He did say in that impromptu Talking in Stations that when it was revealed that Pando was the 3rd person that it "is making more sense now" but still denied that he "said anything to break an NDA".
---
Considering that the suggestion from CCP is that electronic equipment was used to pass on the information, he didn't need to say anything. Considering that he also admitted in the Talking in Stations interview that he would communicate with alliance mates in the meetings to get opinions and more expert advice, he could have shared information in good faith for the betterment of the game. He also mentioned that at a previous meeting other members of the CSM were concerned about his conversations with another party during meetings but this was rectified which suggests that there was existing concern that his actions - good faith or otherwise - could be damaging to the integrity of the CSM.
---
TL;DR - Brisc shared information but believed he did it to be better informed and improve the CSM. Others could've taken advantage and, even if he acted in good faith, he still could be punished for breach of NDA.
---
That's an interesting narrative. And even if the ADM thing were true...why is this a bad thing again? 'Keep making isk, but do it here where you have a chance to be saved and hey, it keeps ADMs up'. Seems pretty win-win if I was integrated and invested in the space. 
---
Usually Legacy (non TEST) supers and rorqs die because they didn't actually tell anyone they were tackled, or did so too late. Much like any other alliance / coalition, you'll always have shitters.
---
Very legal and very cool!
---
I don't hope for his career to be ended, but his decision make sure was pretty shit, to link his rl with his character, and the do what he is accused of. If his career is effected by this, he only has himself to blame.
---
Your arguments overwhelm me. I pray to you genius, and undoubtedly unmistakenly greatest person. Reading is for the weak, arguments are for the weak and nice language is for the weak.
---
I thank you that you honored me with your wisdom.
---
This is almost pure fantasy. Where did you read this shit ?
---
&gt;[..] CCP should have at least given you a heads up.
---
Why? 
---
Remove the idiot and move on, he'll see it eventually when he tries to log.
---
RIP Brisc Rubaltitz o7
---
Yeah as much as everyone loves the GSM memes, I do believe the guys who get elected only want the best for the game.
---
I think you're looking at it all the wrong way.
---
If you're a HS mission runner you simply dont understand the PvP in the game. However, they *feel* like they're going to win. Nobody starts a suicide fight they are certain they will lose. It's fascinating that people have so much confidence in themselves in something they so clearly don't understand.
---
He linked his RL to it and then decided hey, let's violate an NDA to get ahead in space pixels. Someone getting doxxed over spaceships is too much, someone's RL getting fucked over not being the most trustworthy ingame is too much, but if you're going to work in politics and choose to violate an NDA over space pixels you really set yourself up to get fucked.

For anyone wondering what the deleted comment was. That didn't age too well I guess...

Wrong.  
---
Any player that creates an account with EVE Online is paying a fee in order to be permitted to have a licence to access the services provided by CCP Games and subsidiaries. That licence is limited in scope and has built in restrictions that you agree on upon paying the monthly fee, one way or another. As such, there is no exchange of physical property. Any and all information that does not include personal data is owned wholly by CCP Games. You retain your rights under privacy legislation, but any game assets, items and information is property of CCP.  
---
Not sure where you get your information.

Hey ex-csm you can quickly make a new char and get into a vni and do good isk again 😀

I have a small peeper

No other player base has the same numbers even if they wanted too.

Only because there are no more people willing to do that job.
---
maybe with a nerf gun
---
It's ok for CCP to fuck over the playerbase, just not anyone else.
---
Wait is he a lawyer, too?
---
Let me get this straight: a real-life lobbyist and politician gets elected to a private company's player management board, is told to sign a NDA knowing full well what it meant, ties is in-game persona to himself in real life, and then knowingly (I assume) breaks said NDA?
---
*slow clap*

"Wait, you didn’t think this was about the CSM did you? Shit, I’m never quitting that. I get a free trip to Iceland and Hedliner licks my taint. This is a fucking dream job compared to that little league shit." -Brisc Rubal

What's the opposite of F, here?
---
CCP Banhammer
---
As they should have been if they were involved in it. 
---
I think the frustrating thing is that we have just enough details to enable speculation, but not enough to know the context of any of this.
---
TEXAS, LAW.
---
seeing as the man himself repeatedly brought "it" out of the game I think its fair to laugh at him losing his job or how garbage of a person they are
---
Just call rudy
---
CCP requires you to run for the CSM under your RL name...
---
I'm struggling to come up with a parable here.
---
Valley of Death? Fountain of Despair? I'll have a drink and ruminate.
---
I love you little doggy
---
First we have to check Texas Law.
---
If he is willing to break an NDA for in-game assets, how can he be trusted to not breach trust in matters where he stands to gain much, much more?
---
He has proven himself to be untrustworthy, and when confronted with it, denies it at face value. He is deceitful and a liar, and does not belong in a role like what he aspires to do with his professional life.
---
Breaking a legally binding in NDA with a company isn't just "over a game". 
---
To you and me Eve online is a game, to CCP Eve online is their literal business.
---
Incursions.
---
Without goons, Brisc would still be in csm. Think about that.
---
&gt;Only a US gov employee could get caught...
---
Apparently not, seeing as he isn't one.
---
This is the saddest part of the scandal to me -- it gives fuel to the idiotic argument in the linked post to get rid of CSM.
---
CCP barely listens to our feedback now, do you really think they'll get *more* responsive if we lose the CSM (which is essentially our lobbying group)? Anyone who thinks they give a fuck about upvoted ideas on reddit should pass me whatever they're smoking.
---
was thinking the same exact thing
---
It's okay, he'll just get fired a month later.
---
Only evidence they need is that NDA with his signature on it.
---
Of course he is considered a public person but don't threaten him in real life is what I am trying to say I guess.
---
Starts going for real at about 7-8minutes in, and Brisc is only there for about the first half and everything after is just speculation.
---
If im not mistaken there was some speculation about the corax market shifting before the csm notes were released about the summit so that may be part of it. Take it with a grain of salt ofc but it sounds like blatant leaks to me.
---
After a brief review of your recent history I have determined you are too edgy for TV. It's not the overt racism, it's how little tact is involved. I found nothing intelligent or of value.
---
You are bad and should feel bad (and undoubtedly do feel bad, given this is a valid use of your time) That being said I hope you get well soon or at least put some passion into whatever you waste your life doing.
---
&gt; You can't legally defame somebody by telling truth.
---
Depends on the jurisdiction. In most common law countries, this is merely a defense. It's not a complete exoneration since there are damages and asymmetrical responses to consider.
---
Even if CCP are correct, Brisc can still sue (depending on Icelandic law) for the manner in which they announced the ban, or allowed it to happen, or allowed it to spread to the media thereby hurting his IRL reputation and job.
---
Another leak!
---
Pirate Lobbyist^TM

There isn't much "fun" stuff to do with a freighter. You'll want to keep it in highsec for sure and besides moving your own stuff, you can jump into the haulers channel and pick up public courier contracts. Just do your research into highsec hauling before you do.
---
&gt; Posted 1 day ago
---
No shit.
---
Yeah, but that is really the issue with the amount of info they put out about this.  It is exactly enough that we can point to little things like the Corax market, but not enough that there is anything concrete to look at.
---
I just wish there was more information, even though it isn't in CCP's best interest (probably) to give it to us.
---
WTF this has nothing to do with Brisc.
---
Get the fuck outta here with your in-game post content.

Yeah there’s literally a PC Gamer article linked in a thread on this very subreddit which succinctly explains who he is. OP is an actual shitpost and maybe a troll. There are like 12 threads on this sub talking about it. This one adds nothing and OP should just read a little.
---
Why not "Former CSM XIII - disgraced"
---
It would imply that wingspan is a wormhole corp.
---
Take your upvote and fuck right off.
---
You are absolutely right.
---
CCP already has a policy, (for whatever that's worth - they're wildly inconsistent about following their own rules), about never ever discussing ban reasons publicly. That they've already publicly announced this ban is extremely unusual given the official process is absolute radio silence.
---
Dang, I think you just out-lawyered the Texas lawyers.
---
#FreeBrisc
---
They should probably explain what he did because apparently he hasn't got the first clue.
---
They did the due process. During that they found Brisc and company guilty, permabanned all of his accounts, 1 year banned his cohorts, stripped him of his CSM responsibilities then proceeded to create a devblog detailing all these actions.  
---
I very much doubt some low level CCP employee just up and banned him with no reason.
---
no u
---
We all know he was ballsdeep “init”
---
Don't mind me
---
Just posting in the best thread of 2019
---
No eve is dying... for the last decade
---
Shines throwing that bit in to beg for sympathy lmfao
---
hey Brisc just thought he was in congress where you can use insider info /S
---
&gt; At first, the law worked like a charm. The number of stock transactions made by congressmen plunged more than 50% from 2011 to 2012. Those who kept trading had to post their trades to a searchable online database.
---
&gt;But then, just a year after the STOCK Act was passed, Congress amended it in a quick procedural vote. Surprise, surprise - it got rid of the online disclosure requirement.
---
&gt;Today, in order to see the inner workings of your representative’s portfolio, you have to go down to the basement of the Cannon House Office Building in Washington, D.C., and ask for a printed file.
---
&gt;Technically, that file in a damp D.C. basement still constitutes a public disclosure. Thus, your congressman’s market-beating transactions are technically not insider trading.
---
He's right, though. Brisc can absolutely launch a defamation case from this incident.
---
I've got to preface this with the whole "I'm not an attorney" disclaimer, but I give it strong odds that Brisc has enough standing to prevent a judge in the US or Iceland from dismissing the case outright. CCP better have strong evidence and good lawyers.
---
I am in favor of this.
---
It’s a truth because you say it is? Since when did we get so much power? Don’t have to provide evidence or anything... we can all just spout what we believe to be true and that’s enough grounds to make it fact. 
---
The CCP article states that he violated NDA, but we are asking on what grounds... you can’t just incriminate people and not provide evidence. This sets a large precedent about the culture and process of CCP.
---
Well, looks like a seat is open up! I propose to legalize space weed and poop socks for everyone!!!!
---
LOL, you're an idiot.
---
Brisc, Shine, and Pando got permabanned.
---
I never suggested they did, I was just acknowledging his claims of innocence/ignorance, and my lack of personal knowledge of the proceedings.
---
I'm about as well informed about Icelandic law as I am about Texas law, but a NDA is a contract, and I'm pretty sure a tort trial is required to determine if you are in breach of contract. As far as I can see, CCP is not trying to go after him as a matter of contract law, they just banned him from game for breach of the rules of the game. So yes, it's funny to say haha to lawyer breached the contract, no where has CCP said they are going after him on the contract. Just for a rules violation.
---
Pando and I **
---
When you are the underdog of eve with only 6.500 characters in alliance, sometimes you feel the need to cheat your way, can't really blame them.
---
The good news is, neow he'll have the opportunity to buy all of the Brisc votes instead.
---
Me too, me too...
---
Read me more papa! Pls!

Nice

Yeah, its a trash move.
---
Typical Vikings.

Ah man, I'm a Virginia resident. This is golden.

So is anybody actually surprised? I thought we all knew this was going on already.

If we get Bluedagger elected you can get pushed back to 5th.

As a fellow streamer i say.

and this is coming from me, (and if you know anything about me, you know i shitfit like no other!)  
---
Get rekt.  
---
Good work man o7
---
Apparently the entire thing was 
---
1. uncovered by his fellow CSM, 
---
2. reported to CCP, 
---
3. investigated by CCP and 
---
4. acted on with bans and asset removals
---
... all without anyone telling poor old Brisc anything at all!
---
Some neat dedication there..... but what the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Until I broke away, it would not enter warp. The nose of the ship was pulling back and forth like a fish on a line. I had to get quite a distance from the structure before it actually warped, so I don't think I was running into it.
---
This is nothing compared to the shitshow that went on here during wwb/cw.
---
&gt;there are no more people
---
this is usually my experience. there are many people, but not enough able to think/do certain stuff efficiently. if he has actual value and his people know it, he will easily weather it. maybe put him to some think tank for a while. and in a year it will be just a joke story
---
&gt; My phone was at 420% when I read this
---
HaHa because weed right? Sweet
---
That would provably be because goons have the most voting power in the game no doubt. No point in voting when the majority of Eve is goons and will vote for goons.
---
Oof. 
---
Worst part is, wasn't he exonerated?
---
so when i read how the faction stuff went up in price after t2 ammo usage got confirmed recently i thought there might be some insider trading going on, and that ccp should be cracking on stuff like that. so who knows if this is related to that or not.
---
so i was now surprised when days after i thought about it, it actually happened and ccp did crack down on some insider info stuff
---
Oof.
---
Sold Him out for 30 Isk.
---
OwO
---
For making a joke? Someone is triggered.
---
Hey man nice shot.
---
Also IIRC that was a total frame job.
---
So, medium autocannons?
---
Yeah, probably from Hedliner and Doomchinchilla
---
Usually when a Mob boss is taken down, its because one of the "generals" testified to reduce their own sentence.
---
Womp wooooomp
---
Some speculation:
---
Given that the two other accounts that got banned were init FCs, it is probably a combination of that and also trying to give init a hand in doctrine development for a future meta shift. My guess was that it concerned the March balance pass or the game time PLEX sale.
---
Tbf they also don't go "hey btw we're investigating you for botting" or "hey we're investigating you for rmt", he's hardly going to get special treatment for being CSM
---
I guess it depends if there was a precedent set. For example, if he could prove that other CSM members communicated with their alliances/core members to ask about certain areas that could have led to monetary gain but didn't, his claim of 'good faith' (if he is making one) could hold water as he is not getting punished for his actions but the actions of others.
---
Similarly, if it is because of his use of real-time interaction in meetings, unless CCP have evidence to show he had been previously warned against these actions or that other CSMs had never talked about discussed issues with those outside of the NDA, Brisc could argue that he is being punished for his method of communication, not the communication itself.
---
In short, if CCP didn't enforce their NDA with others and it's only due to the resulting abuse of his good faith, it might be hard for CCP to enforce now. I'm also not supporting his actions but merely playing Devil's advocate.
---
mmm, balsamic.
---
As it's an NDA thing I doubt we'll ever know!
---
10/10 's
---
I am all CSM on this blessed day.
---
Automated bans, which are *very* different from this situation.
---
drop an /s next time... do you even reddit?
---
If you follow options trading at all you know that insider trading is alive, well, and extremely common.  Also, they almost never get prosecuted.  I have seen numerous multimillion gains that 'just happened' to be 2 hr before huge news.
---
What representation?
---
What operation of law? You mean legal procedure? That doesn't apply to private contracts that have a "fuck off I can kick you off this service any time for any reason"  clause like ccp's eula
---
Awesome (shit)post that's why I love EvE so much
---
CCP, stop with this CSM nonsense and create focused groups within CCP that can be neutral towards all of us and work for a better game.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
yeah i feel bad now that i actually looked it up
---
cold?
---
haha get wrecked.
---
They will never be unbanned.

I hope you guys will be screaming as much as you did about gigx if they make new alts

*BRISC RUBAL WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*

[REDACTED]

According to Brisc in his Talking in Stations interview, members of the CSM had had concerns about conversations he had had with someone in his alliance at previous meetings. He also said that he would talk real-time with alliance mates in CSM meetings to get opinions and thoughts on areas that he needed more knowledge on. Therefore, the tinfoil is telling me that multiple CSM members went to CCP when this didn't stop and they then spotted that some of the people he'd been talking to used the information he'd given in good faith to make bank.

They have to ban 1st in order to freeze assets, isk, plex, etc. Otherwise by the time they actually ban everything would already be stripped and skill injectors liquidated on proxy accounts with new skill injectors ready to go plus plex.

His claims of ignorance are irrelevant. He was banned for breaking NDA. Good on CCP for taking appropriate actions to get rid of an CSM that profiteered off confidential information. Eve's economy is already upside down, Brisc Rubal and his 2 partners are tumors that deserved to be removed.
---
&gt;This was not particularly smart.
---
That was pretty much the first thing I though of when I saw this pop up. The guy's career was basically never doing what he just got caught doing, and its not like it will be hard for people to find out it happened because of how closely he tied hie working life to the game.

No. 
---
What it is that an NDA violation will affect his personal job. If, and only if it gets to a court, CCP may end up settling out of court and drop the NDA violation bit but keep a EULA / TOS violation and the perma ban. if they do not settle out of court, and it actually does end up going in front of a judge or some panel, then CCP will have to present their evidence.
---
that's a generous way to say "everything after is pulled out of their collective ass to pretend they have something to talk zboy about and aren't just a microphone"
---
I know this is an odd concept but some offline towers are just offline to save money but can be put online quickly when needed. It would be impossible for CCP to know what towers are strategic and which ones are abandoned. What most do in these situations is but the highest DPS ship they can field and let it bash afk until its dead. If its offline there is no RF period and you get a KM.
---
There was a recent post on this subreddit titled "This is what _____ looks like".  CSM leaks or something. Could be related to that.
---
&gt;Especially since it can seriously affect your real life job and since it’s likely your first offence.
---
Lawyer here; assuming the allegations are true; it's in the public interest to know which lobbyists are honest and which violate their NDAs. So, yeah, his real life job ought to be affected because his offense relates to honesty and fulfilling promises that he signed for, otherwise all his clients are at risk.
---
This is literally material information to any future or current client he has. Whether this is a "first offense" is a matter of speculation and is only deducible when all such violations are made public. So that's another reason why it ought to be publicly shared and rightly should affect any job that involves NDAs.
---
Remember, his character didn't sign the NDA in the game, the real person behind the character swore not to disclose, using his real name! 
---
This is a serious offense, not merely role playing in the game. So, yes, things you do IRL should affect your real life. That's a no brainier.

Have you ever been in an alliance where you feel so close to the other members that they're like your family? I suspect this was the case, and letting someone that close to you know about some hard times you're running into, especially if it will effect how often and where they see you, I don't see why it would be a surprise at all.
---
I was just stating a fact. Mainly because I know Brisc is reading every single comment and calling him a tumor is fun.
---
&gt; He also said that he would talk real-time with alliance mates in CSM meetings to get opinions and thoughts on areas that he needed more knowledge on.
---
This sounds like a big no-no to me. I'm sure he would claim that he never said anything that would be under NDA, but that's highly suspect. Maybe if he had to talk to people in real time to get knowledge on things he didn't know, he wasn't CSM material in the first place.
---

---
On the other hand would other politicians care what he did in a video game? I mean, if you tell this to anyone not playing games they will probably laugh it off. 
---
Could go either way.
---
He’s a lobbyist not a politician. I’m not making judgments on him personally but... he’s a lobbyist,
---
you might be onto something. normally politicians are just puppets who get their donors write their laws. if he went into it like this and asked back and his alliance people could read through his questions what might happen in future, then he did not broke nda intentionally but they read him
---
so i guess for future we should focus on candidates who know how game mechanics actually work and dont need "help/feedback" from their alliance.

Sounds like a matter for a TEXAS LAW courtroom.
---
They have to accuse a person of something they can prove they did not do.  They banned an in game character and made no mention of that person's real name. Now if that person has made the connection between the character and himself that is beyond CCP's control an not their responsibility.
---
We have the best threads, believe me.
---
Interesting take-aways for me:
---
* When it was revealed that Pando was the 3rd person that it "is making more sense now" but still denied that he "said anything to break an NDA".
---
* He admitted that he would communicate with alliance mates in CSM meetings to get opinions and more expert advice
---
* At a previous meeting other members of the CSM were concerned about his conversations with another party during meetings
---
***TINFOIL INCOMING*** Brisc shared information but believed he did it to be better informed and improve the CSM. Others could've taken advantage and, even if he acted in good faith, he'd still be punished for breach of NDA.
---
However, if he could prove that other CSM members communicated with people not covered by NDA about areas that could have led to monetary gain but didn't, a claim of 'good faith' (if he is making one) could hold water as he is not getting punished for his actions but the actions of those who took advantage of a convention where the NDA would be extended out of goodwill.
---
Similarly, if it's because he spoke to them during meetings electronically, unless CCP can prove he was warned, that there was a specific clause covering electronic communication in CSM meetings in the NDA or that other CSMs had never spoken about redacted areas of meetings with those outside of the NDA, Brisc could argue that he is being punished for the method or timing of communication, not the communication itself which would be shaky ground.
---
**TL;DR - Brisc could get out of this even if he breaches the NDA if CCP haven't enforced their NDA properly before now.**
---
That's not true, we post these things on /r/wallstreetbets all the time.
---
you're thinking of it the wrong way
---
he's saying he had people who were subject matter experts talk to him, and he saved his notes of that conversation, and he used his phone/tablet/laptop to read his notes to ccp
---
expecting every csm to be an expert of everything is not practical and not required. they are conduits for feedback and shields against ccps retarded ideas. 
---
what I described above is exactly how the csm is supposed to work, and just saying "I used my phone for stuff once" is not evidence of anything. 
---
CCP stating they're banning phones at summits, however, is very suggestive
---
I'm assuming the Gila has to be a bit blinged along with the pod? Have any idea what the break even point is for doing level 4s?
---
" without wading well into defamation territory. " If the CSM informed them this happened then they have all the witnesses they need should brisc take that route to prove it happened.
---
all assets acquired by the offence were seized by ccp
---
We joke about space lawyers, but ain't nobody got time for a full legal inquiry. IRL if you get wrongly convicted and you lose your liberty and go to jail. In EVE if you get wrongly convicted then you can't play your game anymore.
---
7/17 is fairly excellent compared to most ideas that get thrown at CCP, only to wind up in the shitheap behind the building.
---
Suck a duck, also upvote because you where right, dont let it get to your head
---
Haha no you're not. They won't let you stay.
---
Whoops. I'll edit my comment.
---
On a scale of ruined to tainted where would you say your reputation is?
---
Its true, CCP actually goes to good lengths to protect player RL identities. Take the vids / photos from last CSM meeting and how they censored one or two of the CSMs in them just as a recent example of this. The RL identity disclosure was entirely on him, not on CCP.
---
This Odelll guy on the forum is going to have a fucking aneurysm if CCP manages to remove him from Brisc's sphincter. Jesus.
---
Was actually just watching going south, its what prompted my question.
---
If you ever do get stuff like that, by all means do share. Even if its say a fight where it escalated from pve drop tp pvp fleet, would be fun to see. Or say, your startios just nuking that one mixed fleet solo. Gives a great POV to peeps who might not have spent much time in w-space, or with that type of an active group.

I want to know what the CSM reported

Go get them Brisc

TL;DR As expected, Olmeca hops happily back up on the cross trolling for all the sympathy that reddit can muster.

Probably close to yours as an alliance leader.
---
Oh no wtf. Did u leak something unintentionally on TIS?
---
If this was truly the case it seems like it would be rather heavy handed to outright ban all the parties without speaking to them first without speaking to the parties ahead of time or warning Brisc that the behavior could compromise the integrity of the CSM.  
---
However, I feel like they may have found some form of "intent" on the behalf of Brisc, otherwise they wouldn't ban him.  At least it is my hope that they wouldn't ban him otherwise.
---
Politicians being politicians
---
is 'no u' really the best you have lmao
---
Words to live by
---
I agree, the CSM can't run in any other way as no-one can be an expert in all areas of EVE as they can't in real life. That's why the previously discussed convention of bringing things to subject matter experts is an NDA breach that has been overlooked by CCP.
---
However, this time it looks like people took advantage of that privileged position instead of sticking to the convention of extending the NDA unto themselves as a gesture of goodwill to CCP and the CSM. To perma-ban Brisc for the actions of others (if this is the case) could lead to problems for CCP as they'd either have to unish everyone or no-one.
---
Having said that, CCP have the right to refuse service to anyone at any time for any reason so...
---
He still broke a legally binding contract, CCP have a right to sue (but probably wont).
---
We got your back bud. Hope all works out. Hope we get our Fc's back too

Honestly. This seems like a very good damage control post. Pretty well written and could persuade people into believing you. The only problem is your reputation previous to this whole situation indicates that you're absolutely the type of person to have done this so good luck in e-sports mate.

i dont really care what you leaked but at least, and you seem pretty innocent... i hope you re honest thought cuz that would be really asshole move, but ccp must have something in their logs that is fishy... they cant just ban your for nothing. u ll gain some respect after all that happened if u go 100% honest

The least they can do is give you some reasons and an opportunity for defense.

It´s not like you have any rights regarding that, it´s a game that CCP owns.

Enjoy your ban.
---
We need to give Brisc a fair shake, not that this subreddit has a history of level headedness and maturity. Whatever evidence CCP has, I hope it’s solid and not just crappy detective work or worse.. an effort by in-game enemies to take Brisc down.
---
I hope what you leaked was worth it.
---
the delivery was solid tho
---
I find it rather hard to believe CCP would indiscriminately ban the three of you with no evidence. I liked flying with all three of you, but CCP's authority is pretty clear here.
---
That's a lot of words to say your salty. Your not the first person to cry on reddit about how your innocent and you won't be the last
---
if you're innocent i'm glad you're in a position to get some recourse
---
i know a lot of people who i believe were unfairly banned that just got ignored completely by ccp, and were never given a chance to give their side of an argument
---
that said i have no idea if you are innocent or not, but i truly hope you are so this drama train continues. this whole thing is great entertainment if nothing else
---
This is a good time to remind everyone - keep your personal/professional life separate from Eve Online!!!!!!!!!

That's what I'm saying. If this was truly the case it seems like it would be rather heavy handed to outright ban all the parties without speaking to them first without speaking to the parties ahead of time or warning Brisc that the behavior could compromise the integrity of the CSM.

However, I feel like they may have found some form of "intent" on the behalf of Brisc, otherwise they wouldn't ban him. At least it is my hope that they wouldn't ban him otherwise.

It is since kendarr left him to fend for himself.
---
INIT has actually done something worth talking about in the past 12 months and I think that's why everyone's so salty ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Do you know everything about the game or anyone that does? You can't represent people without finding out from subject specialists what the problems are.
---
However, had he asked "What would happen to X if CCP did Y?" instead of "What are the problems with X?", whilst both could suggest a breach of NDA (as outsiders would know CCP are talking about X), the mention of the action they are planning to take - even if it is in good faith to find out what potential problems could be - would be a more severe breach of the NDA.
---
not sure why you keep using words like "allegations," "charges," and "due process" with regard to the actions taken by a private company according to the terms of their NDA and EULA
---
you aren't owed due process when a service provider revokes your access my guy
---
Don't worry your reputation was already damaged by being a lobbyist.
---
Can  you comment on this bit: " All the illicit assets and ISK gained from this incident have been confiscated."?
---
I want to believe you - based on what I've seen so far you seem like a balanced individual. But can you speak for the other two too? Not so much from a character vouch point of view, but from actually knowing if they acknowledge what they allegedly did?
---
People need to realise, whatever side you sit on, that if CCP have fucked up, then this is detrimental to the community no matter who they did it to.
---
I think most people can agree, especially those who know Pando, Shines, and / or Brisc that this entire thing is completely out of character. You can parp your anti-goon, anti-INIT whatever propaganda all you want but if you're honest you know; this is just wrong.
---
CCP's stance will be to not release any information to us but they sure as hell owe an explanation to these three.
---
Fucking rekt.
---
The good thing is that it's unlike to even cause a blip. Anyone who thinks a lobbying firm of all things would care about what happens in a virtual world is deluded beyond rescue. Brisc will be fine.
---
It's disturbing, though, that people want it so badly to hurt him irl because of their schadenfreude over his in-game alliance. Beyond pathetic.
---
I remember when I was banned and the reaction from the community was similar...
---
Not nice when the shoe is on the other foot EH?

As has been pointed out before, there are certain kinds of defamation which are considered so damaging that it is "defamation per-se" or by its very nature.
---
There are several categories for it, but one o f which is:
---
Indications that a person was involved in behavior incompatible with the proper conduct of his business, trade or profession
---
Violating lawful contracts of discretion would definitely fall into that category.
---
Genuinely curious - what reputation would that be? He's pushed for changes to the game that were unpopular for some, but I can't think of a case where he dealt with things in an underhanded way. I.e. opinion vs subterfuge.
---

Yeah good job, put the blame onto CCP and the community team.
---
After breaching CCP's trust, OUR trust, CCP owes you ***nothing***. Why should they provide you the service of releasing a detailed report? That only allows you to continue your deceitful ways.
---
This is a large decision. Also for CCP. There is not a doubt in my mind that CCP has undertaken a very throughout and detailed analysis on the matter, and is only releasing this because they are ***certain***.
---
As a direct result of that, I, and I assume many others, has *no* reason to trust you.
---
If nothing else, your reaction, and this post itself, seems to be an attempt to redirect the blame onto CCPs community team, and pull the "feel bad for me I'm a victim" card.
---
If this actually ends up being a mistake from CCPs side, then yeah, it really fucking sucks, it truly does, but it's just so so so unlikely.
---
I'll be honest, I personally do not know or care that much about you directly. That being said, I just can't believe Dark Shines or Pando would participate in any of this for multiple reasons and I would REALLY like to see some evidence from CCP side.
---
Yeah because you know everything about him and can pass judgment so easily. pff

On the INN stream he was told who the other person who got banned was and a penny seemed to drop but he didn't say anything further.

Regardless I'm pretty sure CCP wouldn't ban him for a weak reason.
---
So you set an example of confronting petty behavior with petty behavior?
---
&gt;  public figure in the United States, my ethics and reputation are regulated by a code of professional responsibility and statutory law
---
Assuming public figure ethics and reputation in the US have any value to anyone.
---
I don't want to be an ass, but the fact that they banned you and 2 others, dragging other membres of the CSM as the one who brought the evidence, I doubt they have fucked up in this. And it's perfectly fine for them not to drag more information into anyone as more information could still lead to people also speculating on it.
---
Hope we get some clarity soon Brisc, either way.
---
Maybe consider triple the SP a new player get (0sp - 20m SP?or more?) and make those "bonus SP" impossible to extract   
---
the training for a newbro make their progression slow as fuck, their ISK gain aswell i just have 16mSP and i make more than they can farm in a month in less than a week that's a problem if you want them to continue playing after 1 week...
---
CCP obviously had a good enough reason to ban you and the FCs, what makes you think you are special enough to be excluded from breaking the EULA and a legally binding NDA? You being an american lobbyist doesn't make you any more special than the rest of the CSM, or the player-base as a whole.
---
I DID NOT INHALE.
---
So why not say that thats what happend? Info is public so it's nothing that would need to be protected and it is not something other CSM members would notice before CCP does either especialy if CSM members are as closely monitored as some guy further up claimed.
---
Considering he appeared to be reported by the CSM, it's either really weird or just simply what it looks like.

Doesn't strike me as being sufficiently "on point". Close, but no cigar.

Standard political "Turn and burn" tactics.  Straight out of Trump's playbook.  Just take the allegations against you, turn them back at the accuser, and deny deny deny.
---
We must see the FULL Mueller report before we can decide.  I know CCP made their statement clear with the evidence, but WE NEED THAT MUELLER REPORT.  Also, we MUST HAVE the tax returns.

\&gt;  The lack of communication, transparency, and due process...  CCP's opaque community team  
---
This is a vidya game bruh, wtf are you on about.  :brisc shrug emoji:
---
This isn't a judicial process and they owe no one an explanation (which is their long time policy concerning bans, if i recall correctly).
---
isn't that the eve way?
---
If claims are made that a contract was broken, and it wasn't, thats a lawsuit. Doesn't matter about the company, gaming or not.
---
I can't say if you're innocent or not, but I believe, from hearing you talk on various streams/podcasts/discords and seeing your attitude towards the game, that you wouldnt risk that for ISK. I would also say that Shines and Pando probably wouldnt risk INIT. as an alliance for ISK. I hope you get a response with the details and maybe the community can see those, too.
---
as much i i like gon shills getting the ever living shit kicked out of their ingame personas you have a point here. CCPs policies and transperency regarding these issues are a fucking disgrace in general. so if brisc has the leverage to put a dent into CCP in that regard im all for it. everyone benefits.

In the end Brisc and co broke a legally binding NDA, CCP can sue brisc if they so please (they probably wont).

I wish my friends in the real world could understand this game
---
Tip from Elise that might come in handy...
---
https://twitter.com/EliseRandolph/status/1114900273330257921
---
Did you really just call yourself a public figure when you would have otherwise had a colorable claim for defamation if the allegations turn out to be false? Good luck proving actual malice. You should know better......
---
CCP needs more transparency on this.
---
Yes from a banning players from their game point of view they can do anything, but if they are playing the NDA breach card then that is a whole other kettle of fish.
---
Given he is making the claim that his reputation is at stake, and he likely knows some very influential people, I think he could definitely sue CCP, should he want to, for defamation of character.
---
I don't know that he would win, but he could make the argument that CCP saying he broke an NDA could be detrimental to his real-world profession and reputation, and at least force them to reveal their proof through discovery.
---
OK, so I'm CCP and I tell you that I'm going to ban you because of the actions you have taken. What's to stop you from taking all your assets and essentially laundering them to be able to get them back later? Or crashing the market with PLEX? Or stealing everything from your alliance? What then happens if the people impacted find out CCP told them they were going to be banned and warned them?
---
Also, Brisc said CSM members had voiced concerns over another issue. I would suggest that that is a warning even if not delivered directly by CCP.
---
Finally, read your EULA. CCP control the game and can, effectively, ban you for whatever reason whenever they want and not explain why. Most businesses have the right to refuse service, after all.
---
I used to put them on strings as a kid seems like delve

Don't be revolting darling.

They dont...

didnt you smug on stream and here later about shady shit you did?

Unfortunately CCP can’t be compelled to do anything beyond than what they’ve already done. But for the “community “ they’re constantly claiming is so important, it would be great if they triple checked what the incriminating information is.

Havent heard he got sued irl so just perma ban as they can do

You're a lobbyist. Do not act like your role "as an attorney and a public figure in the United States" increases your credibility. Your job is legalized bribery, and as such your integrity is questionable by default. My only regret is I was unaware of you before this occurrence so I could have told you previously and frequently to *get out of my state and/or get fucked.*
---
Defend what? Brisc broke a NDA, I don't think that is defendable.
---
The only possibility here I see is that Brisc's comms were hacked/infiltrated and those doing the hackery found out NDA info.  I mean the "confiscated assets" is kind-of suspect.
---
But I'm speculating in Brisc's defence.
---
I've just never come across it outside of LoL. I googled it and now I am wiser
---
Get wrecked retard
---
You kidding? He is probably going to get more job offers than he has ever had before. I mean a lobbyist is essentially glorified corruption anyway.
---
It's very much in CCP's interest to give a reason.
---
Yeah, I'm seriously curious as to whether this will be contested in court. Because after this statement, *not* contesting is pretty much an admission that you do not have a case, isn't it?
---
 As an attorney 
---
so we are supposed to believe you now? :thonking:
---
He is a lawyer himself, so there's that.
---
Ok, what exactly are you trying to do? I feel like all.you did was summarize the start of the game. Essentially a rephrasing of the lore of the eve gate.
---
Nobody cares about your out of game reputation.
---
The only person who ever made anything about that was you.
---
You used your real life credentials to get into an exclusive club and then fucked it up.
---
Even now, you're grandstanding. This thread: a grand stand.
---
Go ahead and keep tying this to your career. See how far that gets you. The best thing you can do right now for your precious career, if that's what you're really concerned about, is to
---
1) stop posting
---
2) make a new account, I hear they get more SP now with referral codes! neat!
---
The non-liberal in me hopes you get justice if you're innocent. However, if you're guilty, please delete. Eve doesn't need anymore cheaters.
---
That wasn't very public spirited.
---
This is mental we have propper Lawyer lawyering up, hope your exhonerated Brisc. Inits currently giving birth to sextuplets babies everywhere. This could actually upset the galactic balance, especially if init decides to join the dark side. Nothing hurts an alliance more than a betrayel especially from ones own CSM members. " To be fully transparent, this misconduct was brought to us by the CSM themselves as an immediate threat to the integrity of the CSM as an institution" I'll just leave that snippet here.
---
I dont know if I have his back, leaving init to distance myself from this type of game-play
---
whats a shitty thing?
---
Its like a dream come true?
---
If they make it that long they might have a chance of lasting long enough for the 1 year banns to end. Assuming the two of them want to return. It's not like Brisc's loss will really hurt init functionally anywhere on the same scale as the loss of their strat FCs.
---
We're friends and he didnt share any juicy shit with me. So that leads me to think this is a bunch of bull.
---
I won't be doing anything to bypass this ban. I have appealed to CCP who will hopefully come to their senses.
---
That's a big if. I see no reason why all of a sudden, out of nowhere, CCP would do something like this, completely unfounded. Yes CCP fcks a lot, but not in this sense.
---
I didn’t leak anything. The only thing I can think of was my brother was using the computer and was playing on my account earlier. I don’t know if he did anything but I’ve always been honest please unban me it’s a mistake.
---
Rumour has it that one of the dudes got told about the titan / FAX nerf and sold his Faction titan.. before it was publicly announced.
---
(( That thought does not make much sense to me )).
---
thatsthejoke.jpg
---
They never done so and they never will
---
Jannie out
---
&gt;It’s a truth because you say it is? Since when did we get so much power?
---
Did you miss the part where CCP banned him when the CSM informed them this happened? Did you really think they didn't require some kind of proof before taking action?
---
Probably more exciting too
---
As much as a hate ccp sometimes, i doubt they just ban 3 ppl (one of them a csm) without a reason. I mean, the fact that they banned 2more aside from brisc proofes that they looked into it and obviously found something..
---
How dare he write out a thoughtful response.
---
Why isn't this post just a meme?
---
&gt;" As an attorney and a public figure in the United States, my ethics and reputation are regulated by a code of professional responsibility and statutory law, unlike CCP's opaque community team. "  
---
Fuck you with a Chainsaw pal.
---
I think CCP opened a can of worms they might not be ready for.  This damages Brisc irl.  If Brisc litigates this CCP will be forced to show evidence that he violated the NDA ( a IRL legal document).   If they cannot show evidence sufficient enough then Brisc finds himself in the position to recoup losses.
---
YOU CANT QUIT! YOU'RE FIRED
---
Bye Felicia
---
ps. can I have ur stu- o wait never mind LOL
---
This is not technically true.  *TEXAS LAW ACTIVATE*
---
In the United States a private business cannot slander or defame a public figure.  They do not have immunity to execute free speech when that speech is harmful to an individual directly.  The media has a somewhat loose exemption here, unless the media agency acted with malice to damage or injure. CCP does not function in the capacity as a news agency, and it's postings and blogs cannot be construed to be news.  Therefore, CCP is not free from recourse from the player, especially with articles in the press covering this story with a clearly one-sided investigation that, according to the player, slanders the player individually.
---
Unless there is still a functional part of CCP in the United States which the player can file a lawsuit though, the jurisdiction for this becomes a bit dicey.  One could argue the jurisdiction is where the offense occurred or where the injured occurred (Maryland/DC area, US Federal Court), or one could argue that the injury occurred at the location of the original posting (which would be England or Iceland).  
---
I for one would be glad to see a lawsuit of this nature actually happen, because while the Terms and Service and End User License Agreement state they can refuse the right to service, nothing in those documents permits or grants CCP the authority to post disparaging comments about the person accepting the terms.  
---
CCP should have just stated that due to some unexpected communications and activities detected within the game, they were removing Brisc Rubal from the CSM.  However, the hamfisted blog post they published is very damning, and speaks directly to the individual's credibility.  It's a smear, plain and simple, unless they present all of the evidence.
---
I summarized it for those that haven't played the game (or know the lore), but it's a story I wrote that deals with rogue drones.
---
He knows that, he's appealing to the masses and pvp themselves since anyone in this position would want to be afforded due process.  He's a dick, but we dont know shit about this.  Likely never will.
---
Saying someone did something and providing the evidence for that shouldn't be an issue I would have thought; if not to the public, at least to the guy who is accused.
---
well, the Falcon Heavy exists, so it's got that going for it.
---
I strongly urge CCP to review this to a much higher standard. This seems short-sighted in terms of investigations and external affairs. All three banned parties have no idea what they did, what information was acted on, or really what they were banned for. Brisc's reputation speaks for itself, he is an outstanding member of the community in every respect who has been a great contributor to the CSM and the greater community through his engagement. Between the individuals banned and the community, we all deserve answers far beyond what was given.
---
He won't. LUL
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41ENCM70xr0
---
&gt; obviously found something..
---
Sounds more to me like they were fed something.
---
So why did CCP make a "Public" Dev Post about it... If not to be asked why did Brisc and the others get banned...
---
I hope people realize that this is is the type of post you **upvote** regardless of if you like him or not.
---
yo Brisc post feet
---
Pretty obvious it wouldn't be about the account, but his personal reputation. PCG already has an article up gaining views by the minute.
---
Wait a minute he's account sharing too... burn him at the stake
---
My sides are in fucking orbit
---
post brisc feet
---
that's even more funny as this normally happens when he jumps his tengu in 
---
[oof](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72842508/)
---
[double oof](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72842514/)
---
Probably not, he's likely still under the NDA, but also can't log in to check.
---
I never implied that CCP doesn't have the right to ban whoever they want for whatever the reason, I only said that if they do so, it would seem "heavy handed".  That's their prerogative if they want to be seen as that type of community manager, however it usually doesn't appear favorable by consumers, especially if there isn't malicious intent.
---
I don't know the details, however, if the situation is as you described it, I stand by the fact that it would be heavy handed, but I have a feeling there is more to the story.  They could have frozen his accounts and the other two while they conduct their inquiry without releasing a press-release saying everyone is banned.  Which is why I believe there had to be more evidence of something malicious than what you just posted, because otherwise it would leave a lot of people scratching their heads.
---
Caldari state, not caldari navy
---
It's the top comment you fucking moron.
---
# #FREE HAT
---
CCP owe Brisc and co nothing, they know what they did, broke CCPs trust, and CCP wouldn't just ban a high profile CSM member based off of inconclusive evidence. In the past CCP has never explained reasons for these bans and for a good reason, the information is likely still under NDA, plus there is no obligation to do so.
---
"NO COLLUSION" doesn't work here bub, best pack it up
---
So, basically, handled just the way any internal affairs/infosec division handles things in a reasonable company - get info, investigate, act on results, then maybe ask questions.
---
Good luck on the appeal usually ccp doesnt do appeals but good luck in trying. And if not enjoy winning eve for a year
---

Ah, thanks! Fixed.

CCP should just make posts here everytime someone is banned with proof so no one like everyone who broke the rules can claim the didn't do nuffin.

He wasn't forced to link his IRL career to his IG persona. The announcement from CCP specifically does not mention his real name, simply referring to him as Brisc Rubal.   
---
He made the choice to link them. Now that he is banned he will face repercussions from that very public connection.

This. if you know Pando. he doesnt care about isk. assuming these dank leaks are ways to make money in game. the dude has been using the same shit fit bridge titan for years. he doesnt even have a kill mark on it. #hatescapitals
---
When it comes to legal stuff like this CCP has always been very thorough. When it comes to NDA breaks, I have no doubt their lawyers are involved and they wouldn't let CCP do something like this unless they believed they had substantial evidence proving it. It doesn't make sense for them to shoot from the hip and ban before asking any questions for something this high profile and possibly legal related.
---
u/jintaan could tell you, but then he'd have to kill you
---
I hope this helps provide some direction with the rogue drone story.

---
If the dude leaked NDA information, do you think CCP talking about the information he leaked is wise?
---
another day and we'll bait ccp into breaking their own nda
---
&gt; I will fight these false allegations, restore my reputation and seek all avenues for recourse available to me for these reckless actions. 
---
They have no obligation to disclose anything to you. In fact, they may and probably do have legal obligations to keep the identities of those who provided evidence fully confidential. The accuser is CCP, not players who have provided evidence, especially if CCP reached out to them in order to obtain the said evidence.
---
Remember, it was you, not them, that made the decision to go full public with your identity, in a game which has a history of such various incidents spilling out to peoples lives. On my personal level, I take extra steps and extra precautions not to reveal my ingame or life identities, right down to not even connecting to anything Eve related without a good VPN. CCP actually takes more then reasonable measures and simple due diligence to protect life identities of its players and has recent history and precedence of doing so.
---
I understand your position. What happened is screwed up. If I were you, I would at least try to get the NDA violation bit dropped and downgrade it to a EULA / TOS violation and take the ban, since that would at least resolve any further RL issues coming out of this and confine it pretty much to the game.
---
Alternatively, if your feelings on the matter are that strong, then file a suit as soon as you can for libel / slander. But beware, then the evidence they have will come into play and you might end up in a far worse position then you are now. It might be prudent to start a suit just to settle for a drop of the NDA if they won't do it themselves without it.
---
TL;DR: So frustrated, that this is so frustratingly frustrating to me amidst all this frustration. I am frustrated!
---
They did, leaking info from the CSM. That is all that is needed.
---
God I still love that song

I'm torn, on the one hand you're still doing embarassing politician roleplay, but on the other hand at least its narrowed down to either Nixon or Bill

Also, Brisc says so and Brisc can never lie
---
He is free to take them to court for defamation and have a judge review the case (hint: he won't because he did it)
---
\#freestunt
---
I would like to ask a few honest questions that come from a position of neutrality. I am not trying to catch anyone out but it might help clarify areas:
---
* Most people understand that CSM members cannot be experts in all areas in the game and, on Talking In Stations, you mentioned that you did have some people in your alliance that you used as experts in certain fields for feedback (I paraphrase so acknowledge that this might not be truly representative of what happened). Were either of the people banned subject matter specialists that you mentioned you communicated with during and/or about issues that had arisen in CSM meetings?
---
* Why was it 'starting to make more sense' when you found out the 3rd person who was banned? Was it related to the issue that had been raised to you previously by CSM members that you mentioned in the Talking in Stations interview?
---
* When CSM members talk to subject specialists, naturally some could glean information about what CCP are discussing. Could someone have taken anything you discussed in good faith for the betterment of the game and breached the convention that the NDA gets extended to them as goodwill to CCP?
---
* Were you the only CSM member to communicate electronically with people outside of the room in meetings?
---
No brisc, you're not special. You got yourself and two others banned for breaking an NDA and CCP is not obliged to tell us any more. Just cause you are a politician and those two are FCs doesn't mean shit, your case shouldn't be an exception.
---
[Meme King has been crowned](http://prntscr.com/n9b4z9)
---
Did we expect anything else from a GOP
---
I’d really like to believe you,  but you get banned right with two more of your own alliance? There is something fishy here. 
---
Hope you can g et your situation fixed, but doubt CCP just banned 3 dudes of the sane alliance without some nice proof.
---
usually team security doesn't do appeals and peligro has a tendency to be a large dick
---
the rest of ccp, not sure
---
ya but the same CCP your praising about still came out with Citadels. When all of the CSM at that time said it was a bad idea..and yet HERE WE ARE
---
&gt; expecting every csm to be an expert of everything is not practical and not required.
---
I don't expect CSM members to be experts in everything, but I do expect them to be an expert in *something*.
---
I don't expect Steve Ronuken to be an expert in Wormhole Mechanics, but I do expect him to have a grasp on how using ESI works, for instance.
---
Brisc brought nothing to the table himself. If he's contacting others to help him understand how the game works, then why don't we just have them on CSM instead?
---
What? you think CCP didn't investigate a breach of a legally binding NDA with care? This isn't just some dumb krab who looks a bit like a bot.
---
inb4 he was "drunk on comms and spat it out"
---
"but it seems nothing like them" -Literally everyone who comes here unable to accept that someone did wrongthink
---
CCP don't owe them shit lmfao
---
depends on how much it damages him.
---
&gt;Brisc Rubal has been removed from his role as a CSM 13 representative effective immediately and will not be able to run in any future CSM elections.
---
&gt;Two other players involved in this incident have received a one-year ban.
---
&gt;All the illicit assets and ISK gained from this incident have been confiscated
---
  Holy shit, CCP isn't fucking around
---
I'm not saying he could win or get unbanned, just that he could force CCP to publish the proof that caused the ban.
---
CCP would have a very hard time convincing a judge that this information could be detrimental to the company if released.
---
I doubt ccp would just blindly believe someone that just "said" something and ban 3 guys because of that.
---
Thoughtful response? It's standard political bullshit of I did nuffin look away.
---
Thanks!
---
'if not to the public, at least to the guy who is accused.'
---
&gt; It doesn't make sense for them to shoot from the hip and ban before asking any questions for something this high profile and possibly legal related.
---
Absolutely, I agree. There's got to be more to this and some discussion amongst the involved parties should clear things up. I'm not saying the rest of Eve needs to know anything, but this whole thing stinks to hell and there's a misunderstanding or a break in communication somewhere down the line.
---
I mean, abkiller that faction titan been up for sale for several months... Way before latest summit
---
No smoke without fire!
---
I mean that doesnt make any sense to me. Even with the nerfs, why would you sell a faction titan? Its not like people would solo roam in them. The whole situation currently just seems wrong. The problem is, as long as CCP doesnt give out any more information to this topic noone knows what really happened.
---
Of course, a high-ranking CO2 member would NEVER do something that could get them permbanned.
---
For the record, I support Brisc's ban, so pls respond with something other than "grr gon brigaders"
---
KATAMARI DAMACI!!!!!
---
Not necessarily, this seems like big news to us but is really just in our little corner of the internet. If Brisc were to bring this to court that would bring far more attention to it, that even if he wins could be negative for his career, and absolutely be worse if he looses. It would probably be beneficial for him either way to just deny and try to sweep it under the rug.
---
Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but I have to point out one thing here. The fact that you're a public figure means absolutely jack shit here. That's on you, you chose to be public in EVE with your IRL status.
---
Yeah cause TheGigx was so very incognito. That's why he was around for months before getting another ban.
---
So he can just spread it again? Brisc broke the trust, giving him any information of the specifics of the ban its not a wise idea.
---
This isn't court. There are no allegations. Judgement has-been made. He was banned for violating his NDA. 
---
There is no maybe about it.
---
Brisc and Pando and Shines? Yeah, no. Something not right with this.
---
Unless they decide to sue they don't need to tell anyone anything, so far to our knowledge it's just been a permban which they could give out for breathing
---
Lots of things are in their interest, they've done pretty much none of them
---
i like this post
---
i'm torn
---
on the one hand, i kind of want to see ccp's ridiculously opaque ban process torn open, and i don't like it when people just get banned for seemingly no reason
---
but on the other hand brisc is an actual dickweed and i'm actually kinda happy he's banned. shines and pando are enthusiastic content creators and every time eve loses one of those it gets a bit worse so i'm not over the moon that they're gone, but honestly i won't shed too many tears if ccp comes forward with evidence and the status quo stands
---
it is a bit relieving that they're not being annoying jackasses with stuka fleets reffing our jump bridges for the moment

Or over in more civilized and reasonable places, a corrupt ass lobbyist (I just said the same thing three times, did I just summon him?) turns out to be a corrupt ass lobbyist in the most corrupt ass game in the world. 
---
Or you know, *someone* somehow managed to do the following: 
---
Fabricate evidence of such massively convincing nature that CCP, renowned for being timid as fuck when it comes to deploying bans for *anything*, bans three high-level folk in the spergiest fucking bloc Eve has ever seen, while claiming one of them *broke an NDA* and opening themselves to a potential defamation suit.
---
Someone apparently have such a massive fucking hateboner for Briscuit boy here, and INIT, that they *somehow* manage to fabricate such evidence and get it to CCP, and for CCP to react with pretty much as hardcore a response as they can to it. 
---
I wonder who is doing this, why they're doing it, and exactly how the fuck they did it, because I've played Eve for well over a decade now and I am struggling to even begin imagining the chain of events that'd culminate in this kind of CCP response. The level of competence required doesn't seem to match the reality of Eve's armies of spergy basement dwellers.
---
... except, you know, the *reasonable* view that Briscuit here done fucked up and took Init's two main FCs down with him, the fuckin' mongoloid. 
---
Yeah, I think I'm going with that. A failed US rightwing politician turned corruption courier... sorry, "lobbyist"... being a failure in Eve too doesn't exactly stretch the imagination much.
---
I can understand and respect your viewpoint. I find it hard to see why someone would risk their reputation and job IRL to gain a few spacebucks beyond "People be stupid, yo".
---
I can see someone else who has less to lose taking advantage of a situation that I described and not thinking about the impact it could have on others. I can also see how CCP would have to treat all parties involved as if it was malicious and then roll-back any heavy-handedness afterwards if needed.
---
They reveal it to the public, the info the NDA was there to keep AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC to begin with is public. They tell brisc privately, he comes back to attention whore about how he was "told nothing". So why not just reveal nothing and skip all that effort
---
Nah I run then everyday in just t2 fit with faction extenders, raging gammas, with skills and gamma bonus it's 180 hps
---
Works on desktop, it was leading to a 404 page on mobile when I posted earlier. No idea :shrug:
---
Its not like he showed being an attorney and public figure in the united states during his promotion video for CSM. everyone knows who he is in real life or can find it out in just a few clicks.
---
What makes you think there's a misunderstanding apart from what Brisc is saying? The same thing has happened to every previous CSM that has broken their NDA.
---
I remember watching footage of the summit, and Brisc had a laptop... :thinking:
---
&gt; It's not like Brisc's loss will really hurt init functionally anywhere on the same scale as the loss of their strat FCs.
---
shines and pando are the only two stratop fcs in the alliance. some rando i've never heard of before was running a 50 man stuka fleet hitting low power structures in caldari lowsec this evening, probably as a "look, we're totally not dead you guys" gesture and it was honestly pretty sad
---
if they don't get shines and pando back, that alliance is headed for some hard fucking times
---
Nothing better then fights about something that matters, bring it on! :)
---
It wasn't top comment when he wrote that, moron.
---
Werent most the csm members goons?🤔
---
He linked his online personal to his real life persona. He did it to the obvious benefit of his campaign. He fucked himself over.
---
I never said CCP owes them anything, nor did I say they are obligated to do anything.
---
All I said was that their response may be "heavy handed" if there is more to the story. I don't know all the facts, nor details, but I'm a pretty big proponent of "Spirit of the law" over "Letter of the law"
---
Assuming public figures in the US share the ethics of the people they try to get attention from
---
Seems crazy that CCP would permaban a CSM, with collateral damage that maybe headshots an alliance, and issue a press release about it, without giving any information to the banned parties. Regardless of what you think of the guy that seems incredibly unfair.
---
It leads me to think that he has been lying about your friendship :thinking:
---
Cool you just keep denying reality
---
Maybe your not good enough friends lmao
---
It makes no sense to me either.
---
"I may have leaked info but it was harmless!"
---
Apparently, its needed.
---
Here is why CCP should be absolutely transparent for shit like this:
---
1.  If someone wants to trade on their personal reputation the last thing they should get is the ability to hide behind a lack of transparency to maintain their innocence.
---
2. If someone's personal/professional reputation can actually get hurt by this then they deserve to see just what it is that got the coffin lid nailed shut on them.  Even someone who is apart of the swamp deserves better than "Viking Law" if they are going to be embarrassed and have their reputation damaged.
---
3. It doesn't hurt for the "community" to know that the company responsible for their entertainment is functioning as intended.
---
That is called living the meme... wanna buy some isk m8?
---
This isn't court they don't have to show shit and he knows it and you know it when you accepted the eula and tos when signing up to play eve.
---
We should support all those other people who complain about being falsely banned here  since ccp hasn't shown evidence in their case that they broke the rules.
---
Release the full report!  We also want to see your taxes!
---
&gt;I like the guy so this ban is obviously a mistake
---
flawless logic
---
Damn, I just noticed it.
---
Posting so I can say #IWasThere
---
Brisk can mean cold or short in duration. "I went for a brisk walk."
---
Just a prank bro!
---
This definitely needed to be its own post and not a comment on the dozens of other Brisc posts...
---
Which is why I don't really believe it.
---
As a new resident of Texas, but not one anticipating the needs for legal counsel. I’m not sure if I would want an attorney that plays eve (and is on the csm). 
---
On one hand I know he would be ruthless and just in it for the money (mine and his %.)
---
On the other hand I would know he is an eve player. So he is probably a moron...
---
I really somewhat torn.
---
who are you kidding brisc will never stop posting even if the permaban stands
---
&gt;I dont think the lobbyist would do this so the ban was obviously a mistake
---
Agreed about the response to the investigation, I guess the heavy handed part is "banned permanently" and "press release" before the guilty parties even get interviewed.
---
I'm sure CCP Dopamine cleared it through his superiors before posting anything, which leads me to believe this is just the way CCP does business.  Their business, their rules.

Thats not the issue. The issue is that in a claim for defamation (which would be a colorable claim in the US if the allegations turn out to be false), one has to prove that the defamatory statements were made at least negligently. The standard to prove defamation against a "public figure" is different, and much higher. A "public figure" needs to show that the statement was made with actual malice, which is significantly harder to prove, and theres almost no way hes ever going to be able to show that. Basically, he would have had a decent case against CCP if the allegations made against him weren't true, but now he shot himself in the foot by admitting that hes a "public figure".
---
Here we go with the sock puppets.
---
Except the only reason this damages him irl is because he came out and said so not ccp. That's what we sane people call being a dumb-dumb and there is a reason 99% of people play eve without dragging real life into it.
---
 I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. *Get busy leaking* or get busy dying.
---
lit wasn't.  kbye
---
This needs to be stickied. ;)
---
B274s and n110s are parts of wormholes!
---
Too late too sell popcorn, I guess?
---
Also, you know someone meant for business when they use the word "opacity"
---
This is the same as any other NDA leak. CCP has no obligation to tell you anything, especially when the info is about NDA material.
---
We have no idea what kind of investigation went into this, it could have been over months. So why do you assume it was short-sighted and a mistake?
---
I hear he hired Fedos to pee on a bed in a room in a Minmatar station that Mittens once stayed in.
---
That’s not how this works. To use an example from another thread, if I post something false about Stormy Daniels, it doesn’t matter that I never link Stormy Daniels to Stephanie Clifford. It’s public knowledge that they are the same person.
---
Cant dock all faction titans if you don't have one bruh
---
Its his own fault for linking his RL name with his ingame name.
---
Everyone knows you did it, I don't have the time or patience to argue this fact... my question is why did the other csm members who are also doing it feel the need to throw you under the bus?
---
like I said ... makes no sense to me.
---
Then owning a faction titan over an AT ship makes no sense to me.
---
However, I am loving this drama more than anything.
---
Oh hey this aged well.
---
Any regrets on tying your real life identity to your EVE persona?
---
Technically...he didn't say it was a good one.
---
no shit

C4 wh with c4/C5 static. Was running in one of my C4 statics last night that had like 40 sites in the hole. Ran about 12 Frontier barracks sites in 3 hours. Only ever had one explorer come into the hole that whole time.
---
Its not like he has suddenly forgotten all the CSM privileged information hes been told lol. If he wants to go down that path and spread protected information then he could quite easily. I'm just saying being given a reason isn't too much to ask is it? Imagine you get charged for murder but they don't tell you who was murdered, where, when, how; they just say you did it - same principle.
---
I hear you my nigger.
---
Brisc is an expert at lobbying and how to make people do what his clients want - his clients in this case being the player base. That, in itself, is just as important as knowing about the mechanics of the game in my opinion but that opens up a different conversation about politics in general.
---
Beyond all of that, though, surely though the only thing that makes someone "CSM material" is that they get elected by the players?
---
Actually I wouldn't really call this in game. Had it been just in game, it would have been more acceptable, since all that dark scheming, scamming etc is accepted there. When he made the connection to real life by breaking a REAL LIFE contract (NDA) even his fellow coalition members said fuck that.
---
The majority of EVE is not Goons.
---
what no one seems to be talking about the the "mabye" recording in the csm meeting in Iceland. I f this happend it goes beyond "in game"  and starts effecting lives within American "PC and News"
---
So, realtalk. I have no dog in this race, am not a member of any alliance allied with or against goons, and have no particular pre-existing opinion about you as a person or an in-game figure. So please understand that it is my honest unbiased reaction when I ask - do you *really* think this statement is a good way to respond? I mean, seriously? Do you even have any *idea* how bad this sounds?
---
First off, why on *earth* would you think that reminding everyone that you are a lawyer, a lobbyist, and a *politician* (!) is a good idea? You couldn't have picked three professions better suited to make you sound utterly and completely untrustworthy if you'd *tried.* I mean, boasting of your positions in *the united states government* as evidence of your *trustworthiness?!?* Pardon me while I (and the other 99% of the population) laugh my fucking ass off. You could be as pure as the driven snow and I wouldn't trust you to organize a drinking party in a distillery after hearing that.
---
Second, do you know any way to talk other than in politician-ese? Because if you filed off a few key identifying phrases, this would be indistinguishable from any one of thousands of 'sleazeball politician denying a scandal' statements throughout recent history. Bluntly, you not only *brag* of being a politician, you *sound* like one, and we've all heard this song and dance innumerable times before. And compounding that by coming out swinging and attacking CCP's conduct simply *reeks* of the worst kind of political shit-slinging. If you want to convince people you're on the up-and-up, you *really* shouldn't imitate the patterns of speech - and more importantly, the *propaganda tactics* - of the single least trustworthy profession in the history of humanity.
---
Seriously. All you needed to say was your first paragraph (minus the passive-aggressive snipe at CCP) and follow that up by saying you were confident that this is a mistake that will be corrected. The entire rest of your statement is completely unnecessary and just makes you look like a guilty sleazeball politician attempting to deflect attention from the scandal of the day. Frankly, reading this not only makes me more likely to believe your guilt simply due to your associating yourself with such thoroughly untrustworthy company, but also due to how incredibly out of touch with reality it makes you look that you think this actually was a good idea.
---
Glugging the Kool-aid I see, how does it taste?
---
i´m pretty sure eve online wrecked plenty of rl careers just by existing.
---
Never said the ban was a mistake. Just that I'm not really seeing Brisc/Shines/Pando doing something this stupid for any amount of ISK.
---
here's why they shouldn't :
---
1) lawsuits 
---
2) lawsuits 
---
3) lawsuits
---
I actuslly can't see how either of them could be associated with profiting off what could have been leaked since Pando is poor af and shines don't make isk rn abd it don't really fit their characters. Id expect this of aryth and random money makers not fcs and it annoys me everytjme another fc is taken outta the game over bullshit
---
Cool would love to try that, but I dont think i have the patience to learn all the wh mechanics.
---
Unblunt the Stunt
---
Anf you think ccps legal team and probably Pearl Abyss there legal team didnt take that into account. 
---
Jeez Manny they have lawyers on staff they dont do this as lightly as some are trying to paint it.
---
Whoops, sorry for being an asshole
---
This cannot be understated at all.  It is absolutely his fault for connecting his real life to his in game life.  Still, given that circumstance, you'd think CCP would have approached this more delicately.
---
Almost forgot how shitty this community was.
---
There have been several people removed from the CSM and for this exact reason. The fact I can't even remember them shows how unimportant it is in the long run.
---

Any behavior or actions considered being a material breach of the EULA, TOS or NDA by a CSM delegate
---
is grounds for immediate dismissal and permanent exclusion from all pending and future participation in

the council, as well as potential legal action depending on the severity of the breach. There are no
---
exceptions or “first strikes” regardless of the infraction. Delegates are not only expected to uphold the

social contract that all society members are held accountable to, but should also set a behavior standard

Whats that mean? CCP can ban Brisc Rubal for any reason they deem fit. Brisc CHOSE to link his ingame and IRL personas, not CCP. With that comes this shit fest.
---
eve players would never lie
---
lobbyists would never lie

republicans would never lie

therefore brisc would never lie right

Unless they were hammering the delete key on stuff, no. Not even close. This is actually pretty boring.
---
&gt; Beyond all of that, though, surely though the only thing that makes someone "CSM material" is that they get elected by the players?
---
Vince got elected by the players, and that didn't really work out, did it?
---
Exactly this.
---
How does his action of linking his RL and in game persona's change the potential damage of CCP's claim? Hypothetically, he never went public but instead got doxxed at some point, does this fact change whether or not CCP's claim is damaging to his reputation? No, it doesn't.    
---
I want to know about what he did and the proof used to reach the decision like everyone else here.   
---
But I also agree with the opinion saying CCP's claims that he broke an NDA is damaging to his RL reputation.
---
&gt;I think CCP opened a can of worms they might not be ready for.  This damages Brisc irl.  If Brisc litigates this CCP will be forced to show evidence that he violated the NDA ( a IRL legal document).   If they cannot show evidence sufficient enough then Brisc finds himself in the position to recoup losses.
---
Its not so clear cut and dry as you make it out to be. CCP did not disclose his RL identity. That was 100% his choice in a game / hobby that has a history of affecting people IRL. This was purely his decision and 100% purely his negligince even without any evidence or evidence not holding up, the RL damages can not be attributed to CCP. CCP banned and disclosed info only about his character and has a proven even recent history of taking serious measures to protect players identities.
---
And on the flipside, if Brisc files a suit for libel / slander and theevidence does hold out, then they may counter sue at least for legal costs and then he'll be in a complete steaming huge pile of shit, unlike the small one he is in now.
---
We really needed something exciting to happen and this was just in time. The meme floodgates have now truly opened.
---
as it stands, this deltaxi guy hasn’t dropped character yet; no real lawyer posts their case stuff on reddit lol
---
&gt; In the United States a private business cannot slander or defame a public figure.
---
A counter argument could easily be made that they didn't.  AFAIK, these claims were made exclusively against his in-game alias, with no mention of his real life identity.  He is the one that publicly connected his IRL and his EVE identities.
---
6th step for lobbyists, become a televangelist
---
Well, there's also the time they banned Gigx for literally asking where Judge lives RL and implying he wanted to cut the man's hands off but ok retard
---
he's a lobbyist?
---
Thus the 'I'm such a shitty lawyer I tied my real life to a game where I was stupid enough to break a NDA so blatantly a couple devs in Iceland who literally could give two fucks bothered coming in to work to ban me thus harming my real life by exposing what a colossal moron I am.' post we are all commenting on.
---
&gt;works in politics
---
&gt;completely honest
---
that's a realistic scenario
---
Except in this case, CCP explicitly own Brisc Rubal and everything to do with Brisc Rubal... Brian linking his IRL personality with his IG avatar was his own doing. 
---
Your argument is moot because Stormy Daniels doesn't come with a EULA, NDA agreement and a TOS. One is a product, hosted in England, run by Icelanders and owned by Koreans, the other is a publicity hungry cock sucker (Daniels, not Brisc).
---
Well spotted.
---
&gt; Yeah cause TheGigx was so very incognito. That's why he was around for months before getting another ban.
---
No, he was around for months cause they let it slide as at that point he was already a "has been" instead of "is". Only once it reached a certain point did they hit him again.
---
because they always do when they remove from csm
---
idiot troll
---
If it’s true then it is what it is. But just doesn’t fit them to make a choice like that
---
So what? CCP didn't sanction that, just like they don't sanction CSM members to run and tell their friends up and comings.   
---
Id rather CCP pick and chose the winners as opposed to whichever group of nerd gets the most dudes on a space council.
---
lol only in EVE
---
was nothing my dude, things are crazy today :D
---
Naa.  I don't believe CCP would take this action without very good reason.
---
&gt;you aren't owed due process when a service provider revokes your access my guy. an attorney would know that tbh
---
Depends on where you live. A number of jurisdictions view their laws as having higher precedence than documents written by companies to limit their own exposure, so it isn't always so cut and dried.
---
How do you plan on "Fighting" these allegations?  
---
You are a Maritime lawyer - CCP acts like an Captains at Captains mast.  There is no due process, there is no pleading your case.  You have been found guilty and "Awarded lifetime ban"  
---
The sooner you put this behind you, the sooner you can admit to yourself what you did, then maybe in due time, you can apologize to those hurt by your actions.
---
Then we can ban THEM!
---
You will be forgotten as what you really were. Insignificant, corrupt and a wannabe.
---
#feelsreelbadman
---
"But where do you put in the payoff money?" *Checking lobbyist handbook*
---
Brisc yeah, he's capable of this. Pando and Shines no. They have nothing to gain from it, either personally or for the alliance. They are no-nonsense kinda guys. It's just not their personality at all. They would have told Brisc to get fucked instead of acting on any inside trading.
---
&gt; it’s a mistake.
---
this post is a mistake
---
your argument falls down on one very small but vital point, they haven't banned or named any person, only a character in a space pixel game- as far as I know hurting a space pixel character  hasn't yet led to any law suits
---
Many people could argue the same of many real world politicians. The benefit of democracy is that you get the politicians you deserve. The problem with democracy is... etc etc
---
Very legal. Very cool.
---
the love form china. good job GM .
---
Hell it wouldn't be the first time ccp banned someone over a misunderstanding or the firs time they lied to players. All I'm saying is that I'm not ready to say they're guilty without having seen any evidence. If it turns out to be true and there are logs to proof it I'll gladly accept it.
---
I laughed out loud at my office when I read this line. 10/10 Attorney
---
&gt;you'd think CCP would have approached this more delicately.
---
I don't think anyone who works there even understands how to spell delicate.
---
Brisc deserved this ban, but is your reputation (lmfao fucking pl) much better than corrupt lobbyist's
---
not to mention win or lose USA news will be talking about it and that means new people to join EvE, i hope ccp does not drop that low tho.
---
"The slightly less worse than the actually worst CSM"
---
I'd wear it with pride. It means I must have accomplished at least something before crashing and burning everything...
---
It can damage him to the point of him losing his "job". CCP is not to blame for this guys idiocy. The only big thing CCP did here is banning of a csm memeber for nda breach and illicit ties along side 2 of the main fcs of his alliance. Don't worry, this was not an overnight thing. Probably a thought out process. This nobody crying out like a baby is only gonna get responses that will probably say something along the lines "Nope, do this, that and that and you are out." aka what Falcon told the goon RMTer that got banned recently.
---
S, I was only passively aware of Brisc's existence until today, mostly just because he was occasionally an asshole to people (but not unusually so), but based on the talking in stations recording earlier and a quick read through his posts here and on the eve forums, I definitely don't know what you're talking about. I mean, I sort-of come to the same conclusion: purely for isk he might not risk it. But he's clearly the kind of guy who A. Doesn't expect to be caught anyway and B. Would definitely risk it for real money, via RMT. 
---
I'm not trying to say "he did it". I do think he probably did, but I'm open to the possibility that he didn't, and I really hope this gets corrected if so. All I'm saying, is that if CCP end up having to publicly prove his guilt and we all see that he did, in fact, breach CSM NDA, nothing about any of his conduct that I have been able to find would cause me to be surprised.
---
" I will fight these false allegations, restore my reputation and seek all avenues for recourse available to me for these reckless actions. " Whether he has a case or not, that line is lawyer speak for I'm going to sue the fuck out of you.

---
you know what you must be absolutely right because this is just what the lobbyist man would say too
---
I’ll upvote you cause I hate rorqual pilots.
---
Well, no, that just proves he was under NDA, they need an actual statement which violated it.
---
I'd be extremely surprised if CCP would ban a high-ranking CSM member without doing their homework first.
---
I agree a lawsuit would put the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) into overdrive. That said, it's already on PCG. This is probably already rolling further than we'd expect bc it involves politics, and people eat that shit up (especially allegations of corruption).
---
Serious question.  What's the possibility that he was framed?
---
INB4 he gets fired from his RL job because of this.
---
You are factually incorrect.  Defamation of character does not care what moniker is used, it's the individual that is tied to that moniker that is damaged or injured and they are entitled to a recovery.  Please don't try to Texas law unless you know Texas law.  Based on news articles that have been published for more than a year, Brisc Rubal is in fact an individual, and that moniker has been associated with the real individual, therefore disparaging the moniker is disparaging the individual.
---
No he is an attorney and works in politics in order to be effective in his role his integrity cannot be besmirched.  By saying he violated a NDA ( a legally binding contract) it besmirches his professional reputation.  Which can have a negative impact on him irl. If it is challenged legally CCP will have to provide evidence that Brisc did in fact breach contract.  If they cannot provide sufficient evidence then they must retract the statement and could possibly be liable for any irl damages for making a false claim of breach.
---
Entertainment and my glee that a shithead like Brisc is caught for this, it's really sad such a historic alliance like Initiative could go down like this. Bliss might not be able to hold it all together if all three remain banned...which is bad for Eve content in general.
---
lmao, this sub is dead af compared to just two years ago.
---
No surprise which political party he was associated with. Lmao
---
He could've done worse, he could've mentioned that he's a *republican* lobbyist, and maybe mentioned a russian somewhere along the line
---
First he says 
---
&gt;i don't like it when people just get banned for seemingly no reason
---
then he says
---
&gt; brisc is an actual dickweed and i'm actually kinda happy he's banned. 
---
I'm not commenting on the situation because I don't know Brisc and I certainly don't know any of the facts of what happened, but imagine trying to hold a position against opaque ban conditions and then follow it up with "but it's okay when it happens to people I don't like". Nice.
---

---
he should sue them for Libel just so we can all have more shit to laugh at
---
I'm with you on this one, to be honest. I don't have a bias or fondness for Brisc one way or another, but if there is a way to immediately make me distrust someone, it's writing up something like this. If I have to choose to put my faith in a company I've been paying for 13 years, who were approached by a body of people that are allied to Brisc about his wrongdoing, and a company that takes months to gather information on cheating/botting to make the process thorough enough beyond repute, or a guy who has spent his professional life not only learning to suit the law to his needs, but to also purchase the law, then it's a pretty easy decision on whom I put blind trust into.
---
Hey you talk on Reddit a lot. I thought you told me you were a Mormon Missionary.  You really need to focus on the work brother.
---
Make it the best two years and clean up your language. Your mama needs to clean out your mouth after most of your posts.
---
have you seen CCP's track record? Exhibit 1
---
&gt;I didn’t leak anything. The only thing I can think of was my ~~brother~~ son was using the computer and was playing on my account earlier. I don’t know if he did anything but I’ve always been honest please unban me it’s a mistake.
---
He even prearranged it in his campaign video...
---
That was a nice stab at CCP
---
Maybe Brisc was just a sacrificial lamb so that the masses can be sated while the rest of the CSM can continue leaking. Who would suspect someone who reported a leaker, after all
---
/tinfoilhat
---
 so as your the lawyer show me case law.. you know the bit that matters, where a pixel game character has won any sort of case...  just one will do
---
This is total bulshit, those 3 guys are most honest players in eve.
---
You're blinded by your anger, you must accept bart into your life and then you can accept the True Path.
---
He tweeted his rebuttal to the accusation on his personal twitter with his real name.  Gaming sites are already reporting on the "American Politician caught up in video-game corruption" using his real name in the articles.
---
He wouldn't have signed the NDA as brisc rubal.  He signed it as a real person.  Claiming that he violated an NDA is not claiming that Brisc did it, it's claiming that the real guy did it.
---
You might find this surprising but CCP actually has to earn the money they get. The stakes are a little higher.
---
&gt;So he is probably a moron...
---
You already had that covered with 'resident of Texas' /s
---
However, think about the time it takes for this video game and CSM obligations. It may hurt his image "wasting" time playing video games ect ect
---
&gt; If he would have shut-up about his RL job to begin with
---
he never would have been elected to the CSM
---
So first I agree to the possibility that he wouldnt expect to be caught anyway. Hiding in plain sight and being so high profile, like he was, that no one expects him to cheat the system. But I always come back to the why. As I said, I can't see it for the ISK and I very much disagree with your 2nd point of RMT. The guy is like 50, has a wife, a kid and drinks expensive booze in his mansion style office every stream. He's a lobbyist in DC and can't believe he's struggling for money so he has to RMT.
---
What, he's a wormholer? ..... by the way....
---
Plus, it's his own fault for linking his IRL identity to his in-game identity.
---
Learn to keep your space politics and real politics separate.
---
I mean, when you're a lobbyist with a history of breaking legit NDAs...
---
If used right it can. But the original dd was the same but just 250km in diameter so this is better and not nearly as broken. But with how many titans there are in game... yeah
---
Look at what the Chinese have done with their titan fleets. Three fleets at different points in space enclosing a hostile fleet and lancing everything out of existence. We are not that far from the imperium from being able to do the same unfortunately.
---
I mean you would think that you wouldn't need to tell CSM members that getting up on stage at a Fan Fest and telling everyone to harass some player until they committed suicide was a bad thing to do, but apparently...
---
Nothing, on a true exploration ship all you need is a covert ops and a sister's launcher.
---
I am an engineer so everything about rights thats not work related is like gibberish for me. Thank you for clarifying so far.   
---
So... Well since he obviously is attourney and maritime lobbyist I would think he would be seen as a public figure either way if hes saying it or not.

You know who else in eve is an attorney and covered by a nda? I have no clue because they aren't stupid enough to tie their real lives with their shady internet character. Ccp listed a high profile cheater using only their in game moniker just the same as every other company publishing ban lists. The harm done to his reputation is entirely his own doing and affords him no extra entitlements.
---
civil like the rampant shitposting i saw in the response thread?

Been divulging too much fake news this one has. Next move identity politics too eh?

Getting banned for insider trading coraxes would just be sad. It's not like they are valuable or a limited comodity.
---
If this was a true New Eden ending, Brisc would have pulled a gun, Shot Mittani in the face, Killed Dragon and then proceeded to dump every wallet and abandon every ship, and dump all  the contents of every station for the entire corporation.  -Samson Com-
---
Ok im now reading this sentence for the past 5 minutes and still dont get it. He is from Init not NC. and why dock all faction titans if it was one. im sorry but i have a headache now :-/

He deserves to know why he got banned, so he’s ccp sort of is obliged to tell him why he got banned

thanks for your contribution

it would harm him regardless, they are essentially claiming he violated contract law.
---
Horde seems to function perfectly fine without any leadership presence at all...
---
i've heard there's a law in the EU that if you're invested in a service (like a game) that your access can't be summarily revoked without reimbursement
---
not sure if that applies as iceland isn't in the EU, but they are part of many trade agreements
---
idk

This is liberal brain right here... sick. He didn't mean to hurt that child... he loved the child.

Liberals, pretending to be good people while protecting criminals and so lost and brainwashed they dont see whats wrong with that.

Being able to ban Brisc and his game characters isn't the point of contention. The point of contention is that CCP claims he broke an NDA. Doing so is damaging to him, **IF untrue**.  
---
The fact of whether or not he purposely linked his RL and game persona is a likely a moot point, they are linked, whether it was done intentionally or not, it just stands as fact.  
---
I'm interested to see where it goes if the legal machines start-up. I actually did some googling and couldn't find any similar cases.  
---
:Grabs popcorn:
---
So what you are saying is entitled assholes irl should be able to tie their identity to their characters and be allowed entitled assholes online?
---
Yeah, that's why Gawker won that lawsuit against Hulk Hogan.
---
OH. 
---
WAIT.
---
No, you're the one saying that my dude.

---
Maybe he should leave that off his CV though.
---
What's funny is CCP do not have to have a reason to retake assets or ban people. They can do it at any time and they really do not have to give a reason. They do however have a duty to the playerbase to publicise the fact you have been removed. They do not need to give a reason, nor should they. Goodbye.
---
Quick, someone make a flag for us to salute, sing to and hold during parades!
---
Get fucked.
---
omg ty
---
When are you guys merging into snigg?
---
we're going from corrupt lobbyists (or to put it another way, lobbyists) to presidents then are we? Ok, how about years of Donald J. Trump lying (who unlike shillary has ever actually been president)
---
It's not just Brisc, CCP wouldn't take down DarkWhines and Pando without actual proof. 
---
We'll likely never know but I'm curious what assets were confiscated, and why \~only\~ a 1 year ban was issued to each.
---
Brisc's would be deserving, broke NDA, enjoy the perma-ban.
---
When CCP is claiming that someone broke an NDA, that’s not related to the EULA or TOS. And who do you think signed the NDA anyways? It wasn’t “Brisc Rubal”.
---
can we also grope the flag
---
He's probably better off cutting peoples lawns with toenail clippers for $5 per house and just plexing.
---
sweet ty
---
/r/evejobs  is that way -&gt;
---
&gt; I don't know that he would win, but he could make the argument that CCP saying he broke an NDA could be detrimental to his real-world profession and reputation, and at least force them to reveal their proof through discovery.
---
This argument about material damages isn't a stretch at all. The NDA he signed is a legally binding contract as real as any NDA he might make with any client or employer.
---
Public accusation of breach of contract minus evidence = defamation.
---
Public accusation of breach of contract with evidence is just the truth.
---
CCP should have just said "his account is banned for a violation of the EULA" and left it at that, with the obvious implication to players being CSM stuff, and that implication being lost on the 99% of the world that doesn't play EvE-Online a spaceship MMO leaving no connection to his IRL law practice. Instead now anyone can put his name into the Google and get news hits about him violating a NDA and getting fired from an internet spaceship council. 
---
There's a reason most employers will only state a person's dates of employment and hang up, rather than explain why they fired/terminated someone. As soon as they cross that threshold and offer anything maligning they're obligated to defend those statements if pressed. Well he's pressing CCP.
---
So, this is a time when "dredit is recruiting" is relevant. After all, gokus are very similar to stukas. We might fill 2 full fleets of gokus occasionally if a bunch of init people join, we already sometimes have to put tackle or harpies in a different fleet.
---
He's a Republican. They literally don't care about laws regularly. I'm 0% surprised.
---
He's famous on Reddit now...
---
I would say that its pretty obvious this guy is lying about his status as a public servant in the US, all will be revealed, and im pretty happy cheaters are getting banned finally...
---
Reporting for duty
---
Truly hope CCP comes to their wits about it and bans whatever CSM member cooked this one up
---
If he really wanted to go down in flames regarding NDA he could just copy/paste all his chat logs of CSM channels, or what ever other info he has.
---
If even his fellow goons turned him in, how far from the pack had he strayed?
---
Or he could continue pushing a proven false allegation that not only wasted dozens of millions of dollars through investigations, but also led to extreme division. Real classy
---
Except the part where if I were in his shoes and signed the nda with my real name ccp would ban str828. My boss could be an avid eve player and see this whole shitshow unfold and never that str828 was/is spitting in his coffee every day.
---
Good try /u/deltaxi65 but this holds more weight for me.
---
Just a thought, Brisc DID have a laptop in front of him during the summit....
---
CCP claimed he breached a legal contract.  Reread the blog https://www.eveonline.com/article/ppne2z/brisc-rubal-removed-from-the-csm-13?origin=launcher they claim that he breached NDA. That can be challenged in a court of law. Now they never have to unban him or anyone right or wrong.  However if challenged they will have to produce breach of contract.  If they are unable to produce sufficient evidence then they cannot claim breach of contract and will be forced to recant.  If that is in fact the outcome of a legal challenge then maybe his reputation can at least be exonerated.
---
Who on the CSM is going to feed them a hit on INIT?
---
You should have worn a wizard hat.

Guess the fancy lawyer never read the games TOS which says anyone can be banned for any reason, at any time.

Well, if you didn't violate the NDA for your removal before this post, you sure violated it now!
---
WhATAbOUT

This comment aged well lol.

I saw no proof?

Can confirm the arts and crafts activity is fun and enabled me to identify Habit as my forever home. Some say its the greatest corp in Eve, others say its the greatest corp that will ever be. What I do know is the corp believes in redundancy therefore it will never be leaderless. Elise did something right?
---
low sig, niiiiiiiiiice.
---
Adversity is recruiting
---
I kinda read it as "well this sucks but it couldn't have happened to a better person".
---
I also don't have any idea who Brisc is, so that's not what _I'm_ saying, that's just how I interpreted the post you're replying to.
---
Buddy, no one cares that you're an attorney or a "much respected public figure" in the country you live. 
---
The fact you think these claims earn tiu special status says as much about you as the ban itself.
---
Its not ccps fault brisc tied his rl into eve life
---
You can enjoy when bad things happen to someone and it not really be okay, that's just an opinion on a person.

Dude, it’s a video game.

I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not defending him specifically, but your are acting ignorant if you condemn all lobbyists. If politican wasn't a career like it was originally ment to be, perhaps the career of lobbyist wouldn't exist. 
---
But since it is, they are essentially necessary for a variety of reasons. There are many legitimate things to lobby for. Since people need to work to put food on the table, having someone be in local/state/national assembly areas to represent a groups interest is necessary. Just a lobbyist on what they are doing, not what they do. The real evil are the career politicians.
---
I've worked in healthcare nearly my entire adult life. Having an association to lobby the interests of my profession to enhance care I'm able to provide to patients is essentially neccessary.
---
the more I think about it the more it seems like there is almost no good outcome for brisc for filing a lawsuit and given CCP isn't gonna release anything without such a lawsuit I suspect none will ever take place.
---
Okay Erotica1.
---
THIS! i would go so far as to create a hole new identity for your avatar....
---
One of those cringy eve grandpas, you know the type.
---
 He is an irl politician and acted like a politician with a lot of cringe and empty words in eve too. 
---
He was in csm and got banned for leaking info while under NDA.
---
That is no shame but he dragged 2 fc's from his alliance with him which is a shame.
---
&gt; Your job is legalized bribery, and as such your integrity is questionable by default.
---
I don't have a horse in this CSM Banning race, but your comment is pants on head retarded.
---
What do you call an informed expert who speaks to a bunch of non-experts in congress about how to legislate complex issues they don't understand?
---
What do you call someone who petitions a congressman on behalf of concerned citizens who can't personally take time off work to fly to DC and camp outside their office everytime legislation is on the table?
---
The answer is a lobbyist. 
---
And I'm not being facetious with a "hur durr Congress is full of retards" gotchya with that first question, that's a serious no-bullshit issue because a room full of people who've spent their career in politics is by definition a room full of people who are amateurs at everything else. The blind lead the blind in Washington, but at least with a lobbyist there's someone shouting at them not to walk into the middle of the street and get hit by a truck.
---
Just read the EULA.
---
Except a quick search shows he is a *republican* lobbyist, which by default makes him garbage and untrustworthy. I don't see how this damages him anymore than his current position / ideology. It's pretty much expected of him to break laws and ignore NDAs.
---
Hah, the real reason he was banned was because he would not mine Ochre first.
---
Ooh, a *throwback*. I like your style.
---
Space court is only entertaining with "Xel" at the bench.

American thinking his laws apply to iceland and/or south korea is hilarious. &lt;popcorn&gt;

---
What in your history with CCP would make you think they'd do their homework. On anything. ?
---
Now there's something I can get behind!
---
Eh, I don't think the courts will see it that way. If you say something about a public figure which is tied to being a public figure, then you are correct. But since the claims of CCP have nothing to do with his position in public life, this added requirement of malice would not be a factor. 
---
Of course, this is why common law isn't code law -- so these minor delineations and clarifications can be made on a case by case basis. Internet lawyers who pull up all these little rules do not understand the legal body upon which it is built and how it applies to this situation. As they say, "tell it to the judge".
---
Yes you can bring your Revenant to J5A
---
&gt;Brisc's reputation speaks for itself, he is an outstanding member of the community in every respect who has been a great contributor to the CSM and the greater community through his engagement.
---
ahahahahaahahhaahahahaha
---
Personally I feel you can get away with just the 3s Align that the Astero has on the base hull, I think it's a waste of potential to use rigs/low slots on Align Time. I just use a single rig on Warp Speed, but that's because I'm a sucker for fast warps. A single T2 Warp Rig goes from 5AU/s to 6.25AU/s, which if your warp is longer than 15AU~ then you've saved more time than that extra second align time did.
---
"Brisc Rubal might have been the only innocent man in  EvE.."
---
But are they actually tring to slander / defame him, they only mention his character's name. Or am I all of a sudden exempt from this rule as long as I'm a public figure + make an effort to show of that I'm this character in a way that Brian has done?
---
&gt;  grants CCP the authority to post disparaging comments about the person accepting the terms.
---
CCP is sitting on the proof and they literally just made a blogpost about him + the other player being banned. Again, they are not going around shouting Brian's name everywhere. That's not the reason the press knows of this. Additionally, this might be a longshot, but I'm pretty sure you do accept more than what a regular player has to accept if you're to be a part of the CSM. Not that I know what exactly.
---
&gt; and speaks directly to the individual's credibility.
---
While that is true, I don't really know of anyone else that has done as much as Brian has done to show off that he's shooting spaceships plus a politician. I'm certainly not the first person to say this, but keep games away from your professional life.
---
The fact that it happened to him isn't exactly a good thing either, I'd imagine it's pretty bad for someone in that line of work to break a NDA that's between you and another company. Also I would imagine you're a little more than just someone that plays a video game when you sign up for this. 
---
&gt;  unless they present all of the evidence.
---
With that being said, I do agree with you on this part. I'd like to see more information from CCP, it's just strange that we don't get to know more. While it might be for the public's eyes, at the very least give more information to the three people affected in the coming days. Personally I believe that CCP won't just go out of their way to ban someone AND create a blogpost about it if they weren't sitting on their own proof that couldn't be proven wrong.
---
Shit will get significantly more interesting if a billionaire with an axe to grind suddenly jumps into the fray, or if a CGI sex tape of Brisc doing something naughty in Captain's Quarters gets leaked by CCP.
---
Why not shoot them?
---
I don't know enough about law to know if you're right, but it sounds right so I up voted you.
---
Best thing for him would be if he gets to talk to CCP directly and they agree to remove the NDA violation, scale it down to EULA / TOS violation and just leave all his accounts banned. Second best is if he does file such a suit, they essentially do same thing but settle it behind closed doors without it going to actual court.
---
If it gets to court and he loses hes gonna be really really screwed.
---
idk seems like he can't seem to keep his mouth shut tbh
---
Elise Randolph , The Mittani
---
What is the procedure when innocent?
---
He sounds dumb af might have leaked due to a smooth brain tbh
---
lol because republican lobbyists are so much worse than democrat ones. nice joke.
---
He has a job?
---
He got hit harder with that then the rorq has during its entire conception.
---
Is the esports thing a reference to Jayne or ami missing something?
---
Please tell me what gender you are so I know whether you just turned me gay or not. 
---
Seriously, fantastic post and I second all of it.
---
Can't be that, you could see that nerf coming a long time ago. Predicting what CCP will do is not the same as knowing -- even though the behaviour might be identical.
---
if bribery counts yes
---
I'd imagine if Brisc is innocent he will challenge this in an court of law.  However if he is guilty he will quietly fade out of EVE.
---
Lmfao
---
The glove didn't fit!
---
Cringelord confirmed.
---
And these are your shining examples of making smart choices? Lol
---
It's not so much "over a game" it's "over CCP's business". We see it as damaging to the game but in reality it's damaging to ccps bottom line
---
fuck
---
No they are not. They dont owe him any explanation at all. I highly doubt there is any clause in the EULA about explaining CCPs actions. They're a private company that can do whatever the hell they want to, in regards to your access to their service, as soon as you hit "Accept".
---
Facts don't care about your feelings, friend.
---
Imperium spin turned up to 11. 
---
You got busted, it wasn't for botting, input broadcasting, doxing, or any of the other shit your Coalition pulls. But thank you again for reminding why were all "grr Goons".

You used your IRL info to win a seat at CSM, its not CCPs fault you decided to associate the two.
---
Not the only viable, but definitely the most fun
---
You play eve, right? Have you never seen them fumble a play?
---
[ITT](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3paPS3W0AcSew2.png)
---
They'd throw it out of court after listening to the tryhard.
---
&gt; If Brisc were to bring this to court that would bring far more attention to it in his line of work
---
I mean if you type his IRL name into Google the top hit is [a-real-life-lobbyist-was-just-permanently-banned-in-eve-online-for-corruption](https://www.pcgamer.com/a-real-life-lobbyist-was-just-permanently-banned-in-eve-online-for-corruption/). That's pretty bad.

&gt;In the United States a private business cannot slander or defame a public figure. They do not have immunity to execute free speech when that speech is harmful to an individual directly.
---
The US Supreme Court has made it clear that clauses in EULAs dealing with legal proceedings are almost always respected in court. CCPs EULA states that any lawsuit must be filed in Iceland. This wouldn't be applicable in the EU for instance, but it is in the United States. So the only jurisdiction applicable here would be that of an Icelandic court, as no US court would hear a case presented against CCP in the United States, as the defendant has already waived his right to file it by agreeing to the EULA.
---
Law's got nothing to do with it. It's all about reputation.
---
I don't know, like, keeping this terrible game alive for almost two decades? Strikes me a pretty good track record.
---
Correct, Pando was not affected but all of my own accounts were banned for 30 days. I held my hands up, took the ban and had no hard feelings with CCP. Despite what CCP said at the time most people used it for moving alts and scouts with a fleet (FC life.)  
---
Since then I have been very careful to not even curse in local, in private channels etc. Anything that could possibly get me perma banned if someone wished for that to happen.
---
Fair point. Before this I honestly didn't know much about him. RMT, especially on the scale that might be possible with this, seemed probable to me but perhaps not. That said, his claim that he didn't share anything *that could have been monetized* suggests (potentially) that isk or money might not have been a motivator. He might have even interpreted the NDA to state that leaks that couldn't be "monetized" weren't covered by it. Shoot, maybe the NDA is worded that way based on some interpretations, I don't know. Might even be able to a make a case based on colloquial differences between how English is used in Iceland vs the US. But if that's the case it's pretty slimy.
---
I'm just speculating at this point, which is meaningless. I just know that while I like to understand people's motivations, I don't think me not understanding them is much of a case for innocence, on its own.
---
When it comes to game development yes, many times.
---
But this is a entire different beast.
---
Really?
---
&gt;As an attorney and a public figure in the United States, my ethics and reputation are regulated by a code of professional responsibility and statutory law
---
&gt;literally linked his in game name to his professional personality
---
Stop my sides hurt

---
Origin. is recruiting! All applicants in the next 24 hours will get a free +1 from Elo!
---
No imagine you are an attorney or lobbyist and you want to improve your career and you apply or try to join a company group or decide to run for elected position.  All of these things might might demand that you have a clean slate and are free from controversy. A NDA breach or claim of NDA breach is saying " This person broke a contract that he entered into in good faith to not disclose information".  By stating he breached that contract it besmirches his credibility.  I would think he would have the right to challenge that claim in a court of law and demand evidence to be presented to validate CCP's claim that he did in fact breach a contract.
---
Pretty much this.  Everything CCP posts about him is referenced to his ingame character.  He willingly attached his RL name to that, so I don't see how they could possibly liable for any type of defamation claims.
---
Unfortunately, I'm unable to quickly find a case within the United States that directly relates to the defamation of a pseudonym associated with a real person, but the law is pretty clear that the name doesn't matter so long as damage occurred, see here:
---
28 U.S. Code § 4101
---
(1)Defamation.—
---
The term “defamation” means any action or other proceeding for defamation, libel, slander, or similar claim alleging that forms of speech are false, have caused damage to reputation or emotional distress, have presented any person in a false light, or have resulted in criticism, dishonor, or condemnation of any person.
---
Canada however has had a case which was impacted by this issue, where an online pseudonym was disparaged and the court found that there was sufficient evidence to connect the pseudonym to the individual, therefore the individual was damaged.
---
Baglow v. Smith, 2015 ONSC 1175 (CanLII)
---
...
---
[2] The plaintiff, Dr. Baglow, is the owner and operator of an Internet blog site known as “Dawg’s Blawg” on which he posts left-wing opinions and commentary on political and public interest issues, using the pseudonym “Dr. Dawg”.  However, while he posts his views under the moniker Dr. Dawg, his true identity as John Baglow is not hidden by him and appears to be well known among political bloggers.
---
Determination
---
[171]      To prove a case in defamation, a plaintiff must establish only three elements: first, that the words refer to the plaintiff, second, that the words have been published to a third party; and third, that the words complained of are defamatory of the plaintiff, in the sense that the words would tend to lower the reputation of the plaintiff in the eyes of a reasonable person.  I turn then to those three elements.
---
1. The words refer to the plaintiff:
---
[172]      It is the position of the defendants that the impugned words did not refer to Dr. Baglow but to Dr. Dawg, a pseudonym.  According to Mr. Fournier it was one person’s pseudonym insulting another person’s pseudonym.  There was no reference in “Hey yokels with pitchforks” to Dr. Baglow, until the Ms. Mew comment.  If the reader did not know who Dr. Dawg was, there could be no defamation of Dr. Baglow.  According to the Fourniers, the plaintiff’s assertion that a reader would take the time to google “Dr. Dawg” was totally speculative.
---
[173]      However, Dr. Baglow (writing as Dr. Dawg) does not attempt to conceal his real identity as John Baglow.  He has written some two dozen articles in the National Post Full Comment section from a left-wing perspective, where it is indicated “John Baglow who has been blogging as ‘Dr. Dawg’ since 2005”.  Further, he has posted on Rabble (a left-wing version of 
---
Free Dominion) where he has indicated that he is Dr. Dawg.  In 2006, Small Dead Animals, a right-wing blog with a very larger readership referred to him as “Dr. Dawg – John Baglow”.  In addition, Dr. Baglow was identified as Dr. Dawg in Free Dominion by the Fourniers some ten times prior to the “Hey yokels with pitchforks” post.  In fact, Ms. Fournier “outed” Dr. Baglow herself on Free Dominion apparently because she perceived that he referred to her as a Nazi and was angry.
---
[174]      *In my view the plaintiff’s position that some commenters and readers of Free Dominion would know that he is Dr. Dawg is supported in the evidence.  I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established that the impugned words refer to him. *
---
I'll update this post if I find a case that matches the case facts for the United States, I am certain there are some out there, but typically these are non-issues in the United States under the law because in order for someone to win a suit for defamation of these characteristics, they usually have to identify the individuals making the disparaging comments, which clears up any issues surrounding whether or not the pseudonym is sufficiently well known to cause reputation harm through the unmasking of an anonymous online individual.
---
WHAT HE SAID
---
He's not a politician, he professionally bribes politicians (he's a bottom-dwelling lobbyist).
---
Stay tuned I guess we will see.  If he doesn't I think that is reason enough to accept that CCP did the right thing.

Pffft
---
Your flair tho
---
that isn't how the american system of defamation works.  he is a public figure, so he would have to prove that they were at least negligent.  good luck with that.

Well, it sounds like he definitely did everything people asked...

I'm sure your opinion would be exactly the same if you found yourself surprisingly banned.

Which is almost certainly going to happen and it's going to be a bloodbath no matter what. Just when I was considering unsubbing from this shitty memefest of a sub too...

I have personally went through a couple situations similar to this with CCP.
---
I was having a lot of fun, and was sad it was cut short.
---
Thanks FC!
---
Maybe, maybe not. We haven't seen CCP go up against someone who can fight back like Brisc. If they missed the mark, they have put themselves in a spot.
---
I likes the commentary part
---
Instalock Interceptors are countered by your Cloak anyway, and honestly I've never needed that extra second to get away. Had three Rapiers and a Sabre try me so far in my Astero, and every time I got away comfortably. As always, it's intelligence/preparation that made the difference; keeping-at-range 2300m from the can, checking zKillboards if I pass any neutrals during my run, keeping my eye on DScan, and not letting my guard down. And when you're getting unlucky with systems, that extra warp speed adds up.

Americans?

depending on who you ask, the same thing is said by many in the US and Western Europe also.  Those same people probably believe that the US has aliens being held in Area 51, Kennedy was assassinated by the CIA and that the world is flat.

A lawsuit for defamation would not have any bearing under the EULA or TOS.  Both of these documents govern the use of the service.  The actions taken by CCP are not within the confines of the use of the service, they are a direct action against an individual.  In fact, by removing these issues from being under the EULA/TOS by arguing the defamation occurred, the discovery is more likely to reveal any and all evidence that CCP relied upon when making its disparaging comments, which is why this is an interesting legal case.
---
typical german player
---
Oh man good luck going against corporate lawyers, especially since CCP never actually mentioned any real names. Hand me the popcorn.
---
Its an age old precedent that CCP does not release information on bans. It hasnt done in prior CSM bans due to NDA breaches, why would it start now?
---
Confirmed, I'm just watching the time tick away until I'm dead.

"prove" is the wrong word. He might have to show that the balance of probability is damages.
---
Or he might not, some statements are considered obviously damaging.
---
but /r/meowtiger, nobody expects popcorn futures to go anywhere but up, you'd be shorting the market &amp; could lose a fortune!
---
Yes, they did, the post speaks to his credibility and therefore, if not true, is defamation:
---
28 U.S. Code § 4101 (1)Defamation.— The term “defamation” means any action or other proceeding for defamation, libel, slander, or similar claim alleging that forms of speech are false, have caused damage to reputation or emotional distress, have presented any person in a false light, or have resulted in criticism, dishonor, or condemnation of any person.
---
I'm hoping you are innocent. You seem like a cool guy and the story is so much better if you aren't guilty. (if only to watch r/eve implode)
---
Even if a US court was to uphold a judgement in favour of Brisc (which is doubtful given jurisdictional issues), enforcing any award across international borders would be a bitch. Particularly if an Icelandic court didn't agree with the judgement of the US court.
---
Nope. The least they can do is what they've just done. CCP owns everything that is in the game.
---
RemindME! 24 hours
---
Yeah considering the roster it's very unlikely one of the GSM would have done it and unless he was even remotely allowed to Jin would probably already have made a response that it was him.
---
We've not seen that before; so I couldn't say.
---
The community has kept this game alive.  CCP has repeatedly tried to kill it with pants-on-head retarded decisions for years now.  Only recently do they seem to actually be making any headway.

I strongly suspect it looks something like your list.

You where meant to give an example
---
I think he severely overestimates the trustworthiness of anything related to American public servants
---
How's that cloak gonna help at a gatecamp when you're aligning out?
---
CCP draining the swamp
---
The reality of the situation is that we will only ever know what CCP allows us to know and if they opt not to pass on information then we only have one side of the story.   
---
I honestly felt like Brisc was doing an above average job of really trying to keep true to what he said he was going to do with his CSM position. I'll respect that and encourage anyone else who picks up the position in the future to try to follow that path as best they can.   
---
If he did some devious stuff, well then he of all people would understand most the necessity of a ban. Should he save face even if guilty? Probably, his professional name is slapped on with some of this stuff, who's fault that is doesn't really matter so much to me, but if I were in his situation you're damn right I'd damage control this to the best of my ability guilty or not.   
---
TLDR -   Try not to let the possibility of a human making a dumb mistake ruin the idea that a CSM member can be more open and in touch with the playerbase.
---
Briber isn't exactly a job that indicates one has morals.
---
Is Jin 21 yet?
---
Nope. They don’t even have to say what they said in the public release. EULA is pretty clear cut. They provided that info out of a desire for an abundance of transparency to us. They are done with Brisc and it’s more likely that we figure out perpetual motion machines than that CCPs attorneys let them make a public statement about it without enough proof to secure a hostile American jury in a defamation lawsuit.
---
Because I’m pretty sure they’re well fucking aware what Brisc does as a day job and they just put a serious question mark around that shit if anyone digs. If they weren’t they’d have just banned his compatriots and watchlisted Brisc until such a time that they could guarantee they had a smoking gun.
---
Let me take a wild guess: US, Republican?
---
People spend their own money on the account, I’m pretty sure it might be illegal in a few places to do that
---
Because you can warp cloaked with it?
---
Iceland law doesn't have a separate standard for public figures.
---
But then you can do anything you want in game as CSM as long as you tie your real name to it, and by your logic CCP couldn’t do anything about it.
---
This is the kind of shitposting we need.
---
 "allegations," "charges","due process"

---
NDA, its right in the title dude,
---
&gt; What do you call an informed expert who speaks to a bunch of non-experts in congress about how to legislate complex issues they don't understand?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; What do you call someone who petitions a congressman on behalf of concerned citizens who can't personally take time off work to fly to DC and camp outside their office everytime legislation is on the table?
---
Meh. All this is on-paper. What they actually do in US is networking to bribe politicians in legally acceptable forms. In better-functioning democracies than US such a role doesn't exist because money is not as important as in US to get elected.
---
Because OP is a coward and doesn't want to be stuck vulnerable in space...
---
it´s a well known fact that they hate money. at this point i suspect CCP just exists as a money laundering scheme for icelandic whale hunting above sanctioned quotas.
---
I'm not sure how this would pan out to be honest, it's true there are no bilateral treaties that require countries to enforce international judgments, the galactic shit storm of media coverage surrounding this would be enough for CCP Games to take a step back about the public slandering of their players in open forum like they did to Brisc, whose name is well connected to his real life name, and who already has a place in the world as a public figure.
---
It's not about the ban or that process at all, it's only about the accusation of violating an NDA.
---
If they banned him for violating some CSM agreement or a game rule, it would have no implications on his RL because nobody gives a shit about video games.  The fact that they said he broke NDA has actual implications, because it's a real-world legal agreement signed by his real-world person, not his character.  If this is true, he can't be trusted to abide by any NDA that a future colleague may make him sign.
---
Talking in stations is better as audio only for some reason it’s really boring as a video
---
even if that's true that still doesn't mean you're entitled to an explanation
---
He couldn't argue that the actions of CCP were outside the scope of the EULA or NDA, as the actions taken by CCP were in regards to the EULA and NDA.
---
The only statement CCP has made was in regards to the breach of the EULA and NDA. (I'm certain the NDA includes the same clause regarding governing law as the EULA, which would also be respected in any US court.)
---
Making an announcement that an individual was found to be in breech of a legal document would not, under any circumstances, be considered defamation or libel in any US court.
---
The only case to be made here is that he was not in breech of the NDA, which could possibly open the door to a defamation case, but that would only be possible after a favorable ruling in an Icelandic Court, which brings us back around to my original point.
---
No, that is not what I'm saying at all.  Look, reading must be really hard, okay?
---
Whatever Brisc did in game, is his problem.  Whatever his accomplices did, also, their problem.  The issue here is not what happened in game.  CCP can ban him for logging in 1 second after downtime was over and they didn't like it, that's totally up to them.
---
CCP cannot, as a matter of law, just decide to go out and drag your name as a player through the dirt when your name is inexorably connected with your real life identity in such a manner as has occurred with Brisc Rubal.  That is wrong, and no one should support that at all.
---
He's not gonna sue, even if he's innocent the amount of shit that likely will float from open up his eve history to the public is unlikely to be worth mitigating the minor amount of damage to his reputation his contract violation for internet spaceships has done. 
---
Also keep in mind the most likely result of a brisc victory will be a CCP public apology and correction.
---
If Brisc thinks CCP is wrong, then he can file a lawsuit and prove that CCP did so. CCP feels they are correct, and given the breadth of their investigation with Noobman, I believe them. Therefore, they did not make a mistake by doing this. Traditionally, CCP has made a post whenever someone is removed from the CSM, while leaving normal bans out of it, which is exactly what they did here. They specifically did not name his co-conspirators because they are not CSM members. The removal of a CSM member affects the game’s community, however, and should be communicated.
---
The onus is on Brisc to prove defamation, and I invite him to do so if he feels he has a case.
---
When the evidence is under NDA, you think CCP will post that publically?
---
I'm pretty sure you did it. BUT I'm really hoping this is an epic psy-op from Goons or something because man would that be a better story.
---
Let's go with
---
\&gt; politicians would never lie
---
Let's not get into whataboutism and discussing politics that have nothing to do with EVE, okay?
---
:sob:
---
I think he'd be fucked in a suit. He claims in this post even that he's a public figure, which means he would need to prove malice.
---
Does *anyone* think for a moment that CCP did this with the intent of causing damage to his career?
---
He'd be roasted by the press if he tried.
---
Isn't the point of insta-lock to catch you in the time between when you align, lose gatecloak, and activate covops cloak?

they hated him because he spoke the truth
---
when the fuck did you learn how to type something that isn't hot garbage
---
Doomchumpchilla running off at the mouth, now way!!!!!!!!
---
Being a lobbyist is the most obvious one, but even if you don't know about his RL, every time he posts, he comes off as one of those arrogant assholes who thinks they are above the rules.  I mean, it makes sense with his profession, and it makes these accusations seem pretty likely.
---
Pretty crazy situation. CCP should release more information. Some of it may still be covered by NDA, but they need to release as much as they can.  Frankly, in a situation where privileged information has been potentially leaked to a few players, the fairest thing to do for the wider playerbase is to release that information to the rest of us.
---
If Brisc feels CCP has defamed him, he should file a lawsuit. Until such time, I believe CCP over him, as does the law. Stating truth is not illegal.
---
It exists in literally **every democracy** including the EU. It's functionally impossible to have a representative democracy if you ban people from talking to their representatives or from petitioning their government.
---
You're just wrong on this my dude.  Any time you attack someone's credibility, or state that they did "X" when "X" did not occur, you can be found to have defamed that individual.  
---
The TOS and EULA are contracts for the *use of the service*.  The situation with CCP Game's communication of actions taken is beyond the TOS and EULA.  
---
CCP Games must prove that the NDA was violated in order to level such an accusation against an individual (a finder of fact would need to verify of this, in other words, a jury or judge via bench trial), particularly given the nature and stature of this individual.  They poked the wrong bear on this one I'm afraid.
---
I was with you up until "only recently"
---
Only recently is when they've started moving away from what EVE was meant to be and started catering to the krabs and unnecessarily loud retards of hisec, trying to appeal to the masses in a game like this isn't "making headway" at all
---
Not just attorney....
---
... A lobbyist.
---
It's all about latency, but if you cloak with an insanely fast reaction time, you can get it within so little ticks that his lock doesn't go through. I do live in London, so that probably helps.
---
It's gonna be years and I would be amazed if CCP wouldn't play dirty and well given he's been playing for years I would be positively shocked if he has not said some dumb shit somewhere that's still in ccp's logs.
---
The number of legal experts and diviners of truth on r/eve is truly astounding.
---
I highly doubt legal challenge in this case. Is Brisc willing to risk his career by making this something on public record with evidence for the bar to review? He, as a lawyer, is accused of breaking a legal contract, and I doubt he wants any of this in a court room.
---
Why are the mom's always dead to a "your mom" joke. There are no mother's left alive in the world.

---
I think CCP Dopamine went into this a little too hard, he's still quite new afaik, so he may not have handled as he should have.
---
The only resolution is a trial by combat!  Make Jove space great again!
---
Frankly the fact that it'd be SO FUCKING STUPID in so many ways makes me wonder if this actually is a mistake...
---
Victim's opinion does not = reality
---
Brisc Rubal
---
To be fair, he's probably trying to deflect for RL reasons.  I'm sure he knows exactly what he did, but is just trying to cast doubt so it doesn't impact his actual job as much.
---
Hmmm Goons now without experienced FC's ??? I'm struggling to find the downside here?
---
I mean, I'm sure there are people who call themselves lobbyists in EU and other well-functioning democracies.
---
But their level of influence is so far away from their US counterparts, their day-to-day is much different, and they don't "bribe politicians in legally acceptable forms to get maximum policy benefit for the interests of an entity" as there are laws preventing this.
---
So setting the name aside, no they don't exist anywhere else.
---
&gt; He claims in this post even that he's a public figure, which means he would need to prove malice.
---
Yea, and I even forgot about this bit, been a very long time since I was involved in these sort of things.

---
Well for a CSM game is business. The NDA especially. So yeah a lawyer breaking NDAs does not sound sexy at all for RL as he broke a RL contract.. not a Jita 4-4...
---
zero.
---
All CSM tell people shit....this guy just got caught doing it. He isn't the first and should be the last\*  
---
(\* the CSM is a fucking joke. Get rid of it.)
---
That’s where I’m kinda leaning right now. I’m only going for buzzard because it’s the coolest looking covert ops in my opinion, so why even change my set up, may as well just slap the same fit I have on a buzzard 😅
---
.. a history? It's an unsubstantiated claim regarding a single occurrence.
---
We all know CCP is not infallible. They are prone to making mistakes and too stubborn to actually own up to them.
---
Excuse me but are you THE telefon tel aviv? the musician?
---
Key word there is "legalized". If he adheres to the rule of law in his day job, why would he casually break an NDA here?
---
Seems a bit harsh of Aryth to do something like this to a fellow Goon. I wonder what their motivation might have been.
---
*allegedly*  I'm *allegedly* a dirty fucking liar.
---
Christ.
---
From /r/all, what does this mean?
---
Yea because as an attorney he isn't versed in how to petition a court file briefs or make motions.
---

I don't think he understands that just because you bring it to the table, it doesn't mean it will be accepted. Op has to be a troll.

Yeah, poating this has probably sealed your fate in terms of the ban.
---
Maybe try star citizen. I hear they have a nice space game.
---
Ah, yes, there it is. Victim blaming. I had nearly forgotten that this is the internet.
---
this dude texas law's
---
Yeah because as an attorney he can be trusted with anything he says.
---
That's not true. Even if it was, there's no law that says a man can't hire a bunch of Fedos to pee on his bed. Fake news.
---
I am not sure what you mean.  Dude asked a question I answered it with information. Did I make any claims to anything other than that they are both attorneys and been under NDA from CCP?

Duuuuh what about Democrat lobbyist break their CSM NDA ?? I GUESS THIS NEVER HAPPEN RIGHT ? SO WHO IS THE BAD GUY NOW ???
---
They did a shitload of homework on Noobman so I’m pretty confident they did the same here.
---
Brisc is a lawyer in RL. Stating he breached an NDA (whatever this NDA is about is unimportant) tarnishes his name.
---
Your topic mentioned opinions, your post gave 0 opinions. I find you guilty.
---
If he broke the NDA, then no. If he didn't, then hell yes.
---
If he wants to file charges for libel (claiming breach of contract/NDA where no such occurred), he could do so quite easily. It wouldn't be the first case where the evidence relied on revealing proprietary information, and there are safeguards wherein that can be revealed to the court but not the public. However, they can't just say "oh, here's what he told people" in a blog without revealing what he told people. 
---
In short, if the lawyer really believes he is on the right side of this, he knows exactly how to get access to the evidence in support of the accusations and possibly clear his name by using the law (and the reticence in doing so is a little telling...). But the rest of us aren't entitled to know more than what CCP deem safe to release.
---
Wat.
---
They didnt drag his name through the dirt. They stated facts. Brisc Rubal disclosed information covered by an NDA. That information was used by INIT members not disclosed by CCP to make a profit.
---
They even expressed regret and pointed out the other csm members brought it to light.
---
Then provided a fair, even handed statement about the situation with no obligation to clarify.
---
Just because Brisc Rubal is a massive cock sneeze that very publicly posted on any platform that got him attention while simultaneously linking his career to his eve account has no impact on CCPs situation. I am assuming that the review of Brisc/pando/shines was very detailed and complete, leaving nothing in this vert public case to chance.
---
With projected sequel: "It's impossible I have done it"
---
http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/ for an easy route planner
---
I mean, I get where you're coming from but it seems pretty clear that he'd be considered a limited public figure whether he admitted it or not under Sullivan. 
---
We'll see how it all turns out.  He might end up going after the person who brought this to CCP, and depending on the facts surrounding that one can absolutely imagine evidence of actual malice on the part of another CSM / EVE players generally.

---
If he thinks he was wronged, he should file suit, but until such time as he proves otherwise, I’m fairly confident in CCP here. They don’t remove CSM members without a ton of investigation.
---
Nice try, but just checked the pond outside and the frogs are in fact gay. Lizard people these days man
---
Lobbyists have a ton of influence in the EU. VW was able to cover up faking pollution data for many years while DB was manipulating interest rates, dodging taxes and committing espionage. Neither got in trouble until the US started cracking down on them. All because of effective government lobbying.
---
"Throw an intern/family member under the bus" should be in there somewhere.
---
If this comes into a court then this might be the one in a million situation where we will get to know it. That while I personally condemn any CSM leakege I secretly hope Brisc is innocent and CCP (and a lot of ppl on this sub) eat shit.
