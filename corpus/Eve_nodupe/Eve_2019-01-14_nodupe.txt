you were rage rolling?  coulda fooled me, never saw any of you there

The Rorqual is also considerably more tanky, which generally allows it to survive assault long enough for reinforcements to arrive via cynosural field. The tank really is no joke. You need an high number of subcapitals to pressure a well-fit rorqual. 
---

---
Of course, this won't apply to you if you don't have enough friends, but why are you mining like that? 
---
IIRC, if you want to fit in all 5 Excavator drones, you need a 'Wetu' Mobile Depot which costs over 40mil, but the point still stands that any competent Rorqual pilot can put 5bil of his ship into a secure box if they ever get attacked, while the Rorqual itself is probably a 1-3bil loss depending on fit.

&gt;Brisc Rubal &gt; @here When they tell you it wasn’t a big deal, link them the Kotaku article. Congrats to Riven and Pando for making the mainstream gaming media. https://kotaku.com/the-year-long-undercover-plot-to-blow-up-eve-onlines-m-1831574442
---
oh no.  whatever will we do, now that we've evicted hard knocks from their wormhole they might take their four multiboxers and a parrot and bring them to delve
---
where our supercaps are
---
oh god we'll never be able to defeat you there
---
That happens when u recruit redditors
---
Why, in your opinion is it "retarded" to use caps to protect our industrial assets in our space. that seems like a very smart thing to do IMHO. i would very much like hear you expound on how you think we should play the game.
---
what this has anything to do with TEST, brainlet?
---
I'm okay with it on the condition something is done about Intel bots
---
Pods at a perch above a gate, that when podded undock and warp back to the same spot?
---
Yeah OK nice meme 
---
Omg pando you are so cool pando can you please take my hand an take me to a wormhole my gf is having mimosas with her  work friend and my house is cold and empty
---
Hk is so salty me and my 2500 close friends followed pando and not only pressed f1 but ALSO went in the hole COLD and came back HOT - that is a logistics mastermind move and i deserve all the praise in this here subreddit.
---
Pando pls on the weekend let us rorq mine together and can i please have Brisc tell me why we do this.. it is January and my house is cold wormholer salt will make it better lmao.. right guys
---
Btw i am only in Imperium because Jay is cool not a pet!!! Adapt!
---
Overcompensating for something, are we?
---
Hey man, I understand. I've never gotten too far into eve. I had a friend who introduced me and gave me a billion isk. I started learning ships and loadouts, tried mining but never found it fun until I started zooming in and fighting pirates. But even then, the game feels so lonely, especially for new players. We don't understand what to do or expect and watching gameplay doesn't actually make it better.
---
for any service you can just ask random in jita a lot and sort the answers by price. (should have at least 10 anwers)
---
then take the third lowest offer.
---
Not that I actually care about who shows up but.. TEST is deployed there, SV. is here. They're always on the same side when something interesting happens. Fleets from Delve has been here so there's more than just SV. in terms of goons. Isn't the cloaky campers in Kalevala Boat's SIG or something? Are all the guys that are entosising Kalevala in SV. as well, they all happen to be in TNT only.
---
Yes, but the rorqual never left 99.9999% safety. Now its 11b on one of the easiest most predictable grids there are. Still pretty safe with bloc support, but way more on the line than before.
---
Germans have always been hyperliteral retards pls stop bullying him 
---
If you play eve alone without any related social interaction then you’ll be missing much of what the game has to offer. It is the relationships that you build, nurture, and backstab later on that really make the game. For instance, you need a coordinated group to accomplish feats - without undue amount of autism.
---
nah after seeing how fast you rolled over and died it never feels premature anymore
---
Guys, we died.  This guy confirmed it.  We're totally not rolling for rorquals.
---
Well I'm not even in a corp yet so I don't know how all this stuff works just yet. 
---
I'm sure corp mates are more than willing to help their super caps when in trouble though.
---
You should join test if you enjoy structure bashing so much
---
Why are all goons dumd
---
its fun
---
covetors are also made out of paper and don't have the fitting space to put both mining mods and a tank on while hulk can.
---
I didn't include the Procurer because it's even worse than the retriever but I'll update the post with the procurer stats as well, thanks.  
---
Elite Beans run burner missions in a fleet, but that's so laughable I couldn't type anything out about it without breaking down.
---
&gt; the idea is to deter future roams
---
I literally cannot fathom how this is the goal. The idea is to prevent content from happening in the first place? Wow, what great engaging gameplay.
---
its the same people that call wwb casino war to this day, can you really be surprised they're as vulnerable to propaganda as a 6 year old.
---
wow you sure got him 
---
Your numbers are missing rorquals boosts.
---
&gt;i wouldn't be sad if all the toxic elements of every gaming community quit
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I look forward to you unsubscribing.
---
Ah, so the answer is to have dictors and hictors camping outside of staging keepstars whenever you're doing any roam under the supercap umbrella. Got it.
---
You all make null sound like everything is gucci.
---
yeah lets just ignore the fact sv batphone main goons for pretty much everything recently.  
---
'small' 35k group
---
That code belongs in `https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/`
---
No ratter or miner wants "content" while they are mining or ratting.
---
This is mostly intended for solo mining but I'm sure with boosts the hulk is difference is definitely going to warrant the extra cost.
---
Time to install Star Citizen. 
---
I understand exactly what caused it. That doesn't mean the resulting gameplay isn't absolute garbage.
---
That's true, but drone boats are good for starting PVE money making. You don't use ammo,no overhead just sunk costs, the plain Vexor will run lvl3 missions and is a good ship. Please remember that a PVE fit ship is not a pvp fit ship. Making money PVPing is harder as people are naturally inclined to be risk adverse, there is no such thing as a fair fight just a fight. Basically keep your money making hulls out of pvp as much as possible and vice versa. Find an active group of players you get along with is gold in New Eden.
---
So you want to deter any roams in your space because it hurts ratters'/miners' feelings? Tell me more.
---
Move to fucking hi-sec.
---
Its hard to believe someone as brain dead as you was put in charge of anything
---
I wouldn't blame them too much for not considering the value of an evacuation. Actual asset loss isn't a part of most player's lives in Eve 2018. 
---
Def armor. U should be fine on mass. Couple domis are 400mil top round trip. Most holes are 2b+.
---
Right proportion of women to be an eve alliance :p
---
Portland is gross. Owning a car is pointless and those maniacs only drive 55mph on the freeway. 
---
Kind of makes me want to play again
---
A sabre would show on dscan for several seconds before landing, unless it was cloaked up in the site waiting for someone to bite (in which case that's just unlucky, not a lot you can do against that).
---
If you're running a site then core probes can be as dangerous as combat probes, since your site is scannable with them.
---
Nothing can lock you up immediately. So if something hits grid, burn away from the can you're on and away from enemy, hit cloak and MWD. This will allow you to pull range and, unless you're really unlucky, make it hard for them to decloak you, so you can find a warpout. If you're flying covops you don't even have to decloak to warp out when you clear the bubble or whatever.
---
You can if you can hack a can in the time it takes to boat the ~10km to burn across its range.
---
Realistically most people can't do that, but you can be semi-aligned at say 200m/s (this gives you 50s to hack the can) which will probably cut your align time to 2s which is less than the decloak locking delay.
---
hows the football game pgl?
---
hm gons seem to be doing the same thing :thonking:
---
You haven't listened but you were triggered enough to leave a comment.
---
Yes, if you wanted to waste time getting to maximum range and lining up an align target.
---
Or you could just hack the can in that amount of time, and pay attention to dscan.
---
Gotta go for the low-effort, high-return posts, my man. Can cash all that karma in later for tiddlywinks.
---
Arent u in an alliance with a corp of hitler supporters?
---
Snuff claims to want content dropping titans on anything that moves gets rid of content, we on the other hand have made it clear want to have a select area of space that we control made safe for those earning their isk to afford their other endeavors. If you can't appreciate the value of space that is protected to allow lower risk money making for alliance members that's your issue. " Move to fucking hi-sec. " clearly you've never been to high sec, its a gankers paradise for those who know what they are doing. Null was created specifically to allow player to create their own player owned, played built empires, which goons have done.
---
What happened?
---
I know, but memes man
---
i feel insulted but its true
---
I always enjoy listening to a group handle shit well.  Awesome coms.
---
If they were going to test no local why fuck the entire chat system including corp, alliance and custom channels?
---
SC is a bunch of dirty blobbers, but so is the rest of Eve. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The hulk is alot tankier than a covetor (ofc still paper but the gap is huge) so if youre enormous jet can mining in null alone like i do i can survive ratspawns and warp out in time. if you watch local/intel theres no real danger of getting killed by a player.   
---
the only reason to use a retriever or mackinaw over that is because you want to go full on afk.  
---
i can link my fit for a solo hulk if you like
---
Adapt or die. Rorqs and skill injectors have been stupid for years now. The genie is not only out of the bottle, the genie met a girl, had kids, watched them grow up, and retired into a comfortable life of capital proliferance, multiboxing, and botting. Your complaint is old news. Figure out new ways to kill stuff. 
---
Nah man I'm not triggered, powers is a good dude. 
---
Yah the funny part was the wormhole crew that was at every chain entrance letting goons fly into rage
---
Chat isnt
---
I just took all the bling off my caps/subs, threw it all in a dst, and handed the cap hulls to people to SD for isk to make their move easier. It's not a case of "either way", this way I saved several billions worth of mods. I even sold hulls to Init members so I didn't have to move them later. We were back up and running within a week because we saved our assets. It's more fun getting back to killing stuff on a regular basis than having one massive feed followed by tons of downtime. Btw, most people don't consider a massive consensual feed purely because of pride fun. At least if it's non-consensual there's some aspect of adrenaline/surprise and stuff that makes a feed kinda worth.

 Because the local in high sec is broken too?

You better check in with Pando, you're behind on the current narratives.

1) You were fighting *ALL OF WORMHOLE SPACE*  and

2) Goons were never really there, init is a strong independent space guild that don't need no man.
---
Es ist eine verdammte Schande, dass kaum ein Schwanz deinen Comment verstehen wird.
---
First thing first, you could talk to someone consistently for six hours?
---
The reason I felt EVE is much addicting to many people is not how beautiful it is or the gameplay, yes I could appreciate a new ship model for a few minutes, but what truly kept many players invest tens of thousands of hours into this game is the player-built world, or the "sandbox" as CCP described.
---
Let me elaborate a little bit:
---
EVE is not a game directly provided players witj objectives, let them finish the missions and then gave them candies like any other games.
---
Instead, it presented new players with all the kool toys(t2 modules/ships, capital ships/super capitals etc.), and tell players they could only get them through a long grind.
---
The process of grinding itself is not fun at all, just like you've said in the topic, that is when the player-driven world kicks in.
---
EVE will be meaningless without players, just like on SISI, despite overwhelming amount of resources, 95% of the players still chose to keep grinding on TQ.
---
Why? You may ask.
---
The answer is simple: competition.
---
For krabs, there will always be a rich old fvckhead showing off his officer kill/loot somewhere either on in game channel or Alliance forum, and everykrab else wants to be that guy.
---
For PvPers, they all want to get that juicy 4B Tengu solo kill or even better, a Super, an AT ship.
---
Eventually, what EVE is all about is "I want to have the same stuff as that guy" or "I want to have that guy's stuff"
---
Kind of like your posting uninspired 
---
Yes, but they will still revive that fast when the air is 50% water, falling from the sky
---

we already had 1 'incident'..... please no more
---
The estimated number, like all estimation, was just made up and has nothing to do with reality.  However you did blob HK.  And that is how you evict in WH 
---
Yeah people say this a lot. Having a cloaked alt requires an extra omega account though which can't do anything else. Multiple if you're not in a dead end.  And if you're a legit player you need to actually pay attention to those clients. Not to mention wormholes. That is a whole lot less trivial than the current situation
---
My first eviction went something like this: 
---
  
---
Logged into TS  
---
CEO: Is that fifty?  
---
Me: Hey, mornin guys  
---
CEO: \*In panicked voice*  
---
"GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!!! PACK YOUR SHIT *NOW* THE CYNO IS OPEN! GET THE FUCK OUT!!  
---
And with a quick scoop of everything into the Thanatos and a couple of left clicks thus ended my tenure in Intrepid Crossing and my service in the drone land war.
---
that was you? god bless!
---
Hmm, looks like they went to YOUR home system and fought you OUT NUMBERED. AND, it looks like you dropped caps first. Seems you tried to bait them with calling in DNG and SASH dreads. Really ashamed Sash didn't log in some of those supers they have in Vard :( . I would have loved to have seen that battle report. I mean, instead of whining why don't you just gf as it looks like it was a good and fun fight? And literally NO ONE flying under Derpator can talk about taking fights that only you can win. Psssh.

What makes eve fun is those few moments of action you get as a result for spending hours in preparation.  You can roam all night and not get a fight for hours to suddenly be in the most intense fleet battle you've ever experienced.  Its not constant action, it can be tedious at times, and for those reasons it isn't for everyone.

Keeping in mind that a little extended tank can give a nearby rorq time to lock on and remote repair, or a cry of "HELP MEH I'M IN THE COLOSSAL TACKLED" to generate a response from a local PVPer.  
---
\- I say this from the POV of the guy trying to kill you. Yes it can make a difference.
---
I feel your pain. I have been playing since mid 2005 and I hit a wall with it, I also had taken a hiatus from it, numerous times but the only thing that draws me back is the PVP. Eve Online has a PVP system like no other MMO you actually feel risk in your fights. However even with that you have to stay engaged in that activity constanyly to feel that rush of the hunt, whether it be with people or solo.
---

No, so he screwed up and chatted with broadcast still on. CCP will be able to see if he was undocked at that time and punsihem him if he was.

CCP could try to hell ban the bots.  Have the accounts log into a mirror universe of Tranq, where the bots still do their botting thing, still pay subs, but don't affect anything on the player server.

I think everyone is pretty much just using zkill to search for pvp fitting ideas these days. It has pretty nice search functions and a lot can be learned there from fits to active war zones and other intelligence.
---
Eve-uni's wiki is a treasure still to this day with much of the information still valid. Their fits should be seen these days as suggestive not definitive. Realistically, no static site will be able to keep up with all the changes to ships and mods without intense updating.  Which brings us back to using zkill to always see the bleeding edge fits from dead experimenters.
---
That would never happen.
---
Hulk can tank belts rats. Covetor can't.
---
Eve is curious in that the fun is yours to define and make.  
---
I have fun playing like I'm a WW2 submarine engaged in a constant state of unrestricted warfare against Delve and Fountain. I fly about in a T3 cruiser and do my best to kill everything and anything I can find without getting blown up.   
---
Others have fun F1ing in fleets and waiting for the next ping to do so.  
---
Others have fun endlessly mining or ratting to be e-rich.  
---
Don't let yourself get recruited into some corp and flying around POS bashing. Find what makes the game interesting to you and stick to doing that. Don't get derailed in stuff you find boring. Well, we all need to generate ingame funds to cover our fun, but don't do that until you get to the point of wondering why the hell you log in I guess.   
---
And If you are ever at the point where you "work" ingame to cover your Omega because playing isn't worth $15, stop playing.
---
He was camping every system of delve... A pretty safe to say that he was undocked

P.S. Finally a thread where Vert is getting harder downvoted then me.
---
Wait how does input broadcasting help if he's cloaky camping multiple systems? Like isn't the point I of I out broadcasting to automate tedious tasks? What do you need to automate when camping? 
---
Oh snap
---
Missing a cyno
---
Aww bless your intelligence network is crap
---
I swear to Hedliner!!!
---
Do something else in EVE. Stop running missions. Get out of hisec.
---
Right now the most fun is happening in Null and in wormholes. So join a bloc or a wormhole group and change your style of play. I guarantee you will have fun.
---
Join a corp, it doesnt matter all that much unless you feel you need to have a clean employment sheet. Learn what people (in that corp) are doing even if you arent doing much of it. You can always leave the corp.
---
Eve Uni is pretty accurate for most pve stuff. CCP doesn't change much old stuff so it tends to stay relevant for a while. I would guess that manufacturing formulas and some tax stuff might be out of date but i havent checked that in a lomg time.
---
&gt;being this retarded 
---
Yes. And it was the stated intention for the rorq following the changes too. They just went full retard on excavator costs and mining yield though.
---
In regards to question 1:
---
It's so / so. Personally I wouldn't treat the fits as anything other than "This will kind of work". In terms of core information such as ship stats and stuff it's pretty solid. Same goes for missions information. Generally speaking you can trust the information on the wiki to get you started and by the time you start noticing problems with whatever advice it has you are able to fix it yourself.
---
Question 2:
---
This depends. There's nothing like WoWhead / gw2wiki for Eve nor is there any 1 stop shop for fitting information similar to build websites in other games. This is due to a couple of reasons but mostly this is because of the sheer options in the game in regards fits and possible scenarios you will encounter. 
---
For more general information it depends on what type of information you are looking to consume and what type of need you have.
---
Specific or very general "how do i" questions or meta / politics questions: weekly r/eve no stupid questions thread  
---
Isk making: various discords or corps / friends and even youtube guides. People guard their secrets and market PvP is very real. This would be best broken down into a specific category of isk making and region of space. There are a *lot* of ways to make isk and the knowledge barrier to a huge number of those ways is intense - far too much for a guide, wiki page or anything of that sort. In short, this requires a much more specific question.
---
What you seem to be lacking is proper socialization in the game. You really can't skirt around that with Eve like you can with other games. The problem is this statement:
---
&gt;  without joining a corp, which for various reasons isn't something I want to commit to quite yet
---
A corp is not a a permanent decision. You join one that aligns to your playstyle and schedule. If it doesn't work out you simply leave. There's no reason you can't join a corp - even if you only play 15 or 20 minutes every couple of days. 
---
I look at your questions / issues and quite literally all of them are solved by my own corp / alliance forums. The exact same resources I know for a fact are in a myriad of other groups internal resources as well. Your options are largely dictated by where you live so the locals tend to know best.
---
If you are still deadset on not joining a corp then consider joining an NPSI group (non corp groups that do stuff) or consider socializing a lot in chat channels or public discords. We've got one for the subreddit for example and the newbie-help channel would probably be of great use to you. If you like awful shit posting other channels exist to - but I'd avoid them otherwise.
---
To summarize though Eve is a social game at its core. Going it solo is not going to end well unless you are a very specific kind of person. Even if you are - it will take far longer than it would in a group.
---
Isn't tripwire run by lazerhawks as a way to track wormholers?
---
Horde just wants gfs, goons are bringing content. Everybody wins.
---
birdsquad?
---
You aren't wrong. But there are many different situations for mining: solo, mining ops, different security status, ice vs ore vs moon ore, and different levels of safety. I'm not going to bring our an exhumer unless I'm feeling reasonably secure and not watching Netflix at the same time. Ore hold size and warp time in to station can have a affect on profit if you are solo and not jet canning.
---
Don't overlook the T2 mining frigates. They warp fast and can speed tank belt rats. They are easier to move through dangerous areas.
---
we've given them exclusing naming access to all citadels. should be good 👍

Can I go to Curse do the angel epic arc even though my standings with the angels are -10 ? Or will I be shot inside the mission site ?

uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh let's just pretend that one happened in 2017
---
Oh that's weird. I filed a couple recently and one took 4 days for them to attach and the other was attached in a day. You can try what the automoderator said and poke CCP_Goliath about it.
---
hes lost that fleet several times.  someone pops up in local he'll chain panic rorqs for 6+ hours
---
Easy way around it. Dont go to whaling in Delve or Impass.

Thanks ! When you say sell for the trip to Be doesn't it includes all ships ?

I didn't get the death system yet. If I die I start over in my original system ?

I have no idea how I missed that one but it's a thing of beauty.

Did you?

He blames a bug for warping to the wrong sig instead of owning up to his mistake.

If you consider living in a vegetative state existing then i guess.

I thought they died in 2017?

---
That was exactly what I thought.  I missed it, randomly kill local for a few hours every other week.  Make rolling "no local" zones that pass through space from system to system.  Randomly pick someone with a reasonable amount of activity and make local for 1 jump around them dead, no matter where they go.  Then pick someone else, then someone else.  IDK, that one may be too far.
---
Imagine a legion and some dictors thinking they can go whaling unchallenged.
---
You have this weird obsession with this eviction and trying to regain the narrative for whatever reason.
---
Yeah, complete bullshit.
---
It’s all in the welcome mail. I left a bunch of stuff in hisec cause I didn’t really need cash when I joined. But it’ll likely be years before I’m back in that neighborhood again. So yeah... liquidize if you want.

You get the death station once you join corp. The welcome mail covers that (please read it all... it can be overwhelming but the dojo people are fantastic !) 7o

Fuck WTB Killmarks, known corp thief.

Yeah please link it, I have a rough idea of how it should be fitted but I'm down to see what fit you're rolling with.

Hopefully this inspires better use of punctuation.
---
and if you actually read it he warped to a magus that he thought was near the ravens, because of a bug that wouldnt let him warp to the other results
---
According to the December MER, you are somehow allowing goons to mine more with less rorqs then. Not sure your plan is working.
---
It kinda is. Its not ez to build a 40k alliance.
---
Have you considered joining them, sounds like you'd fit right in.
---
It's basically just me getting triggered about the wormhole narrative of "we never had a chance cause we got blobbed" while they clearly did even have the advantage at one point (shown in the most recent video). And i cant help it but engage in internet arguments... yes im not a smart guy :(

Shit that takes me way back... I remember doing the Low sec branch of the Gallente Epic Arc with Garmon and Zamone, all of us in dead space T3s. Some random people tried to kill us and we sneezed on them; killing them instantly. It was Intrepid Crossing. I had assumed I was a leet pvper, but garmon explained to me that IRC is just really really really bad. 
---
for ship fits i usaly look up active alliances on zkill and look at there loesses, and for solo pvp i do the same

Hopefully this inspires a better use of punctuation.

Unless you're unlucky you can often go months without having someone roll into you while sieged. People losing dreads while krabbing are usually either being lazy or stupid unless they get particularly unlucky.
---
HaHAA
---
Depending on setup you can enable input broadcasting to specific sets of characters. Meaning you can have a fleet going on group A and cloaky campers on group B.
---
Lol, they dropped a fax 20mins before we even called for dreads, sorry for trying to fight an alliance with a Corp. 
---
&gt;If anything, it sounds to me like just another goon SIG op that's looking for some recognition.
---
Remember how that escalated last time?
---
Hopefully this inspires use of punctuation.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but it looks like you're referring to the guy capri is responding responding to?
---
If so, that was some pretty long term thinking by someone to create a fake reddit account for an [init member](https://evewho.com/pilot/Just%20Damo) 3 years before he joined init.
---
Shut the fuck up Bill.
---
the average bean is using algos ratter and venture mining.
---
I guess the end result is that forcing me to do incursions to make money in this game would force me out. I have no desire to PVE like that, that's a young man's grind. 
---
It really is though, I really wish friends that I play other games with would give Eve a chance, but the learning curve is too scary for the at the start. I would love to do exploration with some frequent buddies ):
---
I’ll be your friend
---
Yeah, we lost for a reason.    
---
I had my first oneiros DD'd by a friendly titan- wasnt even a red on grid when it happened.  
---
Or maybe that was with mostly/utterly harmless. Fuckit I dunno, my crew hung with some shitty alliances \*coughsylphcoughhak*
---
You should record some small gang shenanigans with Avery Lewis, if that's your bag. Theres plenty of opportunities for that now with TEST at your doorstep. Those make for some nice videos too, especially with your editing skills :)
---
Lol, not sure if sarcastic or not XD
---
How did you get so many letters in your post smashing F1 repeatedly?
---
But then you have to record anyways when you mute to re-re-listen to the record that you recorded while re-listening to the record of the eviction.
---
meaning you will be behind by 2 hours forever now.
---
Well, apart from the part where every skin is worth sub 1 mil.
---
You guys keep bringing up this narrative thing, not me. I'm just talking about something that happened I was there for. 
---
We do plenty of that in INIT.

Haha yea, that went in an interesting direction 
---
Stain Guy has an insight I agree with. This is creating so many emotions. Am I going retarded? Have i missed him being intelligent and being a max level supposed? 
---
No, it's Stain Guy who is wrong. 
---
It's more like only half of the results were registered, all those red triangles at bottom are excess hits.
---
We don't. We won the fight. You guys, on the other hand, have been try-harding on reddit about this stuff for a while, downvoting anybody saying anything positive about what we did, and trying to act like HK was some high sec mining corp getting picked on by CODE. 
---
It's just kinda dumb, but you do you. 
---
Generally speaking if you're trying to catch someone in a malicious way you don't ping for that person to message you directly. When I saw the screenshot of the ping my first thought wasn't "He's trying to find him to boot him!" it was "Why am I looking at this screenshot?". I figured there was something internal you or Init leadership wanted to talk to him about. At worst maybe it would be asking that person to not do that anymore.
---
But a meme's a meme I guess.

We're trying to build up a guide [here](https://newedenreport.com/category/columns/fit-for-purpose/). But when in doubt, try joining 'Bringing Back Solo' channel ingame.

You might need to be cautious looking for any 'info' classed as relevant, accurate or up-to-date. It does age out.

Other than that, go try and see (and argue the point, if you spot a niche).

as long as we get the paps!
---
Totally cereal
---
He went to WANGS actually, but I'm not sure what the difference is currently.
---
The only folks talking about a "narrative" are the guys who lost. 
---
If the narrative is all you've got, hey - go for it. But it's kinda dumb.
---
They are not (and nobody is) saying that you shouldn't drops caps to save your krabs. They are saying the average line-members of a big null block is retarded.
---
New player, but feel it is extremely hard to find an answer to how to do certain things in the game. I google it or search an eve website and find there isn’t an answer that can help me. 
---
Example: how to attack? How to find a citadel? How to fly my ship? 
---
I didnt until you just said that 
---
Unsure if this counts

The guys who didn't defend their home are defending "the narrative" on reddit because of something something grr INIT hat Pando.

Wew
---
Love the one guy who just resubbed for this and thought it was great. I guess he took a break again...

I don't think you understand what a sandbox game is without looking it up on wikipedia.

---
All of these are answered in the tutorial at the start, did you finish it?
---
What's you in-game name? I'll message you next time I get the urge to play.
---
I found it pretty interesting - in the same way that the D-W beacon comms were super interesting. Comms are really insightful to how groups think, what they think (without the 20/20 hindsight), discipline and organization, etc. I listened to the first hour and while there was a lot of dead air and regular banter, some of the sections were pretty neat.
---
You live in nullsec with asset safety. You cant.
---
always amaze when I see people multiboxing, great video btw
---
...i don't know how to respond to this nonanswer
---
Do i point out that you nerds keep trying to push this amazing against the odds story at every turn, while the rest of this subreddit and the game is too ADD to care about a month later?
---
Do i point out that you "just talking about something" that you were there for in a subjective and biased POV is the definition of pushing a narrative?
---
Or do I point out that you guys are buttmad that HK didnt collapse and are fragging nerds as we speak?
---
I dunno, you tell me.
---
That's why I think it's hilarious these guys just automatically thought I was going to cut the guy's hands off because I asked him to PM me. 
---
I just wanted to know who had forced him to vote for me so I could go yell at THAT guy. 
---
Some of these WH guys have got it into their heads that because I'm a politician and on the CSM that I think I'm important, have no sense of humor, and am desperately afraid of being made to look stupid. I have no idea where they get that from, because that's about as true as your average Trump tweet. 
---
I play fucking EVE and admit it. I mean, come on. 
---
I am kiting away that s^#t - ain’t going to scram me down
---
Plenty of people (HK included) have said kudos despite the fact that you expended orders of magnitude more effort than was necessary over a comically-expanded timeline and despite the Goon blob overshadowing your work.
---
The more you harp on this "hurr-durr buttmad HK" angle the sillier you look.
---
Trouble in paradise
---
Being at 0% or 1% isn't going to make any difference. You have no velocity vector at 0 m/s so the direction you are facing is irrelevant.
---
I'd say the automod message is fine. This is a standard operating procedure for bug reports industry wide and there are many valid reasons for that.
---
I'm not so sure a support ticket is the right course of action either unless it's a very serious or critical bug (You physically cannot play or you found a way to duplicate items or something). 
---
It's entirely possible your bug could be there for *years*.

i think the last time it was calculated there wasn't even the amount of resources in eve to build it, and at current rate it would take like 3 years to get it all if buying every thing up
---
This post gave me concentrated autism.
---
This is what's amusing - you guys literally can't just say "GF" without having to qualify it. It's the equivalent of the guy who tells somebody "I'm sorry that you're upset."
---
What's silly is the fact that any time anybody in Goons, INIT or anybody else says something positive about this, it gets downvoted to oblivion - it's just funny to watch. I mean, this comment will get -20 karma in like ten minutes. I even made a joke about it while praising HK without qualifying anything to see how many downvotes it gets. 
---
Silly. 
---
We're simply telling you how we viewed it. Obviously the folks who lost don't want to accept that and would rather poo-poo it into "Y U BLOB" nonsense.  If nobody cared, this wouldn't be on the front page, and you guys wouldn't be rushing here to downvote everything any of us say. 
---
Do you honestly think everything we say is "pushing a narrative?" That's retarded. Why can't folks just share their opinions without there being some kind of dastardly spin? 
---
We don't give a shit what HK is doing now. I don't want any alliances folding, or players quitting. That they didn't collapse makes me happy. I hope they come after us, honestly. That would be fun.

Gotta learn to take the bad w/the good, friendo. Doing a thing thoroughly doesn't entitle you to glowing praise and showers of karma.
---
Also, I don't know how familiar you are with Reddit generally, but talking about karma is an instant downvote from most of us, regardless of EVE affiliation. The stink of it is pathetic.
---
nope fam in fact fuck you and your periods
---
Wait, CO2 managed to do something? o,O
---
The way this went down (I was there):
---
We saw a couple dude pop up in local, went on alert, rorq tackled.  I scanned the hole and sat on it.  They literally fed us sabres for a good like 2 minutes, then they came through the hole with probably 10 legions and 15-20 drekavacs.  This isn't a case of Brave being bads because we saved a rorqual with caps, this is a case of them having an FC that got cocky and thought he could take on Impass after giving us 5 minutes warning.
---
No, you're trying to push this narrative of a bunch of bright eyed, bushy tailed pilots who defied the odds and evicted the largest, most powerful wormhole corp. (Source: the original HK is being evicted post, subsequent eve media related interviews, and outside-of-eve gaming journalism interviews)
---
What really happened was that a really large group, supported by a really really large group, evicted a group a significantly smaller than them, tried to flex about it, and got laughed at when presented with the above facts.
---
Re: upvotes, downvotes, and reddit fuckery. The only person i now actively upvote is calmatt cause the world must see and study the physical manifestation of retardation.
---
Can confirm, *all of eve* (highsec, low, null, WH) would need to pool together and build the mats.
---
  Then someone will steal the lot and trash it for tun.
---
Didn't think so.
---
&gt; ...and cant get all ragey when its not there..
---
Hehe the concerns all around here are nothing compared to what would be if CCP would try to get rid of nullsec local.
---
D-W comms are good cause there is a drop happening, an eviction is a much slower paced thing
---
Doesnt even a book start like that? "Its been the best of Stain, its been the worst of Stain..." ? Somehow rings a bell at mine...
---
The biggest issue of say covetor vs hulk/procurer is the complete lack of tank. As in, walk away for 5 minutes and you might come back dead if there's a rat spawn.
---
oh fug time really does fly
---
CCP should make delayed local.
---
Can someone please explain how you came to the conclusion they were bots? I'm not really sure what I should be looking for here. 
---
Are you salty yet?
---
Except for the whole chatting part.
---
Does not matter if you are docked or not.  
---
That's the point - when I see these guys all downvoting every comment anybody makes, it's just silly. It stinks of try-hard. 
---
what lol?
---
Eh. Even if blues showed up i would rarely do anything. If i got tackled i usually got up to pee/ get a drink and when i came back i was either dead and podded or blues saved me. Either way 5 cal navy wasps wouldnt have changed anything. 
---
confirmed fuck that guy
---
you do realize goons run burners as well....
---
&gt;he fuck up Bill.
---
people have been meme'ing this at me going on 10 years now and I still don't know how to respond to it...

Adding: In null an odd rat-spawn can toast your lil Covetor in no time. Not even talking about capital rats, just 4 BSes let a covetors HP-display rotate like a fidget-spinner. Only 3 times though.
---
That's the difficult part, finding friends you like that have the same level of autism as you to stick with these crazy intense games you play. It's a struggle lol
---
usedto be able to, they removed that
---
Hedliner is a good dude yall be nice.
---
I don't know how many times I need to say it: nobody is pushing a narrative. We're proud of what we did. I personally don't care if anybody else is, but I think it's both hilarious and sad that every time one of our guys posts something, we get the whole Mittens-and-the-spinmaster-2000 thing. It's goofy. 
---
Constantly trying to explain "what really happened" is the narrative building and that you can't see it is hilarious. The folks driving the narrative are the ones downplaying with outside observers can tell was a pretty unique undertaking. 
---
XD
---
if you think the krabz in goons are gonna share their burner mission sheckles with others you're absolutely insane
---
Nah man you and Mack are in the same corp
---
You've never been in IM either, lol. 
---
Dude, he's a goon, a spodbrain, a politician and a lawyer. You're not going to get a straight answer, the truth, or anything halfway intelligent out of him. Downvote, laugh at his idiocy and move on. 
---
Sounds like they had an idea something might be happening, but weren’t ready to be evicted right then. 
---
Quality content as always bro
---
I guess we are at an impass then. You have your views on what happened, and I have mine. You were a line member in the aggressing party, I am an outside observer.
---
I don't think you understand what "narrative" means. What you said is also a narrative. Now, if you have a bone to pick with "propaganda," be my guest. But .. at least use the right word. 
---
The super launched and instantly re-pulled fighters like clockwork, but never shot at the people who had tackled it.
---
The smartbombers (a typically active ratting activity) sat in place for 10 minutes while getting shot, which would never happen if someone was running them.
---
The carrier launched fighters to fight back, but only ever shot the first person on grid, and auto-pulled them whenever the fighters took a bit of dps. It also sat at 0 not moving and never lit cyno.
---
who said anything about sharing?
---
I know I was just phrasing it as a question
---
Downvoting is retarded unless its a bot that doesnt add to the conversation.
---
Also calling him a goon as insulting to actual GSF.
---
Narrative can be interchanged with propaganda in this context.
---
no ones going to dick around with paying for sov and upgrades with out some kind of saftey, maybe take local away from tama and old man star for a month see how it goes
---
Correct. I'm not even sure why you're commenting, honestly. 
---
lmao kotaku.  fuck off retard
---
Wut? Have you not seen the Reddit posts since the eviction? A horde of salty WHers downvoting anything an Init pilot says... You just have to make a post that says "HK got evicted by Nullbears" and it rains W spacer salt. I'm currently in hospital because of sodium overdose. Who knew w space contained this much salt D:
---
I hear you can reimburse bug/outage related losses though.
---
Ok, so I followed the instructions and now I can get a price of launchers in Jita. But I still don't know how to pull the contents of a corp wallet. I have no experience in any of this type of programming.
---
&gt; The game design shouldn't promote AFK ISK-printing though.
---
You'd have to change an entire race (Gallente) /ship/weapons class and how it functions. CCP's been trying to nerf VNIs, Gilas, Ishtars for a long time, but players keep finding new fits to bypass those nerfs to afk rat. There's also a balance of how much CCP can nerf to a point where X ship wont be viable for a combat doctrine either. 
---
And yet they still manage to be mad.  Amazing.
---
Was there any reason for the change announced?
---
Not a fair comparison, Procurers kill more with less isk risk.
---
Plus there’s the whole PANIC thing that they get too. So bonus points
---
This is lit XD
---
It really is, I found that I'm not a huge fan of the super intense aspects of Eve after some experiences. I like the somewhat chill things like exploration and using wormholes to bring me all around different parts of New Eden and doing something different frequently, it is something I would have much more enjoyment doing with someone else, but it's hard to get someone at the same time with the same mindset.
---
Because your group losing the narrative is pretty funny to me, as well as your well intentioned but ultimately failed attempts at saving it. 
---
You're a fucking idiot
---
CCP Falcon's statements are not vague. It's limited to very specific scenarios. Outside of those, it's bannable.
---
Bullshit killing bullshit. The most powerful t1 frigate killed by the most powerful "t1" BC.
---
Gotta admire the folks that successfully go for kills to the bitter end. I was too busy myself, being shot on both of my pilots at once.
---
But on the other hand dumb line members mean content for cap piliots and possable kills for roamers 
---
I enjoy how passive aggressively salty HK is being with the "*We totally don't care, no really, we really didn't care about those three keepstars, but LOL INIT is so mad they didn't get any salt from us... so mad THEY ARE SO MAD OMG so mad... we totally didn't want those keepstars and the stuff in them lmao SO MAD INIT*!!"
---
I don't know what do say, dude. The literal only people talking about "the narrative" are you and the WHers. Nobody else cares. Certainly not me. 
---
the original post you were responding to?
---
Hittings, I've interacted with you on jabber. You're not this retarded. 
---
Pretty sure this thread as well as all the gaming journalism articles, TIS interviews, etc. disproves the "we dont care" angle.
---
That was an obvious joke
---
The palatine keepstar can not be built with the current supply of resources. Period.
---
Not only that it would be incredibly stupid vs. using the isk to purchase \~200 normal keepstars or inject &amp; purchase your own titan fleet.
---
And can put out 25-50% of a carriers DPS 
---
Since local is down, CCP will reimburse any losses the VNIs have. So as long as you think you can make enough isk to pay for the fit/drones, then it’s a good idea to go afk rat whenever local dies
---
So it's official , they are a NS group now? (I don't have a HK alt)
---
good fight,cheer!
---
Nothing ever posted here is worth a best of anything award.  Ever.
---
Yeah except this "leak" is a prime example of how to handle a ns blop evicting you
---
Eve the game is kind of shit but what you can do with that shit is what makes the it fun. Also your fellow pilots contribute alot to how you see the game.
---
That's correct , but no botter will petition a loss
---
Nice work. Solid writing, the buildup was nice. Could have used a bit more of a final punchline though. Something about batphoning GOTG for help maybe?
---
Doubt it. If it was a brit he's become fairly active. 
---
not that i recall. they removed a bunch of things around teh same time. the walkin captians quarters, ship trails may have been removed around that time too (added back in now), in game music player, in game web browser, and a few other things
---
loved listening to this. I particularly enjoyed each time someone came up with a bright idea (someone drop a smartbombing something on them, or lets take petes out on them!) and a smarter person would shoot it down. I would love to hear when it actually dawned on them, that "Yeah, we are toast here".
---
Please apply directly to Headliner
---
LOL
---
oh you obviously have no idea how burners work lol
---
but then you might accidentally ban the RMT buyers and rental alliance holding toons
---
Linking kotaku lol
---
And pings about people reddit accounts? That's fineable too?
---
We actually don't charge tax, our rental rates are on the alliance description. Hence, if you find any bots, and kill them, then report them.
---
chinese ≠ FRAT
---
Well they still live in a wormhole, just one with a nullsec static for all the dank whaling content. I can hardly blame them, considering we did the exact same thing following our hackviction a few years back and null content does make for a breath of fresh air from the standard wormhole armour meta. In our case we eventually got bored of the null content and have always been a C5 corp at heart so make a return to that space after about 4 months. Only time will tell if HK will feel the same way.
---
Ich liebe es ;)
---
Yeah just uses way too much P4s to ever get made
---
it's 400 Normal Keepstars
---
&gt;  It stinks of try-hard. 
---
As do the posts getting downvoted. Bit of pot &amp; kettle here...
---
I'm just telling you that once you make the allusion or direct reference to karma or votes or whatever, a nontrivial number of *your own side* joins in on the downvoting.
---
You mean faction warfare?
---
Confirmed, Awoxer, Seducer, Lover of young women, he's the devil !
---
Be aware of that guy !!!!!
---
Nope, that was legit.
---
The fact that you think it's unironic is funny. 
---
What is an "elite" bean ? Blessed Beans, aka giving your API makes you "elite" ? Maybe even I have a chance to be elite and join Hedliners Toy Boy Club :(
---
You don't seem to get it. I don't care about the karma. What I think is hilarious is the fact that when these threads kick off, anything anybody says remotely positive gets downvoted. I just laugh at it every time. 
---
delay is pointless, just remove local period
---
News is news. People want to hear these stories. The kotaku article has something like 300k+ views on it. Obviously somebody thought it was interesting, even if you didn't. 
---
oh it's fake
---
Das haben wir in den 40ern vergeigt. 
---
Welcome back !
---
all I have to say is thank you CCP thats a great feature
---
I'm glad to see our herro friends are playing on tranq. Don't fuck it up like serenity plz.
---
Open a sheet that'll be the corp wallet contents. Pick a cell that'll be easy to find (say A1 for example), and keep that blank. Move to the next column (B1) and type this:
---
=corporations_corporation_wallets_division_journal(A1,getMainCharacter(),-1)
---
The A1 in that string tells it to look at cell A1 (that one you 'reserved', if you want a different cell because you want to put headers or whatnot, that's fine, just change it in the string there, too).
---
Now, in that reserved cell - A1 in our example - you type a number that tells it which wallet division to look up. So you type 1 and it loads the master wallet, 2 and it's the second wallet division, so on. If you're trying to do a profit/loss analysis on another sheet that'll call off the wallet, and have multiple wallet divisions to use for it, I'd replicate this on another sheet for each division so they can all the active at the same time, but it's going to slow down if it's trying to load like 10 wallet divisions. Sometimes it won't auto-update on the sheet just because of load, so if you want to force a refresh, just change the number in A1 to 0, then back to your wallet division number.
---
That'll get you a page in your document with a live corp wallet transactions view. From there, it's a lot of vlookups to 'pull' the relevant information into your standard worksheet, but that's normal not-eve-specific spreadsheeting.
---
Sooooo you do give a shit about the narrative your group has built and what people say.
---
regardless version... they always keep Stalin...
---
People don’t think it be like it be, but it do.
---
*"pretends" to be retarded
---
"Oh man what a fucking retard"
---
"Haha jokes on him i was merely pretending"
---
Jack's back. HMU we'll have an old fashioned jack off.
---
Yeah all those HK dudes who never show up to Reddit are now magically downvoting you.
---
Brisc, talk to your line members about whether they feel evicting HK from Rage was worth it, not the Reddit community. If your line members are happy then why bother with this nonsense arguing about “narrative” at all?
---
Yeah, the market is a little saturated there alright, and you get so many of them if you're doing it regularly. But I see them as extras, the straight isk reward and the three BPCs are the real earners, and the BPCs are the ones benefitting from that scarcity.
---
You surly are retared
---
&gt; three keepstars
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks, glad to be back
---
Much appreciated 
---
I'm glad I could provide. Hopefully there will be more in the future, content willing.
---
Thanks for the kind words. I'm happy to be back :)
---
Why thank you. I appreciate it.
---
3/10 pvp but he's a living Eve encyclopedia and can spend hours helping new people.
---
Das war Italien und Japan. 
---
Of course they're happy with it. 
---
I'm a fucking line member. I post on reddit because I like to post on reddit. I'm not trying to diplo or "drive a narrative" or any of that other nonsense. I don't know why folks can't understand that.
---
You've posted a kotaku multiple times in this thread trying to big up your "achievement", and this somehow means you don't care about the narrative? 
---
The cognative dissonance on display here is flat earther levels of retarded. 
---
*Now* I'm a bit confused, yes. You don't care about the karma, but you've exchanged a hundred-odd words w/me about precisely that. That seems contradictory.
---
Regarding that third sentence; HK dudes *in this very thread* have said positive things about your efforts and received upvotes.
---
To cut to the heart of this: what do you expect from HK, or from other wormholes, or from the anti-blob brigade, or from F1 pushers beyond the Imperium's circle of influence? Unalloyed plaudits?
---
You don't *deserve* unalloyed plaudits. Your logistics and control folks did damn-fine work and then the rest of you turboblobbed the piss out of some dudes. Credit where it's due, friend, and laffos too.
---
I literally do not care what anybody says about what we did. I know what we did, and my colleagues who were with me know what we did. If you some random highsec dude doesn't think what we did was a big deal, it has zero impact on my opinion. 
---
Don't forget to link the "no i trollllll" meme. 
---
If I'm not mistaken, the difference gets bigger when boosts are applied to it. 
---
You get on the juicy stuff like r64 moon rocks where what you're mining is worth 2-4k+ isk/m3 that difference of just 4.6 m3/s adds up fast. Call it 4.5 m3 difference. 4.5*60*60*3000=~5mil isk/hr more. And if you're not just some basic carebear you've got say 5 barges/exhumers plus an orca/rorqual? An extra 30mil or more per hour isn't a bad improvement imo
---
&gt; I literally do not care what anybody says about what we did.
---
&gt;If you some random highsec dude doesn't think what we did was a big deal, it has zero impact on my opinion.
---
Why do you post so much on reddit about it then?
---
My merc miner is in a covetor. Haven't lost one yet. If rats come in, he just warps up to a ping. If neuts are close in intel, he warps to station. I think it's gotten into half armor once, but usually even if i'm spacing watching netflix or something, you have plenty of time to get out.
---
Why do I post on reddit so much period? Because it's something to talk about. 
---
It's not contradictory. I'll talk to anybody for as long as the convo keeps going. I don't care about the karma, what I care about is the brigade voting like that matters. Apparently to these guys it does. 
---
All of the positive comments are always hedged. It's like a rule. 
---
They don't need to give us unalloyed plaudits. Just a "hey, good fight, see you next time" would be more than enough. Capri has done that, that's about it. And to be clear, I'm not mad or otherwise expecting we get that shit. I just think it's funny when folks seem legitimately hell bent on not letting us have some fun. 
---
Blah blah turboblobbed blah blah. /eyeroll
---
I care
---
I post the kotaku thing because it's funny to post it. 
---
You guys are all seriously mad about me posting and that makes me laugh. I mean, you guys keep responding to it - it's great. 
---
so fax bait best bait?
---
Why’re you angry at me?
---
If you like posting on Reddit then post on Reddit. I’m just saying that engaging in debates about “narrative” if your line is happy is a way to end up making dumb mistakes that piss people off. You end up upset and say something you may not mean or in a way that doesn’t come out well. If your line is happy then you have zero reason to engage in it. You can say you’re not trying to drive a narrative but comments like “narrative is all you’ve got since you lost” really cuts the effectiveness of “I’m not trying to drive a narrative” down.
---
Also, sorry, you’re CSM now, playing the “I’m just a line member” card sounds a bit hollow regardless of how true it is.
---
So you act like a retard cause you think it's funny, and then when people call you retarded you say "lol jokes on you I was only joking". 
---
Okay mate. 
---
No - I'm amuse myself watching you guys keep repeating the same stupid shit and dancing the exact same tune every time I post things. It's hilarious. You should try it. 
---
Those weren't removed at the same time. I forget when in-game support tickets were removed but the jukebox was ages ago, the web browser was mid 2016, the captains quarters were removed mid 2017.
---
Being on CSM has nothing to do with my roles within my alliance and corp. I'm just a line member. I don't have any responsibility or power. I show up in fleets. I rat. I have fun. I'm literally just a line member and that's how I like it.
---
And I'm not angry at you, either. We're just having a conversation.
---
Like I said, just because I happen to have an opinion and am willing to share it doesn't mean I'm trying to drive a narrative. We don't need to do that. Narratives are for the guys who lost - literally. You don't need to spin victory. 
---
Good bot. 
---
Where can I buy these 12k volley bombers?
---
Mate if you didnt care then we wouldnt be having this conversation. You do care, a lot, about your and your group's image and narrative of events.
---
You always get a straight answer from me. You guys are not worth wasting good spin on. 
---
You keep missing the point.
---
Well RMT buyers should be banned.... 
---
Not much, but my comment still isn't wrong, so a darkness fanboy should probably not be too loud.
---
PRIMARILY, you dumbass. Learn how to read 
---
Do you know why I asked him to PM me? Hint: I've told people multiple times in this thread, and it has nothing to do with "teh narrative."
---
What are you even drinking.
---
Everyone gets into horde, you can make a alt called "horde awok alt" and get into horde, of course they have a higher number of spies than other alliances, there are also probably a huge amount of players that only played a few days then gave up. This is facts, not narrative.
---
LOL, I think you're the one missing the point, bro. 
---
I never said you weren’t a line member. I told you what it looks like when you say it. I’m a fan, you don’t have to sell me.
---
And you sound angry. You sound defensive. That’s my point. Again, I’m a fan and I mostly couldn’t care less about if HK got evicted from Rage though I do feel some sympathy towards them for having imperium come in and stomp down their hard work.
---
Also you are fully free to have whatever opinion you like, and to express it within the rules of the community. I’m not trying to tell you what you can and cannot do. I’m trying to tell you as someone that likes you, and who is on the sidelines for this fight, that the whole conversation is a bad path of land mines.
---
But you do you. No need to listen to my advice. No need to sell me. I dream daisy dreams where the North trades Sort and Dorkness. for INIT but it doesn’t seem destined to happen. I only brought it up as friendly advice and you’re welcome to discard it.
---
But again,
---
&gt; You don’t need to spin victory.
---
Then why are you engaging here? The only two things to do in this chain are spin and shit on HK and neither are good looks for the victor.
---
No CONCORD communications should be able to be maintained in the player wilds of sov except by structure deployment and a fucktonne of fuel in maintenance.

---
This is the problem with writing on the internet. You can't get tone from writing. Like, somebody sees me use profanity and assumes I'm mad, when that's just really how I talk. I'm not mad at all. 
---
The only reason I'm engaging here is that it amuses me as a way to pass the time. I think it's funny when these guys get really bent out of shape for no reason. I'm weird that way I guess. 
---
I hope they shut down the servers specifically to kill the circlejerk of the blobs.
---
Yeah cant forget about Brisc
---
OK, yeah, I absolutely don't get what you're trying to say now. What is the fun that you're being deprived of? You already dunked HK in their home hole.
---
^(... is it upvotes?)
---
wrt turboblobbing: I'm in Horde! We turboblob as much as you lot, but I don't expect updoots for it, or gfs from whomever we blob.
---
except this is the comms of when the eviction is first kicking off - this is them trying to get intel, trying to figure out what they have, mass logging things in, talking about where to stage things. I find the thought process and discussion matter pretty neat.
---
I was actually. My character name was: Major Puss.
---
I sold the toon but I tried ratting in Querious. Then I tried mining in delve. It sucked. If you check I was in IM until after the eviction. I also sold the toon on the bazaar. 
---
Leadership is what allowed snuff to be what it is... And that almost exclusively goes toward Hy and Tau. Shadow Cartel and EE both had capable members but what killed them was a lack of leadership

You guys should go evict Lazerhawks with the turboblob. 
---
I get it. And you’re dead on about tone in text. That’s why I was trying to tell you want a random passerby saw as he scrolled through.
---
&lt;3 brisc you still got at least one northerner voting for you.
---
First time I bridged was a blops run where I was flying a bomber and got to drop torps on a couple BS. Everything about that fleet was insanely fun. Cloaky/covert ops/bombing is some of my favorite shit to do. 
---
I'm still holding out hope to one day see a new covert frigate designed for small scale pvp get added to the game (like a cloak frig or dessy that fits small size weapons and meant for frig-cruiser sized pvp)
---
Well, seeing as how noone here can read minds, we can only take the quote in the context of the situation, from which we can form our own conclusions. Furthermore, you have more to lose by having that ping mean exactly what we think it means, so it's natural for you to backpedal and insist that it didn't mean what we all think it does.
---
Unpopular opinion: Rorq needs nerfed to fill the role of a **support** vessel, and exhumers could use a buff to make the cost worth it, and to fill the gap between current Rorq m3/s and barges/exhumers, without making one exhumer a miniature Rorq.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Can you jam a sieged rorq? I'm pretty sure they get a hella strong ecm resist while sieged.
---
&gt; you can tell that they're like legit upset beyond the salt. 
---
I don't see that personally; downvoting something doesn't take much effort. But hell, maybe some of them are! Some folks probably invested a lot (personally) into Rage, after all. That, and there's the history of it.
---
LZHX unanchored their keeps, if you didn't notice; only fools will horde assets in jspace now.
---
there's a few ways to access it, as the pirate arcs were designed so players could fix their standings with pirate factions. pretty sure there's a way to start it with some sort of amarr standings.  Probably all on a wiki page somewhere. 
---
CCP UIEX LUL
---
yes there is some timing involved, rorq pilots cycle down as they are finishing a rock, but if sieged I don't know if you could jam it.
---
You got a little bit of green on your kb
---
I was sarcastically pointing out that test has spies too, but apparently that whooshed right over your head.
---
How is making local non-instant propagation (a single, arbitrary function of wh space's plethora of additional mechanics) even remotely like "making nullsec like wh space"
---
9.9995 times out of 10 you're not going to tackle a rorq while it cycles down between a rock though so... This is kind of a pointless tidbit.
---
Well maybe if you guys did weird stuff, like not form alliance wide, we’d be able to tell.
---
the mission subforum is actually kinda decent for that. That said there's a few people that don't really know what they are talking about but talk a lot.  The raven thread is pretty much the cookie cutter setup for years, works on just about every missile ship
---
Haha yeah it did.
---
Dorkness. Massively destroyed! Evicted from their own space! Sort in tears as his alliance crumbled!
---
That’s what happened, right?
---
I understand your anecdote/example, but I'm not sure what point you're trying to make is. Is it that because you didn't fight back / don't respond that's typical behaviour of most players? 
---
Also, would counter by jabbing finger at # of VNI/Tengu/Rattles I've killed over the years, and the vast majority (99%+) fighting back, even a token effort. I never thought less of them for it, and it was sometimes successful in forcing me off -- or even killing me! It is exceptional/bizarre for someone to do absolutely nothing but sit and die.
---
It's absolute rubbish as a player to find bots in space, as you get false-positives when hunting for players to fight, which waste your time searching for them. Real players fly same ships / do similar things, but are infinitely more susceptible to being caught which may spawn fights (as blues come to defend). Bots can't be caught. It devalues the game.
---
It's pretty much the massively cancerous 'leet PVP' WH community(barring a few cool dudes who all happen to be ex low sec corps) being collectively ragey and salty about the most cancerous of their lot getting roflstomped to the same tune they roflstomped all those much smaller and weaker than themselves(and also rolling over and dying with less E-honor and fight than most other groups in Eve whom they all bitched about not putting up enough of a fight, read whelping enough stuff to them) and now being whiny about it on the only battlefield they have left because their E-Bushido wormholer's vs all pledge completely failed to defend them from a concentrated attack. So all in all just another day in Eve. But hey, they can tell it how the want it. It's written in Eve's history now, so we'll carry on carrying on, and keep on poking the reddit bear because reading the cries of 'Blob!' and 'Poor us' are great. 
---
Wait, hold on. Stop. You're making it sound like Snuff is full of good pilots. Cut that out, don't misinform the good people of /r/eve.
---
Burner missions are those things that show up in overview that aren’t ore anomalies right?

it will be a lot easier to do with the new asteroid effects

I can't believe Vertiso still has such a massive hardon for Gobbins after all this time. He's literally dedicated every aspect of his eve career for the last ~2 years to being a Horde-harrassing shitposter. Get some therapy my dude.
---
m8 please stop posting holy shit. 
---
That would be some interesting development :D
---
sounds very rule 34?
---
Time to remove local!
---
Its safe to say that no one does eve vids like you! respect from the other side! 
---
The ingame medal system is extremely underutilized. We need another way to compare our e-dongs.

You guys had all that and managed to lose 5 bil? How? 
---
Alot of effort...im lazy

Still want high speed train from Seattle to Portland

I think fuzzworks can calculate that,  also the in game can simulate with remote structures, although I think you might have to have access to the structure to check it in game. 
---
I mean our EN wing is still growing CH is still way bigger. Its still chinese food but with less spice 
---
that's just unfair.  
---
when a lower bar, such as bombers bar or GoTG has presented itself, we haven't heard of him for months.
---
The cyno problem is easly fixed , just add ships with a fitted cyno to local immidiatly, the rest delayed.
---
Best comment during this recording: "Remember that secret santa thing..."
---
Feel free to stop reading. 
---
The far future is going to be a lot more like botting than engaging gameplay.
---
That's definitely more fun. 
---
Nobody can read minds, correct. But I am never going to lie to somebody on reddit or anywhere else just because I said something they thought was stupid. My entire intent on talking to the dude was to find out why he said that he was forced to vote for me. 
---
What exactly do I have to lose? Nobody is going to think more or less of me one way or the other. I just think it's funny this caricature that the WH guys seem to have of me. 
---
&lt;3
---
Only thing to point out, oversized cap batteries are REALLY good on cruisers now. if you have the PG available, a large cap battery will give you more regen, more cap total, and more neut resistance than two rechargers.

More proof that local should be removed!
---
Delete this.

Remove local now!

Yes, but I just got sound today so I believe I missed her telling me stuff

---
We can't fight the onslaught
---
&gt;One could also imagine low-slot modules that give your ship a secondary sensor suite. So that Loki could have a Magnetometric Auxilliary Sensor Suite fitted, and be able to spoof as a Gallente Cruiser (at the cost of having significantly reduced sensor strength while doing so).
---
I mean that sounds a bit interesting, but I don't see why someone would do that. Maybe try and bait? I'm not sure.
---
I really would like to see the standard directional scanner be given a shake up. I'm not a fan of how every single ship has the same speed, strength and scope. Maybe some ship classes could have stronger ones, some faster sweeping, some more precise. A lot of options to help give incentives to fly a broader range of ships.
---
I really, really would love for local to have the same delayed effect we see in wormhole space. It would be great if CCP just did a month of that to see how the players feel about it. It would add some unknown excitement as well as shake up how people go about ops, NPC type activities as well as PvP. The bots of course would hate every second of that month. lol

You created this caricature of yourself through your own actions.
---
Regarding your intent, I refer you to my above post (again).
---
What do you have to lose? I dont know, this carefully crafted persona you built on imaginary internet points and approval from online acquaintances? Again, i dont know why you are the way you are. That's between you and your creator.
---
Also, this is reddit. Everyone lies, all the time. 4Chan has (or had, its been at least a decade since I visited) a disclaimer stating that all posts there are works of fiction and only a fool would take them seriously. I feel like this is an implied one here.
---
What other thread? 
---
mispelt "adapting and overcoming"
---
They use screen scraping/OCR software to monitor the local chat list, if they detect someone not friendly to them they warp to safety.
---
Because the local chat channel was broken, the bots had no way of knowing who else was in the system, so they would just sit there and wait to be killed.
---
Well, I'm apparently the only person who doesn't lie on reddit. I don't have any reason to. 
---
The caricature was created by and exists only in the minds of the WHers and guys like you apparently. You can choose not to believe me, and that's fine, but I'm telling you I don't have any reason not to be truthful. 
---
Carefully crafted persona? I'm just being myself. 
---
I used to love the heavy armor fights but it got to the stage were it took too long that and my scrams ability to pointo ut to 45+ km on a 13km scram (d-sync) made them get old pretty quick.

Back in the day the Hulk cost 92 million ISK and had 3 pylons.
---
With the right skills, a fleet boost and the right guys, you'd strip mined a belt so fast you sometimes had the idea it hadn’t been there at all. It was definitely worth it to have it.
---
Sure, if someone shows up in local, the entire crew warped out to the POS, but when you did have an extended mining opportunity the yield was phenomenal. You could produce huge amounts of ore in not a lot of time.
---
yeah that's what he said
---
Oh yes this definitely seems like a very reasonable and well thought out criticism. 
---
Well it's nice that there is a high level conflict driver now on the grid, however Rorquals have removed almost all the small-med scale conflict drivers for day to day combat. Assuming a competent pilot you need Capitals or 60-100\~ dudes to kill Rorquals, and even then if they use Panic, light cyno before inhib and are in comms within 7LY of a big alliances staging it's fairly likely they'll survive. Outside of specific super costly whaling ships like Leshaks that get wrecked by any competent alliance response, they are out of reach of solo, small gangs and most flash form gangs you can put together even in large alliances. New Eden gets a decent fleet battle maybe once a week involving defense fleets to Rorqual, otherwise it's mostly just people who are incompetent dying. 
---
The negative is that we've traded once a week flashy headline battles over Rorquals for a significant decrease in kills on mining barges and exhumers, a lot of solo/small gang targets have disappeared, with ratters flying Carriers, and Miners in Rorquals, the amount that a solo, small group or drunk roam can accomplish has diminished significantly. This has seen a decrease in solo/small gangs/drunk fun roams, and also as a consequence, has seen a decrease in the need of roaming defense fleets, also because of meta ships involving light cyno, teleport fleet from staging. The end result is there are less solo/small gang targets for defense fleets, there are less defense fleets for other gangs to engage, the amount and worth of Junior FCs has decreased, and we're seeing a brain-drain in eve imo. As burned out FCs/Content Creators and personalities leave, they are not being replaced due to the current meta.   
---
I think Rorquals have contributed heavily to the current "Play other games, wait for ping" culture.   
---
There were absolutely mines in eve.  I have bps for python mines still.  Unfortunately they caused  incredible amounts of lag and had to be removed.

you mostly want to avoid items with a 5% volume of 1 as that typically indicates they don't sell much. Often you will see a bunch of junk items topping the isk/lp value as they just don't trade much so the price can go very high. Typically the higher the 5% volume the more stable the prices. 
---
totally agreed :)

"40 mill"

This was one of the most fun weeks I have had in the game. Great vid. Great flying with you. 
---
My brain had a hard time parsing the title. Portland, or perhaps we should meet-up someplace else?
---
One of the most fun weeks I have ever had in the game. Great vid....and great flying with you. 
---
&gt; Given that, how exactly would it make sense to bribe the local police to ignore you shooting them?
---
Well you would pay one police officer to ignore you while you shot another police officer. It's not that strange, since this used to happen in quite a few south american countries.
---
I honestly don't even care who is being propaganda'd, I will always upvote this gif. It's just so... Eve.
---
Now that we don't have leg in fights, not laggy local chats, can we put them back in?
---
They had really funny mechanics with Concord. Used to trigger mines in null when you know the guy who anchored them was in high sec and it would Concord them... eve was a silly place

EVE is not about making or spending ISK. It's not about efficiency. It's about comparing dicks...

lv3s a legion should dunk, I think a proteus will be the best for that thanks to the warp speed sub but that's really kinda a very niche thing. 
---
Seyllin in a Stratios, going out fighting General Tso like old times

Just start over. Play the tutorial again, tryvthe new player experience in the agency window

It helps to have a sense of humour when playing a game like EVE. Well, in general, it helps to have one.
---
Sounds like exactly what we need right now.
---
The minigame is buggy. If you click a node and nothing happens don't click again. Wait a minute so you dont lose 40 coherence due to lag! 
---
We are classy in Catch... Impass is a Trammel map and no PVP is allowed what-so-ever, infact, we are petitioning CCP to make it so Impass is highsec but any roamers who come in are suspect by default. Not even 2 month old Catalysts are going to go without supers being dropped on them btw.   
---
Remember to go to Catch for your prearranged fights, and leave our Trammel map Impass alone. Thanks. 
---
Bummer. You got two replies saying opposite things. Noone knows whose right! 
---
That's funny, most nights I see a LOT of covert ops folks in my Delve space, trying to blow up excavators. Most are small gangs. I disagree, I feel the Rorqual has continued a heavy involvement in getting all these black ops small gangs very excited.
---
there are plenty of npc stations you can live in if you cannot do what is necessary to defend your fort
---
It's ok guys. I whored on our fort so killboard is still green.
---
what if i told you hulks outmine rorqs 
---
going monthly faster than an ill considered web comic.
---
That's out future CSM rep!!
---
Its kind of amazing that a game that's entire economy is based around shooting rocks even managed to get this far tbh
---
Other mechanics aside, the last thing we need is more of a defenders advantage 
---
i would recommend find your own, because play style vary a lot and you will find out what to expect from opponents if ship is fitted in certain way. 
---
few general tips, - 
---
always use mvd (easier to catch someone and escape blob) . 
---
don't use implants if you are poor
---
use boosters like exile, drop(they could easy turn lose into 2-3 kills) . 
---
If you are brawling always use scam+web, if you are kiting always use disruptor +defensive web\\scam
---
overheat is super important for both kiting abd brawling, train that skill asap.
---
My personal favorite,-
---
For armor brawl - dual rep vexor with blasters (one med\\one ancill rep)  , dual rep full neut VNI , hull tank\\dual rep ENI with blasters . thorax is great with both dual rep\\ passive hull\\passive shield tank and blasters for sure
---
For skam-kite ,- ashimmu , rail vigilant (requires some skill)
---
For shield brawl,- passive\\active moa. or ASB moa, depends on your favor . SFI for both passive \\ ASB fit (you can use SFI for kite, but ONI is better just because of missile speed).
---
For kite ,- ONI with rapid light .  
---
So goons are halfway there already?
---
Maaayyybbbbbeeeeeee how do i remember this is happening in a month?
---
Wow. How did they manage to feed that much?
---
Pointless task. They have so many bugeatures to fix this year. Something that saves the player 1 click must not be a priority.
---
Fly torp bombers and command dessies that boosh them. 
---
The end.
---
that doesn't make sense as most comic books are monthly...
---

How many times ccp said they don't want to draw a line in the sand? They did here and now they're in a sensibke spot because:

&gt;Input Broadcasting &amp; Input Multiplexing

&gt;Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing refer to the multiplication of inputs, actions and events to multiple instances of the game.

And

&gt;Input Automation remains strictly prohibited, and is policed under our suspension and ban policy

&gt;Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing of actions with consequences in the EVE universe, are prohibited and will be policed in the same manner as Input Automation

You should go rage on World of Tanks’ forums, they had the audacity to recreate all the tanks from WWII and then some, which according to you is basically like starting another holocaust.

yeah, or 200 normal keepstars and the titan pilots/titans to defend them.

it makes sense to a grown man who hasn't read comics since 1997 aaay.  also stop making posts.

yeah, for sure. It's also how they help HK track their rental empire. You can take your pick! Rent a C6 from HK and make that dank isk, or pay Hawks to have access to all the wormholer chains on tripwire! They'll definitely give you public access for the right amount ;) Pretty sure they only take payment up front though, you'll have to work out the details. Probably be like 20 billion isk for 4 hours access or something else reasonable. 
---
Also, if you find a suitable C6 that you end up renting or a good chain from your initial payment, I'll take a finders fee of 10% off whatever you make. Thanks!

He sometimes brings a few of them together and bombs excavators, but clearly he is a man of honor and despite the obvious and blatant example of him broadcasting inputs to his clients, he turns it off and manually controls all 5 bombers at a time.

Imagine attempting to be this witty about something of which you possess so little understanding.  It wasn't my fortizar so #nosalthere, but if your opinion is that anchoring a fortizar in lowsec *away* from wherever snuff is located at the time will make it safe, you're gonna have a bad time. Do you think snuff was staged in the region when the fort went down?  These snuff guys have these big ships with which you may not be familiar - they're called capitals. These things are equipped with these things called "jump drives", which lets em move around quite a bit. This is to say nothing of the fact that snuff has caches of sups all over the place, and their members actually understand how to use jumpclones.

AOE weapons tend to not work well in EVE in regards to performance. This is especially true in big fights that create TIDI, there are numerous cases when AOE weapons (successful bombing runs, titan bosons, maybe even lots of smartbombs could do that) is the tipping point and just crash the server node all together.
---
Imagine being up in the middle of the night spewing salt instead of sleeping to take of business the next day. You have a lot of issues dude. You probably need to take a break from this game and get yourself evaluated psychologically.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in EVE University, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Guristas relic sites, and I have over 300 confirmed rental payments. I am trained in blob warfare and I’m the top F1 machine across the entire CONDI renter forces. You are nothing to me but just another local spike. I will report you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this intel channel, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across Anoikis and your seed is being logged in right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The freighter seed that I've had in your wormhole since the fucking Dark Ages. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be docked anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over seven hundred ships, and that’s just because wormhole ops give 2x pap links. Not only am I extensively trained in F1 and anchor up combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Goonswarm Federation and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of this wormhole, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” post was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking cynos. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

This thread was about duelling in a sandbox game. Tell me, what is the problem with people duelling in a sandbox game?

IMO here's a pro's and con's list of stopping your posting from a good-posting perspective:
---
PRO: My eyes would no longer bleed from reading this
---
CON: I wouldn't get to make 1/2 assed posts decrying OP's like this
---
Either way.. your post is a toxic dumpster fire moment in r/eve right now.
---
Thank you Pando. Very cool
---
Shitposting is my therapy 💁‍♂️
---
Came here to say this
---
In Horde we mine in big fleets, with some Newbeans bringing a venture abd other people bringing a porpoise, a miasmos and 6 barges it's a nice and relaxed atmosphere, we sit in comms and talk about whatever.
---
I find it much more stimulating than just semi-afk ratting in a VNI, and it's more profitable to boot. 
---
Can't argue with that
---
Wait is he the guy who stole some contract money from Horde back when they lived in Fade/PB and then ran to INIT/Goons? 
---
The opposite is true. A hundred clicks per minute necessary? Bots don't mind, players do.
---
PvE in Eve is not very exciting, and there is no reasonably easily to implement solution for it. Most real people optimize for ISK/action. If you see Gilas ratting in anoms, these are probably bots. The Gila makes a few more ISK/hour, but only if you constantly target and attack rats manually. Not worth the effort for players, but easy extra income for the bot.
---
"See something, respond to it quickly by a well defined reaction" -- that's very annoying for players, makes AFKing impossible. But it's trivial to bot. There are many such suggestions repeated several times each day - enforce using dirscan, increase drone aggro, make drones passive, ... Each of it would kill the VNI alt, which makes some money while the player is having fun on his main. Nothing of it would harm the soon updated bots.
---
con: nothing
---
Dumb feed but is this really Reddit worthy?
---
Lol.. Awesome!
---
yes, he had a big splash in INN and then cringed out a bit over the value and made a new main.  
---
seems normal really!
---
Would docking up your VNIs the moment someone enters system be considered kill denial?
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=4346,4384&amp;b=8421000,8420970&amp;e=90,120&amp;t=fv   I think it looks better.
---
This is what Snuff was about from the start. They took a little break and focused on NS for a while but now back to their Roots... Deal with it or move to HS
---
I don't see 'using chat' listed in those examples.
---
Mining for me is terrible alone. But you get a bunch of friends to talk, it's like a campfire. 6 people, drinking their drank. Someone older than the rest of you occasionally coughs and you wonder if you gonna have a weird 911 call to do. It's quite nice.

This is a great fit, but ideally you should have one of *each* crystal in there, so your turrets look like a rainbow. This gives you at least one turret that is efficient at any range.
---
Obviously use regular crystals, because they never break, and thus maximize your profits.
---
&gt;  but if your opinion is that anchoring a fortizar in lowsec away from wherever snuff is located at the time will make it safe

hello michael.
---
They may have had your site scanned already, or if not what most people do is narrow down your location by warping around and using dscan, then they drop probes out of your dscan range, move them to where you are and scan once to get a hit. So the probes will only be on your dscan for about 7-8 seconds. 
---
The sabre also most likely had hyperspatial rigs fitted, so again unless you’re hitting dscan every two seconds, he’ll be on top of you before you know it. 
---
LMAO
---
oddly enough i find mining more fun than ratting, i may be retarded
---
What? Didnt know it could do that
---
Depending on your skills, a procurer fit for yield can outmine a retriever fit for yield... Because of mining drones.
---
Now, *technically* a retriever can fit a full flight of mining drones and outmine a procurer. Only technically because unless you've got someone else to guard it, that retriever can't fit a flight of 5 light combat drones and 5 mining drones, whereas a procurer can.
---
... And given a procurer can be tanked easily even without sacrificing yield, I think the better of the two is obvious.
---
Then again, if you're going to afk mine the retriever has a much larger ore hold... I don't recommend doing that, in my experience you'll wake up dead.
---
Cheeeeeeeerrrrzah. vert it’s like you really know me brav!

Hello jamal 'bad post' bulgruuf

You should be able to run through it again with a new character. Embrace those three character slots :)

They left because your toxic risk adverse cunts who have zero interest in the game as a whole other than beating your chest whilst admanant your not a Goon Pet..
---
I was referring to both moon and anomaly mining. But, in my opinion, rock size is dependant to the security status of the system the rock is, which mean since wormholes are always -1.0., they’ll have the biggest rocks, as paired with nullsec.
---
There were mines in Eve yes, i used them and Krulldari overused them in Venal in the venal war vs J0kers and M0o. Will never forget the minefield of about 1500 mines he did drop around a gate once, cause if you landed on one, you sure bounched on to next one and so on, so they were fun to use, you loded them into launchers on any ship that could fit launcher.
---
Used to do that in highsec in eve uni, it is chill af.
---
I mostly use the procurer/skiff because in null you'll find that loki/stealth bomber will easily wipe out a covetor in a few hits as will anom rats. At least with the tankier ships it gives you time to warp your pvp alt into the belt, apply reps with the Rorqual (in which case, you're usually mining mercoxit anyhow so need the tank) and if necessary, call for back up on comms. The mining barges/exhumers serve the purpose in Nullsec of either additional ore to your rorqual OR as your mercoxit miner (for T2 production). The latter gives the most profit. I've found the Skiff of the most use for this purpose. It can tank belt rats no problem whilst still giving great ore and can be protected by the Rorqual.
---
Still got all your timers set in AUTZ?
---
Yeah you can start with a Minmatar agent in Egbinger or an Amarr agent in Sendaya if you have I think its standings for L4 missions?
---
Been a while but IIRC most of the rats are Sansha and Concord and they're just normal missions, your standings won't affect anything beyond where you can start it.
---
Have an upvote you alpha male
---
Nice, thanks ! 
---
Something that could be interesting is to manufacture T2 XL guns. They weight enough to fit multiple in a DST, and could be easier to do than the others.
---
This meme is really dated and not funny since 2017. downvoted. Thanks for the low effort post
---
I'm interested, therefore by your logic he is allowed to post.
---
lol you his jizz rag or something? Or just defending him with a raging boner for a faggot who sits on 60 accounts a day brigading that he totally still has a life? 
---
I made the point long ago that barges need a rework, and we don't need so many 'different' types. Also filling up your ore hold in 4 minutes flat is a joke.
---
Maybe he doesn't like to pew pew. I don't either - of course, I find mining equal parts frightening due to sitting on a rock in space and boring due to sitting on said rock in space.
---
I'm sure you and OP probably think the idea of getting paid to move someone *else*'s stuff through space in a tin can with a kick me sign on the back to be equal parts boring and frightening as well.
---
That's fine, we all find our ways to make isk.
---
I think the perfect solution for you would be to join Karmafleet (which requires three alliance participation fleets per quarter only) and then join Gooniversity. It's much more comprehensive and up to date and classes are great. Eve wiki seems to be becoming dated.

"GOTG are 3rd partying on the Goons side, because of what we did in Branch"

Why are you such a bad poster? Literally everything you post is low effort trash 
---
I see this as a way the people of this subreddit want to troll the mods - but as it will reviewed by them this will be changed.        
---
Yet it is funny. 
---
It's because in Delve, if you bring anything too big to be noticed, you get the complete Thetasquad hammer dropped on your head. We don't like people messing with our industrialists. There's still plenty of our pvp'ers hunting their small gangs/soloists going on when it's overt game play so that's very much alive. However, the blops game in Delve space has reverted to messing with our mining drones because that's all they can do and live (since our response times can be within seconds these days). That said, the Rorqual still acts like sugar that attracts the ants... and there's no end of small gang blops operatives coming to find that sugar. Thus the rorqual is producing content for both sides.
---
Cus were the one's who keep bringing it up clearly
---
As you're approaching the Ravens for that warp, you move from ~155km away to ~138km away - are you sure your fleet wasn't just too close to warp?
---
He still owns me a good propaganda piece ^(not that i didn't bribe him to write one)

I can't thank you enough
---
Hunting ratters is not PVP, it's seal clubbing. Jumping 1 guy, with 10 guys isn't fair nor "healthy" game play. It's EVE.  EVE isn't about fair. The fact is when you stroll into a big nullsec block, you're walking into thousands of peoples homes. Homes they have spent a long time setting up infrastructure/defenses/etc in. The one issue I see is simply that the resources are a never ending fountain, and due to the removal of differences in regions. There is no reason to take one area of space from anyone else. 
---
The MER is actually fine, when you bother to look at how many people live in delve, and break it down into a per capita number. Once you do that you realize that the north actually rats more than the south, and the south mines more. The real issue, is that 40k players live in a single region with 140 systems. Delve should be a barren wasteland at this point, devoid of any resources. Forcing them to move on, and secure other areas. 
---
Did that in provi on an alt for a while, it's a nice way to look at the game from a different side
---
Nah I was hitting the button long before that.  i recycled probes before warping to a different thing. The bug is whatever it happens now and again, it was a mistake on my part because theres other things i could have done, I was just explaining what happened for people who were curious.
---
...and you need the  Hunter’s Quiver skin for the Maller ... or it won´t look pink!!!
---
You know what, this was the propaganda vid that won last year for me.

It was perfect and perfectly timed. Any explanation would devalue this thing.  It was prefectly timed to bring Imperium and Legacy together to fight those comming for them.

Well I mean all the Chinese bots spam local to make it look like there's  really people there.

We should have those ''the purge'' events every months for a substitute for ccp's incompetence at punishing bots.
---
What do you think economy should be based on other than industry? Flowers, kudos?
---
I am cool with that, as long as ot is entertaining and engaging, which it isn't at this point.
---
That could be a thing to nerf the rorqual power: mines that you put into mining rocks and that blow the excavators.
---
You would be able to demine a rock by using a special module but that would take some time.
---
&gt; and at current rate it would take like 3 years to get it all if buying every thing up
---
Not just that, it will crash the market big time and spike all prices. $1.35m won't pay for this structure.
---
Exactly, and that was another reason why they got removed. You mine a gate and kill people without even being online

Why are goons (And bastion??) listed in this picture, you know they're blue to TEST right?
---
They existed, but they had two major problems: 
---
1. Concord would flag and kill you whenever anyone hit a mine you had deployed even if you were nowhere near it.
---
2. People mined their space more than the Bajoran Wormhole which caused a whole bunch of lag and stupidity
---
Still not banned?
---
neck urself(in game)
---
I doubt typing in local changes anything (with the exception of wormholes) that would have a noticable impact on Eve Gameplay. Especially since half the time local is pure cancer and the other half of the time broken.

Really makes one wonder why it's in the game if CCP was going to go out of their way to make it unbuildable.

Dude, I was in INIT, loved it, still think great of people there, but seriously the whole chest beating during and after the eviction was really unnecessary. INIT does great when fighting as the underdog against great numbers in NS. That you guys over estimated the answer you would get from WH and blobbed is fine but the over the top braging was really not the best PR move here.
---
but we aren't

ofc I'm biased but this year we made the news with a bunch of feats and memes, including the GOTG titan save op, the Rage eviction, the war in the north, and many more. 
---
Yes.

Where exactly is the part where horde f*cks us? 🤔😏

&gt; honestly i wouldn't be too torn up if players like you quit. i wouldn't be sad if all the toxic elements of every gaming community quit.
---
You are an even bigger moron as I actually thought. 
---
Pando, I really loved flying with you, but why trying to put the knife back in your own liver. INIT has handled the PR regarding the eviction really poorly and you just should really lay low and stop trying to defend your actions. You overestimated and blobed, that's sad but it happens, just go over it.

Is hunting hulks that more engaging than hunting excavators?

I'd rather see mining fleets with the odd rorqual back too, though.

I mean, yeah, you dropped some Trig ships with a Titan, Supers and several Carriers. GGWP mate, you might one day reach PL lvl on elitism. Can't wait for the next reddit post about Brave dropping a Titan on a Retribution fleet for shit n giggles.

They can do whatever the fuck they want in their space.

They want to rat and mine and people who won't let them are shown out.

If you want to decide what the rules are you have to conquer them... That's the point of nullsec.

You should really go after beams instead, the range dictation can often put you out of range of the rats weapons, diminishing the need to repair damage constantly, and yeah stick to Standard M.

Buying the PLEX from the in-game market is the same as buying it from CCP directly, since the PLEX originally have to be bought from CCP directly either way - you're just adding a middle layer.

Im just trying to give a counterpoint to "every person that doesnt fight back is a bot" to prevent false positives. I think people who hunt ratters in general are a little self righteous and this whole bot thing is fueling their mentality of 'saving' the game.

Since you can't do much besides dscanning while in gatecloak and are probably already reported in intel a couple of jumps before i don't think it would be too strong.

Blades and LORDE are rental alliance IIRC
---
ye who is Tri again??? lol
---
But every goon fleet going out is not shooting test 
---
I don't think Pandemic Horde Inc. are really in a position to talk shit about fighting alone though y'know
---
GJ your credit card makes up for, which site do you by your plex from btw? 
---
That's not what he said.
---
Yikes someone forget there morning wank did we?
---
Uhh. Both sides have a nip until here soon. So no ones going to break an agreement. 
---
Hey at least he has his corp to brigage his posts.
---
if you tried harder you'd come across as less of a crying salty bitch baby, keep crying though I'm nearly thereeeee
---
Weren't you banned for racism? 
---
I'm not sure he gives a fuck what some kid with attention issues thinks buddy
---
VYDRA
---
Sc2 that shit
---
Frat hasn't been shy of breaking agreements before have they?
---
Let it go, if they havent done anything now they wont because of reddit
---
&gt; for your prearranged fights
---
that is what you do on coalition level or goons, what they do is the opposite and once was the thing that brought people to this game.
---
The current situation is only attracting Farmville-Casuals and making the people that made EVE great and that contributed to its promotion with community work, videos, streams etc. (unlike coalition drone 1824592) leave the game.
---
Also current situation was not reached by the great skills of someone, but by the meta changes CCP implemented that heavily favoured FarmVille-afk-Playstyle.
---
quality vid
---
lmao!!!! dang why you so angry??
---
What possible sort of advantage in EVE do you get by chatting in local on multiple chars at the same time, accidentally? 
---
Test official campaign begun saturday, so what have they done so far?
---
I think we're too far to the side of caution / conservatism than egregious banning -- thankfully. Though it's also why people are trying to be creative / give leads to those who can judge or do something about it.
---
&gt; I think people who hunt ratters in general are a little self righteous and this whole bot thing is fueling their mentality of 'saving' the game. 
---
I feel like you're jabbing me ;)
---
Didnt start when that was a thing. Was it really feasible for big fight or just kinda worthless made for gate camping?
---
Yeah, well, he spends his time griping about wanting a jump bridge, but not wanting to use the tools that CCP has provided. He should adapt.
---
only for XIX
---
ebay
---
GOLIATH ONLINE
---
Those would be perfect for a wormhole. 
---
This is very true, but we have been very careful to redesign FRT. We wont break agreements unless someone else breaks it and trust. Its not just  FRT anymore. 
---
We have coalition members and we arent going to have them suffer because we didnt keep promises.
---
i have a few questions:
---
why do you think it is skill to kill a titan with 350 people from HK?  
---
was M95 born in '95?  
---
at what year (B.C.) was this system seeded with linked capitals?  
---
could you explain me the concept of ragerolling?  
---
We did drop supers on a goon ares fleet? Does that count?
---
It has nothing to do with being elite or not. Its about sending a message - impass is not for pvp content so get out!
---
But it's your NIP? 
---
Well, they're renter tier, but they're not renters.
---
retard
---
yeah i guess do that, got nothing to lose
---
May u ask hordes ratter/miner.. @everyone Rattingfleet in 15mins.. Get in fleet now! 😬
---
Good. Throw them back over the great wall and make sure they stay there. 
---
So after the war legacy and winter formed a nip for 6 months. It hasnt passed that date yet
---
Why isnt this sticky? Mods support bots and broadcasters?
---
Winter asked for a NIP you seem to forget. On top of that you are now installing Skill Urself on your border yet again for protection, what the hell happened to the old FRT?
---
Funny ;)
---
Shit, RR Wyvern caches rumbled.
---
? think ur brain stopped mate
---
Sure it was a big mistake from ph and bl.
---
You just want more and more acounts.
---
He still used it in game, so technically it doesnt matter. It is also extremely unlikely he only used it for that.
---
So when does it end?
---
He used it in game, so there is proof.
---
Bruh, no one wants to “be” the content. It’s zero sum in this situation. Your content is their pain in the ass. That’s the mentality. 
---
thank you sir
---
Yea we arent putting skillu there but we aremt gonna stop them from dping what they are doing. If test thinks this would be crazy theyd pull back from the fight up north with horde.
---
 Nip was a cease fire ya but we still havent passed the date yet. We arent going to break an agreement. 
---
are you having a stroke?
---
Well dropping a fortizar in your sov them is pretty renter tier dude lol 
---
Concidering the number of accounts you use, is it really more profitable? Does a porp, miasmos and 6 barges beat the ticks that 8 VNIs generate?
---
With that being said, while I haven't mined in years (don't really rat either, passive income ftw), I understand the appeal
---
Now if only you redesign yourselves to not keep a botting rental empire that would be great. 
---
AAR plox

I hate to break it to you but I don’t think it was actually tethered :P

At least he is in good company.

---
Just anothrr manic monday i guess. 
---
idiot
---
Bots, Plex, RMT - it's all disgusting. 15 year vet complaining. Let's make the universe honest again. :P
---
Not only was it tethered, it was also not DD'd.
---
&gt; says stupid shit
---
&gt; downvoted
---
 Brisc: ???????
---
I wasn't in that fight but from the comms on our side I am 100% certain SC were killing Minmatar in that battle lol.
---
&gt;"Interaction with other characters"
---
It's time to ban.
---
That's just what he was caught for.
---
If test saw this as a threat theyd be back down here.
---
I run 3 accounts when mining moon ore. 2 Procurers with meh mining skills (maybe 3 weeks worth of training) and a Porpoise with good boosting skills a f T2 mining drones. I can pull in 120m an hour on an R16. When I dualbox two VNIs, one with good skills, one with decent skills, I hit about 80-90m an hour. When the moon is an R32, R64 or a jackpot, the isk/hour with my setup can go anywhere from 200-400m an hour.
---
But VNI ratting is consistent, whereas moon mining requires there to be an active moon in relatively safe space to achieve the best results. 
---
You do not remember correctly.
---
Because there is no real advantage there, we know he didnt primarily use it for that.
---
We actually already do that. Here soon well have a fun announcement about yeeting the bots away. Id love to see that from other coalitions. 
---
Did you miss their AT ad ? it was literally come mine with us, we have rorquals.  
---
I'm not joking.
---
Are you saying he used it for chatting?
---
So we are looking at a perm ban now or we know CCP protects botters. Good.
---
Rorq should be more like the porp, great for boosts but not so much mining yields.
---
The FC said all the magic words i love to hear and i miss it T\_T
---
it's a shame that 'baited on a free Hyperion' title was already used today. I feel it would fit this occasion better.
---
Just REQ things...
---
gosh, your posts have been the most consistent source of cringe on this subreddit, ever since the whole eviction thing started. 
---
AAR. 
---
I was showing someone the Keep DD as they hadn't seen it before. Targeted a tanked Super what could easily take the Keeps DD.  Had the titan out trying to sneakily Boson a Tempest that was running around earlier. Unknown to me is the titan was un-tethered (Had no Argo timer as it didn't get to Boson that Tempest).
---
DD Arcs off Super and into the Untanked Titan. With me still wondering what I actually did that caused it to stay untethered.
---
Naturally, he would NEVER screw up and say undock with broadcasting on, right?
---
No, the point is to control multiple clients as one.
---
Literally didn't know the titan died until the person I was showing the Keep DD to said it had blown up.
---
i was told that he has used it for chatting by mistake
---
Dat "hero shuttle" that made a titan get focked by it´s own people. :D
---
Welp Meme of 2019 EVE DownUnder here I come...again
---
What is his primary use?
---
That would be for CCP to investigate. Given how long it took them to ban Gaara after he fucked up I wouldn't hold your breath. 
---
Keep traing him and focus all cores navigations and wpn supports 
---
Welcome to the club
---
would have lived if it were a shield super
---
But they dont want to investigate because the answer is clear.
---
Core alliances are in Detorid, renters are elsewhere. That's the easiest way of thinking of it. 
---
for once, this statement is actually true
---
Why would they interrupt a FRX eviction? The only people currently being disturbed here is Winter co. Just funny to see what entity you haven't invited to come play border protection for you... 
---
REQ being REQ.
---
Have CCP said this somewhere or are you just making shit up? 
---
Like 6 months ago Ive calculated that hulk returns itself after 2b worth of ore. I'd die first because I'm muppet. Then I've extracted my exhumer skills.
---
what? ratting fleets have been a thing in horde for years
---
NICE SHIELD SUPER. MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE LIVED IT IT HAD SOME SHIELDS.
---
Thats not how i wanted that titan to die but i guess...ok? Cool km for the guy
---
We are?
---
You don't need a super umbrella for exploration. All you need is a tour of 10-30 systems with not too many neuts in local, especially no gatecamps, and a structure at least in every second system on the tour.
---
Exploration is very big for players with low to medium SPs. Sansha space has Brave, Test (Dreddit, Brand Newbros), Provi-Bloc. Gurista space has PL, NC. and DeadCo - a lot less players, most of them are relatively old.
---
The meta also shifted - shield fleets, shield capitals are used a lot more -- absolutely no surprise, that the Gurista relics become more and more lucrative.
---
U playing LoA yet?
---
AAR: Progodlegend tried dropping a Fortizar, we overkilled it slightly.
---
Haven't seen LORDE or Blades form outside of their chinese masters hence the assumption, apologies. Very nice of FRT to let this tier in their coalition though, have to start somewhere I guess..  
---
"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE MER. THE MER IS ON MY SIDE. WE MINE. I WON A WAR. I WIN THE BEST WARS"
---
I have no idea.  Supposedly he has been banned for botting before as can be found in this comment chain, but I havent heard exactly what he's doing to break TOS
---
You still get a weapons timer for DD cycle time + 1 minute (so 5-6 minutes) whether or not the DD hits anything.
---
Honestly I blame the guy who runs around in a totaly shitfit untanked titan more for this.
---
What's WPN support?
---
They dont want to ban as this guy is protected, so they dont want to dig into it.
---
How not to drop a fort 101.
---
What actions do you think he has to defend, exactly
---
It's so much easier to kill structures this way.
---
test campaign please ignore
---
Goons should be the sofa
---
Well you care enough to lie about it pretty consistently
---
Yes please. I'd pay plex for it $$$$$&lt;--see that ccp?
---
try the beta launcher
---
Never heard about tbh.        
---
For me it was UO -&gt; WOW^(like wtf is this shit) -&gt; EVE
---
Use your noodle.
---
Missile and gunnery support skills
---
I got two logged in and one that "cant validate account"
---
Well it definitely looks like a deserved loss for a retard Titan pilot in a retard alliance. Only natural selection at work.
---
Nope
---
I have an idea. He is using it to control many clients as one.
---
He should be banned this time because he used input broadcasting/automation. This is illegal.
---
Would have lived if hull tanked.
---
Easy dunks he said. 
---
Technically they just abuse the cyno imbalance. Its really on CCP to fix this.
---
I love this sheet, but it it possible to make it somehov pull prices and being able to see total cost of jobs and stuff? Eventually in a paid for version?
---
Also no rocket league??
---
Yep, this worked. Cheers mate.
---
Yeah. Though if you throw a few chat messages out there at specific times of the day they might come to the false conclusion that you're active in one Timezone but not another. So they then go out in the tz they think you're inactive and boom. 
---
"We blapped the cunt" - Steadyo (probably)
---
PGL Tapi's out.
---
and for once the supers got off a nice kill steal, for all the times Titans ninja DD the target denying supers the kill lol
---
if you think that dork did anything ban worthy, take it to ccp/an isd/whoever has the authority to investigate and do something about it and wait for their decision. stop making bad and useless posts.
---
you're not allowed to find it interesting, ok, be cool and don't care like we do - so lame
---
Have a look at the other reply, worked for me.
---
It also helps that the second "special" item (Intact Shield Emitter) is a lot more expensive than the second Sansha item (Nanite Compound).
---
We had a short lived issue with the login system right after downtime, it's now recovered :) 
---
GODDDAMNIT ~~LENNY~~ HYPERION 
---
I'm Poppy
---
Worked for me to, cheers
---
I'm confused how that is relevant to what I just said? You're literally saying you installed Skill Urself for protection, how could you possibly spin that any other way? 
---
I logged in on my laptop and then when i returned to my desktop and tried to log in again it just worked. Odd
---
Well is there any evidence for this?  All I've gathered so far is he camps a region's systems with a bunch of cloaky alts to gather intel.  Now if he was, lets say, broadcasting keys to a bunch of clients to bomb people in bombers, or to retrieve a lot of mining drones at once, or to gank people in highsec, that would be illegal.
---
If he's just using key broadcasting to log in or change settings on all the clients at once that's considered fine by the TOS, i believe
---
They were kinda worthless, if i remember right and i dont bother to try find them in Kobam where i have them most likely. They were a broken mechanism in many way, did 250 dmg and created huge lag spikes, they could flag you as criminal if you dropped some and then 8 hours later when you were in empire someone landed on one of your old mines, and you were criminal flagged and concorded. They were fun and anoying, thats mostly it, you could slow down incomming fleet, but with todays mechanism they would have ZERO purpose in the game cause of jump bridgeses and jump capable ships.
---
could you not have fitted a SINGLE capital shield extender? or some invuls? 
---
PGL Campaign Update #762 coming soon.
---
I never actually fired the Boson at the Tempest. It Safe logged before I got to it.
---
Actually, it was Serenity that said that.
---
Titan without running hards is pretty easy target for a keepstar DD.    
---
This titan had 0 tank 
---
Jesus christ. Will this campaign ever start?
---
Give it 5 years. After every single delve and fountain system has a keepstar someone will randomly drop one of these in 1dq. It will of course have an undock facing the wrong fucking way like most delve structures
---
next weekend
---
Yes, he used it for chatting, but that's just what he was caught for. CCP extremely likely has more evidence if they check their logs, but they dont wanna do that.
---
Actually having any shield tank modules could help .... probably T1 capital shield extender could save him ....
---
Yikes. It's not that hard to drop a structure.
---
Daddy noraus needs to give me isk then
---
give me 80-100 ppl he said
---
DC is also overrated .....
---
Horde is so cute when they try to shitpost.
---
And make it worse at its intended use case? 
---
Cheers mate, appreciate the work!
---
Australian i assume!! 
---
Too bad hes banned, oh wait..
---
Think about this.         
---
Instead of paying for the super you can now "exit" the alliance and cleaning all the corp/alliance hangars you have access and transferring all alliance citadels to alt corp before you sell them to someone. 
---
Somewhere between next weekend and next year.
---
&gt;TEST flair
---
It is useless in a sense, that there is now way for players to say for sure.
---
It's maybe not useless if it helps getting CCPs attention to check it out.
---
It is useless because we won't get an answer. CCP doesn't comment on that sorta thing afaik, so unless he gets banned we will never know if he was just innocent or CCP didn't bother. 
---
But since there are those exceptions it's only natural to take longer than an employee needed to ban him after seeing the chatlogs.
---
I'm not in HK.  I just think you're a shit CSM.  And the downvotes prove my point.  Again, you're the Eve Trump.  You keep your base happy, and we'll see how the next election goes.  Try representing the whole game and I'll be your downvotes go away.  Keep being a smug goon and the downvotes will continue.  
---
So manic: https://zkillboard.com/kill/74589119/
---
god damn this is sad
---
I’ll let you know TAPI is the most battlehardened alliance in this game. So if you don’t have a test flair I don’t even know what you’re doing on this Reddit 
---
Do you fucking not understand that CCP cant touch this if the is to remain in game? The more they dig, the more shit they find (not that they actually need it to justify the ban).
---
kill of the year :-)
---
It seems to be legit to use broadcasting in the client to set them up.
---
There is a possibility, and i don't say it's very likely, that he didn't use it to broadcast commands.      
---
I don't know. You don't know either. So let CCP handle it. If he is banned at some point you can pat your had and claim all the credit for all i care.
---

What fit do you use on that Dramiel? I'd like to join the cause :-)
---
Thanks for proving me right
---
He would lose more than that in the long run, just from the moons he mines.  Also, much to the the annoyance of many, I am the only one able to transfer alliance citadels, and I am also the only one with full access to the alliance wallet. 
---
What are you even talking about at this point. Who is this guy 'protected' by? Why do CCP give a fuck about some nobody cloaky camper? How much tinfoil is on your helmet?
---
^^ this, fix local first. 
---
Well, he had 80-100 people, and it was an easy dunk, sooooo...
---
Still better than TEST shitposts tbh.
---
Yeah, this is all intended for corp play, long-term risk valuation and pockets of space that are well-defended. The amount of ores some of these corps need for military upkeep can be quite absurd, so they squeeze out all the mining power they can get not just for profit, but to keep up the larger scale operations which is where they rake in the real money from.Do not fly a Rorqual by yourself, don’t even fly an Exhumer. Just do a Covetor and you’ll be best off.
---
Solo play can be fun, in my opinion, but it’s not even the same game as the grand strategy faction building in corporations and alliances. There are options in the game that won’t even make sense in the lens of a solo player.
---
Absolutely. But it's in CCPs judgement to let it slide *if* it was just a mistake. 
---
Which i personally don't think it was, but we have neither the means to find out, nor to do anything about it.
---
Gotta RMT* fast 
---
Haha yeah. I was zippin' around just boppin' people. I'm surprised they even paid attention to me.
---
tbf he only said it'd be an easy dunk
---
didn't specify who'd get dunked :smart:
---
Wait goons always criticize horde for not giving srp to all fleets.Now it turns out Tapi doesen't give srp to all fleets either?
---
You guys are cute when you try to do a campaign
---
Just the tip
---
You're a goon.  You're supposed to be smugposting and trying to make this eviction narrative last another 6 months.  Be careful - I hear Brisc is roaming around this thread...  
---
The input broadcaster is protected by CCP as that is the only true reason he is not banned. Same with the supers that were reported for months by a ton of players. The evidence is clear. Its time to ban.
---
&gt;Why do CCP give a fuck about some nobody cloaky camper?
---
Because he is apparently not a "nobody" to CCP.
---
Sorry to bother you guys with a random ping, but can whoever is "iristacheia" on Reddit, please send me a PM. Thanks.
---
I mean I don't have any real issue with rorqs in their current state other than the ridiculous ore output turning eve into titans online
---
just some suggestions to combat botting by making bottable content less lucrative in favour of more activity intensive content
---
Sc only actually committed caps once a few of ours entered grid, though im not really talking about that fight specifically, just in general minmatar tend to suck sc’s dick when fighting us.
---
closed the game and watched youtube
---
Ratting fleets are primarily for Newbeans that dont have the knowledge/SP to rat alone yet.
---
Strange thing to happen in such an Alliance tbh
---
So close to kill, and why waste your fire on my apostle (T_T) hayek is a good boy
---
Bastion is this a thing?
---
aren't they like third grade CFC renters?
---
if loot fairy hadn't said no he still would have dropped it
---
just... differently
---
I have known one occasion SC was actually temp blue. SC just have a hateboner for you I think.
---
code
---
I did the math on it when they came out. I'm sure PI usage has increased since, but the amount required to build one was the entire jita trade volume for the last 20 months.
---
Hahahaha
---
There are no \~gudfites\~ in EVE unless both parties are up for that kind of thing mate.
---
Goal of standing fleets is not to amuse roamers, but to shit on the roamers as hard as possible in order to make them select different region to have fun in next time.
---
A downvote isn't really salt.  But the WH response: "Meh" triggered a flurry of Init posts about how amazing this victory was.  That's reverse salt.  I think.  Whatever it is, you guys took a victory and made it sad, and my brain hurt.  Congratulations.  
---
That's a lot of flexing for a critter with such tiny arms :)
---
I see dinos get dunked, I upvote
---
Also really nice video editing/music
---
same
---
make him play in eutz and I'll record it
---
That's mats from the blueprint?
---
wouldn't you save a bunch of mats if properly researched and in a rigged sotiyo?
---
Or are is that somehow different for upwell structures?
---
As you can probably tell, I'm no indu guy...
---
Stop dunking briscs authority with your off the wall posting
---
Well I guess they are more thing then CO2 at this time :))
---
doesn't help they (CCP) made it easier to bot with the introduction of skill injectors and alpha clone state because  $$$.
---
I can tell you this much.... we where not waiting on your 3 silly dreads to jump in.
---
yes because that form of PVE is even more mind numbing then ratting. With ratting i at leas get paid
---
Ive been seeing that opinion said since the rorq changed. Hardly unpopular. In fact, I'd say its the most prevelant opinion on rorquals.
---
We managed to still be there. And our leader aint banned. vOv
---
Wait, so are you saying you DD'd your own titan?  
---
That's priceless.
---
oof
---
Yikes, you are grumpy.
---
Don't think you should be proud of GOTGs situation atm, you are as irrelevant as SMA 2.0

If you re on the ball, sure. Depending on the exact ratspawn and how thrilling the stuff is you watch at that given time it might go south though. Or if that frikkin delivery-service-guy cant find his pencil again. No shit, this almost did cost me a full-tank skiff once.
---
You're wrong
---
Contact me ingame and I'll help you. 
---
I'd forgot about this, thanks for the laugh.
---
it was around 150 Rorqus in 4-5 groups (biggest was 59) guzzling Querious moons, a lot of very young toons (injected), on every Moon they left at least one or two afk guys missing the jump ...
---
Yeah a director of STK flipped and took some citadel. This man was thethered for a small afk (8 min) and when he came back his super was in wreck. Very bad luck.
---
I would think it's more a case of CCP having the wrong priorities (new flashy content all the time instead of fixing the stuff we already have that's horribly broken), than the CSM not trying to make positive change.
---
&gt;The game mechanics we all seem to agree are broken aren't getting addressed - at least not in a timely manner. Actual game-breaking bugs go untouched for months or years. Why do we even have them? Does anyone think they've made a positive change? CCP fucks this game up all the time - I'm not at all convinced the CSM makes any difference... 
---
I'm fairly sure that you have no idea how CSM even works.
---
I would agree with you. But those citadel rigs man... nobody is going to rip those out willingly.  
---
I've said it before - citadels are both a blessing and an anchor preventing anyone from moving anywhere. If structure rigs could be removed, perhaps things would become less stale.  
---
Naturally there should be rules - for example no rig removal in the first week of a wardec (with a week cooldown to prevent chain wardec abuse), no rig removal when structure is vulnerable or reinforced...  
---
Game mechanics reward developing your space. Doing that makes players unable to leave without shooting oneself in the foot. So the game becomes stale.
---
Whatever you do, when a refresh token error appears when hitting play, do NOT remove the account and relogin. You'll have issues getting that account logged in. The refresh token error resolves itself after a period of time.
---
It's very timezone dependent, and CNTZ still represents about 2/3 to 3/4 of WinterCo and determines most of the foreign policy, so of course they'd be "calling the shots". Home defense is mostly left up to whichever FC is active at the time. LORDE and Blades (and Random Violence and Cyno.Up) are basically asleep at CNTZ, but conversely the Chinese are asleep/at work during EUTZ &amp; USTZ.
---
In any case, I don't find it that different from other coalitions. There's basically one large entity with a large supercap fleet (Goons, Test, NCPL) with a bunch of allied entities with their own cap and subcap assets (Init, Brave, Horde). If you take the alltime, recent, and weekly zkillboards on all of those alliances and then compare them to FRT, LORDE, and Blades, it's more or less the same levels of PvP and/or feeding.
---
that is a valid point of view. I would have no problem with the Rorqs capabilities if they had the same mechanic for excavators as for fighters --&gt; multibox abilitity/input broadcasting ability limited 
---
You're wrong.
---
How to attack - when you're close to an enemy (NPC or player) you should see the ship icon (with it's name, distance ship type and other info) on your overview so either right-click on it and select Lock Target or just use the faster way - CTRL+left click on the enemy ship. When you have target lock on it click on the weapon icon.
---
How to find a citadel - simplest answer, when you're out in space just right-click anywhere, you'll see a drop down menu, there will be a section called Structures and there you will have a list of citadel's in the system. Mind you, not every system has a citadel in it and even if it has become it's player owned they can not let you in or kick you out whenever they want.
---
How to fly my ship - that's a very broad question, and you really should have learned that through tutorial. Anyways, a quick answer would be, undock from the station/citadel and just double click in space in any direction - this will make your ship fly into the direction you indicated. And that's kinda it.

Basically right click everything. That the easiest answer to all of your questions.

holy shit i was wondering why he stopped posting his shit everywhere
---
Hello i've got a noobish question about missions. I finally grinded enough rep to do level 4 missions.. however i looked around abit and lots of different sites recommend ships like a rattle, or a marauder.
---
Now i wonder is there a ship i can use using t2 heavy railguns because i lack the skills for sentry drones and cruise missiles so a rattle is not really an option. 
---
I get the idea that i should probably wait for some skills but yeah... 
---
The sniping from a 100km has worked so far in a brutix. 
---
"Lets undermine what the CSM has done because I have no idea how it works at all, no?"
---
Test is so cute if they shitpost about dunking us and then getting dunked themselves
---
See above.
---
respectable citizens of lowsec
---
Must give more upvotes for DS9 reference 
---
Why are you mentioning a bunch of goon ops as INITs feats? 
---
TAPI is so cute when they try to pvp without goons holding their hand
---
I live in Syndicate (Serpentis region), and definitely gets more than 10m average. Think 30m on average for a relic site is about right  
---
Looking forward to that. Please also link in coalition mumble soon.
---
&gt; Now we are reduced to using VNIs and Procurers to make ISK
---
Nothing new then? Goons, with their staggered SIG deployments, have developed a strategy guaranteed to make any nullsec alliance bend the knee in a war of pure attrition (as happened up north). And they decide to use it against the one entity that it's unlikely to work against - Pandemic Horde. Why?
---
I would rather have leaks to large alliance but changes being discussed than CCP not having any organized input.
---
Big design changes not being addressed or bug not being fixed generally means tho aren't single way things, it's either hard to implement/fix or clearly isn't a priority for CCP. Check the minute, you will see the CSM mentionning low sec every single time, generally asking for a specific meeting about it etv.
---
This isn't on the CSM fault, this is on CCP fault (and sometimes, the players for not understanding an issue).
---
How did you get the Freighters in ?
---
You can't put wormhole dread pilots in a green site on not expect them to shoot the NPCs. They just can't help themselves. 
---
You shouldn't be proud for doing something (in this case - posting) badly. 
---
Yonis for Snuffed Leadership!
---
Ouch
---
buuuuuuuut it's good PR
---
well these ships don't fly very well before they're built
---
Test invasion please ignore 
---
Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence.
---
&gt; NC. Flair
---
That titan would've survived if it was docked.
---
well, that was nice showcase of Keep DD
---
He is the puppet master already. 
---
Dude that's not cool 
---
At least they dont get camped while logged off in supers for a week.
---
Yes
---
Chill on the feeding and you'd have a stockpile mate.. No need to mine when your alliance is made up of noodle eating RMT'ers anyway is there.
---
I think the operative word here is "was". 
---
That's certainly true. Skill Injectors and Alphas removed some of the consequences for botting and I am sure they regreted that decision to some degree. However, sometimes you have to make some calls and go through with the decision, even if it causes problems in other areas. Not chaning something because you are affraid rulebreakers will exploit it isn't necessarily what you want to do for a game. 
---
Because if you really go down that line to the end, you would have to remove all PvE because having PvE in the game is what allows bots to do damage. 
---
It's not a Black/White issue really and while I for one agree that Injectors/Alpha's were a bad thing to do, I don't see that as a grounds for "CCP doesn't care about botting / promotes botting". 
---
gf
---
Pretty much. There's so much unfinished stuff even from the early days that was just left in the dust that CCP never went back and finished or fixed, and never will. I honestly don't hold much hope any of this will ever get fixed, and its just got progressively worse. I think they've shown the only thing they really can do IS skins/lootbox type things, but actual real deep down code, getting down deep in their own game and fixing one thing without breaking ten others and then just leaving it that way for 6 months or a year or more, just isn't happening. Not sure if its poor devs, or poor management, or both - but their track record isn't very good and I don't hold too much hope for the future tbh with the way things have been going.
---
Wow
---
Nothing to see here valkorsia has more than 420 raitarus to drop when this campaign starts next weekend 
---
or the ones complaining about the mineral price slope literally here on this sub ... while they themselves are the solitary reason for that ...
---
&gt; SRP: Yes
---
Works for sort dragon
---
tinyurl is banned
---
Oh man powers what a sick burn you sure showed him!!!!1
---
Holy shit, I'm so smug right now. I'm almost annoyed at myself for the level of smugness this has propelled me to. It's absolutely insufferable.
---
I really appreciate the advise on how to not fit a Ragnarok. Thank you OP.
---
&gt; Every CSM has leaked economic data in violation of the NDA
---
hah. And where is your proof?
---
The 'true reason' he is not banned is CCP is garbage at investigating this stuff. Like I mentioned earlier it took ~3 Mo ths for Gaara to be banned after PL captured a video of him input broadcasting. 
---
So if Horde states that the stratop fleet is SRPed, which they always are, then that's proof that Horde doesn't usually get SRP on their fleets. If TEST does the same thing, why don't people say the same thing about them?
---
Omega here. What ship should I use to haul things like Frigs and it's fitting bought in Jita to my system (around 30jumps)?
---
If you want to go boson ratting, literally fit it for armor
---
Especially keepstars in Syndicate. :oops
---
Lol @ gfs with ncdot and pl carrying you
---
40faction forts so they wouldn’t be homeless 
---
Serves you right for chasing a tempest with a Titan tbh 
---
Idk what you call vanguard 
---
Hey, it is simple, just inject a lot of Rorqual toons --&gt; mine the shit out of your region and build caps/supers/titans like there is no tomorrow. Make your region literally Hisec with an umbrella. Then in that safety mine even more and build Dread Caches in NPC Null Regions. When having 100 there welp them to kill the afk-Rorq and get dumpstered by the opponents super umbrella ... sounds like fun and engaging gameplay ...
---
They will tho
---
Pgl fleets are always srp. He just doesn't click the right box when he's writing up the ping.
---
You can still come to Catch for un-arranged fights and if we can we'll give you and us a fun 'as-equal-as-possible' fight. Ask around, many people come to Catch and have great fun.
---
Impass is a different story. Please don't come there for a fun fight. You won't get one.
---
Test pings say no stop lot because FCs don't send the ping out correctly. Anything but a fun roam gets srp in test though.
---
is this where we get to point out the irony
---
Its like saying init = goons.
---
&gt; 40faction forts so they wouldn’t be homeless. 
---
Weird narrative choice but ok. 40 faction first so they aren’t “homeless” despite the fact that their home was literally never under actual threat.
---
&gt; The bl/horde failed to evict.
---
To be clear we were never actually going after deklein. Idk where people got that from. We were going for branch where the rental space is and we got “beat” by goons forming to defend them repeatedly and also harassing us at home because apparently 40 faction forts also bought Sort more than “not being homeless”
---
You only get SRP on strat ops. We also get SRP on most other things except some kitchen sink roams. Do you guys get SRP on your gatecamp ops? no you dont. Do you get SRP for small scale home defense (before it turn into an all hand on deck strat op)? no you dont. 
---
Besides, lore is there to explain game mechanics not the other way around. 
---
Good fight test/evictus/RR bros.
---
Thanks for dropping with cojones, 
---
Always a pleasure.
---
lol fraternity...
---
No, what are you thinking of?
---
Bit late to this one, But from what I've heard it was the internal CCP roadmap for the next little while (I didn't see it so don't know the timeframe it was on)
---
Horde: 
---
&gt;**@everyone** after hyping his coalition just to stand everyone down over a football game, pgl prepinged for an autz op starting after DT be around  and join Steadyo's fleet if you can, good chance of tapi trying to make up for the lack of results they have had all weekend 
---
pgl:
---
&gt; They're ping mentioned they're going to form for us and beat us.
---
Wut
---
just wait
---
I think I noticed that now
---
When is your campaign starting? 
---
&gt;CCP is garbage at investigating this stuff
---
How convenient that this is completely inseparable from "protecting". Ive been reporting certain bots for at least 6 months, but they are still around. Its clear beyond any fucking "reasonable doubt" they are bots, yet no action from CCP.
---
The only explanation left is that they dont wanna ban certain "players". "t20" is just what they were caught for.
---
i agree that the csm is not really terribly useful anymore.
---
well they nerfed fax so init could evict hard knocks
---
Yes, if CCP wants a focus group they can just choose them at random from all the playstyles in the game, not this wannabe space important bs
---
Goons complaining about input broadcasting when there alliance is filled with input automating. 
---
Why wasn't it tanked if it was hunting something?
---
&gt; You can still come to Catch for un-arranged fights
---
This is the definition of "arranged fights" literally if the attacker cannot choose region and target by himself
---
At least that's one Titan less to drop on a small gang. Hoist by thine own petard.
---
Legacy pets proving how incompetant they are.
---
I really want to reply to all of the incorrect assumptions, speculation and outright horse shit that is posted here about the make up and structuring in WinterCo and Fraternity. However, reading the nonsense is far more entertaining. May I just say that WinterCo is a VERY diverse and dynamic group of people. We have entities from all parts of the world and  of many languages. We run fleets in two to five (she said FIVE) languages on any given day. If you and/or your Corp are looking for a home of friends and fun like you saw in the video, feel free to PM. resume the shit posting nerds, it would not be EVE without it. &lt;3
---
They lost some ISK wars so far.
---
I still don't get goons and bastion though. 
---
&gt; Literally everywhere.
---
Go to Geminate then - getting caps dropped on you is a incredibly rare experience there, generally reserved for strategic objectives and/or other caps.
---
Same for Catch btw.
---
Come back you goat. Your ability to surgically extract salt made my day every day.
---
Your, re wong
---
Lol irony
---
I love how there are no horde on that kill. Probably should just move to branch...oh wait...
---
&gt; CCP will go for what they perceive to be the money maker rather than actually improving the game.
---
It makes my brain hurt when thinking about this.  People somehow are willing to pay more for a worse game.  If the player base actually got their shit together and stop paying for shit and actually put up money for good improvements,  we'd probably get less shit and more improvements.  
---
Over at world of warcraft we have to create an earth shattering amount of noise to be heard by blizzard at all. 
---
Over at EVE you have a mainline to get in contact with devs where they have to be heard, not heeded but heard. And you think its a **bad thing**.
---
Two words: Brisc Rubal. 
---
You might want to look again, chief.
---
Lol, did I say you need to come to Catch? No, just that in that case we can both have fun and have a 'good' fight. If you come to Impass, you'll probably not have fun (but we will).
---
I never said you should do this or that, just offered a solution to the 'REEEEE they'll only blob'.
---
You guys keep saying you want content and fun fights, I/we offer an opportunity to have that by coming to Catch and both of us having fun.

---
God bless we don’t have a TAPI csm this year.
---
PGL lied in a ping for numbers?! :o
---
Why would you tank a slippery rag?
---
It's just Steadyo he said
---
Who dares memes.
---
I need to get back to doing that in lo-sec. Used to have a mining fleet and a rat/PvP on discord chat 
---
Siege gives ewar immunity, has no cooldown and is shorter than panic - literally the only way to prevent panic is catching someone as they finish the last rock in the anom/moon.
---
Nothing. Everything got mined out, ratting still happened, and horde super isk posi.
---
it is when you give a character a chinese name
---
I'm not sure that deleting the csm is the right move, but banning certain people from running and encouraging people who are there for the health of the game instead of sucking alliance dick would be the right move. I look at the csm right now, and there's a number of people who just add nothing, Brisc and the judge are the primary examples. They accomplish nothing but adding to an echo chamber and being a pain in the ass.
---
And to add onto that they, especially brisc show a total disregard for the health of the game overall, making their bias very clear, they're in it for what makes goons stronger, not what is good for eve. 
---
Plus they're total cunts on reddit. 
---
(Que angry brisc message in 5...4...)
---
Funny thing is, the Imperium has never had a candidate removed. This clearly proves that we alone have the integrity to provide helpful feedback, free of ulterior motives. Therefore, to ensure the purity and functionality of the CSM going forward, only vote for Imperium candidates. Thank you.
---
If we're talking HS to HS, any T1 hauler will do. You can fit dozen of frigates with fitting. That being said, if it's T1 frigates, it should be fine, but if you're hauling faction or pirate frigates, it could make your hauler worth suicide ganking so take care to split cargo value. If you only need a few frigates per trip, a more agile hauler could do the trick. Check Eve Uni wiki page about hauling if you are not sure which is which, but except for Gallente all faction propose a agile one and a largest cargo space hauling ship.
---
If you are lazy and don't want to do 30 jumps, you can always buy from a closer trade hub, or do courrier contracts.
---
People still struggling with their hangovers after the weekend.
---
What part of "next weekend" don't you understand?!
---
&gt;paldave
---
yay, lets create limited thunderdomes, or even instanced PvP, this will suit your playstyle even more, but then have fun on a server with afk-Farmers that throw some meaningless assets into some prearraged fights that pgls koolaid turns into some "important shit".
---
All people that do real pvp will have left then, and many already did as I can see. I mean it looks totally healthy when the average logged in Accounts decline by 40% over the last 5 years while in the same time people with 2-3 accounts pewing left and people afk-mining with 10-xx Accounts joined. This game is dying out because its literally FarmVille now ...
---
lol that reddit CTA though big F for your karma 
---
Yes please damn it
---
Of the 19 supers on that killmail, 6 were from horde.
---
Next goalpost pls.
---
You might want to learn to read before you post
---
Man, have you guys already forgotten the severe burnout you got at the end of the week from that? I still remember how flinchy you guys were any time a fleet of more than 10 dudes got near UALX.
---
barely
---
/r/madlad
---
wormholes are hard :(
---
im kicking every hawks member who has posted in this thread
---
Are you arguing in favor or against with that argument, because he's hilariously good entertainment.
---
"is shooting a player more engaging then shooting a drone?"
---
yeah CSM is purely for goons to lobby CCP into not nerfing rorqual mining
---
you don't know how to use zkill very well do you?
---
I‘m forced by drone maniacs please help
---
Das racis
---
for me it's not hilarious, it's devastating..
---
At least they dudnt get PTSD that presented them from properly using supers for the next half a year
---
&gt; Every CSM in my memory had at least one member kicked for leaking or some other shady shit.
---
Clearly you have a pretty selective memory.
---
Seems to be working. Maybe you should vote, next time? Nah, better to not vote at all. That's easier, right?
---
lol of course they do. Only roams and not official fc fleets are not srpd
---
Good thing all those alliances on the killmail are famous for not needing eachother to simply exist
---
Not elite ?????
---
spodbrain
---
Halt citizen. Do not be alarmed- your location is being tracked and re-education officers are em route. Compliance is mandatory,
---
It wasn’t even a WANGS fleet lol. We were just along for the ride. 
---
So you made a reddit post because of a dread kill?
---
yes yes the average masses piling together to outvote a coalition that mandates what its members must vote for is the solution, rather than say limit CSM representatives to 1-2 from each area of the game....
---
Well, I like new Aura. Bite me!
---
90% of what dropped did not even have time to whore, not sure on horde numbers but they sure as hell are more useful than your ball and chain.
---
Least you can evac Requiem easier.
---
So it was your titan and you killed it with the keepstar? That's even better, hah.
---
To not get killed by accident for example.
---
Why wouldn't you fit all slots on a titan? 
---
Uh, the CSM is elected via STV. You don't have to outvote the Imperium, you just have to get 9.1% of the vote.
---
* why do you think it is skill to kill a titan with 350 people from HK?
---
It was 50, there isnt that much skill involved. I hear the titan pilot was a brainlet.
---
* was M95 born in '95?
---
He wasnt born, he came riding thru a wormhole on the back of a turtle. That happened in 95.
---
* at what year (B.C.) was this system seeded with linked capitals?
---
6969
---
* could you explain me the concept of ragerolling?
---
You get really mad, the kinda mad you get when your mum tells you to go to bed but you wanna stay up and watch Starship Troopers just for the titties. You then just blast thru the hole in your most expensive ship. 
---
Would that have mattered? It's not like they had the balls to undock either way.
---
CCP does need a player body to give them feedback on matters which they can't immerse themselves in. The game would be worse without the CSM.
---
You and everybody else's problem with CSM is the kind of players getting elected. Elections are not a good way to select this body of players. It makes it a populism and publicity stunt. It causes self interested empire builders to keep getting elected due to (duh) empires having a selective advantage on voting organization (a fact that'll never change btw). And it does not create the same publicity anymore for CCP.
---
CSM should probably be handpicked from people of a diverse background, and CCP should ignore the screeching (if that's what they are afraid of) of players on why they picked a particular guy over others. Even that would be a better system. They can even keep doing the elections to select a couple empire builder CSMs, and handpick others, so alliances can keep at their election dickswinging.
---
The meme isn't overused but it's not that of an original format. You've put TEST when you could have put a solid 2/3 of NS alliances honestly. I give it a 3/10, which awards you with no downvote because that's around the average of this subreddit posts.
---
\#GianBal
---
Oh i would agree. It's just that the drone offers roughly the same amount of resistance...
---
It wasn't a completely serious remark, you know.
---
lol they only did it because of the profits. they knew pretty well beforehand and still went ahead and implemented it, simply because of money. the game has entered it's maintenance mode back then and SP trading opened up the milking of the power autistic player base. 
---
Hi welcome to chilis downvotes to the left
---
which is still difficult when its spread amongst however many other csm candidates there are since you wont get anywhere near the organisation that null corps will get without actually being in a coalition. having more than 1-2 goon representatives in CSM serves literally 0 purpose, since they are told what to think by goon leadership anyway.
---
Cyno.Up, We made it big boys.
---
This is just the warm up. The official campaign will begin once the sovereign nation of TAPI is joined by CFC forces. The supremely independent group Snuff may also be there.
---
That was one heck of a fight! Good times - just bringing our dose of content to your door. This was   
---
 initiated by Evictus, with help from Test's Star Frontiers corp, and Req's Hyperion mostly (on the Legacy side). Definitely did not plan to bait out 22 titans, we just wanted 1 or 2 :(
---
Lot's of fun, comms were nuts, and we got bested. See you on the next grid /u/ThinningIce 
---
In favour of the idea of the CSM, in practice I think its a joke though. Because of Brisc-like people. 
---
Doesn't count because you were the CFC at the time, right? 
---
Expert catch
---
Sure are smug about a bunch of kills you guys didn't get lol
---
OP, You're a little late, this has been already discussed when the chances took place, long story short the voice actor is not available anymore and will never happen not even for absurd amounts of IRL isk.
---
He says after NC/PL/Horde risked it all on Keepstar hull timers and Legacys super fleet has been told to stay in Eso to protect the miners.
---
They reinforced our staging while our supers were camped and then lost the timer. Where were you going with that exactly? 
---
Is in Space Violence, calls other people pets???? Sarcastic irony or inbred retardation? 
---
I called my vote brigade of me and my 37 imaginary friends ....
---
?
---
Yep deffo a try hard windows hater. 
---
200% sure of that. Hate windows and everything it stands for.
---
I love that you feel CCP has some sort of bias, when it's been proven time and again through numerous posts on Reddit that EVERY null group is infested with bots and input broadcasters. Who exactly are CCP protecting? It'd have to be the bot makers themselves and I seriously doubt they are in cahoots. 
---
Hm, i don't know if it is possible from the outside to tell who does a good job and who does not.
---
You realize that you can anticipate what the botters will buy and then sell it back to them before killing them again with moderate entropy of loot fair variations. It's actually way more profitable than ratting. But go ahead and return to crying about a problem instead of doing something to solve it. 
---
It was done because CCP wanted to stop "rage tickets" - As in, players who would submit a ticket complaning about a loss or harrassment. The extra steps needed acts as a filter to give players a minute or two to let off steam and consider "Is this worth it?". CCP themselves said this when they implemented Zendesk - Supposedly it worked fairly well based on the Customer Support Fanfest panel of that year.
---
The CSM doesn't put ideas into CCPs workflow, CCP is working on stuff while super disconnected from their own game, some features they are unsure about they ask the CSM about, and then they can identify possible issues cause they play the game.
---
NOOO not change citadel mechanics, because this truly will only hurt the "small guys" ....
---
Lmao zing
---
You've never lived until you've been running across nullsec from a 30 man "fleet", have dropped out of warp into a Python minefield and just gone "oh, fuck."
---
They weren't fun.
---
:smoog:
---
Go to bed Mike
---
I was one of the people in a hictor for a week , 4hrs a day. Didn’t burn me out one bit.
---
Doesn't count because he wasn't removed for leaking NDA info, but for being an asshole in a public manner.
---
That long ass ping by steadyo. Holy fuck post a tldr next time blah blah blah blah blah blah
---
Why is random in quotes?
---
😂 man you guys got dumpstered.
---
Yet Steve Ronuken manages it, consistently, for years, and he's associated with no one. The trick is to actually give a shit.
---
You think of everything that was bad and came from CSM (leaking for example). But what about what was good (being able to provide player feedbacks directly to the right dev, providing advices or helping to find a good solution to fix some issues, etc)
---
I don't need specific examples, there are plenty, but nothing is black or white, but at least, the game is better with the CSM than without imho. 
---
&gt; lol of course they do.
---
The random t1 cruiser/destroyer gangs don't to my understanding (not that poorfit t1 srp matters), though I haven't actually looked into it that hard.
---
&gt;Once again, this is prestaged and not how "non-consensual" PvP works ...
---
Hahahahaha, so how does that statement compute with people getting wrecked by others in bigger ships?
---
You come to me to do some 'non-consensual' PvP and I'm not allowed to bring 'non-consensual' escalation? 
---
Sure thing haus
---
vote for you as the most caring poster of this sub, taking care of all our health by taking the brain bug out ....
---
I’m not really a fan of the CSM either. It’s essentially dictated by the same N+1 that’s currently draining out non-blobby nullsec content. 
---
In addition I don’t think there’s any regular checks in place internally to ensure impartiality, and that’s especially important when the mega-block in the game has the majority of CSM seats. 
---
PANIC module needs to get fukt btw. 
---
To be fair SRP on strat ops are all you need in my opinion. You help the allaince you're in, if you lose your ship you get it back. There's plenty of things to do for ISK in your alliance's space, which you can use for whatever you'd like, such as getting a few solo PvP ships.
---
&gt; small scale home defense (before it turn into an all hand on deck strat op)
---
Yikes I can't remember the last time we had a gold pen.
---
its time to stop
---
&gt;PL
---
&gt;Risked it all
---
wut.
---
They cynod in on the far side and fucked off.

&gt;Only roams and not official fc fleets are not srpd

next weekend^tm
---
Because he still can't wrap his head around the fact that Delve contains tons of targets compared to other regions of the game, which makes Delve a good target for entities such as BB.
---
Chat shit get hit Michael. Init freighters are en route to hawks home, in 1 year you will be evicted. Enjoy it while it lasts. 
---
yes.
---
Beard is on route just put the first beard clip on it.
---
We tried so hard and got so far, but in the end it didn't even matter :pepeshrek:
---
"beating 40k Goons and legacy coalition is super easy if anyone would try. We are only half the game"
---
Its a difference between a shitpost I laugh my ass off about and a badpost I hide my face inside my palm on reading ...
---
or the 2x a-type invul in his cargo
---
tldr; Tapi rekt, can't even anchor structures, tried to sell op as easy dunk, turned out to be a easy dunk for the wrong side.
---
come back to bed and cuddle me
---
been posted about a week ago
---
CCP did focus groups for a while (t3d focus group for example), i think they are much better approach than CSM.
---
Got a link to that? I completely missed it. 
---
Sue Abbott -  "HAHA made you form to kill a structure!"
---
Still you do nothing else than krabbing your ass of and bribing people to not dumpster you during that, while CO2 has created a lot of content across all the map over close to 2 years ...
---
wow... LZHWKZ CEO being salty towards Pando ... that's new
---
&gt; This is what's amusing - you guys literally can't just say "GF" without having to qualify it
---
it wasn't a good fight you slack jawed aspie, it was a straight up eviction, of course nerds won't say good fight when there is no fight to be had. 
---
What **is** amusing is how salty you nerds are getting because the other side isn't calling a straight up blob a good fight, and yours and pando's pathetic attempts at damage control. 
---
If anything the HK guys have been far more respectful and reasonable than you all, and they were the ones being evicted.
---
misspelt misspelt
---
Show me on the doll where the elite wormholers touched you.
---
Sounds like you deserved it
---
Yeah, imagine needing all of panfams 25k dudes to take on Legacys 35k dudes, Its understandable that they need to team up with the 50k goons to handle that blob

Hey man, in every case, every year, there is some major metagame or drama happening surrounding CSM. You think players trust these people? Yeah sure, some of them are well meaning, but its blatantly clear they're only there for "their guys" and not the greater community. 
---
If this post and comments are any indicator, I think that CCP should just focus more on experts in fields (yes there will likely be bleed through here). 
---
We are at a point on the internet and communications ingame and out of game, that CCP doesnt really need CSM due to how easy communication between dev and player actually is. Open an official discord, stuff like that. You'll just need the filter you already use for CSM and be selective with quality feedback, you just need to scale it up. 
---
Also, if CCP truly cared about CSM, then voting would take place within the client and CCP would actually make it seem like a big deal through the launcher or client, rather than the current method that just rewards the groups that can organize people logging onto forums and following a voting priority list the best. 
---
This need to be "ON" to work.      
---
Now this is shitposting. Who could have imagined that one of our valued allies booting wormholers out of their hole would have this generated this much drama?
---
I mean, you could try using a rails-fitted Rokh with a shield tank, but it's really not ideal. People are suggesting these things because they work well, railgun sniping is not really a very efficient way to run L4 missions - you can make it work, but it will take longer than it has to
---
I would really train drones/missiles/etc. so you can at least use a Dominix/Raven or so while you earn ISK to buy a Rattle or so
---
You could use an armor-tanked Mega with rails too
---
Lame attempt at a PanFam morale post
---
Wait !

Remember you can only have fun with titans if your from Imperium in Delve, didn't you get that memo?
---
I am the guy farming these "pilots" and can confirm they are all bots. 
---
Your was DD intentionally.      
---
Fit was checked ... bud  
---
CCP caters to null and generally likes griefers. That's why it took 15 years of newbros getting slaughtered (at the expense of the health of the game) in HS by war deccers to start to address the issue.
---
CCP protects their "friends". You think what t20 got caught for was all they did? CCP has been interfering both actively and passively in the game since forever. Refusal to ban is "passive support". It explains why even when the evidence is clear, nothing happens.
---
Do we know how we can get these / the Nyx one? Is it just PLEX or is it something else?
---
And somehow TEST has less active pvp characters according to zkill.
---
this nyx ....... THIS NYX ........ **THIS NYX**
---
What dread kill? There is none... Dumbass 
---
&gt;  they're only there for "their guys" and not the greater community.
---
So why Aryth told to CCP when they announce rorqual mining "It's going to be broken you should not release this or I will abuse it"
---
Why are the guys from Init (the guys who won) saltier than the HK guys (the guys who lost)
---
There was potential for an almost funny shitpost here but you squandered it with god awful execution 
---
Check out the CSM minutes, for example this one [https://assets.ctfassets.net/7lhcm73ukv5p/4tSKkWWjRe0yagAAYgOUYC/99b4c9be6477bafab52de5b85b786ff5/CSM\_13\_Winter\_Summit\_Minutes.pdf](https://assets.ctfassets.net/7lhcm73ukv5p/4tSKkWWjRe0yagAAYgOUYC/99b4c9be6477bafab52de5b85b786ff5/CSM_13_Winter_Summit_Minutes.pdf) 
---
On top of that the LARGE majority are all from the same alliance. 
---
There should at least be rules that prevent an all Goon GSM again, how do you spin that in any possible way that doesn't greatly benefit the Goons. After all even CCP are Goon pets now.
---
Should be a limit of 1 CSM seat per major alliance .
---
except all those fleets in legacy space
---
I've already stated i don't want him permabanned.  I just want clear and obvious cheating punished.
---
Took me a while to get used to it, not a issue anymore.
---
Why the down boats, making a claim like this and not providing any evidence is well very poor of you.
---
That's bad.
---
Ok buddy, you're crazy, I got it now. 
---
They didn't listen to the focus group when we had them. I was on the rorqual one and blatantly ignored hise when we said it was going to break the game but they didnt listen.
---
But without the animations. 
---
Yes, test is shit, didn't think you would admit it so fast
---
Inb4 querns 
---
and yet my solution would still let steve get in every year, but would also not allow 4 people from the same fucking group to be in the CSM, along with having what 8? of 10 be from big nullsec blocks? No wonder the rest of the game gets ignored and is subsequently shit when the only people talking to ccp only know 1 thing about the game
---
One of these times, I'm going to join your fleet and actually shoot something. Lol
---
(gentle sigh)
---
What does Brisc-like even mean? 
---
I personally would love to see a CSM repping each part of the game with a focus group attached to them, with some form of CCP interact in those groups. 
---
Got me worried there by a sec!
---
they are joining as a full member
---
Relistening to it I catch that now.
---
Yeah, normally I have one...I thinnk it was out getting coffee when I listened to that
---
I’m buying salt futures. 
---
Hey ovepriced cap skins (not subcap ones obviously) are actually wanted and thats a proper way to make money, and Sotiyos arent new. Super proliferation - I believe in most games with time comes more stuff. Rorq mining? If youre not watching you can in 15 seconds lose 5b or get alphad by 3+ supers (bad fot rorqs).
---
I like the idea that I think they were trying to accommodate, which was to make secondary high slots have more utility.  Back when a lot of minmatar was dual weapon, or at least had a couple launcher slots, it gave them a pretty fun utility. 
---
Frankly, I'm not even upset that it's basically a Goon CSM.  They organize, they vote, they deserve to win.  I don't think it's representative, but they're not doing anything wrong getting their guys on the ballot.  My real issue is that the CSM doesn't seem to help, and in many cases, actively hurts through leaking.  Focus groups work.  If CCP wants input, they should just do that from now on.  The current system is just asking for trouble. 
---
Oï mate !
---
L4 missions are generally farmed for the good ISK they make, and even more for those special Burner missions (try to learn a bit about those, they’re great to break the monotony), which is why A LOT of people are always talking about big expensive pirate battleships or Marauders with a price tag as high as a Carrier. However, if you manage to squeeze in enough tank and DPS, a T1 battleship will do just fine until you can get up to something with more efficiency, like said Marauders or Rattlesnake.
---
Concerning what you are asking for : there is only one ship I can think of combining Hybrid weapons with shield tanking : the Caldari Rokh, which will be a fucking bliss for you. Basically, for each level you train in Caldari Battleship skill, your guns’ optimal range are augmented by 10% and every shield resistance by 4% ! 
---
When combined with a Large Micro Jump Drive, this ship is one of the easiest to set for range tanking and sniping. You still have a drone bay big enough to carry a single flight of medium drones (and enough bandwidth to support them), or two flights of light drones that will support you greatly if a frigate manage to go under your guns. I’d say you’ll want to work toward this baby for your L4 running :)
---
However, keep in mind that Hybrids turrets have locked damage (Kinetic &amp; Thermal). You will always hit a secondary damage because each pirate faction is weak to some degree to Thermal, but you’ll shine against Serpentis and Guristas missions. Here is a fitting for your not too expensive :
---
[Rokh, L4]
---
Magnetic Field Stabilizer II
---
Power Diagnostic System II
---
Large Micro Jump Drive
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
Large Shield Extender II
---
Cap Recharger II
---
425mm Railgun II, Caldari Navy Antimatter Charge L
---
425mm Railgun II, Caldari Navy Antimatter Charge L 
---
Large Hybrid Locus Coordinator II
---
Large Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I
---
Large Core Défense Field Extender II
---
Throw some drones in this, adjust the ammo according to your situation and you should go through the mission just fine. However, please note that the Rokh doesn’t have any bonus related to its damage, so bigger target could take more time to take down. If you really want to use Hybrids, Gallente ship could be interesting, like the Megathron.
---
Dude please dont make it to complicate. This ~~might~~ will break the ingame voice / sound!
---
He probably had something locked or shot something. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
even so; does CCP condone this kind of insider trading? Granted that if you were to ban CSMs over it you likely wouldn't have any CSMs left... but I think that just proves that there's a huge culture problem amongst that group of eve players.
---
We sometimes forget the super/titan helicopter dicking you guys go for vs subcaps.  You have to forgive us, you spent so long keeping then docked vs equal numbers we sort of forgot you had them.
---
I guess we all know what happens next ;)

&gt;Official announcement from your company regarding Larkonis Trassler
---
&gt;2009-09-08 - By CCP Xhagen - EVE dev-blogs
---
&gt;2009
---
Literally *ten* years ago.
---
So you've found two leaks/NDA/white paper breaches in the 13 years the CSM has been running, and one guy who said racist stuff that was blocked from becoming part of the CSM and that equates to:-
---
&gt;Every CSM in my memory had at least one member kicked for leaking or some other shady shit.
---
It's like Falcon said - extremely selective memory.
---
And you don't think we couldn't come up with subject matter experts from "each area of the game?" Also, how the heck would you select which ones get to be on the CSM? Cause if it's voting, heh.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/a-csm-delegate-resigns
---
Manny also kicked for leaking Cap changes.  
---
Those are just off the top of my head.  If you go back through the market and look up the bottle neck items for each new major feature (citadels, excavators, etc.) you'll see massive spikes/purchases after CSM was notified, but before it was announced.  There have been plenty of posts detailing these with graphs.  I'm not going to spend my time finding them all for you when a google search will do it.  I'm certainly not imagining it.  My point stands. 
---
Aha , useless post , useless comment , useless alliance I guess 
---
What im trying to tell you is that you don't get to decide.
---
Do i believe he cheated? Yes.
---
But only CCP can really tell how he utilized the broadcasting and decides the metrics on what is cheating.
---
the only relevant fact about numbers is that imperial legacy is at least twice as big as the north
---
How many wormholes actually care that HK got evicted? Anything that goes into a hole ceases to exist until it comes out so just occupy a different hole or STFU. This is why living in jspace is hard mode even with numbers :)
---
Both?
---
I have no problem with overpriced skins, I have a problem with the lack of cheap skins to go with them.
---
I still would have bought the Hazard control for my Nag regardless, but why can't I get a $2 version for a rifter?  Why did CCP give us 100 shitty skins in event sites for free when they could have charged 99 cents each and made a million dollars?

yea I fucked up
---
👏👏👏👏👏👏💦💦💦👋👋👋🕶👞👞👞
---
yeah, we all know what will happen when the campaign "officially" starts... oh, that has already happened? 
---
Should have thought about that before driving TEST to side with the Imperium I guess.
---
Ehh.  MINI-AAR 
---
Stuka fleet caught 6 Rorqs in an Enormous.
---
1 didn't have a PANIC, other 5 were into PANIC within a few minutes of us getting in there.  
---
We bubble fucked the Rorqs and dropped stop bubbles in the direction we expected them to come in.  With the cyno-inhib up they ended up cynoing in their supers and titans a few hundred off and we were able to play some more games with bubbles to make that a mess.  
---
Basically they kept warping titans onto us to try and DD, I lost one of my two chars to one of the DD's as we'd lost some CMD Dessies by then and the others were on CD so they couldn't jump us out of range of the DD but in their attempts usually a carrier would get out of position and we'd take advantage of their mistakes by piling on whoever was farthest away or least convenient for them to support.  
---
Also...they didn't drop much in the way of FAX at all...I remember like one apostle on grid and I feel like he came in later.  
---
We had a few good bomb runs on the Eagles as they warped into the bubbles and we caught them out.  Not our cleanest bomb runs but they largely got the job done.  
---

How risky is mining Low Sec in a Venture? For PVE I'd have a couple of drones and a shield booster to keep the pirates at bay but I was wondering if the chance of being killed by another player is quite high

---
Yes, Panfam definitely should have NIPed test just so they didn't go towards goons, who would have known TEST were afraid of equal numbers.
---
It's good.    I drank the koolaid  :)
---
Agreed, we should only allow representatives from groups who have never had a player removed for leaking, such as the Imperium.
---
hahahaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
they ignored the T3D group too which is why they ended up making AFs worthless for 3 years as the T3Ds did their job better.
---
they should put the megathron police skin into an lp store or the new eden store
---
&gt;check market swings for new modules/mechanics - there's always a huge spike right around when CSM was notified, but well before it appeared on SiSi
---
Can you proivde a source?
---
I for example remeber two cases:
---
Before the patch when plex was split in 500 pieces. And that was refuted for two reasons: price went up before the patch due to patch day speculation and the csm. Found out later than the beggining of the spike.
---
Meta modules going up beofre they released alphas.
---
I can remember one for sure(oddly i cant find the source now) that got banned for speculatiob on pirate bses when they changed them way back.
---
Also wasn't noobman permabanned for leaking stuff to his alliance mates? 
---
if u write a tl;dr book on why its not fun, its probably just not a good game
---
Yeah, the North dogpiling on TEST after WWB was equal numbers.
---
I'm not going to be arsed to go back and find every post with graphs detailing the market swings that could only come from CSM leaks.  There's plenty out there.  Feel free to do some digging.  And before the brigade of "your accusation, you have the standard of proof" begins, this is reddit, not a courtroom.  I've provided some proof, and I know there's plenty more out there.  Obviously I'm not alone in remembering this either.  
---
To the bigger point - even when the CSM doesn't act in its own group's self-interests, it's ignored by CCP.  Plenty of evidence that CSM/focus groups warned against Rorq changes, carrier ratting, etc.  CCP ignored them.  My point still stands - the group does little good, is ripe for problems, and should be abolished. 
---
In my defense I bought the character.  The name is awful
---
I always jump the biggest ship first too. Gotta stretch out the hole so the little ones fit. 
---
Reason: You're retard.
---
I would be willing to throw a few year salaries down on the bet that the CSM has, on numerous occasions, influenced CCP and deterred then from making incredibly impulsive decisions that would have been bad. 
---
I would also include on this bet that everyone who doesn’t think the CSM does anything probably doesn’t have the slightest clue about what they are talking about.
---
If you add up everything dropped in killmails, you will end up with a number much larger than what's actually there. Many wrecks get destroyed (bombs, smartbombs, bosons), other stuff is looted during the battle and ends up in another killmail a second time.
---
I could even settle for the current 10member csm we have now but they communicate similar to a focus group. No propietary info and we can all see what is said but only the csms can contribute to the diacussion. 
---
Maybe they should come back as small anchorable like the POS guns used to be and with reasonable anchoring limits. I figure a laser mine having either 2 M sized guns or 1 L sized gun with so-so tracking and \~30-45km range for M size and 50-70km range for L size.
---

---
First I thought "Great, another fucking Hitler caption", but honestly laughed my ass off. "I just wanted to be rich!" -- fucking gold.
---
I love your consistency.  My original point included CSM members removed for being shitheads, so the Imperium/CFC would still be banned. But I'd settle for shitheads who don't leak over shitheads who do.  
---
TEST is sadly becoming very akin to goons in their frequent use of kool aid. It makes me sad tbf :(
---
Please tell me that you tried to check if this is just not a graphical bug on some titan ... or keepstar. 
---
'cause reddit circlejerk, more goons and legacy members than north members.
---
can you convince brisc retard to leak and get caught tia querns
---
The issue people have with delve isn't the fact delve exists or that you have a response fleet to their aggressive actions. The issue people have is 1) The total quantity that can be safely pulled out under that umbrella (A problem that disrupts risk/reward and further encourages all of eve into big blobs) and 2) the fact that even when these people fuck up horribly they still live (A problem with cyno mechanics usually).
---
I don't even know that it's a culture problem amongst the CSM.  I just think the temptation to make a few billion/trillion isk is too great and there's always going to be leakers.    
---
It would be nice if CCP told us of how much of an impact the CSM is actually having. But I don't think they will, because who wants to share with their playerbase how many of their shit ideas are being shot down?
---
Fuck that, hunting ratters is assymmetric warfare. Eve is supposed to be risky, so your ratters need to be on the ball and/or you need to defend them.
---
Don't read it then cunt lmao
---
You're Nyxed sunshine!
---
It's not worth it the risk for those ores, you might as well go to null which would be much more profitable for similar if not safer risk, or stick to highsec.
---
You are the one making these outrageous claims, yes you CAN be arsed to find every post with details, that's how accusations work.
---
Based on the response here, I am not the only one who feels this way.  Makes you wonder if your system is working as intended, or if it's a problem.  How are those player counts these days?  The real players, not the bots you guys struggle to get rid of?

&gt; Hey man, in every case, every year, there is some major metagame or drama happening surrounding CSM.
---
Welcome to EVE Online.
---
&gt; You think players trust these people? Yeah sure, some of them are well meaning, but its blatantly clear they're only there for "their guys" and not the greater community.
---
They're politicians, whether they're trusted or not is their problem, and yes, they're there for their guys - the people who voted them in. If they break the rules, it's our problem. If a delegate breaks the rules, there are channels through which to report it. 
---
&gt; We are at a point on the internet and communications ingame and out of game, that CCP doesnt really need CSM due to how easy communication between dev and player actually is.
---
You'd be very surprised at the level of filtering that needs to happen in order to cut through the noise and get to the signal. The CSM helps immensely with this. They don't just come to us - we go to them for feedback too as a sounding board.
---
&gt; Also, if CCP truly cared about CSM, then voting would take place within the client and CCP would actually make it seem like a big deal through the launcher or client
---
Voting inside the client is still a dream for us, something we want to do. Now that we have other systems in the client that produce popups and information, we're a bit closer. We'd really like in-client voting to be a thing.
---
They could make it a deployable stucture that sits there while you are on grid or something.  And maybe not have it be a damage mine, more like an emp mine that would decloak ships...  
---
Woah now, Its only January.

For real though, Brisc and The Judge are the most useless CSM members we have. Their attitudes suck, they have 0 regard for the player base or well being of the game. They are obviously biased and have their own(and alliance) interests. But the CSM will continue to be filled with useless members like this as long as it's a mouth breather popularity contest.
---
Then again why would I ever expect any sort of professional iteration of the CSM? This is CCPearlAbyss we are talking about, I should know better. After all CCP Falcon lives for coming on reddit and talking all sorts of unprofessional shit to the players. So I guess it's just PAR for the course. 
---
Yeah but then they would be in test.
---
how does one get it so far? 
---
The first couple days were great...
---
What i used to do when i wanted a friend to speed up reputation was to have a lvl4/5 char (me) that would start the mission and my friend would just stay be my side helping kill (frigates mostly) and since you can share the rewards, he quickly had enough rep to do it by his own.
---
omg they are so fucking terrible, are you actually serious?
---
Yes please, then I can sell my voice to pay for EVE instead of mining/ratting :D

Wait... What strip miners did you use? Cause if you used T2s did you add the ammo? Cause I know that makes a HUGE different. Also with a corporation who is doing a mining operation with boosts you will see a HUGE difference. Cause that orca (in if high sec) or that roqual that you see can make a huge difference I'm mining especially since you can compact your ore with a roqual and keep mining for longer.

Returning player from around 3 years ago, What happened to Space monkey alliance? Also where is the best place to find some large null sec corps to join?
---
I have been preaching this for years. Keep your friends from eve, but stop playing eve. CCP will get the point or go bankrupt.
---
Stop !         
---
You people make this narrative more and more appealing to me !            
---
That's laughable.
---
CCP's interference explains a lot.
---
Hi, I intend to join one of the big nullsec alliances and ended up with 2 questions: if I decide that I don't like the community and want to join another big nullsec alliance, is it possible or will I be rejected due to security concerns? Are the systems overfarmed or will I find some place to rat with a carrier or mine with a rorqual?
---

At last a weapon to surpass metal gear!!
---
How did the gallente shuttle ecm?
---
CCP is the problem. We could have the best CSM reps ever, but the issues would remain.
---
I’ll give you 3.50 and a sandwich, final offer
---
Their standard of evidence is trash. They see a market module experiencing an upward trend and immediately ascribe it to a leak, rather than behaving like a human and understanding that correlation is not causation.
---
Goons max/min what is given to them. If rorqs didn't get buffed, you would just see belts with 2000 procs mining.
---
I believe this technique is called "A swing and a miss"
---
We can't put up money for good improvements, all we can do is stop giving money for shit ones. Then upper management sees slumping sales and decides to double down on new Jesus features that they can hype, because that's what worked for them before.
---
overused meme
---
Solo keepstar kill waiting to happen...
---
vni ratting is and will be utter boring. there is lots of diferent ways to earn isk but since you said farm 6/10 and 10/10 i give my opinion.
---
You can do 6/10 and 10/10 with a vni... but it will take a lot of time to finish..
---
There is certain other options but solo SB machariel for low SP char is not the best option.
---
My advice is get skills to an ishtar and you can use that for everything, 6/10, 10/10, Havens, rally points to farm the escalations.
---
Fitt the ishtar with 1 or 2 SB to kills frigates that get close and use the drones to haze the rest.
---
When are you running them? I do lots of Abyssal sites at various times and see the proving conduits in almost every run. 
---
I have zero interest in going in but I do check and double check that I'm heading towards the exit and not to pvp.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74558777/ this is USTZ isn't it? 7pm EST.
---
and this one https://zkillboard.com/kill/74538136/
---
sure there aren't many but there aren't many in any time zone.
---
&gt;There are, the rule is that the voting is open and fair.
---
It's open but not fair. For example you can't vote to diaband the csm because any candidate that would run for csm disbandment would be struck from race bu the devs. 
---
well by that logic why don't we invite more botters to the party to increase those sweet loot buyback profits.
---
but i guess you prefer to protect the people that help your space cult get richer until the content stagnation kills eve for goot
---
They are basically the same these days, i remember when TEST/Legacy were the only anti GOON and anti PANFAM coalition out there, we need more coalitions not mega coalitions
---
aw someone ran out of steam
---
I barely know how to fly a super and I know having half of the doomsday volleys out of range of everything isn't good for anything.
---
Lmao buy more jecties idiot god
---
&gt; if I decide that I don't like the community and want to join another big nullsec alliance, is it possible or will I be rejected due to security concerns?
---
Very unlikely.
---
&gt; Are the systems overfarmed or will I find some place to rat with a carrier or mine with a rorqual?
---
Goons mostly leave in one region and there are 30k of them. You might have free anoms near the home system but for sure around it. Just make sure you apply advices about how to rat securely.
---
&gt; What happened to Space monkey alliance ?
---
Short and polite answer is that they collapsed under their own incompetence. Actually I don't think there is a long version.
---
&gt; Also where is the best place to find some large null sec corps to join ?
---
Most don't put a lot of adverts, people know them by name. Look for TEST, Pandemic Horde or Karmafleet if you just want a place in those alliances.
---
I mean whats worse, not being heard, or being heard and then ignored
---
&gt; Sarc
---
me being in a sig is ironic?, go take your pills old man
---
If the region is in FW space, relatively risky. Most importantly, it would be incredibly not worth it. You could run FW plex and get about  10 times the isk ...
---
No, virtually all Test fleets are SRPed. The 'SRP: Yes , blabla token blabla" part is a formality caused by the FC clicking a box to create a SRP token for the fleet/ping for bureaucracy reasons. If a ping says "SRP: No", there'll usually be an annoying second ping saying something like "shit I forgot the SRP token, here it is"
---
Just a couple weird fleets like an FC handing out free ships or doing something weird/silly won't be covered.
---
Botter found guys!
---
Snuff man bad
---
Wah wah wah
---
My gudfitesssss
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
In NS, unless you are loosing dominance over your own space, enemies cannot dock in those systems, which mean that enemies would have to come from some distance to get to you. And friendlies will defend your space, so it's a lot safer than LS were everyone just roam around.
---
The problem is we have no where else to go and CCP knows this. They know they have a captive audience that they can do whatever they want to and we'll just sit there and take it. 
---
At least in a traditional abusive relationship it's possible to go and find a different human being who will abuse you again. 
---
Is the issue that USTZ players are all just Krabbing, and no one wants to fight?
---
That's because the whole concept is absurd. Wanting to abolish the CSM is a perfectly valid viewpoint, but performing the equivalent of throwing a histrionic fit by electing anti-candidates is silly.
---
Maybe, USTZ just don't fly those sites?
---
You know, I'm kind of amazed that my wonderful advice is downvoted, and yet there is oldman_stone two replies down that is legitimately suggesting a DCU and an armor rep/double trimark setup  with a Large Cap Battery II while nobody bats an eye.
---
Maybe I should try to be more subtle, but holy shit, I might actually be suggesting the better fit between these two.
---
How do you leave out TIKLE which brings half of legacy supers not belonging to Test? 
---
A fully functional electron blaster powerful enough to destroy entire planets.
---
Uh, this is a video game.
---
The previous clip he uploaded is also quality content 
---
Dont they have a max DPS they can take at any given time?
---
Some sort of threshhold. 
---
Way less dense than lowsec, fewer people because nullsec is just so much bigger (accounting for half of all known space)
---
" Short and polite answer is that they collapsed under their own incompetence. Actually I don't think there is a long version. "
---
Why am i not surprised. And thanks a ton! TEST or PH may be my next home as i havent seen much on KF.
---
thank you! for the clear info :) 
---
i'm bought one to try while i skill my drones up it works fine but it is indeed not that fast.
---
good thing the pirates i have to kill are weak agains kinetic and thermal.
---
thank you for your time replying.
---
TIL
---
Or just go spend a little on a bunch of t1 frigs and spend a weekend just dying in FW space, you're bound to get a kill after some time, and is probably the best way to learn PvP.
---
They do not.
---
Mixing passive and active tank is definitely the way to go, not to mention an oversized cap battery II instead of a meta version. Damage Control Unit and Adaptive Nano Plating is also certainly better than Energized Adaptive Nano Membranes.
---
Definitely listen to this guy.
---
yeah gave the rokh a trry and it works fine for now.
---
im training my drones so i can use sentry's and eventually a marauder.
---
but its gonna take some time.
---
Are you asking me?
---
public market and contracts. No new supply. no unlimited supply
---
This amazing... If bots could laugh at the notion of their enemies fighting each other instead of them that is what they would be doing right now. 
---
Karmafleet is a corp in Goons, sorry forgot to add that

Fuck im gunna need a second bowl of popcorn for all this butthurt in this thread. 
---
Goons are a handy scapegoat, but the issue really is that large alliances get represented because their candidates are known to enough to get votes, whereas smaller alliance and non-sov players don't have enough of a cohesive unit to select a candidate from (and if they did, getting votes would be tougher).
---
Ideally having a balance of X number of seats for null alliances, X number for WH corps, X number for non-sov alliances (LS/HS), and X number small corps (no alliance, less than 100 members, maybe other group types I've not thought of. Divvy up the seats for each section based on player allocation to the groups. It would mean that there's more null voices, because that's where there seems to be the most players who will vote, but the other groups get at least token representation.
---
...so for the next time someone asks me why our KS gunners list is so small
---
I'm not sure but I'm just surprised that I see them nearly every run and you don't. This is just running T3 fierce sites, no particular type just what I've picked up in runs and when I don't see a proving conduit I do a bit of a double take and wonder if I ran an agitated by accident.
---
thanks.
---
so they were given out as part of a limited time event or were they available for plex some time back? 
---
if there are renters you are highly likely to find bots but if you find any report to CCP and the alliance whos space it is  eg Test, INIT
---
they will investigate and i know in INIT. we purge bot corps once proven  i think 4 have been kicked in as many weeks
---
don't do it
---
SMA started a war with the IWantISK casino. Their coalition went to bat for them and embroiled itself in what became The Casino War. SMA decided they didn't want to fight anymore and left their coalition. Then SMA imploded.

You calling other people pets when your in a pet alliance of the largest coalition in the game is irony kidda 
---
Thank you, I would not wish to call you a retard for ignoring the millions of Plex already in the economy that CCP don’t give a shit about if they are redeemed or not, as they affect Nothing about their bottom line, I imagine a “duh plex are bought for monez” response satisfies simple minds though. keep it up, looking at reality will only disappoint you?
---
exhumers are better
---
You indeed need to redeem it. You can find the redeem interface via the neocom pannel. Then you will get an item to activate the license and you will be able to activate it in the list of skins through the fitting window.
---
right click -&gt; trash it
---
Define "alone". Does being alone mean working within your coalition? Cause we work within PANFAM? Test seems to not be able to do anything with Goon support. 
---
When us the invasion going to start?

But here you are complaining that they AREN'T interfering. Which is it? Are they interfering too much or not enough? 
---
[Bluetrals = functionally blue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpbdGnJbneE) 
---
I think there is value in dealing with a more core group of players, sitting down with them in Iceland etc. Often times the issue at stake is not isolated on a single area of the game, so you need people from more than a single background. Focus groups are too big to accomplish these.

Then people lost interest because, shockingly, if people were that interested in instanced pvp they wouldn't be playing eve in the fitst place.  Another case of ccp appearing to have no understanding of their playerbase or why their game has been a success.  Not saying it's a bad feature, just, why?  It's like a barbecue joint suddenly doing a big salad promotion lol

&gt;graphs detailing the market swings that could only come from CSM leaks
---
Is it completely impossible that such swings were caused by anything other than people informed by CSM leaks? Did you report any of them?
---
You provided proof of some removals, no one denies that some people have been removed. Your pretty vague claim made it sound like every CSM (in your, undefined, memory at least) was corrupt. 
---

Assuming even distribution, this comes out to an overall average of about 30M.  My own numbers for WH space show about 20M, but then for whatever reason I tend to get more BR sites
---
How would you fix "rorqual mining"?
---
Might log in for the first time in a year just to get that Nyx skin. 
---
Not selectively enforcing the EULA is what they are supposed to do. You did NOT misinterpret what I said as aversion to that.
---
Well the old stations were always there... just the owner changed from time to time. But you had ways to get back to them if needed. Not the same thing as ripping the rigs out of a structure, destroying them and then having to obtain them again in a new location.
---
But the point is that CCP's goal was to move industry into nullsec. Very few people could be fucked to do that in POSes before and stations were too limited. One upside to POSes was that they could be unanchored and moved without sacrificing anything.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like citadels. But I must point out that once the structure is dropped and properly rigged, it's owner has all the incentive to stay and not fight over new territories as he wouldn't just be leaving the structure behind, he himself would practically have to destroy it.
---
I don't like the constitution of the CSM but nobody can blame players for electing whoever they want. The system itself is the issue.
---
I was a big CSM skeptic until I knew a few people who were on it and they explained to me that my impression of what the CSM does was wildly different than what the CSM actually does.  Having been on the CSM myself now I can tell you that regardless of who is on the CSM the entity itself has immense value if only as a final pre launch feedback mechanism to CCP.  Those people(CCP) love the game and want to make it good but inside the building occasionally they may not view a feature or addition to the game through the same lens that a player would and having 10 informed players be able to provide candid commentary in a way they can digest easily and pivot from.  
---
As far as the leak shit goes sometimes people are stupid and I cant let something some rice crispy dicked idiot did years ago affect the job I was elected to do. Do previously leaks affect what the CSM is told these days? Probably.  Can the CSM still affect positive influence on the game even with that trust issue? Yes.  
---
It's going to be weird having to tell TEST you aren't breaking the NIP while letting SkillU stage from your system to attack Legacy members, i look forward to that dramallama
---
I understand your point, EVE is a terrific sandbox. Getting consistent fights is not easy. I’ve been on hours long roams and killed 1 thing. The idea of being able to just click a button and get a fight appeals to me. And then you’ll tell me “Zaenis, you’re playing the wrong game”. Maybe you’re right, but I’m not space rich in any other game :(
---
&gt;the spawn rate is too low.
---
Or maybe USTZ is just full of risk averse krabs that don't enter the PVP room even if it spawned? 🤔
---
well see I would get into abolishing them but one, im turning 16 in 2 months prior to this post, 2 I hate politics, 3 I don't as much care.
---
I miss you Vily
---
They were in range lmbo 
---
Honestly I think a good idea would be breaking up CSM seats to different categories. Like x seats go to nullsec players, x seats go to wormholers etc 
---
It’s looking like this might be the true problem.
---
or 50 Chimeras input broadcasting in Deklein ...
---
Just keep digging your little hole, while your down there look up realized and unrealized profits. 
---
On the subject of leaking though I dont get how someone who leaked something years ago invalidates the institution of the CSM.  So something was leaked.  Does this make thousands of man hours spent in discussion between the CSM + CCP invalid?  
---
By that rational if anyone ever betrayed your Corp or Alliances trust you should dissolve them both.  
---
This train of thought starts to wear thin after several years of overnights.
---
It must the be residue of objective truth and righteousness. Sorry about that, sometimes I get distracted from dropping all these truthbombs.
---
I mean if they tied it to a new structure I cant see it being a bad thing for the game. Dscan means almost nothing in nullsec as you know whos in your system.. 
---
A Wher by the way.. Lol 
---
Yea the CSM is corrupt. No shit! They are useless and its a bunch of dudes changing the game how they want, not what is best for the game. Like the CSM let fozziesov get through. That tells you enough.
---
There TOS and EULA decides if he was cheating.
---
Running pirate escalations in a police ishtar.... taking RP to another level!
---
I seriously doubt theres a single lowsec pvp expert in the entirety of goonswarm. Like maybe you can have a nullsec big bloc pvp expert, and an industry expert, but other than that theres really nothing that goons are good at no.
---
Nice to meet you ms Lmao
---
Doubt you have any clue.. sorry sir.
---
When is the TEST invasion of Geminate going to begin?
---
Consider using a nearer trade hub. A DST like the Mastodon would be good assuming you're hauling more than a couple of hulls.
---
Why dont they just adapt
---
You could say that. But do you know who wrote them? 
---
So it fits the current owner perfectly then.
---
A number of years ago When a dev created a dojo (arena) the player base was very vocal against it and it wasn’t implemented.  Fast forward several years ccp implements an arena that is gated by pve. So they basically took the dojo which was known to be hated and slapped on pve which is anathema to a good percentage of their pvp player base. It’s no wonder it’s no doing well.  
---
It already started pre-Dominion, as a certain alliance packed a whole region full of CSAA's 6 months before the actual patch that made Titans and RR-Supers OP, what made them instantly from a small elite group into the supreme predator for years ... But I guess they just had the right feels...
---
You mistakenly think the CSM player volunteers have ANY authority whatsoever regarding what goes into the game itself. Being on the CSM does not make you Fozzies boss.  It just means you get to talk to him once and a while when he chooses to engage you in conversation.   A conversation he can take all or none of your feedback from.  
---
&gt; everyone who doesn’t think the CSM does anything
---
Of course they do something. Rmt for leaks and market manipulation is more of a "something" than nothing, after alll.
---
Therefore CSM should be jettisoned together with CCP Con.
---
Except when you've got fifty accounts per member all voting for the same person. 
---
I'm not a game design expert. But for rorquals, I would nerf the panic module. I would also keep the volume of anomaly and moon spawns the same but reduce the size of each rock so a rorqual has to be more active. This would reduce the ease of multiboxing armadas of them. I would also take a look at cyno modules in general. I liked the idea that was put forth about them having a spool up time. Maybe a specific high slot module you could use to stop one firing off like you can when you scram an mjd'ing ship when you see the spool effect.
---
They have influence though and the ability to tell him when it is bad.
---
You are dumb.
---
There were obvious leaks never admitted by CCP like the pre-Dominion-Leak ... so its more than that
---
Maybe we should only let members of GoonSwarm Federation onto the CSM, statistically that should reduce the amount of NDA Leaks to about... 0.00%.
---
In terms of change the CSM has changed radically since it's inception and is hardly recognizable in it's structure and policies. I think it might help to look at the CSM BEFORE CSM 11 and AFTER CSM 11. 
---
During my term on CSM the white paper was completely  re-written, the CSM was given new coordinators who helped break down some communication barriers, and we were introduced to a new team lead for NPE (CCP Ghost). 
---
In short, The Future Starts Slow\~  
---
I, too, make sweeping accusations about a 35,000 character alliance. But, hey, let's say it's true. You don't think we could buy off one of the existing ones with the promise of our massive voting girth?
---
The ore anomalies have spodumain rocks with 1.2 million m3 in them.
---
I'm gonna remove your post because you're starting to piss me off
---
Agreed -- multiboxing and multiple account having is restricted solely to members of Goonswarm Federation, and no one else in the game is allowed to have more than one account. This is an injustice that must be corrected.
---
One vote per credit card. No votes for alphas. One coalition member max. 
---
was it offensive in some way?
---
Was that ever confirmed to be due to CSM leaks?
---
Lets randomly choose a person from a crowd and volunteer them to attend weekly space meetings during their real work week, spend thousands of dollars of their own money travelling, and volunteer 2 entire weeks of their vacation time to go talk to people about a video game in Iceland.  A recipe for success.
---
pls dont tell them but we are working on the inside to make them even more bloodhungry ;)
---
At this point the CSM is totally useless and is a complete PR move so they can parade around the "we have an elected player council" line at every opportunity. 
---
I feel for the devs CCP forces to interact with the CSM. 
---
But I'm sure we'll get a couple of Falcon posts in this thread to set us straight, its the exact right type for him to show up. 
---
I think his argument was more "because there was a leak CCP stops telling the CSM useful stuff so the CSM is useless". 
---
Oh get a life buddy
---
Well technically he wasnt wrong
---
wasnt hard knocks evicted why are they still around?
---
That would require them get off their ass and vote. When it comes to voting in CSM, pubbies are even lazier than goons. 
---
You don't need to bring them to iceland to gather feedback. You just need to do surveys with representatove selections.
---
Your posting is offensive in every way 
---
who cares about lore?
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Shit beat me too it. Damn! This has got to sting. 
---
Hope you're having a lovely day amrass :)
---
That is evidence for 1 CSM, not all 14 i think we're at now?
---
Now you'll need proof for every...single...CSM having a person resigning.   Nice sweeping statements.
---
But I like it
---
Got it, thanks!
---
It was confirmed by me seeing all the CSAA go up some 6 months prior the patch and seeing the built ships (Armor Titans/Supers) jump out of the region in the last weeks before the patch. 
---
Just like Goons today, at that time this certain group had 3 or 4 CSM-Members ...
---
In your opinion was I a "shithead" when on the CSM? 
---
There goes Merkelchen trying to inject logic into an argument based on emotion.....  This should end well.
---
Some of these discussions to get to the root of something take hours and need to be revisited several times throughout the week. As much as I dont want to give up 2 weeks of my life to go to Iceland I think that one part is fundamental to the CSM succeeding. There are just too many people involved and too much detail to sort through for this to be a 30 minute web meeting. 
---
Talk shit, get hit, friend.
---
That's a classic, unrealistic argument. I know killing ratters is fun, but the thought that someone is going to be able to 'defend' them is laughable. If say a VNI is tackled by a retribution, there is no way you're getting there in time before he's dead. Unless you're sitting in system, undocked, waiting for something to happen. Your other option would be to camp a gate at the entry point, which is pretty fruitless since Intys and T3's just ignore bubbles and wander in anyway. Combine that with the fact that cyno's allow anyone to drop in anywhere, and you've created a system where it's virtually impossible to defend a smaller target or secure your space in general, even when you're actively trying to do so. 
---
We still hear a lot of stuff I would consider useful. 
---
Something worth fighting over would be nice.
---
Surprise, CCP doesn't give a shit about people who only play on one account and let the biggest whales ell them why to do. 
---
And when he completely ignores it?
---
nothing
---
Don't abolish it, just put relevant people in it.
---
e.g not brisc retard
---
Most of the people on the csm doesn't know enough to get to the root of something.
---
Take brisc for example.
---
We all make mistakes.. I remember a certain fort in hed that didn't quite work as you planned.
---
Lowsec, nullsec, and wormhole space all have different mechanics.
---
Lowsec means no bubbles, which means different styles of play, different mechanics, and different methods are available for fights.
---
Lowsec also has gateguns which means that they can't shoot non hostile targets unless they have logi/fleet/large ship etc.  When most small gang pilots fly smaller more lightly tanked stuff, this is a big issue.
---
IMHO this is why for the past couple of years, spearheaded by k162/QS/Volta/GH, the movement has been to a nullsec static based wormhole home to raid out of.
---
1b
---
/eyeroll
---
Thank you for your support. 
---
lowsec is fine to be honest, it's Null that really needs to be changed
---
nothing fuck off ccp is just going to ruin it
---
¨Hey guys im damn tired of you guys bothering my rorquals, cant you just go to lowsec so we only have to fight our bluetrals
---
It kind of needs a good overhaul in general, and it's been needing it for such a long time that it's becoming absurd.
---
But if I need to point a "small" QoL improvement that would make things a little better, I think that would be Defensive Plexing... just get rid of it, make everything work like Offensive Plexing where you need to get in there with a ship capable of fighting the NPCs out there instead of just orbiting a button like a twat hoping noone comes shooting your unfitted t1 frig so you don't have to stop printing LP even for those few seconds that it takes the other to warp off.
---
Reworking Tier rewards like suitonia once wrote about would also be great, but I don't think that counts as a "QoL" improvement.
---
A nerf to anomalies in NS to make NS isk making not as vastly more secured and available as it is right now, a rework of content in LS (moons / PI / industry), a rework of FW space (not able to rework, fix missions being available if you own the system, remove the stupid modifier if you are the loosing side), and probably rework isk making as new players have little incentive to try and get how mission work when they can just afk in a VNI.
---
Eve has sound?
---
PvPers want to kill miners not because of the challenge, but because they know its good for the games and its economics health. Every Rorq saved by an umbrella is another nail in the coffin of this game ...
---
Like a nightly isk/bpc or what have you cache that generates content like one per region could be cool. I bet people would come fight for that
---
Whew, he's a quick one.
---
Blank, not researched at all it is 2-2.2 billion. 
---
dumb comment
---
people like instanced pvp they just dont like a dumbass pve beforehand that limits your ship possibilities to a handful of ships that can run the pve combined with no controls so you can have a 20b unkillable cruiser (unless ur afk lol) and if you can both tank each other there was no system to deal with that for months so youd both die
---
shoot a pos
---
Okay superman. Doesn't change the fact that a lot of brave were burnt out.

Exactly the point I made earlier.  Goons didn't do anything wrong packing the CSM.  They operated within the rules to do so.  That's just tough luck for everyone else.  My bigger concern is we've got a system that allows substantial inside information that can be weaponized/monetized and we're giving it to a select group of players.  Human nature being what it is, humans will abuse this info.  Plenty of examples out there.  
---
Don't focus so much on marauders, a well-skilled rattle is where you want to go for now
---
To be fair, we are allowed vote however we like, we are just not allowed to cause dissent against the selected ballot. 
---
Of course I know who you are. We talked about you a lot at the summit. 
---
I would think that with the new data mining capabilities added with into the abyss, certain long held beliefs and notions CCP has had over the years are being challenged by what the numbers are actually showing. Historically when CCP has ignored either the CSM or focus group's recommendations or cautions, there has been more often than not a gameplay result that backs up the concerns brought to CCP's attention. If CCP is going to have the CSM and focus groups, then they need to actually listen to them and make changes before something is introduced into the game. An elected CSM should remain, but each member should be tasked to head and run multiple focus group meetings where the members are drawn from a pool based on their activity tracker data. (So you get people who are very familiar with the topic being discussed) Following several closed door focus group meetings, a list of recommendations should be formed and presented to an open door (all players) meeting. After receiving imput, a final list of recommendations should then be drawn up and presented to the CSM and CCP for summit discussion. 
---
Too much work? Well, then you can stick with the current less than encouraging results.
---
they suck
---
Any word on faction caps being added to LP stores?
---
&gt; They're politicians, whether they're trusted or not is their problem, and yes, they're there for their guys.
---
Some modes of organization players have created in this game clearly have a selective advantage on pushing people to vote. They have discords, forums, voice channels, twitch channels, crowded alliances and coalitions to block vote for them, and all sorts of other mediums, not because they created all those to campaign for CSM (so one might argue they deserve getting elected), but because they need these mediums to enable their very playstyle. Other playstyles often do not have these mediums because they don't need them. 
---
Then these modes of organization naturally become overrepresented in CSM. But isn't this self defeating with respect to your purposes of having a CSM? Do you really not see a problem with certain playstyles being overrepresented on the feedback that is filtered to you? And no, it it false that empire builders can fairly represent others. It is true that people are complex beings, and some empire builder CSMs can offer feedback outside their own ingame interests. There are such examples. That doesn't mean there is truly a fair representation of non-empire builders though. 
---
And the underrepresentation most often shows in small things. For example, if hunters of PvE ships in null (whalers) were proportionately represented as much as users of PvE ships in null, perhaps there would also be a range increase combined with the recent cyno inhib changes (which took 4 years of pushing on the side of whalers). Because as of right now, people easily cyno 100 away their inhibbed friends and doomsday the entire hunting fleet at one go. So perhaps cyno inhib should prevent the inhibbed side from getting capitals into immediate intervention range (without them having to warp). If they had to warp, then the attacking side would have bubbling options, which would create interactive and meaningful gameplay where creativity and intelligence wins. CCP can't know all this unless they immersed themselves in such a playstyle, so they need to CSM. Empire builders can't know this unless they whaled themselves. Thus we need whalers in the CSM body. Just a single example in detail about how underrepresentation works.
---
So if even you don't see even a slight problem with receiving disproportionately more feedback from "people who are there to for their guys", then you might be part of the problem.
---
But because ccp wanted to remove "passive income" I now have to afk-mine the moons ...
---
A maxed Rorqual boosted Hulk with t2 crystals mines 72m3/s, a maxed Rorqual mines 210m3/s, just under 3x a boosted Hulk. You can make an argument about the hulks paper yield being more realistic, and I think it's fair to take away 30% of the Rorquals paper value to account for pinging, drone travel time etc. But that steal leaves it at mining double what a Hulk does.

Actually, from what I've read, you showed up frequently and participated a great deal more than most expected you would.  Given that reputation, I'd say you did your job.  Steve Ronuken is also a good CSM.  Sugar Kyle as well.  But every CSM leaks.  And I think those leaks are more harmful to the game than whatever good the CSM does.  That's why I think the CSM should be removed.  Focus groups or whatever might be an answer, but CCP's response to focus group suggestions is questionable at best.  Either way, I'm voting with my feet and wallet.  Two accounts unsubbed.  Working on consolidating assets to give to old corp mates.  Biomass within the week.  You guys can all fight over whose loot box was the dankest, and argue that space is too dangerous when I'm gone.

&gt;Welcome to EVE Online.
---
I think that having meta rules applying to CSM while at the the summit may alleviate concerns, even if it seems meaningless to you, it may go a LONG way for trust between playerbase and CSM/CCP. 
---
&gt;They're politicians, whether they're trusted or not is their problem, and yes, they're there for their guys - the people who voted them in. If they break the rules, it's our problem. If a delegate breaks the rules, there are channels through which to report it. 
---
If CSM is just a place where eve's biggest political powers have a seat at the table, then we need to consider it something different than a group that's advocating for a community as a whole. This statement is transparent about that, but it is not what CSM is supposed to be. 
---
&gt;You'd be very surprised at the level of filtering that needs to happen in order to cut through the noise and get to the signal. The CSM helps immensely with this. They don't just come to us - we go to them for feedback too as a sounding board.
---
You also run the risk of that feedback going through a secondary filter where a specific issue, or ignorance thereof may actually benefit larger groups over smaller groups where you may not become aware of until it's already caused small alliances to disband. 
---
&gt;Voting inside the client is still a dream for us, something we want to do. Now that we have other systems in the client that produce popups and information, we're a bit closer. We'd really like in-client voting to be a thing.
---
I appreciate the sentiment, and I'm glad that this is something CCP wants as well.  
---
Apologies if formatting is garbage, bad with mobile formatting

Join Horde. No API check and all of the other alliances don't see being in Horde as a negative, so you can leave at any point. 
---
Woah dude, calm down there... it's almost like you're exhibiting an opinion based on reason, common sense and logic!
---
Aren't you aware that's not allowed here?
---
you heard right, same were the facts with splash dmg from torps, enemy launched them and you did hit mwd to station, torps were extreamly slow and finaly it did hit you after 30 seconds on the way, just for the enemy to see that you are now less than 2500 mtrs from station and hes torp will make splash dmg, so kinda OMFG moment.
---
Join Pandemic Horde. You will get fights instantly. 
---
Most of the things the playerbase takes issue with seem to be the result of "ballsy" moves, that is, moves that favor short-term profits while potentially sacrificing long-term stability.  A lot of these problems seem to be the result result that very lack of stability finally starting to bite CCP in the ass.
---
What can I say -- I'm a troublemaker.
---
There has been alot of TESTie dunking the past week. Who would of thought they are garbage without their friends!
---
That has probably happened a few times.  But more realistically and more frequently the CSM feedback could lead to small iterative changes on the initially suggested design for something.  A thousand little paper cuts.
---
Yo is that the Death Star's gun by any chance ? WTB. 
---
good point, back in the days a good L4 spot in Hisec could compete in single-account-income with bad to mediochre Nullsec-Systems, if you knew what you were doing. Now basically there is no reason anymore for newbros from the ISK perspective to put a lot of SP in BS/Marauders to excel at L4s, when a 10-Mil-SP-Char with a VNI is bringing more money ...
---
I agree that the PVE aspect is annoying in the way it limits what ships can feasibly make through to the PVP.
---
Cyno should be revamped. There shuould be multiple versions for each class of ships. And definitely a frigate should not be able to lit up something that can be seen by Titan XYZ light years away. 
---
\- Frig can lit a cyno that can let subcaps (and maybe even limit to BCs) to jump to
---
\- BlackOps can lit up for caps
---
\- FAX can lit up cyno for SuperCaps
---
Also have a different type of modules:
---
\- Light - small amount of fuel, small distance to jump from
---
\- Medium - significant amount of fuel, a little bit more distance
---
\- Large - a LOT of fuel (or a specific type of fuel, that is expensive) - larger distance
---
she dead or what?

I don't know if you've been memeing as a Goon Kool-Aid drinker for too long, or you're serious, or what, but this post and my various comments are not "grr goon."  I've said several times you guys all operated within the rules when you packed the ballots.  We can argue whether a concentration from one group on the CSM is broken or not, but as usual, Goons organized, used the game mechanics, and did better than everyone else.  I think the mechanic is broken, just like I think 40 multi-boxed Rorqs in every belt is broken, but I can't blame the Goons for abusing a legitimate, albeit stupid mechanic.  My complaint is with the CSM as a mechanic, not with the Goons as a whole for working within that mechanic.  Individual goons who leaked or did shitty things are a different story... 
---
Pretty incredible that they somehow managed to make instanced pvp harder to access than organic pvp

Join a Nullsec corp and you can moon mine and make around 250 on an R64 in a Covetor or 200 in a Proc.

It's almost like you're saying that in a democratic election, the person who has the most votes, or the person who can whip the most votes wins, because that tends to be the most common and popular opinion?
---
I never really thought of that. Sounds like a reasonable system for governing... maybe someone should take that up?
---
OP fleets are srp. Fun fleets arnt
---
There are two problems with this idea. 
---
First, just creating the slots with no rules about who can run is pointless. The big blocs can still get whoever they want elected for whatever slot. The only way to be sure that the person who runs as the "FW CSM" or the "WH CSM" is to verify they actually do those thigns. Thus the CCP community team would have to create a whole bunch of rules and regulations in order to implement it effectively. They'd have to define each sector that you want a seat for, then they'd have to figure out the criteria applied for each sector - how long they have to play, what things they have to have done or do. Then somebody would have to go through multiple accounts and verify that somebody qualified to run for that slot.  
---
They'd basically have to turn the community team into the CCP CSM Elections Committee, and that would cause all new headaches. People bitching who didn't get qualified, etc. It's just not worth it. 
---
Second, almost everybody has played multiple parts of the game and has first hand experience of different things. The CSM is no different. I spent 10 years in high sec as a mission runner before I moved to nullsec. Killahbee was a WH guy for a while. Suitonia has done small gang as well as been in big corps. Most everybody has more than one speciality.  That's a good thing. By only getting single issue experts, you're losing the potential broader knowledge and if that area of the game is not on the roadmap for review, the guy or gal in that slot is basically sitting there twiddling their thumbs for a year. That has happened before, and it usually leads to people quitting the game. 
---
The system now is probably the only real way for it to work, warts and all. 
---
None of the examples are from goons/imperium. We know everyone is looking at us with a microscope trying to find some NDA thing we're breaking. Aryth even sat down with CCP at one point and laid out all the things he was buying for the future just to make sure they were aware and couldn't accuse him of using the information of changes that weren't talked about to the CSM, to make money.  
---
This means we're even more cautious with everything we say and do, because we KNOW ccp would love to make an example of us.
---
NCdotte bias confirmed. 
---
There's an upcoming skin that is released at a premium, but all proceeds go to funding a core systems improvements dev team. They're counting on it to be such a hit, that more special interest skins will follow such as shield implant team skin and the hac refresh team skin. 
---
You want to watch yourself with free thinking mate, you're treading on thin ice! 
---
Before you know it, you might actually start having IDEAS... my god, think about THAT! ;)
---
&gt;  But every CSM leaks.
---
Can you provide an example of something I leaked while on CSM?
---
This opinion of Brisc is always stunning to me.  Inside the CSM room Brisc is the most likely to bring forth ideas and views that are not well represented in the room because he is constantly talking to people. I get that him going on a twitch show and talking trash about someone may give the impression he is a prick but hes a guy that cares a lot about the game and devotes a ton of time trying to gather feedback from people outside his null group to try to get it to the Devs.  
---
Unfortunately, on this main (current) character I'm in my friends very small corp.
---
This won't work. The big blocs will simply move folks they want to run into other alliances they're blue to for the purposes of the election and then do what they always do.  That's an extremely easy system to game. 
---
Why would you ping for someone's in game name when you could have sent him/her a private message on Reddit?

cuz ur boring

Please don't abuse the NER tags for a shitpost.  Follow the lead of the guy earlier this week and make up your own news name that sounds official enough to get the job done.

---
that too
---
and technetium
---
goons are experts in reverse psychology, all they have to do to get ccp to do what they want is tell them it's a bad idea
---
CCP wants the CSM, whether the players want it or not. So there's a CSM. When CCP doesn't want it anymore, it will go away. 
---
I am a goon, please nerf rorqual mining. 
---
I've posted several.  Others have posted additional support for my statements.  I've put it out there, and the upvotes and my karma score seem to support my position.  I'm not really concerned with meeting your reddit/internet burden of proof.  
---
I mean the subset of goons that are an expert in anything other than pressing f1 is like 1%, so its not a huge stretch. And how exactly is buying off a lowsec expert going to help you? he wont have any input into nullsec discussions because he doesnt know anything about it, and if they are advocating changes to lowsec that lowsec people dont want they will simply not get voted in next time. But simply arguing that goons will find a way to cheat the system no matter what, so dont bother trying to fix an obviously broken system, is fundamentally stupid.
---
/r/evejobs mate
---
Thanks!
---
cool, thanks
---
My setup porp with good skills and barges with pretty shit skills made 780m in 1:30hrs on a R64 moon a few days ago. Moon ore makes a shot ton. When mining normal ore like Gneiss you make around 100m p/h
---
Thanks, will remove this :)
---
then goons would run WH candidates, highsec market candidates, and industry candidates, etc. even Hard Knocks would admit they have people just as qualified in all of those areas as well as nullsec warfare.
---
You're the worst &lt;3

CCP's said they'd love to have votes by real people instead of accounts, but it's pretty much impossible for them to do.
---
I'll take these posts over shit posts any fucking day
---
No, they don't. We're watched pretty carefully for this stuff. 
---
Pubbies don't get pinged to vote when its time and told who to vote for lmao.
---
Is there anything else to do?
---
Grind ISK, grind kills, grind whatever you are doing....
---
In that case, mining in low sec in a venture isn't that risky if you know what you are doing. Always check local for names you don't know. Have dscan up and check for incoming. Warp out when you see a hostile come into system or a hostile approaching on Dscan. 
---
Yeah im not rushing :) and a rattle might be an option i can fly them bit lack cruisemissile skills. And i totally did NOT lose one already.
---
After that incident i try to fly ships that compliment the skills i already have
---
Thank you. An idea that I had to keep sotiyos relevant was to have the blueprint copies that drop from them be researched, and you increase the price from the lp store and the minerals cost so it would be about double to triple the regular price of a regular capital rather than 10 times the price. That way there is still a reason to run the citadel but the blueprint wouldn't be constrained to just those who run it.
---
Sorry but this is a cheap AF response. It might give you internet points, but it's a bad argument. Firstly, minorities getting f.cked because them "not having means to get people elected" (e.g. money, influence, organization) is a real problem in IRL democracies. That doesn't mean they deserve being underrepresented. Secondly, we praise democracy IRL because it's the best we got IRL. Things go bad when we say "our governors should be handpicked by pope" etc. People abuse it.
---
Same arguments do not translate to Eve. Democracy is not the best way for CSM to get people to offer valuable feedback for the betterment of Eve. "CCP should handpick CSM representatives from prominent people of different playstyles", or "CCP should have permanent focus groups in many areas of Eve (members of which can change yearly), and the focus groups should elect a single member for CSM", does not at all sound as bad as when you say similar things IRL.
---
They were available for Plex several years ago, CCP did a sale on all police skins saying they were being removed permanently from the store. This would have been 2015 I think. 
---
If it was an isolated incident, sure, it could be anything.  But there are way too many coincidences where some obscure item spikes in price around the same time CSM learns of a new mechanic or item that requires that input.  There's a reason a number of CSM members have been removed for leaking - it's not because I'm making this shit up, it's because they leaked information.  
---
It's impossible for me to report these, because I don't have the inside information in advance.  Only the CSM does, which is why they and their buddies are the only ones who can profit. 
---
And to be clear, I'm not accusing every CSM member of this.  But I think it's a fair statement that every CSM year, someone on the CSM leaks something in advance. 
---
can i have your stuff ?
---
lots  off people.
---
As a Vanquisher owner you have hurt my feelings and want to hurt my poor wallet too.  
---
When did I accuse you personally of leaking?  I'm saying every year, someone on the CSM leaks some shit.  Didn't single you out.
---
No one said to "stop trying to fix it." However, I can and will tear apart ideas that don't pass muster. Thinking that you can somehow select a "lowsec PVP expert" without exposing yourself to our infection vector doesn't pass muster, because said expert has to be chosen, somehow. 
---
and then in Jita, every single unit probably exchanges hands multiple times.
---
Everyone on the CSM Contributes, I honestly wouldn't say there is a 'weak' member on the CSM. The number of mentions on the minutes is not an accurate way to determine how much someone has pitched in, there are a lot of cases where discussions are had amongst many people but only one person is recorded in the minutes.   
---
Also while the CSM summit is probably the centerpiece of our discussions with CCP, a lot of the groundwork is laid prior and after the summit by bringing issues up to teams in hipchat and responding to suggestions there. And for example, The Judge puts in a lot of extra work behind the scenes in organising a lot of CSM meetups in Iceland like booking restraurants for dinner/activities, and talking with devs behind the scenes. 
---
The fact that Aryth needed (or felt that he needed) to do that shows that there's a problem within the CSM.  Leaking is obviously a big enough issue that either he or CCP felt that conversation was necessary.  That's a shame. 
---
Then why did you widen the scope of your argument to include "shitheads," when the only people who have been removed for "being shitheads" are us?
---
Eve is the only game I can think of that gives players a semi-official (and democratically elected) forum to weigh in on balance and development.  And one of the most common complaints from players of *any* game is that the developers don't listen to them very much.
---
Yeah, CSM can be a shitshow sometimes.  And yeah, CCP often ignores their input.  But, that being said, it's still the first attempt to do something like this in any game, and I think we should be supporting it as strongly as we can.  If the first experiment fails -- especially if it's the players who make it fail -- then no other game will try it.  Maybe the CSM isn't the best way to do this, but maybe, just maybe, the next game to attempt it will come up with a better model.
---
I'd be happy to talk to you guys about whatever you want to talk about. Just let me know where and I'll be there. If you actually want to know more about my in-game knowledge, I'd be happy to discuss it with you guys. 
---
Dread with a cloak doesn't count.. does it?
---
Missions in general are much more complicated (or just to make it worth it) and longer to do than anomalies. They respawn fast enough to keep running them, you don't need to jump any other systems unless yours is crowded, and you don't need complicated methods with a puller and knowing which mission is good or not.
---
PVE is a pain, and should be as easy to run as anomalies right now (you want more complex / reward, escalation are there),  just not as available to spread farmers / alliances and maybe make it so afk drone boats are not always the most optimal to run every PvE. I'm thinking a nerf to large drone application to smaller ships because it's also pretty ridiculous at some point, even in PvP.
---
LS need easy to run missions, you could pick in almost every system (except for FW, obviously), like a module in citadels you can pull where you can have an office for agents you get a small percent of the reward / LP.
---
Actually, outposts were player built, you're thinking the conqueerable stations.

---
I quoted your exact words, either defend your statement or retract it. 
---
because it was a little silly and was funny.
---
   
---
you must be fun at parties
---
Because my point is that the CSM is a dumb mechanic that leads to either cheating or bad PR.  I don't think every goon is a shithead.  Just like I don't think every CSM is a cheater.  But we've had enough examples of cheating and general bad behavior on the CSM that I question whether it's value is worth the negative.  For real, I think you need to lay off the goon koolaid.  I'm not saying you're the problem here. 
---
I dont think it would be a big difference to what we have now.. Because i still know when you are 12j out.. Wouldnt bother me knowing this 60sec later.. Only if there is a WH in my system it would have an impact..
---
No i don't. Please enlighten me!
---
Guess now I don't have to meticulously plan my revenge.
---
This significantly helps defenders and hurts people who may be trying to drop on ratters or miners as it would totally limit their incoming ship size while the defenders could still pile on titans for days.  It would take existing content off the table which seems like heading in the wrong direction.  The real problem is likely more upstream than just the cyno module itself. 
---
You don't start with 0 skill points.
---
I also regularly see the proving gate in EUTZ, i was actually surprised by the frequency given all the comments about how dead the content is.
---
If you're not seeing the gate spawning at all in USTZ that's more of an issue with the content not being run much at all during USTZ, regardless of if people are interested in the PVP or PVE. Why that is would be interesting to see, as afaik the discrepency between EU/US population isn't wide enough to justify seeing no gates if they have a similar proportional number of abyssal runners.
---
&gt; Can you proivde a source?
---
There's been a bunch of guys pointing to screenshots of market graphs with red lines drawn all over pointing to spikes or dips. It's crazy person evidence.
---
The cases where CSM guys were banned for leaks, there was no spike. Because people who know to keep it quiet aren't just gonna buy out the market
---
Input broadcasting jape aside, you do bring up an excellent point. I've read unrelated arguments in the past about how supercap umbrellas are somehow new, while ignoring the fact that we were already prototyping it when we lived in Deklein with AFK gecko chimeras with medium shield boosters (rats at jump cap) and triage fit.
---
They are. Just us alone (Wormhole Society) have gained dozens of members and even entire corps coming to us from nullsec over these past few months. I used to get a little salty over the ns mechanics and how hilariously safe and brain dead eve had become in certain regions, but nowadays... You spodbrains just keep bluing up and killing content in your space. We'll just siphon off all your active players that want to actually unlock and pew as opposed to sucking rocks :D
---
There is nothing to ruin ...
---
NDA bro
---
Finally something that can oneshot a titan. Death to supers!
---
Then ccp could curate the list of applicants to those who actively participate in those areas or are parts of alliances in those areas. It’s not like ccp has to accept every applicant as a candidate 
---
Yeah I agree it'll have problems as the ones you pointed out, but surely as you said about losing broader knowledge, surely you would gain that in abundance when you have experienced players talking to their specific CSMs about issues of each part of space. I've been doing wormholes for an extremely long time, and I would absolutely like to contribute to a focus group for wormholes if it were ever to happen. It's frustrating not being able to say or try and do something to help, and having comments lost on reddit due to everyone trying to have a say. 
---
I think there could potentially be some thumb twiddling, but each area of space usually have a lot in commons, such as anoms and structures for example and I think you would still have each csm able to contribute to some of the issues that are on the roadmap to be reviewed. 
---
They shouldn't have too, they have plenty of resources by which to research and decide on candidates that best represent them. 
---
If they did an overnight ban, yes. If they wielded the ban hammer at steady rates, the market should hold some. Super prices would shoot through the roof however.
---
I see what the confusion is now.  When I said "every CSM leaks," I meant every year, there is a leak coming from someone on the CSM - from the group.  Not that every single member of the CSM leaks.  I apologize for the confusion.  I have no evidence that you, Xenuria, leaked.  But there is quite a bit of evidence that CSM 11 leaked - Noobman was banned for example.  
---
No problem, fly safe o7
---
I'd be interested in hearing why you think I add nothing - this all seems to be based around WHers disliking the HK eviction, and nothing related to what I've actually been doing. Can you elaborate? 
---
Sorry, already gave most of it away.  Just waiting on a few market orders to sell so I can liquidate the rest.  
---
I guess on this point we are content, no one can blame you for min/maxxing what CCP gave to us. It is what they gave to us that always looks half-assed and not fully thought through.
---
The funny thing is The Judge is actually one of the most effective CSM members I've ever seen. 
---
But as for me, I'll let my record and what I've done speak for itself. I'm sorry you think I'm useless, but I honestly have no idea what is driving this dislike, other than the HK eviction. 
---
Insider trading is a good way to go from CSM member to ex CSM probably banned person. 
---
CCP should approve players to run, and limit it to 2-3 candidates for each seat.
---
Like me with my 32 rorqs and without botting

What an excellent summation all the way to the "you wonder if you gonna have a weird 911 call to do" 10/10

He's not afraid to say what he and the playerbase thinks and while he isn't really specialised in a certain topic like me for solo/small gang or Aryth for the economy, he really cares about the game, asks questions that a lot of us wouldn't think to ask and really helps the conversations flow better, he is really good at explaining problems to CCP in a way where he gets across the point, and helps explain problems in a way that makes it easy to understand for the devs. He also brings up a lot of issues that the general playerbase has. Also does a great job with meeting notes for those who don't make it. 
---
Same with the T3C one. They had a guy trying to represent WH PVP who's entire experience with T3s in wormholes with 13 kills in a cloaky Proteus.
---
&gt;there are way too many coincidences where some obscure item spikes in price around the same time CSM learns of a new mechanic or item that requires that input.
---
How do you know that the price spikes happened when CSM learned about a change if you don't have insider info?
---
&gt;There's a reason a number of CSM members have been removed for leaking - it's not because I'm making this shit up, it's because they leaked information. 
---
Again: I'm not disputing that. I'm asking for why you think there are many leaks. I'm not accusing you of making anything up, I just want to see the evidence that made you come to such a conclusion.
---
&gt; I think it's a fair statement that every CSM year, someone on the CSM leaks something in advance. 
---
It'd be a fair statement if you had evidence to support such a claim, do you?
---
no
---
there are plenty of pvpers that also dont care about isk at all though, fyi. Tons of FW pvpers that can make a months worth of frigates in an hour of fw missions anyway
---
Dude he means every council has at least one leaker not that every member leaks..
---
Very unlikely to get rejected yes
---
No, when they redo the tutorial/NPE they had a lot of feedback that a guiding voice telling you where to click, how to shoot, etc was more appealing to new players and the original voice wasn't available for whatever reason, but there was a discrepancy between the old Aura and the new NPE Aura so they had to replace everything.
---
I own the bank. 
---
Given the nature of the EVE community, there's no way, under any circumstance, that a system where CCP selects CSM delegates would work.
---
Yeah, you're not convincing me. Using phrases like "goon koolaid" doesn't help your case. It's okay to be honest, you know? It's not like you're going to lose any face around here for it.
---
Please explain to me what is wrong with having a list of things you want changed, I mean you can downvote the ones you don't want and I could edit this thread as needed if something isn't wanted or needed
---
I feel like ratting is cool for a few hours then gets really overplayed. While mining isn't really cool from the get go that's kind of the point. It's a relaxing way to make isk vs spaceship combat
---
Don't underestimate the draw of simply guaranteeing that you'll be elected. We don't have to pay in ISK, you know?
---
why not just make it that the gate always appears?
---
Too much influence to the large coalitions, so yeah, not seeing the value here.  It's all meta-game, not game improvement.
---
up rat spawns in ore belts that target excavator drones.  For supers, reduce tracking, increase frigs that scram (or better fing yet, introduce npcs that drop bubbles). 
---
Yes, Noobman did leak. I think the amount of leakers on CSM has gone down sharply as more and more goons have occupied seats. You could if you wanted too make a graph or chart showing how leaks decrease as goon occupancy increases. 
---
i enjoyed that fort truthfully
---
Honnestly, with blingy T3s for high-sec shenanigans, an orca lossmail might well have been cheaper...
---
Pompous, abrasive and ignorant, with nothing of value to add.
---
Somethings, they never change.
---
Make sense !
---
but how will you continue to influence them once elected? im sure tons of people would let goons vote for them and then not do what goons want once elected, not like goons are well liked in general eve playerbase
---
It’s sad to see one of our favored former adversaries leave FW/lowsec.  BLOC saw the writing on the wall 6-7 months ago and left Calmil FW precisely for what has befallen other FW entities relatively recently.

What we have right now is "tyranny of the majority", smaller groups get drowned out by sheer numbers, stifling their opinions.  What we should have is just what you're describing, essentially what real governments do to counteract this issue, separate the voter base into coherent and logical districts so that smaller groups still get a voice.  Gerrymandering is always a concern, but unlike real life, with things like CCP being the only real governing figure, corp histories and character ages, and so on, I think it would be pretty blatant if it was even attempted.
---
The weapon the New Order shares were spent on.   On March 15th James will suicide gank Jita 4-4 with it.
---
What can i say... i had to say something when they claimed they were fighting 1500 ppl in that video... its ridiculous specially since they had the advantage in reality. I do realize that the reality doesnt really count on reddit but it sure does ingame and its the delusional believe in the superior skill of hk that got them killed right there.
---
I agree we should have just not said anything from the start but it is what it is... its not like reddit opinions matter at the end of the day
---
It gets really suss though. For example Snuff are ostensibly lowsec but they do a ton in null, where do their reps go? Wormhole Outlaws live in wormholes but also have sov in Querious that they use. There's people in goons who do almost nothing but gank freighters in high sec, etc.
---
For the last time - if you look back at major game changes, there is almost always a major input spike right around the time CSM gets notified.  We know this, only after the fact, when CSM logs come out showing when certain mechanics were discussed.  It's impossible for a non-CSM/CCP player to know this in real time, and report it.  
---
I think there are leaks every year because it's human nature.  You've just been given information that can make you billions or trillions in game, or provide you with a head start on the new meta.  It's human nature to use that info, even when you shouldn't.  Not every CSM member does this, but enough have.  
---
I've provided plenty of evidence of past CSM members who were banned for exactly what I'm claiming.  This ain't court bro - I don't need to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt.  If you disagree fine, but you're putting your head in the sand. 
---
Ok, let's have all goons on the next CSM. Problem solved. 
---
A guarantee of re-election, of course. Granted, they can go "fuck you, Dad" and rebel despite that, but that applies to any form of incentive.
---
It’s difficult but it’s kinda better than the popularity contest we have now imo 
---
The hell camp existed because of the ass pounding yall were receiving when the server died. Cowards deemed it a great idea to not log back in. As a result you got camped in for a week.
---
Denying the circumstances that instigated it is dumb as fuck. 
---
I'd also add that anyone who thinks CSM is useless has the power to do something about it.  Yeah, run for CSM, and when you get there do the grunt work to get the other CSM members on board with a unified platform of changes that *need* to happen -- and then force CCP's hand.
---
This shit happens in governments all the time.  Sometimes Congress or Parliament is useless, and then other times the members seize more power and make big things happen.  The reason why it's not more common is because it takes a lot of grunt work, compromise, and working with people you don't like to make it happen.  That's not sexy and the vast majority of people are too lazy to make it happen.
---
PGL may be in the running to beat you...
---
Really expecting pubbies to that specially when it's not directly on the game and its on ccps website? Do you honestly think most line members in null blocs go and start researching who that they should vote for lmao.
---
You are delusional if you think they do.
---
shit, i didn't realize my very person was a breach of a nondisclosure agreement
---
What the fuck does brave have to do with anything? Am I in Brave???
---
I would appreciate it if u only can log in 1alpha acc or idk up to 5 omega accounts at the same time.. This would have an impact to a lot of problems in my opinion.. U still can lit ur cyno by yourself or scout arround.. But u cant cloaky camp with a couple hundreds of alts or mine with idk 30 rorqs.. Not sure how much it would affect bots.. 
---
Actually there are entire threads about various candidates on the eve forums of all places where line members from null blocs are asking questions, participating in the process. You should probably fact check this stuff before hitting "Post". 
---
&gt; we are just not allowed to cause dissent against the selected ballot.
---
That part of the sentence sounds borderline dystopian. Not allowed to talk about why you think a different candidate would be a better choice.
---
You literally said in another comment that arguing the CSM was dumb was a valid viewpoint.  That's my entire argument.  So what if a Goon was removed from the CSM for being shitty?  That doesn't make every Goon shitty, and I've never tried to say that.  The CSM is dumb.  It should go away.  That's my entire argument.  You're being sensitive because you're so used to Grr Goon you only see that.  Your issue, not mine. 
---
Sounds like an excuse for losing.
---
Losing local bad all my bots died ccp please fix I can't function without it.
---
While in a perfect world we would have the ability to communicate to CCP without these issues, it's better then having no one representing our beliefs at all. 
---
I see (live) people building Supers and Titans en masse (for that time) many months before a patch is announced that makes this ships from beeing nothing but e-Peens not just into a valid combat doctrine but into the OP fotm for the next years?. I see them jump out of their sieged region just within a few weeks to days before the patch ... but I am sure this was just a dream ... 
---
Fair enough on that one.
---
Honestly, if an all goon CSM resulted in a guaranteed no-leaking CSM, I'd be for that.  I'd prefer to get rid of the whole thing, but if it has to exist and we can guarantee no leaks, sign me up. 
---
How is this meaningfully different than CCP hand-picking the CSM? They can just include two candidates in each "slot" that they feel won't rock the boat too hard.
---
The vexor skin still has the banners from the Yoiul skin... that must be a bug?
---
&gt;not repeated a million times on this sub.
---
the nature of reddit means this post will be lost in a few hours. meaning nobody's gona see it, and even if they do see it. it'll be gone by tomorrow and some other nerd's gona say "hey, we should make a catalog of all the changes we wana see in the game cause i'm tired of seeing the same posts over and over".
---
cycle repeat.
---
I'm sorry that I haven't earned your vote yet. 
---
We all know you are one of them...you just crab hulks, mackinaws, retrievers and the occasional orca.
---
I want the mods to remove this post that would be a good start
---
I'd say the fallout and backlash you would receive would be far insignificant than what you receive due to botting, balance issues and bugs. But say what you're saying is true.
---
Suppose you diversely select a focus groups (like at times do) for 8-12 most important playstyles of Eve. I think a non-arbitrary list of playstyles can easily be made with the help of the playerbase (and then things can be added/dropped later on to improve). These people would be in online comms with developers working in their fields. Moreover, they would select a person who would represent these playstyles on CSM and in Iceland, where bigger overarching issues can be discussed with players of many different backgrounds. In this case, nobody would be able to make it a problem why a certain person is in the CSM and not someone else, which is what I think you are implying by referring to the "nature of Eve community".
---
PS: By the way, I don't want to seem unappreciative. All my points do not mitigate the fact that in any other MMO we wouldn't even get close to having something like CSM; a communication channel to the developers. But current system creates many problems while solving many others. And perhaps there are ways to rethink it.
---
The only null group on CSM that hasn't been implicated in leaking of some kind or another has been Goons. So, I personally don't want the CSM to just be goons which is why I have spent the better part of a year in pandemic horde staging telling to about CSM. That said the only sure fire way to remove all leaking is to only have goons on CSM. 
---
ISD btw
---
&gt; he is technically still eligible to run for CSM
---
Wouldn't his affiliation with themittani.com (or whatever it's called now) make him ineligible, just like it did with Sion?
---
I appreciate the vote of support. 
---
Dude, if you're gonna make a thread about the subject, at least include over a dozen things we constantly bitch about
---
CPP: "There won't be any abyssal damage mods"  
---
Also CCCP: "We're adding abyssal damage mods."  
---
Next: this picture
---
Caracals,Ruptures, Vexors, Arbitrators, Ashimmu(t2fits), Phantasm(t2 fits) all those are kinda cheap and can make fantastic pvp platform. 
---
oh lol, actually ROFL
---
This must be a truly terrible post if I'm agreeing with joecuster.
---
Accusing me of "being sensitive" while frantically denying bias is not a good look, friend. Consider your word choice more carefully next time, alright? What words you choose belie your true feelings on matters, even if you intend to conceal them.
---
they could just make a proving filament and skip the pve part. Even a risk averse highsec carebear like me would probably use them since I would be able to just go in with cheap fits all the time hoping others do the same.
---
But the collective community would loose it's mind over this.
---
Are you serious? Titans have always been of massive importance, in all eras of Eve. Also, you're aware that CCP releases patch notes publicly, right? We typically have 1-2 weeks of notice on major changes.
---
The question remains. 
---
This has all happened before....
---
But does it have to happen again ? 
---
Ah yes, the 4 and a half day week
---
Consider it done
---
What were you targetting with the titan?
---
If CCP wouldn't allow all the shit that makes for safe afk-krabbing like intel bots, you could just roam like it was the usual way in EVE to get fights.
---
Today you have to seed a C2 static null Wormhole, add spys &amp; awox chars to the target area or the likes to get a good fight. Then nobody would need instanced PvP.
---
Nope! The CSM white paper is [no longer in use.](https://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/) (It's at the bottom.)
---
local doesnt work but these skins are simply epic , I will keep giving CCP more money :) 
---
You'd get a lot more of a positive reception if you compiled this evidence and it was as compelling as you claim it to be. 
---
&gt;I've provided plenty of evidence of past CSM members who were banned for exactly what I'm claiming. 
---
What you've done is take the few examples of it happening and extrapolated it into a pervasive issue that has perverted the CSM and requires the entire institution to be shut down. It's the same leap of logic that people make when they say that we should send home immigrants because they've seen one commit a crime, despite there being little difference in the crime rates of natives and immigrants.
---
Hi. 
---
I've been trying to talk to the WH community for the better part of a year. I've been in all the discords, have been actively talking to guys like Exooki, Kelishnikov and others.  I'm in the Praisebob discord and I have random folks poke me all the time to chat about stuff they want to see.  
---
If there's anything about WHs you want passed on to CCP, just let me know. 
---
So you think the majority of null bloc line members are in those forums asking questions to each candidate to decide who to vote for? You have data for that?
---
I didn't say no null bloc line members do their research. You didn't say anything that would contradict what I said so telling me to fact check stuff is idiotic.
---
We know a minority of players use this reddit or even the eve forums but from a few null bloc dudes on the eve forums asking questions means the majority do that to decide to vote. Jesus dude. 
---
Because discord is a faster way of chatting than PMing on reddit. 
---
It's the in-game fit simulation tool. You can drag unpublished QA modules in there to display absurd amounts of damage or tank.
---
The CSM was created in response to the T20 incident, it would only be fitting when they become corrupted.
---
LOL, I have never had anyone tell me that, ever. 
---
You guys really should just sit down and talk with me sometime instead of all this caricaturing. 
---
Because you're the best reddit poster in Goons. 
---
At the time i speak of most Titans were used as Bridges, and you did rarely see one use its AoE Doomsday. The timespan i wrote was not 1-2 weeks but several months before the patch notes went public.
---
What's your going to be when you fail to evict PH from Geminate.
---
Who that
---
That's because they didn't have AOE doomsdays for about 8? years. Also, really, you're going to accuse fleet movements "several months" before a patch to be because of CSM leaks? Do you realize how absurd that sounds?
---
(someone can correct me if i'm wrong) but I believe the CSM was created as a response to the T20 scandal. https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/on-recent-allegations/ The CSM was created as a watchdog for transparency when people were already abusing the system for personal/alliance gains.
---
It's absurd how you fail to read and comprehend ... facepalm
---
For cynos, they could make it so the inib disable people from jumping to the cyno (but the cyno stay active, so if the rorq kills the inib people can jump in). That would help ganking them, as they can just now open the cyno just before the inib and get instant backup.
---
Wait. Is this a CSM CMV?
---
Yea, but people are able to bot carriers.
---
was!
---
In order for what you're saying to be understood, it has to be communicated clearly. You are not doing this when you speak in such vague terms. Feel free to give more concrete examples.
---
So you've psychoanalyzed me based on an internet message board and scientifically determined that I'm "Grr goon?"  Got it.  
---
Bots are another thing. This was just about the multiboxing-abilty and input broadcasting. Thats a different story than botting (which is bad off course)
---
Language is expressive, friend. Use it carefully.
---
It’s an old meme sir, but checks out
---
lol ur salty xd
---
o7 thx for the intel, awox intensifying
---
This is too damn good.  
---
Did they take a boat?
---
You know what else is expressive?  Your autism. 
---
1) CCP selects 8-12 most important playstyles in Eve. A non-arbitrary selection can be achieved by an interaction between CCP and players. I can probably make a good list in 30 minutes.
---
2) CCP selects 15-20 people in permanent focus groups in these areas. Same people can be in different focus groups. People come and go yearly depending on their activity. These focus groups are in online communication (say they have their own discords) with developers in their particular areas. Interested devs join these communications.
---
3) Each focus group selects a member to represent them each year on CSM. CSM goes to Iceland etc like they always do. They discuss the broader issues which involve input from people from different backgrounds. Like ship balance, anomaly reworks etc. While focus groups are for smaller issues that are isolated to particular playstyles.
---
4) CCP enjoys diverse feedback. We get rid of the status quo where people pay ISK to SP farmers to get elected. Meanwhile, nobody can shit on CCP due to not selecting this person but selecting that person into CSM, as there is no direct handpicking. Everybody wins.
---
Please play eve with the sound on?

For anyone interested in the story the proteus engaged m Machariel on gate, my friends Bhaalgorn comes in and he warps off. I had to jump gate. I come back and he was in warp back in and immediately tries to engage me again. Turns out we can shoot back in low sec.
---
And that lads is why we do not take goodfights into Lowsec ,  theres always going to be that dude in a sniping Mael who will gank you to death
---
Really? That's actually kind of great. I would love the idea of directing my money to where I want to see improvements (core systems yespls). I'd rather it be "buy PLEX this way to favor core improvements, this way for HAC refresh", etc.

I enjoyed listening to it. Same way I enjoyed listening to the BoB recordings or the Elo recordings or anything else EVE-related. This stuff is just interesting. Sorry this needs to turn into partisan bullshit for you.
---
It isn't about the eviction. I'm not in HK and I think someone had to do it eventually. I'm pretty sure most neutral parties share the same sentiment. We wanted to see HK go out swinging with every bit of military force they pretended to have in rage(didn't happen), and we just wanted the smug to be honest smug about how many numbers you guys brought and how they just rolled over. There was no epic obstacle to over come because HK just laid down and took it.
---
It's probably generated from the way each of you interacts with the overall community on Reddit or public knowledge of in-game behavior, which for the majority of us that aren't in your own alliances/corps, is the only insight we have as to what kind of people are representing us. 
---
That being said, from what little I know about either of you and the few posts you guys have been involved in(that I've seen)that actually speak to the state of the game or important changes being made, you both openly come off as being solely focused on the benefit of your respective groups and as CCP would say, whoever else is negatively impacted or is overlooked by your representation is just "Collateral Damage." 
---
Your seat on the CSM is something that should be for the well being of the state of the game as a whole, not just for the well being of whatever large group you come from. It's super cool to role play and be whatever badass you want and to shit talk the rest of Eve when you are playing the part of Brisc Rubal, fearless Init. space politician. Super cool and fun.
---
It's not cool to wear your CSM hat and sit there as a CSM member in legitimate(not silly Rage-salt screeching) public discussions , speaking to the state of the game, and coming off as only caring about what benefits you and your alliance/playstyle with complete disregard for the rest of Eve Online. That's when the player base that you're representing wants you to stop being Brisc Rubal, fearless Init. space politician, and be Brisc Rubal, representative for all players of Eve online, big or small. 
---
What's funny is that Second Life and EVE both have ancient spaghetti code and have tidi when there's too big a crowd.

GUYS WE CAN FINALLY BE THE FUCKING CYBER POLICE, WHO IS READY?1
---
It seems to me that the biggest issue is a bad perception of what the CSM does and does not do. They don't have control over what CCP does and does not do so expecting that each CSM will somehow magically fix what is wrong is just nuts. The best they can do is point out the issues they spot with what they are told and suggest alternatives. CCP can listen or not, it's up to them. I imagine the amount of bad changes that were altered or outright canceled because the CSM spoke up about it is probably very significant. Without a group that can be talked to behind an NDA you would not get that.
---
They may not be perfect but I feel the game is a lot better off with the CSM then without it.
---
You are always welcome to harras Delve 
---
Oh no... as somebody who used to do Secondlife stuff Linden is absolutely cancerous when it comes to how they run things...im kinda of worried, not gonna lie
---
Just going to hop onto this comment to ask my question. 
---
I am thinking about joining a nullsec alliance as well and looked at horde but I'll confess I really enjoy pve at the moment, I have a dedicated miner and a dedicate mission runner. I'd like to move to nullsec to gain access to better ores and decent ratting sites but I have a feeling this "pve carebear" attitude might not be appreciated by nullsec alliances? 
---
Of course I'd take part in pvp when it's important like defending systems or what have you but for the most part I'd just like to make as much isk as possible while my skills are training.
---
Is there much opportunity for pve in horde space or is it always pvp mayhem?
---
Olmeca, I think you're underestimating how big a deal it would be if CCP started picking the CSM members.  That would be a massive, massive nightmare. All of the stuff that people say about the CSM now would morph into "these are just hand picked friends of CCP, they don't represent anybody," etc.
---
Democracy is the worst system of government, except for all the others. 
---
There once was a time when we could do it in game. I'm assuming they made it an out of game thing so people don't spam them with useless reports. I definitely don't just report things willy-nilly because I have to login to the website. I'm usually only reporting actually serious things nowadays. Unlike in the past you could just report anything quickly.
---
Yes, this is pretty much the only logical solution. Taking players of all different play styles, different size groups and special interests. Not sure why CCP didn't implement it like that in the first place. Even more so after seeing how many Goons have been on the CSM and not thinking hmmm even if there's no actual benefit to Goons, shouldn't we prevent the players for being able to allude to them having some control by limiting the amount of seats they get.......
---
You had vastly more in place, that HAC fleet was only lucky to get in with rage rolling, a patchwork fleet of so many people from different alliances, and fighting for hole control you had the numbers advantage, you have the tactical advantage of fleet comps. You want to count in Horde that was ready to come in how many were triggered and had to be triggered for this to be a thing ? And even then, 2 fleets having to defend to save the Keepstar and maintaining hole control against 2 booshing comp, Goons potentially able to bring 500 chars even if the first timer failed ...
---
Now outside of numbers wars that were all depending on all many *ifs*, can we talk about all the INIT members shit talking about the self destructing caps or how they won against the super skilled HK when WH meta is entirely different from NS and rely a lot more on individuals than large alliances ? As much respect as I have from my former alliance mates, this was really fucking low to see. This could have been handled as a really good logistical play, one good bombing run, and a good loot piñata. But it mostly turned into reddit chest beating for 2 days.

I just [edited my initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/afv6hz/abolish_the_csm_tell_me_im_wrong/ee1n7d7/) on how I think CSM should be elected. It's a different system than the current, but I think you can't poke the same holes in it. 
---
It's a system where CCP handpicks permanent focus groups (they did handpick focus groups before without having to define specific criteria on how) on different playstyles, and lets the focus groups to pick their representatives to form the CSM. Focus groups do smaller unstructured online discussions with interested devs on matters isolated to their own playstyle. While CSM does structured online and face-to-face discussions on matters that involve many playstyles.
---
I'm not sure how you can put "meta" rules in - most of the stuff that was considered meta (like the Judge thing) were stuff that happened outside of the formal summit. How can they police stuff that happens at the bar after hours? 
---
I hear a lot of claims that individual CSM members are only self serving and only focus on things that will benefit their groups, but I haven't seen any evidence of that while I've been serving. 
---
If you think the goal post has moved your reading comprehension is poor.
---
mfw blaster frigate master race gets to finally kill titans
---
I don’t believe that was ever a stated goal by anyone there, otherwise supercap fleets would have been deployed.
---
Content related goals are generally stated reasons for SIG deployments.
---
The funny thing about all Goons justifications and refutes is it sounds really cool as a Goon saying "you have a fair chance, you just gotta n+1 better than us" when you are in the largest alliance in the game. 
---
 Must be nice living in delusion.

That is not my main proposal (although I think it would be a better system). 
---
I was writing you a post about my main proposal that I came to arrive via this topic. I edited my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/afv6hz/abolish_the_csm_tell_me_im_wrong/ee1n7d7/) with it.

Anytime I'm about to do an in-game report, I get the warning message that says my account will have action taken against it if my report is bad...
---
I than shrug my shoulders and decide it's best for me to not report anything, even though I know my report is good - the warning message just makes me say "fuck it" and just give up.
---
Except you don't have to outnumber us for CSM elections; they're in the STV format, which explicitly provides more power to smaller candidates.

I've never understood this perception of me. I'm just a teddy bear.

We have regular moon mining fleets and caretaker ratting fleets. These fleets are usually set up for New beans so that they can ask questions and get answers. 
---
You can also rat solo in a VNI there are plenty of systems. You need to pay attention to local because Geminate is always hostile. Horde likes it this way because it generates content for PVP Beans. Carrier ratting is more dangerous but still doable in Geminate. I think I have made a couple Billion last month doing just that. 
---
There really are no requirements to join or stay in Horde. Everyone is welcome. If you want to get into the more gated parts of Horde like Blessed Beans there are easily meet requirements, but you are not missing out on anything by just staying in Horde Inc.

You haven't read PGL posts have you...

The thing is, that's what I've been doing the entire time I've been on the CSM.  I campaigned on and have been serving based on my belief that the entire server are my constituents, and I owe it to them to do what's in the best interests of the game, regardless of the impact on my own playstyle/group. 
---
This is why I've been holding townhalls, am present on the regular forums, here, a ton of discords, all the talk shows and podcasts, etc. I'm the most accessible CSM guy out there, and I respond to everything everybody sends to me, even in-game emails. 
---
I mean, the 500 MN HIC thing is a perfect example of that - I took the lead on representing getting that fixed for WHers. I was in all the threads, and behind the scenes I was pushing internally to get this fixed. Why would I have done all that if I was only in it for my own group? 
---
Can you point out any times where I have sat in my capacity as a CSMer and come off as only caring about my alliance/playstyle? I really don't think I've ever done that. 
---
Is that the BFG 10000?
---
I haven't played since early 2016. What is an Upwell palatine keepstar?  
---
Can someone please explain or provide a link?
---
All of that pressupposes that CCP is capable of picking 15-20 players in each playstyle who are considered "experts." 
---
All of this requires way too much time of the community team compared to the existing system. I just don't know if all that extra work will provide noticeably better feedback than the existing system. 
---
CCP isn't allowed to name wars. I'm referring to the 2016 war in which the Casinos paid mercenaries to evict the Imperium. It concluded when the Casinos were outlawed, bankers had their wallets zeroed, and ringleaders were banned for RMT. I take it you were one of the mercs on the payroll.
---
The logs show nothing

How can that not be mined? Like seriously, the dscan window populates as text and can easily be moved to the clipboard for parsing. 
---
i honestly think about the positive effects of that exchange on a regular basis

So when we fight you count the total numbers of chars that are in the wormhole (atleast 2/3 of which are logged off and not in the fight). Calling rage rolling just luck is a bit of a stretch as it works fairly reliably (obviously) and why does it matter in your argument anyway? They had the tactical advantage since they knew exactly what we had on the wormhole at the time of their formup and would be able to freely chose their shiptype. We had around 200 and they undocked around 200. After they gained hole control we banged the drums and got an additional 60 ravens (have you ever fought muninns in ravens?) I only mention the horde fleet to show how lopsided things would have been to the other side if they would have succeeded. So lopsided that they most likely would have won the whole thing since that fleet is the only one we knew of and who knows what they would have brought in with hours of hole control. Everyone and their mum knew the actual fight would be about hole control and not the keepstar itself. By the time its in final reff the thing is pretty much over and whatever numbers you see after that dont even matter.
---
i dunno what *"ifs"* is supposed to mean but the fact that hk talked the same shit about smaller wh groups that self destructed when they evicted them is enough reason to just treat them the same way. Also what do you expect with all the guys bored doing hole control... you know how things go if ppl get bored. The meta is different, exactly and thats my point. In their arrogance they claimed nobody from nullsec would be able to deal with their meta but it was the other way around.
---
So when you approach me with this "i used to like you" bullshit do you remember me talking bullshit or trash and spinning fights? I think you are reading too much into the hk downvote brigade here.
---

As a goon I wholly approve this measure, the tritanium market is bloated to shit rn
---
yeah a lot of people on reddit haven't been playing long enough to realize this: goonswarm has no fixed way to play the game.  for a decade mining was despised and mocked because it was bad; now that it is good suddenly our anti-mining principles are pro-mining principles.  we've consistently told ccp something's dumb, and then if we're ignored we abuse the everliving crap out of it until they get the point, because we're confident we can figure out whatever the next system is.

Its not that the toys are getting used

This is pretty much standard in WH space where a single DPS ship, logi, boosh, or sabre can mean the difference between winning and being wiped out. Managing a sabre/dps in a pitched fight is hard and triple boxing like what's shown here is *really* hard. Impressive footage and great editting. 
---
Or instead of taking a black and white view of it you keep the voting system in place but make it so every area of the game is represented in relatively equal numbers. Obviously Null is always going to have a hugely disproportionate number of representatives because they've assisted in making null the most attractive area of space to people of every skill/SP level, and they have no incentive to ever change that because even at the most basic level they only know/care about the health of null. If I wanted to be more bitter you could even say they only care about \*their\* null.  
---
There's a reason that the US has one group decided by population and one decided by an equal representation across states. You cannot do one or the other because they both have massive issues in terms of representing the players/people they are supposed to be representing.  
---
You have 10 CSM members. Even if you took a population influenced route and said Null gets 4, HS gets 2, WHs get 2, LS get 2; and then everyone votes on the candidates for each area. That would still be a \*vast\* improvement over the current situation and takes into account that null is a larger area than the others while still giving the others an actual voice.
---
Wrong. The fact that players can be elected and win a free trip to CCP HQ is a unique charm point. The backroom deals that go on there are an important part of the meta, like [Judgement Day](https://kotaku.com/how-eve-players-pulled-off-the-biggest-betrayal-in-its-1806168400). This stuff gets EVE into the mainstream media.
---
&gt; All of that pressupposes that CCP is capable of picking 15-20 players in each playstyle who are considered "experts."
---
They did it for issues like T3C rebalance. Worked as fine as it can.
---
&gt; All of this requires way too much time of the community team compared to the existing system. 
---
The work to select 20 members into 8-12 focus groups is indeed significant. But it is one time work. Next year, each focus group might have to replace 2-3 people, but CCP will have the existing focus group to get feedback on who else to get in the group. Create a forum topic, get candidates, get the opinions of the existing focus groups on who to add. Perhaps a few of hours of work each year.
---
&gt; I just don't know if all that extra work will provide noticeably better feedback than the existing system.
---
You are too immersed in the existing system to know its shortcomings.
---
wtf i love ducks now
---
Get Beta launcher

Speak of the Devil...

But seriously, you put in the work to run for CSM and try to do something.  Means you've done more for the game than 99.999999% of the rest of us.

Maybe they think the players want it. The voting numbers proves there's more players that don;t vote versus those who vote. Who will tell them if the players want the csm, the csm?

how would you argue that? The biggest thing to happen in wormholes was init/imperium killing the keepstars. Does that not mean active participants? Do we not use wormholes to travel places? We have citadels and certain sigs/squads live in wormholes. How are we not actively participating in that area?  
---
I am, of course, playing Devil's advocate here, but the question remains: how would you define active participants?
---
Pirat's killboard is amazing and disgusting at the same time

I was actually gonna nominate Battleship_Praxis because he's basically amakboma 2.0 but tbh I think you've got this fam

Only members of The Imperium and their pets refer to it as The Casino War. The better half of New Eden call it by its true name, WORLD WAR BEE! Bitch.
---
Member when aryth tried to pull the er's and none of the other csm's had any valid point against that because that's not their niche?
---
So basically the standard Monday business.

PGL Undocks, goes as expected.

They aren't selectively enforcing the eula though, unless you are suggesting they are banning certain bottlers and not others. They are enforcing the eula badly for everyone.

Ok mate

wtf squats on toes is not true squat heels on ground you loli piece of shit
---
The point I'm making about gates is you can't tell what I did at that gate. Merely that I was there. I could jump out. I could cloak. I could warp off. I could jump to a cyno or be bridged. 
---
I suppose bots both sides of gates would help confirm that a jump took place. But even then suppose I don't jump and cyno out or w/e you are still forced to stop ratting because you assume I am there.
---
Eventually greed will outweigh the strength of their safety net.
---
Point is you still can't avoid wormholes or long stay campers unless you are willing to stop ratting forever because there might have been someone there last Tuesday.
---
You know me so well, Sam!

---
&gt; You'd be very surprised at the level of filtering that needs to &gt;happen in order to cut through the noise and get to the signal. The CSM helps immensely with this. They don't just come to us - we go to them for feedback too as a sounding board.
---
That sounds like a very late burn for when you guys removed the advanced sound settings. 
---
You helped an enemy of democracy escape. She was stealing an apple of the people.

I think once it's 6km long it's at least called a sword.

CCP wield the banhammer in one of two ways : they forget about its existence or they Hiroshima the fuck out of an entire group all at once : See IWI, Drone Region Russians etc.

Sorry I assume the goal was to secure the keepstar, not killboard

Abyssal PvP is basically backwards from what eve should have. Rather than requiring people who are interested in PvP to pve in an instance in order to get a "fair" fight but with a lot of limitations (solo, cruisers, fit, etc etc)... Eve needs pve (or pve-ish-style payouts/regards) that is more-or-less gated behind PvP.
---
Theoretically all pve is this. Except the game world is way too bit for the number of players in it, and other mechanics and player mindsets contribute to stifling most forms of PvP, so it doesn't really work that way. Most pve is just pve, with the possibility of PvP happening as an interruption only a thought in the back of a player's head.
---
We need lucrative pve that's more like escalations or fw or whatever sites, in that it's protected from cap drops but not so restrictive as abyssal, that is telegraphed to anyone who might want to come fight those who would try to do it. Make the pve rewards be earned through winning the PvP fights at the site moreso than grinding the pve content down in an empty or safe system.
---
WHs are kinda this, but not lucrative enough to be worth the effort and risk compared to grinding null. Fw has potential, and lots of folks more experienced with me have a lot of ideas for it. Etc.
---
But nah. CCP puts in gimmick, arena, limited-scope PvP gated behind instanced, limited scope pve. Cause that's what eve's all about, right?
---
This content wasn't dead on arrival. It was dead BEFORE arrival. Anyone who's ever undocked a solo cruiser, upon hearing this announcement, had their mind flooded with at least half a dozen "but what's stopping them from just \_\_\_\_\_\_" questions regarding how these instances could possibly work in a way that was fun
---
I actually didn't know they don't spawn if there's not enough players. That's both hilarious and pathetic. What a great way to discourage players from even attempting the content.
---
Eventually CCP will hire someone who has played an MMO before, who will quickly point out that you can't have high profile instanced content that sticks without some mechanism to balance the game. Especially a game with as many hilariously fucked up mechanics as EVE. EVE makes WoW 1.0 look like checkers in terms of balance.
---
Since Abyssals were released, there have been what... one? two balance patches that touched an Abyssal-eligible ship? I think Zealots got a drone bay. Wowee wow. Game changer.
---
Nothing to address how limited turret ships are. Nothing to address gilas farming the content out and raising filament prices to exactly the value of the sites minus 1. No attempt or even a signal that they are even thinking about how to address how 2 or 3 hulls completely define the abyssal PVP meta
---
But hey the posters are nice so whatever

---
CCPlease - deployable asteroid - so rorquals can PANIC when not in belts / anoms
---
The thing you're basically missing is that while elections can be suboptimal for getting the most knowledgeable people, it's precisely the "null voting blocks" that counteract this.  We know we can get one or two candidates on, so we're going to pick the _best_ people to get on, out of pure self-interest: a good eve means we're having fun and can continue to have fun.  So we're gonna put in the people who get that done.  Now, candidate #3 from GSF may, occasionally, be somewhat of a joke candidate - but numbers 1 and 2 never are.  And without tooting our own horn too much, it's usually quite obvious from the minutes that our candidates are doing an excellent job.
---
The idea that CCP can't tell if one of our reps is blatantly proposing stuff in our own self interest is dumb - and doing something that dumb means our reps won't get listened to.  I want Aryth being listened to not because CCP listening to him will advantage us, because my arrogance is enough to blot out the sun, i don't need a hidden edge like that.  I want him listened to because dumb decisions make a less fun game which means we have a smaller captive audience of potential victims.  If Aryth goes "what this game needs is all bounties in Delve doubled, and halved everywhere else" he'll just get tuned out when he's pointing out a key flaw in another idea.  And we're not going to put up a candidate who doesn't know that: we put up people we think are intelligent, can add to the conversation, and will be listened to.  And we have the ability to put in people who are going to shake things up and push back on bad ideas because they're not appointed by CCP - obviously just being a pointless pain in the ass gets them tuned out, but being a useful pain in the ass doesn't get them replaced by someone who won't poke holes in things in the current system. 
---
The reality is that we keep winding up on top because we've got organization, a decade of organizational knowledge, numbers, and an utter lack of shame in changing our playstyle to wind up on top of the current meta.  We're going to minmax the CSM voting system because that's what we do and it was hilarious to get as much of it as we did this year.
---
If you kick someones sandcastle over and they go 'Yeh whatever' you need to find another way to piss then off. 
---
Yeah, if your fit can spare the power grid, a large cap battery really frees up your slots now.

Man I though kill board boasting was pathetic, we're literally mining boasting. Fuck me how far we've fallen. 
---
"Worked as fine as it can" - Capri pointed out the criticism of that panel in particular, especially the outcome. 
---
I still think the amount of work is way too much, and groups of that size are completely unwieldy. 
---
I would also argue that folks who haven't worked within the confines of the existing system aren't really able to know the real shortcomings, because they don't see what actually happens, just the perception. 
---
Yeh that totally reasonable comment from the dude totally makes me thi k he's triggered. Fuck me I wish we'd stop letting in absolute fucking mouth breathers. 
---
Then PanFam went on an eviction war path and test had a choice between Goons or death. 
---
Nice cartoon 
---

---
I'd form a longer response to this, but when even the base math seems to be off it's hard to really reason with you.
---
Geographically, nullsec is far larger yes. In terms of population, there's far more players who operate and live out of "Empire" space than null, so even your base assumption that nullsec is a larger in terms of population is incorrect, if that's what you were saying in your post (that's how I understood it, sorry if I misinterprited).
---
There's a higher CSM voter turnout in nullsec for sure - but that's based on exactly what some people complain about - the ability to organize and actually get together a group who'll rally together and vote.
---
The issue is less about who's running, and restricting the number of people who can run, and more about increasing awareness and voter turnout overall.
---
There's actually been a few interesting suggestions in this thread - including in client voting and better advertising for awareness, which are things I'd LOVE to see, but as it stands, priorities for development are elsewhere for now with due reason.
---
I remember him bringing it up, and I remember CCP ignoring it and still putting the ERs out. 
---
I am genuinely proud of every in game medal I have but its a very underutilised system. CCP should make it easier to mass hand them out. 
---
i dunno who "we" is, but we fought back for months, just not on the terms that our enemies wanted us to
---
it ultimately didn't work, but the hard knocks approach would have been "welp lets move to jita" the second someone showed up in dek
---
This already exists, it's called an "infrastructure hub." Take that out, and you eliminate anomaly respawns, both ore and rat.
---
Yes, everyone should just have lived in peace and not attackes eachother
---
He genuinely is though. 
---
All of the conversations I've had with the Devs make it clear to me that whether the players want it or not, they do. The reason they want it isn't because they think it's popular with the players. 
---
Good frag. These guys are known to have zero notion of PVP when it comes to something else than fragging noobs on the undock.
---
Still, you were very lucky to actually encounter one of them that's a tiny bit less risk adverse than the rest of wardeccers and tried to kill you. 
---
It's sad because he very well might get kicked from PIRAT, because instead of teaching their members, they order them to blob together and never lose anything.
---
It could just also be Aryth having a degree of paranoia.  I know I do, and would probably do similar to what he did were I in his position.  I would not want to get my account banned because of a witch hunt or metagaming.

---
Hi! I miss you.
---
Literally everyone who isn't init cares about the narrative in this fight. That's how every outside entity views the fight. Also - Every time we go on a campaign mittens posts about us controlling the narrative, it's a big deal in EVE. I don't understand how you don't see that. 
---
This is the answer. The content miners create for themselves is minimal compared to the content they create for others by being targets or something to save.
---
I hope not either! But just in case, here's the screenshot that /u/hoseherdown posted and then deleted - https://i.imgur.com/wk8AgdZ.png

drone travel time is much worse than 30% in the typical case, excavators are slow as balls
---
Skillu are ducks?
---
Spoken like a rebellious underdog. The Imperium and their allies are the dominant force in New Eden. See you on the battlefield.
---
We rolled over and died early as fuck in the Dek campaign. Sure we took fleets out and stuff but the writing was on the wall super early for anyone who knows how eve works. As soon as we evacced to Saranen we'd lost Dek as a whole. 
---
That's now how we operate. 
---
Eh, generalizing too much about PIRAT is a bad idea. Some of them are quite good at small gang hunting and fighting, others are *very* good at demolition work and abusing highsec mechanics to avoid risk and so on (corp-hopping mid-fights etc). They get results. 
---
Of course, a lot of them are quite wank the moment they can't tilt everything in their favor, but that's true of many.
---
Give me a couple hours to get home from work I'll link you some firesides where mittens talks about the importance of narrative in eve. Maybe you missed his lessons. 
---
haha, there wasn't any pun intended or any specific example inferred there.
---
It's kind of ironic really, before I came to CCP I was a critic of the CSM. I thought it was a PR stunt and a pointless effort. I was in the camp that viewed it as a waste of time and money.
---
Sitting in on my first summit and seeing how the company interacts with the council changed that overnight. It's a small price to pay.
---
True, it's not perfect - no system ever is when it comes to guaging feedback, delivering sentiment and collaborating on making the right choices, especially when it comes to EVE, but it works pretty well to be fair, all things considered.
---
The main positive that I take out of this thread is that whether a player loves the CSM or hates it, they're passionate about it and want to share opinion. Yes, there's a lot of negativity in this thread around the CSM, but buried among it, people are still trying to suggest change that would be for the better, rather than going with the OP's suggestion of "kill it with fire."
---
That, for me, says a lot about the vailidity of the institution itself and the fact that overall it's considered a positive thing to have an elected council to represent the community.
---
I'm pretty sure the CSM will continue to morph and evolve over the years - it has done in the past, increasing and decreasing in size, getting involved in various projects - when it boils down to it, it's a sentiment tool that delivers feedback and validates decision, similar to a feedback thread or a survey, but one where we can get a far more in depth and experienced viewpoint to the development team from people who live and breath the changes that we make.
---
You can't really put a price on that.
---
Entosing for a full hour to get a 48 hour timer until it has any effect, and when it does you just get 5 ecm ceptors thrown at you with no counterplay.
---
Hmm.
---
Where do you think half of this came from... Literally apply the concept to Lowsec on a more intimate scale.

Weird. A Goon saying no to a discussion about improving lowsec. 🙄

It sounds like you've never used Python do SPI, I2C, or even direct USB device access.
---
Python is indeed a high-level language, but it has a lot of libraries for hardware access.  This is what makes it attractive to some developers (one of our products uses it - a product we inherited when we bought the company - hence the version requirement).
---
Many Linux system utilties are similarly written in Python, because of the low-level libraries.
---
If you need to do text processing, CGI, XML, SQL, etc., there are other better languages.  It is really bad for server-side web-apps, for example.  Python has real problems with multiple threads, and memory usage (there is even a dev blog on how wasteful it is).

Horde's main focus always has and always will be gudfites, so I'm not complaining the goons/TAPI seem to be totally okay with getting HAC fleets and dreads dunked on the reg in exchange for basically 24/7 blops coverage of Geminate and a few Athanor kills in TKE

---
I'm a lowseccer myself, and your idea is bad.
---
This isn't complex at all, and the timers are more or less irrelevant  here. If you're roaming around 1-10 people you're just going to system hop and take the tags until someone chases you. If you're 20-30 people you'll reinforce it to hopefully spur a response fleet. If you're in a larger fleet than that then you can probably tackle some other large objective.
---
I should have refined my population point there because you're very right that HS has more players, but I mean active and organized players. And yea it's easy to say that null just "built an empire" and therefore has the organization to do that. But of course they do because you've made it impossible for any other area of space to support a group that big. You want to try and stick a 34,000 man alliance into a wormhole and see how that goes for them? Hell stick them in an equal number of Wormholes as they have systems and see how well that supports them and how far their "organization" goes.  
---
When an area of space has unlimited resources and a constantly respawning group of income generating sites *of course* they are going to build an empire. If you put 40 instantly respawning sites in WH's you'd see the exact same thing because now WHs could support huge groups of players with a very small amount of actual systems.  
---
You can't talk about this like "all else is equal null sec just organized better" because other areas of space don't have anywhere near the same handicaps at generating a group that large, that's why you only see it in null.  
---
All of wormhole space doesn't even equal a single of the large null-sec entities, how is awareness ever going to affect that? WHs are not as new player friendly, not at all supportive of large groups, and all the organization in the world isn't going to offset basic things like the lack of alliance bookmarks and how much more there is to lose if shit goes wrong. Look at Asset Safety, the protection that Cyno's offer (in part due to the fact that null groups don't need to spread out much at all), the lack of risk in spamming stuctures, and even just the passive income that null generates due to being able to tax everything with 0 input/logistics from leadership while WHs have to actively come up with systems that require maintenance to even remotely do the same thing.
---
Now, witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational Light Electron Blaster ii !
---
I understand what you're saying, I'm just explaining that INIT has never been a group that has cared particularly about narrative. That's just our alliance culture. 
---
You're assuming that everybody who wants to get rid of local only wants that to kill krabs and bots.
---
I still think moving “comet clusters” or something similar which is the only source of ice needed for fuels would be a solid attempt.
---
Really this is your great achievement. 
---
You got CCP to release a module that is harder to build, that is statistically worse and does the roll just barely and we should take this as a massive victory ? 
---
You do get the only reason people where not pissed about it is because the originally presented plan was worse. 
---
You also seem to leave out the part where you where the one pushing for the 500 MN HIC mass thing in the first place.
---
If this is your success what does a freaking failure you look like? 
---
Jus take fleet to losec
---
Every single one of the groups mentioned above does an amazing job forming for fleets and going on roams. Ive never had a better group of bros :*)
---
I expected her to be half duck. Am disappointed. 
---
*Not my idea
---
*This is to be a discussion. Discuss.
---
Only a goon poster would fail to read this as sarcasm
---
This is actually really good. It would introduce a lot more skirmishing and with the chances of escalation also with constant pressure the damage could be really good.
---
Querns and CCP Falcon having a conversation on an internet forum...CLEARLY THERES A CCP BIAS TOWARDS ~~band of brothers~~ GoonFleet!
---
No, it's an example of me working for a community I'm not apart of. Fixing the 500 MN HIC bug was originally not my idea. It had been on a list of stuff that folks had been asking for over the years. 
---
When it was put on the list of changes, I pointed out that WHers needed a fix because they relied on that ship working the way it did, and they shouldn't be screwed. 
---
After it was announced, I went back and kept pushing to get it fixed so that WHers wouldn't be completely screwed by the change. That was successful.
---
I'm sorry that you don't like the module or that it doesn't work as well as the old system, but even you acknowledge that having it is better than nothing. 
---
Sometimes that's the best you can get.  
---
Failure looks like somebody who never shows up, never talks to anybody, never does anything. Say what you want about me, but I've shown up, talked to everybody, and done as much as I could to help the game. 
---
&gt;Python only excels in it's low-level libraries. If you don't need to tweak hardware, there are many other better alternatives.
---
This is what you said which is literally the opposite of what you're now claiming. It's a high-level language that is painful to use if you're trying do low-level hardware access, exactly as intended.
---
&gt;If you need to do text processing, CGI, XML, SQL, etc., there are other better languages. 
---
Like?
---
&gt;It is really bad for server-side web-apps, for example. Python has real problems with multiple threads, and memory usage (there is even a dev blog on how wasteful it is).
---
It's an incredibly common server side web language and the only reason PHP beats it is history. WSGI solves many issues with the GIL to the point where thread locking is a meme and a non-issue. Instagram runs on Django to this side; do you think they have issues with concurrency? ;)
---
closet?
---
Oh boy, prepare for a wall of text. 
---
So, let's get one thing out of the way, most wormholers, myself included, and every HK member I've spoken too, minus like, two, are not bitter. Or angry. It was an operation and you won. Did we stand a chance? Hell no. But it was a victory, fair and square within the rules of eve. Those rules being: win at any cost possible. So no, this can't be deflected as me being mad.
---
I'd break down my grievances with yourself and the judge into three categories. Experience, usefulness, and conduct.
---
Experience wise, you're a line member and he's a diplomat. Between the two, being a line member is actually more useful, but neither is useful, really. You're not an fc who can talk about the challenges of running fleets or herding cats, or an alliance leader who can talk about the nuances of sov, recruiting and corp mechanics. As a diplo, the judge can talk about... how to get people not to kill rorquals. Neither of you can bring any unique or indepth game knowledge. Having the average players perspective is useful, but that's the sort of shit you can get from a 2 minute conversation with a line member from 6 different alliances. They'll say the same thing. 
---
Usefulness. So full disclosure here, we don't get the full csm minutes. So I'll never know what you ACTUALLY say in these meetings. But so far I've seen nothing to prove you actually add anything to these conversations except another echo chamber for goon bloc. You talk about representing smaller entities, indeed like wormholes, yep you name drop people like 'exookiz and kelishnikov', exookiz is fair, except he claims to have spoken to you once, and kelish is just a random hk line member, so that's the wh equivalent of saying I spoke to a goon line member and he represents all of goons. 
---
Now for conduct... I mean, look, reddit is reddit, so all I'm going to mention is you've shown a total disregard for anyone who disagrees with you, but with reddit being reddit, I can't entirely blame you for that. But you've also said things such as your quote from when we were all upset becuase of 500mn hic changes, where you claimed talking about wormholes were a 'waste of your time' because ccp never intended people to live in them. Your conduct overall has set a tone of just how little you care about anything but giant ass goon bloc. 
---
No personal disrespect meant, I've never actually interacted with you, but I disagree that you contribute to the csm.
---
Uh, smart guy, the entire coalition was in Saranen long before even bits of vale started falling. Well, they were supposed to be. FA didn't listen, and look how that went for them.
---
giving each type of space (HS, LS, NS &amp; WH) atleast 1 mandatory seat as a base would be a nice imo. whoever got the most votes for his type of space gets the mandatory seat.
---
fill up the rest by votes independed from type of space.
---
This makes sure each type of space is represented atleast once.
---
I'm not sure what you expect from the CSM. They are not there to help you, me, their alliance or some other players. They are there to help CCP - basically cheap advisors, who (hopefully) know the ingame world better than the creative minds and programmers in the company.
---
The CSM is not a parliament, they have no power, and if CCP isn't interested in their opinion to a certain topic, chances are they aren't listening to them at all.
---
I wouldn't even say that's a terrible thing. Imho game publishers should listen to their community, but never take commands. "The community" is not representative in two ways: First, a lot of casual players don't participate a lot in discussions about the game or in the CSM election (and even if they do, they don't really know the candidates anyway). But these casuals generate a large part of the revenue, and it would be extremely bad for the game, if they pissed them off in order to please a loud core community. Second, the "community" usually sounds overly negative to the status quo. Yeah, you rarely go on forums/reddit to tell people how great a 7 years old detail of the game mechanics is. But those who don't like it will post about that again and again - even if they're actually a small minority.
---
So because you as a group are one of the few who 'don't care about the nsrrwtive' it doesn't matter? Also. You say you don't care about the narrative but given the strong pushing of the Kotaku story and dismissal of the actual events (Kotaku paints it as a far less one sided affair than it was) I'd say you care at least a little. 
---
I said it didn't matter in the context of it not mattering to us. 
---
I've been linking the kotaku article because linking it is funny to me.  
---
I kind of want to link the CENTI/LUMPY hentai now...
---
Yes, and that's when we'd lost our space. It was over at that point. Anyone who didn't see that was delusional.

How many emphatic victories had we had up till that point? 
---
Sure but he has been banned for it before.
---
No you wouldn't. People still rat in drone boats (gila/snake) in wormhole sites all the time. Making anomalies target drones like sleepers do would absolutely not make drones untenable.
---
In fact at the moment you're basically an idiot if you don't rat with a drone boat. This is a strong indication that drone boats need a heavy nerf in PVE.

Please learn your history and stop huffing memes. It's helping no one.
---
Experience wise, I've been playing the game for 13 years. I've spent time doing most everything most players have done at one time or another. I've gone from high sec to low sec, and I've done industry, done mining, done ratting, done mission running, small gang to massive super cap fights, etc.  I have the perspective of the average player of the game - should there not be a place on the CSM for that perspective?  We are, after all, the bulk of the game.  Why not have somebody who has that view on the CSM? 
---
There aren't that many folks still playing that have been around as long as I have. That should count for something, that I'm still here, still playing. 
---
As far as usefulness goes, ask the other CSM members what they think about me. In terms of who I talk to, I literally talk to anybody who wants to talk to me and I can't and don't remember the names of everybody. I'm in all of these discords to talk to people. I take ideas and questions from anybody who asks and I pass on everything I say I will. Who should I be talking to in WHers, for example?  Give me a list of names and I'll be happy to talk to them. 
---
I don't disregard anybody who disagrees with me, and 95% of reddit is just bullshitting and giving folks a hard time. When it comes to doing my job, I talk to everybody and represent everybody. Has anybody ever seen me tell anybody to go fuck themselves? Called somebody a retard? No. I keep going back to the same places where people call me names to get their feedback on stuff, even when they don't want to give it. Who else has done that? 
---
I have never claimed that talking about wormholes was a waste of my time. I wouldn't have spent as much time talking to you guys if I thought it was a waste of time. Others on the CSM have flat out said "fuck all wormholes" - both Aryrh and Killahbee - and you guys don't say a thing criticizing either of them. I end up being your punching bag because I'm the one actually talking to you. I mean, how would you even know who I am if I wasn't talking to you guys? Why would I spend as much time on the forums, in the discords, on reddit, if I only cared about my own people?
---
Anytime you want to talk to me, let me know. Shoot me an email at briscrubal@csm.eve.com or find me on any of the two dozens discords I'm in. 
---
Well it started years ago, though it feels like yesterday. 
---
I was just a wayward soul, having newly joined Dirt N' Glitter, recruited by him, and I went inactive shortly thereafter.
---
This is because I had moved to a new anarchist commune and was too busy to keep up with my new, debauchery filled schedule; Alas, there was something familiar about the raw, burning sexual energies in the eyes of one of the dominant gimps, but I couldnt make the connection until much later.
---
A year later, having gotten used to my new life as a communal toilet, I decided to hop back on the Eve horse where I bebopped around for a while, solo.
---
I got dunked on by a vaguely familiar name, to see that it was the recruiter of the last corp I joined! I messaged him shortly thereafter, and was quickly inducted.
---
We shared many a late, incredibly drunk, shenanigan filled night for a long time. Gatecamps, frig roams, hotdrops, arguing about fits, all of it.
---
The fateful night we met in person, was a truly special one, though I suppose we had truly met about two years beforehand.
---
I was undertaking my daily punishment of holding 10 pounds of  custard in my large intestine, complaining to the gimp that I couldnt hold it any longer, when he finally graced me with his angelic voice.
---
Husky and dark, like smoked glass, he whispered into my ear "Whoah there bucko, slow your roll."
---
My eyes watered as I stared deep into his, and I whispered back "Hi I'm Dentass".
---
Now the real question is can it sync up with my ship in game
---
brisk rural wants to know your location.... 
---
I think that was for botting. (wich obviously is even worse)
---
And if he is a repeated offender im all for banning him. I just don't think daily or weekly postings will change the outcome.
---
Hugely similar to issues in politics. Lot's of talk but very little effectual change on the actual issue affecting people in reality.
---
CCP. The guys i said decide on what's cheating...
---
Sure thing, please do.
---
We've got enough alts that we can just park a carrier or two by the ESS while the rest of the system mines. And since it's cyno jammed, there's no real worry about dreads dropping on them. We'll just be sure to anchor the ESS in line with one of the fortizars in our station, so we can easily undock and warp the 10,000km or whatever tiny grid there is.
---
The "little guys" you talked in your post might not be able to afford to leave several carriers just afk off an ESS, but like you said, this won't affect them all that much.
---
Wait are you actually in Skill urself now?

Generally, from my own perspective and getting a better understanding of structure bashing and even doing some of my own. I think damage caps are terrible. I understand why they're there, but at the same time, they're very clunky.
---
As it would have 2 RF timers, i would say no, it would not have a damage cap. The 1st timer is more just from a small gang perspective of "hey fuck you for not undocking, deal with 50% bounties for a while". The 2nd RF timer is more of a "you're about to lose your shit if you don't defend it". So a fight will happen if they care about the system.
---
Yep.

Sansar might be cool once they finish it.  I’d walk around jita in VR 
---
I actually agree with you. My freighter runs are much, much more dangerous than my JF runs. I'd be for upping the danger level of JF piloting. Just not like this.
---
In the meantime, maybe we could make mechanics of hisec freighting be unsafe but also not totally broken in favor of gankers, but that's another story for another thread.

1) You more-or-less described an iHub
---
2) If you're going to make it a cyno jammer, I'd make the bubble one-way.  Have it not affect warps to its grid, but block warps away from the structure.  You take away a lot of possible cap response/escalation to response if ships always land at 0.

FC: hey guys fleet up we gotta bash this citadel in BWF.  ignoring the fact its the 17th one we've killed, they've never showed up to fight for it, and they keep replacing it cause its less effort to replace than it is to friggin kill.   but it will be fun watching you all waste your ammo on reflected dmg, and all of you who got dreads expecting them to speed this shit up watch dust gather on said dreads.

Well, the fortizar was there before snuff was to be fair.

Rorqs - Nerf or remove panic, reduce the size of asteroids so you can't multibox-afk them for so long, reduce ore anomaly respawn rate so you can't run as many rorqs per system.
---
Cap/supercap umbrella problems - Make it harder to drop them everywhere on demand by nerfing cynos. I'm a fan of a spool up timer, giving the people you are potentially dropping a chance to do something about it first. Also, make inhibitors actually inhibit cynos (so you can't jump to one if an inhib goes up - the cyno should probably automatically get taken down), more survivable and easier to pick up again.

&gt; As a large group will have multiple systems/regions to defend, they can't realistically cover every single system with immediate response. 
---
"Realistically" 
---
I have no doubts you could do that with a couple systems. Not every one though. Also, i'd be happy to see you leave some capitals in a cyno jammed bubble. Plenty of comps to deal with 1-2 isolated carriers and a sabre can just bubble in line to your fort to prevent you from landing FAX/reinforcements. EZ kills and we'll take your tags while you watch with your impotent FAX.
---
This strawman comes up everytime, with your "innumerable alts". You'd be spread so thin over a region, you'd have a couple guys per system at most. 
---
But then you'd be having pixel sex with people that are 99.9% men where SL is 97.5% men.
---
First, I would be remiss if I didn't defend the honor of my team: CSM8 had no leakers. We had a remarkably good, dedicated group of people. 13 out of 14 members of CSM8 honestly cared both about the game and about our role as player advocates (the 14th didn't have time for the role and should never have run). But I can't speak to that concern for any CSM but the one I was on, and I agree with you that some CSMs have been less than ideal.
---
Now with that said, blaming the CSM for things that are not their fault isn't helpful. There's a bunch of stuff below the line in this post that you might care to read, you might not. But the gist is that the CSM is not a bunch of game developers, not a focus group, but a sounding board for CCP ideas, and very very very occasionally, an advocate for player ideas that may or may not get a fair hearing. That's it and that's all. The CSM is not developing the game and has no direct influence on game development; any CSM member who tells you differently is lying and any CSM candidate who thinks differently is in for a rude awakening when and if they ever reach Reykjavik.
---
That speaks to your question: then what are the CSM good for? Short answer: either preventing the game from being even worse by stopping speculative ideas before they gain a lot of steam (really!), and for giving CCP devs a more direct conduit to player attitudes about the game. These two points alone usually make the CSM worth its very small cost to CCP. Better short answer, though: the CSM has a good deal of soft power that can be used to nudge individual devs down paths that will make the game slightly better in key areas that the players care about... **if** the CSM engages the player base to their benefit.
---
Usually, this doesn't happen, which is why many recent CSMs appear to have little or no value *to the player base*. But the CCP-facing functions remain and I assume are still of value to CCP, else CCP would discontinue the CSM. God knows CCP would get little to no push back from the player base if they chose this option.
---
----
---
Now then: at its heart and something like 85% of the time, the CSM is nothing but a sounding board for devs to bounce their ideas off. At times, the CSM is described as a "focus group" but this is inaccurate, both because focus groups are carefully constructed to represent your customer base (the CSM isn't) and because focus groups are carefully polled and the results of these polls used to shape the output they're reviewing (the CSM isn't). Something like 85% of the time (at least during my tenure) the CSM are shown an upcoming feature that is going to be implemented no matter what the members of the CSM say and we have little to no influence on the shape of that feature. When the CSM is shown something big, this is how it goes. We're shown it, we either like it or we don't, and it goes into the game no matter what we say.
---
A good example of this from CSM8: the new Neocom with the monochrome icons. To a person, we despised it, me most of all. Absolutely nobody on CSM8 liked it with the possible exception of Mike Azariah. We made sure we got our dislike of it into the Summit Minutes and that was all we could do. It made it into the game and sure enough, most players either hate it or actively dislike it. Most of the "big features" of my year on the CSM followed this path, with us either liking it or disliking it, but not having any influence on it.
---
About another 10% of the time, the CSM are shown something speculative which only rarely makes it into the game. I got the impression (with no backing of evidence, I am quick to say) that these features were shown to us in the hopes that the CSM would be really enthusiastic about it and help the devs in question champion it with CCP management. A good example of this one that I can talk about without breaking NDA is the so-called EVE "hardcore mode", the mode that CCP Rise talked about at CCP Vegas a couple of years ago where if you ever get podded, you are perma-killed and have to start over. This was shown to CSM8 in one of our confidential Summit sessions and we reacted to it with a big "meh!" followed by "you really want to spend your resources on *this*?" And to date, perma-death has never gotten off the ground. Had we or the other CSM it was shown to reacted differently, who knows?
---
Finally, about 5% of the time, the CSM is truly able to influence CCP, but in my experience this only happens when there is really strong player backing behind a CSM proposal (or vice versa). The example I love to bring up in these cases are the old "Little Things" efforts. The CSM would canvas the players for little things that CCP could add to the game, get the players to vote on the ones that were most important to them, and then the CSM would present this data to CCP. Virtually *every single idea* that rated highly with the players on the Little Things lists are now either in the game, or at least CCP has given a public reason why they can't be easily added. But the last Little Things effort was five years ago.
---
But this 5% also includes times when individual CSM members, or a small group of CSM members, can use soft power to influence a dev to bring to life something a large block of the players want. I've got my own story like this which I will be able to tell in May and I'm sure other CSM members do also.
---
Anveri was a mistake.
---
&gt;Fixing the 500 MN HIC bug was originally not my idea.
---
The minutes credit Suitonia and Rise. ( not you for the Mass removal ).
---
Your right i toughed the credit you ( my mistake did that from memory ), I guess the if you talk about something a lot you tend to be attached to the idea working against me here. 
---
&gt; When it was put on the list of changes, I pointed out that WHers needed a fix because they relied on that ship working the way it did, and they shouldn't be screwed.
---
The minutes disagree with you here
---
&gt;CCP Rise is thinking more along the lines of just removing the penalties, but finding some way to not impact the Wormholers.
---
Credit for thinking about the wormhole issue went to Rise not you. ( if you disagree take it up with CCP to fix the minutes ). 
---
&gt; I'm sorry that you don't like the module or that it doesn't work as well as the old system, but even you acknowledge that having it is better than nothing.
---
Yes between you can no longer do this and you have jump truth a bunch of hoops the later is better, that still doesn't make the end result good. 
---
&gt; Failure looks like somebody who never shows up, never talks to anybody, never does anything.
---
Well the CSM minutes say you made zero comments on the Issue, so on the official record that's you.
---
&gt; but I've shown up, talked to everybody, and done as much as I could to help the game.
---
Yes you have show up and talked to people, your approachable i will absolutely give you that, the problem is i don't known if you notice this but your public personality isn't exactly on of reasonable consideration and granted you get the brunt of the shit because you put yourself out in the spotlight (where as other csms just ignore the community outside of there alliance completely). 
---
So as much as the might have the same problems they tend not the catch the same shit because well there is no point, in complaining about the a CSM that is unlikely to even read it. 
---
No, the CSM is a good idea. It would be better if there were some kind of 'constituencies' because it can't be healthy for balance to have almost the entire CSM made up of nullbloc players (even if you don't think there will be deliberate attempts to push game design towards Goons' interests, which given their record of metagaming in various games over the years isn't out of the question). Not having a wormholer or a low-sec specialist on there - or even someone representing the high-sec casual, much as they're denigrated on here - is not a good thing.
---
I am sorry but I forgot highsec mechanics. If he shoots you in high sec because of wardec, you should be able to shoot him too, no?
---
Or did you have super low security status and was marked as suspect/criminal in high sec?
---
love it!  though still prefer the classic Lumpy one.  also the slight eye shadow under her eyes is appropriate for eve players who don't realize 7 hours have gone by in this fight.
---
A good chunk of PVPers in lowsec are "pirates", i.e. neutral players who engage pretty much anyone else.  It's not too difficult for people to find fights in the FW plexes (gates/beacons), and as he said, if you stay neutral you have twice as many targets to shoot, haha.
---
Plus, people demand grand, sweeping changes, politicians promise grand, sweeping changes, and the only changes that are possible or really desirable are usually small, consistent, incremental ones.  Then once you work your way into a hole it only gets harder.
---
Brand new account with only that post and posts it to their own profile? 
---
Something about this reminds me of a jita scam. It's not set up right, but I can't quite point out what's bad, but I'm staying the fuck away from it anyway.
---
Think how good content driver it could be in higsec.
---
Motherfucker it's almost spring time
---
Clicked.
---
Immediately regretted.
---
&gt; Goons max/min what is given to them.
---
Everyone who's good at eve does this. It's a competitive game. You play to the max or you lose. 
---
What CCP needs to do is stop giving us mechanics that feel like we're rewarded for punching ourselves in the balls repeatedly. We'll do it to win, but we won't enjoy the game as much. 
---
Some of these concerns could be solved by you, or someone else at CCP seeing something cool or interesting, or notice someone particularly competent explaining a problem in a ticket, a dev would reach out and say, "hey, this is interesting. Can you elaborate or explain? Then having a conversation about possible solutions on a case by case basis."  I do understand scaling that out would be horrific through ISD or GMs, or even through data analysis but imo, doing that on top of democratic elections might help with some of the harsher critics like myself. 
---
There is definitely middle ground here, but it seems the only way to get attention is either being ridiculously loud or being a streamer and also being loud. Being loud sucks, and makes you come off as an asshole, then those people get worked up because they're already upset and possibly explain problems inaccurately or incorrectly. I just think CCP needs to be more publically proactive on top of listening to the concerns of the sov blocs through CSM, sort of like what you're doing here. You're by far, the most reachable and your passion shows, so thanks for what you do. 
---
Even with the streaming thing, I was asked to host a Q and A a long time ago with ISD in my channel before like #streamfleet was a thing or there was any organized effort for streamers.  I gave the times, worked with someone, hyped it up out of excitement, then the dude never showed up or confirmed the dates. I sincerely hope the communication is better or becomes better in future years, as that was embarassing and gave me a very bad taste in my mouth regarding how CCP communicates both internally and externally. 
---
Anyway, thanks for hearing out the concerns even though you seem a little closed minded about other solutions. I hope we see better options for feedback in the future, that dont rely on sov based gatekeepers. 
---
1. In a way, i suppose. An Ihub is for anomaly respawn rate and can be rigged. It also effects mining, whereas the ESS effects actual rat bounties. This could be from anoms or belts. I'd say this would be cheaper and more vulnerable than an Ihub. Its a content driver, not something that allows you hold Sov.
---
2. Current ESS is warp to 0. As you own the space, you can setup your own pings around it if you don't want to warp to 0 on the ESS.

---
&gt; In a way, i suppose. An Ihub is for anomaly respawn rate and can be rigged
---
No, an iHub controls if the anomalies spawn at all.  They have nothing to do with rate.  As a result, loss of a fully-upgraded ratting iHub is far more devastating than 25% bounties.  There are literally no rock havens or sanctums anymore.  And there will not be until you work up the ADM from belt rats and a couple anomalies.
---
&gt; Current ESS is warp to 0.
---
If it's an actual bubble, it will drag anyone warping near to to 0.  I'm suggesting instead of that have the ESS effectively point anything that gets close to it.
---
Or maybe just not formed a mega coalition to go on a seal kicking expedition.

Neither is worse than the other in the end because they are effectively the same thing. But if you were heard and ignored you know for sure then that the devs don't care. you don't have to live in a limbo state of not knowing if the devs care or not.

The minutes aren't a transcript of the conversations. I know that I talked to Rise about the HIC thing, and we all had a discussion about the changes - the minutes indicate "ideas were thrown around" and I was involved there.  Again, ask the rest of the CSM who has been the most vocal about WHers on the CSM and see what they tell you.
---
The guys who aren't present and who aren't approachable aren't approachable for exactly this reason - they don't have the tolerance for being shit on that I do, by virtue of what I do in real life. So this ends up being a self-fulfilling thing. Folks complain that CSMers aren't in the community, but the ones who are get shit on so hard that the others don't even bother. It's kind of dumb.

I'd prefer that we take the rough idea of an ESS and make that the mechanism by which alliances collect their ratting taxes.

Would that be pure cancer for alliance logistics?  Absolutely, sorry guys.  But it would also mean that the alliance's wealth is somewhere that can be attacked, skimmed, and shut off, and also that it's vulnerable to ganking when the tax man comes to collect.

---
Dreadbombing or parking 3 leshaks on one would end it pretty quickly with little to no counter by the defender. It would have 2 RF timers, but no damage cap.  
---
So you could still dread bomb it in a single cycle to get 1st RF, rinse/repeat for the 2nd. Leaving it with no RF, means you just insta-pop it with the amount of capitals in the game. Its a content driver, not something that just gets popped 3 days after its anchored.
---
Glad to have you, man.

Here’s something you may not know: everything you and I [and all the rest of the funny creatures in there] do in EVE Online is, by default New Eden canonic lore. Because you are there and you do what you do, you are an indelible part of the EVE experience.
---
It matters that you’re there!
---
in any sandbox video game you are going to see N+1 always winning, whining about blobs wont change how these games are played unless there is an exceptional difference between the FC's on field skill
---
Honestly i don't like the spool up timer. 
---
The biggest problem with the supers is right now supers are needed to get supers ( and the biggest super fleet means the best super production ).
---
Now a small easy fixes would be: 
---
Remove the rorqs ability to both cyno and panic ( cyno up means no panic panic means you can't cyno until your out of panic ), i would do the same for triage and siege ( and likely an active NSA might need to look at cycle time there ). 
---
Don't get me wrong this is absolutely a boost to cyno jammers against caps as now caps are forced to make a decision, and cyno sub caps are more vulnerable, but it still gives the defender options.
---
Also it means subcaps get a roll again in defending and the attacker has more of a warning then cyno is up caps land on grid giving them some disengage options.
---
How well does this work honestly not sure, like it could result in people just having a cyno carrier ready but without a NSA running honestly a carrier is not that scary for subcaps because the lock time is painful. ( and you can force the light early because well cyno jammer ).
---
If caps have some penalty for lighting there gonna be less willing to do so and subcaps already can be snipped ( putting jump time pressure on the cap pilots, pressure means people will make mistakes ). 
---
The last thing the game needs is more arbitrary waiting before you can actually kill something. Kspace is bad enough that citadels don't even drop loot, making people wait days just to blow something up takes risk out of the game and turns it from a raiding mechanic to a boring grindfest. 
---
They could hardly make them worse.

According to Sion, he was barred from running because they don't like his abrasive personality or something. Officially, CCP only made a change to the rules that people who work for non-CCP exclusive gaming media companies (and TMC/Imperium.news covers other games so that rule applies to them) aren't allowed to be on the CSM due to conflicts of interest.
---
What did NoobmanHK do? I thought he was seeing out his CSM term and then quitting EVE?

There's no *direction*. Only once have I seen any CCP leader point in a direction and say "this is where EVE is going!" And that leader (Seagull) failed to get the rest of the company to follow her, though I don't know if it was her management or the troops that caused her vision to fail. Even Jon Lander, whom I love, never stated a concrete long term direction or goals for EVE.
---
So what ends up happening is that you have the same ten or twelve ideas that bounce around the building endlessly until they are either partially implemented and then fail for lack of iteration, or never get implemented with the champion of that idea wistfully claiming that the idea will fix EVE.
---
Why not just make it cheaper and one-shot destructable? Give attackers the satisfaction of blowing it up and stealing the loot - then make defenders go drop a new one and start the ramp again. 
---
Smart bombing in hisec will get you concorded very easily.
---
You must be new...
---
It sounds like I would be a StarWars droid doesn’t it?
---
So they can quit their corp to an NPC corp mid fight?? That triggers Concord?
---
This is your opinion
---
I do agree with you. But on the filp side, who is going to be wanting to replace their ESS/bounty system everyday after someone wants to troll and dreadbomb each system everyday? Or roam around in some leshaks popping the ESS in every system before the defender can form up properly.
---
Its a necessary evil to have some time for the defender to prepare to defend the structure. Otherwise it just becomes an easy way to burn people out. Its possible to adjust it to 1 RF timer, but its still a timer.  
---
I don't think there will ever be a structure that you can just 1 shot out of existence, hell, dominion had RF timers for POS. The game has always had timers. Even fucking depots have timers. Its CCP's way of balancing for the guy who is on vacation or away from the game for a couple days not to lose their shit immediately.
---
You may not like it, but that is literally have every structure is setup. If you have an alternative that isn't just "allow me to insta-gib this structure with my 5 dreads", i'm sure all of us, including CCP would like to hear it.
---
I don't think it needs to be that complicated. Just making the ESS near-mandatory and giving big incentives to fight over it from people roaming in your space will help in many ways.
---
wait wait wait. Your account is 3 hours old and you also only post about this thing?
---
Why the fuck are you creating multiple accounts to shill this shit?
---
You define them as "not a Goon."
---
The current system is indeed broken. STV should have worked but primarily due to player laziness and disinterest in the process, it has failed.
---
CCP should select CSM members much more the way they select Alliance Tournament commentators: a given potential rep should be asked to put together a portfolio of the play styles they represent with specific, provable examples that they know about that play style. Then CCP should pick the ten or twelve people they want for a year based on those portfolios.

I have had a long rant about transparency with you already if you want a perfect example this is it.
---
No seriously have a convo with CCP about getting there minutes right on crediting people with what the bring up ( this allows voters to get better insight in what the people they vote for made the argument for ), let's give you the benefit of the doubt here and say you really did i mean it would help you if you could quote the minutes and shut me up.
---
&gt; The guys who aren't present and who aren't approachable aren't approachable for exactly this reason - they don't have the tolerance for being shit on that I do

There is this thing that's public life, like I get there perspective but the flip side is when people are unhappy the tend to go for the people that have the power to change it. 
---
&gt; Folks complain that CSMers aren't in the community, but the ones who are get shit on so hard that the others don't even bother. It's kind of dumb.
---
There is kinda a thing of mass here that comes in to play, like for me this is a single convo tree, and while i might be direct ( or even wrong ), like in my mind it isn't different then I would talk to anybody else.
---
Where as from you perspective i'm like person 1012 that get's on your case about something, and yes i get it i'm likely exactly the person you seek to avoid, i do get how that get's tiring from the CSM members perspective but if you take any random member of the community they likely would not view there conversation as particularly insulting because it's a single conversation and the 1 or 2 insults that fly back and forward all that big of a deal.

So if you say that I would find enough rats in goons space for a carrier, I believe it will be the same for the other alliance. Is it the same for mining?

---
There was once a time before damage caps and repair timers where to defend a structure you had to put ships on the line repairing it to try and reach a threshold where it became safe again or just give your self more time to try and win the battle, which meant both sides had a lot more influence on the fight and no one needed artificial damage caps.
---
CCP decided everyone universally hated sitting in triage repping structures (which, to be fair, was nothing more than a chore if the timer was uncontested) so they replaced the idea of ships repairing structures at all with static repair timers, and with the inability for defenders to influence how long a structure can live or if it goes invuln again, they had to also artificially limit attacker DPS.
---
Basically, damage caps can't just go away in a vacuum or contested structure fights would be futile for the defender, they have to bring back being able to rep structures so both sides can scale incoming DPS/reps, and put ships on the line in order to do so. People would be much happier as they can ref uncontested stuff easier/faster, and everyone would have more options during contested structure fights, including trying to just frag faxes if you didn't think you could realistically kill the structure through reps.
---
So What, Yes stay away.
---
I always liked the idea of an online/offline structure that could be contested for a local/no local in the given constalation

---
Small tackle has to die to extract from grid. I was busy exploding twice so I didn't even get that far into the process.
---
I appreciate your post, and I read it all.  I understand they are a sounding board, not decision makers at CCP.  My opinion is the negative impact of having CSM members who leak upcoming patch info outweighs the 5-15% of the time they can actually make a difference.  I also believe there have been enough negative PR incidents (not leaks, but bad behavior) that the combined in-game and out-of-game negative impact isn't worth it.  Looking at this thread, it's clear many people think it's just Goon CSM and no one else's voices will be heard.  Even if every Goon candidate takes his/her job seriously and advocates for the entire player base, that's not the perception.  Brisc Rubal may very well advocate for everyone as he claims, but he acts like a Goon mouthpiece on reddit with a CSM flair.  That hurts the average player's overall view of the CSM.    
---
My bottom line is whatever good is done isn't outweighed by the bad.  And these days, with the increased monetization and seeming focus on making Eve safer for the average player, I'm voting with my feet.  
---
And now it's our best advertisement. Funny how that worked out, isn't it?
---
Nope, swap from PIRAT who may have a lot of decs and potential enemies to a "new" corp that only have the structure owners as potential enemies. 
---
Recently for instance, PIRAT came for a Fortizar in highsec and was greeted by a 160 man goon fleet. PIRAT promptly fled, except for those who went straight into the 'alt' corp that was not at war with goons and went right back to bashing the structure, untouchable. 
---
We can fill all of those seats with Imperium members.
---
I agree CCP did the right thing blocking a racist.  My bigger point is that CSM members fairly routinely hurt the game either by leaking info or by acting like dicks and making everyone look bad.  Both are good reasons to get rid of the damn thing.  If CCP wants to keep chatting with good former CSM members (Steve Ronuken, etc.), there's nothing stopping them.  But why add in the risk of leaks and other bad PR?
---
Is this some sort of malware or something?

---
I refer you to my previous comment
---
And whose fault is that?
---
&gt; "Worked as fine as it can" - Capri pointed out the criticism of that panel in particular, especially the outcome.
---
I mean I hate some of the ways CCP changed T3Cs and I've been the most vocal about it. But there is always something to be upset about. It wasn't that bad. It definitely did its job, people are generally fine with the way T3Cs turned out, and nobody argues to reverse the changes.
---
&gt; I still think the amount of work is way too much, and groups of that size are completely unwieldy.
---
I'd welcome an argument on why. CCP selects 8-12 groups of 10-20 to have casual, non-mandatory, unstructured conversation on discord. The conversation on discord would be non-mandatory for CCP devs, except there is at least one dev on each discord channel. I think some devs would even welcome it as a direct feedback source. The time spent by CCP on CSM itself wouldn't change. The only extra time is the selection of focus groups, which might take a (well-worth) week or two of the CCP community team. Then the maintenance of focus groups would perhaps take a day or two of the community team each year. That's not a lot of work for a better functioning feedback mechanism. And all that's assuming the community team is just 2 people.
---
Perhaps instead of speculating, we can ask how much time it took for CCP to form some focus groups as well. I'm confident it won't turn out to be something like 150 dev hours. It'll probably be more like 5 hours per group.
---
&gt; I would also argue that folks who haven't worked within the confines of the existing system aren't really able to know the real shortcomings, because they don't see what actually happens, just the perception.
---
The claim at stake here (what I mainly mean by 'shortcoming') is that certain playstyles are over/underrepresented. I don't have to be a CSM to know that my playstyle is underrepresented. There are places I can acquire that knowledge. CSM members often disclose their approaches to problems. There are sources like CSM minutes. And there is data on what CCP actually does. So I can independently confirm that my playstyle is underrepresented. Meanwhile, you can only believe that you are representing my playstyle. You have no way of knowing my particular problems unless you play Eve as I do. Even if you occasionally played as I do, you might choose to represent your constituents' dominant playstyle. So you can't actually verify whether you are representing my issues. Therefore, you are too immersed in your playstyle to represent mine, whereas I don't have to be a CSM to realize the shortcoming of over/underrepresentation of certain playstyles.
---
Rip
---
I like the concept but honestly, give it an acceleration gate and make it deadspace, no caps. Otherwise you just get hyper hels warping in and you can't even dread bomb them. 
---
Elected government officials routinely hurt their country either by taking advantage of their power or by acting like dicks and making everyone else worse off. Both are good reasons to get rid of the damn thing. If America wants to keep chatting with good former politicians (lol), there's nothing stopping them. But why add in the risk of crony capitalism and other bad PR?
---
honestly, i'd rather go back to the old Pos days where triage could rep structures. making it a tug of war where you can kill their logi if the pos is to hard.
---
but make it have a repair timer in case no attacking force shows up for it, that way you don't need to logi rep it every time,  only if enemy shows up and you contest.
---
or....at the very least.  remove dmg cap from low power structures,   or structures in enemy Sov space(can make it so their dmg cap is higher and higher based on enemy sov strength in said system)
---
or heck, make it so dmg cap si based on how many people are on grid!
---
Yeah just imagine if there wasn't about a year and something between that and your "don't report bots" declaration. But yeah regardless if it was luck or just good planning it turned out pretty great for you.

Clever; this very thread is the evidence that supports the argument (while flying over the heads of many) and at the same time the statement is fodder for subsequent angry rants.

I would very much like to see an in game, client supported/integrated CSM voting mechanism, it would certainly encourage me to vote for future CSM's. Because of what I perceive to be a tedious voting process with a general lack of knowledge about any of the candidates I have voted once in ten years of playing.

The burst of activity for the first few days was just people trying out the new shiny toy, anyone at all familiar with Eve could have seen that Abyssal PvP as it is currently designed was completely DoA in the long-term.
---
Currently, Abyssal PvP requires you running a hybrid PvE/PvP build through a relatively tough 10 to 20 minute PvE zone to even get a chance that maybe a PvP gate will spawn giving you the opportunity to lose all your loot, ship, and pod.  Create separate PvP filaments centered around two or more ships fighting over a loot pinata with rapidly scaling resist debuffs after the first couple minutes to prevent blueballing and Abyssal PvP would get plenty of use.

We aren't war decced. This guys randomly decided he would attack us with like 7 of our guys in local. The joke here was just the insane war deccing high sec corp/alliance came to low sec and fucked up. He appeared to be in the system next door for 2 days but after we sent him back to Jita he seems to have regained his forethought and stays there high sec blapping war targets.
---
&gt; subreddit want to troll the mods 
---
Oh those poor, sweet summer children.
---
Fucking spodbrain. 
---
Why are you even in our corp?
---
But no rorqual are in danger, let's give them an invincibility button. 
---
So then why did you completely ignore feedback on the proposed T3C and D changes, on rorquals (panic and drone yield), removal of advanced sound settings, and the new shitty Agency window? If you guys are just going to go back to the once-a-year patches, at least let us know. 
---
Oh god no
---
The flashbacks. 
---
It can, problem is how to  obtain data from game to clock or at least to smartphone 
---
&gt; So we're gonna put in the people who get that done
---
Never said the opposite or missed this picture. You'll get the candidate who'll get the job done for yourself. But often times, our playstyles are in conflict. So your candidate will not get the job done for me.
---
&gt; The idea that CCP can't tell if one of our reps is blatantly proposing stuff in our own self interest is dumb
---
I agree CSM can almost never manipulate CCP into changes they want. But there are different ways to operate out of self interest.
---
- You can choose your own constituents' (and your own) playstyle/feedback over competing playstyles in certain issues.
---
- You might not be aware of other playstyles' concerns, and provide one-sided feedback, while genuinely believing in your feedback.
---
- You might be aware of other playstyles' concerns, yet you can omit from sharing them with CCP when asked.
---
I'd argue each of these cases are valid for current and past CSMs.
---
&gt; The reality is that we keep winding up on top because we've got organization, a decade of organizational knowledge, numbers, and an utter lack of shame in changing our playstyle to wind up on top of the current meta. We're going to minmax the CSM voting system because that's what we do and it was hilarious to get as much of it as we did this year.
---
You've got all that. None of them should give you the ability to shape this beautiful game into your own playstyle. I think you are slowly and cancerously killing the very game you enjoy by doing that. I do not call shame on you though. It's worthless and stupid to blame player behavior in anything Eve related. It's on CCP to insist on directly elections.
---
FYI, this should be fixed as of tomorrow's patch.

---
If it is not, shout real loud ok!?
---
I wonder which one has costlier sov 
---
So when you come to delve and see a fax and super (or even HAW titan) guarding every ESS, then what is your small gang going to do? 
---
&gt;To be fair SRP on strat ops are all you need in my opinion. You help the allaince you're in, if you lose your ship you get it back. 
---
Ok, but when the alliance makes a shitload of Isk off the average line members work (e.g., highsec markets), well, the average line member earns the right to get some of that Isk back through things like generous SRP programs.
---
That only works if leadership isn't stealing all the Isk.
---
Jo, the planets are awesome, try not to play on potato mode you fag 
---
Good analysis, very much agree. The rorqual needs to be rework in such a way that it is impossible to ignore as a fleet booster, but doesn't actually make much money itself.
---
Delete excavators, buff exhumers, and buff rorqual mining links. Panic shouldn't affect all other ore ships either, just the rorq. 
---
Creepy pedo
---
It's news to me and I was *in* skillu...
---
I think at it's core the origin of the repair timer we have is probably them wanting to get rid of the chore aspect of having to sit and rep uncontested shields back up, but they just went one further without really thinking about it and at this point it's such a core thing to upwell structures i doubt they'd walk it back.
---
In an ideal world there'd be no damage cap, ships would have to rep structures past a treshold to bring them back to full power/save them, and the structure would slowly tick back health over the course of like, 5-6 hours if no one followed up on the attack so defenders didn't have to sit there in an osprey bringing shields back up to bring the structure out of limbo, and everything was at the power of players again.
---
it's a natural phenomenon, there's no need to be shy
---
So you can see all of it.
---
That window C H O N K .
---
Care to provide some examples, or just going to be vague on purpose when you don't actually have anything all that spooky that goons don't already do?
---
Why the fuck would we need a year to do that? We could turn that shit around inside of two weeks if we wanted to. If you're going to make dumb accusations, at least make them believable.
---
inb4 bookmarks disappearing or warping to safe but warped to sun
---
It would be false to make him belive that we are not a bunch of shittlers 
---
I did think about giving it an acceleration gate, but then you'd just have insta-locking ships sitting on the gate or the accel gate bubbled with supers sitting around it. Pretty much the same issue.
---
That's awesome dude, more the merrier. I hope your local EVE community keeps growing.
---
Yep, same retard also posted a "leaked mining op" 6 months ago that they didn't even do anything with.
---
Are you stupid? Do you have any idea how much better this game looks now than it did 10 years ago? Rofl. Go play a different game.
---
Ahhhh so that's what the medium boosters were for. 
---
Personally I liked the abyssal content and I think many people did, but...
---
Didn't somebody from CCP come out and basically say something like "We didn't see revenue increase when we spent more on development" some time ago ? They probably know how fucked up much of the game balance is, but figured out that focusing $$$ on art/skin team gave them the most out of their investment. Of course this model is extra destructive for a game like EVE which has a strong network effect and needs the goodwill of players

Nothing.  That’s what resource depletion is for.
---
Indeed, I do, too. I simply want them to do something to enhance Lowsec.
---
that's because when you fight with no goal or objective, you need to make one up otherwise people stop participating.
---
I recommend talking to Chesterfield Fancypantz about wormholes - a very influential figure who gets a lot of praise from the wormhole community. 
---
God, discussions in the Eve population are a true shit show. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
If those two events would have happened two weeks apart nobody would have questioned the motive for the asasination attempt(to hide the massive botting going on, glimses of which we saw when the gm;s selected some bots to bring in yulai). The time in between the two worked in your advantage.
---
How are they an 'unmitigated shitshow'? They work, very reliably. The 'easy way' to copy them from Char A to Char B (dragging them into items, then trading them to the other char) could be more elegant, but overall bookmarks work pretty damn well.
---
I would LOVE to just have to old "warp drive active" back. So much better.
---
That is also my favorite. Or at the very least that datacores would be replaced with some rare resource that only spawns in universally known systems so that they generate content akin to the old R64 moons. Possibly also have these provide stupid NPC items like hydrogen batteries (that you otherwise need to buy from NPCs to make t2 shield extenders), since the idea is to make nullsec industry self-sufficient from highsec. 
---
I'm thinking it could be an incursion-like boss site, possibly with the trigonometry people acting as the enemy. Then upon destruction the alliance ticker that gets the highest damage (repping the target negates the damage done by the other alliances), gets a stack of "datacore replacements" from concord in some lowsec station (the lore would be that we helped concord defeat this trigonometry enemy incursion). Each time the datacore would be different, so if you secured the kill you'd have a monopoly on that datacore-replacement market for a couple months (and possibly a monopoly on the stupid NPC item like hydrogen batteries, can't think of another such stupid item off the top of my head). 
---
Neither is "socket closed"
---
You do realize space exists that isn't delve right? Large swaths of space that are just bots or less organized entities live where this will have a large use.
---
We get it, Goons are organized, i prefer not to roam your area of space. That doesn't mean every other nullsec entity is setup the same exact way. And, should by some stroke of luck you park all your alts in a bubble, cyno jammed ESS in each system. That just means there are less titans/carriers for you to drop on people actually roaming through your systems until you move them out of the ESS.
---
Your gates don't have titans/supers on every single gate 24/7. Just like you won't have Titans/Supers on your ESS' 24/7. Maybe in the beginning, but eventually you need that alt for something or you'll need to move. Stop pretending you can setup 24/7 omnipresence.
---
We need something, and there will never be innovation and new features/content without actually having a discussion. It's honestly amazing that CCP continues to at least TRY to move forward and involve the player base in the process.
---
My eyes aren't 2ft apart so I can't see all of it.
---
False.    No one told us not to post on reddit.   Were just dead so ita hard to do both? 
---
If they (you) don't do PVE at all why they (you) even want sov? 
---
For that matter, why do anyone who don't want to "build an empire", want sov at all? Wouldn't the alliance have less upkeep if they staged out of an NPC station? 
---
if you think that's a long ping, you should see Dreddit discord
---
. ______ .
---
Well done fella well done
---
savage!
---
Unfortunately the ESI endpoints we would need would make botting that much easier so i doubt there will ever be a good way to hook that up :(
---
How about you organize something?  We are playing in a giant space-sandbox.
---
I think you should study NPC kills on the map, even in a region like delve we're not spread out evenly on all systems, we'd have plenty to defeat the pathetic enemies we see. 
---
There is no way to track something like that.
---
Mining probably is even easier since moon mining changes since you get nice moon goo available about everywhere
---
are you spying, shouldn't you stay away, what's wrong in telling people about something, new account or old account?
---
You haven't really thought about this very much, have you? You're describing an incredibly passive, pussyfooted way of going about making botting work. Why the fuck would we ever do it that way? Why the fuck would censoring the MER somehow HIDE bot activity? CCP doesn't censor the data towards themselves, and players have about as much intelligence as loose gravel.

---
Its a physical irl clock
---
No, we don't need more instanced pvp. We need objectives to fight over that doesn't involve circling a button for 37.5 hours if the enemy doesn't even show up to defend even 1 fw site.
---
&gt; CCP doesn't censor the data towards themselves
---
CCP only acts against bots when there's reports and public outrage. They didn;t eem to care much untill recently.
---
So on one hand the reports are missing and on the other the public outrage is missing.
---
This is not about making botting work. I'm sure you(goons) have a lot of experience. Is about protecting as many of those bots from ban's and other inconvienency's that would result if ccp was outraged into taking measures.
---
what's stopping the botters from just TZ tanking the ESS
---
as you've pointed out at least in the replies, this is mostly targeted at empty botting space, where there's dozens of contiguous systems of gilas and no actual residents... in some cases well out of cyno range from the nearest living organism
---
if the botters can just set them to aussie time then who is going to go out of their way to bash them?
---
I think this would be cool but only if there was some big incentive for the attacker on a successful first timer (assuming its always vulnerable like citadel shields)... otherwise the game doesn't need another alarm clock
---
Statistically you'll still get jammed by a single ceptor before a T1 toaster even cycles once, and sitting there while ceptors just spam dicerolls on you isn't content.
---
The face does not control the muscles behind it
---
You really believe that, don't you? That's really disheartening to hear.
---
Would be cool to be able to display eve time as well as local time on that bad boy too
---
I guess i didn't clarify in the OP. I never had any intention of it having an "invuln state", so it would always be vulnerable. Timers would be based on when it went in Reinforcement.
---
Yeah I know, I'm lenient, one of my biggest flaws, trying to be a good man in eve :D, and to be fair, we all were pretty god damn spergy back in Blade. I think I still have you (like, 87% sure it's you), xenermorph, mjukis and a few other on facebook aswell.
---
I don't expect you to audit my peeps, but I appreciate anything we can look into to make the time we spend hunting more efficient. It ain't really why I play eve so I wanna make the bots caught/hour spent ratio as high as possible. and trust me, we have ways of telling who's a bot :D
---
I actually do have a clause in the eviction mails I've been sending that I could just start enforcing "It is expected that your Corporation will handle its departure from its systems promptly and with civility. Further violations of the INIT. System Rental Policy, or aggression toward members of INIT. IM, or IA during your move-out, will not be tolerated and will result in immediate revocation of your docking and access rights as well as forceful eviction." - by the word of the law, botting is against the renting policy so I could be less lenient, food for thought. 
---
&gt;(also knowing we cant easily reship since we had no citadel up)
---
Your not only wrong your it's like easy to show everyone.
---
So here is the first tower pops: https://zkillboard.com/kill/73910037/ 
---
Now here is the Hac fight on a random kill: 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73941013/
---
Now notice that the time stamp for the Tower is 2018-12-08 16:19 where as the Hac died at 2018-12-10 00:06, this means if you anchored at 2018-12-08 23:59 at 2018-12-09 23:59 your citadel should have been up now that gives you 6 hours and 40 minutes from the tower kill to start you anchoring process. 
---
Meaning you should have had citadels up by the timer the hac's started contesting hole control. ( if you didn't that's on your logistics team ).
---
Unless you not talking about the 160 man fleet ( aka the only big fight ), Given the fleet's where rolling from the 9th but you won't take my word for it so here is the guy that warped to the formup on the amarr gate (there was still had an hope there was no rage roll at this point) with a kill right on him https://zkillboard.com/kill/73922588/ Notice that the choice of doctrine was already made at this point, because you gonna say that's just a random bunch of people sitting in amarr here is that cerb a day later in Rage: https://zkillboard.com/kill/73941223/ 
---
Now there is a possibility HK controlls Zkill, but i'm gonna guess the Zkill timestamps are reasonably in the ball park of real times. 
---
you mean 6000 km
---
We are :D
---
From the non-space-rich crowd, I think it's a problem of not wanting to get into a guaranteed dogfight with a super-pimped out cruiser flown by a max-skills, drugged out, homocidal maniac with billions in implants smashed into his face.
---
you might notice by looking at abyssal losses that even NPC losses essentially halt during USTZ. Seems like USTZ players just don't run abyssal sites in general.
---
In my experience the whole game is a lot more lively and active during EUTZ, so maybe there's just a lot fewer USTZ players in the game than I thought.
---
Two fold: first, Seagull presented a slide several years running that showed four areas that were going to be rebuilt from scratch (corp/alliance management, industry, sov, structures) in preparation for and as a prelude to her space colonization strategy including "new types of space, new world properties, and mechanics".
---
In the end, it's pretty easy to see that this whole vision was scrapped and the few ideas the team had on the ultimate goal were put into the various types of abyssal space.
---
Second, Seagull actually sat down and created a road map for the development of EVE over a several year period and showed this road map to both her dev team and the CSM.
---
I don’t run billions in implants...
---
If it was 6km the client would display it in meters.
---
Good catch. 
---
Went for big air. Missed. RIP
---
Yeah but the new structures operate differently, each ticket calculates the damage received, then caps it.
---
Use a wormhole to take a shortcut.
---
Once your cargo starts to fill up check out wormholes and see if any have hisec or lowsec statics.
---
nice i've been winning eve for almost two years now lmao

you know. we could consider hirable npcs to rep it,  and then they flee if any enemies show up to shoot them.

Would you kindly explain what kool aid is there in witnessing MBC dogpile on TEST after Goons got kicked from the north? Jesus I was running entosis on those systems.

/r dragonsfuckingspaceships
---
This is EVE mate. Everyone's a spy.
---
wow yeah, that sounds really enticing, especially the part where getting podded means I have to login an alt to probe my way back from highsec!
---
This is the funny thing - I've never called myself "a wormhole representative."  I have said, from the beginning, that I viewed this job as representing the entire game, not any one particular area or playstyle, and that's how I was going to treat my time in this gig. 
---
What I did was offer to advocate on behalf of the WH community because there was no one else who was willing to do it. I've repeatedly done that, and I am still doing that. 
---
Why is that a bad thing? 
---
I've been down on the all-null CSM for years. In particular, I pointed to a stunning rebuke by Hilmar of the all-null CSM; he once had an opportunity to say something bland about CSM helpfulness and instead stated that a CSM with "one voice" wasn't helpful to CCP. And I've given my own opinion that a CSM with only a couple of play styles represented is not at all useful for CCP. I am quite proud of the team CSM8 had, given that we had strong null, w-space, low-sec, and newer player voices.
---
I agree with you that no CSM since has been able to match this line-up, and it's clearly because STV caught the null-sec blocs by surprise. Once they figured out how to dominate the process, dominate it they did. So I agree with you that the CSM selection process should be radically altered to be something closer to the selection process for AT commentators (see my other reply in this thread on that).
---
So yeah, I agree with you: the current CSM mechanics are non-ideal. But I disagree that the CSM does more harm than good. Even in its current state, the CSM can advocate to try to stop or slow down the madness. With no CSM at all, there would be few or no ways for players to influence the process directly.
---
Finally, voting with your feet is a perfectly valid option. As of this morning, I've made that choice myself (my last sub ran out during DT this morning; Ripard's sub ran out last week). Today's the first time I've been unsubbed from EVE in 12 years -- I hung on through the Summer of Rage. I'll be hanging around here until Fanfest or so to see what, if anything, CCP might be announcing for 2019. But based on the last three years, I don't have a lot of hope and I suspect I'll be winning EVE permanently shortly after Fanfest.
---
But that also isn't the CSM's fault. ;-)
---
Good point!
---
It's almost like I have actual experience handling player feedback for a game in roughly the same format; of course that's going to get recognized by someone in the industry. Source: used to be a developer and player feedback team coordinator for a much smaller MMO.
---
They're putting SPODUMAIN in the SKILL INJECTORS to turn the freakin' devs goon!
---
Yeah, it sucks. Every now and again you piss off the other TZs bad enough they alarm clock and then they curb-stomp you for trying. Also PST player btw.
---
Delve isn't the only system on the map cupcake.
---
Looking on Dotlan ([http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve/2019-01-13#npc24](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve/2019-01-13#npc24)), it looks like you have a handful of heavy ratting systems, but the rest of your systems still get a considerable amount of NPC kills minus a few border sytems. Especially when you compare to other regions. You think i'm talking about hitting your dedicated ratting systems and not your outlier systems? 
---
No more hearing anddor whine and always, ALWAYS contradicting me? Sign me up! 
---
I just don't see the point in any kind of insults. I almost never insult anybody, even when they're shitting on me hard (I say almost never, because I know I've done it, everybody has). Generally I just ignore it and keep talking. 
---
If I was really the pompous, arrogant retard that you guys think I am, why would I be wasting my time even having a conversation with you?

---
lol so you want all the "danger" of wh space without it being hard? k.
---
you take ma song? good music but thief! 
---
I'm sure you don't, but the worst-case is a guaranteed loss just because you didn't sink enough ISK into your setup to be even competitive (regardless of actual player skill). I can see why that would be avoided.
---
This - I used to do a lot of explo in null using a covert ops. Find a WH chain to high sec and dump off loot in a station. I'd start to get nervous when I got north of 100mil in my hold.
---
I don't know mindless drone tell me.
---
If you are still quite new to people behaving and trapping scanners (yes, that is a thing) I would suggest starting out in Wormhole Space first and learn their mechanics. Not only as mentioned before they could get handy later on while camped in in Null, but also there is less traffic and competition. Wormhole Space features the same Relic and Data Sites as Null (Loot wise) so you practice the Minigame at harder difficulties aswell (Containers with Red Core).  
---
As this doesn't quite get clear through your describtion, I would suggest only flying a Astero when you feel confident and you are able to fly cloaking ontop of that. Start small with a T1 Scanning frigate until you are confident enough.
---
(To explain why I suggest it: Making your money back for a 2 Mil T1 Frig is way easier than for a 80Mil fit out Astero)  
---
Fly Safe o7 
---
Olmeca, I just don't know what to say at this point. If you honestly think that selecting 240 people, then setting up a secure discord, getting them all to sign NDAs, and the like is not a big deal and really easy to set up, I don't know what to tell you. 
---
The entire paragraph about "playstyles" and representation comes down basically to trust. You don't trust that players who don't actively fly a certain way will represent concerns. That's unfortunate, and there's not much I can say that's going to change your mind. All I can do is try to do a good job and show you that you're wrong. 
---
You see, here is the base of the problem. It often shows that the company you’re representing is so disconnected from its own game that you can’t even recognise competent people and selectively listen to them. Since you are making analogies with real life : nobody in real life runs elections to hire experts and consultants. You need the basics to be able to chose your advisors and decide what you’re taking into account and what you need to ignore to not be manipulated. If csm is to represent the players then just do it as a side lore/community event. You don’t even need representatives to get the pulse of the community. If you want knowledgeable people then get yourself to the level of being able to find the ones you need, ask them the good questions and take their answers with caution. Running through a popularity contest won’t help you for this.
---
It's nice to see that even after leaving Provi, Evictus still eats shit on the daily.

Highsec mechanics need unfucked. Just make everything lowsec or null. 
---
Copying them could "be more elegant" dude I have 7k bookmarks of strat points above gates in like 2/3 of EVE, if I ever want to copy them I better start just after DT because it'll take me to the next DT to finish.  They are just DB entries, it should be 1 button to copy them.  Even if I press a button in a station and it takes 4 hours or some shit, I shouldn't have to sit there and manually drag them 10 BMs at a time.

I said perhaps 2 weeks would be needed for this. Make it a month. Limit focus groups by 10. Don't share NDA info with them. There is some workable solution here without costing an unreasonable amount of CCP time. Again, CCP should know better how much the formation of other focus groups costed them. But even without knowing anything, I can postulate that if they choose to spend time to form a focus group for something like T3C changes, they can spend 8 to 12 times that as a one-time effort for a well-functioning CSM system. 
---
It's always easier to argue for the status quo and poke holes vs. someone pushing for a change. Merely because all proposals are hypotheticals. Particularly if you are the party enjoying the status quo.
---
&gt; The entire paragraph about "playstyles" and representation comes down basically to trust.
---
I do lack that trust. Many others as well, since such thoughts often gain traction. But it's not a mere trust issue where we don't have any epistemic access on whether you are actually representing us. I can actually broadly check and measure how much different people on CSM represent my playstyle, from the sources I just outlined. It's not that I don't trust whether a particular CSM member can represent me. I can see he is not representing me.
---
How is this even allowed here, this is just some dumb weeb porn. 
---
Absolutely for missions where you fight against one of the four factions as their ships all drop tags which can be very valuable. I recently did a 5 part mission series and looted (no salvage) 90 mil of tags.
---
His point is that there are no really similar games (at least until star citizen releases, whenever that is).
---
This game has so many aspects that others dont, which is why many people leave and then come back eventually, including myself. 2 years of overwatch competitive gameplay and I'm getting back into eve because it's always there and always fun.
---
I think people would actually be interested in this sort of thing, alone though. Not with the abyssal rooms to go with it. 
---
Look at abyssal PVP right now and ask yourself if the game likes instanced pvp
---
Haha yeah :)
---
Do both.
---
No damage cap, but can repair or let it time out. Damage threshold to pause timer, but no cap. So you can save it with enough triage or also, bash it with dreads and overcome the reps.
---
Threshold would still pause if it was reached, just the shields/armor/Hull wouldn't go down if the reps were more. 
---
I'd dare say lock it to the reps required for that cycle even. God forbid you let it get to the Hull timer.
---
It's less about finding those people, that part isn't the problem.
---
The problem is when we select people, and the inevitable torrent of allegations of bias arise because we've made a decision that selects someone from one specific alliance over the other.
---
Letting the community choose is by far the preferred choice.
---
Fucking savage
---
I mean, you call us mindless drones, but we manage to do basic, grade-school level organization. 
---
fix this one too /u/Jintaan please
---
Haha, mostly tongue in cheek.  But the attention this thread received today tells me I'm not alone in my thinking.  
---
Afaik she just didn't want to do it or doesn't do that kind of work any more.
---
Point taken on nr 2 ! :)
---
And yeah I somehow brain farted on troposphere to be just 6km as the peak of mt.everest is 8,8km and it's definetely still in the earths atmosphere (even though thin as it is on that altitude).
---
ojala ojala  bueno tu sabes como son las cosas aca pero seguro se hace lo que se puede gracias bro
---
sunesis maybe? 
---
&gt; In conjunction with this, if anomalies were changed to deplete over time or have longer respawns, it would prevent large alliances from turtling up in a select few systems and force them to move around. That is a whole other topic in itself, but figured i'd mention it here as it would pair well with this.
---
I know this is a side issue. But depletion over time would just push alliances to cycle systems. They already do it for moon mining.
---
[Here is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) a better way to balance anomalies.
---
move to delve to shoot you
---
What is the current best process to copy bookmarks?
---
it's not hard, it's dead easy. you just probe out of the wormhole on your alt, then set destination from your main and burn out in a travel ceptor.  It's literally just tedium for the sake of tedium.
---
I can't even imagine the mental gymnastics necessary to convince yourself that you should have to do a graveyard run in a game where you reincarnate into lab-grown bodies instantly upon death, with the justification that it's "hard" to fly a nullified ship from Amarr to your hole.
---
Sorry to see you go.  And I know the CSM isn't to blame for everything going wrong.  But I also don't see them helping.  Maybe they are behind the scenes, but as the average unimportant Eve player, I'm not actually seeing it.  And if I can't see it, why should I believe it or trust it in the face of the negative stuff I can see?  
---
But either way, I guess it doesnt matter to me in the end.  I'm out once I gather my last bits of isk from a market alt to send to some old corp mates.  I'd let my two accounts go to an unsub, but I think I need to biomass to be sure I don't get sucked back in. 
---
"Brisc Rubal may very well advocate for everyone as he claims, but he acts like a Goon mouthpiece on reddit with a CSM flair."
---
What on earth are you talking about?  
---
Titan entosis! :P 
---
You drag them from your people and places to your cargo hold in a station, then transfer them to the other character as you would any other item.  I believe you can only copy out a few at a time, though to be honest I haven't tried in a while.  And the client will only copy 1 or 2 a second.
---
You're a smug shit.  Whether it's done as a joke or not, you certainly don't act like a representative of the entire player base.  You're a CSM now, yet you regularly act awfully dismissive of people outside your goon block.  Hint: you're not being downvoted by HK salt mines.  It's because very few people outside of Goons like you.  
---
Kelish is a nice enough dude, but lmao if you think dropping his name means anything. You name drop a line member and want credibility from it? 
---
Idk if you've realized it yet, but praise bob spends most of its time laughing at you. Can't say you're respected there, but I'm sure you'll justify it somehow. 
---
&gt;We get it, Goons are organized, i prefer not to roam your area of space. That doesn't mean every other nullsec entity is setup the same exact way.
---
Maybe this would have people try to copy the delve model. If that is the case, I'm for it. Its about time the north and east started actually churning out some industrial might so that we can party like its 2019 (meaning more dreadbombs and capital fights). 
---
Have you learned what we mean when we use the term "locust fleet"? We move our supercapital umbrella elsewhere to mine a region of goo in like 3 hours. We could do the same with ratting and just cycle through regions week by week. Everyone else would be boned. 
---
lol, ahh
---
High-sec statics are pretty easy to find. So using J-space to get to a trade hub usually isn't a problem.
---
A PVP filament would actually make a lot of sense tbh. It's not like the abyssal turbokrabs are ever going to go into an arena, not when they're flying blinged-out gilas and shit (why lose your 4b+ gila and pod over the chance of getting a few hundred mil at most more loot?)
---
Ah. Xenuria, the shining beacon of hope. 
---
Every time I login in O-V and see him in local I can't help to think that no matter how hard or empty your life may be, you'll probably still have more life than him. 
---
Fortizars are not a right. They are a priveledge. 
---
When everything is a skin, nothing is...
---
Seems like a bannable exploitation of game mechanics
---
what if some group came up with a way to move massive amounts of capital mining vessels into the system, hoover up all the good stuff and then just jump away, like some kinda... locust.. fleet
---
Check out the Thera wormhole map.  I use it as a quick juncture to High and deep Null for exploration.  There are NPC stations there to store at if you want to keep exploring.
---
Well they would be exposing themselves to significant risk if they relocated close enough to hostile territory which would ultimately generate the content initially hypothesized.
---
Darius III did nothing wrong 
---
Show them the Rooks &amp; Kings videos :-)
---
While I believe you (that you’d extend this to whole regions, I know you do it in delve) to some extent I suspect that won’t really be the case. People will sprawl. But we can agree to disagree. 
---
Never known pirat to be gud
---
Cmon, why would they do work to make sure their copypasta worked right, its not like skins are $20 or anything.
---
I miss those guys (&amp; the passive isk of pos goo back in the day), kept trying my luck going solo against their shitfits, one day they got their shit together &amp; I lost my carrier xD 
---
I am currently living non stop in Nullsec space, and I regularly go to high sec to drop my loot and go back to the nullsec area.
---
Wormholes are what you are looking for. Find one going to a C1 (Wormhole description says "Unknown space - up to medium ships") or C2 (Unknown - up to large ship). Those are most of the time linked to high sec space.
---
You can see which J systems have a high sec static with this website :
---
http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelist.asp
---
When you go inside, don't forget to bookmark the wormhole you just went through.
---
I usually drop off my cargo in the first HS station I meet, then I come back to null sec as fast as possible to avoid being stuck due to a wormhole collapsing.
---
Please take into consideration that Exploration is a purely solo activity. I like it very much, but you may not like it. Or It'll be the best thing you ever do
---
Don't hesitate to send me a pm if you have questions !
---
Did you just come here to tell everyone your karmafleet app got accepted? Y
---
In all honesty, I'd love to.
---
It wasn't me dropping his name - I had some good convos with him during the HK eviction. That's why I mentioned him. 
---
I don't care whether I'm respected or not in Praise Bob. I don't care if you like me or whatever. I'm there in the event that somebody wants me to pass something on to CCP. That's it. If they don't, no biggie. They can laugh all the want. It doesn't bother me. 
---
It's likely alts and bots more than new players. I'd love to be wrong, but I seriously doubt the majority of that is actual unique players.
---
Thank you for actually putting forth a counter-point/idea.
---
Because some corps aren't fragile enough to be killed by eviction? In fact, most aren't.
---
what? no? eve is dying.
---
Molon labe! 
---
I imagine a large part of the FW issue can at least be helped by making it so Ventures can't get in the plexes. They bothered to ban Stabs, but not ships that are naturally stabbed? And how long has it been like that? This seems like a 5 minute fix. Just add that ship to the list of things that can't take the gate. 
---
If you think trying to teach someone basic economics is me having an agenda, I'm honestly touched you think that highly of me. 
---
You don't your leadership does.

You've already said you've never had a conversation with me, so where are you getting the smug from?  I'm not allowed to have a sense of humor and joke?  
---
I don't act dismissive of anyone - exactly the opposite. I mean, why would I keep taking the abuse of guys like you if I simply dismissed everything anybody outside my "goon bloc" thought? 
---
Just because you and your buddies don't like me doesn't mean that nobody outside of Goons likes me. I think you'd be surprised.

WOOP WOOP
---
fuck the lag mate.i would agree with cap fights if servers was right.regarding delve model fuck that too...it provide no content, just  semiafk farmers under super umbrella
---
I think most of us would get trashed by these hi-sec corps in hi-sec. It´s been years know but back when can flipping and shit was popular I was kinda impressed by how fucking scary hi-sec actually is. Everyone is always like "hi-sec is for the risk averse and the pve people." But to me hi-sec is scary as fuck because I know there are people out there who know every nasty trick to bend the rules in hi-sec to their favour while I don´t. 
---
We like to look down on them and compare them to us on our turf and that´s always in our favour but I mean you can´t compete with a fish in water and expect to win when you´re a bird. There are exceptions of course but at the end of day they do their shit and they do it well. I don´t know what they like about it but then I don´t need to do it right? :) 
---
Because you didn't make it fun for yourself
---
My buddy donated to their initial campaign. I ask him once a year around the date he donated if they've release yet. He just keeps saying "NAH MAN BUT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD A HUGE GAME"
---
Pretty sure it's been like, idk, 4 years?
---
No, there's just more ratting/rorqual alts/bots bc null is pretty safe. Even super carrier hulls have dropped from 16-17b to 12b in the last 6 months. 
---
Wait, are you saying we're **not** going to stop gaming the system if it's changed to slightly inconvenience us?
---
Local is bit better i guess.        
---
More people actually login and stay bit longer.
---
Every time you find a high sec exit that isn’t an island, just courier contract your loot to Jita and plunge back in. Once every week or two, fly to jita and sell it all. Since the volume is low, the couriers will be cheap... try 250k per jump or even less as long as total value is under 1b. 
---
We could single-handed cripple your regions out of your timezone with some multiboxing vexors. 
---
Or, ALL regions. All the best truesec systems (with NPC kills activity on the map) could be targeted by NGSA at once. We mine a shit ton to boot so we'd be happy nerfing ratting completely to hell because then we'd have a huge advantage. 
---
We could roll around in our famous goon blob of subcaps and just visit enemy systems one by one according to which has most NPC killed activity and then steal the tags. because no ratting system would be without the ESS. 
---
We could bubblefuck enemy ESSes. 
---
We could have logon traps on enemy ESSes. 
---
We could kill your ESS and then put up an ESS somewhere we don't want you to have a fort/astra/keepstar. Or defensively place our ESS in such a way that you can't put a fort/astra in the strategically best position. 
---
I think there's a lot of opportunity to do funny dread/carrier stuff on the ESS, both defensively and offensively. Depending on the exact figures. 
---
And also depending on how grid-fu works these days, we could make your keepstar part of the ESS grid perhaps, and then your keepstar is cynojammed because "same grid hurrdurr". And then if the ESS cynojams a radius instead of gridwide, we could do a few funny things with that radius. Like use one as a barrier between my fleet and yours in a titan brawl, or even cyno-jam your fleet entirely. Or put up stop-bubble traps from gates with an ESS cynojamming them (How quick does one online? Maybe it can be onlined in the time it takes a titan fleet to warp across a 150 AU warp in 10% tidi). 
---
Not gonna lie, I saw the title and expected a more Howard the Duck PlayDuck style mascot.
---
And you and yours can't find leadership? Have you tried asking your local grade school for advice? 
---
I'd be good money for a flame shooting purple dragon dildo avatar skin.
---
And you know I'm not the only one
---
Was the alt corp also at war with the corp who owns the fortizar?
---
Sometimes I genuinely love your posts.
---
(Don't feed the meme accounts)
---
And this is how you get no tax, but mandatory monthly fees from corps. Noone is going to bother with this.
---
As everyone else has said, make use of those wormholes! 
---
I'll also add that [EvE-Scout](http://www.eve-scout.com/) is a great resource. Back when I used to do a ton of exploration it definitely saved me a ton of time finding quick routes out to the middle of nullsec and then home again later on.
---
Why would anyone sprawl if they had the necessary numbers to maintain a proper umbrella (NCdot, TEST and goons, maybe one or two other groups)? Its an automatic bar that says "you have to be this many to dreadbomb or hunt our ratter and miners effectively, so if you're fewer, forget it". 
---
Only reason I'd think of that Goons would split our supers up, is in a shield region and armor region, then we could have ratting and mining in two regions at once. Preferably neighboring regions so we could reinforce each other with maybe just one mid. 
---
Those are all The Mitani’s accounts.
---
The ESS should also control the rate the anoms spawn.  Say it spawns 5 an hour for each (rank).  Get rid of the existing instant respawn mechanic too.

Pos was such a better system, everyone was so happy to bring citadles in, even though they cost more, take longer to deploy, are more vulnerable, do less damage, and can be easily reinforced with a handful of ships. 
---
Idiots, the lot of us. 
---
Thats efford. Which is fine. 
---
seems like clever use of retarded game designs
---
I mean, i shit on pirat too when i started out in high-sec but wtf are they supposed to do. fight goons lol?
---
Wait so...huh?
---
Killing a ihub isnt really anything thats possible to provoke a fight with just a roaming fleet
---
&gt; 90% of what dropped did not even have time to whore
---
Can confirm, missed the killmail by 2-3 seconds, in a Nyx...
---
The main problem with outright removing the damage cap is the vastly increased cost of citadels compared to POS's, particularly the higher tiers.
---
For example, consider that the super and titan fleets alone fielded by Goons during keepstar battles, without a damage cap, could RF/kill the keepstar in &lt;30 seconds (5 minutes real time).  Structure battles, to an extent, become about winning after the structure is dead; this wasnt an issue so much with POSes due to their low cost and immunity to the bulk of super damage.
---
And while this does counter troll structures, it basically goes too far in the opposite direction.  On the small scale,  successfully anchoring a structure near any of the large blocs becomes dependent on them not just dropping a super fleet to kill your structures in less than a minute while anchoring or onlining.
---
Personally, I think structure spam is better addressed through increased costs.  Add a small, cheap POS-like structure with limited services and no damage cap to support quick staging needs, but dramatically increase the cost of the medium and large structures, while dramatically reducing their rig costs.  Aim for structure spam to become expensive while deploying a rigged structure you actually want to keep doesn't cost much (or any)  more than now.
---
Then it better be a good alliance -- people balk at up front costs, much easier to get a percentage of profit.  If the alliance sucks then it'll be tough for them to talk very many people into paying them a flat fee.
---
And, as an added bonus, if people get pissed off at their alliance leadership they could just boycott the fees until their demands are met.
---
Also, the stuff from exploration is very low in volume, so courier contracting it to Jita from any other trade hub or route is cheep and fast.
---
Pirat trying to learn real PVP lol
---
Now you have the V0LTA stag back :)
---
Cause taking sov is so fun, especially if defenders wont fight for it. Great way to generate fights. 
---
Got to the dragon part and just laughed at myself for being pulled that deep into this story. Haha damn ya got me.
---
T1 guns ..... the embarrassment 
---
Not really anything thats limited to goons. It just sounds like fun eve stuff. 
---
Calendars?
---
In my opinion. One of the most cancerous alliances in game right now. 
---
Is it weird to not be able to do a proper squat without the bar on your shoulders? When i got that weight on my shoulders/shelf its fine but ill be god damned if I can do it without. 
---
Its not just about goons. Like wtf
---
disable doomsdays on citadels
---
make dmg cap be well...  logarithmic damage cap
---
more people on grid, the more dmg cap.   (not including people tethered)
---
encouraging people to show up to at least give it dmg cap.
---
or
---
-----
---
 if you drop a small cit/ec in a system you don't hold sov in that there should be no damage cap... that way you spam it you stand a pretty good chance of losing it. Forts, keep the damage cap... since they are pretty pricey...
---
or make it standings based/sov... so you could drop a cit in an allies sov system and it keeps damage cap unless you piss them off and they reset you... then you lose your shit...
---
if higher ADM, higher the damage cap (for defenders), and at 6.0 it's like say twice as easy to kill or sth like that
---
It will decline again after the new players find r/Eve

Eve is growing, Eve has always had a large number of alts / bots, I don't think alpha clones changed this at all tbh (I played 2008-2013, started again 2018)
---
The servers cope with 1000 titans duking it out just fine, its the 1000 supers (with 5 fighter wings each) and 1000 assorted capitals and 2000 subcaps that show up to spoil the fun. 
---
Plus I actually didn't lag during the X47 fights. Sure the server calls had up to about 2 minute wait times but I could turn the camera around smoothly and everything because I followed the 32-bit client New Eden rules for not crashing a client that is hard-capped at 4gb of memory use like all other 32-bit programs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/95tm0i/while\_waiting\_for\_64bit\_client\_here\_are\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/95tm0i/while_waiting_for_64bit_client_here_are_some/) And for a titan+fax pilot having the odd 2 minute wait for firing just meant I could savor the moment I had been waiting for, for so long.

&gt;Are sleepers affected by wormhole type? I.E: Magnetar rats do more dps?
---
No
---
&gt;Does jump cloning remove active drugs? What about the skill point accelerator drugs?
---
Boosters are removed AFAIK, but not accelerators
---
&gt;Is the only way to get a new attribute remap to wait a year?
---
&gt;Will POS sticks always be in the game?
---
No, CCP has been working on phasing them out for years by systematically transferring all their functions over to Upwell structures. The last functionality that remains exclusive to POSes is that of a quickly anchorable forward operating base, such as the ones used during the Rage eviction. 
---
&gt;Can you set the pos to attack NPC (drifters) automatically?
---
Assuming you are still talking about wormhole drifters (Arythmos Tyrannos), they would never be on grid with a POS. They visit planetary warp-ins, not moons. Dunno about the other questions tbh. 
---
&gt;Are combat inties useful in any way or are assault frigates always better?
---
I'd say AFs are always better, unless you desperately need a little extra speed for whatever reason. 
---
&gt;How much better is the auto-target wh barghest vs the auto target raven for c5 site range-clearing? How do you not hit sleeper structures? Can you kill the drifter like that?
---
Never tried either method, but you most certainly can not kill a drifter this way - they will target and apply damage at 400km while burning towards you at 6,000m/s. 
---
&gt;What's the strongest alliance? 
---
The Imperium is widely agreed to be the strongest single coalition currently based on sheer numbers of members and supercaps. 
---
&gt;Are hard knocks closed now that they're evicted?
---
Even a cursory look at their [zkill page](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98040755/) or their [DOTLAN page](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Hard_Knocks_Inc.) can tell you that they're alive and well, and have in fact suffered almost no loss in membership, which is just incredible in and of itself. 
---
Just because we do nonconsensual PvP in game doesn't mean we have to be assholes on Reddit. 
---
When Eve had more players there were half a dozen places you could discuss/post fits, all long dead sadly. Guess when half the playerbase has been around forever and the rest get hoovered up by newbro blobs with doctrines there's not much to talk about. There is an evefittings reddit, generally dead for posts but if you ask a question it'll probably get answered. Otherwise zkill lossmails is your lot really, it's not an ideal format for browsing but some of the WTF fits can spark fun ideas so there's that. Oh, Spectre Fleet has a doctrines/fit bit on their website, it's fits designed for their blobs rather than a massively comprehensive database but most of them are at least sensible enough to plug into Pyfa and play around with.
---
As for the wiki its generally well maintained for game mechanics and stuff like that but the fits veer between fine, awful and five years out of date. Either of the previous two options would probably work out better :)
---
Now.. Now I want to join
---
I actually run test's srp, we do srp small scale home defense and quite a few fun roams as long as they aren't blatant welp fleets.
---
One 256x256 full region ($249 usd/mo maintenance fee) at median Jita isk/plex price comes out to around 23b per month.
---
It goes up on the weekends, but honestly it's still near 30,000. You can probably make a good argument for alts and bots and claim the true pay number is around 10,000.
---
That'll be another $20 at some point in the future.
---
Each race's T2 ships has its own racial resist profile, usually to match the common damage type of their opposing faction
---
Can stop your brain if you never had one to begin with.
---
So it's not mid fight; they have to dock up to change corps. Also, goons could've and should've wardeccer all the corps who wardeccer their fort corp.

Just wondering... what happened to LUMPY?

"The difference is I just want to have fun"

Welcome to eve. People hate losing ships in Eve and almost everyone will try one up each other to get an advantage and then call each other out for being risk averse. 
---
You will get the occasional good fight and that’s the only reason many people and myself still play this game.
---
If anyone here buys a $60 skin and helps CCP perpetuate their current mindset of just making money grab skins and not fixing the game, you're a fucking window licker. 
---
Welcome to Life and other people having different definitions of what is fun. But seriously, this is just a fact of games in general; some people like just playing the game and others only enjoy the game if they win. I have seen it in video games, board games, cards games... shit anytime there is a 'winning' condition that is all some people will care about.  
---
Learn a lesson and move on.
---
&gt; EVE DownUnder here I come
---
  Oh don't worry I'll remember this
---
EVE is horribly balanced for 1v1 (Well, horribly balanced for anything really).  Very few people want to sit through the stupid PVE for a chance roll the dice and get potentially hard countered, with no means to avoid an unwinnable matchup.  
---
The ability to avoid fights/disengage/split targets is the only thing that makes solo PVP in EVE remotely viable, and that is completely removed in abyssmal shitspace.
---
That's a lot of supers and titans on that killmail.
---
I think they way they are is a purposeful limitation.
---
Flashback to playing that game underaged and trying to think of how I could afford a region as a preteen. 
---
&gt;Right, and you're gonna further favor bots over humans with those changes.
---
Explain
---
For those of you who're in nullsec mining in fleets with Rorquals or Orcas boosters, how do you manage the ore and the profits? Do you all just mine for yourselves or give it to someone to compress / refine and sell back to corp or something? 
---
You made one mistake- nelieving CCP care about this stuff...
---
Nah. You don't need to kill for content. I'm a firm believer that setting up an area of denial is gameplay.
---
Que bola! Acere!
---
Welcome to the Eve community, friend.
---
What was the way people made Isk back in the day lets say 10 years ago? was it still just ratting/mining/missions?
---
Yeah it would be super irritating to be in a several billion ISK Gila and get your drones shot off by some yahoo in a Caracal, then both die because the Caracal can't break the Gila itself (I've heard of stranger things happening in the abyss).
---
If I were to reinvent abyssal pvp, I'd want to make loss not cost the ship to encourage people to play and have fun. If you win you get more loot, if you don't you at least get to keep what you have. There's no reason that instanced PvP needs to be as viciously unforgiving as the rest of the game.

we were still staging in the pos at the time of the fight but you are right... the raitarus should have been up... the fort was indeed delayed because of complications so we decided to pick one of the raits as staging right after the 2nd reff so we can move some stuff in and have a good amount of ppl in the staging cit
---
so we had raits up but didnt use them yet which doesnt matter anyway since we would still be limited to stukas and ravens
---
Last time I did it I had to copy 10 at a time, wouldn't let me copy more than that.
---
You can take look at [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) and switch to the 1 year view.  Doesn't look like there is any significant movement in growth or decline.    You will see a dip from July to September which is a normal pattern for Eve as people enjoy the warmer weather in the northern hemisphere.  
---
For a MMO to survive it needs to have healthy balance between releasing flashy content that (re-) attracts new players (like the Abyss) and quality of life stuff (bug fixes, balancing, performance/stability improvements, etc) to keep the vets happy.
---
CCP knows this and there's is no way they will ever allow the CSM to mess with this balance.
---
&lt;3 Cuba, from Canada
---
You're right I guess. 
---
Snuff lived in Raka before BRM existed. Snuff lived in Raka before citadels were even announced. So idk how that's possible.
---
Skill inject an alt into a curse and cloak it in the site duh
---
It sure looks like it. Start with a conclusion, deny all rebuttals while scrambling for evidence that supports the conclusion. Just like Steven Crowder.
---
You should get more fulfilment in your life. Have you considered getting a dog?
---
US time it hovers around 16k to 24k prime time depending on the day.
---
I feel like I am running into total first account noobs a lot more regularly.  Especially in my WH 
---
You act like goons are the only ones who know how have fun in this game. Regardless, go ahead and name off a few ways this change would allow fun exclusively to goons and no one else.
---
Looks like you misspelled dickgirl dumb degenerate
---
As long as the CSM is a joke of a representation of the actual player base it cannot be taken seriously.
---
I have a pet oh wise advice of the internet giver 
---
I did. I just find it a disgusting and shameful tactic. Embarrassing really to have to do that. My ship wasn't worth much more than the bait ship. Some scrub just wanted to pad his killboard. 
---
So you think someone shouldn't have something, you don't want to put in the effort to take it from them, you just want it taken away from them?
---
No reason we can’t have an ESS rework and have local changed to the same delay as unknown space. I do chuckle at those who are freaking out about the idea of local going that route. Makes you wonder why they are so unhinged about it.
---
Cuz then people will farm assloads of free T5 assbyssmal loot without any effort.
---
"now" they do.
---
It was only 10 Rorqs that I lost dammit 
---
Cos t2 amarr resists have high explo/kin natural but low em/therm
---
Just be thankful you don't need to copy or buy a ton of warp to zero bookmarks.
---
They have that already. It's called a keepstar doomsday. I've got the kill mail if you don't believe me :)
---
Back when they existed the dumb 10 bookmarks at a time limit did not exist.
---
You mean if we unsub, we can help eve die faster?
---
Yay!
---
Trying to think of how one could afford one as an adult. How the fuck is it worth it? Maybe it's just because I know modern server hardware could do it way cheap.
---
Or the "This is EVE" Trailer - you HAVE to be hooked by those
---
Fucked if I know, but back then the price was closer to five times as much if memory serves. Though I do recall there being different tiers of regions based on object count. 
---
And I going to have to go up on stage again and tell the story?
---
Yup, lot of work into something that didn't go anywhere. Had to make a ship that would get thru the rats first and then pvp. The higher the tier the more the fits narrowed down that people were using.
---
All.bots according to reddit
---
No I'm sure everyone knows now
---
There is a seasonal flow to the numbers of people online.  It dips in the summer and comes back during the winter.  Right now we are on the up swing until about April when it will dip again. If you take the overall trend, the numbers are slowly going down as people age out and fewer new players replace them.  
---
Km? No km at all... which is kinda sad considering he is camping 0-24/7 with 60+ toons. I mean we all have goals in this game i guess. Someone wants a titan, someone gets into indy and someone wants to be a scarecrow. Who am i to judge...
---
I mean, they're both completely defenseless, if value is equal there isn't much difference.
---
Am I still banned?
---
The activity tracker is going to show CCP what people do in game, for the first time in 15 years. Any day now we'll get useful content.
---
I believe they do want NS to be unsafe and dangerous. More than anything, the effects that were to come from how Goons for example managed to organize themselves, was an oversight of CCP and something they probably hadn't anticipated.
---
You say shameful they see another check in the win column. Just because someone plays the game different than you doesn't mean they are disgusting loathsome people.
---
Just because you sprang the hunters trap doesn't mean he was specifically looking to kill noobs in cheap t1 builds.
---
They are. But NS is close second.
---
Wtf is a stucka
---
No need for delay if you can just remove showing who's in the system in local. The same way it works in WH space.
---
I'm sure they're being pinged by the hour.       
---
"Please join"     
---
"Look at how much fun we're having"     
---
"Look at this dread you could have dropped on"
---
There still are. A homestead is more affordable but has a fraction of the prim limit a full region has.
---
Eve is the least fair game ever made, the whole point of the game is to win by making the game as unfair as possible...
---
Whatever you need to tell yourself. 
---
You are posting about some guy using a bait alt to pvp your ship for his automatic win on a pvp ~~focused~~ infested subreddit. These kids don't care about fun, they care about their killboard. They know nothing else. 
---
Extremely unlikely a caracal can survive a competently piloted pimp out Gila in abyssal arena. 
---
what are you even on about, you were the one complaining about it lmao
---
Don't pretend horde is great, however good you think you have it, it could be way better if your leader was less of a butt to other leaders (even allies) and his own members. 
---
Perhaps a bad example, but I've heard of expensive things getting countered by cheap things, nobody able to break the other, then they both die.
---
This feels like a "fix" that won't affect the big alliances, but will cripple line members of small alliances and drive them to the large alliances.
---
Is that the fix we want?
---
Monkies
---
All the most fashionable people were there.  Naturally crowds gather.
---
Love it.
---
....nothing? 
---
I think you misunderstood my comment. I wasn't challenging the dueling mechanic at all.
---
insulting conversation using direct slurs, this is dumb can be insulting, so can are you high? or even a come on think about it man. 
---
Because likely me you have nothing better to do right now and it's a fun waste of time. 
---
Because you believe you have such strong arguments despite knowing there false that you believe you can convince any critic of something you fully aware is false ( that would include both pompous and arrogant ), as well as being really silly because honestly, I'm unlikely to be important enough to really matter in any CSM bit. 
---
None of those include because you care about the position your holding or even the position being something you believe factually accurate (keep in mind I hold none of these as truth but you ask me to give you motivation with those aspects being truth ).
---
also "you guys" kinda doesn't apply here I literally speak for nobody but myself here, so try not to assign me motivations of other people. 
---
My main objections to the csm in order of importance: 
---
Lack of transparency ( there is no real way to audit after the fact what csm members told CCP, other than some vague minutes ), that by you own admission are missing important information ( and no people talked about stuff isn't good enough ). 
---
Lack of diversity I known you hate this one but when a majority of a group comes from a particular background I'm generally skeptical if that background is not both a helping hand to getting to the position and more importantly there loyalty to set background for getting them there ( my belief is anybody elected wants to be re-elected likely plays a role here ). 
---
I do think the lack of a "balanced" CSM has some major impact in how CCP both implements and communicates changes, because as I gave the description before for me a CSM has one job and that protecting CCP from making dumb mistakes ( like capital MJDs ). 
---
The reason the second point comes up more is that there are very few people that would make the argument we get too much information from the CSM. 
---
You can't cloak in a FW site... duh. 
---
Most people just run with their regular T3 gila fits. If you can clear the site and actually survive to take the filament, you probably have a reasonable chance. If it's profitable or a good idea though, that's another story.
---
less people run alts than you think.  it's hard to remember that if you're a higher level player, but when I was on the CSM we were quoted that there was around roughly 1.5 to 1.7 subscribed accounts per human.
---
The devil is in the details. You’re overthinking this way to much with things like no cynos, reinforcement timers, spooled up bonuses... just start by fixing current problems : deny anchoring in anoms and looting with pods mainly.
---
I just want the advanced audio sliders, for active client back. I gave up an a bearable AURA years ago.
---
So they can feel okay with it and I can't feel disgusted by it? That doesn't make sense. If they have the right to do it, I have the right to an opinion of it. They don't get to have the only say. Like I said, you can call me salty, but that doesn't change that my opinion of them is shameful and disgusting. 
---
You can also make a new account through a recruit link from someone else. You will then get 500k sp 
---
Goggle it yourself. You dont seem to understand what the mbc actually was.
---
Funny enough goons did not understand it either and it turned em in the most powerfull entity in eve so there is that.
---
Heels touch ground when slavs squat around!
---
That's my point. I have a right to an opinion about it, don't I? They're just scrubs. Period. I don't care about the loss, I find it pathetic how they need to accomplish it b
---
Dude, can you tell me what those are so I can edit the post and add those, that's the point of me saying "I will edit this post as needed"
---
Looking into it
---
"Stuka" means sturzkampfbomber and translates to dive bomber
---
ingame it is a doctrine consisting of command destroyers to move around and bombers to do the bombing
---
One of the most important features in EVE, still looks like Excel from 2006
---
Heh. Try to be the guy running a bookmark business with more than a thousand per system (sometimes). I guess that’s why I pay 250k ISK for it. 
---
Most Cubans drive classic American cars from the 1950/60's and you're first assumption is UI Bots? 
---
Grow up, Jr. 
---
That titan must not have had resists on. Or any tank on really
---
This. So much this. If you know bubble mechanics in null, you are basically good to go because the assumption is anything is trying to kill you.  
---
Gate gun mechanics where you tag and leave grid and come back and don't redraw aggro? Like in what universe does that make sense? Learned lots of lessons like that the hard way.
---
It's currently at 999,999.5
---
Does that mean you'll sub and play? 
---
Ok let me rephrase, snuff was not around black rise when that fortizar was anchored. As in off fighting somewhere across the universe. 
---
When? It's 2019 now. CCP was bought out. Delve is the largest super umbrella in the game. He's running out of time. 
---
It's almost as if you had the numbers to recover from such mistakes, where HK didn't have the same ( spoiler that's likely why you won ) and also the reason people will say you won because of the numerical advantage. 
---
It's not just about the fight itself you had the pods to recover from mistakes, HK and friends lack that luxury, that means they could win but their odds of winning were relatively minor because there victory condition was flawless execution, whereas you victory condition was nowhere close to having to execute flawlessly. 
---
in which case you could easily fuck over any alliance by just reinforcing the structure during their weakest timezone.  Fighting someone primarily AUTZ?  better shoot that shit in USTZ so the defenders can't ever hope to fight back.
---
More 3rd party tools?! Awesome!!! CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE BANK off of coding them for everyone else. 
---
You mean like Renters in California. 2019. 
---
Wanna play Sea of Theives?
---
Then wouldn’t it be easier to modify them, instead of reworking the ESS into what’s basically a secondary ihub?
---
hARdcOrE GamINg
---
I miss my Nyx
---
No lol i joined dix a bit before we left BL but i just burned out finally and quit about the same time as the rest of the corp
---
It's sad you still haven't figured it out yet.  
---
Isaac didn't wait for Don to get on the pod!
---
you can't build supercapitals without sov, for starters.
---
you also can't build much of an empire if you don't own any territory.
---
&gt;Stop making insults that don't make sense first?
---
Yeah maybe. Im no developer though :p
---
In what realm of humanity and time do weebs live fulfilled and happy lives? The answer is none and this should be squashed and churned into something productive and society-helping.
---
yeah i feel you brother, there just aint really much you can do besides laugh at how pathetic they are. theres this one loser from pen is out that sits on frigate plexes in his vanguard and then boasts about how elite he is in local xD
---
&gt;  I don't think alpha clones changed this at all tbh
---
that's nuts. Once free alphas and SP farms became a thing, there have been thousands of new accounts. And that's just one guy. 
---
I've heard too many bookmarks contribute to lag. 
---
There's always going to be a lack of transparency, because much of what we do is behind the scenes. But there's plenty that is transparent and plenty that is public that you can judge if you want to.  I mean, is there anybody more visible than me on this CSM? 
---
The way that the election system works favors the most organized people in the game, and those are all found in null sec. But there are plenty of folks on it that have different things in their background, even if most come from null now. But that's a criticism of the CSM as an institution, not of me personally. 
---
I think this CSM has done a pretty good job, but obviously that opinion isn't universal.
---
aaaaaa si loco  que bola acere    ñooooo me  llego eso  chamaco ahahahah  
---
I believe you do not need to login all your SP farm chars.
---
hahahahahaha hahahaha  
---
yeah like this one [https://ibb.co/HqhZDsW](https://ibb.co/HqhZDsW)
---
Reverse doxxing, telling the real world about our in game persona.
---
dang why you so mad??? like....go back to suck on your master toes....
---
Its not like the members of the alliances that can't rat or mine with capitals, could afford to buy or build supers or titans anyway. So I guess the leaders need something to spend the isk they take from the taxes of their members VNI ratting and buyback program. 
---
?????????????
---
he meant a d-scan cloak
---
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works...
---
Well, in Eve that is a valid tactic. My guess is, the fleet was not there just to bait you. They probably looking to kill faction frigates. You can always try to burn away to break tackle. Lesson of the story, don't always assume FW plex is a 1v1 arena; watch your dscan.
---
Okay, so here are a few points.
---
1- No, EVE doesn't need more timers, the game is already full of timer cancer mechanics.
---
2- It's more than time for people to stop being so highly retarded. Stop trying to ruin PvE for the sake of PvP. A VNI ratting in it's anom is not content, if it is content to you, you need to rethink about what PvP is. I mean, sure, one VNI from time to time might be fun, but it's not content, stop with this bullcrap.
---
If you want real content, either go roaming and wait for people to notice you, I'm sure you will get a fight out of it, but of course you need to be willing to risk your ship for that, and since people only hunt VNIs cause it's low risk of loosing your ship, we end with situations like that, retards asking CCP to murder PvE cause "Hurr Durr Durr I Can't get Muh VnI ConTNt."
---
/u/WallymartsEve
---
But thats exactly what im arguing the whole time... Numbers on the outside of the wormhole would be useless obviously (spiler thats why they lost)
---
They had few less at the time of the deciding fight and were in the right setup to get it done. A lack of experience fighting stukas got them killed. With success they would have gained the numbers advantage (a lot of wormholes were just waiting to get in and 300 hordelings were 5jumps out already) but since they failed it went the other way.
---
Yet they try make them look all great claiming they expected 1500 dudes holding hole control but in some heroic act undocked AGAINST ALL ODDS!! 
---
VNIs would stop being used everywhere in null
---
still not seeing where this makes goons worse off than the average nullsec alliance
---
I see you didn’t answer my question.
---
How do I delete someone else's post? 
---
Ooof.   Damn son.  Probably had no idea what they were doing. 
---
Maybe. Maybe not. Some will adapt and maybe use ships that can tank?
---
Wont be worse off than others in regards to supcap farming. Probably the same in terms of cap ships ratting, 
---
Target Jita, single reactor ignition
---
It feels like you just read the title and not even the beginning where i already talked about hunting ratters being boring. You can check my KB, i very rarely kill ratters because its not content. But neither is roaming nullsec through a bunch of systems where everyone just hides in a PvP game.
---
In case you didn't notice. An ESS at 100% payout means a ratter can still just dock up and not pvp. The extra 5% tag bounty can be scooped by roamers if they so choose. If its a larger gang, they can RF the ESS and you lose bounty payout for you choosing not to defend your space. Nothing is forcing you to fight, you just get a profitability risk when you want to run 8 VNI alts in system and log them off/dock when a neut appears in local.
---
Give the guy a break willya?!
---
Even if it's 2 accounts per user subscribed, that doesn't mean that everyone always logs in all their accounts.
---
lol and it's a PH guy saying that holy shit. 
---
As I've said, player visibility to this (and the last several CSMs) has been a problem.
---
A few months ago, I remember someone telling me that CCP Guard said the CSM had to answer to the players. I replied "Guard is a smart guy but he's dead wrong about this. Most of the CSM members only have to answer to one or two players." Even mynnna on CSM8 only had to answer to one player: Mittens.
---
Funny side note: Mittens and I had a really odd relationship going for a while. He's never really liked me, but from time to time he's asked for my counsel. I suspect I rate with him roughly the same as a KGB "useful idiot." Anyway, not long before the end of CSM8's term, Mittens asked me to rate mynnna and in particular, how useful I thought mynnna had been in advocating null-sec goals to CCP. It really underlined for me how much control the null blocs have with the players that represent them on the CSM.
---
When I see the amount of bullshit in OP's post I'm glad they don't care tbh. 
---
Batllecruiser Operational
---
I still remember how i learned that lesson
