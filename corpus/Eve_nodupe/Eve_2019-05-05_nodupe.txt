Way back when citadels were first being developed they were sometimes prone to going to warp and being able to jump.
---

---
Given what we know now I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't a mobile citadel that can be jumped between systems, and docked in, but not necessarily able to go to warp and move around as part of a fleet traditionally.
---
To be used for jumping fleets on mass to the front lines and then acting as a FOB.

man eve needs an update already
---
You have to log in every day. But you can claim from character selection so you don't actually have to play the game.
---
Looks amazing
---
i wish the skin in game would look like this, not the blurry pixely mess it is now (it looks like a blown up jpg)
---
Yes from what the discorse  sed it sound like a station.
---
Imagine calling being DD'd by a keepstar a fight. Living the real high life there aren't you Ronald.
---
Did you really stream this live? And was it really sponsored by one dude to have fun? Dude, I can’t believe CVA were the real MVPs. Tell me more.
---
Until we go back to BL.  Right now the salt is very favorable here. I mean look at all the downvotes I'm harvesting from TAPI. It's incredible. TAPI FCs are literally being told to avoid Elo. It's insane.
---
You know the whole story!
---
pls just make the new command destroyer faster.
---
Please Ron, my guy, link the twitch again, I am not sure everyone has seen it yet.

You guys can shit on everything that you want, but this was the single most generous thing I've ever seen anyone do and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
---
I dont like sansha and drifters, and neither do the trigs, why cant we be friends and curbstomp drifters?
---
Yea it was pretty generous thank you.

You have to log in each day

The E-Uni WHC calls its statics 'bacon' and 'eggs', and that page is written for WHC members.

---
&gt;Smugs on reddit about "TAPI feeding to FRAT"
---
Wew lad
---
Wow he's actually an idiot
---
One system that I always enjoyed was in games like Civilization there was a -pedia that gave a general overview of each of the game systems and units. It was super helpful.
---
No local means you actually need to watch the gates, and your gate scouts need to actually be paying attention the whole time. For any kind of long term thing that means you need scouts across all TZ. That's a huge difference from the game literally telling you when someone enters or logs into your system.
---
Great story and congrats man. Quite an accomplishment.
---
and got sent home by bosonic field? sounds fun
---
Hf killing 50m vnis, already replaced in the time it took you to burn out to deep dronelands.

what are you talking about? you literally just nip'd winter coalition

This is a blobber free zone, remove urself

Pretty much any t1 frigate, but en mass

typical CCP ballance, they wait 10 years to FIX an issue, and then when they do they overpower the loving shit out of it.

Finished showering?
---
U forgot to mention that it was sponsored by 1 guy and that u streamed it
---
Actually I definitely make the game better by not having played it in almost a decade.
---
My high school didn't have lockers, my class was maybe 12 people in total? So we just had school bags.
---
Great video man. I saw Suitonia joined you guys a few days ago.. great stuff.
---
When did we plan the NIP for GOTG and PL/NC?
---
what about incursions that when you fuck up somehow, you cant warp out, and you lose the entire fleet.
---
pepega
---
actually you could always keep your sub and not train anything. then when you come back (so long as you didnt log in) you could GM ticket and get all your SP back as unallocated.  ive done this a few times to the tune of 50M unallocated SP over the years
---
pepelove
---
isn't that RMT? Using ingame tactics / mechanics and using / selling them in RL? (besides that congratz, great idea)
---
I've occasionally wondered about a partial reset, mostly of the map. Some cataclysmic event and then boom, all the systems are randomly shuffled.
---
CCP said he could choose to be anything he wanted in eve.
---
So he chose to become a god.
---
I agree with this man, maybe beat the meat while you’re at it, clear your mind.

Lmfao thanks for that

Choose something, buy 10 of them, then go lose all of them. You can have the perfect fit but it will still lose to a shitty one if you don't have practice.

all incursions. even on hisec. you kill it the poof the incursion despwans.
---
over 1 mil sp. Fuck yeah.
---
Are you new here?
---
Makes sense

&gt; what are you talking about?

About the "invasions" that you listed. Like, it's in this same string of comments.

If you want some fear of the unknown where space is dangerous and losses hurt, hop into the abyssal arena and you'll get lots of that.

That makes sense. I think a wiki or some type of info encyclopedia would work out well these days. There's even more stuff to learn than there was just a couple years ago.

Can anyone explain to a guy who has been out of the loop for a year what happened there?
---
Not sure if retarded, or...\*looks at flair\*...no, no, definitely retarded

Tldr ccp banned a CSM, it exploded in the media, realized they fucked up and their investigation was a sham, then Unbanned him.

I have a few other samples of ink, just a few ml, but I've stuck with Yama Dori. It was the ink I fell in love with through pictures that got me into buying a fountain pen.

Thanks again mate, you did a great job putting this together.
---
Tbf I shouldn't be surprised, BL/Origin never miss an opportunity to take credit for everything and make a show about patting themselves on the back for it.
---
Can confirm, dark blood nos saves lives
---
They only fight with init that is*
---
No, but you can control where they appear on the screen. Find your combat log and turn on moving mode.
---
Your answer is in his flair
---
I also like how they're downvoting people for thanking the dude that sponsored this. Some real sportsmanship for these kids.
---
Hehe im not sure if u re trolling. In case u are serious, 
---
ancil repair allows u to repair larger amount of hp when its loaded with nanite paste. 
---
Which, on the other hand, means that u can still rep little bit amount of hp without being nanite paste loaded. 
---
And reloading nanite takes 60 secs. 
---
So in many cases, u dont want to reload it in the middle of fight, but just keep running acil repair without paste. Becuz it still gives some hp. 
---
unless u think u can survive until its being reloaded again. 
---
This applies especially on frigate fights
---
Cuz their base hp is so low, 60secs  without repper means 100% death. So u want auto reload off, or u would see ur ship dying with its ancil repair slowly reloading
---
Why would anyone want to contribute when the canonical one was deleted?  Ccp should have gotten eve uni to at least migrate it or another org to do so. There are clones but all shit and no new edits.
---
Hey, it's DresDom! Haven't seen you in a while. How's life in the dumpster treating you since TRI got it's shit pushed in?

Because Capsuleers are still assholes.
---
&gt;I live in a C4 for pvp purposes 
---
&gt;keep 2 of my toons in a separate farm hole just for isk
---
where does he say he bears in a 4
---
lol good to know
---
reminds me of that star wars ship that Snoke was on
---
Pretty much any of them, from full neuts, scram and ab, to kitey with mwd and point; it's a really good t1 frig tbh.
---
Try Navy/Pirate frigs aswell, really fun to fly. The Firetail is my personal favourite, alongside the Dramiel.
---
Fly able citadel when?!
---
Before the ORE mining frigates, the logistics frigates were the favoured mining ships. Bantam, Navitas, Inquisitor, and Burst.
---
I do have a faint memory of using a mining Imicus in my first days though.
---
it was for the memes to be honest, we were laughing as we were SD
---
Ha. I had my titan for less than a month. And I lost it on a bait freeport. Oh well. Its all in good fun.
---
Exactly. "Mobile" battletowers that don't actually move.
---
Fucking hell you're giving me flashbacks
---
So what's your solution?
---
grr goons
---
Stainguy, Stainguy, Stainguy!!!  now we just wait
---
I don’t have a solution and that’s not the point.
---
Thanks.
---
I'd originally bought a Dark Blood Small for its extra range, but I've just checked out a recommendation from here and the Dark Blood Medium fits no problem, so I'm going to roll with that for a bit and see how it goes, and its Optimal &amp; Falloff actually look useful.
---
Hopefully, I won't need to use it much though, as I'd love to go back to the drone mod.
---
What they’re doing isn’t effective
---
And before Logi frigs it was beeline to a Thorax before training into an Apoc due to number of turret hardpoints. Good ol days.
---
Don't let the fact someone has done it already stop you, maybe you can do it better.
---
Hell, make a better zkill, that site sucks
---
The Medium fits, so thank you!
---
I'll give it a whirl for a while, and see how it does.
---
It was a nice feed hard to ignore
---
Guys (and maybe girls), most of you seem to not understand what op meant here. This is the important part:
---
&gt; Basic mechanics like missiles and turrets shouldn't require you read a 6 page article.
---
This. Yes you can find everything about missiles and turrets on the internet, but the problem is that you find EVERYTHING. Not the important bits. This is why EVE Uni wiki, as great source of info as it is, might not be always the best answer to a knowledge-hungry newbie. It's simply too much information about a particular item or concept.
---
In other game I was playing (Wurm Online) there is/was a wiki with two versions of the same page: one, detailed, for an external browser, another, short, for an ingame help embedded in the game interface.
---
Correct, but as far as I could tell, using faction/storyline/officer weapons won't give you the specialization skill bonuses.
---
Link to the lore?  I always wanted to get into the lore but never really knew where to start.  I read all the books, and part of the huge hardcover.  Any suggestions?
---
Big enough to make a bridge from stain
---
Apoc rather, the third T1 Battleships weren't around in the early days. Caldari only had the Raven and Scorp.
---
&gt;Players quit because eve is a very simple game
---
lol no.
---
That is actually kinda terrifying.  I love it.
---
Makes sense. Titans are very unwieldy as they are. A Xordazh must be even worse in that regard, seeing they're much bigger.
---
I went back over the video - it's the new Navitas hull, which came out _way_ later. 
---
Guess you're right.
---
I do "crisis management" for a tech company.  When the platform has a problem, I'm one of the people that runs the call and drives the problem to completion.
---
EVE FCs taught me how to be calm under pressure, figure out what to ignore and what not to ignore, and how to speak with authority.  I've literally improved at my job because of EVE.
---
I've actually had people DM me in the middle of a crisis and ask "Hey do you play EVE?  You sound like an FC."
---
But I've never had the balls to FC in Eve.
---
But I thought PH condones botting?
---
For me, it was always the hulk. Ever since I was first mining in a Velator, and saw a Hulk fly by. So massive, so potent. Love at first sight.
---
Of course, by the time I got a Hulk, things had changed and the Mackinaw suited me best.
---
Nonetheless, I still have a fully fit Hulk called First Aspiration that sits in a hangar.
---
Twice the player count would be cool, but when most other MMOs have shut down and even WoW is struggling to retain players I question just how much CCP is to blame.
---
I believe that's a Goon renter corp.
---
You're supposed to quietly forget that accusation since it turned out to be unfounded. Goons are now the target of the 5 minute hate. Good thing we're used to that. Grrr PLA.
---
... being in it to win it.
---
Would be nice if the bloody hand skin looked this crisp in game and didnt look like its texture was made in paint.
---
The fleet cane and muninn is super blurry/smudgey. Not sure if it looks like that on the niddy too.
---
Killboard says null sec uwu
---
You obviously didn't read my edit where I apologized. That's okay, there is plenty of hate going around.
---
It does definitively translate into PC gaming.  
---
league of legends
---
dota
---
path of exile
---
fortnite
---
wow
---
All do micro/macro transactions and bring in a far higher $ per 'spender' than the average eve player.  Those games make tremendously more money and with wow as the exception have no problem supporting dozens to hundreds of free users to each paying user.
---
Sounds like a high sec Corp too me.
---
Account time spent, PC time spent or human time spent? These are 3 separate things which depend on amount of accounts and AFKability of your ship. Having 5 VNIs probably can compete with other income sources known as average, while being very casual and needing very little human time.
---
Are you fucking stupid?
---
We roam null and low sec out of our wormhole and a lot of us join in Spectre Fleets, when we have a good connection. And you'll also notice wormhole kills on the KB.
---
That's how wormholes work.
---
Sansha incursions don't turn the gates off. These probably will. I bet it will be different
---
I don’t know man. Your tag says Pandemic Horde. Doesn’t sound very wormholey too me
---
With those odds, mise well have an additional requirement of being built within 100km from a low-sec gate leading into Stain.
---
I think you meant to say the five year hate.  Goons been getting hate since pretty much forever.  it's like a warm blanket we all wear now.
---
“Content”
---
That too.
---
I know what my tag says, just haven't been bothered changing it.
---
I'm going to catch flak for this but I think Eve is pretty well balanced.  There are pros and cons to every ship and every player has the opportunity to play off these pros/cons.  If you're knowledgeable enough, you can figure out how to counter every ship and doctrine.  Sure, there are outside factors like numbers in a fleet, timing, being in good position, etc that heavily impact gameplay. But the fact is, there is no one size fits all and no clear winner across the spectrum. Ask what everyone's favorite ship is and you'll see just how much variety we have.
---
Sure
---
I do seem to recall the Osprey having some play in early EVE mining. Hulks didn't exist in the time frame of OP's book though, sadly. My early game industrial career would have taken a much different route than Amarr Battleships.
---
I also watch Jebi's stream sometimes....
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pnn778/eve-64-bit-and-directx-12
---
Ah cool!  I didn't know that.  I started in 06, and I didn't play for the first year or so I was sub'd because...  Let's just say my OCD required me to get all the learning skills, and advanced learning skills, to 5 before I could start playing.  So I played skill queue online for a while.
---
Yeah, Osprey was _The_ Mining Cruiser.
---
Just remember that daring to do something like, I don't know, blow up these bots is goonfucking and you will be kicked ok
---
Are T1 ships viable for finding content outside of FW plexes? Are there any T1 subcaps that can solo roam or hunt?
---
i'm thinking they will destabilize stars (they have been studying them according to the emails), thus disabling jump networks (which according to the lore "focus" on binary star sets). This will leave us needing to get to the "HQ" to kill the ark, responsible for this mess - but with no gates.
---
How do we get there? Conduits. I'm betting there's gonna be fleet sized conduits with really hard content to "fight into" the HQ, and a massive reward for destroying the HQ (trig t2 bps? officer stuff?)
---
Good lord, botting in goons?!?
---
Let's hope the leadership acts in this at once! Or, whenever.
---

&gt; GOTG is on Imperium side
---
That's horde and BL's stupid fault. Don't blame GotG for being betrayed by horde.
---
Nice Star Wars rip off...
---
Although I personally hate the current Star Wars franchise.
---
Like a clingy ex. No wonder you took a break.
---
Unsure due to inconcistent time for the forseeable future. At least till I get the hang of piloting again, probably pve content. I will check out the New Eden Report. And also found some other links in this theead. Ty for info
---
Man, I'm sad we missed this. I was sitting in the hole watching the timers too. Unfortunately, we got held up and camped in nullsec. Watched the fight, looked fun as hell.
---
&gt;siigari
---
&gt;talking about new corp
---
Pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't just a link to the newest of your newbro scams, sweetie :)
---
Hmm OK. Then why does Canada, the US, Australia, all of the countries in the UK, New Zealand, all of the Caribbean countries with English as their primary language, and all of the South American countries with English as their primary language all follow the same system?
---
You can only be wrong if one system is superior to the other, EG metric vs imperial. Swapping the meaning of , and . in number formatting makes no difference except to cause confusion.
---
Not even the Triglavians can build a super big enough to drive to momma to the agricultural world.
---
Was on Sisi when they where first in testing. You could fly around in Forts and Keeps and it was glorious and hilarious
---
Thank you :D
---
You missed that time my friend. 
---
Warping Citadels on was a thing in the initial release of them to Sisi.
---
Yes. There are many T1 ships that are great for small gang of fleet doctrines. You can also take some out to NS and look for fights, particularly in areas such as Brave's or Horde's staging. You can use them to roam LS in general, and with the exception of bombers, suicide ganking is done with T1 ships. You can even use the T1 explorers (except the probe) to hunt other explorers and explorer hunters. They are generally less powerful or specialized then their T2  and faction counterparts, but they definitely have more PvP uses then just faction warfare.
---
Or, hear me out here, Rookie Help and Corp chat.
---
Thats exactly how TEST started in Delve when they began, they wanted to be away from goons but were looking at the map wrong and ended up on their doorstep.
---
TAPI HATE GREAT BATE
---
So you expect the Chinese folks in PLA to read this subreddit and your posts specifically?
---
Can any perform solo though? I don’t have the most experience, but every time I’ve gone out, it’s ended with assault frigates or bubbles.
---
fun stuff is, the narrative "look we are 2 k alliance fighting 50k coalition" is running since waaaaay before the X47 fight, so your damage control about "oh look NCPL is dying so we are really fighting outnumber now" means nothing.
---
That have been said, I love how you do not even denied YOU (The North) is the biggest blue donut in eve, yes YOU guys did outnumber us because YOU bluedonut half of eve (in fact, anyone that is not Imperial Legacy) 
---
Yes, Imperium is richer than NCPL I'll let you check history to know why a coalition almost dead 3 years ago is richer than the leet pvp group that is NCPL who keep using the top notch income eve have to offer (renter empire, casino money, Perimeter trade hub), to give you an hint, it's a lot of "MER means nothing we are still the best, look how dumb they are doing PVE"
---
&gt;Please check this http://coalitionsin.space/
---
&gt;Tapirium (with affiliates) = 55.56% of eve, so it doesn't exist bigger than Tapirium in Eve my dude.
---
That's raw numbers not player numbers, should I link my X47 link where your "smaller" coalition pull more number or you did get it ? Let's assume you get it you did outnumber us (and yes you lost because of our titan superiority but that's not the topic here) the reason why on paper we could field 50k but in reality we field less than 2 k is simple, The Imperium do not have a no pve policy like NCPL have, you have 20 rorq alt and some you don't use ? Doesn't matter bring them in, you are afk for 2 years but your corp is not on shit list ? Doesn't matter stay here, you can see the same effect with PH, my "spai" alt is still in PH after multiple month of afk which can explain why PH do not field 12 k player (my god did I really had to explain this ?)
---
&gt;Good luck to find an opponent and have fun.
---
I mean, even when we were almost dead, had no space, no money, ally almost dead, rare were the occasion NCPL came in delve shooting some bees, after the D-W beacon all we heard from them were time to time bombers fleet, ok, I admit, once we deploy somewhere you guys love roam all over delve and pretend you are killing something by spamming reddit with pve carebears who never open jabber killmail.
---
Technically Goons destroyed BoB.
---
tbh NCPL farm them for a pretty long time, I remember seeing PL hunting GOTG ratting supers during WWB while GOTG were forming to defend structure in hakonen
---
That's one thing about early EVE I don't miss one bit.
---
aww hel! Very nice
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99003549/
---
If at least it was in goons or PLA itself, nope, it end up where bot live : Renter space, the flag to who it belong doesn't matter, a bot is only looking for free ratting space.
---
That have been said, if you think any renter landlord is going to background check any member their renter corp accept, well...
---
Good choices, and congrats! That's a big step and one of the funnest!
---
CCP fucked up the overview camera setup they use for AT tourney's so badly that this is the only way to film it. Cant even do a live stream.
---
no less than twelve
---
No significance to plagiarism and unoriginality, sure. It only decides whether this is a neat video or not, in my opinion. Sounds like it's closer to *other people's* neat videos, stolen without attribution.
---
I was going to give you an actual response with some level of effort put into it, just for the sake of reminding you that you're wrong. But reading what you just typed gave me a stroke and I don't feel so generous now.
---
Which well known bots were in Goonswarm Federation and stayed protected by the leadership ? I can't think of any name (btw, free tips before you take the bait, this anette1/2/3 guy is living in a renter corp in Period Basis)
---
Do you really need three accounts? IMO it's a really cheesy way to play the game. It's an MMO. You're supposed to make friends, not MAKE friends.
---
Shhh you're ruining his narrative.
---
lol
---
None. There's no bots in goons. 
---
Nope. Not ever.
---
Trust me.
---
Join me in The Satanic Temple we already do. (FYI we dont but the media doesnt care about that.)

Just 9$ on amazon!

those are all false statements
---
&gt; So you expect the Chinese folks in PLA to read this subreddit and your posts specifically?
---
Where the fuck was that said? Is it possible that OP was posting something so the general public could be aware of it? Wait no, if you so much as mention any group by name, you are ABSOLUTELY aiming your post at them.
---

---
Again, you are welcome for content. 50 SNUFF had fun fighting 50 Tri while 130 Init were fighting 60 PL.
---
Would be much better if no one would batphone anyone, but that is impossible - some alliances are larger, some smaller, some just too wrapped up in their own meta-game. 
---
Good fight.
---
Centrally, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4YNsBS2Qw) vid for example. It can take some work, but you can make most ships work as long as you are skilled enough piloting them. You are making up the weakness of the ship with player skill though.
---
There are still people in 2019 who don't understand fluid standings or neutrals working together against a common enemy inbetween fighting each other. I guess they either never been outside of a coalition in a "it's us or them" style, or just stack back in like 2014 or something.
---
25,098 - assuming only the top is painted
---
To figure that out we would need to know 2 things: The surface area of a Hel and the percentage of that surface area covered in blood. It is possible to get these values using a 3D model of a Hel however it would be very difficult and not very precise.
---
I still have a mining-equipped Navitas from 2008 sitting in a bay in Ourselart. Back when I was young, naive, and thought I could build up a one-man industrial empire.
---
Idk ask my wife, it looks like one of her tampons.. Pretty sure she could give you accurate numbers.
---
Mining Apocs and Megathrons everywhere.
---
To be fair, that’s basically the lore...
---
Id think a lot more then 12.. lol i mean it says its 4028m long.. and about half of that is blood..  Each human could cover an area of 60m2  and if the ship was 1000m wide and by the picture might be a little bit more then that.. so 2000x1000  2m m2 would be 33,333 humans.. thats a lot of bodies...
---
Depends how many coats you do. 
---
How much semen would you need for the other half?
---
Please post calculations, general has a vested interest in this. ty xD
---
Ah the good old days. Back before they took away the low-sec gate to Stain and made us all swear to never speak of it to those who came after.
---
Seriously though, two words: jetcan mining.
---
Carry drones.
---
4,028m long
---
Assuming bottom is 1/10 the length = 403m
---
And Two tent sides = 233m each
---
Then surface area = 3.5mil m^2
---
Experience and a quick literature review tells me that 5microliters of blood is about right for 1cm^2 microscope slide which converts to a spreading rate of 20m^2 per liter (typical paints spread at a rate of 8-14m^2 per liter). 
---
The skin looks about 50% blood red, but let’s assume two coats are required based on above. 
---
That means 175,000 liters of blood, at 5.5 liters per adult earth human (I presume a close approximation of Amarrian citizens blood volume, the most appropriate source of blood for a minmatar supercarrier skin). Complete exsanguination isn’t practical without contaminating our paint with other tissues, so let’s assume 90% drainage with minimal effort. 
---
= 35,353 adult Amarrians for one paint job
---
Semen is a semi-renewable resource, you can only drain the blood from an average adult human once...
---
I told some dude that running 4 mining accounts to pay for his mission running fits that I was glad he was having fun. They don't want help. They're winning Eve.
---
Just give it time, he’s twisting and turning in his sleep. Anytime now, he will wake up all sweaty from his uneasy sleep, with his morning wood and he will feel like he has been summoned.
---
The red cross would have a difference with you there: the trick is that you don't take it all at once.
---
But that's not the question. How many loads does it take?
---

Racial skills ignored - what is the best solo "safe" ship for general exploration and randomness? Null/Low/WH, whichever. Just trying to figure something out to explore a bit and feel safer. I assume something with  cloak but I want something that can defend itself sometime.
---
And with the ship, what are ideal fits for it? I've only focused on indy, never much else so I really dunno.
---
Fleets of 60 guardians.

Outrep any fuckup and the drone ball is your dps.

Lfg trig inc, logi v, item level meta 5+. Pst.

Thank you! I drew it on my computer with a drawing tablet while eyeballing a reference; there are quite a few inaccuracies but overall it turned out good! The watercolor effects are thanks to a nice (lifesaving) tool in the drawing program I use.
---
Broadcast is up, align with your prop off.
---
We actually attempted to calculate this. Credit goes to supreme rage from brand newbros for these calculations:  
---
Estimated surface area of avatar: 300km\^2 (Estimated as a cone 13kmx5km) 1L of "paint" covers \~10m\^2 according to previous calculations. 1 US tsp = \~5 mL 
---
That gives us \~203 orgasms per 1 L assuming 1tsp per orgasm.  
---
300km\^2 in M\^2 is 300000000M\^2  We would need 3e+8 / 10 liters = 3e+7 (30000000L) of "paint" to paint the avatar. 
---
That gives us a requirement of 3e+7 \* 203 ejaculations to fully paint the avatar 
---
That is a result of 6090000000 loads blown.  
---
If we assume 1 load per day per person, it would take 1 person 16684931 and a half years to complete this paintjob.
---
Would be a QoL improvement for small groups. Or renters.
---
Rifter.
---
Because it's the best looking t1 empire frigate in eve.
---
How many coats though? I mean its assumed there would be at least 2 right?
---
It's ccp's job to deal with bots, not the players.
---
Depends, if it's obese neckbeards then really just three.
---
Capitalist Army is recruiting

Be nice if CCP did their job once in a while

Can I ask WTF is this???

/u/CCP_Falcon can we get one of the devs to give us the accurate surface area of the Hel and the Avatar please? :D
---
That's all I want too.  Can't even find them in FW space anymore. :(

Context: Provi dropped an attempt at a B-52 on the Templis freeport fort in 9UY, it died horribly along with 50b of its friends: https://fleetcom.space/battlereport/Yjsa72KbBAte6weEa

You can ask, but we don't know either v0v
---
Beautiful... The most bad ass looking carrier!
---
you can donate roughly 10% of your blood at a time then wait 10-12 weeks for the next donation.
---
so if you had a "farm" of 353,530 adults you could paint a new hull every ten weeks.
---
But Mom..........., I am too lazy to Google help and I have no initiative or will power to go look for it (or learn it).
---
Please stay out of my Eve
---
Glad to see the person who has Xander Vaude is still active, disappointed to see the original guy quit but as least the character continues to do good things.
---
Nice meme.
---
About three fiddy.

Appreciate you guys were laughing at it as much as we were, NSH coms got a good giggle out of it.

By the looks of it, cap stable.

Astero. Covops cloak, and plenty of low and mid slots for tank, dualprop, and defensive scram.
---
The fits vary wildly, but I'll post mine and why I use it instead of some of the others.
---
[Astero, explorer]
---
Damage Control II
---
Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II
---
Coreli A-Type Small Armor Repairer
---

Hobgoblin II x10

Sisters Core Scanner Probe x16
---
While it does have a scram, tank, and dps, the primary purpose of it is to run, not fight. You can catch other t1/t2 explorers, or just complete shitfit asteros (which are extremely common), but the real reasoning behind the scram is that most hunters don't fit an AB or long point. They also usually carry only 1 web, or none at all. So, if you put your scram on them, heat AB and align out, odds are they won't be able to kill you before you've burned out of scram range and warped. The tank is just there so that you don't die before you manage to escape. 
---
You'll see some fits that go for max align time at all costs. Never understood these, instawarp doesn't matter with covops cloak, that one tick in which you warp faster is not going to matter if the only time you're in danger is when you're in a bubble or locked up while you were not paying attention. Max stab fits will cut down your ticks a ton b/c of the lock range/speed reduction, and most hunters have at least 3 points of scram, while some carry 5. Plus there's dictors, in which case warp strength doesn't matter.
---
You can’t just post that “meme” alongside a relatively normal fit, it doesn’t make sense.
---
Didn’t realise TRI was such a threat to Snuff
---
You guys went there for PVP and to farm them, and then blob the shit out of them on a majority of timers calling daddy init (not imperium by the way). How does that make sense?
---
https://puu.sh/Do0gK/8d3e433d4e.png
---
Does seem kinda iffy
---
I like how provi is unable to remove a single hostile citadel from the middle of their own space after the... what, how many months it's been there? I guess the dread fit linked in this thread might explain it if that's typical of the caliber of pilot and organizational skill involved - I don't have any characters that can fly caps and even I know not to fit a dread that way!
---
Cute bee y u so cute
---
Em, I think your info is wrong. Goons have made it abundantly clear that they do not condone bots, and they also hate Chinese people so...
---
&gt;But I feel expecting not to pay more than 30$ a month for a game is beyond reasonable.
---
You have 4 different accounts in a subscription video game. This exception is moronic. Learn how to make ISK or don't cry about having to pay.
---
You could use a similar reply for pretty much everything posted on this sub, my guy. You seem extra mad though )
---
Wow, there is some humans pre-Eve gate lore in there. I didn't know there was really any of that ever written.
---
So roughly the crew of 12 destroyed Titans assuming you didn't butcher the survivors.
---
Thought you were going to say RMT
---
The ones that are getting mad at you are most likely predatory highsec tax corporations that are designed to do nothing but capture gullible new players and leech off their taxes for personal gain. 
---
The more established corporations and alliances are a lot friendlier.
---
Snuff would be cool if they were actually the underdog, but the last 6mo-year they have just been blob masters. So many good pilots and FCs in there too (
---
Nice AAR my dude, WH evictions / fights are the best.
---
I mean, you fed 34b...who cares if they’re on most the killmails. The correct comment would be “yeah we are hilariously bad and fed HARD, but not really to you, you ‘orrible Fratboys.
---
So much damage control ITT, for a “fun” alliance, TEST really can’t take losing.
---
Yes, mostly dregs of siciety  .
---
... right ...
---
Dimensions of the top are roughly 4,000m x 800m, or 3,200,000 square meters.  I estimated that 40% is painted, or 1,280,000 square meters.  
---
A human has 5.5 quarts of blood - and a quart of paint covers approximately 100 square feet, so one human covers 550 square feet. 
---
550 square feet is approximately 51 square meters.  
---
1,280,000 square meters divided by 51 is 28,098. 
---
I can't remember if the sides and bottom are painted in blood too, so might take a few more people.  I'd get 100k for extra coats and such.
---
One add to this. You don't need to have initiated warp. The eve server creates both sides if the wormhole the second the signature is created. The k162 is created, but has no signature allowing players to find it. Drifter w/o doesnt use signatures, they use wormholes, so a player can combat probe a drifter, and come through your static without you even touching it. This is extremely rare, as it requires a series if very unlikely steps to happen all together. Initiating warp to a wormhole starts the timer, but the server already figured out where it goes. This is what it does in the 60 seconds before the sig shows up.
---
Somewhat of an oversimplification, but there are a couple potential things going on here:
---
1) if you think everyone you meet is an asshole, it's not them. This is the pure, uncut, Occam's Razor explanation. Your post comes across quite reasonably so personally, I don't think this is the case.
---
That said, the "social deficits" blurb isn't going to positively influence many people's impressions of you on here, and if you're consistently letting slip negative connotations like that, intentionally or not, hostility is gonna pop up everywhere you go. Unpleasant or awkward people abound in Eve as in life, but there are many players who are very smart, socially adept, and remarkably sharp when evaluating others in-game/over comms.
---
2) it's just not a good fit personality-wise, and you should move on unless things change drastically in terms of your comfort level and their treatment of yiu.
---
3) They fucking suck, find a different corp/alliance.
---
There are lots of great people and corps in Eve, but it's mostly on you to not make yourself miserable by finding them. That dynamic can make the game incredibly engaging and fulfilling, or drive you away.
---
PH, dreddit, Karma Fleet all have lax requirements but after huge so you'll need to find your own tribe.
---
Eve Uni is good for new players and provides training.
---
I'm sure there are only if other good groups.  Don't apply to any high sec corps
---
This is not the norm, at least from my experience.
---
Find a small corp full of guys who have lives, and just get on EVE to have fun. From your experience, I wouldn't even bother with corps over 100 people, you'll just feel like you don't know anybody and that nobody cares about you.
---
There are plenty of corps that just like to talk shit to each other on comms and play their own game.
---
Are these corps in highsec? 
---
Generally Lowsec, Nullsec and Wormhole corps are fine. There's still shitters but fewer of them.
---
Ah take a look at what is actually happening in the city specifically before you talk in general about gentrification. Detroit isn't like most cities in that regard. It isn't pushing poor people out, but it isn't helping them either. It is an anomaly to most models and it is freaking out investors. There is a reason why people are so uneasy to invest in the area short of a handful of folks. This is not "normal" by any means.
---
I guess no one else got our sarcasm
---
Palpatine Keepstar should be flyable.
---
You’ve literally been blobbing people the past 6 months lol
---
Looks like a giant hecate to me...
---
/s helps
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page
---
Eve's mechanics are complex enough that you could explain them to a newbie for days, if not weeks. This is a game, it should be about entertainment. Eve in the first months is more learning from wiki, then actually playing. If you don't enjoy that, you'll leave eventually, but before that will be a drag on your corpmates. There are people in the game, who like to educate new players, like in E-Uni, but they are rare. It's a lot of work, without any garantee that you'll be staying.
---
Be more mindful, and google your questions first, then ask, instead of isulting them on reddit.
---
This is a nice chart, would you or anyone mind making one for all Trig ships ? Or at least add Vedmak, Leshak and Kikimora to it ?
---
Would love to see how they all compare.
---
Get Dunked. .
---
This looks almost as bad as the time I got molested in a Mcdonalds bathroom in Kentucky by a guy in leather pants.
---
nullsec entities.
---
cry about bots, apparently.
---
So the details of this are that provi only has numbers and members to cover the euro time zone. So literally any structure timed for any other play time is basically invincible; you can defend them with wet napkins.
---
given its size maybe it will take a fleet of caps to fight off
---
[https://imgur.com/YqPQwsP](https://imgur.com/YqPQwsP) :(
---
This one time at band camp...………………………………………………..
---
Second this. Black Rise is great for small gangs or micro gangs with friends if you wanna try to punch above your weight, but it's hell to play solo. I've been running around Minnie/Amarr space for the first time these past couple weeks and it is noticeably easier to find solid fights that don't end up in 3 worms warping into a novice gate after their buddy's daredevil has tackled your Rifter.
---
As an aside, if you do want to use a second account but not fully sell your soul, you could use that toon as a cloaky scout, just so you can make sure there aren't Huginns sitting on novice complexes, determine if there are gangs in system and which shops are in which complexes, etc.
---
A...Trigazar?
---
That's quite impressive for eyeballing. Does explain the upward curve at the back a bit too.
---
&gt;mars
---
Lol I like you sum up of goonswarm there mate. 
---
Basically most of the big groups you hear of are nullsec groups.  That’s where the massive expensive battles that make the press mostly come from so if that interests you I’d be looking for a nullsec group. 
---
Goonswarm stands out as it’s based on industry and fighting our enemies rather then holding large amounts of space and renting it out for others to live in.   If that sounds good look into joining Karmafleet which is our new player corporation. 
---
https://karmafleet.org
---
I'm going to reply to my own post here;
---
Generally speaking without a third party entity holding their hand they aren't able to contest the other local groups outside of the eutz.  Overall there is a really nice local conflict which occasionally third parties are invited to tip the balance of in any given engagement one way or the other.
---
Personally I think the region has been a great place to play eve in as provibloc rebuilds themselves. They've been doing quite well in their european timezone, just as we've been doing quite well in the us timezone.
---
3rd parties do get periodically invited by both sides to participate in skirmishes which will inevitably upset the local balance of power but overall the local drama has been extremely enjoyable  for everyone involved.
---
o7 provi (even though cva sux sox)
---
Interesting
---
The whole point of them doing that is all because of the high change of nc/pl to come try and help them. The reason we “blob the shit out of them” is because we expect a response, and sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t
---
russians are still cavemen more news at 11
---
Oh, I thought karmafleet was its own corp from seeing it being mentioned on reddit.
---
That may gonna help, Mark726’s EVE Lore Survival Guide 40:https://evetravel.wordpress.com/lore-survival-guide/
---
upvoted for keeping the meme alive.
---
Willing to bet this is probably a virus being handed out and idiots wanting to try out botting will get fucked lmao
---
Karma fleet is it’s own Corp in the goonswarm alliance.  It stands out as the only new player corporation in a larger alliance rather then in its own new player alliance in a coalition with other alliances.
---
Just as an aside, the GSF on that BR was our SNS fleet on a random roam, we didn't even know there was a battle going on lol.
---
You open it up in anticipation of great secrets. Inside it simply reads "LoL get a job and buy PLEX"
---
We won't be able to kill it.
---
It will jump from abyssal space to a system shut it down and release an Armada of ships to fight.
---
snuffed out more like blob out lol
---
Looks like he has no idea what he's doing, I hope his corpies give him a bit of help and guidance.
---
Good on provi to take the fight extremely outnumbered and on hostile structure
---
Take your daddy issues and fuck off
---
The ultimate anti botting tactic!  
---
CCP puts a bunch of fake botting programs up which then gives them all the information needed to ban them!
---
That's how eve play (you) dude...
---
Alpha centauri didn't had **civilopedia** nor any sort of techtree on screen in game so that guide is actually more useful then you give it credit for.
---
Certainly in 2003/4 this is how we were mining in Fountain. Corp mining ops in mining megas. I took a 15 year break - it’s been a learning curve. I probably relate to this book more than I do the current game :)
---
Don't bother with any corp using in-game ads exclusively.
---
Neat, now do the Molok!
---
And just the other days someone was basically telling me I was stupid and that was impossible in EVE's code. Huh ...
---
That's it??
---
An alliance is made up of many corps. Karma fleet is a corp. Goonswarm is an alliance.
---
it is so big it has a huge gravity field. it jumps into system and slowly the planet / moon / star comes to it.
---
If you are purely exploring and have good skills, you can fit an insta-warp ceptor with a cloak and probe launcher. The hacking will be more difficult then if you were suing a ship bonused for it, but it safely avoids bubbles and is very good at dodging other hunters.
---
Troll bait. Clearly a goonie that wants EVE community to know he has a big dick.
---
wow i just filled out my provibloc bumblefuck bingo card in a single killmail
---
great job APOC!
---
Yeah good on them for trying to batphone test lol
---
Troll bait. Clearly an anti-goonie that wants EVE community to know Goons are women.
---
Total bull, btw.
---
You are now too defensive on the whole “I have a dick” approach. Theory confirmed, you are a goon, and you have no dick.
---
Yeah So, alliances generally hold Sovereignty in 0.0 or null security space.   We live out here and build out the space with citadels and Infrastructure hubs and upgrade them to make the systems better to mine or have it spawn more NPC sites etc. 
---
The largest alliances such as goonswarm and Test alliance just have a lot of corporations in them.   The more corps/Bigger corps alliances have generally gives them advantages in pvp and in manufacturing / logistics.   
---
i don't want to massively oversimplify the game for you but ill say that  A lot of eve comes down to a numbers game, How many people can we put in fleet with  good ships vs how many can you get in fleet with good ships.    if force A brings say 300 more guys then force B - Force A has a much better chance of winning, not always but most of the time.      This is a very big reason alliances keep recruiting corps and corps keep recruiting individual people.
---
$6.5 is the best I can do!
---
Ahh poor poor you. Do you not have a family or a freind to stop you from being such a fool?
---
&gt; the only new player corporation in a larger alliance
---
doesn't that also describe Brand Newbros?
---
for the OP
---
[the Coalition level map](https://sov.space/) on the right side shows the major nullsec political divisions.
---
specifically clockwise from top right
---
GOTG (deadco)  
---
Panfam   
---
HRE  
---
Winter Co  
---
Legacy  
---
Provibloc  
---
Imperium (goons)
---
Null is made up of alliances of corporations, generally not single corporations
---
The alliances then make up coalitions of alliances, some have stronger bonds than others.
---
For instance, imperium (goons, tnt, lawn, init) have been together for quite some time, they're a pretty cohesive group, coming off of their loss in the North they have been doing well in delve
---
Legacy (test, brave, requiem, tikle, iou, w4rp, ...) is less cohesive, they formed much more recently than imperium and are still trying to find their way alone, legacy members are just recently getting organized together and for the first time being able to effectively defend themselves, they've been followed around the map as independent groups getting farmed for the past few years and are just now getting to a place where they're able to hold their own
---
Then there's some kind of loose conglomerate that is everyone else, mostly made up of panfam and winter coalitions, which are officially independent, but it doesn't actually matter. panfam is coming into the realisation that they're not (relatively) as strong as they once were. For a long time a lot of those guys used to constantly shit on alliances that accepted new players but those alliances grew into strong alliances that could challenge panfam and so they tried to emulate that with horde. Now they're constantly salty about how many players are in the alliances and coalitions that they used to follow around the map shitting on as if their saltiness made them any more effective at fighting in game
---
You are now too defensive on the whole “Goons are women” approach. New theory: you are a goon and you want feminists to support goons.
---
I mean, you probably haven’t been around long enough to remember, but goons were actual shitters and horrible people when they were actually a group from something awful. Most of it was in game, but stuff like the mittani at fanfest definitely was the out of game culture for goons as well.
---
Now since they let anyone in they’re overall a pretty tame group, but god damn was there reason to hate goons years ago.
---
r/evejobs
---
Are test alliance and goonswarm the largest alliances?
---
Everyone on reddit is a bot, except you.
---
The largest are goons and tapi.
---
What they do you are asking? Crabbing and feeding.
---
You assumed that me saying Goons have no dicks ment I was calling them “women”. That is something-phobic for sure,

Isn’t brave a newbro alliance.  I will admit I’m a bit sketchy on the whole set up down there

It says something that im not surprised to see this comment from the EVE community.
---
So why the hell do you expect your enemies to go to a region they don't live in to fight your cap fleet? If you wanted a fight quick you come to detorid its pretty simple.
---
Daaamn... show me on this doll where PL touched you.
---
Well to be fair 350 dudes would be hard to fight even in EU tz. But we continue onwards.

Or just take fresh amarrians for each job.
---
Yes

Why you want to join pirate Corp if you were a hauler?

Impressive!

But you did one tiny mistake :

He asked for humans, amarrians don't fall under that category

Good post

Eunuchs then? Are you implying that they all castrated themselves to practice the Sunflower Manual?

why did you think this was relevant for this sub?

Crabbing and feeding?

I legitimately didn't know thank you

Great idea! thanks
---
The Goons side of EVE is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be... unnatural.
---
Welcome to EVE Online. You’ll hate it eventually, yes.
---
But by then you’ll be addicted like the rest of us.
---
Goons are definitely the largest, test and horde are about the same size
---
Can't believe I'm being down voted for this
---
I know for a fact that TRI started batphoning NC because Snuff called Init very often.
---
My penis
---
But it's true regardless, panfam used to drop supers on everything that moved. Now they're coming off a failed invasion of test
---
Yeah that’s the point
---
It’s like a conditioned neuropathy that’s been inherent in goon culture since before EVE existed. 
---
But youngbloods like to pretend it’s about a war that was more about playing the game than anything to do with you. Don’t forget your history little bee, once upon a time it was grr BoB and goons were the little guys against the empire.
---
Well ofc u mean hostile citadels in your own sov able to tz tank to your weakest tz. Oh and  they bring horde along as well. Yes, we are unable to fight out numbered on a hostile forti grid in our weakest tz and win every fight.

But I suppose even rc have the same problems at times when we randomly do the same

One fight where we win with help one fight where we lose with help, in the same week.

Look forward to the next one

Everyone that can, always has, always will.  I get that it sucks when you get outnumbered, but this game encourages it.  There is no double loot chance and an sp boost if you kill a group outnumbered or under shipped.
---
And you just contribute to the hate in a meaningless and childlike fashion. It’s fascinating to watch.
---
I'll smoke one for ya buddy, see out there in the cold. o7
---
Ha! Grab a T1 frig and roam around Delve. Record yourself, and if no fucking Titan tries to DD you on the gate, I’ll give you 100m.
---
Test is at least a bit better, they’ll only drop normal caps on you.
---
PL invaded Test?
---
shhhhhh they will blob you next on their next reddit op!
---
If you want to join the largest coalition in the game, join the goons or any entity related to them. For example, Goons are ahead of The Imperium. The Imperium is like 50k accounts on paper but it's truly much larger as Test Alliance Please Ignore (TAPI) are enslaved to them. TAPI has their own coalition of like 30k accounts. In summary, for the Imperium and friends, they're probably over 80k accounts. Objective = blue everyone instead of fighting. More blues = safety in numbers against pvpers.
---
The other well known entity is PanFam. Pandemic Legion (elitists), Pandemic Horde (best new player alliance in game), and Northern Coalition (the Fam part). I think Panfam is still under 20,000 accounts. Less blues = more people to shoot at.
---
The upcoming force is Fraternity and Co. From what I know is that they're predominately Asian. As you can expect, they're mostly China/Korea/Aussie TZ. They're growing very fast, which makes TAPI scared, hence TAPI kneeling to the Imperium for mercy. More Asians = More Asians = Hive Mind/Collective force/Great accomplishments
---
Other than the major blocs, there are a lot of great entities to join. Not everyone likes playing with the giants so they'll dive into more specialized groups. They may not make headlines but there is a greater chance to actually know one another on the individual level.
---
I leave you with a biased ultimatum. If you want to be a zombie, join Goons/Friends. If you want to kill the zombies, join Panfam. If you want to be Asian and grow super fast, join Fraternity. If you want to kill the scraps of Goons and Panfam, join anyone else. I just encourage you to join, SOMEONE. Eve is truly Eve when you join an organization.
---
So its a Jump drive capable citadel ? I like this.
---
Fantastic work. Also one of my favourite skins I wish they'd put back in the New Eden store. I did start drawing a picture of a Nidhoggur myself but never finished it.
---
Ask them if they will double your isk, to find out if they are legit or not.
---
yeh, it is the circle of life; we got thoroughly skull fucked the other day too for the same reasons.
---
Good shit.
---
TLDR Blob them all, then complain about being blobbed at a later date.
---
Well said.
---
bless calsf for the 9UY black market
---
Because some people want to try something new?
---
I’m not complaining about being blobbed, I find it weird people don’t understand people play the game for content so yeah I’m gonna go shoot things, people don’t usually think about overkill, especially when they expect that the enemy will bring more
---
It got a bit better old, I’m bored.

Thank you!

Oh I know it, that’s how you win. I just dislike how he tried to spin it as “content” and “oh but we dont usually”
---
Best looking carrier next to Archon. Great work.
---
Fair enough
---
sup olmeca :)
---
I wasn't really referring to regionally dropping supers. I was talking about when panfam had more than regional supremacy, before jump fatigue when they could jump across the Galaxy quickly
---
It was just after pls failed invasion of provi for faction stations. They went home for a short time, gathered a group to help them invade and then doomchinchilla made his  "we're not here for good fights, we don't care if we're blobbing them, tapi talked shit and now we're going to evict them, they're going to be homeless soon" remark. Shortly after that remark him and his coalition lost the first big super engagement in the South and they went home again, leaving winter to lose parts of their space and make the peace payments
---
I don't hate PL or anything but their slow motion change from being on top to where they're at now has been kind of amusing though. The best part is how they stick to their "we're better than you" attitude despite everything
---
Ya, you look pretty salty/dumb in that thread.

Stop posting on reddit please.

I am impressed how close your approximation got to the guy who mathed it out to 35k humans.

Can anyone tell me the name of the song at the end of the video? Thanks

&gt;A platitude is a trite, meaningless, or prosaic statement, often used as a thought-terminating cliché, aimed at quelling social, emotional, or cognitive unease.[1]
---
&gt;Platitudes have been criticized as giving a false impression of wisdom, making it easy to accept falsehoods:
---
&gt;"A platitude is even worse than a cliché. It’s a sanctimonious cliché, a statement that is not only old and overused but often moralistic and imperious. ... [P]latitudes have an aphoristic quality, they seem like timeless moral lessons. They therefore shape our view of the world, and can lull us into accepting things that are actually false and foolish.[1]"

So like. Most are bad yes.

That's one of those retarded flair baiters. He keeps complaining about TEST or anyone else that bring bigger fleets than Panfam or BL.
---
You mainly rely on the buffer of 3x LSEs and the DPS you do. No regen or dcu on the lows, just damage. I used to run 1 C3-x ballistic and 2 navy drone damage amps, 3 navy LSE and 2 c-type invulns (might have been b-type, it's been a while), and heavy missiles with a small nos. Usually the neuts hit you all at the same time, and they all have a fairly long cycle it seems(cruiser are 12s, battleships are 24s). My nos was keeping both invulns active under 3 neuting leshaks. Before the nos I lost a couple Gila's in T4. After fitting it, zero losses. Of course standard strategies still apply, never burn directly to the drifter bs, burn away from heavy ewar ships when entering to buy time etc. Also if you have good resist mods, don't just go for gammas, the filaments are overpriced and you can get timed out if you get 2 drifter or drone bs. Electrical and exotic are fairly doable too, but avoid firestorm and dark like the plague.
---
To be waterboarded for hours? No, thanks. Frat couldn't have provided us with any good fights, and we went elsewhere. I still think I would have been more fun if we set desto to 1DQ.
---
Faction ewar frigs are also worth a look, at least for the vigil fleet and crucifier navy. 
---
Imo, the biggest thing is to remain unpredictable so people don’t either switch to a hard counter or run away when they see you

Oh gotcha lol

I’ve gotten a few of em, honestly hilarious when someone adds like 100 people to a mail lol
---
&gt;  they also hate Chinese people so...

the numerous chinese corps and players within goonswarm is an excellent example of just how much they hate the chinese people.

Look amazing

Mmmmhmmmm. I was totes malotes being super serious, my guy.

Rolled through Deklein tonight and passed hundreds of VNI scum botting. Wasn’t till we tackled a rorq with &amp; enyos we got a fight.....really fucking sad and needs fixing

Remember. Two thin coats are always better than one thick coat. How many coats, how thick will the coats be?

Test also batphoned goons after TRI called in FRT, Horde, BL, PL, NC. GotG, Volta, SkillU, BoG etc.other to evict them. Yet you keep complaining about that one.

Kinda weird you bring up this argument in defence of TRI.

Genuine question, why are you still here?

Thanks. I'm hoping to get back on this afternoon, so hopefully the Nos will work out.

No one krabs in a C4.  It was a C4 with a C3/5 Static, we did our krabbing there.

do you got any idea about the amounth of "real" people in NC. and PL? 
---
you talk about them beeing at the bottom because they don´t win every single fight like they used to, in fact it's amazing that a group of a few hundred real people spread out across multiple timezones can still play in the same league as a group of 8000 like CONDI.
---
It is in fact still a ship (supported by the description for it in Singularity, in which it is described as a ***vessel***, not a station), but in terms of game mechanics it acts like a station. Note that the model for the Xordazh still has very visible engines on its rear end.

Nah, the neut bomber decloaked less than 1 sec after the FC first said to turn on props. Turned out to just be fantastically bad luck on their part (and very, very *good* luck for someone else, jfc).
---
Perhaps new Trig officer mining lasers are coming
---
Yea, I agree with you. My 3 or 4 (depending on what's subbed) are 2 combats, 1 scout and a logistics. The real issue you're referring to are the people with 10 rorqs or what not which are typically simple to multibox since there is not a whole lot of input required and make plenty to plex, so they drive up Plex demand, and de-value mining for the small timers.  
---
I think it's a large contributing factor which overall hurts the game.  I don't really know what the solution is but I feel like the most rewarding content in the game should require a more active user, which could fix a lot of the excessive multi-box and botting issues.

Speak for yourself. I make a whole hell of a lot more doing T5 abyssals than I ever did missioning or gas mining. Even in my C13 hole, my income has more than doubled using a kikimora over a confessor because the clear time is so much faster.
---
Generally the gameplay of the alliances allied with Goons consists of having as large numbers as possible and mining minerals 23/7 (in EVE speech - krabbing or crabbing) in order to ... be able to get more mining ships to mine more minerals, so that they can have more ships to mine more minerals... you got the point.
---
Feeding points on a fact that **as an average**, Goons and their pets have lower knowledge about the game and lower focus in the fleet, which turns into worse results in a combat situation where forces are about equal. Again, as an average. There are groups that clearly stand above (INIT, some sigs within The Imperium, maybe Predditors? and so on)
---
Additionally, due to lack of awareness, those mining ships are often a pray for more focused groups (let's call them PVP corporations/alliances). However, this is a trait they share with the rest of nullsec.

These are the kinds of posts, where people try to prove how elite and tryhard some groups are, that amuse me

People bragging about how much effort they put into everything while still losing is amusing. NC can barely beat the groups that prothean alliance fought off for months yet people still get on Reddit to tell everyone about their leetness and their effort, as if that meant anything outside of their own circlejerks

These kinds of posts remind me of tests moral narrative posts, just less interesting

IRL it's the police's job to punish people for breaking the law but you still shouldn't hire someone who you know or strongly suspect is doing so, and refuse to report them to the police.

he doesn't need to, he's already running it, his ISK milking corp is "weave" and the tagline is "weave with us". More cult than corp but who cares.

Nothin new about Delve

Its more adorable when they do it on the Facebook group.

what people do outside of work is, as an employer, absolutely none of my fucking business as long as it doesn't impact their ability to do their job.
---
I’m having the same issue.  I’m hoping CCP gets back to me soon; I want to play.
---
He said pirates, not risk averse losers who camp undocks in jita and amarr
---
The analogy here though is that they have a habit of breaking the law while working. "Outside of work" would be analogous to stuff they do in other games.
---
Dunno why people are downvoting this. 
---
Why THE FUCK should we have to deal with it, maybe if the game was free but...
---
CCP don’t even seem to have any sort of plan, strategy or ideas on how they could make it harder for bots...even though botting has been a problem for years and has ramped up to the point that it’s seriously effecting the game and legit players. 
---
I worry as well that those players are going to be tempted to bot just so they can keep up.
---
not really - a corp doesn't require you to be doing corp stuff 100% of the time you are logged in.
---
just like my boss doesn't expect me to be working 24/7, he only expects me to be working for 8 hours a day.

Uninstall /s

no, fucking no.

unless they are PAYING ME i am not doing THEIR JOB for them - and nor should any of the rest of us.

Aye good point, I guess I was meaning more that I’m not gonna do their job while I’m paying multiple subs a month, but you’re right - we should be getting paid for it...maybe ingame rewards or something, though that would be a lot of work for them to implement.

For question 1: There are lots of resources for SKINs. Some can/could be bought from the NES for PLEX, some drop from events, some can drop from npc ships, some from npc structures. And then you've got skins that are given in combination with DLC packs, for attendance of player events, or as rewards for in-game events. In short: lots of different sources. If looking for a specific skin, you're better off saying which one, since it's a lot easier to find the source of a specific skin.

This is what i've been running and it's been pretty good so far. And pays for itself after around 4 C3 sites. The shield boost amps could be meta'd down. The drones could be changed out for faction drones. But i don't reccomend shifting down any of the cap or tank unless you know what you are doing.

Too many bloody hands to acurately judge.

If the aim was to SD in the end you should have just done that to begin with and save yourselves 2 hours

oh god i never expected these kind of posts to pop up on r/eve
---
I used to use a passive shield regen svipul for  low class wormhole sites. Fast and tanky with good damage application and your shield recharges as quickly as you take damage. Was nice. I'm sure you could Google one up. I think they cost about 80mil to set up. That was a year and a half ago, might have changed slightly.

Tri position themselves as a non-blob PvP-seeking alliance. We took that at face value. You telling me they are not that and in fact they are just another "we won't fight outnumbered" semi-PvP alliance as all others?
---
Wow, that were some quick replys, thank you guys :3  
---
For the Skins:   
---
I am looking for Hurricane Skins and Typhoon skins, as I really like those two ships and want to fly them regular when I do have more money to spare (and some better skills for better equipment). The Skins in question are:  
---
 Cordite (one in the market for like 800.000.000, which is a biit much), bloody hands, Firewall Breach, Hazard Control, Headhunter, IGC or Valklear Glory.   
---
Ps: thank you for the tip with the skins, Jackpkmn
---
And for the WH:  
---
The Praxis is one of those special ships from the log in bonus, if I do see it right. Is there a way to build a new one when I lose it? Because I will die even with a good fit for it if an other player comes for me, so I would like to not risk it right now :o
---
Last year we were in the Imperium and were forced to participate in the coalition's lag-fests as well as our own compaigns - helping Frat against Test, dunking XIX, facing off PH etc. Heavily outnumbered on all of them.
---
This year we are on our own again and do not have to go to 5k local ti-di "fights". 
---
If you were blobbed that doesn't mean that is all we do. It just means that out of 17 fights we had that week - the two times you called in all your friends to finally get an edge over us - got swarmed by Init.

Meh, the hecate looks so round and squishy, i like the aggressive angles more. Also thicc boi is thicc and i have a massive ladyboner for big fuckin ships
---
VNI ratting is one of the lowest nullsec income activities but most people prefer it because of the amount of effort involved. There are significantly better ways to make isk.
---
Nope can't build them. Other players will put them on the market and plenty will be for sale. Just like the gnosis and gecko drones. All were gifts at one time (geckos long time ago) but continue to be on the market.

Hopefully it's a bit more all encompassing that Sansha Incursions. Trig fleets attacking HS stations (no point targeting LS as there's no-one there to watch).

And by amarrians you mean the minmatar slaves in their possession
---
Nah it's just the same capsuleer over and over again

Ah ok, i dont know any Estonian corps LOL

At low graphics it is just a blanket recolor o.o but some rarer skins have details even at low. Maybe it's on purpose.

WoW is struggling because Blizzard stopped caring. They make much more money off of a card game than their MMO, so they are in the actual process of sunsetting it. BfA was bad for a reason.

Joined horde recently and ignoring the politics of the bitter feud between goons, the north etc. Horde has a ton of content lots of fleets and targets to shoot on doorstep could be the same for goons really but as a bitter vet who has played since 05/06 haven't had a much fun in years flying cheap doctrines blowing stuff up instead of forcing fights in expensive stuff hoping to get a decent fleet fight in low sec.

I found multiple forum tread and reddit post about market bots, maybe that can help you found a pattern.

Btw, go destroy those finals! :D

Lol what danguses.  Whats lancing? Im not hip to the lingo anymore :/
---
1. hard to say, but I've heard the Amarr/Minmitar war zone is currently more active after the exodus of the Cadari/Galenta war zone. I'm sure you could get fights in both however. You will get more fights if you don't join either side, but you won't gain LP if you go that rout.
---
2. 20 mil is enough for all the T1 and faction frigs, but you will need to either subscribe or use injectors for anything past 5 mil
---
3. You will definitely be able to support the ships if you stick to T1 frogs with the occasional faction frig. You will probably have enough profit to dump into SP, but it will be slow going, you probably won't be able to afford a daily skill injector every day.
---
Let the Gallenteans paint their vessels their way. We’re Minmatar
---
I need that RTX technology
---
Lances are like a bosonic field generator but are much longer range and much thinner.
---
They’re used by titans against subcaps and “smaller” capitals to delete the fleet off field. Preferred over bosons when you aren’t dictating the range against the fleet you’re fighting
---
"skill injectors dont provide good content'
---
was nice, ty INIT
---
My break was 11 years. I like the current game, but I also liked the non-specialized nature of the game back then.
---
Ahh that sounds crazy, thanks!
---
they are anchored on your HUD, you can have your HUD on top like the screenshot or at the bottom of the screen, just search the rightclick options on it, if you hold your mouse in the capacitor center you can also move the whole thing left and right
---
This is actually accurate
---
how did this happen? did CVA fight the defenders head on knowing that they were massively outnumbered or did Horde only join the fight after it started?
---
Damn can you believe the stealth and tactical skill it took to get a fleet that big on to grid with multiple Rorqs without being reported in intel? That's impressive lads, nice work!
---
How is this Reddit worthy? It's not even shitpost worthy. FRT do this to test on a daily basis and if memory serves me right from keeping track of zkill, init have done this to test for the last 2 weeks also. Everyone knows caps struggle against stukas. Bring us something worthy FFS!
---
at quick glance... there is no rigs thus giving it no real tank. Also the amount of damage it took to take it out leaves me to believe he might have been afk as well.
---
They once jumped a full cta machariel fleet into a wormhole and got rolled in, they had to log out without a prober and it came up on reddit, about that time the alliance activity also dropped into irrelevance again, so some say they are still stuck in there.
---
It can be. I’ve found no more salt out of a fleet in this game than an fc warping 150 dudes straight into their demise.
---
Oh no they would off been reported. Just no one listened
---
So far we know that its gonna be an incursion like system with tig "invasions" of systems.
---
It seems to be that that thing is the trig version of the sansha motherhsip.
---
If its listed as a station it might be because its a static asset that "opens a portal to abyss space" for the invasion but in the lore its a mobile ship
---

Pen and paper RPG gaming, saving roll you rolled a natural 20 like a pro.

What works differs per person but I'd say: have standards, this may sound weird but it's important to not just join the first group you see, to not do the first thing you've ben told to do and simply refuse to accept a level of crappiness  from what you're doing, who you're flying with but ALSO how you're behaving yourself.
---
Have standards.
---
For yourself that means putting in active effort to figure stuff out, to learn, to try and improve, to ask for help but also realise that most people suck at this game so to question their statements, to WANT to achieve. To NOT to ask "what's easy" but instead "what is interesting and teaches me the most". Put in effort to figure out things, to plan. To GIT GUD!
---
For what you do it means to not go for the obvious, the easy and the path that takes no effort and to realise that doing this generally means you have to NOT do what others tell you to do, because most people are lazy and crap at this game. To find things to  do that you actually ENJOY and simply ignore things that you do not enjoy. It's really easy actually, there's so many play styles, so many ways to get isk why on earth pick something to do that is boring? Simply REFUSE things that are boring, it's just a mindset.
---
For who you fly with realise that since most people suck at this game and are lazy as hell, most corps will be exactly the same. Realise that most "newbie friendly" groups aren't at all newbie friendly, they are ALT friendly (which is something very different) and they're not interested in you at all, they just want warm bodies for their fleets and indoctrinate you, yet another new player, with their warped and revised version of EVE history and politics.
---
Have standards when it comes to the corps you join, "we do everything it'll be fun come join us" corps generally are crap and full of crap. You have standards so you require your CORP to also have standards, if they have no recruitment requirements at the entrance it's going to be crap and you can't build anything on crap. 
---
If you LOVE massive groups and fleets then go for it but if you want a more personal approach, don't join any of the "newbie friendly" massive groups because you'll be just a number. Find something smaller, something less obvious where personal interaction happens and matters more.
---
Have standards, find your own way, your own source of income and play style, your own goals and "end game". Ignore what most other players tell you because they're crap (and that probably includes me).
---
Then there’s the 2x Large Shield Booster II tank
---
That’s a pretty great Corp name though
---
Wow. He reported three whole bots.
---
Fucking. Amazing.
---
He did it by yet again shitting on another alliance? Even better! So useful! So meaningful!

The original meme was "my raven was fit with the following" and it applies here because the guy actually fit his Phoenix, a dreadnought that normally uses capital weapons and fittings, with modules intended for a raven.

Thanks!
---
Enough to justify a crusade agaijst minmatar degenerates
---
We didn't want to feed cap kills to FRT for no reason. You see how they act right? Look at this thread... they show up for the last few minutes of a thunderdome and its all "CHINESE OVERLOARDS"&lt;sic&gt;.
---
They landed more than a couple. Even killed a couple of dudes. FC dodged the lances pretty well and when he wasn't sure he could he asked for a boosh. Even when i ate a boson in my hyena the shields got to around 70%~. Getting 124 damage per boson tick.
---
I would recommend t2 frogs, they have that extra ribbit that he will want.
---
i used to blops 3 rattles a night
---
Well the question is do you want wholesome organic blood thats sustainable or just a slaughterhouse status?
---
We streamed it man.. there's no need for spin. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/420366051 You can watch from the very beginning.. us fighting CVA.. getting doomsday's on the keepstar. We thunderdome'd for 30 minutes and then after all the fax and subcaps are dead .... FRT shows up.
---
Unrelated but I still can't even understand how the fucking hell you can misspell Minmatar twice in a row, even though it's listed in the picture, you see it in game all day long, and it's pretty much everywhere. How? How do you?
---
i like how its like 3 dozen titans against some bombers, what has happend to EVE
---
So you didn’t lost a ton of caps? The br must be fucked I guess )
---
You must think lumpymayo is the most elite PvPer in existance.
---
Well played
---
JESUS CHRIST how does one loose 300 caps and be *THAT BAD*?
---
I'm not sure you are following. This wasn't an alliance fleet... this was a fun fleet paid for by one person. We didn't "lose" anything. The caps were handed out to everyone.
---
Is this the new “already replaced”? You’re right though, you guys did awesome. Super apologies, Ron.
---
They won't be replaced.... it was a fun roam. No SRP. Do you not understand what that means? BidiXXL built all the caps himself and handed them out for the fleet so we could have fun.
---
it's axis is like 55 km long  
---
let's not jump to conclusions

---
hey about injectors its not a biggie. I might get omega now and then after i train the first 5mil sp, if i still play then, i just dont want to do it right away or every month.
---
Mate, I don’t give a fuck who gave you the caps or if CCP magically spawned them, if you read my first comment I was laughing at how badly you did. No one cares about isk anymore..
---
Great news for goons, just the boost to their economy thats needed, no point in supply without demand. 
---
Dude is surprisingly chill about it, guess that comes with practice
---
&gt;using the reddit app   
---
why
---
I understand there's a need to shit on everyone for every super loss, but I really wish it would ease up a bit. Yes, it was bad and all that.. but he's also streaming and providing content for everyone. He puts himself out there by streaming himself in a super, so obviously he's going to get stream sniped to hell and back. Which he did. He wasn't upset about it. He didn't freak out and look at all the dreads that had tons of fun. I'm just saying, give the guy a break.
---
are you retarded or just plain stupid?
---
Self destructing worked pretty well. No need to freak out.
---
Ah the things we have to do because of a stupid local chat channel.
---
He doesn’t give a shit about losing a super  because he pays everything with credit card , I Bet he doesn’t even has reddit and doesn’t care about that posts
---
It's kinda strange how excited this makes you....eh this isn't true at all. People feel better about themselves when other people fail. I get it. Carry on.
---
Short answer: Game got changed to Capitals Online
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/72311997/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72311997/) reminds me of this one

---
Ah, Disenchantment 2nd edition. Wonder how many people the mods will ban for pointing out the flaws in this one?
---
He's a streamer and his schtick is brawling with suicide capitals. So who cares?
---
Imagine cryposting on reddit just because you don't like people knowing where the bots are. Would you by any chance be the elusive anette4?
---
Oh, you didn't watch the video of the roam? You should.. we had a blast. We had some great fights with CVA too. Much to their chagrin, FRT was not involved.. as much as you guys like posting like you did.
---
i saw that each race had two lances, amarr one had something called a "reaper"? what's the difference?
---
I appreciate Evan for the content he brings to New Eden, as well as his contribution to raising the mineral prices and lowering PLEX prices.
---
People feel better about themselves when they can attribute malice to other people and then try and farm outrage sympathy. I get it. Carry on.
---
Apply some critical thinking and click on any death. You can also scroll down on reddit and find the thread where this BR was linked and see for yourself what happened in comments.
---
Are you fucking retarded?
---
I don’t give a shit if he posts about bots. I give a shit about the fact that he’s shit stirring for karma and fucking shit for brains are upvoting him after his *entire story* got shown to be bullshit last time on multiple levels.
---
Hi, oldspiceland!
---
I am am just dropping by to wish you a lovely day! Take care!
---

---
im convinced Evan is extremely rich IRL and has conceded that he can't invest the time and effort needed to be the best player in eve, so he will try his hardest to be the worst.
---
Noone can reasonably afford THAT many supercarriers and be that stupid, right?
---
If this guy lost 300 capitals in his EVE career, do you honestly believe that the 301st would matter more to him?
---
You clearly do give a shit about him posting about bots. And it's looking to me like the only reason you give a shit is because you're upset over the fact that they're renting from your blues. Go back to bitching about how people shit on your dumpster alliance, sweetie.
---
I did see some deaths are TEST only, others are by FRT. Deaths to FRT are around 33 bil, still above the 25 bil you mentioned.

He just wants PVP in capitals, ... RED, Nutral or Blue.. who cares, everyone is target.. he will just move down the list if there are not enough targets.

Um, where did I say I was in FRT, they’re as bad as any other bloc. Once again, and hopefully you listen, I was laughing at you guys dying in a fire, Jesus Christ man are you so desperate to spin “we don’t even care”? I guess test really need positivity these days though, eh ))
---
tbh i wasn't paying attention i just saw 100000 ships jump on the dude and assumed because that's all that ever goes in in nullsec
---
I've seen on some videos that people on their overview where you see enemy ships and getting red boxed and stuff that it also shows which ships pit tackle on you and webs and everything. It's not on any overview I ever used? Is it just a noob thing experienced players don't use? I think that would be pretty neat informations
---
As far as I can see now, you can’t. Annoyingly inconsistent! I had assumed the log would just be a record of the in-space messages.

IIRC, you cannot share faction standings, only agent / corp standings.

Well it didn't work well, so arguably in this case it's not so much caps online but more "capital proliferation" due to the aging game.
---
Next wave is the Outuni wave, broadcast for capacitor if you are targeted by the Outunis, do not broadcast for cap while the Outunis are on grid unless you have Outuni aggro, full fleet Outuni tags 1 and 2...
---
I would legitimately laugh my ass off if they coded an easter egg that kills it whenever someone warps through the model.
---
...for like a week, and then after that it would get old.
---
Link killmail plz
---
Show us on this doll where the nullsec blob touched you.
---
I actually don't know what this means.  If it means the times I've died I'm a newer player and have only died to npc ships.
---
How is it sad? I think it's great that I only have to work less than an hour IRL to have several months of fun in EVE.
---
It did not work here because they did not land any lances/boson. One good hit would have ended the bomberfleet. 
---
They also did not bring many FAXes. 10 more and how much would have died?
---
One could argue that he only provided content and fun for a very small amount of players.  
---
I have to admit I like his stoic look while doing so, but I don't think it is interesting to watch or will pull a lot of new players in (as apposed to some other streamers).  
---
That being said, he is an adult and can spend his ingame and irl ISK however he wants :)
---
Yeah you have fun with that. I’m going to keep working my job and not spending hours to grind isk.
---
He’s is basically saying link a killmail of a ship you lost that you’re salty about.
---
Meh, say about Snuff what you want, they definitely regularly take fights outnumbered.
---
Isk is just cosmetic in Eve
---
They guy was probably like hey why did i die? I have this big ship with lots of hp... how did tiny ships kill me?
---
I disagree. Where is the fun without big sharks spending tons of money on Eve?
---
that is what he says. he could be lying
---
You mean TAPI and INIT are coming off a failed invasion of PL. Nice try :)
---
[He's put at least $20,000 into the game](https://clips.twitch.tv/FurtiveZanyMooseBabyRage)
---
I should have kept reading. You got saltier as the conversation continued. When you realized NC and PL are the most alts per human in Eve, maybe it'll set in that the "spartans" of Eve are not taken lightly. This is why during B-R the CFC needed the russians to win. This is why during WWB the Imperium was evicted from the north. Whether you like it or not, the tryhards in PanFam are extremely effective at winning wars. It takes coalitions of 80k+ people to truly contend
---
why nc fags are a bunch of trihards?
---
Having lots of isk/plex does not automatically make you a better pilot or guarantee any level of success. Most of the skills and knowledge you will need are gained over time through making mistakes and learning from them. There are plenty of wallet warriors that get curb stomped everyday because they lack the experience to make use of their new found assets. Don't get too hung up on grinding ISK either, because its a good way to get burnt out and loose interest in the game. Focus on learning the ropes, making friends and doing what you find to be fun and interesting.
---
money does not get you an advantage in this game, wich is why you can buy ships w/ plex'ed isk and still get owned by someone in a slasher, unlike other games where you can buy OP armor or OP weapons, EVE does not offer "GOLD Modules"    
---
so nothing wrong really w/ people plexing their wallets
---
EVE Online used to be a subscription based game, which means you absolutely had to pay with cash, or you had to fuck off after trial, no alphas, no injectors, no free bot alts and it was best model so far, for me and many others.
---
At certain point CCP fucked the game up big time and numbers started to fall and some genius came with worst possible solution, Free2Play, which ultimately turned into pay2win.
---
TL;DR be glad you are allowed to play at all.
---
I will post below some copy/paste i found in other sources as i dont know much about tutorial:
---
"If you have not done the tutorial using the Agency tab, then you can do the entire tutorial from the beginning. Just find "The Seeker Investigation" in the Agency tab, and follow the instructions."
---
"You might not be able to redo the brand new starter intro.  But you can do the career agents since you probably did not do them before.  Agency tab and drop down on type and select career agent.  Start convo and see if available. Maybe try to add the rookie channel too? "
---
That's just Evan. It's what he does.
---
Again, no it isn't.  We were blobbed just recently by other lowsec groups.
---

Just pointing out that a minority of chinese read this sub. Why would anyone get mad about this kind of post?
---
I mean I'm not sure that I would be bragging about self destructing to avoid a fight but here you guys are
---
Have not played in a few years...dropping 24+ titans on bombers is a thing now?
---
I like how the comment here is "Yeah, 10 more FAXes and it would have been a different story". 
---
Thank you Captain Obvious. Who would have thought bringing 10 more capital logistic ships to a fight would make a difference..
---
Talked myself in a position where I had to leave muh beloved corp and went back to highsec. Met several old friends from years ago there as well as some new guys that seem to be nice. Witnessing a nice small-scale highsec-war where folks actually fight for their turfs. Cool stuff right there :)
---
And since I firesold most of my null-stuff already I wont needa care about making ISK for a long, long time in HS. Can mine as a hobby without caring bout efficiency, shoot rats, buy whatever regular ship I please to fly around.  
---
Life can be so chill and comfortable :)
---
Ser my two posts below i found as replies by others on reddit.
---
Also this Eve uni wiki explains everything:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/New_Player_Experience_Tutorial_-_Seeker_Investigation
---
Also why not join eve uni. The premier corporation for pilot training. You can leave them without problems if you want to move to another corp in the future. But to start they would be the best way for you to learn the game.
---
They have training classes on anything and are super organised. They have been in this game for 15 years prob, almost since atart.
---
thanks for the clarification!

TEST speaking about hypocrisy? Really? Test? C'mon.
---
You do realise that SNUFF never called themselves anti-blob, right? Or postured all over reddit as "we fight all our fight on our own". SNUFF is well known to drop dread-bombs, to ruse-cruise, to ambush and to go to 0.0 in non-commit doctrines like Tengus or NMs, and fight almost anyone, regardless of coalitions. That is what we do and do well. Tri on the other hand did position themselves as an independent 0.0 entity who fight on their own for fun because they like it. Something we can respect. As long as they don't go all hypocritic themselves on that - all is good. 
---
So. I'm gonna ask again - are YOU telling me, that Tri is not an independent 0.0 alliance who fight on their own against any odds for the heck of it?
---
I'd rather do what he is doing than be the nerd trying to make drama posts about him.
---
How has the PLEX value been impacted?
---
Well it started with just keeping up with the game, though the last few years I've wondered that too.  I guess I opened a salt mine.
---
what the fuck...
---
Meh
---
If the man is having fun let him be, he’s an adult that can make his own decisions on how to spend his money and specially how to spend him pixel money, yet geeks like you feel the need to put their nose in everybody’s business, it’s a fucking game lmao, some of you take this shit waaaaay too serious.
---
Wait what? We are famous right now
---
Its a VNI fittings and method from what I can tell. Here is a Test member using Brush Monster... https://www.bilibili.com/video/av23046785/
---
I am worried for this person. Video gaming addiction is a thing. If they work at 7-Eleven as someone else pointed out, then that is usually minimum wage.
---
He plays a video game, creates content for others to enjoy, doesn't seem particularly vengeful about it and congratulates his opponents for a job well done, how is he stupid?
---
This man couldn’t have said it better. 
---
I’ve made some of the mistakes he mentioned and I completely agree... Few months ago when I started playing, I tricked myself into injecting and buying plex for isk then I thought I’d go to FW and learn to pvp, I bought a daredevil went to FW and within 15minutes I got kited and blapped by a T1 frig, that should speak for itself.
---
Y my bad for ambiguity, me too because of that, still think it's a great game
---
Imagine you grind forever to buy a titan. Then you want to use that thing as often as you can, don't you?
---
by failing to transport his ships? it's not that hard..
---
why doesn't he just drop 1v50 on provi blocks like lasker does with dreads if he wants to generate content outright? i feel like it would be more fun (respect to him for doing it either way)
---
i just feel like there are a lot more entertaining things one could do with a supercarrier other than just.. welping it
---
Whats even more funny is all the People bitching about this guy cant affford half the shit he losses.
---
Look at him he dont give a shit, 16 B ha fuck it il just buy another one.
---
Some of us in TEST like the idea of delayed local in nullsec. You won’t show up in local until you break gate cloak.
---
The downside to this though is if you’re hunting in massive 50 or even 80 AU systems. It wouldn’t be worth it.
---
If CCP won’t remove local or give it a delay after breaking cloak or for even ~10 seconds after decloaking, people can bot their lives out
---
My shading style is pretty smudgey lol. I'll work on that, thank you for the feedback!
---
This is such a dumb opinion.
---
Getting the basics of eve down isn't hard, and after that more money literally means percentage damage or ehp.
---
I personally am fine with eve's version of p2w(along with similar systems other games are adapting), but to try and say it isn't p2w is just dumb.
---
How's he affording all this then? That much Plex is pricey.
---
Ah, I'd love to see it - I'm sure it looks cool even though it isnt finished!
---
Judging by detail of AAR, I predict this took INIT 6 months to plan
---
I agree, that's part of the reason I drew it lol. Thank you!
---

---
Always kill Jeen first
---
Thank you! I love this ship in this skin

Someone's jealous they can't afford to lose 300 supers.

---

---
Considering he's spent more than $20,000 on EVE so far, he's provided content for more than just a very small amount of players.
---
That's a huge chunk of money that could have gone towards a few of our nicer updates. Or, more likely, one of the failed mobile games. Still, it's the thought that counts.
---
something is off with this guy
---
I see,  I guess he enjoys playing the mouse
---
&gt;due to the aging game.i wuold say injectors
---
It still enables you to win when you couldn't.
---
Assuming equal skills, both in-game and in person, the guy with a 10b fit is much more likely to win over the guy with 100m fit.
---
And there is a point at which money does buy you wins. If Bill Gates were to say, "Fuck this humanitarian bullshit, I want me some EVE," and splurge his billions on creating an alliance that could field 10+ Titan fleets at any given point, he would win EVE. There's no debating that.
---
It would never happen, obviously. But you *can* pay to win.
---
so? it's still the polices job to come on the the premises and arrest them. your employer doesn't rock up with a pair of handcuffs and a badge.
---
I honestly think there needs to be a better community development mechanism in the game. 
---
Every new player is avoiding joining a corp, because that corp could be war decced. Next thing you know, they are playing solo, get bored, and quit.
---
Say the guys who hid while the fleet was at full strength, then sat a system over waiting until almost everything was dead before jumping in and claiming credit for the wrecks. That's just weak.
---
Out of curiosity, do you guys actually believe your spin or are some of you self-aware? I'm leaning towards the former.
---
TEST: why didn't you feed your fleet into our meme capital roam
---
Also TEST: we self destructed our meme capital roam because we didn't want to feed to frat
---
Ok
---
I'm gonna do this when I get a job.
---
This is a weird post. Took 500 dollars in spaceships to blow up some mining op, or am I missing something cos I really might be.
---
Like... Overwhelming force is cool when used against an equal. This is just jerking off.
---
That's interesting if we captusuler can use that ship would be so interesthings.
---
I mean, I knew BL was overrated, but this is the most obvious example of bottom-feeding I've seen in years. Even PanFam had the balls to take the fights -- granted they'd hide behind a hundred titans, but they at least showed up. You guys literally wimped out of fighting, waited until everything was dead or dying, then bragged on reddit that you'd dunked the fleet. That's a level of spin the Mittani can admire.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
TBH this looks like another good reason cyno mechanics need to be changed, not the capitals themselves.
---
I am pretty sure that if you could pay CCP directly for updates, they didn't need to sell PLEX
---
it's almost as if you were forced to join the imperium!

And you could do that without plex. Just with the slight chance of your account getting banned. 
---
Plex is the lesser of two evils imo. Its not ideal, but few solutions when policing not ideal people are.
---
You can still burn everything anchored in them.
---
Even better, you got showed up by **CVA** of all people. They had the balls to bring a muninn fleet and fight us head on (and did pretty well for themselves in the process).
---
This is one of the only replies I read that make sense.
---
I was in the same boat as the OP, had 5 accounts, then 4, on and on till I'm down 3 now and about to do 2 only ( the 2 I pay a sub for).  That damn PLEX TREADMILL is a horrible thing.
---
I got addicted to it back when plex was cheap. Ratting was relaxing and sometimes provided PvP content and let me save 30-45 bucks a month and I had plenty of isk left over for ships. That's what gets you hooked.
---
That's what got the op hooked. Like me he simply needs to let it go.
---
When the point is "capitals did not work" I think it is a valid point saying "there were not enough".
---
If you drop one bomb on a shield battleship fleet it does not mean bombers do not work against those. It means you did not bring critical mass. 
---
So yes, if bringing more capital logistic ships would have lead to the capitals winning the fight/being the correct answer there is a balance/design issue.
---
I don't really get it why he shuffled with the fighters like that instead of alpha-ing the damn rorqual... no panic available for rorq because no rocks to target, should had finished him off and kill the cyno... It was logic that capitals would jump on that cyno not frigates...
---
Or he has a super alt he keeps very quiet.
---
oh dear, he might tweet about you now.
---
thats a shame, lmao
---
tldr?

i feel like this was all planned by brave, "ge-" cant work anymore

Problem is enough isk for a  perfect titan can be obtained for a FRESH toon in less then 8 months with a songle rorqual

evan can I salvage behind your super

is this what karma looks like?

so whats the total haul?
---
Story time?
---
Big oof.
---
&gt; Assuming equal skills, both in-game and in person, the guy with a 10b fit is much more likely to win over the guy with 100m fit.
---
but will he win with a more than a 1000:1 ratio? because otherwise, he'd be better off just buying 1000 100m fits and taking that 50:50 chance of winning.
---
so is he really paying to win? because to me it just sounds like a really expensive way not to lose what's otherwise an easily replaceable hull, in a really cost ineffective way.
---
Ahahahahaha, amazeballs. More than makes up for all the smugging he did about the Kinakka keepstar.
---
You mean like.. an arena?
---
Do you really think that buying plex will save you when you get ganked or land in a bubble?
---
Do you really think that extra 5% dps will make a difference in a big fleet battle or the extra 5% ehp save you when your yellow boxed?
---
These are things that you either learn through experience or straight up have no control over... For everything else theirs MasterCard
---
Nah works at 711 and spends. His 11$/hr is direct deposited straight to ccp.
---
I hate waiting.... ;)
---
A wiki doesn't directly make revenue for CCP so they dgaf.   
---
Maybe if they charged access to it in the form of a plex subscription they'd become interested in maintaining one. /s
---
yeah but the gap between new and old players was an ever increasing chasm.
---
if anything, the solution should've been accelerators, not injectors.
---
an accelerator that gave say, +15 attributes under 5m sp, +10 under 30m, you get the pattern.
---
doesn't allow instant spawning of ready made characters but helps new players start to navigate their way across the yawing expanse between new and old.

If this thread doesn't just make you love evan more than idk what kind of eve player you are =\

Yeah this no big deal, he has his fun doing this, been doing it for years now. Its what he does!  Good on him.

And that day will be Feb. 30.

It's not a ruse. Doom has blocked a bunch of people on twitter to avoid being giggled at.
---
Over a Trillion looks like so far...

No, that comes later.

Shhhhhhhh get over it

Treats everyone like a dick, gets upset when it's done to him :thinking:

Doom is an attention whore with multiple sycophantic orbiters that will do his bidding. Don't be surprised if this is a ruse just to get people to say his name.
---
Care to explain, what the fuck apart from purple mods and AT ships we are looking at?
---
Fake or real?
---
Not sure yet.... Is anything real?
---
Or he can buy a nyx for 11b in delve
---
meme online
---
Never a dull moment in this game.
---
Poor doomgerbil :(
---
I'm from Canada to. Realistically. He has no gf. Doesn't spend much money on clothes. His main expense is probably food and rent. And he's probably making about $19 an hour seeing as overnight shift gets paid like 2 bucks more. So let's say 1300 per paycheque after tax. 500 plex is either 15 or 20 bucks. So yeah. It's easy to see where he can get the money.
---
You purposefully didn't go to Detorid because you didn't want to fight us, had a slap fight with CVA because you expected someone to brawl your capital roam, and then self destructed when someone even remotely threatening burned across two full regions to come fight you. I'm not sure you should be harping on about being scared to fight when you were pretty clearly petrified to go anywhere near someone who could actually fight you
---
 Click the X on the right side of the account name Remove account from list  
---
Then Add Accounts again
---
Having your blocked on twitter isn't indicative of anything other than a semi working brain.
---
It really isn't thought. He can realistically on his budget be dropping 300-500 a pay cheque if he doesn't spend much on anything else.
---
I'm calling a ruse cruise.
---
&gt; if anything, having multiple active omega accounts is way more pay to win than blinging out 1 ship.
---
Yeah, that's a great point. It's not something that gets brought up often in these discussions, but it's absolutely true. There are so many situations in EVE where having more than one account enables you to do a large amount of things that you couldn't have done otherwise.
---
Not real btw
---
Honestly most people in eve just sit around waiting for something to happen. More then Half the time They won’t engage unless the odds Are heavily stacked in their favor.  This means they sit and station spin doing nothing night after night, waiting for the perfect opportunity, all to protect their kB stats.  Evan plays a different game. He shoots everything, knowing that he is likely to die - just wanting the action, win or lose. He has always been that way. Nothing wrong with that at all.
---
Doom is a good man.
---
A minor annoyance for people with enough isk to buy most of it back probably
---
*you blocked
---
aar pl0x
---
Yeah they said it was intended and the way it worked before was a bug. Like not even joking lmao.
---
Thanks for the interesting responses.  I am liking this game quite a bit and just had this thought because in reality no matter what people are saying here if there was a server that was introduced today with exactly what I put people would jump into it.  Even if that server required a subscription to join people would flock I think. I'm not saying the company doesn't deserve our money I'm saying a server with an actual progression would be very interesting to see.
---
It's overnight shift so it's $2+ an hour. If he's been there a while realistically he could be looking at 17-19 an hour
---
&lt;3
---
Minimum wage is 15 an hour plus we makes more for working overnight. So 11 isn't close.
---
So because youre known to blob on a consistent basis, other groups have to call friends on a consistent basis, but suddenly when your batphone doesn't show up, it's their fault for adapting to your playstyle

Links to the in-game tutorial videos being on the career agent mission offers should be a thing.

Yeah, well, doesn't help for your post to make sense to me.

Burn to tower, cycle prop mod once.

Thanks, I've been doing nonstop school work for the last week, literally.

And sure, send them over, I'll take a look into it!
---
&gt; One could argue that he only provided content and fun for a very small amount of players.
---
How many people do *you* provide content for?
---
What even is your point? That you don't get advantages from buying isk? 
---
You obviously do, and denying that fact is just dumb. I'm personally fine with how much of an advantage you get vs the trade off of being able to plex accounts and providing ccp with another revenue source.
---
yes they responded
---
they said it was a bug fix and an intentional change, it was never meant to require less than 3 alpha numeric character
---
i'm not joking
---
It had something to do about a different coding language that didn't count hyphens as a letter
---
\&gt; Can only be flown in Null
---
Despite what people may be saying. Really envy the lack of care Evan has for EVE assets. Most of us, I feel would not risk our caps YOLO'ing into places like this, no matter even if had 1 Tril in liquid ISK.
---
He has fun and enjoys this. I say by all means let him. Creates content, lets other people actually see someone flying a cap without a super umbrella on the other side of a cyno.
---
Admittedly he may not have the best social skills, but he is still a decent person who's just looking to enjoy the world we all love. I say thumbs up to the guy, altough he could probably refresh a lesson or two on opsec intel (stream filters) and few key mechanics.
---
Hey, its the only dude in eve worse than Doom! strange to see you in this post
---
So if a rape is happening you just walk right by without saying anything right because its the cops job to stop crime not yours?
---
Mine does. I don't do propaganda in Eve *because* I'm a pro. When my fingers are on the keyboard, someone's writing me a check.
---
no, but he reports the crime, and calls the police.  if he were a goon he would just throw up his hands and be like "WELL ITS NOT MY JOB TO CATCH THE BAD GUYS COPS GET CALLED FOR THAT".
---
Sounds like he's got a real addiction in that case. Hope he can get the help to turn it around, can't see how anyone could find that lifestyle fulfilling.
---
All of those are (were) assets belonging to the corporation CynoU in Pandemic Legion, lead by DoomChinchilla, a prominent personality in EVE. OP stole all of it and is currently selling it live on stream.
---
he's still in corp [https://i.imgur.com/XkLjuZL.png](https://i.imgur.com/XkLjuZL.png)
---
Eve - &gt;was&lt;- supposed to be hardcore space sandbox mmo, where the only thing that realy matters is whether you understand and therefor like it, or not, now look what it turned into, is the "new" Eve any good? I don't think so, as for the new/old players, well, same should apply to that as well.

Needless to say that I personally couldnt give less shits than i already do about mongoloids who operate on the "something for nothing" principles. So i cannot agree on any suggestions that make Eve easier in any way.
---
Any change favouring new incomming people is very unfair to old players - like me i have to admit -, who worked hard over the years for everything we have.
---
but he is still in corp?  [https://i.imgur.com/XkLjuZL.png](https://i.imgur.com/XkLjuZL.png)

Somehow that would put doom in a worse light than being actually robbed, truly sick if true
---
Big things not sold for offers more than they are worth does sound a bit fishy.
---
How long does it take to run a TCRC with a super fleet?
---
no u
---
I would do it. I strongly suggest joining a corp thats been around so that you get educated in the rich and lucius history of wormholes. Also you get a feel for what you can get away with.
---
With that note I’m also making a pirate mission runner on an alt.
---
HaHa
---
This man speaks the truth
---
Eve hits a different market and it’s success depends upon catering to its niche.
---
It's all fun and games to be like "oh, look at that fit, wtf, etc" but like in all honesty, I hope someone is showing him how to properly use a dread, etc.
---
You can't instantly kick a pilot with any roles, there is a 24h stasis.
---
Bingo. I recall mining into a jetcan with Rokh while someone else did badger runs. 
---
Shit... That was something like 12 years ago... Oh fuck i'm almost 40.
---
Need to wait a day after removing roles before you can kick someone
---
remove titles and roles?  still has a title?
---
He "Accidentally" sold the whiptail for 245m instead of 245b, despite having rejecting a bunch of these scam contracts earlier
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/BoxyArtisticTurtleStinkyCheese

he still has a title though?  guess time will tell
---
Whay-0. This guys is shoulder surfing me in my office at work. Thats VBA you see, but what you don't see is my client running remotely beneath it!

And to think they said when I was hired I can't have two jobs at once...

So dumb

I'm surprised there's not more outrage about this. This is a "little things" feature I thought more people would complain about.

Sorry OP YTA.

Wait shit wrong sub.

wait shit its also not unpopular opinion

Wormholes man

yeah could be that to but unless it was fresh it would off be reported ti,
---
Thank you to the TEST and select few wormhole bros for doing Bob’s work.
---
&gt;if there was a server that was introduced today with exactly what I put people would jump into it
---
I wish that was the case so TQ would finally get rid of all the unneccesary junk, unfortunately its not the case.
---
mfw a cry for help from an entire corp
---
A pic of total haul would be nice...just saying...
---
AND SO THE ANTI-VNI BOT REVOLUTION BEGINS
---
Everyone needs a role model
---
VNI TO THE BLOOD GOD!
---
Jita is a great place to run if you aren't blinged. There are so many people running there, and sec status isn't free. And as yet, there have been no "Burn Jita Abyssal Runners" events. You will tend to be left alone. And if someone ganks your T2 fit, it tends to set them just as far back as you.
---
As soon as you have bling so that baddies can expect to come out ahead in ISK blowing your ass up - I don't know how you would feel comfortable in Jita.
---
stealing cynos is a thing now?
---
Title and Roles are different things, they just get displayed in the same row/next to each other.
---
"Title" is a free form text field into which you can write whatever you want, it has no gameplay effect/no mechanics associated to it.
---
Yo. I’m sorry to be the one to break it to tou. That’s $3,000 a month or $36,000 a year on the top end. 
---
And that’s in canadian. One canadian is only $0.74 USD. At best he’s pulling $14 usd an hour.
---
I’m not saying thats poverty level. But it’s literally the poverty level where I live. I make a sliver more Idk If I could budget something like that and be okay with myself.
---
You gotta like consider rent is gotta be at least about $750-1k (ridiculously low where I live) + food $400ish plus like car /Insurance. 
---
The best value of PLEX, 15400 is $500 and sells for 60BIL isk.
---
Thats like. Not that much isk guys.
---
Thats still more than what I spend for food and would only give you about 5Nyx hauls &amp;12Bil ea. 
---
🚨 🚨 Dave Ramsey would not approve. 🚨 🚨 
---
https://youtu.be/XkVQ2iehRms
---
I’m not saying he has a video game addiction. But he potentially spends 10 times as much on PLEX as I do on mu cannabis addiction.
---
..... can you get them to change it back
---
They can, but will they?
---
It’s better than sitting on a mountain of ISK not doing anything. At least he’s having fun!
---
Bob giveth, Bob taketh, Bob mineth the salt.
---
Roles and titles are not the same thing, they just look like it from the outside. You can instantly kick someone with title, but not roles.
---
Not that I really paid much attention to the stream, but the guy seems to be AFK right now. People in chat saying the titan pilot got the access to the corp hangars back.
---
Do you pass on them if they are not bots?
---
&gt; this massively multiplayer game is better now because of QoL improvements even though noone is actually left playing it. who cares about content when you can multibuy from NPCs? Nostalgia goggles, amirite bois?! haha
---
Nope cause most of us could not afford to flat in fleets
---
He had roles, that means there's a 24h timer on him being able to be kicked. Don't be fooled by the title, tho. Titles don't do that, but look like roles from the outside.
---
Hell I expected it
---
All he said is that ISK doesn't neccesarily make you BETTER pilot, which is true. You cannot realy buy ISK in eve directly, the only way is to buy plex for cash and sell it to people who are dumb enough to buy it, thats all.
---
Whether you work a hour longer in real life or rather nolife eve 24/7 is entirely up to people. The first is for lazy people or people who dont have huge amount of free time at their disposal, second is for those who do. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Military experts are saying this is "fake and gay"
---
While killing the bots is great, it's really just a band aid on a bullet wound. Those vni's are going to be easily replaced and the bots will be back out there ratting the second that the hunters leave.
---
Already asked, got the response as above.
---
how do you manage to kill them? dont they warp off when a neut enteres system
---
&gt; I’m not saying thats poverty level. But it’s literally the poverty level where I live.
---
He doesn't live where you live though.
---
After continued farming, yes. After a while I feel kind of bad. Some dude afk-ing in a VNI is much different from a botter with their army of alts. Just make sure you say “thank you for not botting” after you kill the dude.
---
Hell yeah, live for that shit.
---
Could be a ruse, could be he avoids docking and thus getting kicked from corp.
---
And now we see Doom looking for attention again. pathetic isnt it?
---
Get baited nerds
---
Wouldn't have happened in OE.
---
You're not serious right, like 2 days late and that's all you got for an aar?
---
:)
---
 I threw around a few ideas a while back with mates
---
- have an audio cue similar to when some one enters and leaves a discord channel 
---
- a visual cue aswell for people with hearing problems or people playing with no sound, like your overview changes color for a moment and the icon of the gate that was activated flickers briefly.
---
That or have the amount of players in system integrated into the D-Scan, you hit D-scan and you get the usual info but also get a total of capsuleer signatures in system which shows up near the the scan range and angle bars. It would picks up everyone, even in stations etc regardless whether they're in scan range or not. 
---
Anyway, it's one of the few things that keeps me playing eve more than I currently do.
---
That doesn’t make sense in relation to my comment at all, nice try though.

Hello there! I am a bot raising awareness of Alpacas

 Alpacas come in at least twenty two natural colors, depending on who you ask the number goes higher. They come in more natural colors than any other animal.

It is awesome and the main catchpoint for a lot of players, for example, me.

&gt; the best isk/hr grind will always be a minimum wage job irl
---
my isk/hour is better than the minimum wage job here though.
---
Sorry for your loss mate. Would love to know how it went down from your side of things.
---
No, but if Mr Ramsey recommends people who live in much cheaper areas making more spend less on frivolous things. I’m still going to say $500 a month sounds a bit disproportionately high. But that is an arbitrary number. He could be spending less monthly and just be long term saving(his twitch clips appear to indicate he’s an impulsive PLEX buyer though).
---
So, INIT, we suck. Orion did in 5 minutes what we could never do. Collapsed Out robbed of everything. Orion has taken Doom down more than we could ever have dreamed of. #tweetfleet #NoCollusion
---
This is a level of toxicity hitherto unbeknownst to me.

More structures? I have not read anything about new structures.

Well, if one needs proof, that this thing is staged... then here it is.

Soooooooo. A thinly veiled structure bash?

Good bot

You must not know Evan if you are suggesting that he drop 1v50 on Provi for a change of pace. That is what he did for the last year.

is it just me or besides the AT ships + injectors the loot seems to be pretty weak?

Dude. 750 to 1 grand for rent? Rent is 400-500 in most places in Canada.

Its almost like we found that out last week :P 
---
https://i.imgur.com/03GXnGa.png
---
Exactly. This guy is quoting 750-1k for rent a month. Rent in Canada for alot of places is 400-500 and I know some who with enough roommates are sub 400.
---
100% sure that's one of his own alts
---
So you're crying about a Triglavian structure which they'll likely use to invade us with. Where does it state that it will be available to players?
---
Bubble and log off traps seem to be the most effective. Also these bots in particular have a fast reset. Typically you can find their site, leave local, come back after a few minutes and they’re out again.
---
There's more than enough how to start eve guides, but I always disagree with the fact a new player should look to join another player run corporation asap. You should find your own way, not fall in line with someone elses, unless that's what you want.
---
Alright america #1 the best number system, commas for thousands digit grouping and periods for decimals. Fuck you i'm done being amicable now.
---
Sure but that doesn't mean we shouldn't kill them.
---
WAIT so they made it so if I search for say B-5 it doesn't work? this explains why i have been so confused.
---
Yeah sorry not out to be a dick. But yeah. I was trying to say it might be possible. I feel a little bit sorry for the guy because he's devoting so much of his net worth and happiness to this game. And don't get me wrong. I love this game. But having a life outside it really helps with your overall happiness
---
well, the supercap market in delve was getting a bit slow anyways
---
What really is needed is for everyone to awox bots/not tolerate anyone using them. if there is no space to bot in...
---
"Players can make all these things and blow them up!"
---
"But if they blow them up, no-one will know they exist..."
---
"Don't worry, we'll make it so there's no reason to blow them up and then everyone will love us"
---
And then the whole of New Eden stood up and clapped.

It means ccp should actually fucking do something

Rent in Vancouver is around 800-1k a month but that's probably the most expensive in Canada.

Adapt or die (or whine).
---
Well, guess we're burning jita down again.
---
I'm saying with roommates though. 800 for 2 bedroom. 1200 for 3 bedroom. With roommates that's around 400 each. I don't know if 5his guy has roommates though
---
Of course it is. And its huge and has 40k pilots in it, so Im sure there are tons.

Eve only needs so many minerals.

Hold up you don't think the isk that you get comes out of thin air do you? Or that the modules/ships that you buy come from ccp right?
---
Bloody good show everyone o7
---
how can you tell the difference between an AFK vni and a botting vni. dont they both do nothing when caught?
---
Mop bucket for the skull throne! It's sticky.
---
You can get off your knees now he let you in. Jesus.
---
There are people out there playing every day. You just gotta find the right group. It's a tough pill to swallow. Unless you just want other groups like the null blocs who own vast empty spaces to give it up or fight eachother instead of krab. That won't happen.
---
STICKY WITH THE DRONES THAT NOW HAVE NO MASTER.

FOR THEY BEEN ADDED INTO MY COLLECTION HAHAHA.

&gt; Meh, say about Snuff what you want, they definitely regularly take fights outnumbered... in lowsec, using slaved BS, with FAX, vs cruisers, and init standing by.

Dude has fun playing a game. Maybe he doesnt have any other epxenses or maybe he just enjoys eve. I know dudes who throw easily 300 a month into gambling on sports. They dont have a "problem" its their hobby. He spends it on eve. When i played paintball i could easily spend 400 in a day at an event. On paint....dudes spends his money on what he enjoys doing. Cant hate him for that. 
---
If u do...u need to reevaluate what u spend ur money on.
---
THERE ARE NO BOTS IN PB, WE DO NOT APPRECIATE THIS CLEAR PANFAM PROPAGANDA, SYSTEMS AVAILABLE FOR RENT, CONTACT SADUS IN GAMEIEORNGBINEOMWWRTWTNR!!!!!!!
---
yikes
---
They are, by replacing it with The Army of Mango Alliance!
---
thats sad to hear, especially after all the work ccp does in making sure they treat you right.
---
AFK vni will keep spinning with drones out and prop mod still on while orbitting the site.
---
Bots will recall, align, and warp the very SECOND you enter local
---
Maybe CCP invested heavly in Dotlan stocks?
---
You can’t really. Unless the pilot does something obvious when they come back to the keyboard like scream for help in local/change direction abruptly/pull drones. It’s hard to tell the difference.
---
cynou is EBIC funny trolLE xD
---
I dropped out of my wh in G-Q5JU today and can say there were quite a few VNIs there mate
---
Yes. Your 16 years of memorization of system names with 2 letters and a hyphen goes down the trash because "it was a bug"
---
i said when caught.
---
though i guess they would still recall drones and then do nothing
---
TEST pretending to be against botters when they aren't making them taxes.
---
&gt;init have done this to test for the last 2 weeks also. 
---
we have?
---
That answer is probably a straight up lie and they don't know what really happened.
---
The thing is Rekrab is not nearly as bad as Evan.
---
They are. As we speak they are hard at work making exclusive "VNI Bot Hunter" skins. Not only do you get to do their job for them, you get to pay them extra for looking good while doing it!
---
I.e. we don't know what caused it and we don't have the resources to find out.
---
Just look at the NPC killed heat map on dotlan. Odds are that any area that lights up visibly above the rest is overrun by bots.
---
Look at the names on these chars, not even trying to be discreet
---
He is a true eve hero imo 0 Fs given. Press f to him
---
About time some VNIs got holocausted.
---
CCP can't intervene yet; his card is still clearing charges. Once that changes tho, they'll be right on it.
---
its okay guys, rent from goons, they don't like it when you report goon bots. Goons will let you bot in peace.
---
GE-8JV is one of the few systems I can do the whole name of by memory in null

Completely disagree with the OP.  
---
Super/titan proliferation has all but ruined EvE. Anything that makes life harder for supers and titans is a good thing.  
---
If you want that type of content, take gates and be prepared to use SUBCAPITALS to peel the waterboarding dictors with instalockers.  
---
If your in FRT you've been enjoying some of the best content in EvE for the last month. No idea what you could possibly be complaining about.
---
Congrats on finishing your degree, by the by!
---
It's because rats are really bad at targeting drones, even if they're not able to damage the ship. Any player in that scenario primaries the drones to clear DPS, and if rats did that, it would be more balanced and would encourage people to use things other than just drone boats.
---
Nobody cares if isk makes you a better pilot or not, isk just literally gets you a % increase, which makes plex p2w.
---
It makes some people feel better about their own mediocrity to shit on others.
---
To be fair... Rapid Torp is so short range that I sometimes want to put on cruise missiles... Pls make Rapid Cruise missile launcher a thing..
---
I'm glad someone realized this wasn't a serious post.
---
fuck \o/ snuff \o/
---
&gt;peel the waterboarding dictors with instalockers.
---
Good fucking luck with that: source, am dictor pilot who knows how the cloak works.
---
Well, that is a proper meme-boat at least :D
---
Obvious ruse... else someone didn't like having to do their gifs.
---
I agree however the cyno jammer changes have also made it harder for sub-cap fleets and the citadel mechanics make using sub-caps to grind structures fucking mind-numbing.
---
If you want to tackle super proliferation, making it risky to use them would do better than stopping people be able to attack each other.
---
Supers have bombs. Capitals have SBs. Booshers....   
---
Once again, there is a solution to every waterboarding based problem.
---
For the same reason that those that complain about Eve mechanics the loudest are the ones that no longer play.  :thonking:
---
Well CCP ain't doing shit!
---
Grinding into citadels are a problem, yes. However I'm more interested in tackling the problem with a surgical knife, not a meat cleaver.  Supers are actively being used on the war front as we speak. No one is denying them use. A quick look at Zkill will provide you all the proof you need.
---
&gt;ppl making 76k should only be spending $50 a month on fun.
---
are you an actual retard?
---
&gt; I'm saying with roommates though.
---
no you weren't
---
I'd still pull my heavies and try to drop lights if caught
---
Nah. The way they wanted to play the game made sense only with nonselective recruiting.
---
And their hateful culture persists and is very much disseminated top-down taking many of the generic linemembers inside. Just watch boat and mittens on INN for an hour to see how obnoxious they still are. 
---
Hell even their fleet pings are hateful.
---
After seeing the high slots, I was genuinely impressed that T2 made it into the mid/low slots!
---
It is closer to that number in USD.
---
When the guy posted about these dudes being in horde, his primary complaint was that he got no response from the leadership. This time he posted straight to reddit. If change is what he was seeking, it was doubtful that hed get any.
---
Symbolically, an npc entity would attack space a faction or capsuleer alliance has sov over.
---
Why "attack" or invade space that no one controls.
---
Agreed razer poor aar my groups not even mentioned 😂😂
---
thats fair.
---
ive also seen people just give up when caught. hard to tell that from a bot.
---
They are the cheapest faction battleships already.
---
The content has been great yes but bad mechanics are still bad. I am not saying make it easy as fuck to bring supers and titans where ever you want. Keep in mind you can have up to 3 of these things in any system. 
---
10min is not an unreasonable time with a damage cap and is still a MASSIVE buff over the old versions. In old wars you could do it in 1min... 27min to kill one structure is insane. I believe making it doable would create more conflict and explosions not less. AND if ccp is so concerned about massive changes they could at least bring it down a little bit 15min/20min you know iterations they were talking about.
---
typical programmer’s arrogance, user would like a feature that improves user experience but programming “limitations” won’t let us do it. I wonder if any of those programmers even play the game because if they did they would understand where us users are coming from.
---
 Stfu u nob
---
All that sounds pretty reasonable, but also ask yourself if 10m notice is enough to send pings, form fleet, undock, get to grid and defend.  
---
I will say I'm not a fan of shooting the cyno jammer to place the repair time sequence into motion, but I'm not aware of a good solution to it. Repairing jammers (POS days) was aids, and kill them and replacing them when damaged was also AIDS. Don't want to move in a regressive direction.
---
Glad you showed examples of what you are talking about...
---
Only 5 supers though. Iant there a guy who has lost 8 titans?
---
What the fuck?
---
Ahahahahahaha I guess you are sadly back
---
I'm on a fixed income of similar values. Living in southern California and I gotta say there arbet many pennies left over after all the Bill's are paid. It's a shit life.
---
1750 for a 2 bedroom apartment where I'm at.
---
Sorry to say you've missed all of it. It was 170 frigs vs. a fleet of almost 100 caps and they've won.
---
Kicking those shitheads wasn't out of reach for PH's possibilities, it seems. 
---
Maybe it's asked too much of huge alliances to police all their systems, all the time. But if there is one guy botting with multiple accounts all day and they get a report from their members who are bothered by it, kicking them should be a no-brainer.
---
It just means you are jumping subs into their super/cap fleet through a gate, so half your subs won't load the grid. It's just not possible to take one like you propose.
---

While this is a good idea, it also shifts the problem to the imagehost. Not every host stays alive or will keep your image stored forever.
---
I know this will be unpopular, but what is to be gained from banning bots? They won't be replaced by real players, it will just remove the illusion of a busier nulsec.
---
Plex would go down, which is great if you want to Plex but rubbish if you want to sell Plex, which would surely mean less people selling plexx and the price going back up.
---
Not to mention the loss of earnings for ccp, even if bots don't pay real money, someone had to, that's how Plex works.

man, feel like an idiot CCing my membership and spending in-game time working for my isk while 1000s of others just get it for free afk no effort.
---
Check the br I posted below it has proper fleets lined up
---
The problem isn't the ships, it's the cynos and the fact you can jump all you want no problem. Caps should deploy slowly, none of this push button 2 seconds later 50 billion supers arrive. And then they can jump again in what, a few minutes?
---
This is the BR with the proper teams
---
Assist your drones to AAA, snipers focus tags A-Z, dps tags 1-9.

Problem is there will always be a place for them, Some CEO will allow it because of ISK
---
I blame the venusian reptiles of Mars as well. No proof whatsoever, but trust me.
---
*laughs in Fed Def LP*
---
It's not even a station, it's the ark ship.
---
Maybe it’ll scale damage against other structures with no damage cap
---
Don't be toxic. This is an equal opportunity sub reddit
---
You realise half this stuff was probably donated by cucks like Sort trying to buy friendship, right.
---
Only NPCs get to enjoy the real things nice things in eve
---
CCP-US is the other for me
---
Depends on the bot. I once caught one that kept launching and scooping its drones while sitting still.
---
It's not so much as what we gain by killing bots as what we lose by keeping bots. Bots are an ISK faucet that contribute to inflation and the N+1 nullsec meta, and give an unfair advantage over honest player who actually put in the time to play the game.
---
Please fix CCP

Shhh...  my VNI profits are through the roof.

110 plex is cheaper per unit than 2200. 880 plex is more expensive per unit than 440. 440 plex is a stupid number and costs nearly double the cost of a monthly sub. There doesn't seem to be any logic to any of it until you add the free plex.
---
If you work out the price per unit for the packs with and without the free plex it only sorts in the right order with the free plex in the price. It's a scam and it's a dick move
---
sometimes its look like, we also have cool thing that its not utilize at the major extent.
---
weird
---
Props to you mate for bringing it up here. I am also concerned that they will eventually break the game and force a big chunk of the player base to wuit. Talking about it is the only thing we can do but i fear it wont make much of a difference.
---
That is assuming maximal efficiency. If the 'paint' was applied by say, stuffing the donors into a cannon and splattering them on the side, much like am oversized paintball gun, the number could be significantly higher.
---
And with a proper loading mechanism, I posit that the ballistic method would be far more time efficient.
---
Where tho
---
TBH this is the best argument for a Killboard from CCP that I've ever heard.
---
Sorry I'm kinda confused, what does VNI stand for?

Vexor Navy Issue
---
Vexor Navy Issue. The Navy faction variant of the Vexor.
---
Vexor Navy Issue, one of the best ships to afk rat with in Nullsec.

Just ignore the "free" bullshit. The price is for the total.  CCP is far from the only company that trots out that nonsense.  (Which doesn't make it better)
---
There's no bots in goon space.
---
Nuh uh. 
---
You're just imagining it. 
---
That killboard is fake news.
---
True but  I would not be happy using it on tiny ass bombers.
---
Now that’s Minmatar thinking right there
---
Any MMO will have a min/max setup, eve and eve players just take it to the next level.

How are you catching them

It should show on the overview. Make sure you have spare space on the overview to the right which gives you room for it.

geez, you know people are desperate when they try to spin any new content into some asset safety/damage cap/cyno/rorqual/garmur nullifier bs
---
Thats not that much, really. I wouldve expected i to be a lot higher
---
The bots are alpha
---
First time hearing this coming from a goon :D
---
They don't care, you don't need to search systems to run assbyssmal derpspace!
---
But cyno jammers don't make life harder for all supers just the attacking ones, the defending ones get to sit on the jammer and pop sub caps without any real threat being presented to them.
---
Its also the Caldari way of dealing with prople wjo default on their loans

Every corp makes a medal. Every 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 etc... bot kills nets the next level of medal.
---
You give a prize to the guy who kills the most bots, some people will go apeshit for that. How is that sustainable in the long term for the botters? Every minute they’re not sucking on roids is revenue lost. If they are continuously harassed that’s not sustainable. Who wants to do that the whole time?

that's quite the conservative timeframe

Also null is just too big, anywhere outside the densest regions like Geminate and Delve a botter can be legitimately unnoticed since no one's around, especially if they're not dumb enough to do the 23/7 thing and make themselves obvious via wallet ticks.
---

---
&gt; Oh shit I got called an f1 monkey by the test guy :yikes:

yeah that explains your comments.
---
There is a clean and simple change, but it requires courage on the part of CCP and the players.
---
So, just doing the math (Including the "Free Plex, cause thats just a lie) 
---
This is all in USD btw  
---
110 plex at 4.99 USD = 4.536364 cents per 1 plex. 
---
240 plex at 9.99 USD =  4.1625 cents per 1 plex.
---
500 plex at 19.99 USD = 3.998 cents per 1 plex.
---
1100 plex at 39.99 USD =  3.635455 cents per 1 plex. 
---
2860 plex at 99.99 USD =  3.496154 cents per 1 plex.
---
&gt; Tri position themselves as a non-blob PvP-seeking alliance who are happy to fight anyone anywhere
---
????????????????????????
---
&gt;You telling me they are not that and in fact they are just another "we won't fight outnumbered" semi-PvP alliance as all others?
---
???????????????????
---
is this some out of game bait op, it must be
---
Actually they had been seeding those supers there for almost a year!
---
Those shield boosters are actually cruiser size, battleships use XLarge
---
Or just alpha it with 50 Titans
---
Its true, that Goonswarm has said in the past "We aren't here to ruin the game, just your game" but I am not my alliance. I fight with them, and I give my  loyalty to them, but I am not them. I am me, and I believe that all should enjoy this game and all of what it has to offer.
---
&gt; Repairing jammers (POS days) was aids, and kill them and replacing them when damaged was also AIDS. Don't want to move in a regressive direction.
---
Yeh, it used to be aids for the defenders. Now it's done a 180 and is aids for the attackers.
---
I for one welcome our new Triglavian overlords.
---
eh don't worry about it, shit happens
---
Most VNI bots warp to a safe spot as soon as someone enters the system. Looks like the bot failed
---
There are few things I get really annoyed about, but this "bug fix" is a darn tootin pain in the derriere! Excuse my language, I am very passionate about this. CCP can you bug fix your common sense.
---
The attacking supers can still go through the gate. Does it take longer to bring those heavy assets to bare... yes, yes it does-- and I'm ok with that.
---
Yes.
---
It's called USB Tethering in the Settings Menu, should be in the same place as where you would turn on Wifi hotspot from the settings menu.
---
We saw how well that doesn't work with the vale defense, all the defending supers, titans and subs sit on the in gate and you have to jump into a firing squad and allow the entire enemy fleet to shoot you while you wait for the grid to load. Its beyond a "home" advantage its a guaranteed win for the defender
---
I love you.
---
[Crazy Mouseee](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113809580/), the hero we don't deserve.
---
Not at all, alpha makes you train slower, omega trains faster no matter if you pay cash or use plex, so not a question of isk, but account status which you can change by paying with money, not just isk, so i dont see a problem, there are 2 options, not just isk. Not to mention plex was here waaaay before free2play.
---
You are confusing the objective. That was a timed objective, taking out a jammer is not. You may attack the jammer when you see fit and stay in that system as long as you see fit. The second/third timer on the Sotiyo had a clear time frame to attack.  We are discussing jammers in this thread.
---
Congratulations on your blob.

Didn’t say I was using the official app. Just using a mobile app for Reddit.
---
For real.
---
That's because they were all built with the free part being part of the base. They just split some off and call it free as part of a psychological manipulation.
---
and people still trust these tards to deliver on...well, anything
---
Everyone told them the new jammers were pants on head retarded before they even launched.  CCP, being literally retarded, went ahead with it, as per usual.  Now sov is even more stagnant than ever.  
---
But hey, they're releasing more Assbyssmal crap, ALL PRAISE CCP!
---
You only think its "great" being in FRT because people are bashing their head against the broken mechanics and getting you tons of free content.  Its terrible for the actual game though, as people are realizing how broken they are and are beginning to just say fuckit, not worth the time.
---
To assert your dominace
---
Security the space doesn't matter you can still bot in high sec, I'll be a bit it's probably a different kind of botting but still botting is botting
---
Over space that no one controls, or has sov over... no.
---
If you honestly think that's a solution, you're either a turbo troll or have no idea how the game works.  Locking down a defensive gate VS offensive caps in a cynojammed system is trivial.  Best case they lose the timer, worst case they get fucked on gate because the defenders can have their super fleet waiting + pre-bubblefuck said gate.
---
And he seeded no less than 5 reddit accounts
---
You apparently missed entire months of my posting history if you think that I'm only arguing for things that benefit me in the short term. Once again, TAPI and friends can take a gate and attack at any time they want. Those gates do not have a standing super fleet on the other side to oppose you. Jammers can be attacked whenever the attackers want. Literally at a whim. If you going to accuse people of baseless bias than I can literally do the exact same thing to those on the other side, it's easy.  "Hey TAPI wants to get around jammers, so look how conviently they are arguing against them!"
---
It took a friend explaining to me what hot/cold was and how the AB activation gets around mass limits. Could not find or missed anything in any rolling guides that went into that.
---
To be fair rekrab frags stuff non-stop and more than likely funds his stuff with in-game riches.
---
You seem overly involved in a hypothetical
---
Been around since 2012, most of that time has been in nullsec. You're right, I'm just here to troll you. /s  
---
As I've already stated multiple times now. This isn't a hellcamp scenario. There is no opposing super fleet on the other side of the gate. That simple. There is no timer that prevents you from preplacing a TAPI super fleet in any system they so desire. Please actually consider what people are saying before you accuse them of trolling. It's one thing to disagree, but must all conversation devolve to childish name calling?
---
tbf so will players who are paying any attention too XP
---
Look, there is a clear logic, you just don't seem to see it... This is not a scam and is extremely transparent standard working practices for most businesses, rounding numbers up or down to make them more easily digestible by customers.
---
Looking at the UK Plex store the price for plex is rounded up to .49 or .99 (above the initial £4.24), this does lead to a very slight depreciation of the base plex but it is easily compensated for by the 'Free' Plex.
---
CCP could charge you the £33.92 for you 880 Plex but they would be well within their rights to give you less bonus plex to compensate. Ether way we are talking pennies worth of difference here. I don't see how you could see this as a scam or dishonest as in all cases the more you spend the more plex you get per £.
---
Look at it this way, in each tier you get more free plex so that each time you look at the next pack you undeniably get more Plex per pound they then round up the number to a more industry standard model and what do you know, you still get more Plex per pound. You're not losing out in any way, 
---
Feel free to correct me if your local store differs.
---
Eve will run on a toaster...

---
Well, he hasn't lost a titan yet
---
Good to see you posting again, we were getting worried after all those pings.

Eh?
---
&gt;Security the space doesn't matter you can still bot in high sec
---
Botting violates the New Halaima Code of Conduct, I think.
---
250 and 500?
---
You seem overly involved in suggesting wormhole space has sovereignty.
---
Just bring twice as many subs that way the half that somehow get to load can wipe out the defenders, anti-fighter to deal with the inevitable carrier wave from the carriers on a on-grid citadel with the gate, special counters to waterboarding, oh and the counter to the defending subcap fleet, a counter to the jammer's citadel, if they're haw dreads on the gate, a counter to them as well. I'm absolutely sure in my naivete there's more but I know it can be done....somehow. 
---
What's good for the defender is what's good for the game. That way we can all farm in peace to achieve our goals of um, more peace.
---
I fell like this was an elaborate ruse to get us to do his math homework
---
Lol. They're literally identical to jump bridges before jump fatigue. CCP re-colored an old feature that we had for years and gave it back.
---
&gt;The attacking supers can still go through the gate. 
---
No, you usually can't.
---
Aye I did that too "eh better start buying a new one while I die". Warp to station, jump into fresh VNI, undock.
---
I'm not sure who told you that, or why you believe that. If there is no standing fleet on the other side, and you have super/titan superiority both on grid and in total number, please explain to me why you say that.
---
Get some1 like eve-uni hosting a killboard.
---
Well see, goons had our own KB for a while and it's gone now cause they guy who maintained it left, so even though the org is stable the actual KB itself quickly became run down and outdated. It's very hard to find someone else to take over another person's passion project.
---
#BUT FRAT
---
Us being here commenting and reading about the event is not providing us with content?
---
Because you can't just warp supers into fights and expect not to land in bubbles somewhere you don't want to be and die horribly.
---
Because you can't bring I reinforcement fax.
---
Because you can't being in reinforcement anything for that matter.
---
Because you can't leave your super fleet in some random system for a week waiting for a timer and respond to the other shit you need a super fleet for.
---
Basically, because you can't. The fact that you can't understand that is disappointing.
---
So wouldn't than mean you're killing AFKers whilst leaving botters unharmed?
---
That's why you penalize corps and alliances for harboring bots. If it costs them money to sit and make tax isk from their bots all day, suddenly they'll be a lot less welcoming instead of posting botting guides to their alliance.
---
You say that, but it was a mercy killing. The GSF killboard was a mutant freak of nature that makes Eve players look like Adonis by comparison. It was so, so bad.
---
That being said, it was the only place that had my killmails for the original Gallente ice interdiction, so all kidding aside, it does suck that it's gone.

Just got a 4k screen after giving in eventually lol ,
---
show us on the vni where the wormholer touched you.
---
There's no point to taking out the jammer if it's not a timed objective. The goal isn't to kill the jammer. The goal is to kill the thing the jammer is protecting. If you just randomly kill a jammer, they'll drop more. If you drop your own, it's a pain in the dick to defend, as seen on the IAS hub timer. Therefore, you do in fact need to go into the timed objective.
---
Boo hoo hurt feelings etc etc maybe go post on tumblr about it bro
---
Generally there is a fleet on the other side, because the opponents aren't stupid and can see you have a super fleet coming to the timer.
---
R/didthemath
---
I'm pretty sure that E-Uni has a killboard.
---
Probably pulled a raven fit apart and threw it on his first dread.
---
Ok, so you attack a jammer, it dies, you now need to have a 24/7 watch ensuring no jammer ever gets placed down until the hostile structure has gone through all three structures, taking up to over a week. If you really think a week+ 24/7 camp is a reasonable game balance decision to be able to attack a single structure then I dunno what you're smoking. It gets even worse if it's a sov timer, because now you need to camp every system in the constellation 24/7. That's not viable, it just leads to everyone burning out.
---
Ok so let's take a deep breath and work through some of those situations.  
---
1) Bring your FAX with your super fleet, why are you splitting them--that doesn't follow the flow of the current meta. If you need more, you gate them and peel with sub capital pilots. Once again, insta lockers, booshers, bombs, SBs, all handle bubble fucking.   
---
2) Why can't you bring in reinforcements? You didn't explain that at all.  
---
3) This is your most valid point, but then again, it's about risk reward, how much do you want to invest in your offensive push knowing that it may make you vulnerable? Sounds like the type of risk and reward mechanics that make EvE such a compelling and interesting game. Also who said it needs to be a week? Why not a day, 12 hours, 6 hours?  
---
4) Illogical statement, akin to saying. "The grass is green because it's green grass". The correct explanation is that the grass reflects light waves at  560–520 nm at a frequency of 540–580 THz" One statement is logical, one is not.  
---
I'm sorry you are disappointed, I tried to help you the best I could.
---
You clearly don't have much experience with super fleets, so maybe stop pretending to know how they work.
---
must be exciting to get like 300m worth of kills with a cap fleet! GJ snuffed!
---
Hel
---
So what if they drop more? You have a superior super fleet, kill it, no one can stop you. Continue to kill as many as the enemy throws at you for as long as you choose to, knowing that you can at a whim rotate any assets you want into/out of said system since you have killed the jammer. Once you have a foothold in the system, don't release control, fight to maintain it-- just like you fight to maintain anything else in this game.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
/r/totallynotrobots
---
You don't have a superior super fleet, because time zones change, and people have to go to sleep. Are you seriously suggesting to me that camping a system 24/7 with no flaws for the entirety of the reinforcement cycle is a perfectly reasonable game mechanic? People need to sleep and eat at some point.
---
They do, just in hisec where all the systems are named.
---
I meant a public one.
---
You are welcome to explain to me where I have a logical hole in what I'm saying and I'll be the first to amend it. No need to be insulting, it's just a game.
---
You log off and listen to trap music.
---
I don't know where you are getting your numbers from but they're pretty far off unless you mean with roommates. According to reports the avg rent in Vancouver is $2100 for a one bedroom apartment so no roommates anyways. And where is live in a fairly small town of &lt;100,000 people the best you could find is maybe $800 for a run down one bedroom apartment 
---

---
Again, why are you forming for the timer. Yes your window is super small (no pun intended) if you wait to move in right before the timer. Preposition, plan and attack, hold the grid from the unjammed adjacent system and the jammed system.
---
We did the same thing: neut comes in, everybody’s riding the warp train to the POS.
---
Then you stay there until he/they leave. In 15 seconds, in 5 minutes, in 5 hours... 
---
Every tick you’re not mining, as a bot, you’re losing money. If you have to wait a half hour before they leave, that’s a costly affair. It has to be fairly easy to set up a watch system that interrupts the mining process frequently. I wouldn’t know how to make that work in the long run.
---
Mining is extremely profitable in a well-run fleet. If you can keep at it for hours, you’re making tons of ISK. But if you have to wait for the neut in the system to leave, and he could just be zooming through the system in a cloaked boat...
---
I was in a war once. We’re talking 10 years ago. I had combat skills for shit. I couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn. One of the guys chases me to the station. He’s hanging at the undock waiting for me to make a dash for it. After a few hours I come back. He’s still there. I convo him: “Have you been here the whole fucking time?” He goes: “Yep.” with something like pride in his voice. I tell him: “I’m amazed and admire your tenacity. The thing is though, I actually went to bed and left the client running. I just had breakfast, I’m leaving for work.” I never saw him again.
---
/true story
---
If botters head for safety with a neut in the system, you can make it extremely costly for them and it takes precisely 0 effort.The returns on that have to be diminishing with frightful haste. Unless I was a Chinese slave in some kind of jail situation where I had to farm for the local warden, I have a hard time understanding how you’d do that in 0.0 and make that worth the time and effort.
---
You have to form for the timer, because if you don’t, why are you hitting the jammer. The point of killing the jammer is to allow you to kill something in the jammed system. A sotiyo, for instance. So by your logic, you move in ahead of time in a surprise op, gate into system, kill the jammer, and then proceed to defend that system against all attempts to anchor a new jammer for the next 9 days or so, without slipping up at any point in that 216 hour period, because if you do, all your progress is wasted and also your super fleet is probably dead.
---
Again your argument is flawed, you are proposing going into a contested grid when the enemy knows exactly where you are attacking, what gate you're entering and  when you are attacking and is also  perfectly prepositioned.
---
There are Goons, however. The "Turing test" is also a thing...
---
I've lived in Calgary and other small towns/cities in Alberta throughout my life. None of the people I have known over the years have ever paid more then 650 for rent over the years with the majority of them paying between $400-500.
---
This isn't some BS I've made up to win an argument. This is my own experience.
---
As far as i know there is no official information. From what could be seen on the testserver before the invasion event got disabled it, the triglavians will be invading random systems and occupying them till they are liberated
---
Basically, everything I said is accurate, and everything you said doesn't work. 
---
That's the logic hole, and if you are ever actually in a super fleet with a good FC, it will be painfully obivious.
---
Nope never said nor implied that.
---
I don't see what the big deal is. Be buys tons of nice ships and helps them for other's benefit. If anything the community should be singing his praises.
---
You implied exactly that. How else do you plan to take down a structure under a cyno jammer, following your method of ‘bro just flashform and kill it early.’
---
When afk farming it's the assumed outcome. You just hope the farming session lasts longer than the loss of the ship! Haha
---
Painting a Hel with real blood? Still a more humanitarian game than Warhammer.

I was replying to your comment that 800-1k rent in Vancouver is probably the most expensive. If a one bedroom in Vancouver avg's $2100/month then that 800-1k is very very cheap. Even if you went with a 2 bedroom and a roommate the avg is around $3300 for a 2 bedroom so thats more than $1500 a month each. I know Toronto and Vancouver are much more expensive than most of Canada but $400-$500 seems unrealistic based on my experience. Even $60 is pretty cheap really. But I'm sure there are places in that price range !
---
This sub can be incredibly toxic at times.
---
Perhaps people are envious of this individual having a good time, even if he is losing supers?
---
Let's not call him stupid, etc for playing a game and enjoying it.
---
he really is lmao
---
stop subbing the ones you don't want to plex for, do explo since that has variable loot prices, also bounties haven't changed either to my knowledge so wh is irrelevant.
