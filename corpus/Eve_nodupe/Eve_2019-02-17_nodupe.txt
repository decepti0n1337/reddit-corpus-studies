yes, bots would not have their own single covert ship class in system with them, never, nope, that wouldn't happen
---

---
without being able to differentiate between bots and players you have to give the same resources to bots that you're giving to players. this would make bots more safe from random people who don't have one of those ships with them while making it no more dangerous under and circumstances (for bots).
---
ironically this would make life as a non botting player harder, which would likely push more people to adapt a botting playstyle
---
---
---
There are better ways to stop bots. Making you solve captchas would not help at all, but would annoy regular players a lot. I would never play a game that required you to regularly enter a captcha.

Had a friend with an alt corp wardec BSC when he saw rox was back online, started blapping their AUTZ members while the corp was still in hisec, started having a convo with them and got them into our nullsec corp, that main guy he shot has secured us a couple kills as tackle, bloody champ

Gotta get that rmt monopoly back, eh?

Every time they comment lately, they blatantly lie.  Since the interwebs are magic and people call them on their lies, now they just don't comment at all.  CCPearl Abyss best shitcompany 2019!

Your posts show that you have an extremely low capacity for thinking outside the box at all.  Frankly, you don't seem to be able to deduce things that are practically right in front of you.  
---
This is a testbed, what's in the boxes right now don't matter, it is a way to measure consumer reaction and the underlying system of distributing the lootboxes.

One of the Punishers here. You guy were absolutely amazing. Wittcomb in particular had my back the whole time, quickly getting re-lock on me even when I was forced off and had to come back.

From what I've seen, that seems to be a common point in all of his posts.

Lazier players too. So many would rather right click jump/bridge to rather than roam and find a fight.

I guess it goes with the times of current gaming, instant action, no effort required for gratification. Sad really.

Interesting and informative post
---
CCP is using the same method they use on everything else; try to take something another company has been doing for years, and make it worse.  Its basically why their other projects have been utter failures, and they show no sign of stopping.
---
I actualy liked the rig idea, but i think it should come with a price, (btw, i was nor around during the casino era, so i dont know how it was before)
---
B-b-but its gonna be different!  PA just bought CCP to throw money away and let them do their thing!
---
/this forum a few months ago
---
Yes and then the Bots Just solved those too
---
Had\*, they removed it because it barely did anything to slow down the bots, and it was a big inconvenience to regular players.
---
CYKA BLYAT﻿
---
With this event im not in the mood to thank them so count me out please.
---
This is a terrible solution and it's naive to think that this will do anything to stop bots. This will end inconveniencing regular players and do nothing against botting, sure owners of bot farms now need human intervention, but there's more money to be made from bot farms than lost by hiring some guy to solve captchas. 
---
This is exactly what the black desert community told us happens with PA. 
---
We were also told PA acquisition wouldn't change the game at all, but now we have lootbox tester events and no AT so the lie detector test determined that was a lie.

I have been banned from his channel nearly 5 years and he always likes to take a pop shot at me on stream along the lines of "\*REEE this guy, like, boiz, omg, boiz, like he messaged me like 100 times and I had to ban him.\*"
---
I sent him 2 messages - one was the obligatory "BBTB IS THE BEST POSTER" via eve-mail so when he opened it his screen was filled with bright pink scripture of truth.
---
The second message was when he was flying some garbage ass fit like normal and I sent a message "\*Bro stop shit fitting your fits\*" or something, then contracted him a deadspace fit sleipner which was \~super leet\~ at the time. He never saw the 1B isk contract, raged at me, banned me from chat, and now rages about me every time he has an opportunity. 
---
The only reason I'm commenting is b/c I know he'll get baited into reading this thread and then rage more and cry about how irrelevant I am.

What happened to EveOvermind? It used to be a great tool for comparing ships in 1v1 matchups. I saw that it’s not kept up to date when I tried to look up Vedmak details. Is there an alternative?

---
Wittcomb is known around DnG as one of the two obligate logi pilots - he flies logi almost exclusively, usually dual boxing (as he was in that fleet).
---
So you're saying that legacy diplomatic deals only apply when its convenient? I for one am shocked.
---
Skill injectors is a good principle badly executed
---
Also at this stage nerfing rorquals only hurts everyone else in the galaxy
---
This completely encompasses how I feel about the AT and Eve right now. I was on teams in 16-17 and a practice team in 18. I was never a great AT pilot but I did my part for my team. We made top 8 in 16. My corp is 95% dead in game, but we're all still bros and I attribute it to the camaraderie we build in the AT. Also the AT is pretty much all that's kept me subbed. I still log in occasionally for roams, but this 'hiatus' feels more like a death knell for this game that I want to love than anything else CCP has done in my seven years in this stupid game. 
---
Thank you for this video. 
---
I will take any pvp video over random trash thrrads by bored grandpas that skip work and slack on reddit. Thanks for sharing.
---
I said that in XiX local and a GM said I was reported for it
---
Good times
---
This is a fantastic idea therefor CCP would never even think about something like this, plus good luck getting Nullsec to stop krabbing for a minute and have fun pvping without a forced CTA.
---
Biggest problem with botters is that many of them don't even run a full blown client, it's just a simulation of the client.  Eve could fix a lot of issues by moving around data locations in the code.  It would take tweaking the compiler every time they compile an update (plus a few other things that are a little over my head) but doable.
---
He plexed (apparently $500) to get mercs to war dec a corp that was in his hisec island that didn't want any part of him anymore, I think the war was 49 losses his side against 2 (t1 destroyers) lost other side... 
---
Lawyer here. The definition of gambling is that it's a game of chance where player skill does not affect the outcome. This isn't gambling because some amount of skill is necessary to get the rewards. 
---
Wew lad...
---
Cheeeeeerzah!
---
I mean two large groups known for rmt?, must be driving the prices down so now it's time to go to war.
---
In every group project there is 1-2 people who do everything and the rest just coast on by. Guess who does what. 
---
Seeing Red alliance join with XiX hurts.
---
What null is missing is regions where they form up kindof on par with the roaming gangs they have in their space, not with titans and supers.
---
That is not even the half of it.  Some botting programs do not even use a full blown client and can run dozens of characters on a single computer.  A bot does not need pretty space textures, a bot does not need a UI.  A bot needs an overview list, a d-scan list and a Sig list.  A botting program can just read that info from the computer's memory and run a program/script.  The fancy UI and graphics are something the client does to format the data in a way a human can read it.  A computer program needs no such niceties.
---
Yeah well fuck you too
---
I think the trouble with this idea is that anything complex enough to defeat bots is probably going to defeat half the player base too.  Also not sure I want my super teleported off someplace and back at some indeterminate moment... that could get very awkward.

injecting into avatar does not make you good at flying that avatar or make it better than all the other avatars in the game, injectors regularly result in hilarious loss mails for this exact reason. Pay to win is not the same thing as pay to advance.

Looking for an exploration ship that can both hack relic and data sites while also doing the combat anomalies I find. Have 3 ships I’m considering right now, Stratios gnosis and Nestor. Which one can be easily fitted to do this?

Better yet CCP needs to make mining modules have a mini game in which you solve a CAPTCHA, they can be a third crowdsourced CAPTCHA solver where instead of 0.50$ per 1k it’s like a bunch of scordite

I did that once, petitioned it and got all my stuff back that did not drop.  I thought it was impossible to aggress someone in hughsec when your safety is green.  A short time later someone reminded me (yes reminded, I did know this some time prior but had forgotten) that you could indeed enter an LE with someone who is suspect even if your safety is green.  I still feel bad about it now (but not enough to SD my replacement confessor).

The answer is yes. You probably dont even need the Exile booster that most people run. Def run the Crash booster and pyro though.

&gt;This is a really great response with some super good feedback, thanks - I’ll make the team aware of it :slight_smile:
---
&gt;In general terms, we’re still trying different things with events, and this of course is going to lead to some unpredictability.

---
&gt; Absolutely, while they don’t always respond, the team who are working on events keep a solid eye on these feedback threads.
---
&gt;In fact, after discussing with them a few releases back, it was actually their idea to separate out event feedback into its own thread so that they can better look at what needs to be improved.
---
&gt;Coupled with this thread, there’s also a sentiment review that gets delivered by the community team to the events team, and we regularly discuss where the issues lie.

Good attempt and thought out but a bot will then just be programmed to complete that task. I have never had a bot on Eve, though it would seem trivial, I have had a bot on Wow. Some of the bots that are made would blow your mind. In the dreanor expansion we we're raiding and I had my bot on a second account as a druid healer. The bot would pull better numbers than our other healers sometimes and was even set up to reply to whispers and chat if directed at it. I played with the bot for about 3 months before getting bored and not a single person in the guild had ever once questioned it being an actual person.
---
I say this not bragging or some stupid shit but to inform you of how well bots can be made. Eve mechanics are super simple in comparison so designing something that is just a pop-up interaction wouldnt be very hard to counter. But with a revamp to the pve model I think there would be hope. Select few would still be able to but, if pve were designed with fleets in mind and not soloable isk faucets..maybe.  Design the fights and models to be scaling or ever changing so that it would shake up having one cookie cutter build to fit all. Similar the the burner missions but more focused on team play / larger ships. Changing damage holes and effects. 
---
Tldr; revamp pve. Just shooting from the hip on ideas.
---
People are just crying like when they were noobs. Toxicity leaving the game is good in my opinion. Have been having a blast in the game and the less toxic old vets around to spread their bullshit to new players the better.

NO YOU FRIGGING IDIOT.  THE FACT THAT YOU PAY A FEE IN ISK TO GET A LOOT BOX IN ADDITION TO THE MINERALS AND TICKETS IT CONSUMES MAKES IT GAMBLING.  HOW HARD HEADED ARE YOU TO NOT REALIZE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SPEND REAL MONEY ON PLEX TO THEN SELL FOR ISK???!!!  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE...... Even if NO ONE who buys their ISK will real money buys a LOOT BOX it is still a form of gambling.  Every isk that gets consumed in an isk sink (and that is what this event really is, an BIG, FAT, FRIGGIN ISK SINK) is an isk that cannot be traded for anything else in the market.  A credit/gold/isk sink in a game causes DEFLATION.   The values of everything goes down as a result, EVEN PLEX.  This deflation costs then costs EVERY player that spends money on the game more money as a direct result of their real money being able to buy less!!! (/reeeeeeeeeeeee)

Damn, guess I'm not coming back. Will never see resolution to the storyline :(

Slot machines routinely pay back 90%+ here in Nevada.  I don't think there are any games that pay back as low as 25% E(x).  That might be illegal.
---
Why do non-NPC stations seem to always offer free repairs? What's the catch? Is there any danger in using them? OK to park goods &amp; ships in the hanger, or is there a risk?

Correct me if I'm wrong: some techniques such as counting cards in Blackjack are skills. Outlawed by the casinos themselves but not the law. They enable the players to reduce or eliminate the luck variable.
---
So (this is where I think I might be wrong) if the law does not consider them bad, isn't its very concept of gambling incorrect? Because for example, I think Blackjack is considered gambling but there are many cases of players getting away with using these techniques, and many others where they tried, got caught and banned by the casinos but nothing else because it's not illegal.

Those are Upwell structure, informally known as citadels. They are a recent addition to EVE that take the place of traditional NPC stations. They will repair you for free while tethered, and you can repair for free when docked. There's no catch, CCP just decided that free automatic repairs were better than manual paid repairs. 
---
Upwell structures are player owned, so it is possible for your docking rights to be revoked by the owner. That wouldn't prevent you from undocking, but you'd need to use asset safety to retrieve anything you left behind. If you're in highsec you're not exposing yourself to any additional risk by using them.

Wave after wave of changes have pushed balance heavier and heavier in favor of caps/supercaps. Roaming has been made harder and harder, especially now given the ability of (super)caps to apply so well. Playstyles are vanishing. Yet you sit here and tell us to adapt. Adapt to a HAW/Boson titan. Tell me how that goes for you. 
---
Yes, I love the game. Thats the reason I don't like where its headed. Plenty of people have communicated whats wrong with how the game has changed. Some do it with elaborate math, some with graphs, some just by putting up meme clips showing how broken things are. I really don't know what could be said or shown that hasn't. The criticism has been made not only in a usable form, but in every goddamn usable form.

In most space anchoring time is just over 24 hours. There are special rules when you anchor a citadel in a sov null system that is not owned by your alliance. For each level of the Strategic Index of the system, one full day will be added to the anchoring time of the Citadel. —[source](https://english.eve-guides.fr/index.php?article=132#Deployment)

Going to provide another point of view here, participated in Zarvox' fleet and had a lots of fun. Even with you "camping" us. Zarvox decided to take a break in A-REKV, a dead-end system branching off a pipe deep down in the south. Straight after break he admitted that it was a mistake, continued to do so several times.
---
Listening to him the whole time I can't say that he was salty to you in any way. Memeing and provoking, yes, for sure. But you guys did the same in local, that's ok and how the game works. But everybody can take a look at the VOD later and get an own opinion. 
---
Additionally, the fleet we fly isn't made for fighting other fleets. I can recall him saying this often every fleet and every FC can decide what he wants to do, logging of and denial of content is a valid strategy. You can't seriously expect that we fight jackdaws, a hard counter to our comp. Then continue to smugpost on reddit that "Zarvox didn't took a fight".
---
So if you talk about salt here, look in the mirror first before throwing weird accusations. Alliance members of yours came into the ingame channel and fired salty insults.

Imagine if your job as a designer included making a certain number of skins and designs that you knew whose creation (from the company's position) was solely motivated around just making additional content that is just meaninglessly rained upon people via a slot machine placed in the corner of the game's code to justify charging people to use that slot machine instead of just playing the fucking game they already paid for.

Protip. Don't do industry production. If anything just mine moongoo and sell reactions. Industry makes really little money unless you devote near infinite time to it. Just go rat/sell plex/rorq mine if you want isk.
---
Sorry about the necro, but I think in terms of physics you can think of the weight of loaded ammo and its effect on the ability of a turret to rotate and track a target. Heavier (and generally more damaging and shorter-range) ammunition will weigh down the turrets, slowing their rate of rotation and therefore decreasing their ability to track a target, whereas lighter (generally less damaging but longer-range) ammunition won't weigh down turrets (though using that to justify \*improved\* tracking speeds is a bit of a stretch I think).

Diplomatic Immunity disbanded and most of the members went to Empyreus, who is restarting out in wormholes.
---
because offense and defense work the same way, calling a new ship a hunting ship doesn't reduce its ability to work defensively
---
if local is delayed for clients who's user is in regular ships then everyone who makes any substantial amount of isk will have one of this new ship, which doesn't have delayed local, sitting in system communicating the status of local in that system to all friendlies in that system

similar to how bots currently can detect if local is broken by sending a array of local entities and checking it against an array from others in the same system, if there are substantial discrepancies local is likely broken, is no longer an effective tool and it's time to dock up or move systems to one that is not broken
---
players will never be able to effectively reduce botting, there needs to be a systemic approach from ccp

Ah, I'm not on the TEST server, cause I'm already in 30+ other servers.

The AT when it had 10k viewers had a few important distinctions: betting through eve-bet (aka, viewer interaction), and a good amount of CCP resources.  I believe those two parts are key to a successful tournament.

Thats about as long as 12 monkeys each sitting at a keyboard need to randomly produce the code necessary. One likely wrote 1/4 of LOTR in the same time.

Those scripts would be dead if you do it right. Obviously it'd be Eve style mini game not an exact captcha like you see on websites and ran through an encrypted exec on encrypted connection.

Of course with time even these will be solved and bypassed, but that will take a while and it is an ever going back and forth. There is no one final solution.

Agree to disagree, cause I'd rather see bots stuck on traffic lights.

How many other games do you see people multibox or bot 30,50,60 or 100+ accounts at once ? How many of those that do have botting in them come anywhere close to Eve Online in overall bot, game mechanics and dev and business model support ? Show me a game that is equal to Eve in the scale of these.

How could loot boxes in this game be pay to win? 
---
Genuinely curious since I am on the fence about my feelings on injectors and plex. I see your point and it makes a lot of sense, especially when you mention the hilarious kill mails. That said, I don’t see how eve could be pay to win.
---
Because that someone is smart and/or doesn't care about the negative threads about himself or even spontaneous grr goons threads, as they are harmless and can be easily mocked/twisted/neutralised. On the other side, misleading someone, provoking people who happen to be enemies of you or your spacetribe just because they chose a different flag, pushing them away from this subreddit or even from the game, now that's something that suits your nature, isn't it.
---

Whatever.

Totally clears the President!
---
why is there Frat hate in Goons? 
---
I was just about to post this and saw your post. I feel like the biggest problems with skill injectors would be at least pretty heavily mitigated by not being able to inject skillpoints into capital skills.
---
People need to understand that CCP is not 10 guys in an office, it's a big group of people separated in departments working on different stuff at the same time; and some times just putting more people to work on the same thing is for the worst.
---
Wtf are you even babbling about. Most popular and economy damaging  bots are used for making money on anomalies. They are heavily dependent on local. A local delayed covert ship can be used to hunt them. There is no automatized moneymaking application for such a ship.

Artists fixing servers again?
---
Were the artist going to program the structures in the game that would need to be anchored and have some sort of mechanic that people could see them with?
---
i misread what you were saying, i thought you meant delaying local for everyone but your new ship, you're saying a single ship being delayed to everyone else, much different and there would indeed be no way to use this for bots, it also probably wouldn't be very helpful in getting rid of bots either though not many bots operating without friendlies protecting them
---
Xbox. I'm trying to stay as far away from the Eve machine as possible.

Was one in last month or two and there is a good bit of PINOY players spread across most TZ's.

Also imagine being spodbrain enough to think dreads will apply to abing dessies that's big brain.

They majority of subcap bots rely solely on local to survive. Many capital bots operate outside umbrellas too, but yeah a good number live under umbrellas

Your lootbox didn't have the item you wanted? Compete none issue, just fucking buy it from the market.

People don't understand CCP and their parent company. They don't care about you and about having fun. It's the mobile/modern gaming play book and gambling/micro payments is their MO.

If you've been running a lot of gallente mission, your caldari standing my be low enough that they will shoot you when you enter their space. It's been a while for me but I think -2 or -2.5 standing is where navy rats shoot you in 1.0 and -5 is where they shoot you in 0.5...

It's like they learned absolutely nothing from EA and BF2
---
Can't wait for them to ruin it so I can unsub forever. They're 80% of the way there with recent changes.
---
I think you just described shattered wormholes.
---
One of the problems I have with wormholes is that I have no idea how to find content. Imagine this: you are roaming though null, but you can't gate anywhere. Instead you're thrown into a random system in null, so you can't for example visit a specific place saying, "I want to go to xyz's ratting pocket where I know there is content," then just gate there. Also, you have a ~5-15min timer before you can randomly visit the next system. Also, the density of people is way less. I know there is content in wormholes, but I have no idea how it works.
---
How about doing this for Stain and adding a gate from lowsec to make it easier for people to get there. 😁

Our chinese (PLA) hate their chinese. Its what always happens with country centric groups. Russians hate other russians, Chinese hate other chinese. I dunno if theres other groups that are based on nationality but if there were I expect them to fracture and loathe each other if they start getting big enough.

I wasn't particularly meaning dead as in, extinct.

More dead relative to what they were.

E.g. PL used to be the 'boogie man'. Now? Nobody is particularly worried about them turning up out of nowhere to push your shit in for the slightest lapse of attention.

The passage of time has been far kinder to horde than their allies, imo.

the blue one w/ the sandclock is "limited time" (you cant buy it, only get it during a limited window of time) you also get that on cerebral accelerators and other event items

QFC/SR had supers long time back, when i was there (Spring 2018). One guy had a Nyx parked in a POS on an alt character in A-5F4A They also had one Avatar, parked in the same fashion.

Then this: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74704781/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74704781/) in January. They can have supers, but they are not allowed to BUILD them or own structures that can park them. (KS)

PvP for PvPs sake sounds great...on paper.

I'm guessing this tag is like the limited tag for event items.

shit you can only get for a limited time - the blue limited tag being from events, the purple premium tag being from the nex store,
---
but hey, it says premium so lets throw another hissy fit over a non issue!
---
Lol why are you still in the "being shocked that eve is adopting mmo tropes" phase? That ship sailed 2 years ago
---
Why do you keep saying that
---
&gt;I think we have this tendency to be really supportive or hyped about stupid things or small things that really don't matter.

because we gave up being supported or hyped for 'big/important' things after consistent delivery failures.

If you're trying to live solo or something, or your corp is just full of ping warriors, then scanning for content can be a bit much. But chains flesh out really quickly when there's a few people working on it, and that's not unusual to see even in smaller WH groups.
---
Dude, you're a literal noname bottom of the barrel player in spaceship MMO where 99% of people can't play the game. Why do you even feel the need to write a worthless comment under random PvP video. You can mute it or just not watch it. Legit the weirdest criticism of an eve video I've seen.
---
stick something juicy in a site and the content will find you....
---
What if the longer a ship was in space, the longer it took for local to refresh. Stating docked for say 5 minutes would reset it.

Make it easier to catch bots and rorqs. Legit players should be using intel anyway.

To follow up on this, FRT (and in general, Winter Coalition) have this hateboner for any Chinese who isn't them. It's no different from the mentality of "you must be with us vs. the filthy laowai or you're a traitor" in PUBG.

They hate our Chinese corp in TEST because of it.

last post of his i saw on reddit was him saying he was having some tough times irl but was getting back on track.
---
He said he's focusing on getting his GED, so i imagine he is focused on that right now.
---
there are a bunch of other event items without the blue limited tag, too.
---
i agree. stupid, lazy, and unnecessary clutter.
---
well hopefully things go good for him IRL, but i feel like he could bring back the AT and fix the gala event if he was still playing.

Is kind of funny a company based in Iceland an EFTA member state is going against EU anti-lootboxing laws. But its ok, they are just a subsidiary of a foreign owned business now. CCP used to be one of my top ranked publishers, now the on my A-List of top ranked scalpers.

Literally only major things that have changed since I stepped away in 2015 is more and more monetization. CCP Games, is a complete shell of what it was....and I will still give them money here and there because I love EVE, I hate myself every time i hit that resub button.

From his store page:

Hosting is free, and instant, all you need is a twitch channel. So if I just start my stream, end it, host, repeat - do I get infinite points?

Theres an auto host feature also. So I literally would just have to click start stream, stop stream.

At that rate, I’ll just dock up my VNIs for this amount of isk

Be prepared to buy your lucky Shakutu box for 50 million silver for that .000001% chance to get purple boss items but most likely to get a simple tier 2 tech piece over 99 percent of the time.
---
14000 Raider Points for 100 PLEX on the site.
---
So like, $4.5 per 100 PLEX, and so $22.5 for 500 PLEX or 1.8 Billion ISK. If you're a subscriber though, then $11.25 for 500 PLEX or 1.8 Billion ISK.

I mean it was a 50/50 shot between goons or ~~their blues~~ test

You mean buying stuff on the market, warping to a gala site and clicking buttons a few times is “skill”? Then slot machines aren’t gambling either, because you first have to find one, then sit down, insert your coin, and pull the trigger ... only a skilled person can do that.

---
That actually sucks. I've been waiting for my school to end before coming back but this kind of thing makes me hesitate.
---
&gt; Boredom is the largest driving factor these days.
---
The boredom for these major alliance is self-induced due to their oppressive squashing of any content that is not 110% on their terms.
---
I lose my fucking mind whenever I hear Goons complain about boredom when they drop supers on t1 cruiser gangs.
---
If Caps are winbuttons why wouldn't people use them?
---
No I totally agree the boredom is self inflicted. However it's a bit more complicated than that. Nobody likes to lose so when a side is faced with losing they look at ways to win, be it through batphones or escalation etc.
---
The history of eve has lead to a position where both sides do extreme measures to ensure they won't lose. It also links to when a random fc from X coalition goes and third parties something out of boredom but it gets seen as a coalition backing someone so the other side does the same and it turns into a batphone game instead of a random local conflict.
---
I heard tbe same argument in Black Desert, pay to win exists when real life money = in game advantages
---
You didn't say stomped. You said losing. The two are not necessarily the same... Whole rectangle and square thing.
---
It's the right quote not from fun Russian translation of that trailer :)

Some say it's the correct one lol
---
You just perfectly described Americas War on Drugs.  
---
Spoiler alert, your method doesn't do anything to deter the sale and even serves to drive up the market value of the black market goods.
---
Because outside a few rare situations/circumstances losing tends to be synonymous with stomped.

&gt;Every bittervet is preaching for the noobs of the game the same mantras (regularly with cocky tone). One of the classics is the “\*adapt or die\*” line.
---
Not true at all nowdays, with the tutorial and new player posibilities EVE is fuckin' kinderarten, thats precisely what it is. I couldnt give two shits to be completely frank, as long as those new fuckers dont compare EVE with the shits they came from requesting core game modifications, better newbie protection, bumping nerfs and many other. So for me the usual "adapt or die" turned into "fuck off" completely.
---
Seems like your more upset he’s in delve then anything else..... did you win a free cap on his stream and you can’t pick it up ?

It can be argued that piloting a ship is all enough, but also fitting one as well.

The bar is pretty low, but not as low as sitting in front of a slot machine
---
Game is nearly dead in Japan so, what do you mean by "East?" Just China?
---
That's one of the few objective and distinguishing characteristics between luck and skill based games. 
---
in nullsec yeah, that's true. Come to wormholes, even the losses tend to be a lot less one sided :)
---
Is it really this bad now? I don't know - we have the Tutorials, The Agency and all that but it's still Eve. I think you are afraid of a gamer-type with a casual MMORPG attitude, risk aversion and a really low attention span and that is used to get everything presented in an easy and comforting way. You fear a situation where this type of player will flood the game and CCP will only listen to them. But even with all tutorials in the world - is there a realistic chance of this happening in Eve? They would have to change and simplify nearly every game mechanic. I think these players you are talking about are losing interest really fast (mentioned attention span) before they can do any harm.
---
Accessibility was always something that was keeping the player base lower than possible. I think this might be exactly what some peaople like(d) about Eve. But looking behind accessibility Eve will still spit out any casual player that is searching for an easy game without risks (only my opinion).

Where is Jared Dale - we ask ten random capsuleers:

"Jared? Sorry, don't know him."

"Jared Doyle? The one-armed exotic dancer at Jita 4/4? Heard he was sold to some goons, likely turning tricks in Delve."
---
"Jared is dead, man. I killed him myself. Looted his wreck and ate the corpse, with some chianti and fava beans."
---
"Jared Dale? What's that, a new ship skin?"
---
"Dont know, man. But hey, give me all your isk and I'll go find him for you."
---
"Sorry dude, he's gone south to find that lowsec Stain gate. You'll never find him now."
---
"Huh? Do I look like I'm your fucking phone directory? Get the fuck away from me!"
---
"Jared the hauler? Yeah I heard of him. Insmother, I reckon. Or Drone Lands. Or maybe Fade. Wherever there's people crying out for cheap freight and cheesy smiles, there's a Jared."
---
"Hur hur. You ask questions. You gay. Hur hur. And dumb. Hur."

Sure, this its against the rules, but his exchange rate sucks. 68000 for 30days of game time. Thats 23 dollars? Yeah, but this probably does boost his donations.

They did and eventually scrapped that since players hated it abd botters still found ways around it.
---
Jesus Christ, even after trying to fucking remove him from DIP for ages, I still have to hear about this idiot. This guy scammed the shit out of some people on his way out of RMC (to the tune of like 30 dread hulls or something), was scamming people building capitals inside the alliance (taking deposits for half the order, then taking over a month to finish something like a carrier hull despite stating a week or two on delivery). He's just a bottom dwelling cockroach. I reported him to CCP twice for botting. He would "claim" to be at work, but would be mining nearly consistently 23/7. The CEO, Genghiz, is literally subhuman trash. When RMC was doing tax collection on mining, he moved his characters into TNT (or LAWN, I can't remember) and was mining in RMC space to dodge the taxes for both coalitions.
---
We had a three-day argument about how "No alliance in the game would ever need to see my wallet journal, assets, or transactions in an API, so I'm not giving you my ESI tokens for SeAT" where he had some "director" of his come in and talk to me about how nobody ever needs to see anyone elses assets, at which point I found out they didn't even do background checks.
---
The dude is 100% setup for RMT. He's a massive moron, and it irks the fuck out of me that with the chatlogs from Discord, stream links, and everything else that they didn't investigate him enough to ban him.

I mean, you can't refute anything I said except by saying "Try harder". I legitimately regret that I didn't awox you when we were shutting down, and the only reason I didn't is that I respect Welsteil and I didn't want to cause him unnecessary grief. I've been playing this game almost 15 years, and to date, you are probably the most annoying person I've ever dealt with. Not **just** because you're wrong and clueless, but because you're so convinced that you're the smartest person in the room that I legitimately feel bad that people in this game follow you. It never ceases to amaze me how the shittiest people wind up with people following them.

Yes you can buy it on playerauctions

That doesn't really solve the core problem, which is gambling addictions. But now that I'm not on mobile and can see your flair, I understand now why I'm not making headway here.

I kicked you last year, right? fucking krab

Take your upvote and leave
---
Why cant we have real world ads in eve?

It’s still more effective to buy plex. I can post the marsh if you really want but it’s almost 18% more efficient if you just buy the plex 
---
So this is fake or true? I just bad understand now who is who...
---
Stratios can run 10/10 ded sites?
---
if it was an issue - the game outright would be outlawed as you're gambling every time you kill an npc because it has a random loot table.
---
besides - you can't get anything from the boxes that you can't buy directly. there's nothing to gamble for.
---
you aren't paying irl money, and there's nothing exclusive.
---
Doesn't matter. Obvious rmt is obvious. It's against the rules and it should be punished. WITH DEATH! (in-game ofc)

As of this very second in EVE Online i can,
---
1)buy PLEX
---
2)Sell plex for isk
---
3)Buy lootboxes off market
---
4) open them 
---
Which one of those steps requires any player skill whatsoever?
---
All the capchas out there are solved by machines. So if a CCP Dev finds a way to make one that machines can't beat he'll be swimming on money. And not CCP money. 
---
Is playerauctions safe for selling accounts?
---
That's what he said
---
Oh, forgot to cite the source: "This bullshit claim is generated by players, for players." :D
---
He probably does this, he used to do it in DIP, and in the alliance Discord too.
---
Why would falcon need to be pinged for this? He's just a PR guy. u/ccp_peligro Is the correct person to be pinged for this.
---
Please go beg online in Jita

Or just ask your Corp/friends to come help you out?  Or you know. Not engage his orca in the first place. He can't scram you if you don't start the limited engagement. 
---
What kind of ship is recommended for Level 3 Security missions?
---
Pay to win means you are buying an advantage that can not be earned in game.
---
with loot boxes now in the game they are one small step away from "premium" loot boxes that can be bought with plex that feature exclusive items you can;t get in game.
---
Does it matter now? Games dead.
---
the people offering those scripts would find away around them, and the sites that sell the services of real people to solve them wouldn't even notice. 
---
Yeah, the nullseck guy was kind of clueless, it showed he didn't really do his homework to understand a bit more who he was interviewing.
---
Doesn't seem like a moron to me. The whole thing is actually quite smart.
---
I get what you're saying now.  This is all in the context of loot box mechanic discussion.  Didn't mean to derail or sidetrack your thread. Sorry :p
---
Why would you bother using a HAW dread if you can just use cap guns. Marauders cannot move in bastion, get a huggin and a vigil+ dread and you should 4 shot the marauder.
---
yeah :(
---
Cruiser/Battlecruiser I believe.
---
In any alliance except DIP, he would have been run out of town long before that. However, the situation was that the exec was perma afk at his new job, borrowed some money from this dude, and the guy who was running things didn't want to boot him due to the afk exec's responsibility to him. In hindsight, be all agree (the remaining corps from DIP that joined PYRE) that he should have just been removed, and we went on with our lives. But, hindsight is 20/20. He's apparently still trying the same things, so we'll see how that works in a group that will have no issues removing him.
---
[EXACTLY!](https://i.imgur.com/nQKQnjR.png)

Not to defend that ping in particular, but Falcon is pretty good at getting the right information to the correct people.

Based on plex going for 500 at 20$ and those stores prices he's basically reselling plex at a higher rate than if people just went and bought the damn plex legally themselves... how dirt bag can you get?
---
Don't have to accept something just because it's expected.
---
P sure the confusing the official forums with this forum. Been doom and gloom here from the announcement far as I've seen.

It’s not that hard to setup your own currency to be bought with IRL money in order to exchange in a store for ingame items

I like the creative thinking. But in my opinion there is not a ‘right’ solution that players can come up with. CCP has billions of options to detect botters. They just don’t have the right tools build in behind the scenes. In programming basically everything is possible, and a simple example is that ccp could log all inputs in X amount of time, and check if the inputs after X amount of time are the exact same (indicating that a script is running because thats not humanly possible).
---
Well you see, if 6+ C2-NS/Cx groups all roll into TEST space at the same time, and they all run either 9 plated bhaalgorns with no tackle or the elusive shield/nano bhaalgorn with some light tackle, then you would be within some right to claim that fleets of 50 WHer bhaalgorns roamed your space.

Don't worry soon all us bitter vets will be gone and you guys have can have your trash game full of bots, RMT, instanced PvP and PvE to yourselves. The won't be any bitter vets to teach newbies the ropes or to lead roams. They won't be there trying to get you to participate in content that they have spent hours creating. All the bitter vets who spent countless hours creating tools like killboards and market apps will stop supporting their tools and you will be left with nothing to track your dank frags. But it's ok because you will still have abyssal sites and all those sick ship skins that you can look at while you spin in station since undocking takes too much effort and there is no one there to lead you or tell what target to shoot next. Have fun hunting bots because they are the only ships that actually undocking to do anything. 
---
Who was it
---
So...FW space?
---
&gt; Not even that. Using your example the core problem is that injectors and krab safety make it so EVERYONE has a tank now. When before you had to have a certain amount of time commitment to be able to even fly a super, now everyone can do it. 
---
Well, from my point of view it merely accelerated the natural progression towards caps. Remember PL dropping on everything and everyone that was a decent kill? Now, everyone can do that or rather: protect himself against that with a decent muscle. 
---
On the flipside, it needs more than just one alliance to muscle up against goons and soon, Test will join the critical mass where it outmuscles decent entities too. 
---
Yeah, I agree titans shouldn't be able to hit supercaps. Supercarriers? Well, I do think superscarriers are less unbalanced. Fighting a blop of supers is difficult sure, but it's not like you can't do anything about it. Kill fighters, Super can't harm you. Titans however have way to much power that you can't mitigate in one way or another. 
---
Not saying supers are perfectly balanced, but at least you can tank through them until you've killed the fighters. 
---
&gt;Well in order for me to avoid a fight I need to have scouts, I need to plan my escape going through enemy territory, when cornered I have to log off in hostile space (like I did last night) and plan a way to get out. There's so so much more effort and strategy in that. For the Isthar krab...align...warp....safe.
---
But at that point, it's not you vs the ishtar krab it's you vs all the pvp'ers between you and the PvE player. So, why do you bring the PvE ishtar to this particular argument in the first place. Because you want to kill it to provoke a fight even if you could have fights on the road to the PvP krab? 
---
I am sorry, but doesn't that strike you as a: "I really only want to kill that Ishtar-krab"? 
---
&gt;It's not about crying and we can pretty much move on from insulting one another. It's boring at this point and I think we've gone through all the names we can use.
---
Alright. :) 
---
&gt;It's this shift from a more combative nature of Eve into something more tame. And that's what bothers me. It's becoming a sim city simulator.
---
Uhm, I can somewhat agree to that impression, for PvE - Mining can be a lot safer than it was years before when we had no umbrellas and sig-based mining etc. We also have that "safe" abyssal space. So yeah, PvE got easier.
---
On the flipside though, we have bigger wars with bigger assets being thrown at each other. I for one do like Big fleet fights. I came back to the game from a hiatus because of it. I am unable to see that as the ultimate bad thing that can happen to the game. 
---
More PvE leads to being able to afford bigger guns and I can't help myself - I was a HS Carebear before and moved to null because the notion of being able to build and yield big toys was very appealing to me. Now I have a decent stock of assets, very little isk but some big toys and I very much like that. 
---
I understand it's not what you like, granted, but these big toys have been a part of the game for a decade as well and proliferating more of them (less exclusivity) has certainly made this big war end game possible. 
---
I don't think eve is more tame because of it though. Yes PvE is, but PvP got a lot harsher because pilots will put more on the table. A loss of a nyx is a much harder hit for the initial pilot than the loss of a VNI is.
---
The fact that we don't have constant wars and people are still affraid to lose their big toys (remember that "dock your faction titans") is a testament that it's still harsh and big losses still mean something - just that the ammount of loss one consideres "harsh" has grown. 
---
&gt;If we had limited local I would also push for a revamp of pve that encourages "small gang ratting" with essentially pvp fits instead. PvE has always kind of been "meh" in this game." Catering to it further will weaken the game. We need a reformat on multiple levels.
---
Glad that you agree to the idea of compensating for local after all. I would make this a condition to change local though. No local change without changes to PvE at the same time. 
---
&gt;TIL You need a 50k coalition to kill citadels...THEN you can 5 man roam to kill people.
---
Nah, not really. You don't need 50k people - you just need a ton of isk. Keeping the timer paused with dreads then welping dreads till the keepstar is dead is a viable option, if you can afford it. What was it? 300 dreads to do this or so. So yeah, can be done, still expensive. Which was my point when we argued about whether it's possible or not. 
---
As I said, the argument can't be a "you can't by design" because you do have the option to destroy everything. Whether or not you are capable of doing that is a different argument really. I understand that you as part of a small entity can't yield the tools needed (not enough people, not enough ISK) but saying it's "impossible for you to do so" is a really different thing. 
---
&gt;Glad we're catering the game to renters.
---
Nah, we certainly don't, it's just an example for the fact that there are people out there that can't rely on an alliance. Renters are an extreme example, yes. However, there are alliances out there that simply don't have a capital umbrella and a widespread network of jumpgates etc. and I don't agree that they are irrelevant for the discussion. 
---
&gt;Sorry for "elite arguing." In any case you're still misrepresenting what I say.
---
We are both representing the others argument in different ways - that's okey I would say. 
---
&gt;Shoot rats. You can still shoot rats in pvp fits. See you have "all the tools" you just gotta do it.
---
Yeah, ever tried that in actual sites? Yes, you can still shoot rats, but if you do it, you might as well stop doing it cause it won't lead you anywhere. Unless you are in a super ofc. 
---
&gt;Most people in 0.0 live in alliances. And 0.0 should be dangerous.
---
Absolutely agree here. Just that living in an alliances doesn't mean you have a 200 man supercap fleet at your disposal that will aid you when you need them. A capital umbrella isn't a default thing for joining an alliance. It only is for the big alliances. Again, the argument here was that there are people out there that have to rely on local because they have nothing else and I think that's a fair argument. 
---
&gt;Problem is krabbing is just too safe. It really is. Unless someone actually pushes to threaten your space, you either grind your losses way faster than you lose, or you have easy safe areas because of all the aforementioned reasons.
---
Ah well, I don't feel it's that easy. I've krabbed my way up from nothing to about a 100bil in assets and about 7mil isk liquid right now. Okey, I am building a titan and I probably wouldn't have done that if Delve wouldn't be as safe as it is. However, if someone comes along and kills my rorquals I am broke for at least half a year. 
---
All it takes for that too happen is some bad luck while I am mining in space. So, I very much feel that the risk is there. It's just that: There aren't all too many entities that try to gank me and that's where I wish your small gangs would man up and bring something decent to threaten me. 
---
The fact is though: these small gangs can't afford it. Yes, they also don't have the numbers but I would consider that self inflicted and thus, it's not an argument. 50+ people can be a sufficient wrecking ball and it's really not a number that's hard to get to. So, what remains is: the isk it would cost and that's where I agree: people outside of null don't earn the isk they would need. 
---
&gt;Better solution. Create group pve sites that require people to work together. Fair?
---
And then someone brings 2 or 3 times the numbers to gank them. Still the same argument =&gt; numbers advantage can't be countered which is exactly your argument when you say you need 50k people. 
---
I mean, I would like group based PvE in Null a lot, but it's not a counter to my argument nor does it eleviate your problems of having the N+ advantage stacked against you. 
---
&gt;It's not that tackling a rorqual is hard. But you drop a bubble on the rorq, it lights a cyno, titans come through. End of fleet. The things you say that are "so easy to remove" are only removable if you have a massive alliance or they aren't defended.
---
Yes, ofc - the numbers advantage isn't easy to overcome and you would have to grow as an entity yourself to be able too. It's something you could do though. The wealth advantage however, is uncounterable for you as a small entity because the larger entities are too far ahead and have to many people for you to catch up on that. 
---
That's just another reason why it's a wealth problem more than anything else. 
---
&gt;This has ALWAYS been a major appeal for Eve Online.
---
I agree, loss has always been part of the appeal of EvE. Permanent loss you need to make up for. If I lose a nyx today I've lost 30 bil isk and it will still take me 60-80 hours of gameplay to replace it. It's not like loss doesn't matter anymore - it means less for some than it means for others and it generally means less for people that are more wealthy. 
---
Goons have a policy and rule that it is forbiden to petition bots. Mithani talks alot about it in firtalks or whatever it's called and it's alot of bullshit if u ask me. He uses nice words and all but the truth is they want bots in their space to generate income for the empire.
---
Delve is the absolute safest area to be a bot plus your fellow goons ain't allowed to petition u.... I petitoned loads of ppl when I was there.
---
What The Mithani tells goons is against CCP values regarding bots, so tbf he should get banned for lying to 15000 members or so.
---
It is our responsibility to report bots or those we think are boting to CCP. Then they do their investigation to deem the person boting or not. 
---
We as players are not the judge jury and executor CCP is. 
---
Report every fking player u think is a bot even if u are with goons. 
---
confirmed ra test pets

some of fc in ra joined test
---
It's weird how every time ccp makes a controverial decision only those in the csm that parove of it come to speak publically. The others(we can presume they don;t agree with it) just stay silent.
---
No wonder CCP keeps the CSM on board while cost cutting in some other places. They get a wonderfull pr team for their company.
---
They won't, ccp wants money
---
You mean the place that has citadels and caps... 
---
They are also not required to use this platform. I get your point but there is zero obligation other than a feeling of service, to post here.
---
What is a trad wife? 
---
You have completely misunderstood the concept. When the new hunting ship enteres local, Noone can see it in local for the next x amount of time. Bots couldnt counter this with their own hunting ship,  since it would see local like a normal ship.
---
Tho, I appreciate your input and passion against bots, they’re pretty fucking scummy, this isn’t about botting lol
---
This amuses me
---
&gt; He would do some super scummy shit and then when called out on it, be like "You guys are just being mean to me because I'm from country xxx" and then pretend there was this huge cultural barrier in place that made it OK for him to scam but still be the good guy but there was no way we could understand it.
---

Barely any caps in fw space. All the PVP is happening in sites
---
Don’t listen to this guy. Don’t become just another goon with a few rorq alts. Be different. There are tons of ways to make ISK, industry can be profitable. You just need to know the market
---
If everyone else was being a cretinous gobshite, would you?
---
The only premium ammo I would accept would be fashion ammo. With glitters, hearts or shit like that
---
pretty sure that's because it was autz on a weekday, but you can keep making up whatever you want to explain it
---
&gt; But the payout is negligible
---
You're not kidding.  I ran the numbers when it first came out and the LP was worth 'negative isk', the stuff you buy in the LP stores actually costs a fair bit more than just buying it on the player market.  Also, I don't think there was anything in the RW LP store that wasn't already available elsewhere.

Idk, all I see is a faint blur after “ignoring”.

Not entirely how it went, XIX did everything themselves, it had nothing to do with it not being feasible for us to stay within bridging range from the UALX Keepstar and having to counter hostile entosis attempts daily badly outnumbered /s
---
Eve 2019 :(
---
Probably no one would live there. It would be safe roaming spaces for subcap fleets without things exalting stupidly to caps and supers.

Or you just make big isk waiting

no some people actually use 10+ clients and arn't using bots.

He could bot a quadrillion isk and not be banned but if he sells a dollars worth he'll get banned. All part of CpP'S shitty immoral slippery slide game play ethics.

You're still a fag nyth

The goal 
---
Thank you for kind words and true AT spirit, mate.
---
Good luck and godspeed o7
---
Right, but if no one lives, then why would anyone roam there? You roam to places where people live, and fight the people that live there. You don't just take gates hoping you'll run into a random different gang that you can fight. 
---
Do you ever rat? Mine? Go 20j plus through null? All simple, all boring af. Add probes = subtract caps. You're sick of caps, move to jspace. Too much work for you? There's always hisec
---
its not original... its the somber blink formula
---
haha... 
---
I predict this will end one of two ways

Remember to wash your hands before you rub your eye's son.

Nobody wants to fly out to the middle of nkwhere hisec for 20m which is literally worth less than nothing. Its actually prob worth more like 5 anyway

What drugs do you do?
---
Do you get actual worthwhile loot from the wrecks in these sites? I stopped doing these events when CCP started trending towards putting event rewards at the end of a progress bar rather than in the site itself. Grinding your points and then collecting your box of rewards in a station in complete safety is completely un-eve and it's one of the reasons I gave in the 'why are you unsbscribing' box.
---
I'd say it's more likely that most of those "biter nerds" want CCP to make meaningful changes to gameplay elements in the current iteration of the game that don't mesh well with the way they enjoy playing the game. Also add in some stability and reliability of core systems that underpin the ability to compete on an even playing field. For example, sometime in the last couple of years it became a crapshoot for me when taking a gate on how horrifically long the tunnel would be, sometimes I only get to load grid after I have automatically de-cloaked regardless of if there are any people in the systems I'm jumping between or if TiDi is active.
---
&gt;I did a month of PvP on the CCP and got fewer viewers than wormhole exploration

Burn them all

Legacy was already starting to move against frt before this so...

RIP FRT

Mate even CCP has trouble keeping up with people rolling unrelated alts.
---
Let's not try to make this a bigger thing than it is because of in game allegiances; when someone acts upon being passed information, that is the extent of action the player base can take.
---
Shit something else I need to waste my isk on now!
---
Both sides should just let their bots fight and see who wins.
---
Why then wait for being podded, why not sp loss when your ship blows up, and the bigger the ship the bigger the sp loss?!
---
They are win buttons if your side can field more caps, if you field caps and your opponent is able to substantially beat your capital numbers, the best outcome you get most likely is, that you are able to leave the grid and not die in a fire

imagine writing all this for a post that is rejected by the sub. Go back to the asteroid belt and keep those notepad thoughts to yourself

To make people even more risk averse than they are currently with cheap ships and no SP loss? It was an interesting system for sure, but doesn‘t foster people to get out and have fun.

One change i would like to see is the ore and combat anomalies be better/More available i.e. have havens and sanctums and large ore anomalies. Might get more people out in space. Not sure if this will change things people will still probably migrate to null as null seems to be safer for this. We also need an update to fw but yeh thats most likely not going to happen any time soon. Fw missions are ridiculous and i feel the tier system needs change as said before it dose not reward loyalty to your faction.

On second thought, let’s not go to Great Wildlands. Tis a silly place.
---
Please tell me where you are undocking 1.5bil marauders for casual home defense so I can spend more time there.
---
I checked this out last night, and found it dubious too, but have a few observations to add:
---
1. He has explicitly said several times that he is not a Goon, but is part of TNT. I am too new and not really involved in null politicking, so have no clue who TNT are, and whilst I know who Goons are (and how all the kool kids hate them, apparently), I have not the interest to have an opinion on either. There's a chance he's lying, obviously, but worth that claim being noted so any alliance leaderships concerned can check into his proclaimed associations.
---
2. The "better chance to win giveaways by donating $" is a fallacy. There is a max number of tickets that can be bought by RP for each giveaway, and with him giving RP merely for being an active viewer every 10 mins,you can earn enough to buy the max entries every round simply by having the stream run whilst you're afk or playing on another screen: no cash transactions required.
---
3. Given the RP raffles, and RP given for free stuff (like staying viewing the stream), it is possible to look at the store purchases as similar to normal streamer giveaways, except you get to choose your prize, or if you win multiples exchange two small prizes for one big prize. Ignoring the paid-for stuff for a moment, it feels like a loophole in the RMT rules, rather than a breach, but no more so than any streamer's giveaways (given they get ad revenue etc. from Twitch for increasing viewers and subscribers and such by running these raffles). If that was all it was, it'd be just as fine as any other streamer.
---
4. The only questionable part is the bits/donations earning points aspect. Effectively, you could join the stream, pay Twitch whatever amount bits costs (sorry, never bought them, don't know the pricing), use those bits to get a lot of points, and buy a capital ship outright. Technically, the wording of the RMT policy is that you cannot pay real world currency for items/isk, but in this case you pay real world currency for a virtual currency, spend that to get another virtual currency, then spend that for items; meanwhile, Twitch pays the streamer in real world currency at a reduced rate (they take a cut of the income before allocating the streamer revenue). It certainly feels like it's against the spirit of the rules, but given the indirect nature, it's fuzzy on whether it's a loophole or actionable since it doesn't break the explicit wording.
---
I think point #4 could do with some official clarification, so that either players don't unintentionally get involved with something that looks ok based on a technicality but will get them in trouble (and possibly the streamer us also unaware for the same reason and would change his set-up to remove bits/donations as means of RP gain if told officially), or if it is ok to do so this guy isn't getting blasted unfairly.
---
Do you really need to be good at flying an Avatar, when you're operating in a group that guides you into the correct fittings as a requirement. And there are literally hundreds of you?
---
Skill injectors buy skills, but not experience, sure. But when you factor in the amount of semi-competent individuals who now have access to the Titan alts, large groups pushing super-capitals as their endgame. And the N+1 being the go-to. You can see how it's affecting the game.
---
It self destructed
---
First off, LS is less forgiving than NS. Its really the only space in the game where you can "legally" PVP....but you lose sec status doing so, slowly cutting yourself off from being able to do anything related to HS, or the Empire Factions in the process.   
---
So I would probably get rid of the sec status hit in LS. It makes living there a chore because unless you have logistical support, getting shit from HS becomes relatively impossible once you go blinky.  
---
Secondly I would get rid of gate and station guns. Small Gang can't engage small gangs on gates/stations because the guns can swing a fight. So you end up with a couple fleets waiting for someone to take the first shot.  
---
Lastly I would flip the Asteroid Ceding from NS to LS. Problem with LS is outside of travel, there is no reason to go there. Put ABC Ores in LS and take them out of NS. Tie them to Moon chunks in NS as they are in HS. If you want ABC ore, you have to mine in LS.  
---
Make null dangerous again.
---
&gt; w/o fixing the old stuff first, there are tonns of skins in the game and like 5 / the premium and a dozen w/ the "limited" tag on em ... its a half assed hackjob
---
It's almost like the game is dead and CCP is just milking the corpse for what it can before closing the doors.
---
And this is why all the giveaways on my stream have equal probability for subscribers/followers/non followers.  It's RMT if any of the paying groups gets an advantage in a giveaway.
---
Maybe because I wasn't serious when I said you are good.
---
Passive income possibilities
---
Not even close to true, lol.
---
Give reasons to be out in space.
---
Buff scannable DEDs in a meaningful way so that you can actually live out of lowsec.
---
Allow rarer ores to spawn in limited quantities around lowsec without athanors. Make it as such that a null blob cannot effectively farm them but a small group can fund themselves.
---
Add more small scale objectives with a shorter timer than 1 week citadels.
---
Tengu should have been a hunter and Proteus should have been a warrior though. Specifically, a wotlk fury warrior, useless but so damn satisfying...
---
Probably be more successful if organised a SE Asia gathering in a hub like Singapore. Not sure there is enough numbers to support a Philippines only event but chuck in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore and you might get a critical mass.
---
Increase Decayed (Relic), and Regional (Data) drop rates by \~16%
---
I was referring to the guardians gala event. Buying loot boxes can be considered gambling. Belgium already declared it so. 
---
A shambling corpse is still a corpse.
---
The majority of the problem is in the mentality of the player base, not the mechanics. Sure the citadel dropping and cap dropping is cancer, it stems from the "I want to win" mentality. People want to win so they get in large groups, (eg SC, snuff, X null blocks lowsec pet) build up a capital umbrella, and are basically null sec lite. Honestly, you can't really do much to fix it either because the citadel spam is there and the caps already exist. Unless you came up with some sort of penalty for grouping up (how?) you are left with the current situation. Even if they did find a way to penalize people in that way, they would just move to null. I understand that people play the game differently but the whole player base is like this, even wormholes are moving in this direction with big blobby groups. 
---
I have personally known Markee Dragon for over 20 years. We were original commentators and contributors to UO Stratics back in the first years of Ultima Online. Markus is a genuine businessman and sincerely loves the games that he plays. On his twitch stream he never does what the OP is claiming about the person in question. Nothing on his stream is given in-game items. Markus went through all the process of getting rights to third-party sell for CCP. I like the guy and he is a friend of mine.
---
I've been trying to find good fights / whelp some ships in lowsec in subcaps without luck &gt;:( 
---
Hmm, it's almost as if industry is meant to be a fully fledged in game career path that takes skills, time and isk. Almost like ratting! Who would have thought?
---
OP, sadly I can't really guide you but never, ever take someone seriously when they tell you to give up what you're trying to do. Unless they point out a flaw in your plan. Production can make you plenty money if you have some starting capital and a business head, otherwise nobody would do it and the markets would just be seeded by NPCs. Research your options, look stuff up, and you'll do great.
---
No, poker is considered gambling because luck of the draw plays a huge role. I'm not saying this is a perfect definition but this is what most courts use to differentiate between luck based and skill based games.
---

not anymore, lol

Remove pirate ships BPCs in nullsec, make all of them drop like Mordu's Legion ships in lowsec.
---
I still prefer to buy my gametime with MittaniBux
---
i blame all the chucklefucks who  cheer at everything during eve vegas or whatever events
---
They killed my VNI!
---
I'm of the mindset that an area of space is busy or empty based on its balance of risk, reward, effort/inconvenience, and novelty (for lack of a better term). And that higher population in an area of space generally means more PVP opportunities.
---
Considering this, LS has low-ish risks imo (no bubbles, pods are generally safe, there's limited NPC actions against aggressors, there's stations to retreat to if being evicted from citadels... but you tend to not have a nullsec-style intel channel or the ability to somewhat control entrance to your home like WHs have). LS has potentially high rewards like from FW missions or level 5s or select moon mining, similar in payouts to higher-end PVE in null and WHs. But those things require more effort from a line-member sort to take advantage of than the stuff in null, and they lack the novelty of activities in WH space.
---
Imo this generally leads to LS being lower population, and therefore lacking many chances for PVP. Some extra mechanics exacerbate this, like citadels mucking up FW, capitals potentially being a "problem" kinda like they are in null, and a long-running neglect in general of LS that many Eve players know of.
---
I'd guess that for lowsec to be genuinely good space to live in, CCP would have to hugely revamp the entire game. Like... cut New Eden's overall size down by half or two-thirds while also rebalancing the risk:reward in all areas of space so that the whole risk:reward:inconvenience:novelty thing I talked about above gives each area of space enough appeal to a variety of players to be populated enough that there are actually targets to chase and therefore PVPers running into each other (besides killing those poor krabs).
---
Best idea I've heard yet. 
---
Who is Mithani? What is a firtalks?
---
Very definitely real friend blink twice
---
That doesn't answer my question, though 
---
Are synth boosters worth building? Do enough people use them since the agency drugs/leagal boosters in highsec changes?
---
From sandbox game to lootbox game. 
---
I stopped reading when you put the responsibility of coming up with solutions onto the players in the first paragraph.
---
Fuck off with that shit. It is the job of CCP to fix the botting problem, not us. We are not a game development company. They are.
---
28 minutes of an extremely monotone voice 🙅‍♂️
---
That doesn't work. Anytime a defending party has to step down their response in order to have a fun fight, you're counting players to make it work. This has to be something natural.
---
Great video.
---
But also sad to hear.. If this "Invasion World Tour" doesn't have some groundbreaking reveals, I don't know where EVE will go from here besides into the bin of MMO's that are just filled with those who are too invested/have played too long to stop.
---
Reminds me of Archeage, game was incredible on release. Thunderstruck log box happened, and it went downhill from there slowly but surely.. Now the only players left are whales who jump from fresh start to fresh start servers.. The servers that aren't "fresh start" are nearly barren, and the microtransactions are even worse than BDO.

This should be low-sec, tbh
---
pick a constellation in lowsec.  For one week out of a month special site spawn that include a special material that is just for jump drives, lets call it "spice".  sites can be gated to classes of ships.  Spice can be mined, NPC's that are collecting the spice can be attacked, etc.  make it like incursions but for pvp and only for lowsec.  They have the code to run incursions, just need to add the material and some minor tweaks.  
---
Where they score on the autism spectrum?
---
Lowsec not being worth it presently isn't so much about lowsec being bad, and is more about nullsec being so good.  The only thing to actually improve lowsec to make it worth living in would be a buff to the belts, and the removal of the NPC miners.  Clone soldiers and mordu spawns actually provide solid income, even for small gang and solo pilots.
---
Remove the panic button from rorquals, and further limit hisec moon mining to give people more of a reason to try out lowsec.
---
Lowsec is fantastic for solo pilots or small corporations. It is not fantastic for large corporations or alliances due to the lack of top-down income generation that nullsec provides. Lowsec does not have the respawn and upgrade capabilities of anomalies, thus it doesn't make sense to anom grind there, depriving corporations (and by extension, alliances) of ratting income taxes. One can argue that active moon mining is a thing and can be tracked (and taxed) via the ledger, but then we go to the risk versus reward factor - lowsec has a lot more traffic than nullsec and is generally more compact than nullsec, but the moons arent as good as nullsec. Therefore, most industry focused pilots choose to go to nullsec.
---
So to answer your question, lowsec needs to either have more top-down income generation to sustain large corporations or alliances *OR* it can be a breeding ground for small corporations looking to have small, regional conflict. 
---
The game died the instant SP became liquid.
---
Go to a station and dock in it. Right click on the ship and select get repair quote.
---
Or go to a citadel (player built stations) and sit there teathered to it. It will repair you for free
---
the scannable DEDs are pretty decent income tbh. Agree about the citadels tho
---
I can't imagine this doing anything other than crashing the prices.
---
Penalty for grouping up? That's easy. Reduce the amount of resources available in any given area. Less ratting, less mining, etc.
---
Flair checks out.
---
Think he was asking about a logi type fit for another alpha doing lvl 1 pve.
---
Make Ice exclusive to lowsec
---
This is it imo. Areas of space have PVP opportunities when there is a healthy population of both PVE folk and PVP folk. PVEers follow the risk:reward:effort:novelty balance of the area. PVPers follow PVEers and each other unless something intervenes (like artificially-low risk that local-&gt;intel networks-&gt;overwhelming defense fleets create in some regions in null).
---
Currently, highsec has a lot going for it in terms of low risk (NPC protections, wardec changes) and convenience (proximity to markets, where new players have inertia to remain because they begin there), with some novelty (busy space).
---
Nullsec has a lot going for it in terms of low risk (though this varies depending on what sort of group/region you're in) and enormous rewards, still having some novelty (politics, big fights), and only moderate inconvenience for most players.
---
WH space has a lot going for it in terms of rewards and novelty, moderate risks (yeah you can get evicted, but no local is a double-edged sword and hole control can work some small miracles), and moderate inconvenience.
---
Lowsec has potential for high rewards, but without an established group these things are risky and high-effort. Lowsec lacks novelty compared to other regions of space, except for FW, but everyone "knows" lowsec is dead and citadels killed FW and CCP doesn't care. Etc.
---
So go figure, highsec and null are busy, WH space is ok, and lowsec is low pop. And that's where PVP is. Highsec is full of war decs and ganks. Null is full of big wars and small roams. WH space has PVP (though it seems lower than you'd expect, imo because of how many jspace systems there are compared to the population). Lowsec is quiet.
---
Christ at that rate you should just buy plex straight from CCP.
---
We get rekt by you guys sometimes too. :-)
---
We honestly always have so much fun coming to your space. You guys always like to play around on grid and keep the content going. I think we’ve had 2-3 hours of constant content at times with you guys. 
---
We love when we get a connection near your space. 
---
Thanks for watching!
---
&gt; Remove the panic button from rorquals, and further limit hisec moon mining to give people more of a reason to try out lowsec. 
---
It'd take more than changes/removal of panic and reduction in highsec moon mining to make lowsec at-all appealing to the people of HS or NS.
---
I love how entitled you feel. Its a fucking joke. Content creators happen not because they vets but because someone said i am going to do something fun who is coming with me? Content will happen today and after you fuck off. So jump off that high horse and take a long fucking look at yourself in the mirror. You not special. No one gives a fuck about your entitlement. Eve will go on and i will have fun without you bitching in my ear.

he usually doesnt engage you in an orca. till later.  he starts in a worm or other small sig ship.
---
I'm sure there's a whole load of changes, but I am opposed to switching everything all at once.  I think a lot of what is wrong with EVE's meta is the result of sweeping changes rather than incremental improvements.  Panic removal is just where the start of fixing a lot of issues seems to be.
---
Heres how he'll get around RMT.
---
I love reading these but it makes me sad I wasn’t involved lol
---
That'd actually be pretty interesting, it'd be like a programming contest.

Prefer that tbh than over-reacting or fake enthusiasm. 
---
No sorry, I wasn't ever in your corp.
---
Though I had the misfortune to be on same comms with you in Provi in the past.
---
So why hasn't the OP reported him to twitch? 
---
removing cynos from low would ruin it imo
---
lucky bastard
---
Gate guns and sec status hits protect new players going into low sec.  Without gate guns, more gates would be perma-camped by instalock setups.  Without sec status hits, more pirates would be able to freely smartbomb camp systems.  Given lowsec's proximity to hisec, giving new players a margin of safety is important.  Turning it into nullsec lite without bubbles isn't going to do anything but aggravate people.
---
Higher skill injector prices would certainly address the power creep issues some players have but its not good for the new players.
---
CCP has a choice get more new players and retain them or milk more from existing customers and shrink the base. Sadly one is easier than the other. 
---
We are just going to have to wait and see what happens but i have a terrible feeling that another monocle-gate moment will come  sooner rather than later. This time though it will be Pearl abyss problem to address not CCP. 
---
More pve content / income avenues for people to fight over. Fix FW (haha)
---
Do it, you won't be missed.
---
The "highsec risk" bit comes from the lack of any AOE in my opinion. Bombers could be a great leveler and counterplay to larger gangs.
---
Bubbles dicourage mega shiny pods and the lack of them allows more bling than nul in ship fittings.
---
Though i may be retarded AOE seems to be a "great leveler" to me. Bombs for example would hurt large groups but do little to smaller ones. Who would want to bomb a 4 man gang afterall?
---
Thats only one aspect though. If lowsec and nulsec shared the same isk making opportunities as nulsec but with the added risk of less control over the space it would make a good niche for newer and older players alike
---
I just fixed the post. I was in my blockade runner, not deep space transport. Not even close to DST tank.
---
I disagree. Low sec has gate guns and stupid sec status stuff which deters PvP

Similar thing happened to me in a drag bubble in nullsec with a viator. I literally mwd'd out of the bubble while decloaked and he didn't even lock me before warp+cloak.

I did watch the entire thing. My comment came off as a bit aggressive so I edited it. It's still very much an op-ed though.

This guy locked my BR instantly. He had such low DPS coupled with him killing my unarmed scout 1st that I was able to gate out of the system tanking my BR with like sub 2k shield HP. I couldn't believe his DPS was so low. He was using 200mm autocannons, not sure how many though.

Thank you. This helped me a ton. I still believe the Agent missions are tuned a little too high but I see now that is indeed possible with high skills and faction mods.

---
&gt; Higher skill injector prices would certainly address the power creep issues some players have but its not good for the new players.
---
Just increase the taper so if you have more than 20m skill points you're only getting 200k per injector. For extreme therapy they could just work at all on high skill pilots.
---
Something ridiculously game changing, like I dunno say a timer that prevents caps from activating modules after jumps so they can travel easy but have to use gates to fight. Honestly both the players and game are so hugely invested in Caps Online I'm not sure lowsec even makes sense anymore. Take away the gimmicky (and kinda awful) FW plexes and there's very little unique about it.
---
maybe just make it so cap skills cant get a bonus from Skill injectors.
---
Capital ship Skillbooks, JDC, etc

Slightly surprised you don't think we're there yet. Honestly from the moment Seagull stopped regularly communicating with the playerbase and any signs of real development disappeared it kinda felt like the EAness had won out and the game now simply existed to milk the true believers. Nothing I've seen in the 2-3 years since have given me any hope to contrary. Honestly  wonder if being too lazy to RMT everything is the only thing keeping me here.
---
Just seed dreads lul then just seed super caps lets keep going until everything is b-r ezpz

Did I just subscribe to autismfacts? Aww shit...
---
Idk bout you but snuffvs siege green an shadow cartel currently happening
---
Funny it does a real poor job of getting me to leave. Unless they want to stack fatigue it doesn't really effect me.
---
If I get a fight I tend to leave and go some where else I don't know most groups that don't. Most cap fleets that drop on me could form a decent fleet for a actual fight. I'd still be outnumbered or more then likely blobbed but why risk anything when you gotta save for the next rorqual lul.
---
You can say adapt or die and I agree I guess it's just boring for both parties. I don't know anyone who drops caps like that who enjoys the game. I've learned to just roam in nullified RLML t3s and just hit and run shit since I can stay in someones space and harass them all day with no issues.
---
We should only have consensual pvp on timers we get pinged for by daddy.

---
The brawls snuff and voltron (SG, SC, SF, DHSJ) are having around siseide right now have been making low sec interesting for time being. I think the moon changes made a big difference to low sec as passive income is hard to come by and isk income compared to nul/wh space is huge

Just saying you need to correctly categorize your developmentally challenged eve players whom you encounter.

Excuse my bluntness but - obviously!

I've always been amazed at how some Eve players can bitch and moan about RMT and yet CCP gets a pass for doing it.  
---
Heads up fellow Eve lovers - the business people are in control of Eve now.  They are greedy and intelligent.  
---
I appreciate you putting the time and effort into doing this axoev.  I doubt your good deed will go unpunished, but there are people who really appreciate your efforts.

I mean that is a very successful model for literally ever mmo now.

Jesus, that english is terrible. Dran must have been drinking.

He ain’t no expert either.

And he says as much.

But I will always take a layman's researched opinion with supporting evidence over an off the cuff "expert" quipping about a topic any day.

Does this has anything to do with skill injector prices climbing significantly recently? What caused the price to at least 500m over night anyway?
---
Okay but how. Or is this where the “delete local” thing comes from?
---
Thanks to asset safety, at worst you'll have to wait a week or two to get back your stuff. But be careful with storing a clone there, since that doesn't go to asset safety. If the owners decide to unanchor the citadel, you could lose your clone (and implants) without warning.

Nevermind deleting local. Make it so that you don't show in the local list until you break gate cloak. As it stands now you're in local 5-10 seconds before you load the gate grid.

I have lived in lowsec for over 2 years. I ran DED sites, besieged cov. Res. Facilities for isk. Ninjafarmed wormholes as well. I have found a great group for pvp (from frig roams to capital brawl).
---
Honestly... only those say that lowsec is dead who are not living there.
---
Issues? Yes. Unliveable? No.
---
This woulda been a better comment if the crowd didn't need to be asked for applause this year.
---
Remove pirate battleship BPC drops from DED's
---
Add pirate BS spawns in lowsec belts (like mordus)
---
Increase LP needed to purchase pirate BS BPC's from LP stores
---
Decrease LP needed to purchase Navy Battleships from LP stores
---
Buff/rebalance Navy battleships/cruisers so all factions have desirable faction ships that people want to join FW for, or farm with LP
---
Fix citadel mechanics interacting with FW where you can't dock in a citadel unless your faction owns it and the system is yours, which would remove docking in neutral citadels if you're part of a militia in a FW system.
---
This puts more people out in lowsec looking for pirate BPC's to keep up with demand (like mach's, nightmares, rattlesnakes etc). More people in space means more content. It increases the price of pirate battleships so there is correct progression in the battleship line-up, instead of pirate battleships being cheaper than navy. Navy ship rebalance creates incentive to join FW and stay with your faction instead of flip/flopping to whoever has the best LP payout, or in the case of gallente, almost always winning so VNI demand can be kept up with.
---
Fixing citadel mechanics will bring back actual loss/reward when you take over systems and it not feel pointless.
---
1) TNT is basically a harmless parasite that attached itself to the underside of FatBees massive dick many many years ago. 
---
I wonder will he leave game again when he notices that there is still no lowsec gate to Stain ... like last time. 
---
Yup, A lot of us did. Myself included. This was way before EBay put a halt to RMT on their site. I used to sell ingame gold and equipment, including houses/keep/castle on Ultima Online. When I quit UO I actually sold my entire account and all the material on EBay for over 2k US Dollars. People were selling Stuff on Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot, and even World of Warcraft. None of this was against the EULA of those games at the time.

Are there any things you can produce in high-sec, that require really large ivestments with decent profit margins? Basically I'd like to start jobs with a 40-60 bil investment, that take maybe 2 weeks or so to produce. If they just net 10% profit, that s perfectly fine. But I don't want to haul all the time or start jobs on 10 toons. Any bpcs that would allow that? Or BPOs?
---
I see Chutlanins hypnotoad record. But what I think is missing is the post on russian forums.

Here's the link to original text: [http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=119824&amp;p=4209065](http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=119824&amp;p=4209065)
---
It already made about 120 + rating which is quite a lot for [eve-ru.com](https://eve-ru.com)
---
And here is the approximate translation of the text. Please don't beat hard. I don't have a lot of practice in English writing.
---
In older days the Russian speaking community was feared and respected in New Eden. There were times of giant empires which included several regions each, the times of invincible fleets and successful war campaigns.
---
CCP used to frighten capsuleers with Russian fleet Dragon, which was so tough that it 'burns everything' instead of shooting at primrary. The brutal voice of fleetcom on the language of Pushkin declares that the solar system belongs to them casually.
---
There were no impossible missions for Russians that days. There was no need for triple compromises with the CEOs of other alliances. Russian influence in 0.0 space was beyond controversy. Success appeared to be infinite.
---
It is February 2019, the remnants of several great formations of the past - nowadays Russian alliances run their pathetic existence independently in different parts of EVE universe. Each solves their own tiny problems, make their own bold plans, which are not possible to come true. Each one makes jokes of other ones failures. Each one believes that his alliance is the best of those who are still alive. There is no trace of a former power. Russian EVE  dropped to the bottom. There was no chance to get up and stand tall, cos everybody was sinning in his own pit and had no chance to make a comeback alone.
---
Nowadays there is no even one independent and self-sufficient Russian alliance. Each one of us is a pawn in a global power-blocks game. By power-blocks, I mean The Imperium, NC/PL, GOTG. As they used to collect power and multiply resources we used to squabble. We gonna end it today.
---
After many years of strife, the representatives of large Russian speaking alliances finally sit at the negotiating table. We decided that it is time to unite and become something bigger than a small independent alliance.
---
Beginning from this day Dangerous Voltage, Legion of xXDEATHXx, Red Alliance, Siberian Squads will combine their efforts and create the first for a long period of time Russian speaking coalition. 
---
My friends, it is time to forget old disagreements and harm. It is time to show everybody what we are able to do together. It is time to fight for our interests. Our future is in our hands.
---
We call for pilots that have joined different power-blocks or created their own small alliances. Join our coalition! If it is an alliance, a corporation or a single pilot - it is now everyone can choose a place for himself.
---
Let's write a new chapter of Russian EVE together.
---
This is it, there is no way back, we gonna make the first step today.
---
And he was flying a BR not a DST
---
its much more often the 2nd last in my experience 
---
you're a Provi krab. that explains everything.
---
&gt; boring for both parties.
---
Well yeah, you're making them do something they do not find fun and then are surprised they don't want to make it fun for you either.
---
I can't open it...
---
&gt; I lose my fucking mind whenever I hear Goons complain about boredom when they drop supers on t1 cruiser gangs.
---
If you want to use supers and the only reasonable opportunity is on t1 cruiser roams in your space... how exactly js doing so contributing to the boredom?
---
Where are the cat ears for my domi!
---
A type of STD. 
---
I have to disappoint you again.
---
I've got less ratting ticks in total, that the number of your good posts on reddit. And no, I haven't mined either.
---
The problem of lowsec income is nullsec. When you buff lowsec income nullsec blobs will come and take it and you can't fight against them as a lowsec alliance if the nullsec blob realy wants it.
---
just another anonymous pussy without a killboard. got it
---
Penalty for grouping up is pretty easy to made but just think about the outcry of the blobs.
---
Why would they kick you for it? Also you are probably better off without them if they have this cancerous mindset 
---
Old news
---
Uses I win button T3 menace
---
Complains about I win button caps
---
The absolute state of wormholers
---
Change the paradigm of citadels. Asset safety to lowsec only, only a handful of actual citadels per system, and move everything else to the Flex Structure paradigm.
---
you say again Theran alliance in winter coalition?
---
&gt;This puts more people out in lowsec looking for 
---
Losec is filled with special PvE rewards; Mordus belt spawns, Revenant BPC rewards for incursions, FW, L5 missions, mid-level plexes that drop the best tank mods, etc etc etc.
---
THEY HAVE FAILED.
---
Ima Pirate. I dont even know what RMT means. Lol. 
---
Removing athanors from hisec won't make moon mining in losec worth it, because the people mining hi hisec won't move to losec to mine moons. *At best* they'll move to 0.0
---
CCP is not good at applying new ideas retroactively.
---
The older event items are not marked as limited time either.
---
Why does a new player need to have instant access to end game ships?
---
I only run 4, never said i ran that many also stfu :)
---
Were't premium SKINs excluded from a CCP giveaway where you could get any SKIN from the store except premium SKINs?
---
it should be renamed to premium shit, then all be good
---
Since I grew up in Ouachita Parish and support Caldari, does this mean faction warfare?
---
War is always good for business.
---
Actually, we kill them, the blacklist, then report to CCP. but good fake news.
---
&gt;Why does a new player need to have instant access to end game ships?
---
Im not talking about end game ships im talking about doctrine alliance ships. People forget how big a train all the T2 weapons seemed.
---
T3 is big I win button just you know a single tackle mod kills my fit
---
well what do you expect them to do with all the isk from krabing?
---
Denial checks out.

What's the first song in the video? Sounds a lot like Rob Swire vocals wise.
---
Not enjoying pvp in eve that's a big think.
---
imagine living in a space that requires pvp and trying to avoid it at all cost.
---
That's a big yikes from me
---
&gt;None of this was against the EULA of those games at the time.
---
This is critical. It's OK if it's not forbidden. 
---
I don't like the idea.  Goes too much against the "learning curve" spirit of EVE.  And I don't mean that the game has to be cancerous to learn, but rather that a lot of this should come from the community and the corp you fly with rather than the overarching entities in the game.
---
Isn’t that the eve dream though? Making money, reselling at higher price, basically living off of scams and gullible people
---
Yeahhh that's....not useful. You made it sound like this was a response to this concern in particular. It's not, at all.
---
That's a generic response to over 500 comments. It means nothing in that context. 
---
Yeah thats what I dont like about the idea but I do think that it could keep more people playing, making the game better for everyone
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_damage_types
---
Or block access by simulation clients
---
all relatively low volume. To keep up with demand for pirate battleships (like mach's or nightmares) for fleet usage, or rattlesnakes for bots/krabs/pvp there will need to be a lot more people out in lowsec than there is now. DED's require you to scan down the site or combat probe, which any DED runner with a brain will see on scan and cloak/warp-off.
---
Being in a belt, you're at the mercy of d-scan and a good hunter will find you pretty quick. 
---
FW is not low volume, but equally broke because of faction imbalance through LP and citadel mechanics. Which i caused by a combination of pirate options being so much cheaper or equally as expensive as some navy offerings. Like bhaalgorns are cheaper than any navy battleship and are on par with pirate cruisers. As well as navy battleships not being in high demand due to poor balance/traits. Which lowers demand for people to be in FW.
---
Necro much? We got a lot more pressing issues in this game right now than an apology from 5 years ago. We are all already well aware of how much management is out of touch and doesn't play the game.
---
Once upon a time the only combat drones worth a damn were hobos/hammers/ogres for pve and warriors/valks/zerkers for pvp. 5 years ago CCP re balanced the drones so that Kinetic and Em drones were actually worth using.      
---
As for the drones damage thing I generally use EM against them but feel free to test it yourself. Run the Explosive drones for an hour or so and check your income then do the same thing with EM drones and compare. 
---
ah I assume your chinese are from the dominating group on the chinese server likely, where Frat are the ones that were their enemy.
---
I played for over a decade.

I quit like a year ago with no plans to re-enter the game, likely ever.

I'm one of the more hated people in the game and can count the people asking me to come back with one hand.

Want some shock news? Pressing F1 is not the only way to play or pvp, many people have played this game for over a decade and undocked less than 5 times in total, some of them have crushed empires.
---
&gt; imagine living in a space that requires pvp and trying to avoid it at all cost.
---
Avoiding? You realise dropping caps on your face is not avoiding right? 
---
&gt; That's a big yikes from me
---
It's almost like people with different interest are all playing in this big thing called a sandbox, nobody has to use it the way someone else does.
---
how the fuck have you been upvoted?
---
Have you spent literally 0 time in null? have the people who upvoted you never played this game?
---
The **ENTIRE POINT** of this thread is that people simply won't engage unless they get to stomp someone, and if you are the person being stomped, there's nothing you can really do about it. how did you fail to understand this?
---
I dunno, I'm not really a capital pilot and was more thinking of the fact that against turret dreads you can at least try to outrun the tracking if they're just yolo dropping shit on you even if you're flying a battleship, but carriers can pretty much apply DPS across grid regardless of support (and against battleships they don't suffer much loss from application either).
---
Start listening to talking in stations!
---
Look into T2 structure rigs.
---
I put ABs on my citadel bashing battleships. Those standup cruise missiles don't apply nearly as well when you can keep moving.

cant we just have the ol drop accelerators and skins and maybe a few other goodies like its been before?

To that point though havent RA, sib squad(lotta former stainwagon if i member correctly) and xix all hate each other too and fought russia v russia wars a lot through eve history
---
As far as I'm aware the EU have not yet adopted lootbox bans, and if they did they would presumably still have to enforce them if they want to keep selling game time to countries in the EU regardless of if they are considered an Icelandic or a Korean company.
---
Not saying what they're doing is right but your argument is a bit strange.
---
Good stuff in EVE at the moment? Still free to login and do what you want.
---
Want to Pvp? Go for it.  Want to scrap that adventure and try market crap?  Also cool.  Want to live in lowsec? Also still a possibility.  Want to ship spin and shit post on reddit? Also valid.
---
Not a lot of other games actually boast that level of freedom due to focused endgames, developer defined storylines, limited social interactions, etc...  And despite CCP's recent constant attempts to the contrary, people still manage to play their way.
---
Sorry I have no idea what you are talking about. You mean listen to local chat?

Wew lad, that's a big lure.

I see that more possibilities are opening up as I am training my skills. As I will have more options to choose from and ability to run higher end content.

It’s cool that the stuff I am doing now will still be a possibility when I have more skill points.

who?

If you still have that character I’ll gladly take it from you ^^ I promise your hard work will not be forgotten. As a relatively new player it’s too hard for me to grind up the isk to inject :(

Ah, the old “you dont understand my culture, botting is ok for me” tactic.

They used that one a lot, always expecting to somehow work.

&gt;Avoiding? You realise dropping caps on your face is not avoiding right?

Just like those level 100s in wow that drop from their flying mounts on level 20s that's some real pvp there I tell you what *sip*

&gt;Want some shock news? Pressing F1 is not the only way to play or pvp, many people have played this game for over a decade and undocked less than 5 times in total, some of them have crushed empires.
---
It's almost like I commented on this when I jokingly said we should only pvp on pings for timers. I don't considering dropping carriers on roaming frigs pvp carrier application is completely broke and has ruined the meta for literally everything. It's like for example some class in wow could one shot literally every other class in the game besides one then people complain that people are upset they can only play one class if they even want to undock. Like what my dude do you enjoy undocking to fly stuff that even requires logi to survive them compared to the old meta where every fight turns into a equivalent of a structure bash( few kikis on a well fit carrier)
---
I'm sure your really enjoying the meta atm compared to what it was even a handful of years ago being force to fly a handful of ships that can barely survive a carrier because 12k/s drones perfect application that can web/point
---
I'm not sure if you can even call this game a sandbox anymore their is one gameplay style if you want to do anything stack rorquals and play the n+1 game. 
---
Oh that’s interesting. Thanks for sharing.
---
Reddit is for cat pictures, titties, and shit posts.  It should be obvious what populates /r/eve.  Don't take the crying posts so seriously.

I just looked up who Theran Alliance is, their killboard is 18% dangerous. Ouch.
---
Agree mostly.  I think Archeage could have been GOAT.  But it's downfall was Trion cranking the cash shop to 11 and labor pots.
---
You need to accept this: with losec as currently constituted, people aren't going to feed you their PvE ships. 
---
Are you seriously smugposting about 1.2b worth of dead ships? You remind me of Init posters like me.
---
Rorquals are the best suitcase because of their good jump range and their ability to get saved if you're an idiot and get tackled.
---
If true, :blessyou:
---
Enjoyed the video. Feel some of your points has some merits. I personally am not be wearing a big enough tinfoil hat to agree on all of your points. Mainly CTs, they have been obnoxious to say the least, but the overabundance of event cerebral accelerators was a bit too much prior to their introduction. 
---
That being said, I agree about the AIA, and its indirect/direct intentions to increase cash sales of skill extractors. There is no way, that wasn't a factor.
---
Also another point, the lack of any major discount or sale on the package deals or PLEX (unless i missed some flash sale) we have not had one of the regular 20%+ sales in recent memory. They had been fairly regular reoccurring sales that happened every 3-6 months for as long as I can remember, yet last one I recall was early 2018 / late 2017. Is a serious point to why the PLEX/MPTC price has been rising beyond normal rate as well.

Side note, "Not like a Christmas elf jizzed on it." caught me off guard, and got me a good laugh. well played.

Hi, delusional boi.

So you dread bombed 2 retards flying awful ships? I mean if they can’t be bothered to fit well then they deserved the hard lesson. We were on grid in no time and killed all the dreads. Those two died in under a minute each with no situational awareness
---
Just keep spinning. Just keep spinning. 
---
Can't agree with the recommended drones choices and rogue drone damage leans more towards omni damage.
---
you're all ignoring the fact the guy said his mother should go and die...........
---
You proved it by fucking up - aka the classic eve way. 
---
The community has been ranting about Eve's imminent death for 15 years. Ultimately, the strength of this game is that community and there's really nothing else like Eve on the market. Those of us are invested, not in just in Eve but in each other (kumbayaish, I know) and in the stories and nonsense and sheer dumbassery that this game facilitates. One server, one game is the absolute best meta and no game will give that to you with sandbox potential like Eve does.
---
The way to look at the complaints is to recognise that this is a game that people *care* about - even including many who no longer play. There's still loads to do in-game and plenty of people to fly with, blow up, scam, meme/countermeme, etc. If you like the game, don't get discouraged. The reality is never as sunny or as shady as it seems if all you do is read CCP quotables and subreddit pitchfork threads. The game is in a comfortable plateau for coming up on two decades of existence and who knows, maybe PA and CCP find new ways to reinvigorate the game. I know people fear monetisation, but the fact that CCP/PA want money means keeping Eve alive and making it thrive is in their best interests. 
---
not gonna lie I thought that was the intro for a sec

---
&gt; It's almost like I commented on this when I jokingly said we should only pvp on pings for timers...
---
That's not a bad idea, you'd probably get more bang for your buck if you fought people that wanted to fight you instead of just making you not have fun, go burn some timers. The rest is the same whine that's been heard every year about oppressive ship meta, meta+1 if you will. The people are still the same, they don't want you around, carrier or not they wont make it fun for you if they can help it.
---
&gt;I'm sure your really enjoying the meta atm compared to what it was even a handful of years ago being force to fly a handful of ships that can barely survive a carrier because 12k/s drones perfect application that can web/point
---
I'm not currently engaged in that gameplay but it doesn't matter, we've ran the gamut over the years, once fighters get the nerf they deserve it will just be the next thing that's oppressive and 'anti fun'.
---
&gt; I'm not sure if you can even call this game a sandbox anymore their is one gameplay style if you want to do anything stack rorquals and play the n+1 game.
---
And by anything you mean empire building right, building your dreams if you will, I wonder if CCP have thought about using that for advertising to people who like that kind of gameplay, maybe even add a cool tagline like 'build your dreams, wreck their dreams' or something. 
---
because ccp accepts cheaters look at the botting issue

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeee

You keep that little dream in your little head :)

He did input broadcast to multiple chat clients - unless you say this didn't happen - and he just typed the same random string to multiple clients in the same second just because he was bored

You should stop thinking like a nullbear. It doesnt take a PVE ship to kill a pirate BS spawn. Id hunt for mordus barghest spawns in pvp ships. Find a spawn, make isk and if i didnt find one, find people to pew. You dont need a 100mn VNI to hunt for things.

You should accept that lowsec is not nullsec and full of bears. Its a hunting ground for everyone.

Bud if you are dreaming about eve - you have one serious issue here.

Are we all the same person?

only the mangos actually get caught might seem like alot for you since your not a goon but its seriously a drop in the bucket. When you have moons that bring out 120 rorqs on one grid. There are ALOT
---
btr?
---
No, goons are poor and their morale is broken. Invade Delve immediately to get the good ganks and firesales before the big boys snap everything up.
---
Look at the fits on those supers. No tank. Max krab.
---
Delve is fine with wonderful garbage men such as yourself to take out the garbage. Thank you for your service.
---
"delete local" seems lazy, seems like a better idea would be to go after the easy resources.  
---
How about we have the Triglavians find and translate the New Halaima Code of Conduct and start applying it to null?  Give them a HIC, open an abyssal tear and bring down a dozen Leshaks with a full support compliment on top of those Rorqs.  Scram, web, neut, and murder.  You wouldn't be able to send out a mining fleet without adequate protection.
---
That capital umbrella would start to wear thin if there was no such thing as mining in peace.
---
Injector prices are tied to isk inflation, and extractor and injector and plex and mtc and accelerator supply and demand, and sub prices.
---
If there is more isk, they cost more. If plex and subs and mtc aren't on sale, injectors cost more. Etc.
---
We haven't had significant sales in a while, and isk is still faucetting up and up, and the Christmas event resulted in a demand spike for injectors.
---
So injectors cost a shitload.
---
wait what? we still got feroxes? i thought we only have slashers left.
---
Nice to see a post that doesn't basically read "screw CCP". Get some variety in the sub.
---
Unfortunately that is not possible.  The server looks at the data wrapped in the transmission and does not care how it was packed or who packed it.  Sure you could add some type of authentication checks but those are fairly easy for a hacker to see and circumvent.
---
They have had a 50% sale in recent months
---
So you want to say that he did not input broadcast to those chat channels? 
---
Exactly. 60 seconds to dscan and run intel before they know you're there. Anyone prepared and attentive can get off grid before you land. Not a problem. 
---
Badly for whom?
---
input broadcasting to chat channels does not imply other activity, and input broadcasting to chat channels isn't against the eula
---
Fucking 10/10
---
He wasn't monotone really. Felt more like he was trying to convey hopelessness and depression at a probable betrayal of it's customers by CCP for $$$.

I havent actually tried to inject a titan, but I assume that is possible.

Doing more damage than most of the 100 / 1000 man alliances cowering when they hear delve yet moaning about goons this goons that.   
---
We can do this with a 6 man team....   
---
While you're probably right the story I'm going with in my head is they're what it's PANIC-ing from
---
You cant argue with stupid people. I would just save your energy lol. 
---
My takeaway here is that CCP is either making these events miserable 1) intentionally or 2) accidentally.
---
If 1) then fuck them for being dicks.
---
If 2) then fuck then for being so incompetent.
---
Someone please explain how this is a false dichotomy.
---
If only CCP did too
---
the isk cost of those supers were probably mined back before your siege cycle ended
---
This looks like a challenge to me.
---
I don’t speak for others, but honestly I say “Screw CCP” because they have had a decent track record and I’m just now disappointed. Blizzard has been fucking the players over for years so at this point I’m not even disappointed with them, but rather with myself for playing WoW. 
---
&gt;I havent actually tried to inject a titan, but I assume it is possible.
---
Yes its possible
---
&gt;Do new players need this?
---
I think its irrelevant, no new players are doing this. People are vastly over exaggerating how easy it is to get a titan from scratch.
---
Its 40 Bil in injectors, 40 bill for the hull and 40 bil to fit it. Its easier to inject into a rorq to mine your Titan but you cant mine a Titan with 1 rorq you would need 3 at least. again i dont think there are many new players doing that.
---
"Oh look someone call me a cheater .... better call him stupid"     
---
You behave like a teenager. 
---
It's his narration style. I actually love it he's one of my favorite content creators. I always used to watch his show to learn about the events. It might be boring to some people but I feel like I'm able to absorb the information he's presenting a lot easier than if his voice has a ton of intonation. To each their own
---
Its still not safe to rat in delve. We don't care if it was mined back in 5 mins lol. You goons are so brainwashed its funny. 
---
I wouldnt reccomend anyone keep playing let alone start tbh the only reason i might resub is because of the people i fly with
---
Someone else can bridge your low-SP ass.
---
ratted 15b this week with you camping local, pretty safe tbh
---
I guess it would add more stuff for the fake client to have to do. But with out a way to monitor stuff like check circumventing the extra work not worth it
---
On plex? I know the Meteor/Galaxy/Star packs have seen sales of 30%+ off or greater, but plex at 50% off? What....
---
Maybe the real jihad was the friends we made along the way
---
I don't like the idea of fixed fittings for ships. Yes, it might make it easier to start, but i think new players won't get motivated to make their own fits/get creative. If they ask advise from anyone, they will be pointed to Eve Uni or other websites soon enough. Too many ways to fit a ship to fix a default one.
---
Their primary task is for line members to make dank ISK. Wicked Creek is nothing more than a buffer. 
---
Also local inhabitants provide all important task of stocking markets with doctrines.  
---
Pew-pew guys like Viper's Bastards left for Razor or got merged with Fraternity. They also had some good solo-pvp'ers like Walleater
---
i've lost more ships to npcs than roamers.
---
npcs are still the biggest threat here.
---
I hope goon hate and farming spins up tbh. We need a good war again.
---
tbh other goons probably are
---
Back on an Alpha Holiday and, honestly, kudos to CCP. It's better than it was three years ago. Try reading Reddit while listening to Paint It Black. You'll just end up laughing. Cheer up dino bro. It won't happen, and if it does we'll steal the source code and run our own servers. I for one want a look at that POS code.
---
What you start with doesn't really matter, you'll be able to fly all 4 very soon.
---
Also, they're not ugly like a ton of gallente ships are. Case in point; enyo.
---
* grabs popcorn *
---
Guys, go to a better Corp. You'll enjoy Eve a lot more.
---
MarkeeDragon does the same thing with timecodes. I guess it isn't an in-game item, but I don't have a problem with this really...
---
Still if CCP outlawed other eve gambling/lotteries/raffles CCP should tell this person to take it down.
---
Sounds like a slaughter waiting to happen.
---
Oh well if you're happy with the state of things as they are, that's great.
---
I know, but it is going to take time to get these skills up. I just got my only frigate ship destroyed and that’s why it hurts. 
---
But you’re right, it could be worse. I prefer the Minmatar ships to Gallente :’) I am not as sad anymore
---
&gt;We haven't seen a nullsec, lowsec or wormhole focused expansion since Parallax in 2015.
---
good.
---
there's more to eve than a few nullsec systems held by about 3 groups of players.
---
I get that, but when like 90% of the posts I see are basically just "screw CCP" it gets boring. I can take it when there's a constructive point, but even a lot of those tend to get a bit aggressive in tone.
---
Okay dude is a fuck face. Have you played videogames online before? That shit is commonplace. I wouldn't even blink if somebody said that to me. Pretty weak insult really, just makes him look like a loser
---
Pretty much every game where the players decide the price of the market. I've tried some of them actually, you don't know how many tickets I've opened in other economic/political games because of bots. I hate them with all my heart
---
This is because I never mine. After years i still see things I've never seen in the game.  Thanks!
---
I am pretty sure you single handed took down the imperium. GG. 
---
Well next month when the MER shows Delve behind Stain, All will know the power of your actions.
---
Oh no! A few krabs that can't get on comms, or join a standing fleet died!
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
Dam how did you know my goal for the year !!! 
---
so you're condoning the fact that you can tell someones mother to go and die "because its a video game"? 
---
How are we brainwashed? It's not "safe" anywhere in null. Still Delve is safer than any other null region and as a result we make more isk than anyone else. You can blow stuff up all you want and you'll barely lower the delve time unit. Be our cloaky camper keeping the shitty players in check, we all know they could use it
---
Who are you and how are you relevant to delve krabing? Just dont tell me you are the one camping delve for the past few months, because you are kinda just watching goons farm their mothers milk out if those rocks and anoms.
---
You know what i loved about EVE? it wasnt how pretty mining barges looked like when they entered invincibilty mode what i loved about eve was going out with a small group of dudes and wrecking havoc throughout a region which is now impossible. No amount of pretty lights will make me forget what they turned this game into honestly fuck CCP.
---
Makes you think...
---
Yeah pretty much, people are assholes. No one is supporting what the dude said but it’s not really worth discussing
---
&gt; We can do this with a 6 man team....
---
Cool story bro, get back to me when you're doing it with 1000 man alliances and doing damage that goons would even notice enough to think about.
---
Mining is clearly still GREEN.
---
They are special not ugly, but if you really dislike it: changing your main ship line right now (at frigate level) is way easier than later!
---
I'm considering the fact that since I was about 12 and started playing Xbox Live I've been told things like that and worse in videogames. I don't personally think it's okay to say that but it's a videogame like what are you going to do? Do you lose your shit every time somebody insults you on Facebook too? What about Reddit? Get a thick skin or get your own Christian Minecraft server IDGAF
---
It is absolutely mind boggeling to me that you are proud of two super kills when 1. you welped your entire dread fleet both times knowing you're buying overpriced hulls and fits on 1dq market then jumping them to FWST thus adding hours worth of effort and 2. you are literally hunting Delve where you can fly around the same system for an entire day and just warp dread squads to different mongoloids for ultimate memes. You could honestly probably rat in dreads in different havens and just cyno when a goon super interupts your dank ticks.
---
It really blows my mind when I see someone bragging about fragging a super after losing a fleet of dreads... IN DELVE. How terrible do you have to be to only come out 3B isk positive lmao??! 
---
I am fully interpreting this post as you are buttmad you lost those dreads. That is the only logical explanation for you going out of your way to post a super kill in Delve. Not even a titan... a super... that you didn't loot. The most expensive part of that kill dropped and was picked up... by his alt. So at this point it's safe to assume that shit fit Hel some how magically came out isk positive by baiting you into two consecutive retardedly planned dread ~~bombs~~ fizzles. Congratulations Mar5hy - you are now essentially Olmeca Gevlon "Totally doesn't input brodcast" Goblin Gold 2.0
---
Holy shit. This post earns saltiest bullshit award 2019
---
We celebrate the culling of the herd, pushing our krabs into fleet by reminding them that carebearing isn't safe. Thank you for providing this valuable service for the cause.
---
lets face it, if it wasn't a goon and thus part of your narrative target - you wouldn't give a flying fuck either.
---
Delve is always safe to crab. It's an entire region. Camping a few systems means people move to another spot. Yeah some crabs die but so what? If people didnt die in eve it would be boring. So let the crabs who dont get on coms or check Intel die. Gives others people to sell stuff to 
---
Yes please.

I am waiting for my current skills to finish training, then I’ll start changing :) Indeed special! Just like me :-)
---
Yeah but it’s what a dirty sinner like you deserves for not being born into the glorious amarr empire, who can turn down white and gold ships
---
Username checks out?
---
The Amarr ships are quite nice looking, I just got myself the Amarr frigate skill book :-( I don’t know why I picked it over Amarr! 
---
But yeah going back to what was said previously you can train yourself to fly a proper ship, not something taped together by slaves in some space dumpster
---
Bullshit. Then u go against Mithani. 
---
&gt; comment people should make about these fits is “they are meh but they work”
---
Sounds like deliberate misguidance.
---
You say this would be useful for people that don't know any better, but this would only teach them to fit ships badly.
---
The key here is to cook the frog just right, overcook it and CCP's only income might rapidly disappear very quickly (a part of me would actually love to see that happen!). 
---
When your camping results in the death of multiple alliances, the break up of coalitions, and the death of 4 keepstars in a 24 hour period I'll consider what you say as relevant. Till then you should take lesson on how to be an effective cloaky camper. 
---
100k I believe.

This is the only outlet for it though, they squash dissent faster than erodigan on the forums.

---
&gt;Higher skill injector prices would certainly address the power creep issues some players have but its not good for the new players.
---
&gt;I think its irrelevant, no new players are doing this.
---
Yeah, but the fact that you can inject end game ships seems to drive up the price. I'm going to assume its not primarily new players that are consuming injectors at 900m each.
---
The indication is that injectors do not exist for new players. If they did, we would see restrictions that would make them unattractive to older players.
---
Press F for Mar5hy's last whine post.
---
good video!
---
fucking goons 
---
The worst part is that Eve will not go on. All the signs are there that CCP is squeezing every last penny out and putting it on life support. I have watched this happen to enough MMOs to be able to say for a certainty that Eve will not be profitable in 5 years.
---
I'm not salty I got dread kills and content, I'm just literally perplexed to the next level on how you guys are proud of this and I would like an answer.
---
extract, biomass, inject
---
It’s almost like there’s a middle ground between scare cam levels of over reacting and having 0 tonal variation
---
because feeding a few dreads to kill a ratting ship is clearly causing irreparable damage to the very core structure of the imperium.
---
At least reddit mods ban cheaters. 
---
Seriously mar5hy, why are you so salty? Were you not lover enough as a child?  The game likes what you do. You kill bads and you stimulate industry by killing said bads. Bring content to new bros But this whole delusion of grandeur thing really is getting old man.
---
High court judge StainGuy
---
That only applies when there's actually people working on something though. So yeh maybe take some of those people working on side nonsense and maybe form that balance team they promised years ago... :p
---
This is exactly why we opted to only target low effort posts instead of 'bad' posts this week actually.  We don't want to remove a topic or influence it too much. But man, things got over the top with "grrrr CCP" and people just got lazy with their criticisms. It got to the point where r/eve - which used to be that shit posty / kinda trashy place that at least almost always had something worth reading on the front page and a good way to get up to date on eve at-a-glance - became more akin to a twitter feed. You could only really tell what people didn't like but not really why. If you posted something you *did* like, well, good luck.
---
marshy got banned because reading stickies is clearly hard...

TIL dropping 30 titans and a dozen fax machines, all of which were built by **skill injected** rorquals and piloted by **skill injected** cap alts, on the 5 man nanogang roaming through your space isn't P2W.
---
Don't forget the citadels and moon mining. Which defeintely was not 99% for nullsec .-.
---
Or the sov changes where CCP wanted to encourage small scale fights and skirmishes but Panfam and Goons just spit in their face by just throwing jackdaw fleets around (accurate description of the average FC in eve...)
---
Or moon mining where the only people who cried where people who were about to lose their passive income.
---
The average player shouldn't have a say in eve like you want it unless we want an even more "idiot friendly" game than we already have...
---
Side note: what is it with all the whining lately about this and that and this and that? 
---
Simply a player that have enough of competing with bots, cheaters or RMT'ers - aka cheaters.          
---
Then why are you still here?
---
Someone explain this pls
---
you know that using multiple reddit accounts to circumnavigate bans is against the reddit ToS?
---
What really gets old is the banning because they hate him.
---
I used to love how cold and ruthless null sec was! It is now safer than high sec. Miners are unassailable, ratters are mostly bots and nobody travels the pipes anymore unless they are insta-warp/nullified. Too much safety has made the game stale.
---
"Can't find anyone to fight."
---
I hear people say this all of the time. I've easily found fights within 3 different faction warfare militas the past week. I use t1 frigs, and I will fight all other t1 frigs and sometimes faction frigs if I feel I have a large positional advantage. Pirate frigs I always blueball, if you're trying to drop on some noob in a novice plex in a rifter with your garmur you deserve zero fights.
---
Maybe this is the problem that a lot of you face? Flying too fancy shit, or always flying in gangs. Maybe "I can't find anyone to fight" actually means "my elit pevp gang can't find some seal to blob and club the fuck out of, eve is dead :(".
---
Well that is weak
---
You're so fucking cringy
---
&gt; what is it with all the whining lately about this and that and this and that?
---
short sighted people whined and whined, then got what they asked for.
---
unfortunately because they are short sighted, it wasn't what they expected.
---
be careful what you wish for.
---
Actually one of the first good abyssal PVP videos. Really like everything about it.
---
I remember this one french noob spamming his videos here where he basically would think himself of some kind of solo-PVP god because he fragged random noobs with a vedmak (and only vedmak),i think his name was arya yatolily or something. The polar opposite of your video. nice! Keep em coming!
---
he's reddit banned for vote brigading and keeps making new accounts to post, then he gets banned for ban evading and the cycle continues
---
Sunk cost.
---
CCP has already made that descision last year: After the Ascension (F2P) expansion failed to retain players, they decided to milk existing players. Their first step was nerfing jump fatigue. 
---
I'm sure of it! Good luck, have fun and try not to get scammed
---
I really dislike the way events are going. 2 years ago I loved nearly all of them, now it's buggy\*, The Agency/ lootbox infested, items require crafting.... 
---
Instead of getting reward from the site, it's obscured by multiple layers of unnecessary hindrances.
---
\*old ones had bugged npc/ items too, but that was one day fix, new events got too many bugs to fix before the event ends
---
Whelp he shouldn't have such bad shitposting and stop ban dodging on the subreddit and he wouldnt keep getting banned again. I like the dude. Spices the game up some but hes really easy to hate since he brings it onto himself. 
---
This is pretty much my exact issue. So many posts which were like a line or two of "screw CCP, it was better in &lt;insert year here&gt;" without any suggestion of ways to improve short of "go back to 2010". Or one of the ten million "Why don't CCP sort out the botters?" as though its as easy as renaming a word document. 
---
Some people do - I saw someone giving a suggestion about more aggressively tapering skill injectors or restricting what skills they could be applied to. Might not be a perfect suggestion, but its a suggestion. No issue with those posts, its the ones where people just want to bitch (and in many case, do it way more aggressively that is even vaguely reasonable) that I hate.
---
You mean you know that you're acting irrationally but just keep in doing it anyway? Sounds sane.

Calling jibrish nazi, do your fucking job

I mean the simple answer is “yes” it’s crazy easy to rat in Delve.

In other news Goon fleet kills Hel (with no dreads) on other side of New Eden to Delve. Is any pubbie krab really safe from Boat’s willingness to double-pap bribe his fleet into going 70 jumps to kill one super?

Ah, yes, another "the CSM is bad" post. Try voting next time. Or, y'know, don't. I want to see if we can slam home three candidates in the first STV elimination round this year.
---
250 hours in and I’ve already been told to uninstall the game. Are you sure you want new players? :—) 
---
Its easy to say he is brigading.. while there is no proof for any of this.. unlike the massive goon bridading we can actually see here on reddit... and goons having way to many moderators in here not going against that including threats.
---
To be honest, the only ccp i know on reddit is falcon. I know he can get info to the proper places. Thanks for the correction ☺️
---
So its his fault for beeing unjustified banned and mods can just ban whatever and in order to prevent beeing banned you should accept beeing banned? What kind of logic is that?

Lol it's a skin big deal.

Doesn't effect gameplay.

Wtf are you Talking about?! The Typhoon is one of the sexiest Battleship hulls in game!

if you think minny ships are bad. you haven't tried the Hurricane.  or seen what a minny battleship with 1400mm guns is capable of for alpha dmg.
---
Minny t1 destroyers are hands down the most deadly of any race.   and no other race in the game can ever match Minmatar ships for potential range/alpha combo. even with their autocannons due to falloff range.
---
and Clear Skies says you have no taste if you dislike it.
---
Amarr does have some cool ships 
---
I mean, they’re clearly being sarcastic so
---
The problems are skill injectors for new alts, not high SP "mains".
---
That's actually him... His narration style is just like that really! lol
---
Personally, I've never had an issue with it...
---
I indeed haven’t tried it. I guess I should give them another try :-) 
---
lmaooooo
---
no its not, because none of those ships are any more powerful then all the other titans and faxes in the game, and injecting the ship doesn't make you a good pilot.
---
first time is see a panic button actually affect ships around it 
---
Yeah IN-GAME only that's fine. This guy is doing it in game with out of game assets using twitch as a communication medium which is where he crosses the RMT line in addition to being a scum bag.
---
I identify as a Enyo, take that back!
---
Have you seen the Hurricane? Rifters? Dramiel. Minmatar has some awesome ships! In Rust We Trust.
---
You can already see what cap-less Eve looks like, it’s called hi-sec. 
---
I'm English. We regard sarcasm as the highest form of humour.
---
When you play a game completely devoid of all these "unimportant" fluff objects, you'll see why they are absolutely important.
---
Probably because they fired their community team maybe?
---
no and hell no
---
Delays ruin what makes a stream fun. its us interacting together, im not JUST an idiot infront of a camera. im having fun interacting with/and having the same experience together with everyone who's watching. not 10 minutes later on.
---
For an experiment. go watch bjorn or some other *awesome as fuck* streamer. now delay his shit to a minute or more. then try to interact. with him or others.
---
Not saying its impossible. but it sucks the life and fun out of the stream. and it ruins the interactive nature of streaming.
---
as for the blur, no amount of blurring will stop people finding you. moment you have a kill, they'll find where, and will find you. and you have the choice of letterboxing your stream so only a TIIIINY part is visible.. or not bother.
---
I'm in love with the prophecy, how long can I stick with it in regards to missions, ratting, even solo PvP? Ive not attempted a gala in it yet but would be curious to if I could afford the loss.

Also, why do people prefer the vexor to the prophecy?
---
I am sorry for you

Only 99%? Pff, filthy casual...

This is a bad post and has been REMOVED according to the Shark Week Accords.
---
" Do you really need to be good at flying an Avatar, when you're operating  in a group that guides you into the correct fittings as a requirement.  And there are literally hundreds of you? " And yet inexperienced pilots still manage to lose them on a regular basis with horrible fittings trying to do things on their own. Even large groups who should know better still manage to feed supers and titans due to inexperience.
---
Aw, I worked hard on this :(
---
I love how its almost an exact copy of how a ships shields look in the stargate series.
---
I've thought for a couple years that there should be universal basic fittings already saved for newbros, AND that facwar should give you SRP in the form of pre-fitted t1 frigates built by your nation.  NPC-run srp would really help a lot of new players over the hump, getting them into playing the game and allowing them to think about it later.  
---
happy cake day Davey
---
I don't think they are intentionality making them miserable. What I think is that game Devs in general (not just Eve) have transitioned from designing games out of passion to designing as a job. When this happens they stop asking wether the content will be fun or not and instead focus on the publishers bottom and how they can release sudo-content while still turning a profit.
---
Getting kicked sounds a bit heavy handed, everyone makes dumb mistakes in eve.

Cheers.

Two minute delay on local = bots die.

"id definitely like to look at that at some point"
---
ccp fired them all
---
Minnies are good at what they do.
---
you got autocannons for decent dps with good range and tracking. a middle ground of all and very acceptable.
---
you got artillery for long range, high alpha,  but low dps and tracking is a problem.   
---
and with the exception of frigates,  they typically fast and multi-purpose. able to be used for armor or shield.   and of coarse with no cap needed for guns, they are immune to capacitor warfare shutting down their guns.  they will fire till the ship is dead.
---
they not the most durable,  but they are a very nice combo of all elements.   though the exception to this is the frigates(who suffer from power creep) and the stabber cruiser (its a great speed demon, but its fitting can be limiting)
---
Yes, yes we know. You're not here to ruin the game your here to ruin our game.
---
I'd love eve if they changed everything about sovnull and make sov local something that can be strategically shutdown
---
played for 3 years, i have only met one pinoy player, and he was in a high sec mining corp. i wonder if he is still there
---
when will you stop sperging and post good again?
---
Both sound as bad as each other tbh
---
Yes please :/ also cyno jam FW space. 
---
Yes... and between you and your alts can fly every single ship in game with lvl 4-5 mastery. No need for skill injectors. They are worthless after 80mil sp anyway.
---
thanks gentle towel, very cool!
---
Downvote is also a very creative way of saying "I know there is no proof, but I need to push my narrative and can't answer to that without making up lies".
---
Where PvP doesn't happen
---
That was a fun fight
---
I am not afraid at all, its already here. Its exactly what you named, people who came from casual mmos, who were used to be babysitted all the time by gamemasters and whatnot. Easy gameplay, strict rules as for interactions between players, shity censoring and so on. EVE used to be different a spaceship hardcore mmo sandbox with no rules for those able to whitstand its learning curve and complexity. Nowdays its the exact oposite, learning curve and complexity is being borked down so much that eve a fuckin trained monkey can play and iam not even mentioning dojos like brave, horde or karmafleet. Then you see a wave of posts about CODE. from people who apparently have no idea what this game is all about nor how it works. So for example, iam expecting some sort of gank nerf soon and i could continue...
---
Then a free2play model hit the scene, do you remember the shitstorm? And yet we, who didn't agree, we were right, again. We knew what will happen, some even predicted things which in the end poped up as skill injectors. This is not some bittervet stuff, just pointing facts, its all easy to find on old forums and even here on reddit. So yeah, EVE is different, evolving, sometimes the evolution can go sideways though, just like it did in EVE.
---
Well, its clearly no longer possible to fix this.

GAH GOON BIAS HAT GOONS AHAHAH, shut up idiot.

I guess it took him a few hours to make up the next story about him "not rmting". And botting.

Marshy got banned almost a year ago for vote brigading - but it's actually worse than that. They were going to ban him for vote brigading but I jumped in and prevented the ban because I just finished working with BB a lot to get them a reddit flair. This required a lot more work than meets the eye due to how we had stuff set up. Suffice to say, many hours of my freetime across multiple days were put into it. 
---
Bombers bar didn't even technically qualify for a flair - but I gave it to them anyways for being cool dudes in PM's. Within a week of finishing that up and pushing out their flair Marshy turned a fleet MOTD into "upvote this reddit thread". When I stepped in to stop his ban it was because I wanted to talk to him and explain to him why we have to stop that on reddit and basically just be nice all around.
---
His response was to brigade a bunch of "Goon mod bias" threads about the unjust treatment he received. Basically he flipped around spit directly into my mouth. I was the only goon mod. 
---
That's when I figured you know what - he's right. Marshy did receive "Goon Mod Bias". It's just that bias was *in his favor* because I *liked* bombers bar and wanted to support NPSI in any way I could. 
---
Once marshy got banned he proceeded to make about a million alt accounts and ban evade - many of those accounts are admin banned. He's been banned from here more times than I can count. This is a random screenshot I took several months ago that basically illustrates the Marshy problem:

---
Where do you take such confidence for Frat? They couldn't even evict much smaller BSoD at their perimeter of power which is still well in staging range.   
---
I don't see a lot of their acitivity but shitton of bots running in many systems all over new eden that share the same setup and pattern and that are mostly in their space.. drawing a very clear line that they bot a lof of isk into this game, but thats about it.
---
Ah yes since there are only like twenty people with internet conections in iceland, then all ip's from that barren rock must be ccp people.
---
You know dude if at any point in the past you simply PM'd us politely and talked to us we would have let you keep posting, right? Do you not remember when I went out of my way to get Bombers Bar a flair here despite not qualifying for one and despite the fact that it required recoding a large portion of the bot? Simply because I wanted to support you guys as an NPSI group? We removed 1 thread because it was clear brigading (your fleet MOTD had it linked, telling people to upvote) and the mod who removed it was going to ban you - which is our literal process - but I stepped in and said don't. I worked with you guys before and you were cool about it so just talking to you and explaining why we have to remove those posts would be no problem. You proceeded to lose your shit about goon modbias against you instead. I was the only goon mod. Do you not see the issue here? You were right about the modbias though, we were modbias *in your favor* by helping out BB with the flair and not banning you right away for the brigade. So you did get some goon mod bias - it was just the exact opposite kind you thought. For the record, that same "Goonbias" mod still hasn't removed the BB flair despite having every reason to do so. I don't plan on removing it, either.
---
I have no idea why you decided to take this route with the whole thing. But I was honestly kind of hurt (in a non-crying to mommy sort of way) by the whole thing. If you would have just chilled out a bit and work with people - especially when they *have to enforce certain rules because they are requirements of the platforms they exist on* - things might go a lot better for you. 
---
Instead we're left in a situation where you constantly vote brigade us (something we have to enforce due to reddit admins telling us to - it isn't even our rule!). You constantly ban evade. You constantly spam threads. You even shit up modmail from time to time. Did you ever stop and think that the reason some people don't like you is because, well, you're you?
---
Here's an old screenshot I snagged. Just a taste of what it's like working with you.
---
You're welcome for the flair by the way. Courtesy of "goon bias"

Ships in space go pew pew and this one is like nah
---
What is that link to? I’m just getting a trigalivian core.
---
people are multiboxing rorqs. it wouldnt help. money isnt a factor anymore
---
"Good" doesn't mean "thing I agree with." If this has confused you, you're not alone; the vast majority of responses make this simple mistake.
---
But it is safe because the players living there go through the effort to make it safe.
---
Sandbox game. Works as designed.
---
I can't tell if the title is sarcastic. 
---
I personally don't really care about Rorquals (don't use them nor hunt them) but isn't this exactly what everyone is complaining about?
---
I'm glad you started nuking the dumb shit. CCP deserves to get dumpstered when they fuck up, but the vast amount of bitching is just karma whoring because everybody throws an easy upvote to a rage post. It was getting really old, really fast. 
---
I also hear that we're here, or were here, to point out your apostrophe mistakes. You're welcome.
---
What he did wasn't cheating, thats why he isn't banned. Noone ever debated he was using it, but was it illegal? I just question your thinking pattern, because his group made up this ban for the lolz and you all fell for it.. despite seeig him in all almost all of your systems. So was he ever banned or just on vacation (because noone got ever banned for a week for such things).  
---
I admit, CCP is slow, which is proven by the countless input broadcasting from people controlling 20 rorqs all pulling their drones at once.. or flying 20 mining barges.. (tell me they manually mine for 6 hours when they have to drop ores from minign barges that fill up in about 80 seconds) or just watching the bots all over new eden.   
---
But when he has been banned .. so CCP already has taken action.. why would they unban him when he using illegal ways on over 100 toons? As far as I can tell he is camping regions for a couple years now, how can you ever explain this then without ridiculous conspiracies?   
---
If he'd be using illegal ways its would be so easy to prove for CCP.. not from a screenshot. But somehow.. he is still not banned, I am just begging for a reasonable explanation.  
---
Just don't act suprised when the facts state you are wrong.
---
Wormholes..... Just everything wormholes. It's almost like eve 3 years ago. (In a good way)
---
Checking out checks out

Isn't that against Twitch rules as well ? If I rememebr correctly, could be wrong though, Twitch banned a user for this sort of stuff from another game not too long ago and froze all their account assets at the same time. User was trying to make a big ass thing out of it about them not having the right to freeze his assets and return them, but Twitch won.
---
So maybe Twitch users should report him there as well.
---
Couldn't or didn't really try too hard? I didn't follow BSOD closely. Frat can pull surprisingly good numbers even in off tz if push comes to shove, and are more supercapital heavy than this new coalition. And i believe they are doing much better in terms of industry/economy (bots and whatnot included) than xix and ra, who i pretty much doubt can afford to make any bold moves with potential heavy losses.
---
Maybe with siberian squad they can go toe to toe, but im not sure sibsquad will risk full scale deployment across the whole map (what's their deal anyway? they got themselves situated pretty good up north already)
---
In fact I was thinking when I was looking at it that this shape of shield makes way more sense, it looks like a dense projected electromagnetic field, which would not follow the hull. Like a star trek shield etc.

Almost as good as the time I saw someone on EBAY selling a guide "HOW TO MAKE 10 BILLION ISK IN EVE ONLINE"

The instructions were:

1. Buy this guide
---
2. Convo [character name]
---
3. that character sends you 10 billion isk 
---
The only problem is EA not fighting Belgium govt so that whole EU would have to ban lootboxes when they lost.
---
Would have solved this problem off the bat, make lootboxes an R18 thing and prosecute companies caught selling them in an environment accessible to kids.
---
The sad part is that most people who talk in his chat are gullible and are white knighting him. If you even ask a question about this reddit post you get banned. Except if you agree with him and his made up story. If you wanna read how much of a scum this guy is just read Maulth's comments. And his own comment which has like -50 karma by now.
---
Look, I know my horn isn't as big as it used to be, but I was comprising with another ship recently, and they called it "cute", and I'm ok with that.
---
I appreciate the constructive criticism/other things to consider, I agree with you topic on whales/multiboxing and the issues that has brought. 
---
Unfortunately this is not my video though, it was on my google feed this morning and thought it would make for an interesting discussion on here. Whether or not the conspiracy theory in this video is true.
---
The Levi pilotis patiently waiting for PANIC to drop so that he can DD it in its krabbing face
---
And this does not explain all the people that inject into a big ship and then welp it because they have no fucking clue what they are doing. Are you going to name that pay to lose?
---
your argument is so poor i regret responding to it, go defend ccp in the other 99% of the threads on the board where you'll be welcome
---
Omg yes
---
So lets start.            
---
1. Who cares it don't change a thing          
---
2. Less VNI - less VNI accounts, aka no.           
---
3. ECM was nerfed, drones? Kill them ... this newbie in a drake running from you ?  Well fit ECCM.              
---
4. Hell why not. But cynos are lest of the issue.         
---
5. In theory S citadels will have no tether - also do you really want more structures in space?                
---
A prime example of this is walking in stations. I was said they were going to do this. So every expansion after that was filled with “Where is walking in stations?” Or “When is incarna coming?”  So CCP in their desire to please the masses released a pretty room that melted computer like the original Crysis did. It was an unoptimized mess, and went down hill from there. 
---
But CCP has never been one to layout everything on the table. But they have the feedback section on the forums that hardly anyone looks at, because it is hidden at the bottom.  But even then it isn’t used by the devs all that often is either. 
---
Since a few of you think this is my video it needs to be stated that it is **NOT** my work. This was on my google feed this morning and thought it was worth the watch. At the very least just to draw up a discussion on /r/eve about it to see what everyone's thoughts are. 
---
Dunno if I fully buy into this conspiracy theory but there certainly are some ideas to be considered imo. As we all probably feel, I hope this isn't true and is all just strange coincidence. 
---

Remove damage caps from citadels(or at least raise it)
---
Reduce reinforce times on things like wetus
---
Increase industrial core cycle time(10 min?)but increase fleet hangar and ship bay size.
---
Give mining barges and hulks an extra 1000m3
---
Remove entosis sov

so thats what the brexit was all about?
---
1 word, stiletto

he's selling plex to buy its more expensive to buy it from him than CCP

Test it yourself, grab a ship with 1 of each damage smart bombs, warp to a battleship npc and see what does the most dmg to it.

ITT:  People who do not understand the need to create some level of parity for new players joining Eve in order to fund the servers and development that the old players utilise.  Many old players don't even pay monetarily anymore to play Eve, they're reliant on their ratting/PI/other ways of making money to sub .  
---
There is a natural rate of attrition in all online games,  if Eve Online wants to continue to survive, it has to match, if not exceed its attrition numbers with acquisition.   If you're coming into a game where actual real time itself is the main factor for skill development and most of the people playing have a head start on you and it will take months (if not a full year) to even specialise in one play style, let alone compete with them having speciality in most,  what do you think would happen?
---
The -best- thing to do with Eve I think would be to take either Duality or SISI and offer everyone who wants to play there an absolutely brand new start - all assets stripped, maybe give 10M in skill points just to allow for some degree of speciality and away we go.
---
The biggest problem with Eve is bittervets. 
---
Btw I know it's not anything to do with you're point. the frogs not jumping out of the pot when heat was slowly turned up tends to always leave out the detail that the frogs were labotomized. The ones that were not jumped out of the pot.

you're comments are so full of personal bias I shouldn't have bothered trying to explain the differences on Pay to play schemes to you, clearly can't look past your own preconceived notions.

I’ve been playing on and off since 2010. I keep coming back because I like the game, love the concept and feel like one day I might actually get good.
---
That wasn't an invitation for you to rant.
---
Eve sucks. News at 11!
---
I would rather see the panic module removed from the game before your suggested cyno rebalance or excavator rebalance.  Invulnerability strikes me as a lazy game mechanic to begin with, and the time it buys leads to a lot of the problems with excavator yields and cyno usage.
---
Exactly.. ban him once more while breaking the rules here.. and calling that biased, lmao.

---
Have you read a book recently? :)
---
i have 3 rorqs and im poor as fuck all the time
---
Yeah.  Something about this, coupled with the shitty gambling lootbox event, has really shifted my thinking.  I used to think "hey EVE is pretty good maybe it'll get better or worse, but hopefully better".  Now I think "EVE is still okay but its on the slide, so what's the next game?"
---
1 - no, why make them different from all other mining drones? Ice drones work the way you describe because of how ice mining works, and excavs themselves aren't really the core issue with rorqs, its the insane amount of boosts they can pass on to the excavs, tone down the boosts and the ecavs become less of an issue.  
---
2 - no, all this does is screw over real people playing, the bots won't care that they can only run 4 drones and sites take longer they will still be used.
---
3 - maybe? ECM is always going to need work until they come up with a better way to decide whether you get jammed or not than RNjesus
---
4 - no, leave cynos alone. Once they land on grid the existing issues with Caps will still be a factor, adding a spool up time may cut down on the number of people yoloing supers with tackle cruisers on gates for cheap ganks, but that is the least of the issues concerning cap balance at the moment.
---
5 - great idea, it makes a lot of sense to have tether and docking be different access levels.  
---
Hi Marshy Alt. How are you doing?
---
You do realize that if you want to push the "mods have no proof of brigading!!11!!" someone will just find the last thread posted on your original account and see my comment stickied to the top with proof of the brigade, yes?
---
I, for one, highly recommend you keep pushing that angle because it will be really, really funny.
---
VNIs aren't nearly as much of a plague to space society as Rorquals are.
---
Then you're poor brained
---
&gt; I know there is no proof, but I need to push my narrative

"Pay-to-win. In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items or downloadable content may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise need to spend time progressing in order to unlock said items."

definition taken from wikipedia, but maybe your personal opinions on what pay to win is are more accurate
---
Osttruppen
---
&gt; Its easy to say he is brigading.. while there is no proof for any of this
---
&gt;  and goons having way to many moderators in here not going against that including threats.
---
I don't even understand what you are trying to say Marshy. Take a minute and read your posts before sending them. They are a god damn mess.
---
Rorqs are only unlimited isk makers when you have no need to build anything anymore, eg you have your titan/dreads/carrier and super.
---
Until then you need a fuck ton of money to run them/ pay for the build costs and pay for the fittings.
---
It's a balancing act, only the no lifer are super rich from rorq mining and tbh they prob deserve the isk if they have put that much time in.
---
&gt; Sometimes wonder if being too lazy to RMT everything is the only thing keeping me here
---
Wasn't too hard. Got a nice bit of change, bought a new rifle.
---
1. The bot ratting/mining issue is easy - just add delayed entry into local chat based on the level of space you're in.   at 0.1-0.3 make it a 45 second lag.   at 0.0 make it a 1 minute lag,  at -0.1 and beyond, make it a two minute lag.  That combined with cloaky ships and/or ships that aren't showing on d-scan would allow tackle/point to hit these bots and inflict massive losses to them.
---
2. As for Cynos - if you're within battle and light a cyno beacon, it should effectively only allow for a certain mass of ships to pass through before a secondary beacon needs to get lit.     If you make it so that only one capital ship could get through per cyno light and have a cycle time of subsequent cyno lights,  you'd make it more interesting - let's say you can pass 10-25 subcaps through but only one dread,   and subsequent cynos take another 5 minutes before you can bring another one through - that would fix the "Here comes the cap drop to take out your three frigates"
---
No you can’t. 
---
Yes but it can’t run all the 10/10s they are all different. The Maze you can even do in an Ishtar. 
---
inb4 Goon/Init/Test downvoting.
---
That sounds like 99%
---
5-10 caps aren't exactly hard to kill as it is. They become hard to kill when there's an endless stream of faxes that can be teleported in at will to keep them alive hence this would fix absolutely nothing.
---
make them polarized like this 
---
The vector navy? People love that because you can field 5 heavy drones with it and rat extremely easy with it by speed tanking. Prophecy can’t do that so it’s going to be much much slower. 
---
You can use it for up to level 3 and maybe level 4 missions but it’d be god awfully slow at it. 
---
You could rat it in just fine I’m sure, it gets a great tank but it again would be very slow. 
---
You can PvP with any ship in the game. Battle cruisers are going to warp and align slow though so that’s why you generally don’t see them used for PvP solo. 
---
Can you elaborate please
---
Been a while. Since when we're their immunity bubbles ? How does it work ? Is it a module ? Seems OP. 
---
The channels Beginner Fits and Befinner Fits+ exist, but as I see they aren't linked from the help channel or the Rookie Help chat and these are more PVE than PVP fits.

I just want a limit on citdels and for this super cap meta to die. Nobody should have 20 citadels in one system.

I don’t know what that means. What’s a carebear and f1 pusher?
---
At two sentences in length I don’t think I was ranting. I wonder if you might be overestimating other lengths as well. 
---
&gt;So you're in a catch 22 - say nothing and people assume you've got no plans and you're working on nothing. Give them more information, and you're locked in because folks will go nuts if it changes.
---
Or promise something then do it? Why isn't this an option? 
---
At no point should a few million to hundred million worth of frigates/destroyers stand a chance against 10-20+ billion worth of cap ships. That's like arguing 5-10 guys in kayaks armed with AK-47s should pose a threat to 5-10 guided missile destroyers, it's a comically bad idea.
---
Imagine being this dumb
---
20 keepstars per system sounds like a nice, round number.
---
&gt;Premium ammo when?
---
&gt;CCP: A new turret that shoots plex. Plex is now polarized ammo that ignores shield and armor and does omni.
---
I was following along until I heard player skill still trumps all.  
---
Like...have you ever used a supercarrier to bop a cruiser before? It's trivially easy.  
---
Have you ever run down someone in a dual masb jag before? You just click-approach then face-roll your keyboard until the rest of your blob gets on the kill thanks to a 15sec invuln button. Pretty brainless work.  
---
I urge you to reconsider some of your points.  
---
If goons does that, I'll sing a song for everybody on comms and stream myself eating 100 oreos. ~~Then drop corp and biomass~~
---
its a module that can be put on a rorqual. say a enemy fleet or a capital or super capital npc come into your mining anom. you hit your Pulse Activated Nexus Invulnerability Core (PANIC) module and it gives you 7 min of invuln, with lvl 4 lvl 5 will give you 10% more time, while hopefully your alliance mates are forming a response fleet to come save you.  It will also give this invuln period to any mining ships within 200km of the rorqual. if you are in a large alliance it kinda is broken. but if you are in a smaller alliance it just delays the inevitable. granted even players in mega alliance will fuck it up, cant fix stupid. the mod can only be used one time. once the timer is up it burns itself out and you have to get it repaired and online it again before you can use it.
---
Im fine with the cyno change, to often i run across cheap ships that land, light cyno and die but by then the couple caps jumped. Wont change much for blob fights but helps nano roams at least have a chance.
---
Yeah I know negatives are more vocal. That’s why I am asking for good stories.
---
It’s hard for me as a new player to make the distinction between stupid and genuine criticism about the game. There seems to be a lot of commotion regarding the AT hiatus, is this a bad thing for me? What about capital proliferation? Or the introduction of skill extractors?
---
I still don’t see any of that as problems and I don’t understand their impact because my knowledge of the game and community is very limited.
---
Anyway, I get what you say and you are right. I should probably keep playing and see it for myself.
---
No one is obliged to give you "gud fite". if you roam into someones space then they can drop whatever the fuck they want on you. htfu
---
Look at individual ship resist profiles on that chruker site. Anything else is inaccurate.
---
Angel rats in particular have all sorts of resist and damage profiles, which is why they are harder to tank against.
---
This goes on to sleepers where the damage they deal is split by their weapon systems, meaning you could sig or speed tank certain damage types.
---
To answer your question again: Simple DPS/tank cheat sheets are inaccurate for certain NPCs.
---
not goon or init or test but can confirmed downvoted
---
I dunno man I feel like thats part of it. I staged a few hundred ships near Geminate and just feed the beans, and while I'm super shit at pvp I'm getting better and having fun. Try scrounge up a couple of people to fly with you and just take shit you can afford to replace easily and see what you can do?
---
the answer, as with most problems in eve, is another account
---
Apex Legends has 'premium skins'...
---
That's actually a really bad analogy - it's more like saying "A team of Type VII 10 u-Boats would sink the Bismarck,  at approximately 2% the total cost of the Bismarck'   
---
You know - what actually happened in real world naval battles?   
---
Or if you want,   the idea of 414 light airplanes with 5 small submarines managed to take out 4 battleships, 3 cruisers, 3 destroyers and around 300 aircraft for about 29 losses in Pearl Harbour?
---
History is littered with examples of smaller vessels engaging larger vessels and winning. 
---
And the easy fix there is have Cyno Beacons have a mass limit that means dropping endless streams of faxes is impossible,  versus needing to send sub capital ships yourself in order to fight off their capital roaming fleet.
---
Please return to your rorqual citizen. Rorquals are the foundation of content and contentment. Your rorqual has everything you need. Please return to your rorqual citizen. The rorqual is love. The rorqual is content. The rorqual is spod.

O I see. Ok.

remove rorquals

boom eve is fixed

Can I 'reset' everything and make the game think I'm a bog standard newbie again? I've got a 20.5 million skillpoint character just sitting there I haven't touched since 2012, and I really remember fuck all.
---
It's more a case of "We don't want you destroying our botting ratters and miners, so we'll just ensure that any engagement with us is boring and unfruitful" 
---
Let them drop anything they want, but also make it a far riskier endeavor than it currently is based on fleet compositions and give them reason to also think about sub capital fleets too. 
---
Maulth .... Now theres a name I havent heard in a long ass while. Is he still actually playing Eve ? I saw him on some of his alts here and there on rare occasion and tried to get in touch but without any reply.

99k actually. Never reaches 100k since that's reserved for 100% accuracy, something that can't be feasibly achieved.
---
Those small vessels and planes where DESIGNED with the intent to pick those fights and win by exploiting the known limits of the larger craft. the rifter was not designed to pick fights with Nags/Nids/Rags and win. You're cherry picking historic fights to make your argument seem valid.
---
Goon retardation is good retardation
---
That’s always an option. But people never seem to remember when something is promised and then delivered upon. 
---
Is that a challenge? Cuz someone is gonna take that as a challenge
---
 "you're"  personal unbiased opinions   
---
Can't tell if you're trolling or just failing at trying to grammar nazi me.
---
Exactly my point - have small vessels DESIGNED with the intent to pick the fight with the capital ships that eventually get dropped on them,  to add a new style of danger to the idea that dropping 20B worth of ships is effectively a "We don't want to fight here, go away" clause without any risk. 
---
Please tell me any other fight you know of,  where an invading force were held off by a single aircraft carrier.
---
You know what Aircraft carriers travel with?   Frigates,  Cruisers and Battleships.  I wonder why. 
---
You're forgetting a few things there
---
1) the Bismarck was scuttled after a pounding by the Brits, but they caught it after a lucky strike from a torpedo bomber jammed its rudder and forced it to steam in a circle.
---
2) re: Pearl, TIL a surprise strike against ships in dock against a target who's not at war is representative of most fleet engagements
---
Nice one. Flying the Kiki a lot myself. I can recommend anyone to try it. It's a beast. 
---
I fly it different though. MWD and a point. Do a lot of solo. 
---
Delve salt mining at its finest
---
I should have sold my EQ account, at its height it was worth around $6k but I was too attached to it and now that I haven't played it in ages and never will again its worthless.
---
We already have those vessels they are called stealth bombers and they do the job incredibly well.
---
So you say you did not ban him for his first brigading.. which is not true, because in the past 2 years I've been present in 99% of the fleets (literally) and I've yet not seen once a request for bridaging in fleet from any FC including marshy. So that 1% might have slipped my attention, but.. if he wasn't baned for that one time.. how comes that he still was banned?  
---
Then you call him out for "\[..\] a situation where you constantly vote brigade us \[..\]" which I also fail to see. because it simply never happens.. unless all these incidents are packed into the 1% of the fleets that I've missed.. I wonder how much its true that you have any kind of a good reason and keep on doing that without any.   
---
And if the action of calling for votes in the game affect the ban in this sub..  would you also ban goons that say "I hope your mother dies in sleep today" on this platform?  
---
Why would he talk to you about that, asking nicely (lol) to not get banned when you fail to bring evidence for a good reason to (PERMA!!)ban him in the first place while so badly enforcing rules here when people that don't like getting called out for their bullshit start a shitshow of slendering and never face any consequences?  
---
Nice that you didn't ban him right away, but this seems to be standard procedere for everyone else. Why not for him? Why are you telling me you've arched your back to not ban him when basicly noone gets banned for that.. while.. in reallity he was banned right away.   
---
All this makes the story really hard to belive for me that you are not abusing your powers as a mod. When you face critice you can't answer you silence people. Thats how it looks like. And it fits perfectly into this whole marshy thing.   
---
He might have once told people to down-/upvote, but thats about it. I don't think that this justifies a permaban and everything that followed is due to your abuse of power and you can't really suprised about someone trying to go around that. You can't blame a prisioner for trying to break free. Your repeated ban justified by a violation, which it really isn't a violation when it stands to debate if your initial ban is justified at all.  
---
When BB killed a Darkness Titan the post (including AAR) was quickly removed. A post about how goons killed a Titan and Init saving the remaining Titans quickly rushed to the tops... even if they barely took any part in the whole fight. 3 groups where activly killing the titan and goons only came in with the lightest ships at the very end of the fight barely doing any dmg just to whore on the titan. Again everything is about goons. Every other factual narrative gets deleted while the rules where followed perfectly. Weird,isn't it?  
---
I personally got banned form the GSM dicsord because one of your beloved goonlings repeatedly said that the stargates and the jumpgates are absolutly the same which I debated with the acutaly facts and he had nothign to add to the conversation but "Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee" (in the serious discussion channel!!) I was calling him out for beeing silly.   
---
And don't get me wrong, I like to type that "Reeeeeeeeeeeeee" too, but .. If I get the discord rules right, if anything then abusing the rules of a specific channel is the only bannable offense that has happend.
---
Again a violation of rules from a goonling without any consequences and a ban for someone that criticized that without any discussion or justification or even a message why I was kicked/banned.  
---
Its just goons just get away with everything in here because they got their mods in here and every other platform. Just a little slip from everyone else faces a permaban without any consideration or call for  behavior (which I still would argue in my case, not so in marshy's).  
---
And I'd bet my hands on the fact that I will get downvoted like crazy with weak arguments while noone can explain to me how it is okay to type lines of "reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" into a serious discussion channel is okay but calling someone out for that is a bannable offense.. which just further proves my point that goons hold to much power over the social media sections of Eve and abusing their power by beeing **extremly** picky.
---
I was on a fleet while talking to this guy, missed a drop because it was just too good not to carry this conversation on with him.
---
Bots aren't in standing fleets calling for help. Your premise is disingenuous, but then, you know that.
---
Also vast majority of it wasn't people professionally farming or botting it but rather veteran players selling off as they moved to other games, thus it caused no where near the damage to their respective game economies. 
---
At the height of account worth of my EQ account, EQ didn't even have any sort of market system in it, all trades were done by people gathering in EC on weekends at prime time and spamming / yelling over each other.
---
  
---
Space communism, not even once.
---
I'm not forgetting them at all - the reason the Bismarck example comes into account is that ten of the Type VII u-Boats would have scuttled it regardless of any "luck" - the reason that example comes up a lot in military history is because many people believe if the funds that went into deploying the Biscmarck went into deploying more u-Boats,   it would have been a massive factor in Germany continuing their naval dominance and supremacy and made later stage landings by the allies impossible
---
2.   Re Pearl - absolutely right,   it takes time to get big ships and fleets together,  the idea that you can just "light the beacon" and drop a ship fully prepared to tackle that situation is ridiculous.   
---
Found the Botter.
---
Thanks for taking the time to explain, I appreciate it. How much do those modules cost ? Definitely seems like it pretty much makes large corps invincible but the small guys still get fucked. How could they not see that happening?
---
"If you know what you are doing"
---
i.e if you find a capital out by itself and manage to surprise attack it, point it and by some miracle not have any others come to help out. 
---
Yes, bombers can take out capitals (eventually) - how often does it happen?
---
pretty soon it'll be "we ruined the game"
---
&gt;My dreadbombs resulted in coalition failcascades, mass exoduses of alliances, the dissappearance of corporations from games, and entire regional economic crashes
---
tbh, not an entirely inaccurate flex
---
Beep boop, call theta
---
If you are still poor then expand you risk making setup till you are not and then buy your Titan etc. 
---

I'd say he makes some interesting points and his conslusions are well thought out, however there are a lot of things that he's not mentioning that certainly contribute to the problem at hand: Botting, increased safety in null, rorqs/carriers, f2p etc.
---
Again his stuff is well thought out with the data he has but I'm willing to bet that there is also some correlation to (for example) how many players scaled up their income to a point (thanks to rorq mining/capital ratting) that they didn't need to pay for this game anymore and instead plex their accounts. Think about what happens when lots of players go down that route then add to this an influx of players lured in by the f2p model etc.
---
If only bots could potentially do this quickly at 99% accuracy
---
&gt; But you know what saltyvets could do? They could spread out away from corps that have become well known centers of wealth accumulation.
---
Fundamentally one of the things hurting Eve the most from a player perspective is that established players would rather be comfortable than try to do a new startup or go out and create content for people outside the safe bubbles. It's really frustrating, but human nature. 
---
So you were slap fighting each other in local and decided to share to us on reddit. Cool.
---
I believe someone needs to setup 2FA.
---
The land system was so fun.. aside from the land grabbing bots, once you had a nice farm setup, it was like christmas waking up and being a carebear pve chopping trees picking fruit and hauling larders.. rip
---
Thanks!
---
We still are waiting for the prove of any of those bold claims like he was asked for that multiple times.. untill its just sperging.
---
I feel you missed the point of his research and supporting evidence, or else you didn't watch the entire video.
---
There is a difference between a correlation of data pointing to Plex price increase, and the set of 4 data points where we can point to Plex, Injectors and event items jumping in price at the exact moments CCP announces or changes something.
---
If we were looking at Plex as a 3 year window ending in September 2018, you would be correct. The fact that we have had another 30% increase in just the last 4 months, along with the decisions made by CCP that actively expressed the trend, means you are not seeing the big picture.
---
I think they actually ARE intentionally making them miserable... well sort of: They have stated that events give them an opportunity to experiment, see what players like. Of course then you're not going to see the same event structure over and over, even of players liked it. Based off of feedback they are then trying to get ideas for new, permanent content.
---
Yeah, hk is dead now. Unlike your boys, who are thriving. 
---
Log into your Imperium rorq alt: war room -&gt; Declassified History: The BBTB3 forum post that lead to the Northern Deployment
---
They can probably do the 'test' samples [the ones they keep repeating] that quickly.
---
I did watch the entire video but my comment was mainly referring to the points he makes about the increased plex prices and general accelerated inflation.
---
Bring it forth.. wait.. HE made post about he did something that makes that thing real?   
---
Hey, I've created the world.. prove?
---
The problem is capitalism.
---
It always ends up, from the perspective of someone trying to satisfy shareholders and "meet expectations" as META (Most Effective Tactic Available) for making money or GTFO.  Any time you get shareholders involved, they'll keep demanding more and more and more return for less and less investment, and make you cross more and more lines in order to get it, until you eventually fail.  There is no such thing as "successful enough" for these people.  Even if they got all the money and owned all the things, they wouldn't be happy.
---
I dont have to he's right there, look at him. Wow. 
---
It hasn't smudged after a year so the ink pen must have been top tier
---
No its safe because ccp bent every single rule of the game for that to be the outcome
---
Theres no to long to stop, i played long. I stopped. Easy. They deserve neither my money or my time atm.
---
&gt;HE made post about he did something that makes that thing real?
---
No.  Jeeze, just login and look for yourself.  2nd page, ezpz.
---
"Upvote (if you wish) \[..\]" Hardly qualifies as brigading. WOW.  
---
Btw. I am not Marshy, you don't need to look for justification for banning someone who calls you out for your bullshit.
---
Academy of the Unseen Arts [ART5] .....for real though??? Just get the fak out of my sight pleb.
