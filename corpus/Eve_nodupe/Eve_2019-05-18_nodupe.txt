Yeah, I‚Äôm on board with coming up with a real isk sink. Just have no clue what that could be. The only real isk sinks they can manipulate are taxes and skillbooks prices. I suppose they could link the titan and super skillbook price to number of titans in the game, thus putting a soft limit on number of supers in existence. But the outrage would be crazy lol.

We need new skins for logi ships like the Burst, Scalpel, Scythe, and Scimitar!

Don't play alone and others will help with maintenance/defense of your out-of-the-way home. :) WH life *does* take more time for logistics (scanning, more scanning, and yes, even more scanning)(then more scanning), but certainly leads to smaller fights and limits what larger groups can do to you (they *can* still get to you, but it takes *way* more effort for them than it's usually worth).

Hahaha, okay, this guy!

**Backstory:** So, a rogue slave trader, Orlon Zashev, was recently implicated in a number of crimes in the Amarr Empire (contrary to popular belief, the Amarr do in fact have some pretty strict rules about who and where you can take slaves from) and potentially working with some enemies of Amarr. He escaped from custody of the Ministry of Internal Order (basically the Amarr's FBI), but got captured by a Thukker mercenary who then put him up for public auction among capsuleers.
---
**What happened today:** A coalition of Amarr-aligned corps had won the auction and negotiated a time and place for Zashev to be turned over. When we did, figures from two competing Amarr factions - the Order of St. Tetrimon, formerly considered heretics in the Empire, and the Ministry of Internal Order - appeared to have a spat about who would take responsibility for Zashev. Our inquisitor is a CCP-controlled character representing the latter group, and is here leveling accusations at the Tetrimon Order - from whom a similar character was present as well.
---
Against these two competing groups, a fleet of Amarr-aligned pilots from the alliances Khimi Harar, Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris, Curatores Veritatis Alliance, and others pushed back: We would only hand Zashev over to a representative of Arrach Sarum of the Sarum Family, who is currently carrying out an investigation into the whole thing. Needless to say, neither the Tetrimon nor MIO representatives were happy about this.
---
**tl;dr**: A criminal did some bad stuff, Amarr players got ahold of him, and 2 major Amarr groups got into a power play over who he belonged to.
---

What is a crap ton of ISK.... Well in a game like EvE it is hard to tell. Better measure of wealth is the buying power you have. How much assets you have/can buy.
---
Not going to disclose my wallet numbers but I would say 500B. Not unimaginable as I know 5 people who have that much liquid and maybe 3 times as much in assets.
---
It's great that you think you can use buzzwords (e.g. "full-stack dev") and insulting the current and former employees (implying none of them understand their code, how to code in Buzzword, and/or that they don't have brains) to oversimplify an issue and state, with no knowledge of the system's design, code, or it's idiosyncrasies, how long it will take to fix. Sure, could be as simple as "Oh, we just need to slightly modify our database schema and that will be an easy fix!" or they just need to migrate from a single PostgreSQL instance to multiple syncing masters and slaves behind a load balancer, but I doubt something with as many ties into how EvE Online works is that simple to fix.

Wanted to self build a capital shipyard because I really like industry - sadly the changes to the game made mining and industry childs play - not a bad thing as such, but rather ruined the appeal of it to me
---
Been doing this for the past year. These past few months have been the toughest. I've had to downsize from 3 accounts to just a main. Still possible without logging in and ratting or mining everyday though.
---
These look absolutely stunning. So sad something like this isn't retailed. Would be awesome to paint.
---
What method would you prefer they do which would be effective but not cause a meltdown by valid players IE captchas when mining.
---
How much do you want for the whole set?
---
Test is as welcome as any other goon sig.
---
If they keep this up, in the future we can just feint and they'll blow themselves up.  We don't even have to do anything.
---
Hilariously accurate, though I can tell you as a guy who did low level strat ops for a null group half the time I didn‚Äôt get my objective until we were 1-2 jumps out from target system. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different at a higher level.

I haven't played EVE in a few years. But played for about 9 years until I stopped in 2016. I did small gang like you, and every year it felt just that much harder to find people who were willing to fight. I got the itch again and it coincided with this AMA, and have to say after reading this that I am quite sad. It seems like CCP is completely clueless as to what to do. Too many people have caps now, and that problem was made exponentially worse with injectors.
---
Let's hope CCP can find a way to facilitate small groups owning small pockets of SOV again. These massive power blocs and cap proliferation is killing the game, and it's just sad. We're at a point where a big risk like an EVE 2 with some new systems that are modernized and make PvE actually fun and something people want to do may be the right thing, as drastic as it sounds.
---
I want to come back, but seeing the player count so low now compared to w hat I was used to, the countless list of small gang corps that are now defunct, and the lack of will of the sov holders to fight small gangs I just don't see myself coming back. It's sad too because the Trig ships were made for small gang it looks like, but what's the fun in using them when people don't need to fight you (can't blame them). Well I hope SOV holding nerds enjoy farming ISK to save for their Titans that will then just collect dust. We just saw that even the big groups don't want to fight anymore. RIP EVE :(

tbh they'd not be much of an asset, given the  losses to Frat, and Snuffed, and Horde.

Maybe Test could guard Delve while the other sigs deploy. A sort of "home duties" team to keep the krabbers safe.

Actually epic and actually very excited for this. Hell yeh!

Considering I rarely die in delve, my death clone is set to wherever I'm staged.

That actually explains a lot about Dust. Tho them freezing the new project gives mixed signals

First, the 20k was half if current population estimates, did the math early for you.

Also, you have still failed to show how over half of the player base is in on your shitty idea.

As for the rest, I mean, as much as I'd love for that kind of thing to be present in the game, how certain are people it's worth the effort given say, Jester's post which essentially gives the impression CCP wouldn't bother doing anything that cool for the playerbase?
---
lol
---
Hmm. Think I'll go buy more skill injectors.    
---
And plex.
---
Yeah. Get a ship and put beam lasers on it, and put different colored crystals in each gun, then go shoot something with it. The laser beam that comes out is the color of the crystal.

There's 8 different colored crystals, so if you have an 8 gun ship, you shoot a rainbow.

I'm so fucking classy that when I go to take a piss, you hear a sploosh as my 10 pound cock flops into the water and excretes that lovely gold liquid known as piss. My dick is so heavy that I have to wear a special chastity belt that locks around the head of my cock as to not drag itself down tearing a hole in my gucci pants. That's how fucking classy I am. How many women can say they sucked a cock made of gold? The ones that dare. They suck is so much and when I blow my load, it's like they finally found the end of that magically fucking rainbow they've been chasing all their life. My jizz is so fucking special that it makes all their daddy issues disappear when I blow my 10 karat load on that lovely little chin of theirs.

---
So next thing you're going to tell me is that implementing a chat system is an insurmountable feat. Dude. They. Failed. To. Implement. A. Stable. Fucking. Chat. That's Helloworld level of tool knowledge that they failed to clear. So when you as a team struggle to implement load balancing for a goddamn chat, that should be a red flag to the dev lead, and if he doesn't deal with it, it should be a red flag to his boss and so on. There are multiple points of failure here, all failing. 
---
So don't feed me the bullshit about their plight, they've been doing this for two decades, and user base has not been increasing for the last five years.
---
All I see is incompetence at using the tools they have (regardless of how genius they are as developers), which is then not in any way dealt with on team lead or managerial level, and Hilmar as a fuckwit cherry on top that doesn't know how to run an MMO developer business, regardless of how genius the is as a CEO in general. 
---
Also, a lateral db change would not have affected any of the issues you've brought up, just shows that they're afraid you touch the code, that they clearly don't fully understand.
---
No, you can only see what is given. You can‚Äôt use the search function to search for alliances, corps, characters, systems, regions, constellations or anything at all. Don‚Äôt try it won‚Äôt work.

1. You can join any major nullsec groups relatively easy. I have friends in Horde and Karmafleet alike, who are all happy where they are at the moment and won't leave their spots too soon.
---
2. You can go into nullsec with just enough to buy a VNI, however, I guess the most big nullsec corps have enough helpful members or programs to get you ships for free. There's always someone who's relinquishing a ship in favor of an upgrade.
---
3. You go there by remotely assigning a new home station and then comitting suicide. (suicide jump)
---
4. Markets are 50/50 to deal with, I know for example Goons have a very lively market down in Delve. I don't know much about the other alliances, but I bet they have a good infrastructure to fill your newbie needs.
---
5. Joining one of the major corps usually comes with obligations. You'll be requested to take part in mandatory fleets from time to time. The attendance may vary from alliance to alliance. If that is nothing for you, look for a renter corp. There are a lot of renters who are also accepting and caring about their newbs.

That's cool

What kinda C2 you got? What type do you recommend for below battlecruiser style fights? Above?

I guess when you're ordered to stay docked through any real fighting, being allowed to take out friendly POS modules must be a real treat.

I actually ran into a recruiter for Razor right after World War Bee. I was like "Holy crap! I found Razor!"

zKillboard does URL filtering.  I had a guide, but then I lost it, so I'll have to explain myself.

You can add filters based on:
---
* Character, corporation, or alliance
---
* Ship or ship group
---
* System or region
---
* Security (high, low, null, wh, abyss)
---
* Probably more that I'm forgetting about / have not used (+5 / +10 bill, awox / gank / solo tags, capitals)
---
You can add one filter from each of these groups.

You need to have +5's in your clone for over a year to get back the SP. If you do a lot of pvp and lose implants often it's not worth it. Might be cheaper to use +4's and just buy sp. Depends on how you play the game.

I don't fully understand how this is simultaneously such utter shit and also the best thing I've seen in a very long time. It just has that amazingly perfect mix of shitty horrible animation and extensive knowledge of EVE, memes and cinema history in general.

They used to be mighty long ago and respected \[and made really cool propaganda\], now they are trash living on past glories bereft of those corporations that made the great and at the behest of entities that are themselves no longer great. Still better than Intrepid Crossing though.

Years and years ago when I was new I talked to someone at Eve University. They told me to start training the magic 14. I set them up in my queue and logged out and waited. After months of training I logged back and applied to Eve University. Told I was too old. Lol. Oh well.

Only tip I'll give you is: make your own goals.  Most people will tell you what you "should" do.  Don't.  Explore the game at your own pace and do what YOU think is the next step.  If you feel "stuck"  you can talk with someone you've met along that way to suss it out.  Remember, EvE is about YOUR journey, not the journey someone tells you to take.  BE the story!
---
I just trialed my T3C through Angel Extravaganza Bonus room with 1 warp out, so close to the "perfect fit" for mission grinding.  My goals are my own and are a blast!

I'd say the opposite. Join horde first, and if you dont like it you at least have something to do while you wait a week for karmafleet to process your application. 
---
And realistically, people who go straight for karmafleet are a lot more likely to be spies than people who jump around a bit, so its not going to hurt his application any

Shit I guess I haven't fully thought out any long-term goals, but I guess I only have a couple: get really, really technically skilled at all facets of subcap PvP, and find the right people and corp for me long-term. Still got a long ways to go on the former and the latter is a moving target over time I suspect, but I'm having fun :D
---
We don't drop caps on people we like, or at least don't dislike, coming to fight us for content. We don't really like goons at all and its not like you're going to stop coming regardless of how many caps we drop, so we do drop caps on you.

I'm against removing dead cloning because of the high stakes fights, like high stakes fights are the own kind of fun, like those fights where if you fuck up it matters are really not all that common anymore. 
---
Making blown up not matter anymore would change the dynamics as the hostiles now only really show up for structure timers as the majority of your loot generally comes from afks in the first place so you tend to not really hole control to prevent asset extractions as much as you hole control to prevent re-enforcements.
---
Now what would medical clones do: 
---
It would remove hole control completely as there is almost no point, this means the attackers are gonna be docked up for most of the eviction, just waiting for timers. 
---
Even if the defenders wanted to fight now they have nothing to shoot at other then a citadel, this is an attacker picked time. 
---
There is also the reality of not undocking generally only happens if the defenders feel they have 0 chance against the attackers and really in those scenario's I don't really mind the attackers not getting there fight as generally the attackers choice to attack for loot rather then for a fight ( if you want your defenders to undock bring something they can fight this isn't rocket science ). 
---
All of this goes away in favor of well another battle on a citadel set time, really if you like those there are plenty of places where you can already get those.

I'd be curious to see how active your zKill is. I'm happy you're enjoying the game, but the pessimist in me doesn't believe living in a c2 is going to get you much action unless you're c2-ns-c5.

It's been a thing for over 20 years.  Renaming it is not exciting.

Is Albion actually any good? I feel like EVE is on the down and am having a hard time shaking the itch to play again. Just feeling meh about going back to an EVE that is more dead now than it was 2 years ago when I last played.

Looks nice! C2-NS-C5 then yeah? If so I can understand the appeal, I was one of the first to move a small gang corp to one of those WH's when I ran Furnace with my co-CEO/founder Vordak. We got a ton of action thanks to the static NS and it was easy to roll.

actually HS, C3.  The C3 will have a low or null static 2/3 of the time. We have on average 2ish connections to null or lowsec in our chain plus statics. The problem is less with getting connections and more with it being hard to small gang in null these days
---
Half of the FB group are goons and the other half are high sec carebears
---
You can see why they'd have a lot in common.
---
wouldn't it be easier to sit 119 stabbers cloaked on a rorqual and wait?
---
Oh surprising but I see how that could work. That's nice having the HS to make logistics a bit easier. Totally know how hard it is to small gang in null, it's half the reason I quit 2-years ago. Happy to see any kind of PvP corp make it in w-space, especially something like a C3-HS. Good hunting!

"Space" is more or less under Maritime Law and under Article 101 of the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, piracy is defined as "any illegal acts of violence or detention" The argument could be made that the crew of Skylab 4 committed an act of piracy when they "went on strike" during the mission which therfor would make them the first ever space pirates.

T2 an T3 destroyer hulls are also excellent and valuable for PvP. You could quite plausibly be a specialist in those and be welcome in almost any fleet
---
How do you think they survive the ice giant many years ago
---
Super ironic coming from an alliance that was putting like 4 dudes in fleet on a good day. Considering I actually FC'd right up until the deal was made, including the last fleet before we surrendered I think that I'll trust my own experience over some rando who's alliance died to spies.
---
Is that a coalition vs corp fight?
---
empire building is, more or less, the same story as a supercap brawl. 
---
thanks to the rorqual, we got a ship with basically no counters. it is almost indestructible with panic, is highly efficient, scalable to absurd levels and even few solar systems can house a lot of players. 
---
it is the same n+1, and since goons have more chars rorqual mining than ncpl has overall players at any time of the day, theres nothing to do for anybody. 
---
and concerning the supercap fights: they only have gotten so big because these retarded rorqs make building the titans so easy.
---
5 and 6/10s are way, way more profitable than the nullsec sites.  Most valuable drop from 10 is like 400m, from 6 is 1.2 bil.

Its just slightly above 500mil isk. It just requires a good piloting and decent module management, like for example overheating the thermal hardener against the harder vedmak spawns and you need to take a improved bluepil + hardshell before going into T5 and reroll the booster if get the capacitor penalty.

They used to matter, time has worn away their reputation.
---
If your are on the Station, you want to change clones at, your till then active clone, will go into the clonebay, and you will activate the one that has been in the clonebay.   
---
So lets say you are on a keepstar, have a clone with high-grade slave you are actually sitting in. on the same station is another clone, thats empty, and on another station in this system you have your skill clone. 
---
Now there are 2 possibilites:  
---
If you clonejump into the other one, your high-grade slave would go into the clonebay, destroying the empty one, and you'll wake up on the other station with your clonejump.  
---
If you clonejump into the one on the keepstar, the high-grade slave is in the clonebay, and you are sitting in the empty one.
---
The active clone will always put into the clonestation. Only in one case it won't:
---
Your clonebay offers the possibility to selfdestruct a clone. 
---
If you push this button, your active clone will be destroyed, and you will wake up in you homestation, in a new clone.
---
Hope this was helpful

Not sure why that got downvoted, but in seriousness-- *don't* tell me what to do. I want to run it through Steam. You telling me not to, because you don't do that, or whatever your reasoning is, doesn't matter to me and is irrelevant. It does not solve my issue.

Don't get your panties in a bunch. Steam and eve has always had issues and eve has a standalone launcher so why bother using the steam one when it always has a tonne of issues for people? just search for eve steam problems, not as if it's not well documented....oh wait...

---
What supports did you use?
---
I will wager to say what i think: You are wrong about the rorqual and here is why. 
---
Its not the ship its the people and this is my reasoning.
---
The rorqual is not unbeatable, tens die per day. What makes them hard to kill is organizing a proper fast response fleet. 
---
People, make people safe, no you cannot wipe a rorqual in delve space or any other space for that matter if you are in a fleet that is weak with no proper planning (think counter drops and not roaming). Plan against the defense fleet and you will have success. 
---
Do not expect your small roaming fleet to win against people in their own home land.
---
If you insist in thinking its the ship rather than the organisational power a group of people go mine in a rorqual solo and see how invincible it is.
---
Yes goons are horrible because they keep organizing themselves. boo-hoo. You can be too, stop thinking small.
---
Also the argument that goons have more rorquals means nothing, as you well stated rorquals are scalable, the others refuse to build due to misguided elitism.
---
May i please remind you that when goons came to delve they had none of it and in a single year they had a powerful industry core set up. Others can do as well, open your gates take the spod eaters treat them nice and power will flow thru your super cap armada. 
---
At a certain level of rorquals you can happily produce tens of supercaps per day, and if were to sit and to the math you would probably be amazed its not that many as one would think. 
---
No army in real life stands without industry, its the same thing here. Pls adapt.
---
The horror!
---
You could do that with alts. Nowadays I guess it's considered solo.
---
Wanted to become filthy rich bought PLEX and sold DONE!
---
Wow, smallest alliance had lowest fleet numbers
---
That would be dumb and broken.
---
LS is still active, both PvP and mining and getting rid of an exploitable  passive income was great!
---
The game should be active.
---
I agree with the siege concept, sure. But as you said, the umbrellas make them isk printing factories. Sure some committed individuals commit enough to take rorqs down, but they continue to trash the economy.
---
It would.  But can you imagine how utterly tedious it would be for people who aren't botters to deal with.
---
sir my hat goes of to you. THAT WAS A QUALITY SHIT POST OF GRADE A+++ PROPORTIONS.
---
Good luck finding an empty C2-C5/NS or C2-C6/NS.  When Suddenly were moving into one, it transpired that all but maybe 3 were occupied.
---
Though C3-NS can work.  Logistics will be harder, but there are a few decent groups living in them.
---
I think most null corps that have been in alliances for a long time degenerate and are incapable of organizing stuff themselfes.
---
Without their own FCs, strong leadership and a active core of players without drama they would quickly die in the good space.
---
He should be handed over to the Sixth Empire.
---
Thank you!!
---
I don't see how, what CPU?
---
Also I am now imagining some kind of EVE tabletop starship game.
---
the fuck is this
---
For wormholers the best situation is rolling into another active wormhole. If you cant get that then you go to low or null. Thing is the amount of players it takes to make null feel full and busy is much more than the amount needed in a wormhole. So a large scale movement of players into wormhole space will actually make the game feel much more full and lively
---
Those are the best for hunting in nullsec, but I was hoping more to get more pvp corps into wh's so that we don't even need the null connections for content anymore (long term goal). making highclass wh space full would be awesome
---
I do agree that most become shells of their former selves, however i think that there definitely are some out there that want to and can pull off the move
---
You are gonna go far, kid
---
I had to work, so I watched it disappear.
---
uninstall steam, reinstall
---
Ah yeah.  That would be nice tbh.  Lived in a C2-C5/NS, then C4-C2/C4 and now a C2-C5/NS again.  Yet I've had very few fights in w-space.
---
I want to form a nomadic small/medium hull gang of skilled pvpers using orcas and Deep space transports as mobile bases.
---
yes, ran the numbers myself
---
I gave it to my new skill farming alt so she can hit 6mill SP next month before her MCT is up and I can finally get some return on my questionable investment.
---
Thanks that's very helpful
---
thats the problem with all this, narratives instead of content
---
Absolutely, I made the same choice the first time I joined.
---
I know nothing :D
---
Respect
---
I'll give that a shot. Thanks for the real reply :)
---
So the doctrine fleet comp is 50% drakes using various types of ammo, and 50% kitchen sink anything? Looks innovative and efficient.
---
It is a coincidence I'm using same directory for digital assets in Adobe AE. This is a good library, although I'm still in search for old asymmetric scorpion hull, as it was in the past.
---
&gt; public auction
---
winning bid was apparently 200btw
---
Welping ceptors and faction frigs is a sign of a rich player!
---
Also hold down Q and a strait line will appear between your ship and mouse pointer. Click once to set distance/direction (if it were a graph the X and Z coordinates) and a second time to set Y coordinates. 
---
Your ship will stop at the distance you click and begin to turn around and move back to that point.

Tldr please

When you start, you do not go to fight the biggest guy, you start building your empire. Then you start taking bigger and bigger enemies until you are the biggest. Think it the other way around, Goons were a small entity first and then they took over (oversimplified). Maybe in 5-10 years your coalition will too.
---
EVE is about goals and long term achievements. Exactly because you don't start from the same line as everyone else, makes it interesting. Do it simply and get a spy in big alliance and steal all their assets or make drama and miss information or just plainly start ratting in your VNI and grind to the top. There is a huge number of vastly different paths.
---
As in real life, you don't make huge differenct by playing by the rules and beeing a good worker bee and grinding and grinding in your job. That will not make you rich (not in game or in real life). You need to come up with more innovative aproaches.
---
EVE is economical and policital simulation. You could say that it has nothing to do with spaceships in the end. The players behind huge things play most of the time away from the game client.
---
how's that going on in chinese server? I recall it being big blue donut for half a decade now
---
The fact that TX keeps electing this clown tells me everything I need to know about TX
---
it's laser surgery.
---
Whetes the bindy :P
---
they have great price to dps ratio and are still fast to warp, the next plateau of value are battle-cruisers then next one carriers and dreads
---
I expected a zoomed in part of the Inquisitor frigate hull ngl
---
Honk/10 would join if ceo stops ratting in marshals
---
Thankfully they don't cost nearly as much as they did back when he made the video.
---
Don't do exploration in Imperium sov, Delve is crap for data and relic sites anyway, Fountain is a little better but you would have a better chance going to Stain or Catch
---
Why?
---
I wanted to be able to do every single piece of industry required to build tech 1 ships, rigs and modules I used on the cheap - and by that, I mean, mining, reprocessing, hauling, have the blueprints researched, you name it.
---
I got burned a few times when I got stuck in a place where I needed X, but X wasn't available there, and I couldn't haul X into there either.
---
I still suck at mining and reprocessing, and building things isn't something I'm *good* at - but I've got the hauling part nailed, and I'm good *enough* at the other parts that I can make blueprint copies of my originals and fly them out somewhere to build something if I need to.

Hey, some people have weird ammunition needs, we‚Äôre just the messenger!
---
&gt; 3. "Have you heard of the CSM?"
---
Outside of Null Sec, I believe the answer, "No," would definitely exceed 50%.
---
&gt; "... does the CSM provide value to the players?"
---
I think the answer has always been largely, "No." I think Null Sec votes more as a representation of their alliance, coalition, etc and to make sure that if there is a voice, that it is their voice being heard.
---
When I ran for CSM, I was hit by a wall of apathy. The highest responses were along the lines of, 'It doesn't matter, they can't change anything,' and, 'They are just a public relations gimmick.'
---
DO you know if CCP is doing anythign about it? bc i see Multiboxing by Chinese in Ice Belts in empirium Everyday and always the same Nickanmes....
---
In all seriousness, don‚Äôt ask the community for help and then act like a twat
---
Straight optimism. I love this game for a variety of reasons and keep hoping they add more cool stuff.
---
Glad l can help thats what /r/eve is for fly safe buddy
---
One is Gallente propaganda and the other is Amarr's.
---
i dont think thats how it works....
---
I had not seen this but you should be aware, if you are not already, that propaganda in EVE Online is a real and tangible thing.
---
If you stick around you‚Äôll find out soon enough.
---
I am glad I had my sound off.
---
&gt; hurts the good guys (Goons) and defies the glorious leader (the Mittani)
---
Are you joking or deluded? I can't tell from what you have written.
---
Gallentes are french colonist descendants. Would you trust the french? No, so why you trust their propaganda?
---
This is an incredibly good work! Do the same with other ship class now ;)
---
&gt; two-week sprints
---
Oh dear god, tell me CCP isn't using Scrum! :o
---
You can solo ventures in catalysts
---
Yeah nah I'd rather annoy bigblocs than be isk negative to piss off dome noobies
---
Iceland does not owe itself to a good shipping hub. 
---
But then we're just getting back to them being mongoloid shut ins
---
bah gawd /u/rageliner had a family
---
Amarr are religious fanatics.
---
Would you trust a fanatic? No, so why you trust their propaganda?
---
And trust Space Catholics instead hellbent on a crusade?
---
Of course! God is on our side, why would we lie?
---
OP probably doesn't realize that "amg a gril on the internet" was tired 15 years ago and isn't a notable event.
---
Enjoy your walnuts.
---
and this is why eve is great ;)
---
You don‚Äôt get unallocated sp when you‚Äôre not training, do you?
---
Or did you make a ticket and a GM gave you unallocated sp for all the missed training?
---
Puny God.
---
Would you trust anyone in eve na
---
Burn the heretic!
---
One a good day, I might trust myself.
---
On the average day, not even that far.
---
Now you can buy the rust skin, leave it in a hanger, and RP that it rusted from lack of use!
---
Literally unplayable
---
yikes
---
Coming straight from the Path of Exile sub to this one can really blur the lines sometimes.
---
Also ***PRAISE***
---
that's cool...I guess.
---
I joined like 2010. The Uni had some crazy rules back then. We weren't allowed to enter nullsec at all, not even NPC nullsec. We were strictly NRDS. We were required to base at the central campus in Aldrat.
---
The wartime rules were crazy too, but in hindsight I have come to appreciate them. It wasn't "don't undock during war", it was "don't undock except in a PvP ship in a PvP fleet". The result of this being highly centralized and focused on fighting against wardeccers was that we tended to dominate in wardecs, and got loads of good content that way.
---
Todays more decentralized, less focused, less rule-driven Uni is probably better than the old days, but some things were lost along the way too.
---
FYI [EVE UNI Wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) is the main wiki for EVE.
---
Also fandom is bad.
---
CCP is doing something, but the consensus over here from my observation is that the scale of the problem is far larger than the scale of response from CCP so far.
---
This is good stuff. Thank you. I always enjoy your posts.
---
oh my god
---
I honestly wouldnt mind if local bugged out like here and there, it would be like a purge, as for the most part the only ones who really care about local are krabs and bots. it'll cull the weak from the herd.
---
"wow, that giant bloody looking ship looks cool, I hope I fly one one day!" Yeah, you better bet your bottom dollar I now fly a bhaalgorn, and it's one of my favourite ships to fly. :)
---
You sick fuck
---
I think is more they being lazy.... and lets face it... They see Bots and "montly sbuscriptions" that comes in... they dont look at the big Picture... ive seen this before in outher franchsies... its few the oens who manage to deal with it....
---
Someone contracted a corpse to them for 1B.
---
*Yawn*
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
We live in a post-fact world
---
I understood some of those words.
---
For example?
---
multiboxing can be done without botting too tho.
---
true but thers soem stuff you cna Pinp Point botting not Multiboxing...
---
Actually Serpentis nets me around 30 to 40 mil / relic in Fountain.
---
I tried doing exploration Delve but the isk / hour was bad.
---
In Fountain the bigger problem is actually finding sites due to only being allowed to pve in certain systems.
---
You really have no idea.

Dude :-)

Stick around in this subreddit to see the most insane, the most insanely inspired and the [downright awesome] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNUu75fH8Uc).

If you are not aware, and you don‚Äôt appear to be, EVE Online has -the most-, barring absolutely none, [freakishly talented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-m-0RlqMHM) player base of any MMO *anywhere*.
---
I could give you examples of war propaganda but, frankly, there‚Äôs so much of it that I honestly don‚Äôt know where to begin.
---
You have opened the door to the rabbit hole and you‚Äôre peering into the hole but you have no idea of how deep it goes.

If you can find it, EVE is insanely engaging, because unlike other places, [EVE is real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdfFnTt2UT0).

Not as often as I would like. I post them to corp Intel whenever I get a chance, they encouraged me to share on Reddit for this sweet sweet internet points.

Probably the one closest to Jita.

Eastern European? Last time I had this conversation no reddit it turned out that facebook is more common there.
---
love how you back peddle after talking shit and getting your facts wrong.
---
Yup Eastern European, maybe it‚Äôs connected with that
---
So you are telling me lore in Eve is more confusing than 40k's
---
LMAFO get out
---
NOT ANYMORE.. its doesn't work clearly.  THATS WHY EVERY OTHER MMO HAVE MULTIPLE INSTANCES.  BECAUSE THEY WORKED IT OUT...
---
When i started my new character (wanted to start over) i also was messaged by some gm-type person, if i needed help, how im doing in the game etc.  
---
Funny thing is, i immediately thought its a scam, and before answering i checked that character thoroughly lol.
---
HONK
---
My personal experience as a mid 20s guy in Germany is that most people (that I interact with) have pretty much ditched facebook a couple of years ago. 
---
It's been replaced by WhatsApp for messaging and Instagram to share pictures and the "microblogging" aspect.
---
And before anyone comes in saying "but those are still Facebook" I'm aware. I'm just saying nobody (again I can only talk about my "bubble") is using the site itself anymore.
---
Good bait bruh
---
Alternatively, don't give a shit about the "deep lore" of Eve and just shoot nerds.
---
It's an RP / lore thing.
---
That's good, but you have to [replace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usipm1dMX6M) the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKjl-S3Yvac) three [songs](https://vimeo.com/68255314)
---
Edit: Hell the 3rd one isn't even a song  what's up with that
---
But isn't the cake a lie?
---
Lucky you returned after 5 years to inform us all. No one else even noticed the bots in that time.
---
I don't know, never ran an incursion lol
---
i've split models up into multiple parts, and needed minimal amount of supports
---
the delay between Actions are always the same, the Rotine and bheaviour, the Schedule its always the same for this specific Nicks and its to "robotic" not Natural.... thers alot of small things that you cans ee its not HUMAN behaviour evne with a Multibox
---
aƒçi≈´ :)
---
Also, don't trust yourself. And spend less time in the Wiki, more time undocked and shooting scrubs.
---
how is this a bait?
---
same place as mega :P
---
I'm already being yelled at for cluttering the house with plastic toys lol

yep :)

I always found it strange that the space catholics had really arab-esque system names. That said,

---
*Mumbles in Gallentean*
---
I get the feeling we are talking about different things here.
---
What me and the dude I was replying to were talking about is *more drone aggro from NPCs*, not how the drones themselves choose their targets.
---
Changing how the drones auto-aggro on NPCs won't really make much of a difference to botting. They already micro-manage their target selection, and don't need to rely on that. - Mostly it would make VNI ratting more of a chore for real players. And without the advantage of the semi-automated target selection of drones, VNIs and other drone-boats would probably fall out of fashion in favor of better active ratting ships like the Rattlesnake.
---
FUCK SNUFF
---
If your account is through steam set it up so you can run it on the stand alone client. Won‚Äôt have issues anymore. Eve and steam have always had issues together. Not worth the hassle. Btw ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me what to do‚Äù when you ask for help gets you super far not only in Eve but life in general. Oh to be a teenager again.
---
This video is pure cancer for eyes
---
Try a little of everything to learn about the game to better kill people doing things in the game.
---
They don't have to ship anything from Iceland.  Iceland is probably not the smartest place to do manufacturing.  But being Icelanders, they won't understand that either....
---
No no, I‚Äôve had two pieces. It was *VERY* sweet, but it was real.
---
Are you having a seizure?
---
Lore inconsistencies... In a Fandom wiki?!? I am shocked I tell, shocked and abhorred
---
Why not both? EVE has amazing lore and shooting nerds is fun vOv
---
&gt;Corax is just a worse Talwar, no reason to ever use one.
---
There is one reason. It looks like a space submarine
---
Gotta watch out for Mark Watney, armed with a GladOS potato and potato gun :p
---
Sometimes fun &gt; efficiency.
---
I feel offended by your offensive offenses against my fellow dirty scrubs; This is prejudice against  hospital clothing.
---
I did not mean to showcase songs. It‚Äôs just a selection of the rich expression of EVE. It was never intended to be all-inclusive [ha!] or skewed to a particular point of view [I have no bone in any of EVE‚Äôs current fights].
---
I just now learn about "Mittani Went Down to Fountain‚Äù, which I find brilliant :-).
---
There are too many great things to show and share. In 11 years I have seen so much propaganda and insanely rich content. It would literally be impossible to list them all. You could arguably open a museum with all the player-generated content being the exhibits. It would be a rich universe of the wild and the wonderful.
---
Just look at [this insanely great art](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bon16z/rupture_observing_new_planet_fanart/), which is a very recent post. The creator of this art tells me they did that ‚Äòbecause they were bored‚Äô. Like, are you fucking kidding me? There are pros who can‚Äôt do that.
---
So, I provided some of the things that I saw and which captured my imagination, I certainly did not mean to be biased. It‚Äôs a smattering of the fantastic wealth of expression EVE pilots have given to their most family-friendly MMO throughout the years.
---
I applaud and salute them all. I‚Äôm not saying one is better than the other or that, by omission, I don‚Äôt like it. There‚Äôs just too much of it.
---
Look at this fucking reply LOL. Did you even try to run it without steam to see if it worked?  Tech support 101, don't be such a douche.
---
There is nothing even remotely Catholic about the Amarr. Everyone seems to forget that the Caliphate ever existed, or that the Arabs were prolific slave traders during the height of their power.
---
i PAID 2 years. Thats the difference. So yes you make a ticket for long periods of time if you accidentally forget to train while paying. Its not for "oops forgot to train for a week" kinda thing. This was slightly over 2 years.
---
Thanks for the synopsis! I love this game.
---
So I was closely involved with the E1 scams. We hosted the bonus room on Skunkworks TeamSpeak after CCP slapped E1 for using in-game channels. That decision was made to comply with GM enforcement and meant that fewer of his scams worked, as it added a layer of complexity to getting people involved. The Belligerent Undesirables community channels were the primary backend communication for coordinating activity around the scams. Some of the bigger ones were surprisingly complex. Psychotic Monk basically took E1s expert scamming and turned it into a community event. 
---
I won't claim that E1 did no wrong, but I do believe he got a bad rap for what went down. The vast majority of his work was simply convincing marks to double down on losses. The more absurd requests like singing on comms had a purpose:
---
Spent on hazard, vine and whores.
---
Shot the messenger and then you'll never need to worry about the message!
---
Trig bashing fleet best bashing fleet. But I do approve of bringing drakes
---
dude looks like pgl in 30 years.
---
Ya, the new one looks like the Battlestar Galactica with an open maw hanger in the front.
---
Show them what cluttering really means by creating a complete set of all super carriers, titans and force auxiliary?
---
No sleipnir skin even tho hurricane and hfi ?
---
Well ideal fleet comp was something like 15-20 vindicators, 10 NMs, 5 machs, 8 logi (split between basi and scimi) and a booster ship, versus a ton of Nightmares (and the other Sansha ships) with impossible loadouts
---
Take my money, seriously.
---
As a wormhole CEO I approve of this message. Most CEOs strive to create a independent, operational corporation. Even if your in an alliance, most CEOs look at this as a benchmark. In wormhole space, your on your own. It's probably the most freedom you could have in this game.
---
You can solo a hulk in a cat under the right circumstances.
---
Yeah the banhammer they dropped was excessive. Banning E1 would have ended it. Maybe the people directly involved in posting the recordings. People were banned simply for accepting assets from the scam, which has never been against the rules.
---
Only been through Thera once and was awestruck by the place. This was cool, please share more often!
---
Not true. This is just another example of the socialst gallentean media sperad false accusation and fake news!
---
SAD!
---
Keep using steam then, have a great time ;)
---
So the Chinese and Russians are the space pirates?
---
Fund it
---
America in general, really. Our politics are fucked
---
Why would I do that when I don't want to not run it through Steam? I've never had an issue with it on Steam before, ever.
---
&gt;Feel Free to use the fit at your plesure.
---
No thanks
---
AAR?
---
This epic arc gives crap rewards and seriously needs to be buffed. Why grind out reputation when the other three empires have way better and easier to earn rewards?
---
And thus came a successor to the mittani
---
then at least change the color from the kills, it is just a wild guess on my monitor which ships died and which didn't
---
white as background and a washed out grey that looks nearly white isn't the best choice, tbh.
---
Yeah, it's bullshit.
---
Player propaganda is one thing, but what you found is developer fuckup.
---
Aar ?
---
after action report
---
And racist apparently.
---
Do remember that you can repair the eve local files and clear the cache as well.
---
I'm not sure why I'm helping you though because you seem like an entitled asshole based on your other replies in this thread.
---
Well we ( muderous mindset ) have a little war with skelleton crew. But they want to kill us so bad and they could not do it themselves so they called in the entire northern coalition to kill us big battle followed  with test and their allies joining in as a 3th party. Battle lasted 2 hours.   Total of 102 ships lost. We lost 28 northern coalition 71 and test and allies only 3.
---
Cool i might put an alt in to see how it is, is there a selection process or anyone can join?
---
A small independent alliance called  Muderus Mindset had taken a little bit of sov in The Spire and decided the time was right to put down a Fortizar - they were obviously wrong and NC/PH formed hard to destroy it and start their eviction.
---
Other than the material of the hull not being able to withstand the atmosphere, I can‚Äôt imagine it would be an issue to fly an EVE ship in atmosphere.
---
They have warp capability. When you have that much energy at your disposal, you can fly in an atmosphere.
---
Cool, now you do.  Now you need to figure out what's causing it, steam or the eve install. How can you figure that out?  Launching without steam.  I'm surprised with your attitude you could figure out how to even operate your PC.
---
Yea that is completly true.
---
It's almost like you give someone bullshit, they might give you the bullshit back. Go figure!
---
IIRC according to the lore somewhere they are catholic, i remember seeing this discussion a lot. It always bugged me though, because they really do seem.. arab.
---
&gt; there hasn't been this sort of How Dare The Peasants Attack Me squealing outrage in like a decade
---
Small independent alliances taking sov in 2019. Looking at sov maps that might actually be possible. The problem is as soon as you put down anything bigger than the TCU you are a target for your neighbours.
---
Ok now you start to annoy me a tiny little bit my friend ;-)
---
First: I have been a member of condi for more than 4 years, until I left at the end of the last year due to the lack of content they provide. So please don't bother me with your standard goon trolling attempts about how you pretend to be the "bad guyz", that doesn't work with me.
---
Second: although I have to admit that the goons are probably the best organized alliance in this game, the ability to form a defense fleet isn't an ability exclusively seen within Goonswarm. 
---
In fact, every competent alliance that has a few titan pilots online during their primetime forms effective defense fleets, for example test alliance, nc., pandemic horde, init etc.... 
---
The problem with these defensive fleets in general ( and I already stated that in my previous posts ) is that due to the high amounths of anoms within a region, a whole coalition with thousands of characters is able to live within a single region under a single supercap umbrella. 
---
Yes, Goonswarm is the best example for this because Delve is a kinda "good" region for this due to it's shape and location and goons have more members squeezed in there than anybody else, but everybody! suffers through this. Ask Init about their last Hakonen "deployment", there is probably no bigger content killer than these large umbrellas.
---
Third: as long as I can remember, there has always been a really simple rule within eve. The more effort and risk you put into something, the more profit you are able to make. The best example for this is ratting with drones/fighters. You start off with the vni. Low effort and low risk make up for low ticks. Carriers are already better, and the supercarrier offers the best ticks as the most expensive ship ( and as long as you don't get crazy micromanaging all these fighters for more than 3 hours a day ;) ) 
---
Now check out the mining line: venture ( mines basically nothing ) covetor/hulk ( mine quite decent amounths under boost, but suffer from small cagoholds and are very fragile ) and then the rorqual. 
---
Needs almost no commands to work, mines insane amounths of ore, got the largest cagohold in the game, has one of the strongest active tanks in the game, has the ability to go invulnerable for 7 minutes. Oh, last but not least, even if you are a huge retard that has no friends to help him you can still save more than 70% of your rorqs value inside a mobile depot, so don't worry about dying just buy a new one. 
---
This is completely broken.
---
Fourth: at the time goons went to delve after wwb, rorquals weren't changed yet so nobody had such an absurd strong industry. They had the numbers, they had luck all the other alliances were still busy with the situation after wwb, and they were clever enough to stay defensive and build themselves up.
---
And last but not least: check out the fleet numbers in gsf fleets that aren't hyped for at least 2 weeks. 
---
You have 2500 characters online within gsf, but your fcs are unable to get more than 150 people in fleet. Not everybody wants to be some random number in such a mass of spodbrains. For example, that is the reason why snuffed leaved the imperium again. Why a lot of "old" goons recently leaved gsf. There are other play styles than blueing up with everybody and mine until the server gets shut down. It's a shame CCP decided to kill them

Finished Broker Relations V and Cybernetics IV along with a few other miscellaneous ones I had in my queue before putting the remaining subcap hulls on to train before dumping the bulk of my isk into plex. I'm taking a break for a while so I figured I'd come back to being able to fly a load of hulls I couldn't before.

Lol I love how they changed the BR https://zkillboard.com/related/30001531/201905180200/

Wait, you're not going anywhere, but you're unanchoring all your shit... don't you see the logic break in this line of argument?

E1 didn't get banned for recording and posting the sessions, as such. He got banned for what was *on* those recordings. And everyone who profited from what was on those recordings deserved what they got.
---
I fully support EVE's nefarious side, including scamming. I have no problem with ISK doubling, and I have no problem with more harmless stuff EVE players are asked to do. I was in a corp for years that required all new members to sing a song, for instance, and picked the song a couple of times.
---
What was done in the bonus room went over the line. WAY over the line in a few cases.
---
War were decl... O wait, they've evacuated.
---
That's the only place a small alliance can take sov though.
---
Kinda. As I said in previous answers, input from one person is taken seriously if that person is a recognized expert in what they're talking about. Otherwise, you either have to come in with a large group opinion (Little Things, for example), or something really data-driven that will help CCP's business.
---
Items brought up by individual CSM members that deserve to be fixed won't be, even if they're inherently obvious, unless they meet one of the two conditions above. Example: when a tackle ship enters an anom with a ratting carrier and tackles the carrier, the scram rats in the anom will often point the tackling ship (because use of e-war sets off CCP's rats). This is an inherently obvious flaw in how EVE's rats work. It actually makes a ratting carrier *safer* because the tackle rats remove their points from the ratting carrier and he can just warp off. I brought it up during CSM 8 and to my knowledge, it hasn't been fixed.

[remember that fort that was there?](https://i.imgur.com/ZZ98677.jpg)

No one can find them

wish I could :P
---
I can only relate to how bad it is. We took sov in ER one month ago and it took only a week to Unspoken to put us out and kill our fort. Its really shameful what this game has become.
---
at same scale as these battleships? yeah.. that would require a shitton of plastic lol

AAR: Murds and friends taking sov in spire. Skellies can't defend solo (BOT should really reconsider their contract). Skellies call in some homies. Murds lose fort. GFs all around. Skellies didn't like GFs...pour 16 kilotons of salt into space local. Skellies go back home and furiously masturbate while crying.

TEST didn't feed? Good job team!

Put it in the bank for the next time I want to train something off-remap. It'll probably end up getting used on command burst skills or something else cha-based.

How important is it to have alts with scanning skills? One of the things holding me back right now is the lack of ... any alts with scanning skills.
---
well they did welp an eagle and a claymore on their way home, but largely they played super risk averse.
---
You don't need an alt.
---
There‚Äôs tons of this around. I only picked the ‚Äòtop of my head‚Äô things, but there‚Äôs no end to the amount of fantastic things created by the fan base and by CCP themselves.

It‚Äôs crazy, hilarious, often fantastic stuff.

If you wanted to spend an evening marvelling at EVE turn on the electric Google machine and type in EVE Online to see how much content there is about it.

If you start Friday evening and you wanted to go on a Marathon, by Monday morning you have an idea how deep the rabbit hole is, but you have definitely not seen the end of it.

Oh ho! My honor is being besmirched! The honor of my entire alliance in fact! Gentlemen you have seen it here! the proverbial glove hath smacked The Skeleton Crew face! Muderous wants to fight The Skeleton Crew mano a mano! no outside parties! just them against us! Let us choose seconds! You will no doubt call Unspoken and Test again (or will it be Infensus?) and We will choose NC and from some of our other good friends! Now since you did the insult we get to choose the weapons time and place! Let me confer with my leadership and we will get in touch!

Constructive criticism, the announcers sound like they are talking through tin cans, you may want to dry to normalize, compress, process and compress their voice and remove some of the noise. It may be a mic issue or something, but I did find it incredibly distracting.
---
I do not know that reference.

There are tons of references that I do not get. No end to aspects of the meta game that I‚Äôm not aware of.
---
Someone had to explain to me what [this balloon](https://imgur.com/XOxzH7x) means and why [this guy](https://imgur.com/1cN1xmX) is the only one in Pandemic Legion who gets to wear a white shirt.
---
So, there‚Äôs so many subtexts to EVE, so much meta gaming, it‚Äôs impossible to get all the references.
---
BUT: I walked into the room and I saw [this magnificent scene](https://imgur.com/ebPfU0P) and it immediately put a really big smile on my face, because this is social commentary that is completely impervious to any outside understanding.
---
√Äaaaaarrrrgggghhhhhhh
---
Hmmm let me see....was Legacy trying to defend? so yeah! Cut the "3rd party spin" and just say GG!
---
It was a great tournament and I really liked the format; banning prestablished comps was a great idea.
---
Locked ship hulls instead of points asigned to them (like on the AT) was interesting and somewhat easier to theorycraft around, but I think it takes a lot out of making comps and ends up with less variety of ships and tactics shown on the matches.
---
It's notable that most teams had almost the same four comps out of five, with little variations that made all the difference.
---
Large Precursor Weapon V.  
---
And Fighters V on the last alt.

not back peddling, but if it makes you easier bending over for mittens, okay...

Their response was not "take the bus instead", more like "use the other car key".

Can you give me a couple recent examples of these high stakes fights occurring? My impression has been that, while I would also love them, they aren't really happening with things as they are now.

(I think your second paragraph is largely incorrect, but I also think it's rendered moot by the first. If the high stakes fights are actually happening, then we shouldn't make this change.)

Most characters start off with basic scanning skills. Those are enough for scanning through J space easily with a Cov Ops frigate. Really the skills help you with speed, combat scanning, and trying to scan in ships not usually used for it IE Interceptors. A good cheetah or Helios you'll have no issues.
---
I love how they take sov in the middle of a war zone and try to drop a fort like no one gonna notice and then cry that small alliances can‚Äôt do nothing. If you can‚Äôt defend it don‚Äôt drop it. K? Thanks

Yes, but you also picked the wrong place at the wrong time to try.

You are full of shit. Provi and independency doesn't fit to the same sentence. You always need someone to hold your hand in everything before you actually have balls to do anything about anything.

I always wanted to build capitals for an alliance and "fuel the engines of war" I started manufacturing subcaps and modules, while saving up the profits. This year I've taken another big step in my plan and bought a full bpo set of capitals (they are currently being researched).
---
The analysts had access to the fits as well as the comps, so they could set the stage for the upcoming match by highlighting weapons ranges, tanks, etc. 
---
I think this was a nice improvement over the AT matches I have watched, where nobody knows what's actually fit until a ship dies. The analysis were able to do more analysis here, instead of having to guess from play by play action.

It‚Äôs probably a mix up. There are a lot of lore followers in the game that don‚Äôt post on reddit that probably have better info.

Yup, TBH, It would be nice to see what the MER values our fleets as.

What happens when you light a cyno but you're not completely stopped? Does the cyno get lit in the position you were when you activated the module but the cyno ship actually moves away from the cyno till it comes tou a complete stop?
---
And I remember there was a limit on the maximum speed you could have to light a cyno, but I'm not sure if that's how it works and what the limit is.
---
Well, so alts are probably going to be essential, but the criteria I'm using is getting the solo tag on Zkill, so it's gonna be really tricky to only shoot the titan with one account.
---
We gather up on a hole and go in and out of it repeatedly until it collapses.

We then find another and repeat.

im just surprised they have access to it all, considering people are literally starving to death there.

did some research, they have one of the worse speeds in the world, most of the access in their capital of Caracas. with a population of only 2 million, the players there must be playing 24/7  for such an impact.

Ok, I read the official wiki on the origin of the Amarr Empire, and assuming it is correct that top part is wrong, and the bottom part is correct. Ammatar are Minmatar traitors who assimilated into the Amarr after they were forced to flee Minmatar space when the Republic retook their space from the Amarr

Both could be correct. The Gallente think up the name Ammatar to differentiate them from the Minmatar, and then the emperor bestows his blessing and officially renames them, using what most people by now call them.

Goons need to remind EVE that they can do more than shoot rats or mine.

Omg yes!

I don't get why the North resets Allies, rather than all blue up and fight the only other large group in the game until such a time the servers die.
---
use a proper scan site
---
Man I sound cute af
---
Everyone and their mom. Titan alts. 3 SC alts. And 14 rorquals.
---
And then to think of the fact that most of the PVP squads have already been deployed.
---
It's funny how Eve mimics the real world. We have a few super powers while the rest of the world/universe dicks around and kills eachother... followed by complaints that they only do it because the super powers exist.
---
Or to split guns and whore on KMs
---
So, like, 17 actual humans?
---
The funny bit is that supers used to be called motherships. So your first sentence had me in stitches because of the wordplay. Then I realised you didn't mean it like that considering the rest of your post. Meh.
---
the chinese had more than that
---
"Unquestioned supercapital dominance was only awesome for the game when *we* had it"
---
 \- NCPL, probably.
---
Wonder who they're trying to convince.
---
So it should have been

Everyone and their mom has titan alts. Mother alts and vni bots?
---
only 4k,  am disappointed
---
This is so wholesome!
---
Yep! Elitness on the whole line! ;-)
---
Well why don't you ask them to come help you?
---
More like nerfed HAW titans trying to be useful
---
sometimes you find things to kill in between forcing holes closed
---
King of the goons and the first bees.
---
The north would be in a hole even if Rorquals and vertical farming hadn't been a thing, it's true.
---
But because they were, there isn't even any competition possible. That's on CCP, and the north's running from the fight is a silent protest towards them.
---
so you're going to be a renter so you can lose some frigs in fw?
---
why didn't you just say that, not that anybody cares.
---
You really hate mining don't you! What is blob fleet btw?
---
7/10
---
test already gave them space to bot in
---
Themselves, I think.
---
I do believe they are going for the throat this time. One way or the other, an alliance will probably die after this.
---
I mean the big example is the HK vs Goons one the only example of any fight is over hole control once that failed well it was over, now sure this was a bit of a miracle with rolling into HK from LZRs home, but if that wasn't the case like operation rage rolling wouldn't even have happened as HK would just have to suicide scanners out and try and find a hole in, with likely everyone on the Goons side would have set up their dead clones and jumped back for the timer, and given the numbers where not there from the wormhole side to contest that it would have been over without any fights. 
---
the shadowflight evictions have less publication on it because c4 space but again the defenders committed dreads to try and get hole control day one the ended up failing to structure hole control leading to there eviction. ( high stake fight captials on grid ) 
---
The Eviction of adhoc, like the issue became they really didn't have the number but it ended in a decent fight because tdsin managed to roll in confessors and well creating a really weird typhoon vs confessor meta. 
---
Now you might say most of the time the attacker won and that's really always gonna be the case as the attacker has a massive advantage on the defender in that they set up the plan and often have intel on defender numbers.
---

---
Thanks! It was a big upside to the way the format was developed, and whilst I haven't had a chance to commentate myself, it was born from my own experience having to frantically guess if a ship might or might not have a cap booster mid fight in many an AT match.
---
Good for you. Nobody cares.
---
Why? What happened?
---
so many miners

I wish the AT was back :(
---
NC / PL are already dead for years. AFK content leechers who cant even do that anymore and have nothing usefull to contribute in the game. Goons well are Goons. Basically if you are not among the few core members and you cyrcle jerk around in their Rental or setalite corps you are basically a Weakling slave worm that dont even worth talking about. Which ever alliance dies will do a favor to the community and the game.
---
The Chinese had an open comms meeting. So everyone was free to walk in. This is a "closed" meeting.
---
You already fucked up in your first post and said Tirbute - why even try?

That's a great looking structure bashing fleet, good luck!

nah, better just feed to a coalition with 40k more dudes than you have, thats what everyone would do right?

Goons are 10x the size of NC and form about 4x as many people.

If they met the same turnout, there would be almost 12k people here.  I think it'll happen eventually.

Hint: If you want more content, giving subjective criticism isn't the way to go. All that gets you is content that you like.
---
its not "a silent protest", its the only viable strategy, its what happens every time a much larger alliance deploys to a smaller alliance.
---
It's great. Open world. Sandbox. Player created economy. It's a bit simpler than EVE, overall, but a bit more fun, in that you can see combat actually happening.
---
Yeah thats not going to happen, no one wants to camp someone for months without any good content. Most of NCPL are already used to not living in the same place for long. 
---
Goons are going to burn tribute and go home, maybe there will be a few cap fights but nothing big will come out of this war
---
Who will NC rent from when they are homeless?
---
Another ratting op?
---
lmao "it's okay when they do it"
---
You Sir, just made my day. I looked down and read straight across!!!
---
Goon linemembers are glorified renters, he's not wrong. You literally need to have mandatory recorded fleet attendance to stop people from mining all day.
---
Someone's bitter
---
what? It was the right thing to do when goons did it, its the right thing to do for panfam. Do you actually mean that you would put your 300 titans against 700? stop with the koolaid
---
clap...clap....
---
Nope, that's against the eula. (Selling/trading in game commodities for real life money)
---
It seems you care enough to post a reply :D
---
they're just more casual players i'd say, thats true for all larger alliances. 
---
NC. formed 1k dudes today, if goons had the same relative amount they would have formed 10k
---
Random corp is now a renter? Interesting
---
Thanks for the response. Is small gang viable? Even 2v2 HG's look fun to me.

i just dont like the monopoly of power of Goons, but NC itself makes that people outside Goons is happy with this. Best Goons propaganda comes from actions fo NCPL. And their own actions is what made that now they are alone to face the meatgrinder fleet of Goons.   
---
What i see in that screenshot, is justice about to be served.
---
Its u/eve_spectre, what did you expect
---
When's the last time NC. has formed a thousand dudes? Don't they usually max up at around 500 for big timers?
---
Have you interacted with the typical goon linemember before? They're not just casuals, you have to work to get them away from the spod even while they're playing.

Piracy!

But region or 2 will be burn down and rebuilding a region will take 2-3 months at least.
---
When you engage in chat with code, you have lost. Though to be fair, if you're trying to explain to people that using your player owned ship, to attack another player owned ship even if it means the guaranteed destruction of your ship, is not pvp, well, I can see why you're having difficulties. But seriously, Anyone defending code, just put them on ignore, and anyone asking about code, just inform them they're a bunch of players who are just a suicide ganking roleplay organization. It's truthful, and it allows them to fairly make up their own mind if Code is right for them.
---
Oh you sweet summer child
---
4004 system not found

I wonder what the other alliance leadership(friends and enemies) must be thinking at this point. I mean/hope, they must be/are proud of themselves for the decisions they made all these years and put themselves and their members in a spot where no-one can contest and get steamrolled by one single entity.
---
\- If you are blue you have put yourself and your members in a position of being a pet since you will never get to a level you can actually overthrow Gonns.
---
Even though you are part of their coalition as equal members we all know you are at the end pet nevertheless:)
---
\- If you are hostile that you have put yourself in a position where you cant fight your enemies.
---
No offense but if you can‚Äôt actually defend against a small alliance like unspoken while they are already busy with NC there is no real reason for you to have a fortizar in null sec, just put astras and poses and have fun skirmishing over them with little consequence.

1st move fleet, so till the end of the week i bet it will be like 1-1.2k titans deployed north
---
All-web smartbomb Hugins mostly.
---
What's a *ROBLOX*?
---
You really do though. At least one other character on the same account to park in the whole just in case.
---
I mean, yes, of course it's possible to play a single character just like everywhere else in Eve, but jspace is probably the area where you need at least one the most
---
I would be surprised if the don't at least get close to 1k
---
Honestly? I'm thinking that 4,000 ain't as much as I thought it would be. 
---
It's a big number, sure, but it's still a number that could be matched or exceeded.
---
Not far from the truth
---
when you say lowsec do you mean fw or those neutral idiots who ruin fw? I'm fw if you can't tell
---
it was indeed a mic issue - something we want to look at going forward
---
Gotta ask, where did you get the ball joint stand from and how did you attach it? Don't see it in there.
---
It's not like bringing any number of titans against 300+ will do anything anyway, they'll still clear the structure and the server will still die before any meaningful losses occur.
---
IF PanFam and NC are alone now, is because their own actions. TAPI would be their only card to make this more even but... decision were made, now karma itself is on route to the north.
---
Purely visual, like a festival luancher?

Yeah he already mentioned goon pets mate

Thanks! Rebooted my router, got a new IP, and can play again.

Correction:  Delve prepares for massive blueballs.

I don't mind being a glorified renter with this level of srp
---
Boring activity, mining, especially high sec mining. Good corp can have fun rolling all the belts in a system, or we did back in 2007-2008
---
They have been growing because nobody wants to see goons control this game
---
Depends on the size of the corp, but no, you really don't, just makes life easier
---
are there any prebuilt spreadsheets to make a start in industry easier? was thinking about a deep-dive in it since a long time...
---
oof!
---
You lost access. Which meant fire sale, mothball or try and smuggle it out.
---
Siege Green and Shoot first positioned off the Fort at around 200k. They had 3 revs and 2 apostles, and around 70 Machs with support.
---
They batphoned CVA to help as well.
---
DHSJ Fleet was at 73 when we undocked. Wrecking Crew came in Snakes, about 60 as well to help us out.
---
After a short prayer that concluded with Predator Elite smashing a baby chicken on comms. Its squeak let the dreads know to warp to a Mobile Depot that was on the enemy dreads at zero.
---
This kicked off the fight. Fort  hull timer saved

GOTG Titans will be shooting who?
---
Wonder how long until we say this about TAPI.....
---
if goons let them tag along, panfam
---
Yea, 1dq had 4k. today, add in Legacy, snuff, GoTG, init etc, you have ~5k.
---
hahahahahahhahahahahahhaha

i've split them up so i could print the small bits the easiest way and avoid supports :) e.g. https://api.arturas.space/Images/image(636937014890297126).png

Also mention to the 100 snuff who came to save DHSJ lol. GF was fun.

NCPL sealed their own fate, dont cry now.
---
Hold on, so you started playing as an alpha, and grinded(ground?) your way up to a super since then? Did you have to buy injectors?
---
3 years? Thats it?
---
I like my alts too much to do that to them.
---
They third partied, were never called. Luckily they wanted to shoot the same targets. Its a shame Siege Green had to fight equal numbers!

"In the aftermath of the Minmatar Rebellion, when the Minmatar cast out the collaborators along with the Amarr, the Nefantar were granted the region of Derelik to settle as a protectorate of the Empire..

It required titans with Miner I's to mine it.

Gotta get dat sweet time counter on mah steam statistics bruh
---
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
---
project waffles box 2.0 when?
---
I like that idea, imho another option for living in WH is C4 with C3 and C4 static. It's good place for ppl who have new players in corp and like some crabbing at mornings to fund pew pew at evenings.
---
Logistics and access to NS is possible because of that C3 static.

Love me some fun drunk ass corp roams.  
---
I donated some bhaalgorns built from 10/10 escalations bpcs i do, and we had an awesome time being at the right place at the right time to help dunk some enemy dreads, carriers and subs... it was glorious. 
---
In everyday life we help our mates out, whether mining or doing triple abyssal sites with 3 hawks...good isk.  Pve and pvp.
---
My corp got some supers donated, so we are doing some raffles. We do a bunch of corp roams through the month. Everyone gets one raffle ticket per attendance up to x tickets. End of month is the raffle. More attendences, better chance.  It helps us get our participation up in the alliance too.  Directors cant participate so i cant get my grubby hands on that shiny hel.
---
Mostly though, we are on comms shootin the shit, having fun, playing how we like to play, and we have a small family inside a much larger alliance, which is also a bigger family.  We love what we do, we love the game, our corp, our alliance, but most of all whelp a cap every now and then for the eff of it.  Drop dreads.  Definitely try to stay away from drama.  Its hard tho lol.  
---
 Bottom line? Community and family is where its at.  And its a game guys.
---
Question I forgot to ask, I've heard rumors that CCP's tools for making content and otherwise are really bad. Can you comment on that?
---
[deleted]
---
Anything you want to sell fast is going to take a price cut. If you invest the time and/or effort to sell them at best price or convert them into the most profitable item, you will always make more than people will offer for bulk purchasing.
---
Double the warp speed of everything? Now we're getting ridiculous. 
---
I'd be down for a 30-50% across the board increase in all ship's warp speed, but not warp acceleration.
---
No refunds.
---
Definitely. Lots of small gang ganking and the like happening in the black territories. Especially via Hellgates, which act as a magnet for small gang PvP (similar to lowsec sites).
---
Add colour coding to fleet watchlists. And add a 'comments' section - so not only do I have you watchlisted I know what you're in.
---
cruisers?
---
Not that many. They were more occasional buys. Perhaps less than 10 in total.
---
Was kinda hard not to tbh. Not one was committing otherwise.
---
Adding scalable damage to gate guns up to a max dps. It sucks the life out of lowesec that you can't tackle ships with frigates
---
Who?
---
It didn't take an above average IQ to realize that once the out of game/RMT'ing Casinos were gone NC/PL/PH wouldn't stand a chance against GSF. Says a lot about you if you didn't come to that conclusion.
---
Although the game is free-to-play, being self-sufficient requires a premium account for awhile. Eventually, like EVE, you can pay for premium with in-game currency.
---
Grinding to a decent combat build doesn't take long either. You likely want to grind out a build to T4, before hitting small gang PvP, but that takes about 20 hours or less, per build.
---
Don't ruin the narrative. DHSJ against the world.
---
Yes, ships are counted as Exports and Imports. I once saw a video about dissecting the MER, and the guy said  
---
'and this graph here, with the trade balance... Yeah, it has the ships and those are worth the most so it is pretty worthless to me. I mean, they are great for high level strategists in coalitions because you can just see here somebody moved a huge fleet from XXX to YYY, but I cannot do anything with it.'

The speed limit is 500m/s. Lighting the cyno stops your movement, and the cyno go up instantly. It doesn't wait for you to fully stop moving.
---
Amen
---
"luckily shooting the same target" is not third partying
---
So, you can in theory use a rapid torp phoenix to tank a C6 site, but you will have a difficult time killing the smaller rats. Nags are better solo dreads for C6s, though revs also work. You won't use XL missiles in a C6 site as the largest thing you will shoot is a BS, and XL torps won't apply to those.
---
Shock horror - a wiki has contradicting information :D
---
Also: enjoy the game :)
---
yes because my dead dread with lots of snuff dreads on shows they came to save us.
---
Also even if they did you fone half of lowsec and Frat aswell or did you forget about that?
---
If we're being honest, CCP sucks at pretty much everything

---
The only criticism I have is that in a lot of those matches the additional knowledge wasn't really used at all. Sometimes they went over the basic fits in the beginning of the match, but often it was just ignored. Would be cool if gun/tank types would be mentioned for the remaining matches at the start or something
---
Cloaks for stations would be cool, even if it was just for the smallest one.
---
I dunno mate. Was your dread alt in corp? Cause all i see is ssgrn/SF on the dead snuff dreads and DHSJ dreads that were left to get off field while your anti-cap fit fortizar didn't shoot snuff dreads.
---
Don't get me wrong, nobody cares that you batphoned to save your fortizar. But the only reason your fotizar is alive is because Snuff saved it for you. Don't want to mess with the "DHSJ fighting against the world" narrative you guys have going though.
---
So many people want to kill NCdock. Who would have guessed!
---
And there lies the difficulty. I think bombers we're done extremely well as they can't be abused (too badly) on a larger scale.
---
Or you split guns to split ammo types
---
They can be.
---
You ever see a full fleet of Goku bombers, or when large alliances form bomber fleets? They absolutely get abused.
---
what?
---
Those spod rocks won't know what hit them
---
Don't think that worked last time either.
---
A fleet with more than 3 people
---
Yes, you have it right. And the max speed is listed in show info.

As a member of the "booger eater coalition" fleet, yeah we won the objective and isk war... But we worked with pred (and snuff by extension) to do it.  In this context, who are the real fucking losers here?
---
Need more cynos to Delve, but lazy as fuck.
---
.... no
---
i like the congaline to the left
---
It would rock the boat, if you like rocking the boat.
---
force multipliers can be used by the big guys just as well as the small group
---
bombers really aren't force multipliers though. they've just very good at "shooting up" to kill stuff that's more expensive than the bomber. the triglavian gangs are the same thing. they're good at killing a capship and then buggering off without being caught.
---
eve needs more of that, but it needs to be democratized away from the shoot-and-run elitepvp ships into regular line ships. supercaps should be afraid of something besides a bigger supercap fleet.
---
You call snuff when the enemy has more caps on field than you do, with the knowledge that they're going to drop a fuckton of dreads / titans and simply kill everything.  That you died to snuff just means u were on grid when they dropped. It doesn't mean that you didn't call them.
---
Cyno inhibs should online instantly. That would be a good start.
---
For me the most enjoyable part of the day was taking the shoot first leshak fleet on a magical adventure around the grid, after that the terrible scanning interface just glitched out and pinned my cpu at 100% :(.
---
I'm really confused.
---
I think this https://br.inyour.space/?s=3068&amp;b=8613840&amp;e=90&amp;t=xLeuaDveadaqaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaababaaaaaqae is slightly more representative of the actual sides today.

No one. They'll keep ~~botting~~ ratting until a neutral shows up in their system like always.

them switching mid fight does not mean we phoned them FFS mikal stop snorting the salt

MJD dessies with bombers in large fleets are monstrously strong against fleets that can't blap them.

An excellent corp and alliance to be in and a nice write-up.

ofc it does all it means is they hate you guys a lil more than they hate us

Oh PL and their love for beating a dead horse~
---
I don't think you mean 'force multiplier'. A force multiplier can be used by a big force too. What we need is mechanics to disincentivise blobbing and allow small groups to have some success against larger ones.
---
Exactly. Some way of caps needing sub cap support. A fleet of 30 Titans alone shouldn't be viable. Losing your subcap wing should have serious ramifications a well as not having cap support should leave a subcap fleet vulnerable
---
This is worse than dinoposting.
---
not sure what your hitting at, the only ones complaining are goons because they won't get easy kills
---
Lol koolaid

what part of this was "koolaid"?

I don't know if straight up cloaking is a great idea but I do like the idea of having a module that removes them from the overview needing to be scanned down. That could add a certain amount of stealth
---
We actually moved all our supers up north to protect them for ratting.

Local is primary

Except for replicator. He abused the shit out of bombers. Loved that dude. But when isboxer went no broadcast he fell off the wagon.
---
And I wonder who the fuck thinks it's enjoyable to be in such a massive group that can't be realistically countered (on both ends of the conflict).
---
HTFU?
---
I actually don't think new things are needed. I think that there are plenty of answers in the current toolbox, but almost all of these tools are just bad. Some simple changes to a notepad document would probably do a ton to fix some of these issues.
---
-Recons as ewar platforms: fixing the slot layouts on some of these, while adding more range on ewar bonuses. For example, when was the last time anyone flew a curse for td's? Why bother flying a rook when a blackbird has better range on jams? (Rook is 51.8km+48.6 vs blackbird 84.2+79km) Recons are used atm only for lachesis points, huginn webs, and typically only by blobs. Or as cynos.
---
- ewar drones: all of them are beyond awful aside from ec- drones, which are now being nerfed, for some strange reason. CCP should remove them from the game or fix the numbers on them so that they aren't useless.
---
- pursuant to ewar drones, why do drone hulls like gilas/vexors/tristans not get their bonuses to ewar drones? For example, gilas should have ultra powerful sw-600s, ev-600s, ec-600s, tp-600s, td-600s etc. Vexors should have ultra powerful -900 variants.
---
-Pursuant to the last 2 points, why not give recons a bonus to their flavour of ewar drone? For example, give the amarr recons bonuses to using ev- and td- drones, minmatar recons bonuses to tp- and sw- drones, gallente sd- drones, caldari ec- drones.
---
- Missile td's and turret td's should probably be bundled into 1 item and have 4 scripts. ECCM for example used to be a seperate module, until CCP bundled it into a sebo and just added a script for it.
---
- Let td- drones also apply to missiles.
---
- Bubble immunity: remove it for all non t3's. This was a legitimately awful game decision to allow inties/yachts to have bubble immunity. Dictor camps in null used to be a thing that defenders had to care about. Nowadays they just jump into an intie and move somewhere else. 
---
- Finish balance hacs. Adding drones to the zealot did nothing. Most of the hacs in the game are unusable for small gang purposes.
---
ur mom loser, lol

Or the courage.

So you're the one who keeps fucking up local.
---
Ideally you want to find a corp whose goals line up with yours, this means their members interested will be pretty close to yours. So if you like exploring, join an exploration corp. If you want to kill stuff, join a PvP corp, industry is abig bucket of activities, though you'll usually find people doing all bits of it in an indy focused corp.
---
I join indy corps, I enjoy mining with others, doing corp build projects were we're collecting required mins, all building parts together and seeing the end result. We also build ships and have little PvP tournaments with each other. Sometimes an NPC dread/super will spawn and we'll go kill it together, or buy a 10/10 bm and do that together. With abysal sites, we've run a few of those together, though I'm not a huge fan of them. Maybe we'll discuss the best way to run PI chains, or ask questions about how to build x.
---
I think the communication outside the game you get in a good corp makes a big difference.
---
Honestly it just looks like a Saturday in delve so far.
---
Well let‚Äôs say 20 seconds or it‚Äôs hilariously uncounterable
---
But what do they really expect to shoot?
---
More force dividers like cyno inhibs/defensive drag bubbles would be a much more useful addition to the game. Large groups benefit the most from force multipliers and are hurt the most from force dividers.
---
Whatever makes us sleep better right?
---
La Veracruz had 400 more members than skill urself
---
Agreed, hopefully this kills the game and we can all go to something better
---
I would be mad if I was stuck in an npc-corp for 47 years as well.
---
I'm kinda sad this is happening because I had hoped NC.PL would just keep evacuating because of a few reddit posts.
---
Elites shoot some rorqs and Goons shoot some structures, what a great time to play EVE Online.
---
I suggest to change rorq to some Upwell structure so we could have a nice consistency.
---
Me
---
nailed it on the sound-effects.
---
Thank you for including the previous kills from previous days. So that we can see there isn't a big difference.
---
Yes. Eve is mainly PvE these days.
---
and no fucks were given
---
Providence, test and brave fought pl many times when they were outgunned
---
PL used to go after smaller alliances all the time, why is it bad for goons to do the same now?
---
The game isn't ending or anything, the North are just being sore losers
---
shoot first is on the same side as siege green bruh
---
Wow. It took 3 hours for the first lets hunt delve post. Kinda disappointed.
---
reported, toxic
---
CCPls 64 bit client before the war kicks off.

Close but not correct, Its called NorthernTears
---
how else do we bless the dreads?
---
Maybe but in my opinion i really loved how they use the song maybe is that the lyrics means more to me than the music itself but i really enjoy it and i think many other hispanics in eve will enjoy it too also i love the song choice and killmail of this channel along with youtuber Nolan this guy uses great songs and i like how he presents the kill. Nolan nor this guy is like my man bjornbee but i really like this shit.

You should message Sadus about renting from Goons in Period Basis.

Plenty of pve action to really enjoy. There are corporations who run PVE only content. Eve is a place where you can do whatever the frig you want.

Time for the season of "LOOK AT US KILLING RETARDS WHILE GOONS BURN OUR HOME!" posts

IKR when title is like BIG Battle and its less dudes than your average border skirmish.

That's what I was afraid of. Oh well.

Mjd dessies work well against the industrial war machines that feed large alliances as well

How many messengers does it take before CCP finally gets the message? Apparently, 7352836 aren't enough. :)

my bad, you're right.  NorthernTears (NT. for short - notice the dot) refines into Northern Sodium.  Got mixed up
---
Yeah good job you beat the game. Go ahead and try the sequel next it‚Äôs also great. Thanks for your amazing and original post on this subreddit.
---
The result is just as salty reddit so it's not a bad price to pay.

See Net Exports for Cloud Ring (and then bonus you can compare when MER May 2019 comes out and make an educated guess about the number of titans)
---
Lol, nope. It would literally make umbrella fleets useless. New changes make it so that reaction fleet needs to be brought much faster. 
---
Making it online instantly would be OP. Simple mobilize depots need time to go online. 
---
That change could make them super powerful tool for capital engagement. One side, with cyno already online could deny other side's reinforcements to joining the fight.
---
If anything, only change that could be implemented is reducing duration of cyno, but that would very heavily influence other aspects of the game.
---
It amazes me that people don't think how the changes they propose would influence other aspects of the game.
---
It feels like people are desperately trying to hype this war but nobody cares because it's so obviously lopsided.
---
I want to feel sorry for the average Goon linemember, but they LIKE that shit. Bizarre.
---
No.
---
Bots don‚Äôt have ears
---
Provi, Test and brave is 30k+ toons against the 2.5k toons in pl, their supers were not deployed. Don't tell yourself that "The big scary PL" was coming. 
---
No one is saying that goons are "bad" that hits on the "little guy", literally no one is complaining
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM
---
They can do more during important CTAs.
---
Personal experience?
---
Goons (especially the old ones) are easily the least trustworthy, followed by Sort, then Elo/BL, then Test.
---
Most honourable?.. SOLAR circa 2008 used to have my utmost respect regarding their diplomacy, followed by EE (rip, miss them), then INIT.
---
SNUFF in my personal experience (I mean, I've been in almost every "backstab" fleet of SNUFF's for the last 3 years) aren't as bad as many others (esp. goons, grrr goons) - the only difference being they don't hide behind propaganda and spins when they backstab someone.

Oh man! Operating one of these things used to be my job for a few years! The click the jog wheel makes when you hit one of those function keys was always so satisfying!
---
Deleting or delaying local would kill renters. It would also weaken krabbing in big alliances.
---
It would allow small guerilla forces to roam large alliances space and kill so many carebears that are basically just f1 monkeys in war.
---
You could seriously thin the numbers of a big alliance over a long campaign of preventing ratting.
---
Please , bring your coalition in a land of shit and flush yourself.
---
Yeah, I thought force multipliers was a term used for things such as adding logi to a fleet, or adding boosts to a fleet.

I love how those 6/8 guys have an orbit going in the lower left.
---
Someone should tell the goon propaganda guys to make one or multiple rings around a keepstar out of titans.
---
An infinite "Titancentipede" if you will.
---
We open up connections to certain parts of space, pour out, kill stuff, return, close our connection, rinse and repeat.
---
Every pve ship needs a pvp ship protecting it

And Magnus did nothing wrong

I'm kinda surprised the ratio is that high, I expected more alts than that.

haha, this is great! Keep it up!
---
Ouch, my heart. 
---
Yeah, we deff should have fought SNUFF after the fact to redeem ourselves.
---
TIL Shoot first is half of lowsec. Cool
---
Yes, because Snuff gets batphoned. :P
---
I can't believe you were in a fight with 300-400 vs 120 and you're defending the blobbers just because Snuff decided they hate them more.
---
You are asking a bunch of semi-hardcore PVP players what their opinions are on the PVE content. It's always going to be "it's the easiest most boring thing ever in the game."
---
The conga line actually got even longer before we started the move op
---
I have the same problem. Best you can do is to stretch the window to barely not cover the screen and then maximize it. Next time it will remember the stretched position which is close enough to max that it won‚Äôt fuck with your UI. You still have to maximize it each time, but your UI won‚Äôt be borked.

---
It's not up to the other alliances to police themselves. Besides who do you want to blame?
---
TEST for calling them for help, so they didn't get evicted?
---
Rest of the Imperium for supporting Goons?
---
PanFam for allowing them to rebuild in peace in Delve? Or maybe they should be blamed for not adopting Goon model of null holding? They couldn't outproduce Delve back then, now no one can. They couldn't defeat them after all, maybe they should be blamed for that?
---
They are not to blame. No EVE player is. Not even Goons' leadership.
---
If you want to find responsible for the state if the game, fly to Reykjavik. CCP creates the rules and mechanics, players just play the game. If the is no balance or safe-checking mechanics, you can only blame the game maker.
---
Pfft you sweet summer child.
---
Idk dude , you brought it up
---
Yeah, I appreciate their honest dishonesty.  :-)
---
The rest of eve did nothing to stop this military build up. Now I hope to watch everything burn.
---
That was just a suicide sacrifice to the welp gods.  That's literally all Moros are good for.
---
Huh?
---
This has happened multiple times over the past few years
---
Same.
---
Shoot first is a SGGN pet.

Even if that is not true. I can guarantee they weren't with DHSJ, as we mutually hate each other.

---
Did you have to pay to post this big fucking advertisement or was it free?
---
Idea: inhib has instant effect reducing the duration of the cyno. Increases in intensity reducing the cyno duration more and more until its final activation that suppresses you from lighting one.
---
no one wants to farm a beaten alliance. Imagine how burnt out fcs were after playing 8hours a day for weeks, its not like everyone wants to go camp without any good content for weeks after that
---
Gotta unlock when their home is burning. Just saying.
---
Could have rotated fleets in . Use strategy to consistently keep pressure up . And now that beaten alliance is going to rampage  on people. Congrats we failed.
---
It's time we all moved to Albion.

We should make an EVE alliance, and then blue donut that game into oblivion.

Do you even play Eve?

That's true. I just miss old eve when alliances got hunted to extinction.
---
Ask someone about Unclaimed. And 5nak3eye5 or whatever that trash was named.
---
I think what your describing is asymmetric warfare.  Eve has some of that.  Things like BLOPS and ECM come to mind but CCP decided to nerf ECM to the point of uselessness and didn't get around to redoing it.  As far as cloaky stuff; it's still there but the chorus of carebears even scream that it needs nerfed(usually after losing a rorq to bombers bar).
---
Upvoted for use of upvote.
---
We should go and turn another game into Eve online lol.
---
Who's spinning now? Dotlan tells me you had close to 2k members at the time. Caladrius was smaller than you (900 members) and outformed you a lot, but this is all academic now anyway.
---
Banter aside the fact is that we lost the war because all the Northern alliances involved failed to work together effectively, not because of the 'X alliance didn't pull their weight' narrative. Our backchannel communication was poor, our fleet and doctrine coordination was poor and our strategies didn't work and Goons made us pay for it at every opportunity.
---
&gt; It would literally make umbrella fleets useless
---
Good.
---
If you can form 100 titans you can form 100 subcaps and burn over instead, and be forced to actually contest in something fightable
---
Jump gates allow for super easy travel in you space with no fatigue
---
You'll probably see Delve burning.  I'm surprised it isn't already.
