Need to ask Sort wtf is sticking out of his head. Looks like a small crane.

---
---
Any hostages taken?

---
Cat ears plz.
---
A proud eve tradition
---
Beef Tenderloin, beef Ribeye, horse, and lamb :D
---
You do realize its making fun of init right?
---
What happened to the iniative bomber fleet afterward?
---
Does anyone have a good exploration roadtrip fit for a blingy Tengu that can handle itself solo in a bunch of the DED sites? I want to head out on an exploration roadtrip.
---
Should I have a fit for exploring and a fit for combat, and use a mobile depot to swap back and forth? Good fits for both would be much appreciated!
---
Remember to prefer shorter and autopilot.
---
I'm sorry to hear that friend.  If you aren't going to be playing anymore could you send your ISK to: Foxstar Damaskeenus, I could really use it to pvp, thanks.
---
Ive been playing about 7 months now, racked up about 20b, been in 4-5 corps and it just seems like the solo and small gang styles I wanted to pursue are dead. Thats what everyone in and out of game says too. I didnt want to be an F1 monkey but it seems like if I dont Im doomed to hours of roaming with no fights, being massivly outnumbered or being at a huge sp/ship/experience  disadvantage. Ive figured out how to plex my account and have plenty of isk to blow on ships but finding even semi consistent content has been a boring nightmare.
---
Gonna go easy on you this time kid. You caught me in a good mood. Next time however you won't be so lucky.
---
You have an interesting way of keeping track of time. 
---
post one more time and mittani will have to disband goonswarm out of shame
---
I never said he was botting, you are the one shittalking here. 
---
I was thinking of giving Eve a try, but I see this thing called "Burn Jita" in this sub a trending. I take it this is not the weekend to give it a whirl?
---
Imagine feeding to newbeans lmao
---
Where would the tattoo be located? Not too many options if you want to see It in your portrait. And not everyone likes tattoos ya know? I think it'd be cool to see a tally of your kills on your character window instead. 
---
resources wars imo were such a good idea but never bothered with them because the isk/h was so bad
---
Have a gold award! Nice to see I'm 74th baby. Six and One bitchzz
---
u can't ACTUALLY afk. But I just watch Netflix and dump ore every 3 cycles so I'm basically not playing the game.
---
It's sad how so many people only see the money in EVE, not the fun. 
---
Downvoted!  Also Kenny Powers is primary
---
To be fair, they pulled war from HS, they stopped awoxing, they made it almost impossible to steal everything from an alliance. Yet they still allow ganking in HS and this burn jita. They really need to follow thru and remove ganking in .6 systems on up.
---
Thats great!  I dream that this will be integrated to zkillboard
---
Wait, is aryth a cowboys fan?  This changes everything.
---
Sure, it's be amusing. But you're not really showing those gankers who's boss since Concorde is coming for them anyway. If anything this would be used more by the end of gankers than not.
---
I dunno I just think it’d be fun to have the hunters just all of a sudden have a Space 9/11 and they die
---
Horde space its pretty full off people hostile i think. I want to try in gons any idea of corp? I try in karmafleet not news stil
---
also they mentioned war declarations... so further improvements?
---
I unfriend you.
---
 well thats a little different from what your originally said, thats more not paying attention then being afk, which if im wrong please correct me means "away from keyboard" which you are clearly not doing :P  
---
I want to joins gons space. I aplied for karma
---
I indeed counted 100, but thanks for letting us all know that you are too dumb to click on "page 2". 
---
Secondly, why do you care? I was on zkill the moment the feed popped up, it was pretty funny to see never ending deaths of mining barges.
---
So I posted it. 
---
Also stop seeing just the ISK, this Game is so much more than money. 
---
Lastly: gtfo. Seriously, stop blaming me for posting things on reddit like you have any right to do so. 
---
EvE isn't pvp.
---
Lol. Yes please. 
---
Michael?
---
Lowsec frigate 1v1 leaderboard when? =D
---
&gt;All the ~~ore~~ roqs they could be ~~mining~~ losing.
---
Said it before and I’ll say it again, cosmetic explosions. I would have paid to explode in a wave of rainbows when I lost my ship
---
That tin foil hat might be a little too tight my dude
---
Missed a huge opportunity to add fedoras
---
Even inevitable death isn't bad enough to make Hek an attractive alternative.
---
Did your sarcasm detector break?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Remnants from shit warping in
---
So you are looking at them and you merely see your own reflection and you feel bad about it?
---
&gt; Lather
---
There is plenty of room for casual play, just keep in mind that Reddit will often surface the more hardcore opinions given it is some of the most engaged players.
---
Burn Jita only really appears to be affecting big freight ships and haulers. I suspect you will be fine to start this weekend as long as you don't haul a ton of valuables near Jita, and even then I bet you could be safe. I have been doing high end content around Jita all weekend in expensive ships and have been left alone (or not found :)).
---
they die anyways lol
---
I say "AFK" because I'm paying no attention to local/overview/game in general and pretty often I actually am afk, I'll just come back to my PC every few minutes while I'm doing other things, only came back to a dead cov once so far been doing it for ~2 months and made 8b so far mining with orca/cov.
---
Sounds like a market you could jump into to make you loads of isk. 
---
At the end of the day it's just a game man, if you can't  get past there's some real people behind it, then you have some internal issues you gotta address. 
---
I don't know, I found 265 mil from 3 sites in the same sansha system just a week ago
---
I want Merk to touch me in a sexual manner.
---
Exactly same here.
---
Reddit people aren't real people :colbert:
---
I have a mate who rakes in the kms on lootwhores, he got himself ganked due to pissing of goons last year 
---
I always thought people referred to afk in most "afk activities"in EVE as "not paying attention, afk just being a default term that lost its meaning.
---
For exemple "afk ratting" in a VNI is basically just hit orbit 45km and then let your drones do the work. You can alttab and basically be "afk" as in away from the game, while other more active form of ratting would need you to pay much more attention, like active tanking.
---
Same can be said about afk mining. You're more vulnerable than when you pay full attention.
---
I think a better term would be active mining vs passive mining.
---
You must be unfamiliar with a server that was called Serenity and what happened there. You are also unfamiliar with the current business model and the same exact patterns happening on TQ that happened there. Maybe you're under some weird impression that its to live off subs from playerbase at large. is this the case ?
---
too late we already have them being built...  :D 
---
They couldn’t get my Damnation today so they have to attack me on reddit. This is an outrage!
---
Literally just gave me the reason i needed to fire up another run through... That is damned funny.
---
I appreciate you being salty enough to take the time to come and give your unsolicited opinion on my patience. Thanks bud.
---
Nothing publicly available right now has any info on the recent Pathfinder malfunctions. Access to the Slack requires a manual e-mail to the developer, which I've already done and have gotten no response from.
---
But thanks for your help. Go fuck yourself.
---
...as am I. It's like sarcastic sarcasm. 
---
guess im one of the few then who still take AFK to mean literally not at the computer
---
they removed stuff like this (titan aoe on destruction) because of what it did to the servers...
---
we really don't want to return to that.
---
The assumption its sarcasm might be the first mistake here........ oh god...
---
Yay! Thank you!
---
I agree that would be cool. 
---
I would like to see a breakdown of all the innocent people not in freighters getting waxed by people "purging" under the guise of standard Burn Jita. Not that everyone shouldn't be being careful right now, just there are a few loose cannons out there. 
---
I miss read it as "hulling ore in my atron"
---
It's goons all the way down
---
I think this one is hyperbolic enough that I'm at least 85% confident that it is. u/spruillo, care to verify?
---
Or Dodi
---
As an individual who takes care of themselves and playes EvE; I demand representation that can breath quietly through their noses. 
---
&gt;AT should serve as advertisement for the game in the same way that deadman does for OSRS, even if on a much smaller scale. They could simply cut back the free visits and use video conferencing and award them some other less costly reward for being part.
---
That would be cool, not sure how to balance it against people farming elo with ganks. Being a prolific ganker doesn’t necessarily make one good at 1v1 fights. 
---
I appreciate the sentiment, thank you!
---
What so you consider a "gank" to be? How many frigates kill other frigates solo in lowsec if it isn't 2 people looking to fight each other? Filter out frigates with cynos and frigates eith fewer than 2 rigs and I bet it's 95% consentual PvP.
---
But what is Eve without smugposts?
---
sheit i dont wanna but getting a hi res copy and attempting to clean the video or some snapshots
---
I keep getting a black screen going near Jita. Which is weird and annoying. Though that is the fault of CCP
---
when someone gets DD'd, a really loud scream comes out from the ship with the guy yelling, "BOOM, HEADSHOT"
---
Burn in hek, heathen
---
I'm recently back and want to get back into exploration again. In around 2010, I had to scan an entire system to look for signatures, but now it seems like they are always displayed in the start system (but still have to be probed down).
---
If a system shows 3 unknown signatures that have to be scanned down, is there any chance of other sites existing that I need to scan the entire system for in search of them? In 'the old days', that was how we had to do things to prove they existed. ;)
---
Candidate for post of the year right here.
---
Lol
---
Woah, burn jita week???  YAY!!  TIME TO SALVAGE THE SHIT OUT OF STUFF
---
Hek actually sometimes has prices comparable to Dodixie for a lot of items. It's just that it's unreliable and out in the middle of nowhere.
---
So are we not modding things anymore? 
---
Eve is dying
---
no
---
The dude has a slack channel, try there, he generally reads and sorts stuff out. But he's a dev in real life and this is simply a hobby, so a weeks wait is not exactly dire.
---
Most of us host our own Pathfinder and have next to no issues with functionality or use.
---
However, it might not be Pathfinder that's the issue, could be an issue with EvEs ESI, which has been a pain for most out of game devs of apps this past couple of weeks. 
---
I like it but have you considered using LE and setting up Https :)? 
---
Still less losses then an average BB Fleet with Marshy as FC
---
Thousands of players watch the AT, it wasn't just for the people who directly participated.  Seriously, what value does CSM provide that could not be done via focus groups.  I read the minutes, nothing much in there of note.  
---
Important decision made by CCP are not even reviewed with the CSM, ie Alpha Clones, etc.
---
i want you to try and imagine bumping causing damage in situations where there's, oh i don't know, thousands of ships in one spot?
---
After a year's worth of the planning, we finally killed those miners. 
---
Historic. 
---
Yeah cause they are making Nuclear weapons and/or breaking numerous laws. Pretty fucking ballsy for a computer game company to unveil its fucking office plan.
---
You sure are an angry wormholer cunt. Maybe you need a hug and a break. Because obviously your mom fucked up. 
---
One bump from a ship is no issue, but repeated one's within a ______ timeframe are?
---
I don't care for it to change, but it isn't exactly rocket science to change it for bumpers without it affecting a fleet of 100 landing at 0 on a gate.
---
Yea I hope those fucking idiot "elite pvpers" try, they're gonna face the full unadulterated power of goon might! Get fucked you idiot elite pvpers!
---
well the one wayt around that would if in fleet it would cancel out the issue with bumping. if would only come into affect when bumping a non fleet target. just a idea.
---
great, more shit for the server to calculate and break itself over
---
I'm a noon alpha in Hek and I like being able to make one jump to compare market prices.
---
I got 99 problems but a WH ain't one. 
---
Get in line.

I'm still waiting for him to finish the next fucking book.

Horse was my favorite thing I ate when I was in Iceland.  Pretty delish
---
Considered, not gotten around to it yet. Should do. 
---
These are all reasonable points, it might not be a big issue. Will definitely consider looking more broadly at solo kills in the future. 
---
because it isn't an issue.
---
the people doing these kills should post a recopilation on youtube i would love to see that
---
I'm sorry to busy mining in Minecraft. Where this green guy, obviously a goon/CODE flunky, just GANKED ME AGAIN. 
---
OUTRAGEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
(For people who don't know, it's not raised for eating. So the supply is a little inconsistent. It's also a specific breed. Iceland has rules against importing any horses. So it's all the local breed.)
---
It really doesn't help when everyone knows about burn jita a week in advance. Hell even my future spy alts that are in random highsec corps got mails to avoid jita.
---
Already replaced. :)
---
I can see the spittle flying at your screen as you hurfablurf smash the keyboard to craft this shitty post
---
BUT LIKE, 10 PEOPLE ON REDDIT SAID SO
---
Did you vote?
---
accurate flair
---
there's nothing new in this thread.
---
Yea but the difference is, suddenly that guy got dozens of killmails.
---
I see you are still ignoring the facts and suggesting it requires unusual skill or complex configuration to advance your deceptive narrative.
---
For the audience that might otherwise be influenced by your narrative, however, I will again clarify that this involves about 30 seconds of reconfiguration to rebind a couple keys, and that "perfection" in the configuration is definitely not necessary.  Pretty much any fucking keys on the keyboard that you can press without repositioning your hands will work.  If you want to go the extra mile you can set it up so that the recall and next window actions are bound to keys struck with alternate hands, as this is typically fastest.
---
It requires the equivalent of approximately 30 wpm typing speed, which is on the order of what you can hunt and peck on your first encounter with a keyboard, to recall on 4 characters in 10 seconds in this manner.  Since we are not learning how to type an entire language but how to alternate between two fucking keys, it is reasonable to assume that anyone who has both fucking hands can manage to hit the equivalent of 120-150wpm typing speed after they've been directed to the keys in question on the keyboard.  In reality, since we are not typing words here but repeating the same pattern of two key strikes, the achievable equivalent wpm should be several hundreds for anyone who is not physically handicapped.
---
It does seem ironic that you couch this narrative in terms of cheating, when deceiving CCP and the uninformed player base in an attempt to have your opponents removed from the game is to my mind clearly and unambiguously cheating.  Perhaps it is you who should be banned.
---
Very impressive whats worse then structure bashing is watching a structure bash.

Honestly German comms tend to be a deterrent for me, people pronouncing neuts as "Noits" is a particular pet peeve I've never been able to shake and it has ruined more than one video for me.
---
To a carebear, every feature that results in involuntary ship loss is a bug that needs fixing.
---
No, just don't buy shit in jita. Saving a couple % isn't worth going an additional 30 jumps from Amarr.

you may as well fit a smartbomb to an orca and use it as a freighter

did you just post 30mins of an uncontested structure bash in the lowest apm ship in the game and in literally the same grid as a keepstar? am I missing something?
---
at least turn off the UI if all you want is a screensaver, jeez.
---
I did, what's your point?
---
That's _way_ less funny tbh.
---
SC might not even launch dude. Its SQ 42 in 1 1/2-2 years from now, then the PU maybe, and that is a maybe 2 years or so after SQ 42. So at best you're looking at 2023, most likely later even if it does launch, at worst, CR might call it quits after SQ 42 is done and running, wouldn't be the 1st major project / title he would quit and abandon. 
---
I have a feeling its just whatsherface that is keeping him in it and stable as long as he has lasted so far. if not for her he'd jump off long time ago.
---
Brisc is actually probably one of the more "special" individuals i have ever met, I genuinly believe that the mittani shoved his dick so far down that man's throat that he scrambled his brains
---
I wasn't able to join fleet once due to it being full, so you can estimate that there are close to Max capacity fleets going almost every gank to make the calculation more conservative. Those fits are hella cheap though, all of the losses don't even come close to the hull cost tbh.
---
would it be profitable to just insure them and undock so you dont have to wait for them to sell?
---
Agreed.

EVE is in a state of flux right now. The developers have been sacrificing EVE's integrity in order to cater to casual players. I posted about that [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/as995t/security_update_q1_2019/egth7v0/?context=1).

To answer your question, I don't think you'd have much trouble finding a corp that would tolerate players who only log in occasionally.

Mmm, that was my thought that the copy time was horrendous.
---
If you wanna go all the way, you can repeatedly shiv 'em &amp; let them develop infections. Infections let you perform an "amputate" operation for the infected limb, which gives your doctor as much XP as an organ-harvesting op without the colony-wide happiness drop. It's a great way to powerlevel your medics. Make sure to do your shivving in a room with no bed that never gets cleaned, for maximum infection chance. 
---
Hooray! Any hauler that undocks during Burn Jita is embarrassingly out of touch with his community.

Congratulations! You are doing God's work.

Would there be any way to search by Alliance? I wanna see how shit all my alliance mates are :P
---
That would be cool. I can probably just add alliance matches to the search results (and corp). 
---
rl is dead, move to hs
---
Needs the ability to sort the wins and losses column and to search by alliance/corp
---
It wouldn't work well.. but I personally would be welcoming of it and I'm pretty sure most in delve would agree that content at home would be nice instead of 20+ jumps and worm holes to have a single  "gf" and go home.

Start checking out some other Caldari ships as a lot of them are named after animals.

God, code ganks were such a joke. They'd use 4 cats to gank my ship and fail. Comeon, the goons we're better at this shit.

i'm nearly sure the other Caldari cruiser the "eagle" is just a made up name though

Why not just add ship size proportional explosive damage for all ships.  An exploding freighter should do damage to a nearby frigate...for example.

If shelby can become a mod you can too
---
This reminds me when i just joined the game other people ould tell me to run fast away from pocos or ships because the explosion would kill me
---
Most Caldari ships are named after real animals, the rest of them are named after mythological ones.
---
Have fun looking them up!
---
That would be funny, except that the gankers would use it themselves in a heartbeat.

I don’t understand the use of Nighthawks/claymores over, say Loki’s or Tengus for missiles.... can anyone help explain this?
---
Clone soldier hunting. Not completely new, but with level 3 battleship and large weapons skill, or level 4 trained Gila or any of the good faction cruisers, you can hunt and kill clone soldiers in LS. Its good income, great for standings and sec status increase.
---
My friend just started playing a few weeks ago. He needed a new ship and I told him he was in luck, there was a special event going on in Jita. HS is chicken soup for the veteran soul.
---
If you ban one it bans the other.

Just because your special candidate dudntwin doesn't mean It's "worthless", you're just mad you didn't get your way.

he can turn r/eve disc into even more of a cesspool than usual but that doesn't make him a financial overlord

Yeah that's already happened, you're talking about in the **future**, and 'most'
---
I usually just google the name, or look here http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Category:DED_Complexes / http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Category:Unrated_Complexes
---
Eve Uni has some of that info, just search EVE Online Combat Sites and it should be the first result. Tank is gonna be dependent on what the enemies are, DPS can vary widely between sites of the same level but different factions.
---
I.m a noob that usually have no clue what people are even talking about here. I've only ever visited Jita to do price comparisons out of curiosity. But from what I've seen buy prices in Hek are quiet comparable to Jita. The big difference is that when you want to sell items the immediate price options in Jita are much better. The spread between buy and sell prices are much tighter in Jita. So in Hek, if your willing to wait, you can put in a buy order at a much greater cost reduction that in Jita. In Jita your consistently out bid right up to the point of almost no real advantage.
---
I’ve used that site before, but my problem is that it doesn’t say how much damage needs to be done and absorbed to deal with the rats. Videos don’t help either as the people making them are in high end ships that steamroll the sites.
---
Å
---
Why are we burning Jita this time for?
---
febutober the eleventeenth
---
General a decently fit and decently piloted ship of the max size allowed should be fine. IE 3/10s should be able to be run in a T1 cruiser with meta modules.
---
Ok, specifically do you think I could run a Guristas watch is a Caracal with ~8000 shield but only 20 dps 
---
How the hell do you only do 20dps, what's your fit?
---
Holy lord...my heart skipped a beat just looking at that.
---
Yah, but hey. You're dead anyways. Might as well have some fun with it. Would make an amusing killmail, what with concord potentially on it.

Problem with this: 400 nerds coordinating self-destructs or mutual suicide on the jita undock.
---
Wait, nvmd, that's not a problem
---
Wait sorry nvm, my simulated fit didn’t have any ammo loaded lol, it’s actually 195 dps
---
hisec gate to stain
---
pls never add
---
Happy Birthday Fawlty7
---
Lol that makes a lot more sense, I mean sounds like you should be fine assuming you kite well. Gurista Watch is a battlecruiser size limited site with some large mobs so incoming dps could be high at times. I run the Serpentis version in an active armor VNI without issue but I think they're pretty different sites.
---
"Guys, guys ! Put jin as close the front as possible so he appears like a full size man"
---
Oh god, please, I can only contract for so much fuel.
---
I prefer Bangalore, but Pathfinder's mobility makes this pretty serious for some players.
---
I’ve heard that the Gila is a pretty strong ship for pretty much any unrated site, should I just train for that and not mess around with bottom end ships?
---
YES.
---
I prefer Bangalore, but Pathfinder's mobility via Zipline's makes this pretty crippling for some squads.
---
Up to you to be honest, I love my VNI to the point that I've started keeping deadspace modules that go with my fit and it's currently like a 400m fit cause of that.
---
what markets?
---
If you applied in game you won't get an answer. KF use website (if up since API changes f'ed up the previous website).
---
Test/Goons/relevant krab place will ask for a minimal participation to the alliance ops.
---
If you want to mine only join one of those low tier corp in BOT(Malpais)
---
Looking at Gurista Watch it's not worth the time, actually more similar to the Serpentis version that I thought, 80-120 rats in 2 pockets, only pays about 2m in bounties so you're entirely reliant on good faction/deadspace drops.
---
Happy Birthday, Fawlty7
---
Aaaand marking Jita as a no-go...
---
U must be new here
---
naw I didn't lose anything in jita, it's just a thought where it could be set up where it doesn't mess up a fleet when the anchor up. its just a idea watching all these guys lose a ship to bad old coding that everyone exploits.
---
What is a yeet?
---
Should we tell him about Rorquals?
---
What is a life?
---
Fleet warp. Fleet clusters into ball right as they land. Fleet explodes. EVE dead.
---
no.
---
I would assume both ships shields would absorb the impact enough to avoid damage while the kinetic energy of the impact itself and the bounce effect could knock a ship off tether. It really all depends on just how strong tether is as a force. I know of know stats on that.
---
There was a mission to do exactly this in the tutorial or beginner career missions so I thought it was an actual aspect of the game.
---
dont know him but o7 dude/dudess
---
Lol this comment is so random. Enjoy the gold.

We killed him towards beginning of event and he preceded to spam local with his tears the rest of the weekend of BJ5.  Here’s some excerpts.

Which I have already done, just haven't posted cause I'm busy beating fortnight on highest difficulty for the 3rd time in row. 
---
We need a losec only module for t1 haulers which does about 160k ehp within point range on destruction. 
---
Use a cooldown timer or something to limit it's use for griefing, the main idea is adding a serious element of risk to campers and gankers to consider engaging an earnest losec hauler trying to make a living. 
---
Emphasis on t1. A t2 hauler pilot who can't run around losec safely deserves the loss.

Woke up drunk, saw this post
---
so if your ship is bump free on undocks would that be so bad of thing?
---
Where on earth do you hand in Guardian's Gala stuff?
---
the bump idea would not hamper fleets since they are in a fleet, the idea is for non fleet ships. But maybe if it's a war target it will give a slight bump.
---
lol im sure you've been touch more in goons than i have ever had in this game hahaha.
---
it's just a thought. i knew the people who didnt even read it would spew BS but a feww who would post idea's...
---
No but we do touch a lot of people.  I touched a lot of keepstars up north on our last deployment 😂
---
I remember supers being so much more expensive than this.

why am I not surprised a INIT didn't even read anything, Just stick to making video's when your trying to popular as your daddy Goon....

---
That's just uncalled for.
---
the smarter people could make the effects it would cause, I was just wondering if the coding is so old and bad if it can be adjusted.
---
I suggest you post this in eve forums under linux, also i had a similar problem (Ubuntu16.04) and was fixed by removing sounds in wine. 
---
IT is no joke that we play eve without sound as is the biggest cause of failures and lag as anyone in a tidi slug fest can attest no matter the os. 
---
Quite possibly the least isk efficient pilot I’ve ever seen on zkill with at least 1 isk destroyed.
---
If that number is even close to true this game is broken.
---
Heard good things about the television show, worth a DL?
---
hunt the people doing the events
---
I'm aware about playing with no sound, I have it disabled by default. I was working and clicked that box on my rig as a troubleshooting step to help a corp mate.
---
PS no tidi in wormholes :)
---
The fun is in the planning and executing of such a thing. That and the nice drops.
---
&gt; it's just a thought.
---
no, if you'd have stopped and had a thought you wouldn't have created  this thread.
---
Don't forget that after a short while the system will appear on dotlan as having a positive npc delta so someone might come for you.
---
Watch local, watch intel channel and be ready to warp out, save ya ship even if you lose ya drones.
---
not really accurate, 15b would be around 300 hours of vni in month so i guess with botting or unless you dedicated your life to eve
---
Idk why everyone on eve can't have real life money.
---
A well there is your problem you broke a functioning thing. \*Sigh\* Did the same i think i ended up reinstalling eve... something is gets fubar when sound files need to be downloaded.  Seriously go here [https://forums.eveonline.com/c/technology-research/linux](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/technology-research/linux) and search for your problem.
---
ps: eeww a wormhole recluse :P
---
Having spent time in Branch I can confirm that many Solaris Chtonium VNI's do spend 300 hours a month ratting.
---
Agreed.  I've run every single event since Rogue Swarm and I've always found *something* that made them worth running to me.
---
This last one though, I haven't even bothered getting a single point on.

A new hiring step should be "Survive 24hrs on r/eve as the new guy." With Falcon doing an intro thread.

The savings are often worth it. And, you do realize some people live closer to Jita than they do Amarr ya? 
---
We would only gank the poor fuckers near others to create a chain reaction and to make sure they would all lose security status down to -10. you know because their aoe has harmed innocents. Please give us more ideeas.
---
PvE Rattlesnakes and PvE ships in general do not use webs / scrams, some have webs for some specific sites / rats, but rarely. So in a cruiser its very simple to just speed / transversal tank everything. If the Rattler is sentry, then just like its mothership once you are under a certain range the sentries can't hit you. If it uses heavies with a nav computer, or mediums, you may have to kill them before beginning DPS on Rattle.
---
However, this is all invalid as it requires relatively high skills and a good advanced fit. You shield ratting VNI and alpha ain't gonna cut it here, even with maxed alpha skills, unless you come across another newb that is even newer which is too rare and unreliable, + you never know due to skill injectors. And the topic of the post asked for new player activities.

Don't even get me started on some of the other shit. I better get off here, they make me sick and disgust me, along with any of the CCPsthat were too fucking retarded and actually signed off on it.
---
He did say 'a single VNI bot'.
---
What if a fraighter could toss a cargo safe in the hold that takes up 3 quarters of the hold and on death will lock the last third inside it, so big it can't be scooped, has mobile depo shields timer and a passcode, pilot loses his ship but secures his cargo at massively reduced space..
---
Option would be take tons of shit and risk it, or take far less and be safer..
---
Ps  not a fraighter pilot.

Yea, I mean, the Badger ..... thats a kinda giveaway there, but still, I had clue about the Caracal

Normally I'd say something like 'good on him for using his isk and not being afraid of dying'

The probe scanner only shows up to 32au, but most systems are way larger than that. Do I need to re-deploy the probes to cover the rest of the system?

You click on the box in the middle of the probes to move them around (make sure to have the system map open - default is F9).

If you don't, you're a well-disciplined bot.

I mean, the loot tables were reported on Sisi for weeks before the launch, so I guess you CAN give CCP credit?  By definition it was a "feature" at that point.

Yeah, because it only shows when I lose to NPC, but never when I win against NPC

I dunno... I strongly suspect that reading the Sisi reports was the responsibility of the community team, and they just never reassigned that job after the lay offs...

---
I understand how to move the box around. I'm just not sure if the area the box moves in covers the entire system or not. In other words- can you scan an entire system no matter where you launch the probes from? You don't need to gather probes, move to distant reach of system and re-launch them to make sure you've got it all covered?
---
FRT get's a lot of posts in this subreddit recently :D
---
The Heron says so... we want to know too?? NC/PL in the same shot. That would be tasty.
---
Damn I missed getting yet another Eve first, Init truely the new 'PL'
---
Seems to be. None of the 'TitaniusAnglesmith' variants on zkill seem to be hel-capable, unless he's a very efficient krab who has never killed a single ship or lost a single squadron of fighters, whereas Madzero's zkill confirms him to be able to fly a hel (granted, that was in 2017).

It's on Stan over here 
---
&gt;can you scan an entire system no matter where you launch the probes from?
---
Yes. The position of your ship has no bearing on your probes, it only affects their starting position. You can move them hundreds of AU away if you want. The 32AU range is just the scan distance from each probe - the bubbles you see on your map - again, no relation to the position of your ship (neither current, or at the point of launching the probes). 
---
Sorry I don't understand, why did you need the distraction fleet? Couldn't you have just burnt to the tower and just cyno'd out to friendly tether? Was the ruse fleet to get someone out of their Hel so you could steal it? Unless i'm wrong isn't this needlessly complicated?
---
Only if they aren't low power.
---
This was all pre-planned in advance before hand , props to the logistics guys for all their hard work.
---
Daddy, how is a goon made?
---
Just seeing this makes me miss playing eve. The salty tears from people broken up about their cargo or their ships... nostalgia... 
---
Highsec nerds should have adapted to the game like we did, now its too late look at the MER pbuh
---
he is connected to the wifi
---
Less eyes means we can snatch and leave without having to worry about "as many" baddies catching us. The ruse makes sense for all the eyes were focused on what bongalonga was doing not some little roam in renter space.
---
There's 0 need whatsoever for a distraction fleet for something like this, it's basically INIT trying to circlejerk being camped into a system into some kind of a victory for them. I'm sure there's 1-2 people in their alliance that actually believe this stuff too lol
---
And here i thought pinging your alliance to upvote reddit posts was against reddit vote brigading rules, though i don't suppose there are any mods left that actually care too much about the state of this reddit nowadays ;/

I believe

Garbage. You didn’t even spell check.

They have constructive criticism. Normally those are synonymous but I think it’s special for you

probably about as effective as concord.

I'm sorry I didn't run this great piece of journalism by our staff of editors, my mistake. 
---
Can we please just put a damage cap to your posting?
---
Halarious, this is a shit post right?
---
soooo, I'm not gonna say it's not NC. as NC/PL probably makes up the majority of WERMT renters but ehhh, where's the proof that it's not just a random renter hel?
---
[Imagine an Eve Alex Jones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntWieh7YIgY) Videos of an enraged conspiracist, ranting on about how ccp buffed rorquals at the behest of the mittani and that the AT was cancelled so that all the l44t pvp'ers would quit the game and leave the krabs in peace. Just need a decent actor with a tinfoil hat and we get EveFeed: Info Wars.

And I could die happy

Shower me in salty panda tears.

"What do I do Lord? Destroy the PvPers, Corrupt them All, Turn them into Krabs! THE CHEMICALS IN THE QUAFE ARE TURNING THE CAPSULEERS INTO CAREBEARS"
---
Bullshit, Harvey. It's a nice snag, but this "took the bait" narrative around it is just cringy.
---
"probably" making up the majority is a long distance from "being" the majority or all of them, especially random trash like that shitlord. the guy wasnt an nc alt, and deserves losing it for being an idiot leaving the stupid thing in a pos. hell i would have stolen it, had I known the pw too. 
---
So the AT attracts new people to the game, while the CSM just appears to support dumb changes to the game that drives more people away.
---
Awesome steal dude.
---
\*golf clap\* op success, time to circle jerk on reddit.

trash being trash in wermt, more at 11

who cares?

Updooted &lt;3

Nicely done! OP Success

You saying we need Gevlon Goblin back?
---
No idea, unless they were waiting for a suicide cyno? Would explain the 1/2 minute circle jerking...
---
Also apart from a PL ship in the dock, which could have been renamed??? There is no proof it has anything to do with NC or PL. Yes it's another one of the renter's crapped on but the message was sent out to be careful... Even threatened those who loose rorqual or supers etc with a fine. 
---
Real price is even cheaper

what are u trying to achieve here? besides nothing ?

[:thinking:](https://www.amazon.com/Shower-Salt-Shakers-Muscle-Single/dp/B01BTBH2HC)

The first hint that it's not an NC alt is that it's not even a WERMT corp.

Some poor renter has clearly been a little too loose with his passwords.

Someone got ganked in jita?

Holy shit, these eternity pavilion guys are awesome.
---
And your a smoothbrain
---
I’m confused. Are you saying people should never shop from Jita because once a year for a few days there’s a Burn Jita event?
---
What's the fine for this going to be? If they want a bill per lost rorq I can only imagine what free super carriers will cost.

"WE NEED MORE LOJIIIIIIIIIIIIIII"

You're welcome

I was wondering what Elo Knight had to do with Abyssal.

Gila is your friend purger rigs to start shield and ab in the mids, damage and application in the lows and hm in the highs.

Log into sisi and have a play in free ships to see what you need to survive without risking anything
---
"cant shoot in null because they are our landlords so ill shoot them when concord is on the way"
---
Surely the load on the server of having to warp in dozens of Concord officers and wiping out gankers is much worse than having to calculate explosion damage on nearby vessels. If it can calculate Concord it can calculate this, which is a simple calculation really. Ship explodes &gt; fixed amount of damage according to size/ship type &gt; applied to vessel minus resistances and divided by distance. 
---
Just looking at this makes me glad I stopped playing.

Wrecking shot

Can you provide a specific example of something the CSM pushed for that was bad for the game and caused people to leave? 
---
When you are in a Guardian’s Gala or VIP Guardian’s Gala event site, you have three options to hand your stuff :
---
- Clear the room.
---
- Get in a ship fast enough to avoid the entire room’s DPS.
---
- Get in a ship tanky enough to hold the entire room.
---
You hand in your stuff in the Fortizar on grid with you.

Looks like someone having *a blast* !

I'll shove myself out the airlock don't worry.

I'd advise you to install steam and use the steam version of eve because proton works pretty well for eve

A third for next week?

You north guys: we keep our pve chars out of alliance

Also you north guys: that hel can't possibly have been us, it was out of alliance

This is probably the saddest post I've ever seen on r/eve.

still at least a rung or two above the tapi guy who won't leave eso with his rev

You know that with INIT there ... there will be no more peaceful ratting

Are you trying to roast yourself? Wut is dis post?

the op would have been impossible without the pre-seeding of 420 freighters logged off and filled with 8,008,135 booshers, this is what it takes to solo pvp other alliances when you are the little guy

Yikes, I never said that. But I can see how you'd think that, given you're pants-on-head stupid. I love watching goons stand in the sunshine and insist it's raining. All i said was that goons are quick to deny they have anyone breaking the rules, then claim No True Scotsman whenever they're proven wrong.

nice self promoting. cool pvp kills. killboard is green AF. go apply to PL

Once it goes into a reinforced state the Charon burns 30 Caldari POWs and 100 Female Exotic Dancers a second.

Honestly I'd recommend PH for first 3 months, then move to a smaller corp (like horde vanguard or any corp in INIT or a legacy co alliance)

This is great, I'm not sure if updated since alpha skills were opened up a bit, but it covers a lot of helpful stuff and includes fitting and easy to understand fitting theory, so definitely recommend it
---
Titans already had this and it was bad enough they had to remove it.
---
The impact just gets worse the more ships it has to damage. Meaning it's even trying to do so to Concord.
---
Just look at the smart bombing Mallee fleets that with pretty small fleet to fleet fights cause a lot off tidi.

Please be patient as we have 4 more weeks of superior intellect and planning posts from the strong and independent alliance.

---
we've killed BoB years ago !
---
Sounds like PL
---
Init needed 1 year of planning and a fleet for a guy to enter a POS pw and board a ship? 
---
Congrats on the hel btw
---
There are many different types of skills in this game, being a good pilot encompasses all of them... That means you can't pre-determine a players individual skills without first fighting them and comparing them to your own... Which means upon meeting people you can either assume their skill based on your knowledge of them, or you can fight them and test your skill vs them and see who comes out ahead...
---
But lets be real here, this game has never been about skill... There are the rare occasions where it matters, but realistically you either get out-manned or out-shipped and that's the reality of it all. You don't have a way to determine the actual skill level because the game is inherently unfair. That means you generally hyper-focus and love the type of player that relates to you, thus wormholers respect and know other wormholers, and nullsecers respect and know other nullsecers. It's all based on individual interpretation.
---
Wormholer's hold grudges. Making this reddit post probably didn't de-escalate your situation any bud. 
---
As far as how a corp is, you can't generalize an entire group of people because of what one person does. That is how racism spawned and has festered in the known world. I'd suggest a different methodology when it comes to pre-judging groups of people, like their reputation as a group... or something like minded. 
---
Lol thus why wormholers like wormholes. This is what nullsec does :).
---
How bout we just leave eachothers space alone :). I'd be much happier if you never came into mine and I never came into yours!
---
Not just us. We have some people from other alliances that join us.
---
Most of us really don't care, it's just a random supercarrier. Gj and all, but hardly post worthy. 
---
Here is this year's video.

u/squizz
---
A year in the making.
---
So would an alpha clone newb be welcome? 
---
But that's exactly my point. An AoE explosion is mechanically the same as one smartbomb cycle. We have the latter, so the former should be possible too. Sure, around a Titan there are always a lot of ships so if it explodes it effects a lot of ships and can even cause a cascading effect of explosions, but those are exceptions. 
---
Video is great. Horrible music choice though. Had to turn off the video within the first 10-20 seconds because I was so sick of the repetitive blasting in my ears. 
---
They're still feeling low about losing the war last summer and take it out by downvoting Legacy posts.  Panfam post quality has always been pretty garbage outside of Horde.  Horde is so huge you end up with a few good posters just by the law of large numbers.
---
just 2 times bosoned at gates , failed of course, and only 10 titans. oh we killed another rorqual
---
And a frieghter on jita undocked would be a large chain reaction. This mechanics has a problem off being exploited. You also have to deal with a lot more in high sec as you have a lot off sec stuff to update as well as engagement times and kill rights.
---
&gt; needlessly complicated?
---
It's INIT so yeah

You should have made up some shit about NC being baited and then link a jump freighter that died in highsec.

Waiting to see if The Initiative can stand on it own. Or will it need Goons to come hold their hand.

"smaller corp" - goes from 12000 people to 2000.

yeah... really small.

Big thing here but what if those super pilots / alts  were in subcaps instead.
---
Imagine the good fights we'd have lol  
---
We formed at the last minute Sunday morning to repair a TRI medium pos coming out of reinforce in XI-VUF in Pure Blind, rushing over in AC machariels with triage support after we learned the enemy actually planned to form for it. The local coalition of Pure blind residents undocked an arty battleship fleet with capital support to kill us. After delaying the enemy a bit, we finished repping the POS to 50% and pushed our extra FAX inside the pos shields as the enemy fleet warped to their optimals over our AC machs on the POS grid. We left our active FAX in triage out of the shields and burned to the edge of their repair range to shoot the enemy fleet, however we we're trading sub-optimally so we reversed course and pulled out of range below. The enemy fleet re-warped down to us at close range to kill our cyno inhib, succeeding but leaving their dreads bubbled on their npc station undock as we killed more of their subs. Eventually their caps cleared bubbles and jumped onto our triage, killing the first active fax after neuting him out. Our own dreads were hastily logged in and counter-dropped on them, killing their caps as we mopped up the subs. All in all a great unexpected early morning fight and a nostalgic reminder about how much fun POS are to fight over! GF
---
Good point. Maybe all stations should tether to counter thar, idk. 
---
Didn't seem to bother you when KWG were sending 600b q month. Or when FRT paid you a few keepstars to not touch them for 6 months.
---
Let's be real, FRT will offer test a big sum to stop attacking after a month.

I am one of those people.  Got all my isk back when you could play eve poker.  For while I am excellent at poker, I am garbage at EVE.

You've probably tried this already, but make sure that in the winecfg options, you have whatever sound drivers you're user (pulse/alsa) selected, *not* default audio (I don't believe that's the exact option, but it's something like that). I was getting crashing, even though both should've been the same, until I tweaked that (LM 19.1)

Must be a really slow deployment

A mobile layout is on the todo list for sure.

&gt;I dont get how you can be good enough at eve to have fuck you isk like this while also being totally unable to pilot a ship at all.

Mmmm delicious salt

Who cares about burn Jita. Its like a bunch of idiots rioting. You just laugh and go to the store on monday to get the milk.

Excellent, thank you. In the current system that would be ignored, since NOC deaths don’t result in a change of elo, don’t impact the standings. I can look at ways to show these kills informationally. Thanks for the suggestion.

I've brought a brawling battleship to catch before and had dreads dropped on me by brave the second they started losing, so now I just don't bother.
---
Sure I did, took me several days to save up for my first Vexor, but you seem to be having more trouble than that. Try exploration, find a wormhole to deep empty nullsec, you'll probably make 20 mil from a relic site even if you blow up half the cans. Or just join Horde, Brave, Eve-uni, Karmafleet or something and come tag along fleets and just loot, every T2 fit player ship drops around 10-20 mil.

Stand on their own against what? Horde, NC., and PL all within their super cap umbrella? Your expectations are too high for one alliance v. an entire coalition.
---
Inits like goons - they are just f1 monkeys. Even PH are better, than them 
---
I do commend you for being minimal with the spin and pointing out the facts rather than generalizing. Ripping off POS passwords isn't anything new though. In my experience, brain amputees who do stupid things like giving out POS passwords deserve to be taught this type of lesson. 
---
Congratulations on being #21,544 to pull this off. Your ingenuity is truly inspiring. 
---
This operation seems like a workshop for the retarded with a bunch of extra steps and jobs thrown in so everyone can feel as though they "played a part"
---
"Don't fly what you can't afford to replace". 
---
This rule applies to brand new pilots as well as veterans who've played for a decade. If you can't afford to replace that Destroyer or that Titan, then you shouldn't be flying it. Any time you undock, you risk getting blown up.
---
Early on, you probably want to stick with Frigates. And you probably want to stick with L1 Security missions. That will give you income, and a cheap ship to replace if you lose it. And it will give you time to train up for better.
---
"Bigger isn't always better"
---
That's another good thing to remember. Just because you're flying a Destroyer instead of a Frigate, doesn't mean you're guaranteed to succeed. That KM you linked is covered head to toe in the most basic gear imaginable. Pull up the Ship Info for the Coercer, and look at the Mastery tab. This will tell you the support skills you should be training in order to properly operate the ship. Just being able to SIT in the ship isn't enough. You need to keep it alive too.
---
Init's deployment going well I guess.
---
Meh. Assuming cloaky camping waiting for someone retarded enough to be caught in a Rorq/Super is a step forward. But I assume it is for the Noobperium.

This is terrible advice. Single account, single toon player is not going to do anything but waste his time mining in a single barge or ratting in a single VNI in any space.
---
L4 missions in highsec, T3 and below abyss sites, and highsec DEDs make better return than afk grinding in a barge or VNI, and you dont need to dock up any time a neut enters local cause you've been conditioned to be a coward even though you're in a 700dps scram-immune cruiser.

How's a freighter supposed to yeet anywhere regardless of its akbar intentions?
---
Don't think so. Even if the BPO is being used in an industry job when the structure explodes it'll still go into safety. &lt;insert normal caveat for wormholes&gt;
---
set your dscan to 1au 360 degree if you are inside of a plex and just use your scan hotkey frequently (default v).  You should have ample time to see when someone is outside of your plex.  It takes a fair amount of time for them to land outside, hit gate, warp in, then land inside your plex.
---
Also, keep your eyes peeled on local.  If no one comes close to your plex for a few minutes, they probably aren't coming at all, so you can go a little easier on your dscan spam.  Another trick, select everyone in local, and when a new person comes in, they won't be highlighted, and its easier to spot visually than watching the local number.  Also, sometimes someone will leave as someone comes in, making it seem like local numbers haven't changed, but if you are using the highlight trick, you know for a fact a new person is in local, because he won't be highlighted.
---
i find the insults crazy. ok, there are a lot of things that ccp didnt manage the best way, but they dont deserve these personal insults. and concerning the csm: i guess there are only very few other people in the game that put as much heart and effort into it as you and the other csm members do. kinda strange that you get flamed this hard....
---
In case the other response was unclear, you will need to do multiple scans to cover all but the smallest systems, but there's no need to re-deploy probes. I'm concerned that you may have a weak understanding of probing mechanics, so it would be worth it for you to post what you are trying to accomplish.
---
Um, what is the reasoning behind the fit on the second one?  I can't seem to figure it out.
---
great little video, some top names in there and some fun fights! didn't enjoy every other of your videos, but this one was worth it
---
I didn't, shockingly enough. I joined a corp that was full of bittervets that always would just hand out isk to me and my friends and told us to git gud. It kinda reminded me of having a grandfather that loves you but is tough because he wanted you to succeed.
---
Well certainly crying on reddit will help. Dont ever dare to ask the ones that killed you tho, or even worse do any research on your own.
---
As someone who wants local removal, I support your suggestion. Plese CCP fuck around with local some more :)

Oh why stop there, let's just make all PvP opt-in and instanced.

---
You don't get to decide who's allowed to exist in your same solar system. You can either Block them, or chase them out.
---
See this person knows how to take advantage instead of whining :)
---
You're doing Combat Anomalies right? Or did you mean you're scanning down Signatures? In lowsec I'd avoid running anomalies since they're ungated and are visible to everyone. If you're running combat sites in lowsec you definitely should be doing signatures since to find you people need to scan for the site themselves and the scan probes show on dscan.

You don't need that apostrophe for gets. Apostrophes are for contractions and to show ownership.

So long as turning off your Transponder is a Concord-able offense. And since you aren't broadcasting, then you can't activate Stargates or dock at stations.
---
I was pretty risk averse at first until I gained a solid stream of isk. I started mining/manufacturing, mission running, running data core farms, even high/low PI to get my funds up. 
---
Nothing by itself was crazy isk but all combined was 200m a week or so with casual play. In about a month I was skilled up and had enough isk to burn frigates in low for PvP and joined a null sec group. 
---
Once I got my tengu and learned to explore, isk was never a problem again for PvP. Some single relic sites (sansha) can have 100m+ in one can. I’ve had 2-3 sites yield 500m+. 
---
I’ve been on break for a year so I’m not sure if that’s the case anymore regarding the relic sites. Good luck! 
---
I am not saying invite stuff, I am saying I want to filter local so it only shows people under a certain standing.
---
who needs local anyways?
---
only wish, i could ignore certain citadels in my overview...
---
TBH, it all depends on where it is, but no, not really.  In a WH, due to no asset safety, is usually a very bad idea.  Low, null and high all have asset safety so there really aren't any worries really.  The thing I have my corp members look at is safety and ease of transportation, especially in low/null.
---
Most of us fly armour faxes so he probs thought maybe he might live this time LULW.

&gt; Will I ever understand eve enough to not get frustrated?
---
There are plenty of terrible players who have no clue what there are doing. And there are vastly more who quit because they couldn't figure it out. For those who stick around, asking questions is the right way to proceed. Bad players don't do this and instead accuse their opponent of using 'hax' or something similarly stupid. When something happens that you don't understand, research it until you do understand it because there's always a good explanation. As time goes on these moments will become rarer.
---
So tried to add a bit of tank, no cyno, and with the plates/rigs slowed his ship down considerably....got it.
---
Holy shit the salt mine in this thread!! Good on you for going in blasting in a blaze of glory! Looks like it was fun. Don’t mind the rest of the crusty keyboard warriors. Apparently just avoiding Jita and not doing anything about it until the goon goes away is way more Edgy than going and having fun with it
---
Make sure their probes show up on d-scan, so you have  more notice. 
---
Hunters will also stay cloaked on sites waiting for you to show up, so keep an eye out when you get into your first container.
---
Also, hack at 3000m off of the container, so if someone shows up on grid you can cloak before they target you. You only have a few seconds to see them on your overview, so you have to be diligent if there are unknowns in local.
---
It gets easier, keep your ships and fitting cheap so it doesn’t hurt as much once you get caught. It’s a learning process like all things in eve. With enough experience and a CovOps, you’ll be untouchable. 
---
It always amuses me when folks take the bait and start arguing over how easy something was to do. 
---
Obviously, this post was meant to be amusing. It takes zero effort to steal shit from NC.
---
buy high sell low , only advice you ever need
---
At least he didn't drop corp.
---
He wants something completly different then you. Delve is crowded  and hes probably affraid that he might not see the hostile in local. So he wants to clear local of blues and see better approaching targets. NO!
---
The payout of the SOE Arc is shockingly low because the missions count as L1s, but the value of the Arc is not in the ISK payouts. If you manage to finish the Arc you'll get a bling module drop worth more than 100 million and a massive standings increase to the faction of your choice to unlock higher tier mission agents. Pretty soon you'll be looking back at this comment wondering how you ever thought 2.5 million was a lot.
---
This may be less true in lowsec, but in wormholes if you (politely!) ask the people who killed you for tips, we'll often provide good advice. Most likely you are missing several things rather than just one, so expect to still die from time to time.
---
If it dropped items worth more than is paid for the containers, it would still be an ISK sink but would give players an incentive to actually do the event though.
---
In Delve You move a Hel through a gate, no scout. Also price is like 12/13bil fitted lol
---
I agree tho, a cyno at max range and a possible fuel truck if the previous owner put no juice in. He could be getting them 100mil+ ticks in under an hour.
---
Eat fried butter and get fat. Or get arrested for stealing a knight templars sandwich
---
As a low sec pirate myself I can honestly tell you, pulsing the Dscan is a must! I can’t tell you how many times I warp into an area, and the target is 30km-50km off, and I still have time to boat up to them and scram them. 
---
And when ppl say pulse Dscan, they don’t mean every minute or so. We literally mean every couple seconds if not every second. If you’re diligent enough, you can even catch cloakers in between gate de-cloak and cloak activation. 
---
Also how your overview is setup and if it’s tied to your Dscan makes a huge difference on whether or not you’re seeing valid info. 
---
stinky pilotttt stinky pilottt where are you flyinggggg

Yep nice video. I don’t like Rock Paper Scissors aspect of abyssal so no appeal for me but some nice luck there on the wrecking shots!

Besides this being a LvL 10 Cuntish reply, there are some valid points. You should try and contact the guys who caught you and see if they’d be willing to talk to you about how you got caught or what you could do differently. You might get an equally cuntish answer, but always worth a shot.

**SHOTS FIRED**
---
&gt;Don’t:
---
&gt;• Don’t use T1 frigates for wormhole exploration. Nothing about these hulls give you any advantage in JSpace.
---
&gt;They cannot warp cloaked. They can only travel less than 100m/s while they are cloaked. They have zero combat capabilities. They have zero defensive capabilities if you choose to fit your lows with Nanos for insta-warp. If you choose to fit WarpStabs you’ll inevitable be tackled by any competent hunter with 3 points due to your lack of a quick align time.
---
This is unironically horrible advice.
---
T1 Frigates for wormhole exploration is fine. They're cheap and disposable, low SP requirement and a great way for newbros to get experience.
---
You don't need to be warping around cloaked, and why do you even need to care about them moving less than 100m/s while cloaked? 
---
&gt;Zero combat capabilities

---
&gt;They have zero defensive capabilities if you choose to fit your lows with Nanos for insta-warp.
---
Yeah, they also have zero defensive capabilities if you choose to fit your lows with Cargohold Expanders. Don't fit your ship like crap. Not to mention, most of the "defensive capabilities" comes in the form of paying attention.

amazing fights and music any chance of getting song track names?
---
thanks
---
To answer your question, yes I struggled to make ISK to start off with. 
---
The arc is ok, try and finish it - have a look at the mission on the "eve survival" site for each mission. That should give you an indication of what to expect in the mission.  A couple of those missions are tough for new (low SP/under shipped) players. Ask in local or corp chat for help.
---
After the arc, work your way up to lvl2, lvl3 and lvl4 missions (and ships).
---
Some others have mentioned joining a good corp. This is very good advice. 
---
My corp (low sec pvp corp) is slowing down so can't invite you, but there are similar corps around, that give out ships and skill books to new players. And advice which shorttens the learning curve. For newer players I would recommend a smaller corp than the large null newbie corps. 50 - 100 man corp max. Null can also be very difficult for new players (logistcs, and pushes you towards F1 monkey).

Seriously, those numbers are comparable to Burn Jita 2 in 2013. Guess word is getting around pretty fast this year.
---
If you stay aligned to a safe place to warp to, they can't catch you because as they appear you just warp. Cloaky ships might surprise you, but only bombers would really be able to lock you fast enough.

Don't forget, there are ships that don't show on DSCAN.

&gt; Who cares about burn Jita.
---
judging by most of the new posts being about burn jita, i'd say a decent proportion of the people who frequent r/eve care.
---
I noticed you were using multibuy, it can inflate prices significantly. Make sure you price check each item before buying!  Should save you a lot of trouble down the road.
---
you can just write "nullblob fleet", just as descriptive with far less words.
---
tfw you miss POSs
---
Ghostie screams "i'm not owned! I'm not owned!" as he shrinks and shrinks until he becomes a corn cob.
---
Yes - what you are experiencing is not un-normal. It took me a solid 6 months before I was comfortable throwing around T1 battlecruisers. It takes a while to find an ISK source that you can stand to do once and a while to fund playing the game. Hang in there.  
---
Also - what really helps is alliance SRP. That way once you have something purchased, you basically don't have to buy it again except maybe some of the fit. It will help you compound your ISK over time.

---
finally a bigger kill. Lets see if day 3 can beat day 2
---
You tell me its not a bug then ?
---
You have local chat in Low Sec. Use it.
---
You can set individual pilots, corps and alliances standings to you, and you can color code them or even make them blink. So make their alliance one color, their corp another, and the particular guys that keep hunting you yet another. 
---
This will make it very easy for you to spot them right away if you are in their system or they enter the one you are in.
---
Last but not least, just to be an annoying prick to them, every time they pop you in LS you can set a public kill right on them real cheap, this won't matter unless they go to different regions or some group rolls through their territory, but it can be quite annoying for them if they do. 
---
Go to a different area. If they killed you twice in same area, that means they visit it regularly, and may start considering you regular prey. If you are solo you will be kinda screwed unless you can field what is necessary to take them on and take them out. If you manage to evade them and get away they will just bring more ships, corp mate or alt the next time.
---
Don't use open anomalies. Use gated ones. They can't cloak while going through the gate and will immediately show up on your overview, keep your eyes opened.
---
Other people here already covered D-Scan but I disagree with the guy that said set it to 1 AU. I set mine to max range 14 AU and 360 degrees default, go narrow when I wanna scan a gate or a particular object or something. This lets me see combat probes, especially if they are closing in on me.
---
Don't sit by the gate where you land inside an anomaly, take a very wide arc and go opposite, 100-150km+ around all the rats / objective and fight the PvE rats from there. There are very few ships / fits they will be able to use to scram you at these distances. When they land, in order to get to you they will agro all the rats onto themselves. Depending on their ships / fits, they may even die from them or with a little help from you.
---
Use the longest range kitey ship that you can. This will often give you extra time to react and get away while you can use its range and speed to tank rats. When speed tanking in these circumstances, do not orbit, this is important, remain on a plane and just move about while remaining opposite of the entry gate with the rats between them and you.
---
Hope this helps you out a bit.

Some filthy breeders who like women. What fags.
---
Once deployed, the MTU will tractor in wrecks and cans that are within its radius and automatically loot them. Note it will only tractor things that you have permission to access. The loot is stored inside the MTU. You can access the loot by right-clicking the unit. If you scoop the MTU without looting it, the loot will be transferred into a single jetcan which you can then loot normally.

I invented the box and squared off.

The number of ships is down, too. I don't even count Orcas. Burn Jita turns to Orcas only when there's nothing better to kill, which means the total number of freighters is 128 and the total number of JFs is... 3. Compared to previous years, those counts are way way down.

You want a raitaru because it will use less fuel for the modules you'll want.

If you are just simply doing research for ME and TE on BPO's then you'll only need a Research Lab service module.

Then if you want further bonuses you can install rigs to boost the research speed but that's going to get expensive as well.

Have to be careful of this tho because if it's a scanned down site it could be prescaned already
---
I'll consider it. Impugning upon the precious little sensibilities of people, like you, is far too entertaining. 
---
The spin is real

You stop trying to get away and stay and fight and then just be come the one people wanna get away from
---
Considering how many of us are directly related to him, why not?  
---
Oh and the fact that everyone that was alive when the mongols invaded is dead.... There are people alive that lived through Nazi occupation, death camps, and maybe World War II
---
I don't get it... How can they be so stupid to still go to Jita this weekend?
---
Mittens should come in here and quote Pontius Pilate.
---
"Stick with level 1 missions"
---
Possibly the worst advice ever.  Venture mining would make more ISK.  Frigates are DIRT cheap right now.  About 250k-300k ISK.  When I was a newbie I paid over 500k for a kestrel or merlin.  That was just the hull.  No fitting.  Tech 1 frigates can easily run level 2 sites, or do exploration, or salvage after high sec battles (burn jita is going on, as well as the TEST vs PH battles in the systems around Perimeter).  All low risk activities that easily make enough to replace a cheap frigate.
---
listen in 1000 years quote hitler all you want but in 2019 its a bit too edgy to be considered a part of normal human social interaction...
---
What are you even talking about?
---
I admire that you have the sheer willpower to look at a guy who was just banned for RMTing, read a bunch of posts of people completely unsurprised that this specific guy was banned for RMTing, and then say that no one thought he was RMTing before the ban with a straight face. Truly extraordinary.
---
VNI in null is WAY better than level 4 missions.  I've done both, and the missions o my pay decent ISK when you can take on anomic agents.
---
I mean im not offended by it personally but its edgy and its obviously put there to be "hey look guys im quoting hitler in an internet space game im cool."
---
not everyone in NC has rmt alts, and not everyone in rmt is in nc, how hard is that to understand?
---
but ok, it happened to happen in "the north" so it MUST be NC :thonking intensifies:
---
True but as mentioned the gates give you time to bail if someone lands in your pocket usually.
---
has nothing to do about word, highsec playerbase is a fraction of what it used to be 
---
"oh no this quote is from a certain person so i must complain"
---
cool
---
Yeah, I love my uncledad, and?
---
No matter how evil the man, if their words are truth they must be taken as such, for one should take care not to condemn ideas for their speaker.
---
No. No it is not. The ISK + LP will net you more per hour when averaged out, especially once your standings are high enough and you can blitz them. The only upside you get from VNI krabbing is direct ISK to the wallet.
---
Only bot-aspirants anthropomorphize CONCORD NPCs. 
---
First, where's the actual guide? Second, exploration ISK/hour is dogshit. I highly doubt you are able to plex just from exploration alone.
---
Do not try to grind your rent in low sec. Do high-sec incursions instead.

They were after the kill, we'd gank something, then they would warp in their rokh and smart bomb after the fact. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75356645/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75356645/) They even managed to feed it to the people they were ganking.

Straight up join a corp.  Eve is shit if you're alone and it's shit for new players.  Join a corp, and if they don't shower you with free ships to play the game with you joined the wrong corp, join another corp.
---
My fondest memory of eve was being suckered into joining this terrible game by goons on somethingawful.  Because I was a bootfuck new player I tried to fly from highsec to SU-.  After arriving finally I bought a stack of Rifters off the open market.  A few mins later the guy I'd bought them from convo'd me, gave me my isk back, and a hangar full of rifters. 
---
Find you a corp that treats new players like that and you're golden. 
---
Lol. Even better. 
---
I'll admit i was flying around getting on some freighter mails and popping you when i could. 
---
But im not even trying to joke that i was helping:P
---
Do not get trapped into this lifestyle. There is 0 reason to grind now when alpha clones are a thing. Join a corp or NPSI roam and have fun, right now.
---
Lol it’s basically insta death. The one shitty thing about eve is it’s not nice to players that have not been playing for a long time 
---
I’ve krabbed more in the last two weeks than the previous two months.
---
Meanwhile, Vale has still been dead as a door nail for over a year so GJ there I guess. =\
---
Pretty apparent that most of the eve community could use some sun

I eagerly await the posts lamenting how poor meek mild small-gang content creators NCdot and Pandemic Horde were hugely outnumbered and it was obviously foolish to expect a fight out of them.

At least someone is watching grammar here. You should do a quick tutorial here on the correct spelling of would've vs. the retard version "would of" . That would blow the minds of at least 70% of Reddit users.

I did some exploration in Null Sec last night, got about 15 million isk from the one site I could find.  Unfortunately the way forward from where I was and my route back to high sec had camps so I had to dock up and flew back to high sec this morning.  Still haven’t tried anything with wormholes yet, maybe if I have some free time this week and get bored with missions again 
---
get in, headshot the faction spawn, bookmark the wreck and get out.
---
it's reddit did you honestly expect anything more
---
So \_that's\_ where I've been going wrong! :D
---
The very same mindless automatons who cannot be asked to cast their vote during CSM elections are also too hapless to avoid the Jita undock for 3 days out of the year. 
---
As a lol player on the side, this made me feel a little something down there.
---
There are certain dsts that can be fit nearly permatank.  If you want to cause trouble for the gankers just get in one of those and fly around jita all weekend.  Hell you can even add a civilian gun on it (one that comes on the newbie ships) to get yourself on their kill mails AFTER they aggress you.  Much better than putting explosives into the game.
---
so this is what NC. has come to, smug posting about dumpstering a stuka fleet with titans...

Tbh with how cheap supers are right now, it's not as bad as it used to be to poverty fit. Sure when you payed 30b for a nyx hull that bitch should be pimped out with every refit. But now, with nyxs going for like 12-14b, is it even with spending 10b on refits

What are they flying?

Looking at zkill, around 8

I ran L1 missions last night for Caldari. Flying a cheap Kestrel killing drones that could not even hit me. The mission itself yields very little ISK. But bookmarking the place and coming later to salvage the stuff yielded a good 3.5mil for ~1 hour. Still not a lot but it’s something doable very early in the game and with almost no risk.
---
Yes it was hard until i spread my isk making avenues.
---
As a lot of people i was in high sec.
---
This is why youre having problems making isk
---
You are so fucking retarded mate it's like Hitler is Voldemort or some shit just saying his name means you are a Hitler fanboy or something.

The fact that you petitioned ccp and wasted their time means you are a little bitch.

Granted this probably isn't considered "proof", but as the guy that personally broke into the POS (and tried to ransom it back to the poor bastard that lost it), this is the best I got. Btw, I chose not to blow up the imicus, but to rename it for our new friend.

I see people bringing up "Ohh x corp left the alliance" and "oh u fucked over that dude" literally not knowing wtf they are saying only spewing out roomers they here without the full story..... Tri will not failscade even now as we are fighting outmatched numbers we are still doing what we need to do.
---
I like to look at things from a surprising perspective, A Goonswarm perspective.... If 90% of eve can pound an alliance the size of goonswarm literally making them outnumberd worse then we are now and they are still in game. Seriously Init has fuck all to worry about.

Now get back to your mining you cheeky shit's

I'm sure there's someone out there right now theory crafting a cheaper but still effective fit to really min max.

The first time I was flying a omen that I thought had been upgraded pretty well (I dumped a lot of isk into it in the last few weeks) then I poded back to doixie (sp?) and kitted out a punisher. My problem is my account is 9 years old and I have not played for years so I think the big boys hunt me.

An hour (or day, or week, or year) is nothing to a bot.

Goons will come. They must come.

Just the soft opening. Real deployment starts next saturday. /s

Who gives a shit about somebody’s super, delvebads lose those hyperspatial overdrive ones practically every other day now.

But when the holy leetpvper guardians of their own killboard stats lose them and get all uppity and defensive, it’s kinda funny

that's how reddit and to a point eve is in tyool 2019, there's a reason more people are killing themselves

Based on the first 6 words of my comment, probably nothing.

init. learning the hard lesson about krabbing during deployments from their masters. maybe it's time to relegate real pvp activities to sig and squads lmao

I am really struggling to find good info that is up to date on the fittings and how they effect things I feel like my ships should have done better in these fights actually both fights caught me way off guard and I still managed a good amount of damage I think against them.

Never really thought about it until I read this but I have never seen anyone be accused of hacking after winning a fight the whole time I have played for the past 9 years lol.

fuck you're right. more like 30 mins in a marauder. i was drunk. still drunk.
---
If you're going to move the goalposts, do it somewhere that actually makes sense. You're not seeing expressions of surprise because you're seeing people express disgust instead.
---
&gt; He was very far from being a multi trillionaire.
---
&gt; Maybe if he hadn't sold all his isk he could have been. Anyway, good riddance.
---
Disgust.
---
&gt; I once asked Nolak how long it took someone to pay off a 30b loan when they got it for a Rorq or Carrier/Super and a ping went out, we happened to join the same op he then starts talking shit about said person who just asked for a loan with zero collateral. I was not asking for a loan merely how long it takes the average person to pay off 30 bill with low collateral and he was just too smug for my taste. You will be forever meme'd in alliance chat you corrupted fallen Bee.
---
Mockery.
---
&gt; Good on ya Goons for blacklisting. RMT is a disease.
---
&gt; and of course to CCP for continuing to fight the bot/RMT menace.
---
&gt; For what it's worth, a lot of people, me included, thought you were an OK dude.
---
&gt; If you actually were RMT-ing though, you deserve the ban. CCP doesn't generally do false positives on this shit. Although I guess given the people you used to deal with, there is a chance you were collateral damage in their investigation into men with names starting with "Az".
---
Same guy as the first one, and again, disgust.
---
&gt; No Nolak was a common face of Theta Fleet boss and I think I remember seeing him in skirmish commander chat. In my experience, he was a good guy and a loan hawk. He wasn't really a shark; he just swooped in on the opportunity to make a loan.
---
"This is a thing he did."
---
Again, I'm not seeing a lack of surprise, I'm seeing folks distaste, disgust, and mockery. Again, if you're going to move the goalposts, at least move them somewhere that is supported by reality -- the idea is that you move the goalposts to where the ball is going, not somewhere else entirely.
---
The guy has been blacklisted and is reviled in both GSF and the wider community, what more do you want? Do you want Goons to burn effigies of him?
---
ok

How did you figure out my REAL name?

That’s what happens when you deploy and krabs continue being dumb krabs. So what?

Ideally, get a buddy and find a quiet high sec system to practice hunting each other in. Learn how the hunter hunts. Cloaky ships will always be a slight problem though

Corps in Legacy with &lt;200, the entirety of FEDUP alliance is 500 last I checked (they're good guys too) so no not really, 
---
I will append this with SAVE YOUR POD. They'll try to catch your pod in case it is shiny and probably will kill you immediately and you wont get a chance to talk.
---
You can self destruct later or whatever, but warping your pod away lets you talk.
---
Whew chill bro. 
---
I have, not because I won the fight but because I caught them without them realizing.
---
Nope. 
---
When I started the game was vastly different. For PvP I was flying mostly T1 Frigates and Cruisers which were super cheap. Literally like 6-8 hours a week of ratting covered my entire week of me welping ships. Not just that, but also there was a ton more content. Cap drops on sub caps were very rare, there was a whole shitload of small and medium size corps and alliances that you could run into in many directions for many fights. And people were flying all sorts of different fits and whatnot, not be stuck to the shitty nano meta and only couple other things.
---
Today the ships / fits I used to fly back then would be grossly ineffective, I wouldn't be able to do jack shit or get away from getting dropped on in them. 
---
As for your SOE thing. Just wait a little bit, give yourself another week or two, skills do make a really big difference then go for a cruiser. Even in a cruiser, the last fight of the SOE arc can be tough for low skill character. You will need around 350+ DPS and a half decent tank, alternatively, someone can come with you to help you but I do not recommend asking random people in chat for it, you'll likely end up podded or some other shit is gonna happen to you.
---
In the meanwhile, just go do level 1 and then level 2 security missions, come back to this one when you are ready. Do not abandon or reset your current mission, epic arc missions do not expire, but if you abandon or reset it you won't be able to restart it for 3 months and you'll have to start from the very beginning.
---
For specific ships and fits, go check the official forums newbie and PvE sections, its all in there. Once you get enough ISK you might want to get into a Sunesis, then Gnosis until your skills come up. These ships have super low skill requirements and are specifically made for newbies. Last time I checked Sunesis was around 10 mil and Gnosis 27 mil. Also, Jita market will give you much better prices and vastly better selection then Dodixie. Beware of Burn Jita, although you are unlikely to be targetted, it may happen, so its up to you if you wanna go check it all out right now or wait a couple days for it to calm down.
---
It was a(n obviously sarcastic, in 2k19) comment on the state of the game, not the validity of the question or the accuracy of the advice. That this advice is thrown around because it is universally true and has no caveats or exceptions is what is unfortunate.
---
Yes indeed. It's an apt term to describe all who aspire to be like bots, whether by excessive mining, measuring success by ISK/hr, maximizing AFK time, or treating EVE like a solo theme park game, ignoring other players. For them, the need to interact with other players is a flaw in EVE, so they naturally identify more with NPCs than humans.
---
AAR: This guy was on grid while we had a few rorqs tackled. Baited a rorq to warp off to a drag bubble. This guy warped off but had t1 fighters stuck. Abandoned them, thought that picking that shit up was good with an inhib on grid. GG.
---
I'm well familiar with the term, I remember the height of CODE. shitposting. I just haven't seen it use in... 5 years or so.
---
Are we gonna get this "While X is deployed away their krabs at home eat shit so we are winning!" posts every fucking time someone's deploy?
---
Nope, there is still more profit per character by mining in these adverse conditions.
---
mittani mittani goons goons grr

Is it profitable to do it. I would join in but I don’t know if I’d make any isk

Welcome to the eve of little consequences
---
It takes 5-10 minutes to update system instead the usual couple seconds.
---
SeAT itself is pretty low key. You'll want to focus on optimizing the memory/CPU you allot for SQL and Redis based on overall usage in a trial run.
---
An a1.medium might be fine with your use case, but maybe a little slow depending on how many people use it regularly at once.
---
And 8 rorquals in a day. Usually it's like 20-30 excavators killed in a day and 1-2 rorquals. So it's around 4X the losses compared to normal.
---
nice alt account
---
Yes.
---
Maybe the price will go up again?
---
yes

---
what do you mean? there are 83 goons in that br

Just people being bad I guess, you'd be surprised at the amount of people who are never on comms and get tackled and die because they can't take the simplest of steps to get themselves saved

---
Nah, wasn't me.  I've long since given up on living in high sec, but CODE hasn't nailed me since I was a three day old newbie in a Venture.  I have seen some rather interesting shit out the window of a Skiff though.
---
I especially love the permitted bot fleet that would descend on our local ice belt.  Whenever someone would call out the bot herder in local, it was interesting how quickly the local branch of CODE would show up and raid in our backwater little system.  It's almost as if there was a connection...

---
The main reason why less JF's would be dieing is many would be using perimeter trade hubs with their tether. They undock, see shits going on and just nope right out of their and either redock or jump out to low sec and no even bother with Jita.
---
It's one of the only major changes that has imnpacted the flow of trade in High Sec (tethering and large infrastructure investment in surrounding systems) rather than anything mechanical compared to this time last year. Also market depression. Everything has gotten cheaper every year and I would hazard a guess that over the past 12-18 months that the price of stuff (the brad basket I believe it's called) has dropped down much faster than any other period in Eves history.

I could be very wrong here and I just woke up but hey it makes sense to my sleep deprived brain.

Look I can shitpost too!!! No hands
---
Can you at least put *some* effort into your garbageposting?
---
I get harder for waterworks  
---
Yes
---
You're mixing active and buffer tank. Are you trying to rat or PvP?
---
I really appreciate not having to click another couple of buttons to get back to station. Thanks!
---
jokes on you, we made 4b from you killing those renters
---
Elite

non of those are in horde

It’s related to the deployment, it’s related to the post

I dont see how this help the eve community grow. We are suppose to change and allow the game to become more enjoyable for new players yet we allow “Burn jita” to happen. I don’t see how this event is even supported. If i recall correctly, a goon member was ban for breaking rules. Goons started rebelling against CCP and started ganking in jita until said person wasn’t ban. With all the changes to allow eve to become a more enjoyable place (stopped awoxing, wardecs, ect), i fail to see how allowing this is beneficial what so ever. Seems to me it was a way to remove other bad game play yet look the other way when it comes to goons bad game play. Seems this game doesn’t treat other players equally.

Genghis Khan was unironically a good leader. He didn't have genocidal intentions, he wasn't trying to eliminate a whole race, he just wanted to conquer the world, and his methods were the violent part. The difference between Temujin and Hitler is that Hitler had intended to kill all Jews, Slavs, etc.

the goal post is on the move

Amarr Master race?

My suggestion is to do what you enjoy, you've just started and there's the entire encyclopaedia of eve to learn, take your time try everything but try to specialise early on will help you earn but it'll give you tunnel vision of the game and risks you getting bored if you've picked something you don't really enjoy. Talk to others, the in-game chat can be fun, finding others to play with is fun (it is an MMO after all) and small ships can be just as deadly as big ones if used effectively.

You will die

You will loose stuff

Stay calm the lessons learned through painful experiences will help you unleash hell on others.

TIL there’s moons worth 100+ bil.
---
\&gt; (this one was before the official start but i will count it anyway)    
---
Listen Donny this isn't 'Nam, there are rules
---
these are their pets my friends.
---
no system index bonus, etc?
---
are we supposed to be surprised you can indeed kill renters with &gt;100 bombers?
---
A dank frag is a dank frag

I to shot this dread for a very long time. I ran out of ammo twice in my talos.
---
Thanks for the assist. &lt;3

Everyone starts out frustrated.  Kudos to you for braving up enough to go to low sec this early in your career, but honestly, you'd be better served sticking to high sec until you get some of the game basics down.  
---
Try scanning down 4/10 DED sites in high sec systems and doing those.  You might get lucky and grab some extraordinary loot eventually, and meanwhile you'll be building useful knowledge in mechanics.
---
Also, high sec security missions aren't a bad way to get started.
---
Yeah unfortunately that’s how it looks like it’s gonna go
---
System index is calculated by the amount of that activity going on in a system. Of course look for something on the low end (1-2% ideally) but depending how much you're doing you might end up raising it all by yourself.
---
Another thing while I'm thinking of it is you might want to scout out your potential system first and see if 1 corp seems to dominate that system with structures already in place. If they do they might not think to kindly to your structure upping their system index. That's going to be rare in high sec but something to think about.
---
well init wants to be elite, so this reminds them that they are not
---
aka REEEEEE
---
Looks like they're averaging 1.5 chins
---
if they don't there will be  nothing left, since not that much is happening in this game anymore...
---
There's more than one moon.
---
Baited with an unfitted astrahus. 
---
can still do it by selecting everyone and watching for non-selected people to appear, having a huge screen and stretched chat, or scrolling up and down (my favorite). 
---
This would benefit both sides tbh. Hunters would see new contacts/ random neuts more easily and know when to warp to another gate/ get ready for someone to warp into the camp.
---
whos the old dude in the cheap looking suit?
---
There haven't been a reason to fight over specific space for as long as I can remember (albeit I joined in 2015, maybe it was different before that).
---
It has always just been for content AFAIK... Just do what's enjoyable...
---
Yeah, I did that last burn jita. WH action was slow, so why not pad the kb 
---
Holy shit can this garbage stop cluttering up the subreddit.
---
What is [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75377638/) fucking nyx holy shit what a poorfit..
---
man this sub has had a lot of try hard init sucks posts the last 2 days the deployment must really be rattling some cages to get a response like this.
---
I used to run it on a pretty low-end VPS without any trouble. 
---
lol and the CSM comments, probably the worst eve video ever...
---
It depends who you fly with. When I was in nullsec, about  4 or so years ago, we had a 3 month old toon join, he was able to complete those sites in a Drake comfortably.  I think it comes down to just having the proper guidance and not wasteing skillpoints
---
When you get that far in SPs you give almost 0 fucks about when next skill finishes. Back when there were no skill queue those 50 days skills were like blessing.
---
New players aren't flying around in freighters and jump freighters. If anything, this is an exciting spectacle in the main highsec trade hub.
---
Also, pls link your killmail
---
I will add to this you can still talk to them even if they pod u since u can look at the name in the killmail and start convo their.  And I am a wormhole myself and if I motice they are a newer player I will shoot them some isk to replace the lose so they can still try to play with out to much worry. And sometimes my Corp will talk and see if we want to recruit the newbro in and show him somethings.
---
I run one for a corp about the same size, just moved off a VM on a spare dedicated server I had to a VPS. Dedicated was a 2TB RAID 1 setup with 4 cores and 4GB... ran ok, but felt sluggish.
---
Moved to a 2 core/4GB with SSD... it's much more responsive now and runs well. 
---
At least you're honest about it 
---
Lol better check that BR again because most of that fleet died.
---
Today I found an astero in a shipwreck, today was a good day
---
are you just utterly fucking retarded or what
---
do you not remember that one time about six months ago that we cyno'd our titans in range of two of your keepstars and dumpstered them?

for an insult to land it actually needs to make sense

9 goon alts confirmed
---
There is more humor in the fact that NC is charging their renters for every capital ship they lose
---
I thought the hyper carrier was the new vni and hyper supers were the new rattlesnake. Am I behind the times?

KM or it didn't happen.

"Burn the production hub of noobs because we're too pathetic to pick actual fights with the other large organisations"
---
Great work guys!  You're really killing it. :)
---
Well, I looked on zkill, and had to go to page 6 before I saw a single excavator loss in Delve, and no rorquals up to page 7, when the site bugged out on me. All of those were before Theta deployed for the locust fleet, so can't be attributed to people krabbing when they shouldn't be. 
---
I'll be honest, people that are getting ganked in freighters are NOT new players. It takes a long time to get training for a freighter (long time relative to a new player anyways) and a load of up front isk that not many people have that are also new.To fly a freighter you have to have a need to fly one over iterons etc.
---
    
---
As a new player I would love to see these big death balls of ships ganking stuff, it would be something I would want to do sometime. Thus I would reach out and learn how to join a group that does it. I would possibly end up in CODE (FUCK!) or in the Imperium or in some other group or just pirates in lowsec. Regardless it would get me, as the hypothetical new player, outside of the cotton stuffed boredom of high sec and into a more enjoyable and active aspect of the game.
---
So no, I think your point is wrong. Also you closing line: NO GET FUCKED....or if you want equal opportunity in Eve...fight the powers that be for it :P Also assuming the last comment isn't just bait...Eve is a sandbox with no actual rules outside of EULA and some mechanics, you can do whatever you wantt o whoever you want. Some of the best shit that's gone down in eve is scamming, theft and in general shit that would get you perma-banned in most 'normie' games.
---
Lol hopefully it’ll go better than TESTs deployment.  Would be great to have some real content again.
---
Didn't you guys move halfway across the Galaxy because of Goons? Hmmm 
---
6D chess
---
I can hear the distant echo of “replaced already” lol
---
Makes ya think, “why rent from nc”
---
Guess you haven’t heard of skill injectors and plex.
