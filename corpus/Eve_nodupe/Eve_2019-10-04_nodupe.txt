Territorial warfare SHOULD be why we fight. Stupid station defense timers and sov access timers just ruin everything.

I've never heard of you but if you haven't reprocessed or trashed your assets this thread is just a sad cry for attention.

We have Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for that.

Sad if true

thanx i used it to start a new acct 1m skill points seem good to me.

"Looks back on some of the best fights PL has ever had" "thinks about that more than 50% of them came from structure bashing/POS bash or Sov... does not 100% understand you.
---
Is this memes?
---
Damage Caps were a mistake. 100%
---
Yea, but you're wrong 
---
At least you're consistent
---
I already told you I'm willing to let you be as wrong as you want.
---
Well, if the UK is leaving or not is yet to be decided :D
---
What a shame, there are still enough ways to create your own content, don't need to go shoot structures.
---
Erm this was a twitter post... Then some one elce posted it here....
---
Lol, you're the one who has been consistently wrong here
---
I can only sense this ending one way, so I'm going to do the only reasonable thing and let the moron in this conversation have the last word. It's all yours
---
Thank you for being the first fucking person to actually inform me
---
But why won't you accept when you're wrong? That's kind of the main problem here
---
rip busting L5's every 30 seconds with a super.
---
Yup  
---
Their focus has always been about content for their members  
---
all I heard from legacy for a week on reddit was "OmG FrT DeCed MaNgOs"   
---
Please come back with some actual evidence from independent thought that didn't get drip fed to you to show the opposite
---
Did you have anything  specific I was wrong about?
---
no
---
Man, I knew this thread would be great, I just didnt expect it to be this kind of great.  Whatever I did to you, I did it in absolute perfection.
---
My understanding was that it's pretty much a done deal at this point. The EU isn't extending the deadline any longer, and the deadline is closing.
---
[deleted]
---
I rant alot. sorry in advance.
---
The problem with rorquals isnt JUST that they mined un-fucking-believable amounts of ore faster than anything else.
---
its that they are (to the average roaming gang) UNTOUCHABLE. especially in home systems like Delve/dek/impass or anywhere within the defenders cap umbrella.
---
Many people (myself included) kept focusing too much on the speed at which they mine.. the problem is not the speed. hell some t2 miners can probably beat it in yield now post-nerf. The problem is twofold.Stupid fucking tank. massive cargospace.
---
Anyone else remember the 20-30 man barge fleets with orca's or freighters warping in to bring the ore back?you can do all of that in 1 rorq. while being near totally afk.  
---
meanwhile. protecting your 30alt mining op can be a mess. occasionally losing a few. or drones. or the last hour of your yield as some dickhead came in and popped the cans.  
---
not to mention you had to be THERE alot more in your mass barge balls. also made spotting Isboxers/botters far more visible when they all simultaneously reacted. (tho of course this was before the mass hysteria of bots)  
---
none of that happens to rorquals, with the exception of booshing excavs (which is slowly going away as people transition to t2 mining drones cause noone dares risk a single isk more than neccesary since they cant just store them ALL in a depot no more)
---
As for the ore price going up. \*Shrug\* yes, and good. prices smashed into the floor and damn near shattered any real balance the economy had left. if the prices go up. they are likely to skyrocket as speculation takes over. then balance out at some point with supply meeting demand at some level.
---
TL:DR no reason to nerf excavs. as someone who detests pve in any form. buff them. but nerf the fucking rorquals tank and cargo and dronebay into the fucking dirt. (the dronebay is stupid. makes it a better carrier or dread than most of those damn hulls! goddamn it why cant i TL:DR correctly!)
---
Those dagun evil chinese botters strike again yelp ccp

I pointed it out to my team, but not to my customers.

I'd like to fly shuttles, why is cruiser better, it's not fair

LIP and DHSJ weren't together, fyi. DHSJ saw your leshaks sitting on the anathor, and thought, "Fuck it".

Welcome to the swarm

He's famous for being a toxic jerk who routinely threw [angry hissy fits](https://soundcloud.com/nan-6/xxxgrath-ragexxx-full-version) at people and occasionally made [irl threats](http://i.imgur.com/LiDpLgI.jpg) to other people
---
TIL: EVE isn't installed on Prison Library Computers.
---
Whats da mattah? The CIA got you poooshing too many penceils?!
---
We in FE applaud rote for coming out of the closet and embracing their blobbing nature. We look forward to the Swift bulldozing of our space so we can be ~ freed from the shackles of sov ~ and the many straggler spodbrain kills we will get. This should appropriately reflect the true situation in of Vale as we are, ofc proper Pandafam pets. I am assured that our complimentary rorq alts + titans will delivered in time for our move to malpais and the sweet sweet safety of the standing fleet.  
---
  
---
Spodbless, rorqmen.
---
Take back is very strong.
---
Moved in when Goons took the north and moved out of Delve is closer to the truth.
---
I agree. My issue with the rorq is however that it kinda killed all other types of mining ships. I liked the fact of mining fleets.
---
In the long death of eve, the most confounding event will be when this idiot and his fellow delegates from the nomadic/elite pee vee pee wing of the game enthusiastically threw their weight behind the occupancy sov/bottom up income meme, such a blindingly staggeringly blatantly obvious meta play by the cfc bearing faction, it could not have been better tailored for them than if the mittani had commandeered CCP property and started coding the game himself. Some like vince of course being completely AFK didn’t have the first clue what was happening, but this one, who the hell knows what he was smoking.
---
Big fucking yikes
---
I like fleet synergy as well, it seems to me like a miner should have something to work against after a hulk though.
---
Not the real lord servant~~
---
Agreed. Reprocess all your stuff, then do shit to get you permabanned. So you can never come back. That's how real men stop playing.
---
Bye Grath. All the best dude.
---
This is the actual real Lord's Servant. ;)
---
Pls translate
---
Jokes on you this sub sank years ago
---
Do you think it will comeback stronger in the future?
---
What actually caused that hate on you, in eve?
---
It seems to me that something suddenly happened to you
---
-A- is still shit
---
Your understanding is very much flawed. Do some reading.
---
But now the subs are actually droping like a rock.
---
Also I have not said that its dying, I have said its getting less populated.
---
Sure, the game company made the first positive change for pvp in a decade and then took it away. After a constant push to make everything safe, they gave us a taste and then took it back
---
Edit: and no, shes all but dead.
---
Just say goons. Not like there is much in the imperium except goons and test if you wanna count them in.
---
I remember fighting them in Insmother in 2006... wow.
---
Though its not clr on what side of the border teh UK will be when the deadline is through, as far as I understood... But lets drop RL-politics. Its almost as depressing as EVE-politics.
---
vOv i like grath , hope he finds what he's looking for.
---
Yeh I can tell from the bad posting.
---
You know that saying that you never want to wrestle a pig because the only thing you accomplish is giving the pig a good time? 
---
Well, I want you to know that I'm the pig, that something about you has caught my fancy, and that you are providing me with no end of enjoyment at the moment
---
Personally... I feel like they scared off a bunch of their pansy Null Sec care bears when they did the Blackout. And they haven't seen the numbers go back up since they called it off.
---
So now they're trying to boost their numbers again by offering the Skill Spree again so soon after the last one. And they'll probably keep it going, and / or do more desperate marketing maneuvers, until they appease the crybabies.
---
Just a one who can press F1
---
i give it a week before tapi blues them and gives them unused space
---
What was the thing that broke you? What was the final straw?
---
If it truly is an old POS, I'm pretty sure that only the Corp can maintain it?
---
So I got really drunk with you at EVE Vegas 2016, we played some cards, and I now know your (first) name, which was an interesting convo.
---
Going to be a rough time ahead if CCP does not fix their shit.
---
It was an early AT ship I believe.
---
Maybe even from the pre-AT tournements.

---
I think it was tuz that ran the numbers for week to week Max and it has risen like 3k in the two weeks since blackout ended. A recovery of about 30% of what it fell during blackout. Not sure how well day to day has recovered.
---
When CCP first tried to implement SKINs they allowed you to buy ship BPCs then build a ship with a fancy paint job. So the PPC was a Comet with a skin that was built from a BPC you could purchase. Then CCP said "Turns our you all will pay extra for paint on yours ships. So we made this SKINs system."
---
It’s funny that this guy doesn’t realize every country monitors everything here on the tubes. 
---
You poor little snowflake. God bless you.
---
Absolute prawns are dying in marauders. You can solo them in a gila pretty easily, and ive seen praxis do them easily as well.
---
Probably...China is known for doing it though.
---
you weren't set up. this isnt the fucking mob, you were retarded!
---
There are no pvp corp left in 0.0. Its just afk rorqs, bots and blobs
---
/u/stainguy \- this is now technically in the realm of possibility.
---
This is a good post
---
I'm sure he realizes that. Surveillance is one thing, regularly gulaging people over criticism of their government is another.
---
To be fair, dictators are as old as man-kind. Science is a relatively new concept that we are still struggling to accept as a society.
---
please stop posting.
---
Pity for the purchasing scheme
---
I'm sorry that you don't like my posting. All I can say is I'm just as entitled to respond to people's idiotic comments as they are to making the comments themselves
---
Sorry that that makes you upset v0v
---
This is too expensive &amp; not enough range (u need 45kms to kill web towers in 5/10s in blood sites the harbinger BS neut out to 30 kms iirc) maybe arty can work until u get hams. Also its going to take forever to clear sites with an AB &amp; autocannons.
---
What's the glassening?

They should never have kicked out Wallymarts.  I could only go downhill from there.

This is rich.

FTFY
---
Yeah it is a bitch it isn't on steam and that the EOD edition is a pretty good quality of life time saver for the extra stash space but is like an extra $60. But I use the standard myself.
---
Lol.
---
he sounds like he needs a break
---
Except you can buy the police comet skin with concord LP just like the bpc before that.
---
We here in Theran Alliance have an absolute problem with this!  As the mostly independent FE alliance, (Most independent bat phoning alliance in the game ).  Already gives us a hard time let alone the strength of inspermium!
---
No
---
No they’re Chinese
---
Thsts what ive done for years and never been decloaked. Warp to 70 at any celestial/anomaly, double click at a 30-70 degree angle up or down away from any colliders, perfectly safe for however long you want.
---
If I recall Blood rats ewars are mainly Neut and TD. I would use armor missile Loki subsystem and max out em/therm resist above 90%. Easily done in T3 ship. Use the subs that give bonus to cap to deal with neuts.
---
I hope it stays for a long time. I know I will log in daily to do it. So +5 to the daily count from me.
---
Didn't sven play within goons long ago tho? This was a long time coming play tbh. Rote was doomed as a small gang group
---
I was one of those. 
---
Although it makes sense they would join House Goondor, when snuff is setting up shop around the corner. 
---
Can't beat'em , join'em?
---
planetside 1 tho... I miss that game with a passion
---
Reason- if you gave me the stuff I wouldn't buy a plex and give CCP more money...
---
Out of the door, line on the left, One cross each.
---
X for POS destruction
---
So much this.
---
How can you say you quit EVE if you dont personally de-value everything you have achieved in it. I'll do the deed if you are too weak for it, transfer it all to a throwaway toon, and biomass it with everything.
---
Ok pig
---
Also pigs become bacon. At least theres hope everybody wont hate you in your next incarnation
---
Seen it looks inflated at best. Dosent taking into account sov costs, fuel or anything like that. Still an interesting video tho.
---
Imperium membership includes the willingness to deny obviously reality in favor of a better narrative spin.
---
Next month's killing spreeeeeeeee:  EVE Online becomes Sword Art Online.  You can't log out unless you beat the game.
---
I personally just blitz the lowsec ones with a super and leave the gated sites for people who have more patience
---
As someone that farms my own 6/10s and 10/10s, thank you CCP!  LOL in before all the "Need help. Is this Loki fit good enough to run DEDs?" posts.
---
Nobody hates me
---
If you had the balls to be as big a jerk in your real life interactions as you act online, you would be a social outcast or worse. Now that's a fact
---
Naw they talked about skill spree at the summit so I assume CCPs just figures it was something easy to turn on to make us happy.  Altho the timing and permeance of it could absolutely be questioned. 
---
Blackout was awesome :P
---
Now write it a hundred times...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVrEwCa8nSA

Your mom says I'm special too...
---
Yea, b-b-but... no one would dare sell isk for REAL WORLD money!
---
You mean like F1 pushers in karmafleet?
---
Thanks for this. Was wondering how the duck all those dreads died
---
in fairness, he just tweeted about it, people tweet about regular daily stuff all the time. Someone else made this thread.
---
What about the Party of Chinese Communists?
---
That just recreates an environment where the current rorq miners have gotten there cost out already and are profiting while everyone else has a shit time catching up.
---
The issue with that balance is that rorqs right now can still sit there for 6 minutes regardless of what's shooting them and the realities of eve right now tell us that everyone down south won't get out escalated at home.
---
New pay to win model. All accounts are free but to log out you need to pay a monthly fee
---
When was the last “real” war?
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
I was a big fan of Blackout too. It very quickly illustrated which Bots were incapable of defending themselves w/o Local telling them the millisecond they needed to start warping to safety. And it illustrated just how many Null Sec ~~badasses~~ crybabies couldn't handle living in the dark and lawless fringes of space w/o a safety blanket to keep them safe from any cloaky Boogeyman lurking in the shadows.
---
nope, this is hilmar's push to get himself a nice max sale bonus check, the 1 year period ends in october so he wants to boost numbers as much as possible before the end date of the bonus window.
---
I literally act just like I act here, feel free to ask anybody, plenty of people know me and have met me, they just think it's fun when I bat one of you around like a ball of string. 
---
Turns out I'm more liked live in person like this.
---
Nice
---
Hey if it eventually gets us "Old School Eve" I'd be willing to give it a shot.
---
If their "daily logins" stats recorded how many people stayed logged in for more than ~10 minutes, their numbers would look a hell of a lot worse. Logging in long enough to claim a prize or shoot the first belt rat you see, doesn't really count as "player base" to me. =)
---
Also this is fake. Has to be.
---
What’s CCP mean over there in Hong Kong?
---
?
---
You're right.  PL tells everyone how awesome they are.  But on the inside their all just a bunch of scared little girls, afraid to take risks, and progenitors of stagnant n+1 gameplay.
---
White man cant play eve?
---
Yellow man play EVE
---
&gt;*Reeeeee*
---
Yellow white black purple....you’re all equally worthless
---
Dad is that you?
---
It’s me son...your mom left me today. I told her you should have been a blowjob
---
Thanks Dad, I’m glad you’re always here for me
---
I’m gonna be gone for a while. Tell your sister, she started as a blow job, but mom couldn’t stop with the teeth.
---
There’s something you should know about me and sister... I’ll let you know in about 9 months
---
I met your mom at the family reunion
---
It doesn't count to me either but given how obsessed hilmeth is with boosting that number since the sale date it seems a pretty good bet that is one of the metrics involved in the sale bonus.
---
Good to see it runs in the family
---
It was running down her leg, didn’t think you were in there

Big talk from a degenerate with a name like that.

Oh sorry. Thought you were commenting on the video and not on a player saying they were enjoying the game. My bad.

Because krabs want to be safe and there are more krabs then pvp focused people.
---
I mean, you're not wrong but it's worth mentioning that 90% of the "names" in PL quit after WWB, presumably to "go out on top". I can't blame them really. It's why I take no pleasure in seeing them eat shit now after enduring their shit in BRAVE back in 2013-2015. It's basically a completely different Corp.
---
I wonder what he's going to be raging about next.
---
Thank you for the nice comment.
---
Thank you for the nice comment, too.
---
Fees bad, I lost a dog, he was so great, the next month I was offered a pedigree year old dog because a friend of mine was overwhelmed getting two dogs at once, professionally trained and all vax/records/chip registration.
---
Still felt bad, like I was replacing him, I was honestly still grieving, but the new pup is great, she did fill the hole and is a great family dog.
---
Point is, if Eve fails, a game of the same scale isn’t going to fall in our lap, and until Eve has a real competitor, or Eve’s owners go full jump the boat cash grab, I don’t set it failing.
---
that's one of them, yes
---
They’ll just give us Jove wormhole generators.
---
Battleship warp speed and general speed needs to be reassessed.  
---
Battleships should be the fastest subcaps other than frigates / inties.  They should just take a while to get there.  
---
Application needs to be addressed or there needs to be a penetration mechanic for small guns hitting large targets that replicates the tracking of big guns against small fast targets.
---
Until then battleships (with few exceptions) are largely pointless, about as good as hacs but slower and with huge sig
---
1/10 of 6k is 600, yes. I thought the new "flex" structures were coded as "small" upwell structures, but I haven't yet built or shot one and I'm not sure how they work.
---
\+1
---
Yeah some of them give really outdated advice though.
---
Rote Kapelle is a solid corporation.
---
 [u/Chinese-RMT](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chinese-RMT/)
---
Give nothing away. Log in, take a shot for every ship you send to the Trash. Make sure to have a loooong convo with Jeff (recording/streaming) while doing this.  
---
Instead of giving away things, think of it as... giving something back, mostly in the form of future memes for /r/eve to shitpost about for a week before moving onto something new... such is tradition.
---
Is a PL shitfit really newsworthy cos if so I got some karma to farm.
---
Now this is epic haha!!
---
Nice.
---
&gt; take a shot for every ship you send to the Trash.
---
I have a LOT of shit bud, that would send me to the ER for sure.
---
Oh man didn't you hear that they implemented their ESI and alliance auth so there was a drastic decrease in characters. You don't even have a source what the fuck stop tweeting.
---
&gt;LOL sorry but I don't believe you
---
Nobody cares.
---
&gt;I would conjecture that you use being a dickwad online as an outlet.
---
You can conjecture whatever the fuck you want, it doesn't change you being dumb or wrong.  I act like this because this is me, sorry you're a fake ass bitch that puts on masks for people but its just not my thing.
---
And I'd be this way right to your face with a smile on bud.
---
Ah. Just 21000 then. Well played.
---
Grrr Goons
---
 if so why is there alpha clone? remove as alpha accounts now to play just paying let's see how long eve will keep with old players.
---
More like Eve will turn 30 and every identifiable problem along the way will be smugged at on Reddit by a bitter idiot with a weak sense of self remediated by feeding on misfortune. One who uninstalled the game in 2019.
---
So we've got that to look forward to, for years and years, oh boy!
---
 i have 2 omega accounts but i no have money to pay my 12 alts if not with own money in game.
---
Better than being laughed at by everyone
---
Yeah I got confused for a minute the other day on r/all about something something CCP
---
But then we'd have to reinstall to accept the contract. Eww.
---
Avoid the corp invite spam you get in eve mail too.
---
Ye no.
---
I think they are admitting it.
---
A lot of people cheat in a lot of ways and CCP doesn’t ban them. Just because you’re not banned doesn’t mean you’re not cheating. By volume, there’s a lot of cheating out there, and some forms of cheating are harder to detect or set at a lower priority. 
---
Anyways, enjoy not being able to scoop BPCs anymore. My heart weeps for you.
---
I think that's called quitting
---
If this works put for Goons, how much if at all will this affect the hunters?  I mean no more hyperspatial fits is going to make it harder to get reliable kills.
---
that wilba guy sounds like a right jerkhead
---
I'm fairly sure those are two letters on my keyboard but I'm not sure which ones.
---
wow epic post bro really funny great stuff love ur content keep up the good work
---
Weren't they developing a mobile version of eve? Any word on that?
---
Lol. Really convenient for you to act all  dismissive, because of course it lets you off having to address my response
---
I find the "fake ass bitch" remark absolutely hilarious. Newsflash bud: having to control one's emotions is not only not a sign of weakness but the opposite, and an expected part of being an adult
---
By your lamebrained logic somebody who keeps their cool in a sad or a scary situation is a "fake bitch". No, they should be crying their head off, in keeping with how they really feel!
---
The real you is nothing to be proud of, Garth, on the contrary you sound like a fucking moron. If I didn't know better I'd ask if you seriously believe the airheaded nonsense you're spouting
---
You're getting bodyslammed into the mud again and again, yet you keep getting up for more. I love it!
---
Yes, yes.  [O](http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/Tom-Gauld-comics-myjetpack-1917779.jpeg)f course.
---
&gt; You're getting bodyslammed into the mud again and again
---
Lol what, what is it you think is happening right here bud? Does your weird shit actually work on anybody?  How calm do you feel with your multiple posts claiming victory over something that literally hasn't happened?
---
You are soft and weak shorty, you've had an argument with yourself for 4 hours while me and the rest of this subreddit sat making fun of you.  And you feel like you won.  
---
Sure you're calm.
---
Welcome to serenity.
---
Joining Imperium is a fancy way of saying becoming goons pets.
---
WoW Classic is fun. I won EVE too. Just lurk to watch it die
---
Why do people keep saying this shit?
---
Of they only cared about this they never would have done anything to shake up the game like the drifter invasions, blackout or cyno changes.
---
They would have just coasted or spat out new hype ships.
---
I feel like you of all people probably shouldent throw that stone basil.
---
SKILLING SPREE WILL CONTINUE UNYIL MORALE IMPROVES
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
yea, you know whats funny?  this wow classic everybody freaked out about is literally just the wow i remember. I never knew what they'd done with the game, evidently its hilarious.
---
That's exactly the issue.
---
They can replace the item on the store (or at least delist the old one) with the new one.
---
Why didn't they?
---
It being "a different program" doesn't matter. They can just use the same package name and issue it as an update.
---
So then thats a yes about the medication thing...
---
Hm, he aint entirely wrong there...
---
I knew this was bc zeta doesn't want me to kill his imp  the next time he rams my alt in a rlml caracal to try save pharm in his retri. It all makes sense now. 
---
Serious though Zeta gotta give you props for bringing it out mate. O7
---
You can contact me in game (Kristalll) if you want some advice and guidance through your journey.

I won't be logging in for a week or so (I'm logged out in a hostile wormhole and I'm traveling so only have my laptop, which would just be a bigger risk to login with than not) but I can still read and reply to evemails.
---
So that's a yes to the question "Is Garth illiterate?"
---
The reason people are angry is because this particular use case is pretty much the only thing null krabs use bookmarks for.
---
Providence still has 100 man battles
---
So it took you 6 months?

You can buy blue loot at about 5% over npc buy price. Completely untraceable if it is jetcanned from one player to another.
---
you think this is good?
---
ever seen wibla after a few drinks? that's even better.
---
if you want state handouts, follow state rules.
---
is it really that hard to grasp?
---
just like if you want street lights, police services, health care, fire fighters etc you obey the law and pay your taxes. in space, it's very much the same.
---
If you don’t think fighting in eve is meaningful, maybe fortnite is more your thing?
---
A world run by internet meme space lords, picturing that in my minds eye, made me laugh out loud
---
Insurance is based on materials or "base cost" not on the price of the ship.
---
I don't know anything about null sec warfare, I just see the impact of capitals on low sec roams.
---
But isn't the cat already out of box ? I mean every industrial nerf to capital construction just give an advantage to people with already a stockpile.
---
Main trouble with capitals is their application and the fact they break the "bigger is not better in every situation" Eve logic.
---
Why not nerf their application to smaller targets, remove E-War from fighters, increase size of anom rats so cap ratting remain a thing and allow carriers/super carriers to jump with sub caps players embedded in their hull... like a carrier ?
---
Umbrella would still be a thing but cap warfare would rely on team coordination and sub cap support.
---
We would face "normal" subcaps players we could kill instead of fighters which now are the equivalent of a blinged to death ( in fact even blinged beyond the grave) dramiel for a cost of almost nothing. The fighters would still erase any battleship or battlecruisers trying to erase the sub cap support which the carrier/super carrier brought with him.
---
I mean when we fly Arty BS fleets, we love our target painting newbros. Why upgrading to caps should change this love ?
---
As for faxes why not make reps depend on signature radius. Sure it would lead to some weird strategies with mwd on or other sig blooming mechanisms but it would be a trade off : you don't want MWD on your sub cap if the other side use torpedoes or poor tracking guns.
---
Just throwaways ideas, I never lived in null sec so it's more to participate to the discussion than anything else.
---
That's my concern too. It looks really cool, but steamcharts also paints it as being literally unplayable due to population issues.
---
&gt; the company is spending 80% of their effort trying to attract you at **your** expense, so maybe it is a good time to join.
---
ftfy
---
Was in alpha mode for quite a whike and I gotta be honest, it ain't bad. Living the highsec life. No alliance leaders barking at you to join their fleets. No pings on discord no fleet commanders foaming out of tgeir mouths on mumble for you bringing a Drake. Just chill running highsec dedsites, trig anoms and chats with randoms in local. Making more friends then being in a alliance.
---
Like Destiny?
---
I mined my bantam in my corvette and my osprey in my bantam.   
---
Then quit for a bit on my way to the megathron (which I needed for more mining)
---
It is as traceable as every other method in that regard. The issue was never the technical possibility, it's simply the classical choice between pest and cholera. Either have an automatism and get a ton of false positives (among other issues like overlooking certain ways, etc) or do it manually and need ages to get things done because of a severe lack in manpower (last thing i heard was team security having 2 people).
---
Read first as CCCP
---
Hey people warned that structures, mining and rorquals and 80% of the changes over recent years are bad idea.       
---
If you **ever needed better prof** now you have it.
---
Maybe he is talking about goons?
---
Or even his own members?
---
There are no 0 isk transactions on the "real" char Bill uses to launder his ISK. That char is sitting in Jita trading and about 99% of the transactions are 100% legit.
---
You just need to do enough trading that spending a couple more millions or billions here and there don't look odd.
---
You know, just like in the real world...
---
Sold for the only viable gamplay that we have left.
---
EVE is made by the Icelandic company CCP Games
---
Like i told few times before ... i don't want it.   
---
With a mod i could not shitpost ...
---
Plenty of people asked for it since CCP promised it 4 years(?) Ago
---
Hey can you login and contract all your stuff to CCP_Fozzie with info that it is for **a lowsec gate to stain** ?
---
Thank you!
---
Wow thought y'all would be better than the donut.
---
His mom says I’m special too, but not as special as you :(
---
In a way people ask for better PVE payouts.            
---
Bumping was the only way to target someone logistic routes and now **the only mechanic that allowed it** is gone.
---
Ah! Thank you. Do you know where I can find good ship fits for the different races and ships?
---
I'm a little lukewarm on the second half about the fit-crafting process (probably because I too have fit-crafted myself to death) but the first two sections (Modules and Basic Principles), HOOboy I see so many people who either try to set up a ship fit or try to hop into a ship and they have no idea about half of those mechanics or their backgrounds, and it's great to see a shot of all that information in one place.
---
I would say though, that the General EWAR section could use an extra shoutout to tackle modules, both for damage application and spreading potential, because especially in the small-gang combat that both of us (wormholer^(btw)) find ourselves in a lot, tackle modules are extremely common and allow you to very easily turn a small victory into a crushing one.
---
Because you could not even form EU country under one president.
---
&gt; **Gross** domestic product
---
If you don't want to be a mod you should come up with arguments why making you a mod would be a bad idea...
---
Oh look, Tribute Alliances not so independent after all? MORE SHOCKING NEWS AT 11!
---
It is in China
---
don\`t U dare to touch my KiKi :FDSA....
---
What..?
---
I don't have to.     
---
I need to accept being a mod no one can force you to be one.
---
Fire raining from the sky, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria! Seriously though, what the fuck is going on in EVE right now? Some Chinese dude bought an entire alliance, now Rote joins the Imperium...
---
Just no
---
have somone start a holding corp and everyone can subscribe to the bookmark ACL for that corp to share BM's
---
I wish my ass produced something as interesting as statistics and graphs.
---
moron OP thinks SA == GSF
---
I guess I didn't lay the sarcasm on well enough.  Fully sarcastic remark.
---
Just yes. Nah, kidding, we'll break it and rebuild the blue donut on day 1.
---
You could haul 40 bil ijnyour freighter anyways as long as you had a/some Webber's. 
---
What's stopping you from banking in balle par example?
---
You didn't. You just went straight off-topic and I haven't noticed. I apologize for assuming people are more constructive then they are.
---
Yes (short version)
---
IMO : Eve is the greatest "PVP" mmo I have ever played. But sadly, it is more and more difficult to find fights, because the space is too big for the number of player online and a lack of dev to encourage PVP. The irony. But still, it's a very good game, you just need to be patient. Eve =/= instant fun
---
That’s a Ishkur. Don’t mess with my cool green drone boat.
---
And as of today, you can scratch Rote from that list.
---
This is probably trash.
---
Here are your rorquals and excavators, now mine those r64s comrade
---
That’s just a small part of the effect they had on LP, as someone else said in this thread, they are broken, and it’s not because of how easy it is making puller alts.
---
how about not killing other people's dogs? or any dogs, for that matter?
---
the anticipation of planetside 2 was so huge as the first one was so good. Then it came out and it was trash. Made me sad.
---
For people asking for a translation - the English text after trig letters is literally that...

Tbh can you post it as separate post?

It could be interesting read from your point of view. 
---
Thx
---
Don't you fucking dare touch my hawk!!!
---
I have a feeling that there's no need to prove anything to be Falcon, he understands how things work (mostly). His announcement of the blackout end shows that. It's just sad that he can't really affect most of the things
---
&gt; fund said content  
---
[ratting apologists be like](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c20mfn/krablyfe/)
---
anyway so what if you need to take a couple extra steps to do what you did before lmfao   
---
slightest alteration to one particular style of krabbing and you bet some carebear is whining on the forums with a stick up his ass
---
Ruse or real? If it's real then I guess the end is closer than what some eve players think.
---
I'd rather quit eve than sitting in a boring mining op.
---
I am trying more or less the same since 2008 and still nothing v0v
---
Unspoken are pretty close with Rote, they might not do too well without an ally.
---
Any of the various little groups in Vale who don't have a backer could fall as well. Most groups in Tribute have a batphone so idk.
---
https://i.imgur.com/iLm4SIc.jpg
---
Well, yeah. But we have specific case of people referring to SA and OP using shorthand "goon" which works in the context of SA being mentioned.
---
Then again, I don't know what's up with SA's culture these days and whether they even use the term now.
---
Well this is hot garbage, guess I need a new corp
---
I read to the point he said something dumb like delaying local is a good thing. Anyone able to tl;dr the rest?
---
People who dont think this are wrong.
---
Stuff like that might just promote un-fun styles of pvp gameplay. And not the actual fun stuff. It might just make things worse.
---
True that, several things I used to enjoy are no longer possible.
---
So can't log out untill you uninstall? Not too bad
---
Why roam to places where everyone just avoid fights likenthe plague when I can go to your Masters space and fight the Good fight against PH?
---
Ye everyone could have seen this coming ten years ago
---
I think that's in the op
---
Thanks bro
---
1v1 me on the Nourv gate at 0500, for honour
---
But NATO is exactly analog of an alliance in Eve, it's like Nato + another Nato (I don't know another military block).
---
Well in perspective of lowsec group I’ll say Zarmazd is better than guardian atm.
---
They are better against e-war thanks to more midslot, also it’s more multibox-able due to no cap chain.
---
However biggest strength of zarmazd is better tank and speed (unlike you said), it’s matter a lot, since guardians are very fragile and get caught eventually by loki web / long range weapons.
---
The only downside that zarmazd has is the bad rep amount (You don’t have time to spool up if enemy has brain), but It can solved by bringing a bit more logi.
---
Obviously yes, he's in Theran. Who knows about this post though.
---
Blobs can feather right?
---
&gt; "Op sucks dick"
---
It's on Reddit
---
Stimulus is recruiting
---
Can i have your stuff
---
Press F brother
---
Haha, dude, this is a challenge hey
---
It's legitimately on Reddit
---
What else is in the headlines?
---
You thought wronggggg
---
Tell me, how many times did Test batphone goons? You seem to know all about this
---
Memes are funny
---
More of a "mass tryhard migration" they all roam freely on the WOW servers now.....
---
Joining a group is the start- and endpoint for many of the careers in the graph.
---
"Join goons" mostly affects the "difficulty" rating.
---
r/eve is biggest group of cry babies ever.
---
any reaction of CCP so far? I wouldnt wonder if not. They are used to ignoring FW and Low Sec at all.
---
Sure it would be cool but CCP are using what is almost a supercomputer to host tranquility. Even a small map for a couple thousand players is still a huge investment.
---
&gt; A small cosmetic change 
---
What you are asking for is in no way a "small" change, mate. Aside from the work involved in making the T2 variants of the hulls, they'd have to replace all the skins as well. Lots of artist time invested into a change the would barely even be noticed by most players, and those who would notice it would probably have as many people disliking it as liking it.
---
I personally don't really care either way, but I do think their time would be better spent on other things. I mean, the skin makers might consider making new skins for some of the hulls that aren't just variants on that fugly leopard gradient shit. Maybe it's just me, but making my ships look like a close-up of a herpes infection at varying stages of development isn't really an improvement.
---
theres a soundcloud of grath kicking off when PL lost like 6 supers or something inc the first pirate super ever killed, whatever its called (too lazy to google). The rant about 12 spies and the best spy network and stupidity and incompetence is so unbelievably epic its become one of my life goals if I ever win the lottery and become filthy rich to hire grath to roast me at the "fk you all Im rich now losers" celebration party Im gonna hold. 
---
 Hes a hero we need, but dont deserve.
---
meh, ccp trains people to buy isk by selling plex, and when people find cheaper prices suddenly its wrong.
---
Yea, that's what I was thinking.
---
Insmotherland calls!
---
Would actually be nice if people listed playstyles that deteriorated over time here.
---
You forgot to mention that widespread use of cynos and bridges/flex gates was a major factor in killing gate camps, since those two mechanics entirely bypass normal gates.
---
Arguably, their contribution was bigger than nullified ceptor shuttles.
---
guess facts are different ... because at the start of the end of the old NC. i saw more fights and they were much more evenly!
---
It's impossible for them to appease the crybabies now tho. Whether the blackout is on or not, there will always be crybabies whining. It's only different groups of them, depending on the situation.
---
Just look at your own post. You are quite literally whining at them right there.
---
I'm fucking space poor and i'll put it to good use murdering nerds
---
Gatecamping never dies. Long live those under the sentry gun fire.
---
can i also join? am in this shit corp that just joined imperium
---
I wish they would kill your shit posts.
---
Blackout killed null botting in an instant. If ccp did not want bots then they'd not have lifted the black out.
---
Bots are here till the end now. Stop complaining about this fact, you will live longer. If you need more ISK in game then get tourself a few more bot accounts and a nord vpn sub.
---
fair enough - but now the difficulty ranges from "barely possible" to "easily possible from day one" with little to no in-between, as it's the eve way, having percentages just to mask some binary.   
---
Twas just a friendly jab too, no hating on the goons, they just grow out of necessity rn.
---
the curse of C-J6 with eng subs
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOhnyDLpI9U
---
This defeatist attitude is what perpetuates the blue donut.
---
Even a few years after the start ccp was shaping player entity in null by providing T2BPC's to pet players. There was also lots more events, every week almost that handed key assets to people.
---
Also moon material was a completely automated affair that required no human interaction other than picking up and delivering to market and even some botted that part too.
---
yea, I do my part but I get that most of the players don't.   
---
also atm I think goonswarm can't even do something else but grow, self propelled by its own growth.   
---
I think only ideology can be a meaningful conflict driver and people just don't have time for that anymore, it seems.
---
PM me for details of the old FHC private server. Still going btw, on Dominion age currently, iirc
---
Yeah, sure, this game's problems only exist in our mass delusion. Whatever you say
---
Now it works differently.    
---
MTU baiting != old can baiting.          
---
I knew people that sit in osprey whole day mining to a can waiting for someone who will try to steal from a "miner" same for people trying bait the miners.            
---
Due to how it worked people did logoff traps in higsec.      
---
They put miner on belt, waited for someone to try to poke him and then logged in to shoot the guy.    
---
People were more willing to do it as only corporation of involved guy could shoot you - and you could check on local if someone is here.
---
Its very easy to keep people neutral until an op comes up.
---
rest in piss.
---
You can list more items ;)
---
It's not "much harder" it's not about difficulty. It's about the amount of inconvenience this brings. 
---
You can no longer just post up 10 contracts and go to bed
---
You can no longer play in a shitty TZ and hope to sell escalations to someone in a different TZ (which will lead to a shift in prices, popular TZ escalations will be more valuable while off TZ ones will drop in price)
---
You no longer have any proof of a scam in case you plan to report it to alliance leadership
---
There's a limit of 30 folders for bookmarks. How many will you use up for personal use and how many will remain for trading escalations (it's 1 folder per escalation now)
---
Maybe they need to get some mining and krabbing done?
---
What you are saying is that someone on the CSM lobbied for a change that benefits their group? I am shocked.. though I think it is worse in this case because this is purely to counter other people as TAPI doesn't have the mental capability to do it themselves.
---
This game is falling off a cliff.
---
Hey. It must be hard to run your bots all day and actually interact with the game and people in it.
---
I see 5 lights
---
death is less than ideal, but it's a tradeoff...
---
It is when it's turned into chasing potential new players from the game in this sub- Almost as if some WANT players to stay away- justifying their REEEE'ing.
---
  I'm not denying there needs to be a road map- But the past 2 months have proven this subreddit is not the place to discuss it. It's too bipolar wanting change, then not wanting change. By wanting action taken on botters, then crying the login stats are dropping when a purge is done. By demanding action taken on caps/supers travelling the galacy, then crying their gameplay is ruined when change is taken. 
---
  Listening to the players is a mistake. 
---
  Set a road map. Stick to it. Adapt or die.
---
What are you even fucking talking about? I listed reasons why this change makes life harder, you shittalk about botting. Go fuck yourself...
---
I think the BPC should not drop in a container at all, but straight into FC's station hangar. lmao. jk
---
“When most ships are small, fast and nullified.”
---
So, this statement has been terribly mistaken on multiple levels. People general never roamed in BS’s cause they are god awfully slow for warping. 
---
Nanoing has been a thing since I even started the game. Which was 2013. Gate camps still happen, but with the rise of tools like near2 and other intel scrappers there is less of a need for them. 
---
Gate camping is also about as interactive as blopsing on miners. 
---
Only things that can be nullified are inties, which aren’t killing anything by themselves anyways, and T3Cs. 
---
Yeah people also went towards faster ships because brawl ships just get supers dropped on them. With nano ships you have more control over the engagement.
---
The problem with you was that if 5 people opened the wreck the moment it appeared on grid ... it was already empty for all people and you were warping off.     
---
On many occasions you always managed to pickup stuff in the tick that wreck appeared and you were able to do it so fast that people who opened the wreck seen it empty or all content that you could move to your fleet hangar was gone.        
---
Once someone said that "stuff blinked as he opened the wreck"     
---
You have fast and ... well way to fast.         
---
You cannot use loot all as can is fleet hangar size.      
---
You always sit at 0 cloaked until it dies.       
---
You cannot see the % and know at what second it will die even with 1% left, yet you were always the fastest.
---
How many (pvp) alts do 0-Cal people use?? I only have a main, dread alt, and hunter alt.
---
There are some players that have been able to find even faster ways than chori, he just has enough autismo power to be available for a lot more sites.
---
Oh lordy yes. I can see it now, 15 posts in a row with *Reserved for Future content* so that the shitposts can all be in one big row.
---
We're still trying to raise hell in null, though we do it from a null sec static WH now :)
---
I don't know if Choridon uses a loot script or not, but I do know what he claims to do. All of the points you bring up are taken care of using this method. Baltrom and co figured it out with a couple hours on SISI and out-looted Choridon on their first attempt. They don't have a CSM candidate, though, so I guess they were forced to adapt instead of having the game changed to fit their unwillingness to learn.
---
You seem to have missed I'm promoting more PvE that'd be better tuned to be run in fits &amp; fleets that have a chance of fighting back. Such as Sleeper and Incursion setups, so you can reward bringing logi, even tackle, and knowledge of how PvE content escalates &amp; can be leveraged during a contested site.  
---
So CCP could make more engaging PvE, and it'd lead to and be sustained by more distributed PvP.
---
Quick AAR:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
* Minnie fort in Kamela RFd into hull
---
* 0-Cal forms Nightmares with a few guys from Project Gungnir + some mates
---
* We're kinda neutral, but minnies are way outnumbered so no point in going for them. and ending things early
---
* DHSJ (arnour BS), Spectre Fleet (Kikis), CVA (Nightmares) are all there to kill the fort plus some randos
---
* We cyno in once timer is paused, load system and snort our coke
---
* Fight for an hour or so, push everyone but CVA off grid, Fort timer saved long ago but both BS fleets stay on grid to duke it out
---
* The only good boosh of the night puts us in a bad position, so we warp to regroup, start seeing gfs in local so we're all done
---
Good old fashioned sub fight, no significant cap drops.
---
Lowsecs good guys win again.
---
GFs all round, thats how the game should be played.
---
It’s more people don’t want to spend the effort
---
You won’t beat goons by harassing them or hunting their line members
---
You need to go after their leadership and “Theta”.  Their disctatorial style alliance would have shit rolling so quickly and hard downhill that it’d destroy the alliance
---
Why would I go and rat in a "conflict system"?
---
most of us have 3+ as it is one of our  requirements
---
What is reading the actual post before commenting...
---
Because that's where the decent rat spawns would be, the ones worth your time.
---
They are upset because, again, CCP is removing a way of playing EVE.
---
I think you missed the sarcasm in the title after reading the post itself.
---
Most players who run Sotiyos in game (Aside from TEST) all say this is going to drastically hurt their chances of running them, after talking to Ron, it seems pretty clear that he agrees that it's a shitty solution too, and it's just fucking over the rest of the playerbase because TEST is mad that they lost 2 Komodo BPCs to ninja looting. 
---
If you agree that Ninja Looting is too easy, and it should be easier for the force on grid that ran the site to get the loot, and I would probably agree with you here, then why not just have an ESS like mechanic where you have to sit around for 30 seconds to access it and take the loot, this still allows you to ninja if the runners are really sloppy or you have other tricks in your arsenal, while giving 30 seconds for the runners to get a HIC/Ceptor or whatever on your DST. Seems like a better solution than than saying fuck you to everyone who doesn't own bridging titans for freighters, as well as making it impossible to realistically loot if anyone is in position to nync your freighter. 
---
All this does is mean that Sotiyos will be ran exclusively by TEST or Goons (If the Sotiyo spawns in Delve or Esoteria). Otherwise they won't be run which means a really niche activity gets taken behind the Shed and everything that CCP seems to want to change about massive null blocs being the only way of survival in nullsec
---
any pve will be easy bottable, so whats your point?
---
but blackout also killed tons of players too. Nobody in his sane mind would go out rat while being blindfolded.
---
I guess now were gonna see a bunch of "confessions of a botter" posts now so people can conveniently deny their betting too
---
What more could be done to "removing local in null"? 
---
  Btw it's f2p. He doesn't have to pay a cent to play.
---
  But hey, whatever, let the salty fucks have their say- I'm taking a break from this sub. It's a fucking cesspit of whinging - no wonder why devs rarely post here anymore. 
---
  Good luck.
---
Could internet / ping have anything to do with it?
---
Imagine quoting Ron as a reference.
---
Is it mean of me to have no sympathy at all for folks that fly caps to have to have a alt in a ship that costs a fraction of a cap?
---
So with more engaging PvE, and more readily available PvP, you think people will instead... go to highsec that'd had singificantly reduced isk payouts? Quit even though there's far more content not requiring hours/all week to prep for?
---
No, not at all. As much as it is a pain I think it’s very healthy for the game when people have to weigh risk vs reward when it comes to dropping caps. Though if you wonder into delve I’m sure they still drop with no concern.
---
Thanks to all involved, was an absolute blast. :)
---
Em.....

By admit I assume you mean share, as there is no "guilt / bad" thing in it? :P
---
Sure, I'll find my list somewhere in the stacks of other lists &amp; add it to the post.
---
how is hongkong related to eve and CCP?? Why so many upvotes for this?
---
Eh?  What alliances did anything of the sort?
---
Oh Cable
---
They do drop officier module
---
You're like the caricatured man sitting on a stack of gold, crying crocodile tears. If this change makes your game life sob much harder, it's clearly the only aspect of the game that matters to you.
---
I did it got removed for spam :(
---
I went with my nidd. Nidhoggur is alive still.
---
I recently injured my right (mouse) hand, and can't use it. I do a lot of industrial manufacturing and having to use the mouse to rightclick to open the context menu is getting old.
---
Is there a KB shortcut that will let me assign 'Open Context Menu' or something similar? The menu key won't work like it normally does in windows.
---
Something, something, adapt or die?
---
As much retarded as it is, isn't the main point of Chaos Age to bring change to stagnant aspects of the game, and see which version is better?
---
On the side of scrips, yeah I don't believe that you weren't using any. There are simply too many records of situations that state that it's borderline impossible to loot it just by hand. But I'll look forward to your video. I just hope it'll be truly genuine record.
---
I don't think you understand this game or the people who play it.
---
Where fuck u buying 20 injectors for 50$ thats not new player info at all. Lmfao. Yall making excuses to keep ur game niche instead of expanding.
---
you built it..... lol... a battleship was rare, and a big deal cos it took weeks to mine it in your osprey..... no joke.
---
CCP also stands for Chinese Communist Party, and have you not heard about everything happening in Hong Kong? Basically the Chinese government is beating and killing civilians protesting the cruel regime of the Chinese Government.
---
We means test welfare recipients, is that fascism?
---
I still remember going on a stratop fleet for the first one of these things.  There were loads of us in Punishers.  After all the effort we put into it, somebody literally moon-walked out with the BP.
---
So no, I don't give a shit about your thieving mini-game.  imho if you want it, lock the system down.  If you can't, tough titty.
---
All that effort to get into the CSM and the only thing he impacts is to nerf a ninja looter ROFL.
---
Main, dread alt, fax alt, super alt, 2nd dread alt plus a hauler. But technically I'm not in 0-Cal as I dont play at the moment. ;)
---
There is nothing to propaganda over.
---
wow, times must be hard, i remember rote kapelle being someone. with standards
---
Why do you think all alliances had ballots with representives from their alliance in #1 position?
---
It has been this way for a long long time. The CSM is to lobby and leak for their alliances.
---
thank you
---
jebaited!
---
blackout proved to CCP, if they are successful and stop botting, they make tonnes less money.
---
this means all efforts on botting removal (no dont mean account bans that achieve nothing) has ended
---
That's just the words his FC told him to say
---
There's a range interval where you can be in loot range of a 'can' and still be cloaked.
---
You do realize most of us was pro blackout when it came out and only changed our minds when numbers plummeted. I personally loved the blackout but that doesn't change the fact that it wasn't healthy for the game.
---
your memory must be fuzzy
---
very
---
I have a feeling that if any alliance told their members to stay docked during the BO then it would have died...
---
You're gunna wave your hand right off of your arm at this rate.
---
There are a few ways to detect it, but best way is to launch medium drones and just pop it when it does uncloack.
---
&gt; Exactly s in the case in which aryth tried to remove the mer, we have proof once again that the csm is not a focus group as many like to believe
---
Might not be the best example, given that removing the MER wouldn't really have been in our best interests.
---
in fact, to many (including me) "die" (in terms of quitting) is a preferable way of dealing with all shit CCP wants us to adapt to. Let em stagnate into oblivion with all the carebear changes they've done for years to this game.
---
That is 175 bucks per character. That is not that much money when spread over a year. Not all that impressive when you look at the bigger picture. Will watch the video here in a bit, but if it is anything like other GDP in Eve videos, the author will be using bad numbers and completely miss other factors as well.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I am fully aware it's just some dumb linemember shit, I just want him to realize that aswell by making him retrace his own logical path.
---
Why catch when you can just stop em dead. Bring back blackout.
---
dont invade the enemy, if you do that they can make money!
---
None of your extra methods are impacted by the changes listed by StainGuy that killed Belt Ratting. The two groupings therefore don't need to be mutually incompatible.
---
Belt Ratting was an alternative to anoms by people who liked their ratting to be a bit more jack-potty than anoms but not as jack-potty as exploration was. In some areas belt ratting of course is the ultimate jack-potting as you try and get officer spawns.
---
No reds to shoot, must make reasons to shoot blues.
---
Blackout didn't stop botting. It slowed long enough for them to redo their programs, but it was still there.
---
Csm is bad for the game, you get a bunch of null leaders pushing for their own personal agenda
---
What is your ingame name?
---
They honestly could have fixed this by just making the container for the loot the size of a jetcan instead of a Sotiyo wreck. The entire issue with ninja looting atm is that its impossible to screen the 200km wide wreck with a reasonable number of players.
---
If there were a focal point to fight over then you would have a mad scramble to a single point that would be an actual fight rather than the current grab and go mechanics that discourage any actual fight over the loot.
---
I like the idea of a booster that helps you repair standings, all they had to is to fix standing penalty reduction (legacy code issues? idk).
---
Ok, I should have added a /s to my commit about belt ratting, this whole post is whiny and I meant to post a change that is almost insignificant.
---
my mistake. the end is maybe nigh in the future, possibly then
---
Yeah putting drag bubbles between staging station and jumpbridge pos was nice way to catch stragglers.          
---
But CCP linked those structures to citadels and nerfed the drag bubble ranges to 500km.           
---
I miss old day when drag bubble pulled you from warp if you just crossed it.      
---
Remember those 20AU warps between gates and drag bubble 5AU before destination :D
---
Your lock time is longer than the time needed to decloak, point, and cyno up.
---
IM RETARDED if i think it was good lol..
---
bro its only the retards that didnt enjoy it or be able to deal with it.
---
the numbrs went rocketing down because the 1000's of bot accounts got turned off.
---
then a couple of 1000 casuals who think they can own a super/titan/rorqual/JF quit because now it was a challenge to do these TOP TIER things now in eve.
---
the cyno changes ae HARSH i agree, like it seriously harsh, but its fine. be nice if a FEW more ships could light a cyno, maybe rookie ships still to light an industrial version of a cyno. but all in all its fine tbh.
---
the local thing however is what i refer to mostly. it was the single best thing to ever happen to nullsec. all and anyone who thinks otherwise, sorry, your just not the type eve used to be played by, which made eve the way it was.    admit it, your just scared and unskilled and dont know how to solve the problems, that i and my group solved. it was fun, and easy. and SUPER exciting
---
because one would be the stronger side, yes this would push activity to an active boarder, but one side would be able to farm, defend, and successfully attack better than the other.
---
this means the ones that are loosing or would loose before they even try they know they just wont fight.
---
its much like this now, people know too much, they know whatll happen, theres too much at stake if it goes belly up. so people make the informed decision to not fight.
---
Oh this was not it.      
---
Like people mostly died in cruisers and battleships to it.     
---
I managed to get orca once or twice this way - aka i mined "his rock" to a can next to him.       
---
He decided that "IT IS HIS ORE" and take it from the can :D       
---
Countless times there was also something like thorax that warped in to belt and moved all ore to his can waiting for me to shoot him.       
---
Then it was just point and people from my corp logging to land near us.
---
theres rules,
---
dont take botting a rorqual mining mindlessly from nullsec players
---
dont take solo ignore everyone around me away from hisec players
---
dont give lowsec players a reason to complain, they have enough of those already.
---
&gt; All this does is mean that Sotiyos will be ran exclusively by TEST or Goons (If the Sotiyo spawns in Delve or Esoteria).
---
You do realize that there are other large entities with super umbrellas that aren't us, right?
---
How do you constantly say the dumbest shit all the time?
---
The mistake was putting local in the game in the first place and I am pretty sure if they would make EVE 2.0 it would not be there.
---
Pretty sure you could argue that the rewards are too high for the current level of risk. And Blackout was just evening things up.
---
What are the biggest bonuses of Null vs Low? Owning Sov, and more profit. And what are the penalties to living in Null instead of Low? None, it's exactly the same. You can get hotdropped either way.
---
At least when they took away free Intel, it made it more risky to justify all that extra profit you get in Null. If you're afraid, then go to Low so you don't earn as much, but you can see them coming.
---
My CSM candidacy was not rejected due to RMT accusations, and there is no evidence of this being the case.
---
I have multiple times encountered bugs to the game which I have played with for a bit and then reported to CCP on several occations. The above mentioned is indeed one of them, it was not an old bug but a newly created one when CCP changed the mechanics regarding weapon signatures.
---
I personally think that is one of the reasons why I should qualify as a very competent player since I live and play at the forefront of the game finding bugs again and again. (Reason why I've not been banned for using said bugs is that there were not declared as exploits at that time and were only done so (or fixed) after I provided CCP with the knowledge that they even existed.
---
There is another bug currently which I've told CCP about and they are aware of it. I played with it 2-3 times, told CCP and then walked away from it. :)
---
Merk is love, Merk is life.
---
He can get angry tho. If you, after getting told not to shoot some guys, still shoot and kill them (it was a small neutral newbie corp).
---
This is bad why?           
---
Like whole reason of gatecamp is to kill traveling people.        
---
Before the ceptors people used alt in cheap ship to scout ahead - many times you just stopped at some point and have to go back as you had a gatecamp that you had no way to pass.            
---
Now they just go blindly.
---
no, I'm not referring to the cyno changes but to the cyno itself, with no way to tell when 100 bombers are going to be dropped on your head. you are retarded if you think that you'd have enough fish to shoot in the barrel for an extended period of time.
---
no they dont lmao have you roamed against provi? they fully subscribed to the helldunk or blueballs strategy.
---
roam there solo in kitey shit? everyone docks
---
roam there solo in brawly shit? get 20+ rhml phoons to the face
---
roam there in a small group (less than 20)? they take forever to form and then its an ezpz 60 cerbs with basis
---
roam there in a large fleet (over 100)? TEST shows up
---
its more effort than its worth unless you go to the Shintant pocket, those dudes sometimes give gudfites.
---
or hear me out. dreads shouldn't have HAWs and BS shouldn't need special guns to shoot caps
---
They moved to high sec etc botting didn't stop in blackout.
---
people will always farm..... there will be less, numbers will balance out.
---
as the weak and thick retards stop mining, i make more isk/hour mining with my experiance skills and ability (and teamwork)
---
let them leave, let there be more money for me to make.
---
people will always fill the gap. thats whats magical about eve.
---
I meant that from all the members one knows what he s taking about and the others don't have any expertise in the domain. Who on the csm could speak about the API and automatisation with knowledge similar steve ronuken? Or about whs referring to exooki?
---
Then you go to high sec for the same rewards and less isk.
---
How is that good for the game?
---
Belt ratting was one of the income sources in NPC space where you don't have anomaly spawns.         
---
Jackpots were also faction spawns that had a value before the escalation increase in sov space.       
---
I remember that getting a active armor resist from a faction rat paid for new battlecruiser.        
---
Now .. now they are often as cheap as T2 versions.
---
The accusations are that I use a loot script / bot / some other cheat.
---
I think the burden of proof is entirely on them and / or CCP.
---
Why should I have to provide evidence that I am innocent? (this would also reveal the way that I do it giving up my apparent advantage, and why would I do that when that would game me essentially nothing).
---
I am open to making changes to NPC sotiyos, there are several things that could be better, but this specific change is 100% made cause a few individuals are mad at another individual and shouldn't be the basis for game changes.
---
its been added to the post.
---
I see this sentiment a lot, I feel like a middle ground is decent (I enjoyed blackout) but I also have to point out that ccp didn’t bow to pressure, it was their intention to do it for a certain amount of time and revert the change (for data and all that)
---
oh yeah there worth it just for the i have a faction dread look at how much isk i have to throw around.  but beyond that i wouldn't use them in combat because, well for the price there not worth the benefit and if you want a better dread just use a binged out tech 1.  
---
i so want one off the angel cap's to but illed settled for a blood carrier. \*i like carriers more then dread's\* love to see a blood take on the Archon and Aeon.
---
This turd stole this from a viewer. Now claims it as his own content by changing 1 box. Typical unoriginal copy/paste content from Wooly &lt;3
---
Off my desk onto someone else’s... the best kind of content
---
But what about all the elite PVPers on the test server?  (seriously there's people who only pvp on the test server and REALLY care about their killboard stats there)
---
yes, brilliant, in the last 2-3 years ive watched eve players move from hisec, (or hisec minded/skilled players) move into goons, horde, test, get told to get i rorqual, mine up fast, get into capital. rat up fast, get into titan, that so many noobs and idiots have these ships that never would have done.
---
so now owning one is becomming the challenge it used to be again, people are crying and quitting.
---
local removal made nullsec fun, dangerous, and was an perfect balance of risk/reward.
---
rorquals still make SO MUCH ISK its insane even after all these nerfs. its crazy how much they make. they make an acceptable amount of isk using t2 drones not excavs.....excavs are more than double that.
---
ratting doesnt seem to make THAT much money for the effort and isk at risk. blackout stopped people using bots as the effort was high. so people wernt ratting (thats how many people botted)
---
i think blackout showed, or should have showed that we have WAY more people botting than first though
---
I don't rat in a Domi. The point is there is no counterplay in a ratting subcap to a Blops gang in blackout conditions. The ratting amount in Delve fell by 60% during blackout, the number of subcap ratting kills stayed the same. That should be a rough marker for how much the risk side of the equation increased.
---
That's why OP is successful.  He does it with a bot.
---
1. define blue ?          
---
Go to your UI and adjust that :     
---
* No standings -&gt; this is flashing red on my screen, you shoot those people.              
---
* Set that any one with standings (including -10) is now showing as blue/green/pink  - those are your friends - you don't shoot them      
---
* Set all firends to -10 on corp alliance 
---
2. Bigger push to big blocks?         
---
Why have 20 x 10 man corporations as blue when you can get 1 corporation with 200 people.
---
People forget that you can set -10 people to "blue" in settings and make people without standings to appear red ;)
---
Or move to high sec, make the same income without the loss.
---
1) Where is the confessions here? I was expecting interesting information here like in the other "confessions" post, instead I get a "look how great I am" post.
---
2) CCP kills playstyles, deal with it. They just killed the whole of highsec freighter ganking while pretending to fix a non-existent problem of people getting stuck in geometry. Sucks, deal with it. At least, here they are honest about the reasons instead of giving some bullcrap explanation.
---
&gt;proof
---
you linked a year old BR of some volta cruisers getting caught by caps. happens every month, why choose this one?
---
yeah, on one hand I personally don't like the vintel mechanics etc (copy local and have a map update after it scrapes clipboard) but on the other hand, there is still an overwhelming amount of intel with the in game map and dotlan, etc.
---
A middle ground would be nice, a hunter shows up in local after 1 minute or when gate cloak is broken. It gives them a chance to dscan, they can't move around unseen, and they can't perma camp with no one knowing they are there.
---
I was banned on an accusation of hacking accounts, which I was proven innocent of hence why I am no longer banned.
---
Jesus fuck if somebody has continuous for 16 hours+ ticks 5 days in a roll just fucking ban it and seize all the fucking ISK! Anyone with high school sql skill can do it. Stop giving CCP excuses!
---
Yah, there are no face masks in this photo.
---
well this is what theyre for....
---
AT ships also.... theyre 404040595895 times more expensive than the examples they copy. and only slightly stronger all in all in a few ways.
---
are they worth the money? no not if you compare stats to value. but are they worth it because eve is SUPER balanced and having a small edge is huge, yes
---
i was in the icu on wednesday after my 2nd operation.. hopefully that will not happen again.
---
eve is boring af but i stick around the community because of friends (✿◠‿◠)
---
It was due to tackled members dropping corp to not ruin the alliance killboard.         
---
You cannot die if you don't undock.      
---
It was more like solution to a low KB stats problem.
---
thanks.
---
I just can't let you go big boi xD
---
I mean... yes?  Baltecs have pretty much been meat for the grinder for a long time.  Kinda the point -- t2 doctrines alone probably can't sustain our turnover (swordfleet never4get).
---
not quite sure what you are advocating for here? Even more people consolidating into supercap umbrella owning megaalliances like goons?? Because nobody else would have any mean to protect themselves from beind dropped by mostly overwhelming force.
---
but, you kill nothing, and just die..... this post is about what works.... baltecs dont... at least with goon FC's
---
hope you get better soon (◡‿◡✿)
---
ah yeh thats most likely true, but also the income of botting in highsec is far worse. So the impact on the economy in general is some factors lower.
---
Also for highsec they don't had to change the programs, and this is actually the interesting part for me.
---
Whenever I'm in a fleet I'm thinking "I could be doing literally anything else"
---
Capital hunting, other than in Stain, cause who wants to be there, is ongoing in every other LS, NS region daily by REAL PVPERs, if they are becoming a dying breed, its simply because they won EvE.
---
Jet Can Baiting, still ongoing, just you noobs are to easily offended with your thin skins and refuse to engage.
---
Gate Camping, requires both skill and patience, and you have neither nowadays. To risk adverse because your space pixels might by touched by gate guns or out blobbed by the defenders.
---
The post would have been valid &amp; legit if you would not have added the context. 
---
People commit Supers/Carriers to bash a Sotiyo, involving at least 30B where anytime during the bash, a fight/hotdrop can occur.
---
And now, you try to convince people that its unfair that things could be changed because you’ll not be able to steal loot 30-40B anymore with your 300M DST?
---
Remember the quote “no risk/no isk”
---
Tribute?  No.  Pure Blind.  We don't gate titans into hostile grids, and jammers don't come down via magic.
---
Also I do not live near a network distribution hub (as far as I know), so no I am not plugged straight into ze interwebs.
---
no they didnt forget, faction ships dont.
---
the vehement incurance was linked to build cost, the same AS ALL ships.
---
the actual build cost was basicly huge..... i think. making the insurance massive.
---
trust me. hearing how many vehements got insuranced was a massive shame. id of love to own one, haw fit it, roam die and only loose a few bill..... and imagine the content for those that killed it xD
---
i appreciate that chori finally admitted he uses loot scripts for npc sotiyo bashes and that the community is so chill about it (◠﹏◠✿)
---
but it was not the baltecs that did it (they may of fired the round that wore down the structure)
---
but thats all they were good for.
---
the titans is how they just sat thre untouch.
---
every time they got touched they fed. lost multiple 10's of billions and killed like a bill or two or newbro hordlings
---
ah yeah the extra  build cost form the serp bit you need. the other faction dread's do need them i believe its just normal build cost so there insurance is gonna be a lot lower.
---
you could have used fucking impels fit with 1 lasor each. people still wouldnt of touched the fleet, its not the baltecs that were strong xD
---
&gt;the players eve has now killed the game. 
---
No, they have adapted the way they play game to fit their lifestyle.
---
You failing to adapt to the way most people want to play the game, and expecting the game to stay the way it was, or expecting the game mechanics to be changed to force other people to play the game you think they should is what "killed" the game to you.
---
I specifically addressed this in my post. Did you not read past the first sentence?
---
bowed to crashing numbers and almost killing the game :) oh blah wow and back to school lol
---
*Anime is legal* :getout:
---
This almost feels like murderedbywords
---
Thx Hard Knocks dude.
---
Finally ccp is fixing that retarded looting mechanic. Though they chose the easiest way to do it. Rather than adding ESS interaction mechanic that locks you in bubble while looting it.
---
Took them couple of year tho.
---
nono, that is what people are doing by crying at CCP about blackout.
---
I WANT THE GAME TO CHANGE lol
---
fuck me seriously bro?
---
its those new guys, and idiots in brand new supers that cry to ccp saying cyno changes and local means theyre way of playing is ruined.
---
imsaying CHANGE THE FUCKING GAME! make it hard, make it difficult to own a titan or super or rorqual mine. hisec is open for you lazy fucks. who have only known how easy it is in goons mining spud. 100% safe
---
change it. let the meta change its how eve has been for over 10 years. and now they cant change the meta because new bros cry
---
you should be good fit to CCP office honestly, you have same understanding of RL economic as they do
---
lol
---
Sounds like you have an idea what you are talking about.
---
Or you split into 2 alliances and patchwork your areas between the two of them. Borders everywhere but with access to everything. Considering all large coalitions have many alliances in them you really don’t have to change anything except for the placement of TCU’s. For the fly in space die in space bonus if it’s good enough you just kill the cheapest ships you can find. Kind of like ADM ratting at the moment to keep PVE up. If it’s not good enough it doesn’t change anything. People don’t PVE with their expensive toys in war front because it’s a good way to die. They do already PVE with small shit to raise ADMs so not sure what you really think is going to change.
---
&gt;Grath
---
Good for him?
---
I've been that person before. 
---
I didn't bot. 
---
When the 'ticks' are 20 fucking minutes apart and the gameplay is largely zero input, that's not even hard to do while actually having a life.
---
proof?
---
Wormholer are nice people
---
I'm pretty sure we don't come up on /r/all anymore because of all the "How do you make drugs?" bait posts
---
&gt;I think the burden of proof is entirely on them and / or CCP. Why should I have to provide evidence that I am innocent?
---
That would normally be true, but at some point it shifts if the accusations have merit. What are the specific accusations?
---
&gt;I am open to making changes to NPC sotiyos, there are several things that could be better
---
But "better" in this case would likely mean making it more difficult for you to grab the loot.
---
&gt;but this specific change is 100% made cause a few individuals are mad at another individual and shouldn't be the basis for game changes.
---
There is a possibility that their interests align with an objectively good change.
---
Or even 100,000 so you can fit it in a Rorqual.
---
My position is that activities like mining and some pve is so simple and the method of "beating" a game problem is so obvious that it's impossible to distinguish human from bot like behavior.
---
But that would be easier to show than to talk about.
---
Dodging the question with an entry level psych class definition, nice move
---
I'm pretty ignorant to standing mechanics.  What's the best way to get the most out of these things? If I ran an Epic Arc like a decade ago, can I run it again?
---
Turns out that highsec pubbies who complain everyday that nullsec is too safe on the official forums are right, if a DST can ninja loot a Sotiyo wreck in it and get away safely.
---
I doubt anyone would be dumb enough to leave a bot running like that.
---
 (◕‿◕) hope you all have an amazing weekend, i'm gonna be curled up playing eve and netflixing (◕‿◕)
---
Your desperation is starting to get .. awkward. You need a catchy title though, "Change the size, get rid of Rise!" or something.
---
How about a trade in space, jet can or trading ships - I’m not sure CCP can effectively monitor this but I could be wrong.
---
Eve was better with belt ratting.
---
Players were spread out more, there was less Isk floating around, and faction mods were a lot more rare.
---
Also, you didn't really use capitals to belt rat.  Maybe you did as a meme, but warp speed was more important then DPS at a certain point.
---
Anoms killed belt ratting.  Kill anoms.
---
Hes saying it but it doesnt make it true like most things in this thread. Although i did support these changes from the start
---
It does frankly, this is a huge QOL fix for people who need to utilize multiple *new* bookmarks across multiple systems on a daily basis; and who pray tell is that? 
---
It isn't me, nor is it most of the people I know who do not live in wormholes.
---
Perhaps banning for your own good might be an idea :-)
---
off topic question, but is HKA still in Cobalt Edge? I heard they got pushed out recently.
---
Stimulus is solid.
---
Slight correction, CVA should be provibloc, CVA only actually accounted for about 30% of the fleet :P
---
looting sotiyo was riskless and took nearly zero effort, vily did for once his job pushing this change.
---
Man i miss those posts. :(
---
Sandbox and sandcastle? Say it isn't so?
---
Hahahahaha pathetic
---
&gt; That would normally be true, but at some point it shifts if the accusations have merit. What are the specific accusations?
---
But there is no evidence, ergo they have no merit.
---
I already replied what the accusation is.
---
&gt;There is a possibility that their interests align with an objectively good change.
---
There isn't it was Vily straight up campaigning for this change due to disliking ninjalooting.
---
Don't worry, like everyone else who posts but doesn't play, I banned myself.
---
yes: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Cobalt_Edge#sov
---
they lobbied to fix something that was broken*
---
RIP Grath, many good times in PL bud.
---
I lost my virginity to a dying tranny hooker and subsequently became a space hobo.
---
I'm one of the main FC's for provi and have called TEST down exactly 0 times in the last 6 months. Only time TEST shows is in USTZ occasionally for important timers if RC is calling friends/forming hard.
---
EUTZ plenty of shit to do. Seems like you're just subscribing to the whole "REEEE FUCK PROVI" bullshit that everyone spews lmao.
---
They’re TEST pets, and insmother is entirely uncontested so..
---
Jay don't you lol me young man.
---
can upboat only once, and meh CCP is too stupid to figure this out.
---
Ur gay. 
---
Come back grath!!!!
---
&gt;What more could be done to "removing local in null"? 
---
Do you get disability benefits for being born without an imagination?
---
There were lots of good suggestions for iterating upon it, because while blackout was fun it was definitely depleting the krab population in null. Some people suggested, instead of no local, having people appear in local only after the decloak timer (so they have a chance to dscan after jumping in). Or making anoms gated to give ratters more of a chance.
---
In any case, much of nullsec is built around using local as an intel tool, and it was clear that things needed to be adapted in its absence.
---
But CCP just tried one thing, and instead of tweaking it, just rolled back entirely. Classic CCP.
---
&gt;Btw it's f2p. He doesn't have to pay a cent to play.
---
No, he just has to devote a good chunk of his time, which is arguably worse.
---
&gt;But hey, whatever, let the salty fucks have their say- I'm taking a break from this sub. It's a fucking cesspit of whinging - no wonder why devs rarely post here anymore. 
---
Aww the poor babies can't handle being told their dying game is dying :(
---
This is what I used for guristas and other rats, pretty cheap, agency boosters are optional, hardshell was included just to test the fit, not needed with my skills at the end. Just change the resis type modules, drones and amno for the rats.
---
Good luck with the loot rate, was nerfed IMO.

Belt ratting existed concurrently with all of those things, primarily because small groups in NPC 0.0 could make a living doing it, and it was generally low maintenance, just like anom ratting is now.
---
There will always be people trying to min/max everything who wouldn't belt rat, but for people just trying to rat for an hour or two, that other stuff didn't work.
---
People have been suggesting this change before Vily was on the CSM and not all of them have been from tapi.
---
Was it intended? I don't think CCP had a conscious thought about it.
---
&gt; instead of attempting to counter or find an alternative method such as folks like Baltrom did (who notably out looted Choridon, much to my personal amusement) instead they ask CCP to change the dynamic in their favour because their cherished hardcore cut-throat game needs to be tailored to their own self imposed inadequacy
---
Never have I seen a more accurate statement about the state of this game right now lol.
---
Yeah, I remember that. Any bets on how long until he makes his next post about quitting?
---
Sharing bm's is going to get easier, not harder, not sure what you mean by that
---
Not true, myself and chori caught multiple looters when running the site.
---
Come find me in infinity battlescape, pretty fun
---
What about a new XL extender/3200 plate?
---
5000-word saltmine. Delicious.
---
Glad that sociopathic bullshit like this is finally getting scrubbed from the game.
---
Correction (ALL the looters)
---
T3D align time is problematic as well in low.
---
&gt;  but for people just trying to rat for an hour or two, that other stuff didn't work.
---
Abyssals do that just fine.
---
i desperately want a bromance with [dimitrios bekas](https://zkillboard.com/character/93244616/) he can rate my fit anytime
---
Its not going to drastically hurt their chances of running them. If anything, you'll see more attempts at them than currently as most groups don't bother running them after chori gets a dst on grid with it. Plus you'll likely see more contests at them with people trying to drop dreads on the freighter.
---
that's not really the same thing
---
Hope you get better soon, dude &lt;3
---
Ehefkae threw down against novac with a loggerhead recently
---
You used to see a lot of BS and BC hanging around gates or doing very small gangs before about 2011 or so. Unfortunately cynos did kind of kill off brawling T1 battleships. I remember NCdot used to completely farm out whole regions by dropping on top of anything slower than a cruiser. 
---
The warp changes obviously didn't help either. Not to mention the introduction of t3 cruisers, Attack BCs, t3 destroyers, tiericide etc.
---
&gt;all the things
---
Haha
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRdXjsGlh2s
---
Hmmmmm
---
yea I just have an issue with them being unchecked like that. There were def ways to choke them up earlier (increasing the diminishing returns slope e.g.) but obv some financial motivation was there. I can't really blame them, as you say, for wanting to make profit but, at the same time, they are not pushing out a product, like a car factory or a loan, but an \*ongoing entertainment\* product for which one can argue, I think, about putting profitability in front of long term survival. Basically they've failed the marshmallow test, as a company, in my eyes.   
---
I think it pains me to just see the game and company failing to keep up because of technical debt and desperately grasping at the low-hanging-yet-ultimately-rotten fruit. I still enjoy playing in my own niche, but I can also look at the current game as a system and feel deeply sorry about the state it has reached.
---
my bad, sorry for rushing, i just rushed through trying to find actual info. and must of clicked on the wrong battle report.
---
whos side was CO2 on in this? (it makes a difference)
---
Yes hello, who do I boson?
---
"War" is a loaded term, this idea isn't to cause full-on war, borders would just be far more common and active, a background simmering of conflict that the game's lacked for most of a decade that I recall.
---
The value of PvE is what people place on their time, if they want to min-max and are comfy with the new landscape of being very close to active friendly fleets &amp; with a far larger % of their corpmates being familiar with small gang fights, then they'll bring their shiny ships.
---
What sort of % bonuses do *you* think would be enough to encourage ratting &amp; roaming gangs? How often do you think PvP losses should occur, &amp; how else might they be rewarded/encouraged?
---
I’m a long term bitter vet, and if a new server started up with no injectors, no excavators, I’d go over to that. The current game is broken. The body hasn’t figured out the heart is stopped
---
The in game channels will notify you in the same way.
---
It just uses a visual indicator rather than an audio one.
---
The best suggestion I've seen is an ESS mechanic, where you need to stay on grid for a minute or two to loot it.  Meaning grid control is paramount to extracting the cache, and the ability to generate content by ganking the looter also exists.
---
Cloaking a DST 2300 meters off the Sotiyo and trying to scoop it as fast as possible is not good game play.
---
MER is the new zKill
---
Please provide your source then so I can be properly corrected.
---
This is bad because you will not have logs in cases of unexpected game close.
---
The game mechanism against that would probably stem from fleets being made public to those with positive standings, but it's a good example of how people will rapidly try work around half-arsed ideas &amp; implementations.
---
i dono how long shit takes to get put out to you guys. we're like 50 irl dudes and very informal so it takes minutes.
---
You know Chori doesn't live in England or London right kiddo?
---

---
😂😂😂
---
&gt; What Can You Do To Help
---
As always, we'll keep reinforcing this message and stressing it every month - DON'T RMT, AND DON'T GET INVOLVED WITH BOTTING.
---
Oh yeah they will certainly listen
---
They should have fixed it at a size where a cargo fit rorqual/Orca or JF could get it though, going 400k m2 is overkill.
---
I'm okay with this
---
Open the game and play it.
---
So despite the removal of blackout halfway through the month, the recovery of ratting bounties was only to half of the pre-blackout values. The cyno changes are likely the cause of this.
---
The screenshot is filled with cats, that might be seen on a stargate. The cats are happy and joyful.
---
This comment reinforces my point.
---
I don't disagree as long as CCP adjusts the mechanics to give some safety without perfect intel and tweak up the rewards.
---
Audio cues are a lot harder to miss, which is why the most critical warning always have audio cues for everything.
---
How does a cloaked hic help lol?
---
When the sotiyo cargo drops, it drops with the same radius as the sotiyo was originally, meaning it can be grabbed from an absolutely huge area. The only realistic counter requires a lot of bodies using drones to try to decloak ninjas before the sotiyo pops to give your guy the longest amount of time to try.
---
u started shooting each other?heheheee
---
wtf stop making me agree with you. But I do do worry that making people out in space less PvEing will result in a net loss of PvP, because the only way to force content at this point is ganking ratters hoping for escalation, and painfully boring structure fights.
---
It gets to the point that adding another account cuts in to your income that much you may as well not rat and be better off for it.
---
I know that's one of the reasons I don't super rat. The amount of hours of have to spend ratting to afford a fax and cyno alt to go with it excede the amount of time I actually have to spend doing the activity to start with.
---
That seems unfair, but why are you faster?
---
&gt;The change occuring gives so much power to people just wanting to grief, and doesn't really change anything but exactly that.
---
But you would at least be seen as the "griefer" here, right?
---
"toxic for the community".... translates to what exactly?  because usually this is just the placeholder people use when they've been group thinked into hating someone but arent really sure why they hate them
---
Nothing Near2 does can't be accomplished by having the intel channel open on your screen and reading it while ratting.
---
The real power is the layout of systems in EVE, with some systems forming pockets that can only be entered via 1-2 systems or a wh if you are not living there. If there was a way to travel between star sytems without cyno or gates, Near2 would require scouts in a lot more systems.
---
with much more cost amirim?
---
Sure, one method of notification may be superior to another but the way that  notification is triggered isn't anything the game client doesn't already have the functionality to do for you if you bother to set it up.
---
Because Eve doesn't already have an issue with using tons of memory.
---
Nice to see they remove all the accounts associated with 1 bot
---
i know who you are. provi is cancer for small gangs now because they subscribe to the dunk dinkle get the fuck out way of life now, and larger fleets are met with stratop-like defenses
---
all good tho, we all need our sandcastles and provi is building theirs.
---
The bots that I found that accepted fleet invites and then *undocked to try and drop fleet* were pretty easy to catch :D
---
But obviously that's an exception.
---
he said on reddit, replying to a picture of a comment posted  on twitter
---
I think Eagles are preferred these days.
---
OOF that Detorid evacuation  
---
Why is there not a corresponding data point on the imports?
---
Loooootta caps, everything was seeded and SiSi prices so everyone just went nuts
---
Sure, as soon as r/eve is against the EULA
---
The rage, while obnoxious and really funny in hind sight, was fueled by something EVE has been missing for a long time. Passion. There is no reason time based objectives anymore, there is largely nothing goal wise you can shoot for that can't be shortcut or cheated for.
---
You don't have to write to a buffer. The logs are all saved server side already. Should be pretty easy to get all logs from start of play to end of play from the server.
---
Only if the notification sound is the "target killed" sound and you are not allowed to mute it.
---
The Police skin is beautiful.
---
dude absolutely.
---
I tried near2 out of necessity today and HOLY SHIT handholding
---
Thanks, appreciate it. Starting from scratch on the missile skills, but corp I just joined was wardeced so looks like I have some station time to get them sorted.
---
Bro nice flair.
---
My problem with NEAR2 is that it’s very easy to setup bots to read the system local list and report.
---
Second, that you don’t even need to be undocked to report someone jumping into your system. So I could be watching Netflix and just report names all day, how is that engaging?
---
onyl way would be to put a gate into each anomoly..... buffing standard ratting WAAAAAAY too much
---
And? Wormholes make crazy isk but whine nullsec makes to much isk. During blackout wormholes were safer and more profitable than nullsec. Why should anyone listen to them when they are hypocrites about it?
---
When your four points don't make the cut
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78566479/
---
Doesn't that still require player input however, while Near2 does not?
---
up
---
So it's roughly the same time investment to keep the accounts active, and one is considerably less up front cost, and more afkable.
---
It would be nice, if you could have the possibility to set access to corps/alliances and for the most important part dissalow access, if a member of that certain corporation/alliance has left said corporation/ alliance. We already have these problem in in game mailing list, where you have to manually kick people that left
---
Your right, but for the person like me who can't play constantly, and likes exploring when possible, I much prefer being able to stay in omega but extracting sp gained during omega time whilst still being able to get enough isk from explo left over to infi plex at 4hrs of work a month roughly.
---
Yes GONG please!
---
Чё бля?
---
BOOOOONGGGGG

Altrue, the guy who made this, won eve last year

The wormholers who cry about this are the people who rat in C3s or run C5 sites out of their home static in groups. C3 sites make 40mil each and take around 15-20 minutes, putting them a little lower than carrier ratting. C5 sites are ~500mil each and can take a group of players over 30 minutes to run without the help of a cap (since static site running doesn't allow you to use the broken citadel mechanic to kill the drifter).
---
Wormholers complaining about high-level nullsec PvE are usually comparing it to their low-investment low-SP PvE. Instead of realising that their own risk-averseness is the issue, they will instead point the finger at null groups with better infrastructure than their 30-man C4 corp and cry to CCP about how unfair it is that their poor little casual corp doesn't print isk at the same rate.
---
isnt this really a corp chat/comms question?

---
Do you call init though? I recall a certain fort timer last weekend where suddenly 130 man init blob appeared mysteriously.
---
I would love to throw in text but the video editing software I use isn't good with posting text, unless I just suck with it? I dunno. I'm using the free version of VegasPro so that might be it.
---
Every time I try, it kind of only lets me do a blank screen with text or I can do a caption overlay that doesn't change through the whole video. 
---
I might do a solo audio clip that I can put in as narration...
---
&gt; And what is the viable counter to it?
---
1. A better method (ask Baltrom &amp; Co. They figured it out in a couple hours on SISI.
---
2. Watch the stream with ashterothi, I went into details explaining the different methods they could use.
---
&gt;Maybe, but it seems like a problem
---
Its only a problem for them cause stopping me would require a bit of effort from them which is clearly not reasonable.
---
I like this. It's some pretty common sense, surface level stuff but meaningful. I would like to see ideas like this expanded upon and seriously considered by CSM and CCP.
---
The source data for Near2 is someone typing things into an intel channel.
---
I've seen some solo LSC fittings with dual web vs a web &amp; warp scrambler.
---
Could someone explain this? Couldn't they just warp off without the warp scrambler?
---
*cries in small independent alliance*
---
CSM knows, CCP doesn't care.
---
have you seen the bill gates miniseries? its amazing!
---
&gt; I think just because you have personally benefitted from the mechanic you are failing to realise how dog shit it is.
---
Because I've both run and stolen sotiyos (almost evenly distributed) I have insights on how to counter myself with ease, and somehow the combined brainpower the major coalitions are unable to come to the same conclusion.
---
Its a fair mechanic whoever puts more effort in wins.
---
Ah, copy.  Thought it automatically read the local list and notified if a neut appeared
---
lmao thinking i'm playing eve still 😂
---
It does that too.
---
I posted that already? Is my link broken or something?
---
Yeah it's an fc problem they have.  For some reason a couple cruisers are responded to with almost always with muninns or cerbs or jackdaws rather than normal skirmish ships. This is largely why they have a roaming haw dread issue nowadays btw.
---
i appreciate the mittani \[pbuh\] for winning eve and everyone hating cuz their corp/alliance is losing eve
---
You make me laugh. You should buy me a drink big boy.
---
That 18% drop in trade from August, which was already down 18% from July :O
---
&gt; Balancing:
---
Adjusted volume of Pirate Shipyard caches.
---
That's the whole list of balance changes in a game that suffers horrifically from a lack of balance changes, absolutely fucking disgusting from a consumer point of view.
---
No, just enemies who act like adults aged 25+
---
If you want a game attractive to the manchild demographic go play runescape or league
---
It's just not the same, you can't force a fight with a bubble wrap anymore and there's no limit to citadels unlike moons for POS.
---
The features of the citadels are nice, the mechanics: not so much.
---
If only there was a way to force people to undock like entosising their station services
---
I could be docked up all day waiting for pings. How is that engaging?
---
Discord is plagued with relays despite "modified clients" being against the EULA so making something against the EULA doesn't stop Eve players anyway.
---
On the contrary, I'm trolling a group of manchildren and having a good time doing it
---
By all means continue with your asskissing
---
Uwat m8?
---
He wasn't leader of waffles. Also, we jumped from being guerilla warfare, to trying sov and hating it, to back to guerilla warfare.
---
&gt;Wormholes always had the risk
---
But apparently they are extremely safe.
---
tf is that fit
---
.....how
---
You're getting closer.  But the isk faucet isn't changing like it did with nullsec.  So we can hypothesize that your average nullbear docked up or logged out while your average wormholer, btw did not.  That tells me your average wormholer, btw is less risk averse than the average F1 monkey.  Prove me wrong.
---
The bookmark appears immediately in space and the dropdown for the creator but  no one else.  For everyone else, it appears immediately in the people and places folder (refresh required) but is greyed out and says it is too new to use.  Once the two minutes is up they appear in space and in the dropdown.  The creator can initiate fleetwarps to fresh bookmarks before the 2 minute timer is up.
---
Thank you for your response and you do get your opinion accross fairly well, I do disagree on several of the points so lets take em one by one.
---
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/pU8eJMs.png
---
This is a thing I've heard of from others but have never encountered myself ever. I was looking into it with a friend who was experiencing it, and we summized that it was cause by instability of the connection of the player experiencing it however this is not confirmed and not collaborated.
---
&gt;However you always seem to 1) decloak before anyone else 2) loot the wreck almost instantly after decloaking
---
As to decloaking before anyone else that has to do with my experience, and knowledge of how it looks when a sotiyo hits 0% hull and is at the brink of dying.
---
The looting is never instant it seems that way since I as you say decloak before everyone else and therefore have an advantage by simply cutting away command time between my client and the server. I won't explain my actual method of looting untill CCP implements the change since that would be counter productive for myself. This part of looting is also what I've refered to on multiple streams as runners advantage.
---
&gt;I think your argument that there are easy counters to ninja looters is bullshit. You of course are talking about probing down the DSTs as they land on grid to cloak. I've seen you kill plenty of DSTs this way but you and I both know that this "easy" way to defend against DSTs is bullshit.
---
You are contradicting yourself quite severely here, you say you've seen me do it, but its bullshit is not an amazing argument.
---
I do agree the downtime login thing is dumb and broken, but that has nothing to do with the looting mechanics, that has to do with DT login mechanics.
---
&gt;Another reason this is bullshit is that as someone who is USTZ and can really only run these sotiyos around 9pm Eastern Time. I think its completely unreasonable that you expect me to sit in game with several sabres and probers for like 15 hours from DT to say 0100. Even though someone could easily login at DT and cloak before anyone is able to launch probes and scan them down.
---
I have personally done exactly that on numerous occations, and I don't think its unreasonable at all. If you are any number above 2 people this is not that major of a task. Simply split of the time between you to ensure proper coverage with well rested members (the more the better).
---
&gt;Therefor there really is no counter to stopping a DST from getting on grid.
---
You've missed quite a few "counters" like camping the actual system to avoid people even entering system to get into position.
---
You've also failed to include runners advantage which I mentioned above.
---
**Endnote**
---
Don't get me wrong, I can definetly understand your concerns and although being somewhat rude false accusations, and sotiyos could definetly use some changes, I just don't think THIS change is good for it but in lack of a better suggestion all I can do is say my peace which is that I think its a bad one, and use the arguments I have at hand to support it.
---
idk if you're serious or not
---
Features &amp; Changes
---
Balancing:
---
Adjusted volume of Pirate Shipyard caches
---
sigh
---
My bad. Meant to type low sec. So are you saying you wouldn't ever use two dual webs in normal 1v1 pvp? You'd always want the warp scram?
---
Agreed.  I'd be 100% in favor of some kind of limit on citadels per system, hole, or whatever.
---
Warp Core Stabs are okay for moving and hauling purposes especially for newer guys. Thats ok. However there should be way harsher debuffs making them unusable in pve/pvp e.g. reducing all outgoing damae to 0 or something like that.
---
I'm happy I found a corp that I liked and called home only for RK to join the donut and grab the keys to their space steamroller device
---
The MAC of what ? of the network card ?
---
This MAC can be changed in a VM.
---
This MAC can also be changed in some network cards.
---
And what if you have several network cards ? eg ethernet and wifi. And what if you wifi card uses several chipset for several protocoles ? eg 802.11 g and 802.11b .
---
Really? When I looked at it a bit I couldn't spot anything that suggested it did that. This was a while ago though.
---
Came in for dank "you dropped on the wrong ratter, amigo" and found "I killed a disabled person"
---
So, based on the related kills ... 
---
Looks like the tengu dropped a sin on a merlin, then got rofl stomped by a VNI and cynabal?
---
Good kills for you
---
Sin pilot should retire
---
Not sure about the sarcasm there, but Sreegs was arguably useless. At least CCP are trying these days.
---
Data is skewed because only people who have the skill, initial capital and dedication to set up a farm hole go to wormholes.
---
You can't throw a week old newbro in a vni into a wormhole and expect him to make money and the guys farming know how to keep themselves safe.
---
Why would a bot maker make it run 24/7 ? Make it run 5/6 and it's good.
---
&gt; Prove me wrong.
---
Why would wormholers change their PvE behavior when blackout didn't affect their space? What kind of logic are you even operating on?
---
So I should just provide you with secrets and information because you're too lazy / don't have time to do research yourself?
---
Sounds like a great way to make an informed decision. :shrug:
---
I think we are agreeing, I am saying wormholes are both more profitable and safer than nullsec. But wormholers will never admit this and rather cry about nullsec making to much isk.
---
Sad part is they actually could've been onto something. Everyone was finally getting settled into blackout, now that its back with no further changes, everything just feels bland and pointless
---
Arguably it is too safe because of the mechanics. This was talked about in the notes I think. So nerfs need to happen.
---
Don’t try and beat them heads up
---
Don’t try and kill the line members to “hurt their income” unless you want to beat them heads up by going after their supers and rorqs nonstop (good luck lol)
---
Go for what hurts.  Don’t become a director (lazy solution anyways).  Make their lives harder.  They will dismantle themselves and take the fun from their own members faster than you can believe if you make it unfun for the directors
---
Because that data is available in the dataset, not the graph. The dataset RAR that's released in the august MER showed 7.5% of all ships are destroyed in wormholes. I haven't had time to analyze the September one yet.
---
Yeah cynable fired a few rounds to whore on sin and helped me kill the tengu which was repping like a boss.
---
Sosni xyitca!
---
Broken, or something you don't like? I know eve players now are do fucking entitled they think it's the same thing, but it's not.
---
Hear me:
---
EVE is dying, only this time for real
---
The data dump includes a full list of all ship loses for the month.
---
Boo-fucking-hoo, subcap ratters aren't a problem and don't need to be nerfed. Bots warp as soon as you enter local and you can't catch them anyway. Capital ratters are the ones that need to be hunted. 
---
People who have been playing for less than a year and who are trying to make isk by subcap ratting so they can buy pvp ships are not your source of content. Go fight someone who wants to fight you, coward.
---
This was a shit mechanic and you are shit.  Stop bitching.  Literally this was one of the worst mechanics in the game.  No one thought you were cheating, they just thought this was incredibly lame, even if it wasn't you getting the loot.  It's now a more engaging mechanic.
---
&gt; SAD!
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/484031532
---
There you go now to look &amp; learn.
---
Then he was wasting his time. The real detection is done entirely on the server. If it gets to the point where the activity produced as a result of a bot is truly indistinguishable from a normal baseline player, they will not be caught. But then they also will not be running 24/7.
---
Nah
---
Must have been hard to put in an app to get into the biggest blob. You've done so much..
---
What was necessary about it
---
I had to look just to make sure you weren't trolling. I wish you were. This sucks.
---
An Ishtar makes 3b/h?
---
THE NECK PROTECTS
---
Boom roasted
---
2 regions is being very generous.
---
You assume that everyone ratting is fully PvE fit, eh?
---
Baiting in anoms is a great way to catch someone roaming off-guard.
---
Being risk adverse is one thing, but to finally catch one of those instawarp upon system entry ishtars just to have it warp out due to stabs can be a bit frustrating.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d1qjmj/updated_numbers_what_effect_is_the_blackout/ezqi8q9/
---
I think they talked about the holes not respawning unless something was done. So for a certain number of hours, nothing could get in without it showing up as a new sig or something.
---
Nothing aside from.. Idk.. Not writing chat to a log file in your hard drive. (pretty sure they could lock access to the file while in use) meaning you would have to break the eula to make it work
---
Idk wether sadface or omegalul
---
Something something shooting the messenger.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Might not be a bad idea though for Integretas to merge into RK. There aren't any faction police in Delve.
---
I put cynos on my Dominixes and killed a hot dropping carrier with my hel. Fuck ya black out!
---
Then they took cynos away. 
---
The they took black out away. 
---
Then I...dunno. Went back to rorqual mining I guess. I really haven’t been on much.
---
They finally fixed the grey and black screen when jumping to a system, thank god. It was annoying specially when it happened in systems with fights ongoing
---
Only the lowest hanging fruit bots would run 24x7
---
All CCP had to do to not make people quit in droves during blackout was to buff the rewards to compensate for the risk. How none of them though about this is stunning.
---
Help us, Trump
---
Almost three hours. No thanks. Give me a timestamp.

Wut is this "SA" you speak of? Is it some new mining ship?

Sounds about right lol

Just like anybody else with an iq over 60, I would imagine

You want something, go get it yourself. Jeez

what did the wormholers break this time ? :-)
---
I volunteer as tribute
---
Yeah k162 wormholes would not be visible on probe scanner for 4 hours unless someone warped to it from the other side. I agree that should be changed.
---
But it's just a bandaid fix for nothing since wormhole playstyle is already almost dead.

you entertain me

He gave me exactly what I told him I couldn't do. Don't expect a different result.

You sort of have to know the history to get my post mate..
---
Unfortunately there's no way to do short term damage to a region you're moving through.
---
Unlike Vikings who could pillage and plunder, modern Eve just allows you to lock your door and close the curtains as an effective defence against anyone you don't wish to fight.
---
There's nothing at risk with timezone tanks, and invulnerability periods, and damage caps.
---
How many fights escalated from a few dreads being dropped on a small POS when they fail to single cycle it and get stuck and have to call in something else to save them dying to the fast response fleets?
---
Noone bothers any more because there are so few times you can even do that.
---
If you're bored and want to shoot something, you have to hope that the structure is vulnerable otherwise you're shit out of luck. And good luck getting a fight out of it. See you at the final timer.
---
Then the program would just read the memory for it, they could.. Stop using plain text for logs until it caches put to the disk upon exit that would work. No more grep for the log files while still being able to access them plain text post playing
---
You gone continue whining? Should pick up some diapers
---
Done for! You might get angry looks or worse, being directly confronted in conversation for your shitty views. Clearly, this is the authoritarian nightmare that is socialism.
---
It generates 12t isk apparently. This should be a priority and nerfed yesterday.
---
Tbh he was a dick but people like him are what eve is missing too. Be interesting if they could actually reform -A-
---
Sure, but they were things that had large impacts.
---
The Blood Harvest has been a yearly staple of this time period.
---
So uhh CCP, i sorta had 3.25million plex's in my MTU when I scooped it. They went poof. Can I have them back?
---
Continue kissing Garth's ass
---
&gt;93% chance of success. That's hilariously high for any endeavor in Eve.
---
If only 1 in 10 havens ran resulted in a dead super, or if 7% of spod rocks warped away before you could mine them.
---
&gt; This change occurred at the behest of CSM member Vily, who brought it up at the summit as a change to be made due to him (and his alliance/coalition) thinking it a unreasonable and unfair mechanic.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; From information gathered, the other CSM members within the conversation regarding this “issue” either didn’t have a view on the idea or were not finding any reason to defend the ninja looting aspect of the debate.
---
I won't comment on whether you're right about what happened in the room. I just want to say even if you were right, none of the other CSMs speaking against the change would say volumes about the activity. The meetings are not places which the idea X gets defended by 7 separate CSMs who are behind the idea. Usually, someone brings a problem up, and if others don't disagree or dissent then it means they agree. Thus assuming what you say is true, and he brought it up and nobody objected, then it means all 10 CSMs were behind the change. And I must tell you we don't often have that much consensus on anything.
---
And in this case, I agree with the change. You see, being a thief of 2 trillion worth of Excavators and all, I am all for niche anti mega empire playstyles. Particularly ones that steal from them. But to judge the thievery, I also have to care about whether it's fair, balanced, and it requires a good mastery to be worthy of the reward you're getting. So it's particularly helpful here to compare your activity with mine.  
---
You see, my booshing didn't take "4 hours straight of testing and playing". It took innovation in many fields; from how you can use multiple accounts in a single monitor, to how you can manage a 10 man booshing fleet, to how you can extract drones from hostile space, to making novel cd fits that were optimized for drone booshing, to figuring out who's hostile in delve and how to avoid them completely wiping my fleet. It also took hundreds of billions of investment, 63 command destroyer characters, tons of replacement ships, and so on. 
---
Even after hearing your case, so much airtime on TIS, or how defenders have "home field advantage" and so on, I am not convinced whether your skillset deserves the reward particularly in the form of stolen goods/man hours from the other side. I think anyone can slip in a DST in a system and wait for someone else to run a site. And the fact that it's scriptable also matters; not whether you're scripting or not. The bottom line is that "fastest looter in the west" doesn't sound like something impressive to me, so that's why I didn't raise a dissenting opinion.
---
I know exactly why null empires are overrepresented in CSM. I ran my very campaign on that premise. But it has nothing to do with single members lobbying their interests into the game and CCP falling for the trick. My impression is also that they are very open to the idea of how null civilization/empires were overly stressed in last few years of game development. And how alternative playstyles, nomads, explorers, aggressive people, thieves, etc, fell off the meta. But you're using the negative anti-CSM sentiments in the community emerging from this fact to your own benefit, either as revenge for the frustration of losing your income source or in the hopes of getting the change reversed. Either way, if you think your activity was fair, balanced, and deserved the reward; you're wrong.
---
Again, I'm all for defending alternative, anti-empire, asymmetric playstyles. But to me the playstyle also needs to be worthy of defending to begin with.
---
Either research or plugging another alt in your alliance, my guess.
---
why anyone would listen to ron is beyond me. that guy is incredible stupid in regards to gamemechanics in general.
---
the amount of false information he gives out to newer players on his stream couldnt get higher.
---
Using a Carrier to move you solo stuff from one lowsec region to another. (WTB jump freighter for fitted ships)
---
It's Chaos Age, so the changes will be deployed in a series of 48 hour notices through in-character RP news releases, like they did for blackout.
---
Yeah I realize reading through these comments that even legit names thought he might be cheating.  Idk whether he was, probably not, but I don't need to assume he was cheating to defend this change.  The mechanic was dumb regardless of which DST looted the wreck.  It takes little school to get a DST on grid and a ridiculous amount of effort to counter it (paying super attention for hours and hours just waiting to probe, better have a piss bucket).  That's never a good balance.
---
Also I definitely had leave to away from game :)
---
It doesn't.  It would already be against the eula if it did
---
That top their reductionist reasoning 👌
---
Yea, was slowing down when they announced blackout. Was waiting to see where they went with the "Chaos". They backpedaled and I unsubbed everything. Waiting for Vegas, and if its this trash for mentioning future balance I'm gonna pull a Grath and just uninstall D:
---
I liked It a lot when I looted sotiyo without having to bash them, but having at the very least the same chance to loot as the people killing It with very few effort involved (scout sotiyo, probe it, cloak dst on it) Is just absurdly unbalanced
---
Encrypt the logs? Encryption keys change every server restart.
---
Um.... If you are talking about that kid get shot, well, you don't "protest" by wearing gask mask, full body armor and armed with shield and baton crowd beating a cop. Oh and btw if you do this here in US, you should feel lucky if you get less than a dozen bullets in your skull.
---
&gt; You are contradicting yourself quite severely here, you say you've seen me do it, but its bullshit is not an amazing argument.
---
What I mean by this is that you say there are easy ways to counter DSTs. However whenever a sotiyo pops up on zkill, I go scan it down and get one of my DST alts into system and logged off in position. I've also seen you do this a multitude of times. Therefore whenever the sotiyo is reinforced all you have to do is just login right after DT. Bypassing any gate camps or other methods to kill DSTs. The only other way I can think of to kill dsts is to decloak them with a fuck ton of drones orbiting the sotiyo or back in the day when supers used to cheese them and fighters decloaked them while orbiting. But that is easily countered by staying 20km off the sotiyo cloaked and then boating in to ~2,050 when it nears destruction. So there is no way to easily kill dsts like you claim. unless the people piloting the dsts are dumb.
---
Runners advantage:
---
Yes the runners advantage exists. All one has to do is control whenever the sotiyo dies, decloak their own DST and loot before all the others decloak since you control when it dies. It does make things easier.
---
However, take for example this sotiyo https://zkillboard.com/kill/74634075/
---
We ran it in supers and were able to control when it died. We warped down ready to loot but when it died, for a solid 3 freaking seconds the wreck did not appear on any of our overviews or game clients. at all. by that point you had already decloaked and looted the faction modules.
---
The same thing happened here as well
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73351014/
---
You can call me dumb or something for not "figuring out the correct way to loot" or some shit
---
But when the game doesn't even load the wreck for a solid 3-4 seconds? What do you do then.
---
&gt;Complain until a mechanic is changed
---
&gt;Tell somebody else to adapt or die
---
You really are quite dense aren't you?
---
An actually well implemented ESS would be fun
---
No shield slaves.
---
Your mistake was being partisan in your target choice, you gotta ignore your bias and stay on target to hit the bullseye.
---
I don't disagree with you, CCP has historically taken the position of not consulting the people who are the apex of the change requested, and as a result, usually swing the safety switch way too far as a result.   
---
You can see this is change to ninja salvaging, freighter bumping, fatigue, etc. It's a pattern that's been with CCP since I can remember.
---
Oh, barf. Don't give anything back to those rock-sucking, bot-aspirant leeches. Most of them stopped being humans a long time ago. They'll take it for granted and never lift a finger to help.
---
Those applications are so unnecessary. Just fit a scram and fight people if they tackle your ratter. [Sometimes you win](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78970358/), sometimes [you get shitstomped](https://zkillboard.com/kill/79172471/).
---
Yep.  One problem with Eve right now is that it's a solved problem.
---
Something about new triglavian structures?
---
People used them for standings?
---
Nope, I can see both fits working. 
---
Just look at it this way: if the enemy doesn't have a MWD, your  scram is an empty module slot that eats capacitor. The point is basically a cap drain anyway. 
---
They enable you to get the kill mail, but aren't actually helping you get there. It all depends on what you want to do.
---
Maybe you just want to fight and fly and maximize your survivability while learning, idk.
---
August+September WERE quite busy to be fair. It is good to take a cycle for bug fixing. We will see what next month brings, I would suspect bigger things for November or December.
---
Can I get details please?
---
Because Eve is a game of plays and counter plays. Removing WCS would tip the balance i this aspect one way.
---
I don't think the ISK generation is the sole problem, it's that compounded with the fact that comparatively little is dying in wormholes.
---
12T is low compared to 2012 but at the same time a lot of shit was dying back then too.
---
Literally just port vanguard incursion sites over to null. That's it. Vanguard incursion sites are perfect for an alliance to run.
---
As a person in a C4 corp can confirm that people rat in our static, with the other static open and do occasionally get caught as a result. People running static sites in subs, especially in groups of mixed skills, will not usually make more than 200 mil per hour of active time per character (ignoring time taken to roll for a hole with sites and close existing connections in there).
---
you can't expect nullbabs to have the same wrinkles as ls meth addicts and therabois it seems
---
Whatever they announce at vegas will honestly probably make or break the game at this point. 
---
If it's just new trig dreads that can melt subs at 80km with perfect tracking and no changes to address citadels / resource distribution...
---
Nice goon flair lol
---
Balance: fixed a bug that made PVE interesting
---
Thats effort though, using the right tags and pings and whatever. Its already hard to get members to give useful intel :D
---
Im against near, either you can manage to pay attention or you deserve to be killed. If you sleep you die, its how the game (should) work.
---
That's 2 different things. Also the guy was 16.
---
The organ harvesting been happening to the 1 million muslims.
---
The guy was shot after trying to defend himself during one of the protests.
---
Shitter
---
No just until hilmar gets his bonus check!!
---
It’s both.
---
I have issue calling it a QOL change. you dont care about the qol of the guy with the stabs, you just want your game to be easier without even considering the other side. 
---
Dont get me wrong tho stabs are shit. Just try and see it through the other guys perspective before you cry for nerfs.
---
- Learning how to fly ships because you were limited by time and sp so you couldn't just get an alpha VNI to make isk to inject to a bigger ratting ship to inject a main with whatever you felt like that week.
---
- The Character Bazaar traders
---
I agree, it was the first time I felt scared in the game with the exception of trying to get out of an occupied hole. Boredom is back on the menu.
---
Probably the point is there are people who just want to make space money and who are risk averse.
---
Are we ready to admit "piracy" was barely a thing when it was a thing, and is now what average lowsec PvP based corps call themselves to feel less retarded?
---
No, not even close. Destiny, to be frank, isn't an MMO in any meaningful sense. 
---
The planetside series is really the only thing that comes to mind as counting. There have been a couple of other odd ball games too, and knockoffs like Welkin, but if you can't get 250 or so people in the same location to shoot each other, it's not an MMOFPS.
---
Plz stop kinkshaming yodik
---
Yeah you missed it for sure.
---
Chinese botters log off, rmt goes down ,trash leaves. I don’t see a downside.
---
What's more engaging about bringing a blob and a freighter? Changing it from favouring one group of people to favouring another group of people isn't in the game's interest, it's in a specific player group's interest, which just so happens to be the same group that voiced the need for the change.
---
Nice mental gymnastics though but you failed to stick the landing.
---
i mean... that's exactly what it does.
---
&gt; with better infrastructure
---
Does local count as infrastructure?
---
Thanks, you can also see this in action live in PGL's replies.
---
I think Hilmar wanted to pull that stuff off, but I feel like Pearl Abyss shut him down hard once some numbers were dropping. He was all over talking about big changes. Then suddenly blackout is reversed and he hasnt said a thing since. They probably threatened his paycheck lol
---
Blaming the community is counterproductive. CCP have cut staffing to the bone and the skeleton crew of devs are running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to keep things running. 
---
These guys don't have the time or the talent to implement changes properly, especially since upper management has lately been frantically twisting the dials (a.k.a. "chaos era") as a CYA move so they can claim to have tried everything when they fail to qualify for the contingent cash portion of the PA buyout deal (and hopefully hang on to their jobs.)
---
CCP have lost any semblance of long-term planning and the customers have a right to object to being jerked around.
---
According to various sources 70%-80% of devs are working on the NPE, so no time to rehash the Blood Harvest.  I wouldn't be surprised at all that there would be little to nothing for the rest of the year including the Holidays in December.
---
yikes
---
Having listened to about 15 mins, I would say this should be nerfed. The "window" to counter your method is almost non-existent and quite frankly unresonable. This abuses the same thing as afk-cloaking.
---
It's also very suspicious that you are just "faster" than other players for no particular reason other than experience. What seems like a motte &amp; bailey claim regarding new and old players should be dismissed because this is a specific action that can presumably be learned quickly. Right now, a loot script best explains your "advantage".
---
NPE?
---
WCS should be removed period.  This would be hailed as a positive across New Eden.
---
If nothing is overheated and you are not being shot at structure then modules getting damaged is a bug.
---
lmao
---
Uh....no.  He was talking about how server responses get back to the client.  They get back via IP address in the header, not MAC address as he thought.
---
The server doesn't know you're using NAT.  It just sends back the response to your router's IP.
---
Why don’t you enlighten me ob big brain poster
---
Why didn’t anyone think of that
---
To stop crimes and terrorism just tell people not to do it
---
It’s brilliant!
---
New Player Experience
---
A lot of companies can be extremely imprecise on agile/scrum terminology. I've heard the word scrum used to describe the daily standup, the sprint, the kanban board, and I'm pretty sure other things too.
---
Only one observation post per gate so obviously the alliance that controls the space would come back and repair it or the attackers could destroy it the next day.
---
Since it's the client logging, not the server, the client would have private key anyway. Therefore nothing would be gained for the implementation effort.
---
The customer**s** are always right in the aggregate: you can't argue with popular demand. But on an individual basis the customer is frequently wrong.
---
he specifically says it's used to reach your client through the router.
---
The routing back is made through NAT, not through MAC
---
Uhh yeh there is, fit more warp scramblers or bring a dictor.
---
Oh yeah, almost certainly. The issue there is that, the ship required to run those sites is expensive for a newbro. If you lose a 4 mil isk scanning ship, no biggy. Losing a 50-100 mil isk BC hurts a lot more for the little guy just starting out.
---
I made my first billion isk going after wh gas, aside from the skillbook (30mil) it's the same as data/relic sites or better (20-40mil per hour, 4mil for the ship to do it) but the sites are much easier to find in my experience. 
---
It's easier to get newbies to risk a cheap frigate they can get good skill to fly, simple as that.
---
In your defense one of the strongest arguments that you are not scripting or macro'ing is that you still try to kill other dsts who are trying to loot
---
Which makes sense to me, but I still haven't made up my mind. The "too far away" thing is just such a big blocker to looting, and you don't experience it? idk man
---
&gt; My problem with NEAR2 is that it’s very easy to setup bots to read the system local list and report.
---
That's not a problem with NEAR2, that's a problem with local and/or botting in general.
---
I doubt anyone is actually using NEAR2 in that way because once you're in, "Fuckit, I'ma bot this" territory it makes a lot more sense to use an external channel to communicate intel instead of the duct-tape+bubblegum kludge of using ingame chat channels.
---
reminder: keepstar lock (and thus DD) range was buffed by a single csm member requesting it who also happened to be defending multiple keepstars at the time of the change
---
the group who actively killed keepstars at the time was ignored completely (no csm) and the change was snuck in
---
step 1 to fixing this shit game is disband this glorified lobbyist group
---
It’s a counter to scrubs that prey on carebears and it gimps your fit it should not be removed.
---
Yep, and the siphon mechanic in another form would be good (even if it's not moon goo, but something that allows you to attack infrastructure and isk making). The problem as ever is perfect API information.
---
The prevalence of APIs for vulnerability, moon cracking, etc etc is causing there to be no unknowns. It's a shame.
---
Bingo it’s a trade off
---
Nullsec has local, wormholers have the probe window. The only advantage null has is that they can see when someone has their system seeded. And who the fuck seeds rattlesnake bearholes? It's not worth it.
---
as pointed out in the csm mins, the lack of direction/vision is putting people off. i know the fact that there has been nothing announced/to look forward to has kinda made me wonder why i should keep my last omega subbed other than to keep accumulating skill points i don't seem to have a reason to keep accumulating...
---
there's nothing really going on in eve, and nothing has been announced that might make things happen. it's a problem.
---
Sounds a real winner.
---
Thats why t2 frig pricing is tanking
---
anyone whos ever dealt with either you or ccp knows this is horseshit
---
are you looking to run for csm soon again or something? why the PR stunt [read: mass of lies] thread
---
oh i see it threatens your actual real life income that you live on from sotiyo ninja-ing that you've bragged about multiple times
---
my bad carry on
---
That's what I don't get, they decided to do blackout/chaos when they have *the least* amount of dev time because it was over summer.  It pretty much was setup to be the lowest effort thing possible for a very impactful change.
---
Indeed, while player induced stagnation is an issue, a double whammy of CCP stagnating is not going to help things at all.
---
The game is already has high reward with low risk. I would increase the price of sov exponentially as the area grows, then I would force more fights by making resource migrate as they're drained.
---
Your drones don't care whether your ship has a WCS fitted regarding lock. And you can easily fit one on all ratting ships except the Gila without any meaningful drop in income.
---
Stop pretending like it's a major trade off. Fucking krabs.
---
I think it’s unfair to pin it to one person and also having such hi success rate seems broken. If your success rate as good pilot is perhaps 25-30% than maybe the change was not necessary but you are close to 100 which means its almost impossible to counter. I don’t really support their decision too who is going to bring a fat hauler far away from home to get the BPC it does not make sense
---
If you're AFK and using Near2, you'll die exactly the same as if you were AFK and not using it.  It doesn't input anything into the game - that's \*already\* against the EULA.
---
A huge part of said problem is the “hates new things” attitude that you and many players like you have. 
---
Example: 
---
CCP just chopped their own balls off with the blackout because they caved to your demands, like they do regularly. However this time it was a much more public display.
---
Further, your entire way of life, everything that you and your cronies stand for promotes stagnation. You want to sit in one spot and collect internet points, because that’s all isk and minerals really are, is internet points. If CCP is going to do ANYTHING that harms your ability to collect more points, you will throw a fit and demand they give your points back. Any meaningful changes are going to reduce your ability to safely collect points.
---
On the same side of the fence, you’re claiming that they cannot make any meaningful changes and the game is becoming boring.
---
Take a look in the mirror Dave. Eve is boring because you like boring.
---
Exactly, this should be higher up.
---
Fit more disrupters.
---
I too can generate fake numbers about banned bots
---
Yeah, one thing entirely (and conveniently) ignored in this stupid debate is the fact that gankers have perfect intel on who is ratting where, and access to cynos.
---
I mean, considering how many people were bitching here about it and wanted it gone, and calling it "the death of Eve" it's hard to fathom why they would pull it.
---
Booohooo chaos era 
---
&gt;Balancing:
---
&gt;Adjusted volume of Pirate Shipyard caches.
---
(that won't makes me resub btw)
---
Haha so true actually
---
But the narrative, how can people reee test if they can't lie about it.
---
Wouldn't work at all.
---
1)  CCP stops logs.
---
2) Near2 starts using IRC, Discord, Slack or all the above for intel.  People pin those channels always-on-top of the game and use them instead of in-game channels.
---
3) Now, not only has CCP done nothing - but they can no longer peek at the intel channels for bots.
---
Don't need Constellation specific channels. Literally a single channel and have Near2 read the corresponding channel.
---
Should I do one and end it once and for all?
---
You mean what's more engaging, bringing a freighter on grid and having to defend it as it loots, or watching 6 DSTs all decloak and warp away the moment a Sotiyo?
---
It's so obvious which one might actually lead to fun content that it's getting hard to take you seriously.  Stop showing off your butthurt and your bias all at the same time.
---
You talking about the Dominix? He calculated 35 hours **per account**, or 105 hours for 3 accounts, vs 30 for a super.
---
i wanna watch that next, been hearing good things about it. i generally dont binge and watch like maybe 2 episodes a day, so it may take a while to catch up :p
---
I do love the family fiends.
---
"CSM doesn't do anything and does not have any influence"
---
"1 CSM member can influence ccp to make a change"
---
Choose 1
---
It would take thousands of hics to stop this.
---
&gt; A huge part of said problem is the “hates new things” attitude that you and many players like you have.
---
maybe if most of the new things weren't shit - people might not hate them.
---
just because ccp made something new doesn't automatically make it good, and it definitely doesn't mean we have to suck their dick about it.
---
Isn't that the Blizzard WoW team's in house designation for warlocks?
---
Wrong. You can be completely tabbed out playing WoW and watching Netflix and still make isk while getting off safe by using near. If you’re not actively in eve you should be at risk of dying. Near fills that gap. It’s an exploit
---
It's proof of nothing because he has no proof of it. People have been asking for this change before vily was on the csm.
---
Please present proof this change was made on the behest of vily and not something people have asked for for years
---
&gt;required no human interaction
---
Yeah. I recall that "no human interaction" part quite well. During one of the biggest conflagrations in Delve (during my time in 2003-2012) with 23/7 camps everywhere I had to refuel our moon mining towers and what was left of our bridge network. Using a Jump Freighter was mostly out of the question. So: CovOps with Covert-Cyno, Black Ops Sin for bridging 2-3 blockade running transports at a time. Refueling approximately 30 towers every few days, as the cloaky haulers couldn't fit that much in one go. 
---
Missed out on a lot of kills while my mates were having oodles of fun. \\o/
---
No it doesn’t. Does your ingame Intel channel ping you when there’s a Nuet near by? You have to be actively watching the intel channel to get any intel. Near let’s you be completely tabbed out of eve making isk and getting off safe. EXPLOIT
---
It's been a while, it would be a good read
---
I mean they just sold the company.  That's usually the end of the roadmap.  
---
Don't hold your breath.
---
frames encapsulate packets, frames converse via MAC address, packets via IP, NAT and RFC1918 address space are private, yes you must source-nat to talk to most internet sources but there are many legitimate cases to make exemptions.
---
Hope that helps.
---
So much crying.  Just figure out how to beat them.
---
This was used by very few people to rat effectively. I'm sorry but that change was not big enough to affect 99% of wh pve content.
---
neither am I 🤔
---
Your spin would work if you weren't in goons when it happened.  But at least it explains why you don't know the basics of your own history. Goons be goons.
---
neither am I 😛
---
So your problem isn't with NEAR2 then.
---
Reading memory however is something CCP can enforce their EULA on, manipulating/reading ram memory data is also easily tackled with anti-cheat software.
---
Even if you could ban VPN's (it would be a fruitless attempt)
---
There's many legitimate reasons to run VPN's.
---
I can actually confirm in this case, CCP is very quick to jump on 'public' VPN's, I got 3 of my accounts banned because I forgot to disconnect from a TOR VPN and had to find a backup-FC because it took them 3 days to unban me.
---
Terror? That is just their neighbors looking out for each other. He was just having trouble in life, he is in reeducation camp to become a good person again. Don't worry about it, everything is fine in China.
---
k, so while CCP breaks the game piece by piece people like you will sit idly by saying exactly that...
---
Suggestions from a 30-year veteran of meetings in a highly-regulated industry:
---
1.  Actions - clearly define "who", "what", and "by when"
---
2. Mechanism or tracking method to follow-up on actions to ensure that they are done "by when"
---
3. Recap at the end of the meeting, listing the actions and getting a verbal "I accept that action" by the responsible "who"
---
It doesn't that person is making shit up to sell a narrative of NEAR2 being bad. TEST doesn't even use NEAR2 it uses a home brew version of it and I can say for a fact it does not scan local lists. Just monitors chat logs.
---
yup that was my thought process too
---
CCP isnt changing anything in gameplay? Can it really be called a release?
---
No he was just under the tank checking for rust
---
I didn't go "reeee" I am pointing out the fact that, once again we are seeing a change that is catered to a very small portion of the player base, with very little thought going into what the overall ramifications of those changes are going to be for everyone else. 
---
You do know that not fellating CCP every time they make a change, and pointing out the parts of their changes that are bad, does not equate to 'reeee' right?
---
worst update ever.
---
People who dont like eve arent going to play eve no matter how polished the npe becomes.
---
Fix the shit that current customers are asking for and maybe just maybe eve will be able to retain newbies again.

Sure, though with enough depth to the change it could easily cater to both. PGL seems to think it'll introduce hunting them, knowing how the grid works post kill I disagree but it certainly COULD introduce this playstyle if the change was implemented differently. Is that the correct depth to 'solve' the problem for everyone involved? Difficult to say from an armchair without data.
---
lol. Gives no proof plus a long rant.
---
If it looks like a cheater, smells like a cheater, and loots like a cheater. I'd wager you're cheating.
---
I don't think they would bother inspecting packets. Would be easier to just read the applications memory, but your average developer probably doesn't have the skill set to do either of those things.
---
no, because any half decent group moderates their intel channels and will ban dipshits that do that from the channel.
---
intel channels are a privilige not a right.
---
Wow that is a good one! What a mess too try and track down everyone involved with that.
---
I've won Eve for years now, and I'm totally lost.  What is a sotiyo, and why are BPCs enormous now?  And how is ninja looting now a thing they're working to patch out?
---
No. It means that you'll be able to sit in those ships.
---
It's a subscription-based game like WoW. A couple of years ago, they added trial accounts which allow you to use the basic Tech I things in the game.
---
Awesome footage as always man :D
---
I do see their perspective... they got local back. I’m happy with removing WCS or local, but why should they get both?
---
CCP chopped their own balls by implementing a massively-impacting change without thinking about it.
---
You don't bring balance will random swing of the war axe, you bring balance by actually thinking what would balance the game.
---
Blackout isn't a bad change in the grand scheme of things, but only if it is balanced itself. Removing local completely from nullsec without any additionnal balance/QOL/whatever changes going along with it, and maybe, just maybe, communication about where you want to go ("chAOS eRA" is not communication, it is trollish bullshit saying "We don't know where it'll go, just doing it lol") with your changes and what will come along with it could have gone a long way reducing the player count loss we got with it. Change management is a real thing, and a real job.
---
Cynosural changes are another example of balance change they didn't think about :
---
\- Put cyno on paper T2 ships that have no place in Eve and remove it from every other ships, excepted for covert cynosural field because fuck you.
---
\- Make JF able to jump on covert cyno, then create a new module instead and fit it only to fucking industrial, complicating logistics drastically for non-bloc JF pilots and logistics corps for absolutely no fucking reason
---
\- Supercapitals fights are then impacted beyond words because fuck logic let's put cynos only on ships that cannot last more than 1 sec when on grid.
---
\- Did I say WHAT THE FUCK LEAVING COVERT CYNOS ALONE ? Don't get me wrong, they didn't touch me in forbidden places, just that it would have made sense to also reduce covert power if you're nerfing the other one, especially during blackout.
---
\- "Yes, sure, let's make them train all existing cyno alts into recons, way to make more money with skills injectors.... wait why are people unsubbing these alts, what are you doing, stoooop".
---
Is there people complaining CCP stole their toys and should give it back ? Sure, we saw some. Is it the global majority of people that complained? Absolutely not, not even close.
---
Let's see what happens if I prevent WH people to close holes (lol that would be retarded) or if removed alot of the safety of Highsec dwellers/newbeans... oh wait trig invasion in newbie systems.
---
The career agent missions give you free frigates.
---
There have been exploits found that allowed people to not be killed by concord when ganking.
---
And the infinite gun thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrYe_4vHzgE
---
You became the biggest group through excellent cohesion and planning from a small group of people. They guided the masses into making as much isk as they can as safely as they can. They saw what was effectively an emerging play style market and exploited it. Job very well done. Now however, anything that threatens that focused player group is like hitting their fattened chickens with a cattle prod. They’ll go elsewhere for that play style. In this example however, the chickens have a say in whether the farmer gets to eat or not, and they can just pack up and go to the farm (game) next door.
---
I dunno, i think I'd be kissing his ass because he is apparently the only person who has successfully gotten CCP to balance anything ...
---
Honestly i feel that is the core issue. 
---
They think to much, and do to little.
---
You should see his face when he was announcing the end of local blackout.
---
&gt; It will be **fun**
---
eh to be fair for most people provibloc is cva, not necessarily due to skill or numbers or whatever but cause well, legacy i guess
---
&gt;A huge part of said problem is the “hates new things” attitude that you and many players like you have.
---
This is a nonsense. There isn't a "hates new things" attitude from people, its a "Hates half assed attempts at making changes to eve with as little dev input as possible or forethought". The blackout was a ridiculous attempt to change the game in a way that was never, ever, going to end well. It was badly thought out ,badly implemented and badly iterated upon. 
---
&gt; Further, your entire way of life, everything that you and your cronies stand for promotes stagnation. 
---
The game promotes stagnation, the way CCP have changed it promotes stagnation. Chaos promotes stagnation as nullsec entities simply don't want to move in order to fight when massive changes could happen at any moment and all their work towards organising people would be for nothing, or worse than nothing, complete ruin. 
---
&gt; On the same side of the fence, you’re claiming that they cannot make any meaningful changes and the game is becoming boring. 
---
There is a really easy way to make meaningful changes to the game, fix the things that are broken and have been broken for aeons. The sov mechanics are just boring as hell and players work around them in order to not engage with them. Citadel spam is just ridiculous, null sec-status mechanics are ridiculous. 
---
&gt; Take a look in the mirror Dave. Eve is boring because you like boring. 
---
No, Eve is boring because the game promotes turtling, cyno changes promote turtling, supercaps promote turtling.  It's ridiculous.
---
&gt; You became the biggest group through excellent cohesion and planning from a small group of people
---
yes, planning based on the game mechanics as they are not as they wanted them to be.
---
&gt;there are more people who are going to find their eve lives more tedious with this change than have their QOL improved. 
---
think of the tactical possibilities opened to fcs over the board or massive qol improvement to wormholers who interact with bookmarks on a much higher level. this is not a change that can be measured in terms of the number of people influenced in a positive vs. negative way. what if the positive effect is much greater for the people it benefits, or what if the overall quality of fights are increased
---
so even if the people who engaged in ded trading is more numerous (doubt) doesn't mean this change isn't an improvement in the grand scheme of things.
---
&gt;Even if you could ban VPN's (it would be a fruitless attempt)
---
Why?
---
&gt;There's many legitimate reasons to run VPN's.
---
If 90%+ of VPN users are bots, is it worth it? What are the legitimate uses that require a VPN?
---
&gt;I can actually confirm in this case, CCP is very quick to jump on 'public' VPN's, I got 3 of my accounts banned because I forgot to disconnect from a TOR VPN and had to find a backup-FC because it took them 3 days to unban me.
---
So we conclude they are already banning VPNs generally?
---
Yeh i mean I don't care either way. If people are stupid enough to run the sites, then they deserve to get nothing. However then its an entire game area that is redundant. So fix it or remove it I guess.
---
If you’re playing wow you probably don’t have the mental capacity to identify friend from foe anyway so it won’t make much of a difference.
---
&gt;CCP can’t/won’t make changes because you will not let them. You didn’t like blackout, they reversed it.
---
This is the only example you have? An example that was ill conceived, terribly implemented, poorly iterated on and had holes in it the size of the grand-canyon? You're just mad that easy kills were taken away from you. There are far better changes to implement that would add meaning to nullsec, rather than turtlewars that eve currently promotes in this iteration of sov-mechanics.
---
First off, I'm not shitting on your expertise (lol) by calling you hackers, so idk why you're bringing that up to me.  I know you're triggered but take some breathes and read my posts.
---
Anyways, to speak to the point, you're saying rather than shoot each other, you just compete to see who can ninja loot the site?  Yeah I'm sorry man, I'm not sure why that is a better game mechanic than forcing a freighter on grid, which can easily be tackled and then lead to an escalation and a potential fight.  You're literally out here trying to defend :elite looting: as better content than :elite pvp:
---
How do you detect someone who does that but not in a spamming manner though? If I'm in an empty system and I say that I saw a Loki, how do you know if I'm lying or not?
---
Blackout was a terrible ideal, implemented badly, not iterated upon and full of holes. It was not even a "try" but simply an easy way to try and change things with a tiny amount of dev input. It was bound to fail from the get-go.
---
Exactly. Pay-to-lose.
---
no. that just means you can dip you're toe in the game for free, but if you want to be a full member with all the options, you have to subscribe.. i dont get why people are mad.. in the old days you did not had free accounts , so its an improvement. Also would point out, the nobody complains about WOW and other mmo rpg games that need subscription to play..
---
Yep.
---
Do I hear another gameplay niche slowly disappearing from Eve Online?
---
less spamming more crabbing
---
You can buy PLEX and sell it in game but that's an expensive habit once you start getting into better ships. Mission running, mining, someone in jita might send you a few mil if you ask.
---
You're not the boss of me!
---
&gt;Go for what hurts.  Don’t become a director (lazy solution anyways).  Make their lives harder.  They will dismantle themselves and take the fun from their own members faster than you can believe if you make it unfun for the directors
---
Starve them of content so that they can get bored of their mining and ratting.
---
I love ppl being polite. I usually just say things like stfu n burn trashbag cause i m bored to explain things.
---
no u
---
Ok sorry!
---
That is completely the opposite of what I said. They do things without thinking. I agree that your point is true too...they think a lot about the future, the current state, what could be done, etc... without ever acting on those things, but then when they do act there's very little thought at all put into it. They're kneejerk reactions to "something".
---
same...all my accounts expire december...this game is not fun anymore
---
I'm talking about being able to do FW without having to join a corp purely dedicated to it. So you could be part of a larger corp yet still participate.
---
I too can falsify Discord messages.
---
The loot range is the size of the sotyio, something like 85km across.
---
Please CCP be more transparent about the vision, even if its "chaotic"  just let us know.
---
Maybe it's because y'all stopped occupying HED and simple farmers blocked everyone out but the biggest blobs :3 They even have dreads and titans now. And yes it's the same people as in 2014 SV5 campers.
---
Its not needed if you are using two publicly routed networks or ipv6 though.
---
The sotiyos (XL engineering complex) that are being referred to here are pirate ones which when killed have a chance to drop a bpc crate for a pirate capital or supercapital, with the super cap bpc being worth hundreds of billions of isk. The problem with it, which OP claims to not be a problem, is that it is easy to steal the loot with a dst without having to put in the same effort or risk that the people who actually kill the sotiyo put in. So to combat this, CCP is changing the size of the bpc crate from 20k m3 to 400k m3 making it a requirement to put a freighter on the grid to loot the wreck which allows for the group that holds the grid to loot while in turn killing OP's current method of stealing.
---
I’m OOTL; what’s near2?
---
If it was such a terrible idea, and implemented badly, why would you expect them to iterate on it? You can't hold lack of iteration on a terrible idea against them. At least give them credit for not following a sunk cost fallacy.
---
Stop pinging the devs for your trash posts
---
Why not use cyno and jump freighter like every other crab did to single system pos while bots auto freighted perfectly safe from bubble to bubble?
---
Send me ingame name I'll give you some isk
---
That requires a lot of bubbles and doesn't affect a dst from mjding out of them.
---
You do know this isn't twitter, right?
---
ty for the rundown!
---
No, people are not going to wait a day in-system, as they slowly respawn, hunting people in anoms isn't really different than belts, although I'll admit I haven't done a lot of that.
---
I have never been in brave tho.
---
Developers don't set the vision of the product....   Product owners do! Stop blaming the developers - this solely rests on the business side of the house for lack of vision, and failing to rank sort the features and capabilities that bring the most value to the end user.
---
I agree all data scraping should be removed.
---
I love playing this game. I love the loot. If I spent hours in a hostile system with minimal support, risking 20-30 billion isk, I wouldn't want it to be easy for someone to steal my spoils either. 
---
While this does benefit Vily, because he uses his position to control who gets what BPCs and who gets charged how much, he is hurting his own followers. Two of the best loot snatchers are his alliance and he is hurting them with this. 
---
Is that a balanced opinion? I believe it is. I'm not intending to he sarcastic. If I have come off that way, please tell me where?
---
Did you even read what you poster?
---
I agree with that 100%. I'm honestly in favor of getting rid of CSM entirely. I do not like the future development of a game I enjoy being influenced by a very select few people, even if they were "democratically elected"
---
I've played multiple games where an influential streamer caused the devs of said games to make a major change that resulted in bad results.
---
Considering there's people out there that go "Relic sites are 100m/hr ezclap" they think that it is an infinitely sustainable income source and I, personally, don't agree.  I still feel that the 25m site I found is the outlier, not the norm; and the normal site is still far less than a Retriever of Veldspar, takes twice as long, and requires active focus instead of just doing it alongside youtube/netflix.
---
Plus with that sheet I posted, if you're able to push 400DPS (Which by their measure is a 'decently fitted T1 Cruiser' though I have doubts) most sites are doable in five minutes.  Drop a MTU, collect blue, maybe salvage, and move along.  9-12m/site, 5-10 minutes per, seems like pretty easy money to me and spawns regularly enough to do either alongside explo or to just skip explo altogether.
---
Whilst I don't wholly disagree with your post it seems odd to argue that a benchmark of effort is required for a piece of emergent gameplay to remain. How then is this defined? If somebody does something more complicated than your infamous drone booshing do they then qualify to dismiss your ability to do anything that seems less complicated? I don't think that's the correct approach though to reiterate I also don't wholly disagree with your point either.
---
Its not data scraping, CCP has offical APIs for it, and it shows in the ingame map aswell
---
Most people suggest running the career agents completely, then completing the sisters of Eve epic arc, which is a series of 50 missions which will continue to help you get familiar with game, as well as put some extra isk in your pocket. By then I'm sure you'll figure out some of the ways people make isk in game, whether that be mining, exploration, ratting, or joining a corporation to name a few.
---
I'm not an expert on this, but I thought it was illegal (in the USA) to use software that disrupts a service - and that companies like blizzard have successfully gone after developers of botting software.
---
nice sleeper loot 12t and nullsec 17t. time to nerf WH space
---
The part that's true.  Since what you just said is demonstrably false.
---
Rote Kapelle who shit all over local when passing through cloud ring because we were Goon pets... Welcome to the club brothas and sistas! I hope you find the water to your liking!
---
Nothing with structures was changed. 
---
That change only affected using fof missiles at absurd ranges ~500km to kill npcs who wouldnt respond/react because &gt;ai&lt;
---
I can change my IP with a cable modem and router in seconds by editing my MAC address.
---
Which could be a reason why they fail with it. Faux Scrum. Unfortunately throws a bad light on the right Scrum.
---
You guys were pets, we're proper imperium. Means you are now our pets!
---
Probably went down because everyone was out hunting in 0.0 instead of farming.
---
How many players in wormholes compared to nullsec ?
---
From what I can tell it's 6 people born in iceland who palm the work and responsibility off to a steady rotation of 16 people born outside iceland who can't be bothered and also don't give a shit because they're off to EA as soon as they have 2 years on their CV.
---
Ok.... if you say so.
---
Long live the Theran alliance.
---
original elements of EVE are so trivial even a 5th grader could make AHK scripts for things to automate autopilot or mining an entire belt. (click on rock in overview, click orbit every 30 seconds, click lasers in a timed sequence so that you cut them at 99% of they are on)
---
Was looking good, but now that Rote has joined imperium, its going to get a lot less good fairly quickly. Unspoken is closely allied with Rote so even if they don't officially become goon pets they're effectively goon pets. FE is probably going to have to become panfam pets to survive, and everyone else in the area is going to get pushed into one of those two categories or get pushed out of the north entirely.
---
I said above and previously that blackout was not done well, though it WAS an improvement, and the cyno changes were just bad in general. Citadel spam is another important thing that needs to be fixed, RF timers too.
---
The entire concept of sov encourages turtling. That’s your chosen play style, not the game. 
---
“Take sov, hold sov, farm” -That’s what you and the majority of eve players have chosen. It’s high sec with extra steps.
---
New sov isn’t valuable once you have sov, so “take” has no teeth. “Hold” is turtle up. “Farm” is the main problem-attitude with the game.
---
The other large majority chose “Log in, farm” (highsec)
---
My main criticism of your OP was that it’s an attitude that increases game stagnation. That’s the problem.
---
So instead of ninja loot &gt; warp out, it now warp in a bunch of tornadoes, kill the freighter, ninja loot with a ceptor and warp out (with a 50% chance of loot getting destroyed, int hat case it generates a nice killmail). I like this change.
---
But yeah, just making the sotiyo drop a can to which people have to burn to (instead of having such a huge looting radius) would have been better idea.
---
???? I mean, I don't say so. The development manifesto for agile/scrum and the processes put in place by PMI for development say so.
---
Heathen!!!! May you be smote by my independent lightening!!!!
---
With your first point, it's kind of a well known fact and ccp has said as much.
---
As for your 2nd point, you seem to be agreeing with me, so we have some common ground there. Pre injector it sucked to have a bot toon banned because you had to wait for a new toon to be skilled.
---
They could have joined GOTB...
---
It's some salty dude trying to (badly) impersonate/harass me. Ignore him, and if you want updates, check for "Update" in my post history. We live in Vale and these guys have been dropping hobo structures across our sov while feeding ihubs+ships, and occasionally gifting us ihubs (half the ihubs in the gekj pocket were stolen from them in failed drops).  
---
I'm at work or I'd be a little more eloquent. :)
---
Name some of the catalysts in the game that promote sov-fights right now.
---
Exactly. Idk why they didn't just put local on a delay, even a 1 or 2 minute delay is enough to fuck bot swarms.
---
Theregoesjoe character name  not found
---
&gt;But it determines this IP address via ARP, which is based on your MAC address.
---
it's the opposite, ARP tells you which MAC has the IP you need to send data to, on the interface your route tells you to send it.
---
ALso IGP is not used to allow an arbitrary internet server to send data back to you through a router.
---
THIS IS A PVE GAME
---
Having to figure out relatively simple solutions to this problem is NOT ok, they’re using SUPER CAPITALS ok, they’re RISKING SUPER CAPITALS (under umbrella range), sure MAYBE they could gatecamps the sotiyo system and actually have a small fleet defending it and the runners, but that isn’t at all a realistic expectation of nullblocs with 30k+ players in them
---
If you can’t solve a problem by dropping a super on it it must be broken
---
I am also a pvp-only player (wallet warrior who doesnt like cap gameplay or any of the PvE eve has to offer). That said, they \*have\* to cater to the PvE playstyle as they can't afford to chase them off, because without them, I don't have much to hunt outside of other hunters (who are, in turn, hunting them). 
---
Eve is like an ecosystem and PvE players are the herbivores. If you lose enough of them the ecosystem breaks down an the carnivores start dying off. Sure sometimes we have to evolve our hunting methods, but I'd much rather have to evolve "how" i hunt than evolve where/what I hunt (my where would just be "another game").
---
I mean it's an exploit and cheating. People buying isk via rmt are getting it a whole lot cheaper then people buying plex from ccp.
---
I don't necessarily disagree, i don't know enough about the involved looting mechanics to tell you if it is balanced or not.  
---
What i was trying to say is that ccp shouldn't just take balance input from a single csm member, or atleast not without taking a deeper look at why that member is lobbying for those changes.  
---
There are changes that are unanimous, and are right. But usually it should throw up some red flags if there are no other parties that disagree with the proposed changes.
---
When did they add the scan resolution penalty?
---
You didn't answer my question - If it was a TERRIBLE idea, and it was IMPLEMENTED BADLY - why would you want them to iterate on it? Wouldn't the best thing for someone of your opinion for them to abandon it, and NOT iterate on it?
---
Oh yeah, 100% agree with you there. I understand the balance you were talking about now.
---
It just requires you to not be a fucking retard and actually protect the system the sotiyo is in, how hard is that?
---
You are conflating game development with software development. Working on software for a company is different compared to game development in so much that you have developers and coders who work side by side to ensure something is workable.
---
I never said that, do you know how to read? I said a few minute delay would probably help in respect to botting. Which means 1 that I am not sure and 2 I did not mention how it would effect the rest of eve, it was simply a thought on botting.
---
They eventually did the best thing, but prior to that, with the continuation, they could have at least done something to make it a tiny bit better.
---
It's a matter of scale. For a game like eve with such a low player count, rmt is very rampant.
---
Think of alpha as free to play but most of the game is gated. Omega allows you to access at the content.
---
The biggest difference was that bet ratters were never AFK, unless they were bots.  You just couldn't AFK belt ratting.
---
Another big difference was belt ratters moved a lot more, so the chances of catching someone coming out of warp were a lot better.  Realistically, if someone is smart and not AFK, they are going to be hard to catch unless they are in warp when you +1 regardless of if they are in a belt or anom.
---
Also, they were more spread out,with no more then one or two dudes in a system, so it was harder for them to get help.   This was all back before everyone just fit cynos, but that's gone now anyway.
---
Also, the fact that they were spread out just made hunting more engaging.  You basically every system with more then 5 belts usually had someone ratting in it.
---
sometimes you find out stuff only when you try peeking into random directions. Blackout was too much tho.
---
Gotta get those banned bots back in action somehow "cryface"
---
Nah, I don’t like wasting my time killing VNIs etc. it’s boring. Literally more exciting to kill an NPC. That’s the typical assumption, though. Blackout was nice because groups would run into each other on accident and prompt an unplanned fight. That said, it was a bit too drastic all at once, because the ratters and the miners literally lost their heads. They were told it was instant death to go out, and so the majority simply logged out. When it went on longer than a week or two they started unsubbing. It’s because of your mind set and unwillingness to actually try and play the game.
---
&gt; With your first point, it's kind of a well known fact and ccp has said as much.
---
they really did? Because its totally idiotic, like telling all RMTers of eve how to RMT without a trace. A game dev giving away such an important detail is frankly, incredibly stupid.
---
I heard you can take systems away from provi and hold them indefinitely with almost no effort.
---
FE are already on friendly terms with PanFam though, and often use them as a batphone on major timers.
---
You're right, if the Rage eviction and Nomex evictions have taught us anything, it's that wormholes are TOO safe and nobody ever loses anything.  What was I thinking?  You got me bud!
---
&gt; You can be completely tabbed out playing WoW and watching Netflix and still make isk while getting off safe by using near. 
---
Spoken like someone who lives safely in a big blue donut without "neuts".
---
Busy with kneejerk low effort bandaids, no actual "hard" changes.  Again, where is their dev time actually going?
---
&gt; My reply regarding IGP is you said there was no other way to route between networks than with NAT,
---
Sorry but I said it in the context of the CCP servers sending data back to your through your router. In that case the CCP server is an arbitrary server, and you NEED NAT to communicate with it over internet, if you have a router, you can't use IGP to communicate with it(becasue you have no communication with its private network)
---
It's not a separate issue, its an issue that was completely involved with the blackout that basically meant NPCing was ship-suicide.
---
No one wants sov fights because sov fights are boring as shit!
---
Why?  If falcon replies, it'll just be vague shit that you want to hear, whether there's any actual truth behind it at all.
---
At least its a sliver of hope.
---
Was thinking of it more from a characters standpoint. I havent noticed a real drop in predators (I watch intel looking for things to fight), just prey when I roam. Probably different where you hunt though.
---
so uh /thread?
---
Ya you are right because if ualx and b-r nullsec is insanely dangerous. Picking the biggest fights in wspace is stupid when you compare to nullsec. Nullsec loses way more stuff.
---
Explain to me how this would benefit anyone but the biggest fish?
---
If you read the csm minutes there was disagreement about it. The whole narrative that only vily said it is a lie.
---
THE AT DIED FOR THIS!!
---
of course :p
---
Yeah people are definitely complaining all over this sub about how fluid and non-stagnant null is these days.  Lots of complaints about how people keep getting evicted, losing their homes, etc etc.  Too much actually.  If only CCP would give us the tools to settle into small areas and overfarm them to death.  Then we'd be onto something.  
---
Tell me more about nullsec loss please.  Especially in light of the massive player drop that just occurred when the potential for loss was introduced.  I'd really like to hear more of your thoughts that are totally supported by recent events.
---
Hey, like I said, blackout was poorly implemented because there were lots of other things that needed to be done first or simultaneously. The cloaking issue could have been addressed prior to anything to do with blackout. People think it’s an impossible issue though, so I don’t know what more can be done about it.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if falcon turned off notifications for username mentions a long time ago, the amount of name calling, poop flinging, and toxic levels of salt in this sub is rediculous.
---
There was an exploit with killing Faction Warfare targets with ships full of items manipulated to an absurd price. [see here](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=124145)  It's also astonishing that you can get on the CSM after this.
---
Coming from Eve Vegas last year they delivered on everything that was discussed iirc - which included things like the war changes (which were a great step), ansiblex gates (which were a poor design choice that makes space feel dead, but hey they look neat), 64 bit client, abyssal pvp sites (should have been for the frig groups imo, cruisers was a bad choice) and new trig ships.
---
Then coming from Toronto fanfest this year they also delivered on the new wormhole effects and VNI changes that were discussed. The discussed reboot of tieracide seems to have gone nowhere however.
---
The things that are discussed as possibilities during open questions should not be taken as actual announcements and I think that is where this sense comes from.
---
I can start my own VPN using a cloud probably in about 15 minutes.
---
For a minute I thought you only linked their losses page but then I realized you didn't and it's just the same
---
4k dps leshak.
---
I'll check it if i can be fucked at some point. I just went off of the OP, so my comment might not even apply to this situation at all depending on if OP lied or not.
---
Following the downhill trend of bounties from before the blackout, current values are about what would have been predicted at this time anyway.  Farmers farm until they have the top tier loot, then quit.
---
What a time to live in null
---
big if true. A good NPE is critical to retention. The tutorials only graze the surface of this game, and should at the very least teach the rudiment of flying in a fleet
---
That was /u/6a6566663437 's point which is why I wanted to correct you to help build a better understanding.
---
It's irrelevant whether there is a router in play or not, NAT is not a deciding factor or impactful in any meaningful way.
---
You can tell you're right by how there was two thousand seven numbers online last night, soon there won't be anything left but farmers and Bots oh, and that's not going to be enough for Pearl Abyss to leave the lights on
---
You might understand one day :D
---
On a serious note: it’s fine with me for that to be your goal, but would it make the game unplayable for you if ccp managed to kill all bots, but in the process it took 1/3 off your ratting income? Or, rorquals could no longer mine entirely afk en masse while 100% safe?
---
No, that actually fixes none of what I'm talking about.
---
Mostly squatters/small gangs controlling local space. Pretty neat tbh
---
the looting dst stays on grid for much longer than minute or two before looting
---
Trying to have an intelligent conversation with Dave is impossible btw
---
If you're the hard knocks guy me and a buddy were dealing with in the dronelands for one particular sotiyo, I recall you guys succeeding to kill 1 of our 4 DSTs, and losing 2 sabres in the process to the rats.
---
So.... I'm gonna call BS on that.
---
To be fair, I like other aspects of the game too. I do a good amount of PvP with the corp and I enjoy just being around the other members, but though it doesn't make the game "unplayable" it does make it a hell of a lot less enjoyable. They've nerfed Rorqs *horribly* just because they couldn't figure out how to prevent Delve from mining as much as the rest of the game combined, so they came up with an easy "reduce it all" fix.
---
I'm tired of spending a year and tens-of-billions of ISK to get into something that I enjoy just for them to nerf it into the ground because one specific group does it a ton. They've literally dropped the amount a Rorq can mine by around 50% and made it much harder to prevent Excavs from being killed. There's a *lot* more risk with *WAY* less reward.
---
And I'm not looking for it to be 100% safe...but when I put 2 8b ships on-grid to do mining that could lose 2.4b of drones with a single bomb, it better damn-well make pretty good isk-per-hour. As it stands it's more than 72h of straight mining with no loss to recoup the cost of the ship and fit itself...before you start even making money.
---
Tell me another activity in the game where it takes 72 hours of that activity to pay for the ship required to do it.
---
&gt;developers and coders
---
Those are the same thing. /u/MindlessPresent is factually correct here, and clearly you have no clue what you're talking about.
---
His job isn't to cater to every moron crying about every thing they do. You're just entitled so think your post warrants a direct reply.
---
Cynos were omega only before the change too...

 has been gweat in the past at wesponding to me on hewe, even if we haven’t seen eye to eye.
---
So... you simply don't know what you're talking about.
---
This is what happens when you're clueless and try to shitpost. Delete it, and then let people try to figure out what your OP was about.
---
POSes, which citadels replace, dropped loot when destroyed. It makes perfect sense for citadels to drop loot.
---
How are you getting those bubbles on grid and anchored without getting tackled by rats?
---
This makes how profitable it is comparatively scary at how much is made for how little is lost for how few people are there
---
You just made the opposition’s point for them
---
Not as many, but they have very comparable isk generation as a whole and a lot less value killed.
---
Yea fucking throw in the towel so easy. Easy roads and empires are the path of the lazy
---
They're "independent" and "going really well"
---
And that "balance" change is anti-eve and only benefits the larger groups
---
And how do you do that without running gatecamps around the clock from the time the sotiyo spawns to the time it’s ran to prevent a dst from getting in?
---
&gt; He graduated university last year and now works as a Junior Software Developer
---
Junoir, meh. I heared graduating makes you senior Software Devoper automatically.
---
I also would like to add that making a mistake and then not fixing it, like you were saying, is bad. However, acknowledging a system isn’t working as intended (local) and deciding to just neglect it is even worse. 
---
The problem I had with blackout was that they did it poorly and then just totally undid it with no new plan or solution. There are a lot of core systems that needed to be fixed prior to or with blackout for it to work. Such as: **cynos** (NOT fixed), **structures** (need I say more?), **capitals** (deserve buffs WHEN cynos are properly fixed), **cloaks** (need counterplay) 
---
Balancing some of these is very much dependent on the other.
---
what’s scary is how much fewer people is in wormholes
---
So 1/100th the population of null is making 70% of the amount of isk of the null pop
---
And they cry the hardest about how “null isk printing is bad for the economy” it’s ridiculous
---
Yea man, I should probably specify because most people would assume that, having that little green is actually astounding.
---
The risk/reward level of the mechanic.
---
HS missions are technically infinite isk and super easy- therefore, are they OP? no, because they take forever. 
---
How much effort does it take to get 300B out of C6 wormhole ratting? Months, with lots of setup and knowledge.
---
How long does it take to get a 300B Komodo BPC? Not much- you just need a little luck.
---
Kanye would find some. Trust.
---
Is it really not obvious to you that 75% + of the player base is gone. The numbers are just substained by alts and random alphas passing through.
---
Underrated comment
---
I think that ship has sailed, how about a realistic fix?
---
LMFAO
---
So can you share what the team's main priorities are at the moment and what you're hoping to tackle over, say, the next 6-12 months?
---
If the team is growing, why? For what purpose?
---
i’m really happy my friends in rote kapelle are joining the imperium. they have worked tirelessly over the past decade to be good enough to join. glad they have achieved their goals
---
They deserve it for putting up with your posts 🤪
---
They're not going to announce Jack fucking shit at Vegas. It'll be more of the same "we hear you" and "we're paying close attention" they've been pulling for years.
---
They'll make some more empty promises about looking into balancing T1 ships but conveniently leave out any hard objectives or deadlines and hope that you eventually give up hope for it, like Tiericide and Shield Slaves.
---
They've got fucking nothing.
---
You said the rage eviction was an indication of the danger of wormhole space, I related it ualx which is a massive loss in nullsec or the fight where the Russians lost their super fleet. If you are going to use 1 big fight to represent the danger of wormhole space I can do the same with nullsec.
---
This is from the previous months of 2019.
---
Delve for scale.

No. V0lta
---
No probs, the kills data CCP puts out is really rich in details but not well analyzed by the community. I'm working on trying to find a way to classify players by where they have the most isk killed/lost.
---
There are multitudes of things they could have done in a 3 month period to fix the blackout. I’ve yet to say blackout was the best idea ever, in fact go look up all the comments I’ve had about the blackout.
---
Preeeeetty accurate...yeah.
---
That's a bummer. I'm thinking I may have even fought you guys before with one of our standing sink fleets. I'm only on about an hour a night so I only see a small part of late-ish USTZ. 
---
I absolutely love when people swing by and I can undock a slow fat ship to fight in (or a ceptor to try to tackle them if kitey). 
---
I guess it just depends when you swing by and who is on. The group in my TZ tend to undock kitchen sink stuff and camp gates and/or chase. Hell, I have a shitfit version of every T1 Frig I fly until I lose with the intent to lose one of every frig.
---
Literally unp(l)ayable.
---
I won EvE two years ago because the community is a bunch of whiny, salty, entitled man children.
---
you know who made EvE not fun anymore?
---
You guys.
---
&gt; There are two major problems in Eve online which lead to negative changes in this game. The first is the player base as can be see in some of the comments below and in many other threads across /r/eve, it's a game that supposedly cherishes how difficult things are, how cut throat of a universe it is and so forth yet the moment anything does not go the way of the masses there's a huge amount of complaining. 'Harden the fuck up' is a term that can only be applied to other people, but it's a term the community love to pretend applies to everything.
---
Man I can't agree more with this, you have this guy whining in this post about losing his 93% easy success rate, instead of figuring out how to adapt to changes. I appreciate you pointing this out.
---
Yes, but with dual web, you'll apply fast enough that the other frigate/destroyer is going to be dead before he realizes that it's time to warp off.
---
why do you let go CCP away with the "tradeoff" and dont insist in a solution who actualy just works?
---
I can't speak for the priorities of the whole Dev team no, and I wouldn't want to comment out of line on who's being hired for what. The team I work on is currently working on new player improvements, shareable bookmarks and other things I can't currently talk about.
---
I know this may not be the official response people want, but I couldn't leave such doom and gloom unanswered. Hope it helps at least a little bit!
---
Understandable; it is a random assortment of ore.  Though don't the belts contain ABC?
---
Yup thank you for the response!
---
you describe a solution to a problem what ist totaly fine in the actual system just using contracts and works well
---
why do you let CCP go away with this
---
Using a script to automate the looting? 
---
I imagine it would allow you to move at speed through the loot radius, automatically click open and loot (maybe loot all?) The bp the moment you are in range, and then click jump faster than human input could manage.
---
I don't disagree with people quitting though when they don't like something. Unfortunately, the only way to show CCP how important something is is to vote with your wallet...they've shown very clearly they don't determine their path because of opinions from players. The reason they walked back the blackout and cyno changes (minutely) is because people quit giving them money.
---
From a Capitalistic point of view, that's the way it should be. A company that's not giving their customers what they want **deserves** to fail. For that reason I think it's a **good** thing if CCP walks back their changes, if the playerbase doesn't like them. I think the biggest "complaint" group these days is not the players complaining about changes but the players complaining about CCP bowing to the compainers. There is a group of people that thinks CCP should just change up the game to keep it active or to make the game harder, but unfortunately the voting group (the group that pays their bills) doesn't really want that. It sounds like it's a popular idea, because negatives are always the loudest, but CCP obviously knows what is affecting their bottomline most.
---
But yes, you're right -- the way to fix it is to give incentive for being active. As it stands they made it pointless to try and Rorq mine with a small group or solo just as a side-effect of trying to cut Delve down.
---
That’s an awesome mindset. I hope we run into each other in the future. Aideron robotics is just an anonymous name, btw. One thing that our group prides itself on is taking just about any subcap fight within in reason, and lots outside reason. Ratios of about 4 :1 or caps are where we call it.
---
Its even more true with game development - which is a subset of software development. The product owner sets the value to the end users, while developers are solutioning on the user stories set by the product owner. I do this for a living mate.
---
Hmm, not sure if this is trolling.  Money laundering generally relates to crime and RMTing is not criminal activity.
---
Regulating RMT sellers would be more of a commercial approach.  It could be done through the EULA and taxes levied ingame.
---
I'm not that serious about these issues.  Just stopped by to share that I think the drug dealer analogy is a good one but it highlights that a war on RMT is all but unwinnable.
---
Sometimes they give us the faction fit [hauler](https://imgur.com/a/3KrS1in) too
---
Which topic? The one where someone asked "Hey, I don't understand this? Can someone explain how this would be used?"
---
Or do you just not read the whole thread and reply to a random comment in the middle of the thread based solely on the title of a post which had no topic and was just an image?
---
And then while your at it not read my entire two sentences and then make assumptions that what I'm saying is wrong even though what I'm saying is exactly what your saying I'm not saying?
---
jfc train reading comprehension lvl 2 at least.

You are welcome space friend, have a good weekend!

I only 'upgraded' from XP when I was absolutely forced to.

And i'm still using Windows 7 now.
---
I'm not an expert and I don't know how or why this works, but I'd be happy to demonstrate through teamspeak or something that I can change my IP address in the time it takes to restart my docsis 3 modem by changing the CMAC value in my router - a technique I was told was called cloning the mac address.
---
i see also all your points and agree more to the first 2
---
eskalation farmer usually search the corp/alliance contracts in the region for there need even just to fill 30min of idle time 
---
we need a solution for this problem or it will again kill a part of the gameplay who just works fine right now
---
You do realize the changes mean you couldn’t fit them on your current ships any more right?
---
It is entirely possible to hit over 100% resists, i've seen it done with a DST overheating active hardeners in a c6 red Red Giant and yes, you do die instantly since your resists overflow to negative values.
---
How have so many people literally ignored you saying “another omega” and gone “dur hur buh cynoz was alreddy omega hur hur”
---
It’s like the IQ of this sub is declining faster than Post-chaos player counts
---
........ yeah........ try thy....
---
if there is thrust i would thrust CCP and the CSM to make the game better for everyone and not just go the easy way stealing actual working contend and playerinteraction from the table and not make it better for everyone no replace it with a shitty version where players just only from the description in a devblog disagree with 
---
cant be hard to give auto access via contract to one bookmark for 24h and delete it after
---
The thing with Eve, compared to say Minecraft, is that cheating adversely affects every player in the game. If I found an exploit allowing for duplicating of ISK, I could completely change the economy, affecting thousands of players (imagine someone bought all of the items in Jita because they essentially have infinite money, you'd completely crash the economy and kill the game if left unfixed).
---
If you duplicate diamonds in Minecraft, the only one you are affecting is you. You could also just cheat using the Cheat Engine and give you stacks upon stacks of diamonds if you want.
---
CCP has a much bigger incentive to finding and fixing these bugs than Mojang. If Mojang had CCP's incentive to fix dupe bugs, they would've fixed it.
---
eve is great example for RL why communism can't work ... there will be always people which cares about money (virtual or not) more than anything else :D
---
CCP be like: Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
---
&gt;I would kill to see CCPs sprint board.
---
are you really assuming they know what that is for other than drawing funny pictures with permanent markers on it?
---
We  push closer to 300/h/c in optimized fleets 180-225 on newbro fleets.
---
&gt; Every single way they've come up with so far has helped botting
---
This is clearly untrue and disingenuous.  Whatever your opinion is of blackout, it *absolutely* was a major blow to botting.  
---
You can argue about how many moved to high sec, but it absolutely wasn't all of them.  Many bots stopped operations.  And those that didn't had their income reduced from VNI ratting to venture or battleship mining in high sec.
---
i was on a new account yesterday and an eve gm pm'd!  he was very nice and asked if i needed help i told him that i was a veteran player so we talked about eve  he loves eve like i do and it was fun talking with him   (✿◠‿◠) 
---
i'm on vacation and i am logging into eve because i love this game  (◕‿◕✿) 
---
i love that nullsec local is back because most of all eve is about community and i felt like i was all alone and now i am not because i see all the pilots in local  (✿◠‿◠)   i like being able to see them all  red light blue dark blue gray orange purple and green  **(✿◕‿◕✿)** 
---
i cannot be a good man but i will be a good woman this friday   **(◕‿◕✿)** 
---
i hope that boombudder is better soon and does not have to go to icu again and that he isn't bored in eve any more either   (✿◠‿◠)
---
&gt;then I would force more fights by making resource migrate as they're drained.
---
because getting constantly stomped by a bloc as it moves for resources is an excellent way to get people to not join blocs.
---
Right about the time I started playing. 
---
You're welcome! 😘
---
Muninns can only hit 100k with max skills with max range ammo at fall off, while you can hit that range even with Thorium (at fall off, iridium without fall off) and max out at 146/161 with spike. So if you can kite properly, you can beat muninns with eagles (and ferox, but eagles are better).
---
That’s what I meant. Read the sentence again.
---
&gt;disabling log will stop near2.
---
Because the Eve client is the only possible way to communicate over the Internet.
---
&gt;manipulating/reading ram memory data is also easily tackled with anti-cheat software.
---
Nope.  It isn't.
---
The people manipulating/reading memory have absolute control of the client system.  They control the kernel.  Your anti-cheat software only sees what they want you to see.
---
Yes, that means that badly-written bots can be caught.  But there's no particular reason everyone has to restrict themselves to badly-written bots.  And thanks to the Internet, only one person on the planet has to write the code to defeat your anti-cheat.
---
Game companies will claim their anti-cheat software is wonderful, unbreakable and catching all sorts of people....because they don't want you to bot.  Not because it's actually wonderful, unbreakable and catching all sorts of people.
---
It was a pacifier and enforcer btw, just to correct (a SINGLE Marshal was given to each person who went to both Fanfest and Vegas that year) - but yeah, the distribution for those was quite the debacle
---
It wasn't really an issue till they extended the skill queue.
---
It does not.
---
I had a cyno alt that just flew frigs and dictors, itll fly a falcon now in 3 days. Why wouldn't anyone else do this? What a mystery this dumb thread is
---
what was the name of the site ? did you fail a hack ?
---
Take a queue from DICE and start making community roadmaps and interacting more with your playerbase to understand actual wants and needs, rather than arbitrary "balance" hack jobs based on spreadsheet metrics?
---
5500 active accounts from the like 20k? active users ... This ship is sinking fast
---
I love the way DICE handled StarWars Battlefront 2 after the tsunami of hate. They started making community roadmaps to share with us, got involved more in forums and social media to understand how people play and what actual issues there are.
---
The key there is that they reach out to ALL the community (probably smaller than EVE albeit) and not a consortium of players and lawyers from the biggest most one sided alliances in the game to understand how to develop the game for EVERYONE.
---
I mean the hate train exists because bots exist, in masse. If the tools they had for detecting bots where great it wouldn't be a problem to hate :P
---
You don't have to run your bots all the time....
---
They've started their vision MANY times. Making eve harder for veterans and easier for new players. They are working towards those changes.
---
It's not a road map (Hilmar said there won't be a specific roadmap), rather a guiding principle and vision, which HAS been provided.
---
Are you fucking brain dead? Just run it once you find it and get a gatecamp up ASAP, if it’s in your space you should have intel on it first, you’ve also got magical fatigue-less jumpbridges for you to get there fastest plus it’s not quick/easy/risk free getting a DST through supposedly hostile space from a sorta nearby wormhole.
---
Like why should it be so easy for you? this is supposed to be high level content it should require more competence than just sitting around taking hours if not days to form up and then afk bashing it in supers you stupid fuck
---
More people would be logged in.
---
More characters

People like you make people like me wish we were in 2015 or before again.

&gt; It is expected that Tranquility will be back online and accepting connections at 11:30 UTC. 
---
Is anybody *really* expecting that? :P
---
a poopoo head
---
There's a lot of holes in that logic. First, pve is incredbly safe and cyno changes just push more people into capitals, not subcaps to stay safe. It just requires one more alt to sit on grid. Also, some people would like to do more than gank ratters or structures as content drivers
---
Highsec miners helping in a wardec? Lol
---
at least there'll be ~~an AT next year~~ Eve online next year, right?
---
What happened to you r/eve, you used to be someone I could trust...
---
I tend to give CCP the benefit of the doubt and really think this place is overflowing with people with no will or drive to adapt but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated myself. There seems to be no movement or direction. I was fine with blackout and am fine without. I like the cyno changes as they eliminate win button gameplay and force people to actually plan and consult with others for response fleets or security. There just seems to be no movement to refine this game or implement features that make any appreciable impact. Im curious as to what CCP is actually doing. This patch is shockingly devoid of actual content.
---
This isn't even a hotfix, much less a patch or release.
---
If it's luck why is he successful 90% of the time?
---
hA Ha i hAvE tHiS mAnY aCcoUntS
---
No. Consider it a penalty for being dumb enough to put them into a MTU in the first place.
---
Can confirm. Orbiting a sov structure for 20 min is terribly boring. No one will contest either.
---
cHaOs
---
Nope, no need.
---
I don’t think it’s even remotely possible to make mechanics that improve life for newbies without improving it for vets at the same time.
---
Oh yeah, so what that now you can't trade with half the people you were able to. Why don't we just ban null-sourced materials from entering highsec, same thing right?
---
Taking the piss here of course, and personally I don't give a rat's arse about this particular issue (wormholer btw). I just know how it works and how much PITA is trading bookmarks already is.
---
This is good shit.
---
That's why I know that CCP will overthink it and fuck it up.
---
The P really stands for Procrastrination.
---
r/woosh
---
Idk what you're getting at. Plainly more were logged in preblackout. 
---
Local is back but numbers are still down. The only thing that remains is the cyno change.
---
Thank you so very much for this. Really, genuinely, thank you.
---
That's some extremely surface level thinking lol
---
Sweeeeeet I'll definitely check that out. Thanks!
---
How was jumping to a pos risky? Unless there was a titan actually sat on grid or a full sub cap fleet of dps your freighter was immune to being harmed. Light Cyno min distance from shield and float in under 10 seconds, Your pos guns would melt anything able to blap it under a Titan or whole fleet.
---
You are talking complete shit, pos shields and guns made cyno risk free.
---
&gt;I am a wormhole pilot myself
---
I would never have guessed!
---
Sounds like a party, I cant wait for the rest of the comments 🍿
---
The "vision" CCP has at the moment, is that the bonus period is about to end and there's really nothing they can do in the space of a week or two to influence whatever payout they are going to get so hilmeth is just sitting there in his office waiting to be handed his check so he can go back to being an AFK CEO for CCP and start working on the games being made by the new company he just bought a large stake in. Within a few months we won't hearing anything from Hilmeth, he'll just dump this whole mess in Falcon's lap and peace out.
---
/r/nocontext
---
No, it was to force owners of caps/supers to rely on other people for support. Subbing an alt is a choice you make to not have to rely on other people in a multiplayer game.
---
Via NEAR2. I think you are missing what I am saying.
---
I'm not misunderstanding you at all. I am saying that the methodology you are proposing is dumb, but you keep sticking to your guns.  Keep screeching though, I find it hilarious.
---
fuck there's a lot of *words* in this thread and I'm stoned.
---
In no way will disabling logs stop near2, it will just read a discord channel instead.
---
Safer, no. But it makes it unlikely to get ninja looted obviously.
---
Yeap. That happened. So... Either you and your corp will need to figure out how to kill that FOB, or you'll need to move your mining ops around for a few days to find a place where you won't get doomballed. Because unfortunately, actually fighting off the diamond rats themselves isn't really a thing (unrewarding, and they 're damn tanky).
---
The spice must flow
---
No he wants the player to figure out how to beat them. Making ccp change the game isn't figuring out how to beat other players.
---
So they have to work for it instead of having 400b isk handed to them?
---
Again you misunderstand me. You are quite mentally unfortunate, aren’t you?
---
“Via near2”? What you’re saying doesn’t make any sense. In this hypothetical scenario, near2 is *rendered inoperable due to a code change.* Answer me, then, if Eve does not log to a text file anymore, *which is how near2 works*, how could it be used?
---
Keep being wrong. Your stupidity gives me strength.
---
And 3. How do you do it so the last time doesn't repeat.
---
i.e Goons relocate and the coalition made to fight them collapses.
---
It seems that y'all have been working on the NPE for years now. Ever since the alpha clone change. But it doesn't feel like much work is being done retaining existing players and keeping them engaged.
---
I want that Neon Ishtar but that is probably just a fuckup as well.

The Kill

This
---
Are you the guy who is remaking the group that the original founders and older members agreed not to remake?
---
Blackout brought the game back and way bulldozing the weak. Just like the good ole days, “This game isn’t for you nor does it need you,  go back to WoW”.
---
All blackout did was kill the hardcore care bears who want to krab all day. I don’t care about you neither did falcon. The game doesn’t need you and was at its best when you couldn’t krab 23/7. 
---
So again, no. Blackout didn’t “almost” kill eve, it just killed krabs gameplay which is killing the game.
---
#fuckkrabs

he's not talking about the rocks you can see in the screenshot, some sites actually do have ore in them
---
i don't know if this particular one does so maybe check before being a smartass

Needs a tldr or a less bait title then
---
Honestly, at this point it's ok to beg.  The past few months in eve have looked way rougher than the usual "CCP problems."
---
Thanks, reddit dose not want me to upload the screenshot
---
Probably just the people who resubbed for black out leaving
---
Audiobooks are a thing
---
How do you win a game that is unwinnable? 
---
Eve has no end conditions built into it. It ends when the playerbase dies.
---
Thank you sir. It helps more than you know.

if only haven's gave 200b ticks

Being an ECM pilot, any ship hull involved therein, any SP invested in to skills that have to deal with making ecm better, sensor compensation skills.
---
You set your own end conditions then attain them. That's how you win.
---
It was pretty shitty, considering that i remember hundreds of them being given to dudes who had been ghost training when enforcers were something like 1-2.5b/each. I can't remember if CCP walked back that reward scheme or just cut them loose, but it was absolutely insane that it was even allowed in the first place.
---
Uh oh, it looks like I struck a nerve - lol
---
You're totally right bro, I'm super triggered right now. Eve is dying, and the blue doughnut has ended the world.
---
Let's go play Infinity Battlescape - I hear that's where all the cool kids are these days. ;)
---
Good thing you're not a designer then 😁
---
What’s your suggestion?
---
LNAW ragequit bbc forming their own alliance to evict snuff to high sec
---
Edit: Serious talk now, when you have the biggest alliances blue to eachother and the low sec is dead, what do you expect alliances like snuff to do? Snuff adapted because they are good and are still slowly dying but the rest low sec alliances got murdered by ccp decisions...
---
Praise the good old days😔
---
Woaw thanks for the downvote, seeing the great answers to the other launcher problem it gives me lot of hope,

Crazy community

Of course there are game breaking glitches no one knows about. They always exist. Like the one where, under heavy server load, proper timing and "doing the thing that needed to be done" you were once able to make your ship literally unlockable if you managed to log out and back in quickly enough to "fall through the cracks", so to speak. Who heard of that one? It was even posted on reddit, during a Burn Jita. I don't know if this still works, I'm not going to try and the required circumstances are rather specific.
---
Anyhow, that line has been in many patchnotes and not always we got to know what got patched out, because sometimes people who discover exploits don't publicly talk about them. They use that same line for pretty much every single fixed exploit.
---
Like preventing the faction police from engaging your -5 character, which afaict was relatively unheard of. I might be wrong, of course. Or literally item duplication, which was indeed an actual exploit some years ago.
---
Huge developments coming. There are some skins available in the store, some limited edition skins, some other skins that will be only sold during specific hours and a few other skins for sale. Other then that unless something breaks (and we can claim its a planned "Chaos" event), no there is nothing else coming out soon.
---
In that sense, winning partly involves community maintenance, by itself or the developer.
---
I used to play another game similar to EVE (group oriented; strongly competitive; items drop on death; territory/resource control) that faced a similar existential crisis.  The game mechanics were very opaque and there was no tutorial, so most players were awful to the point of not even using equipment because they were "just gonna lose it anyway". Those of us who were invested enough to work things out stomped everyone else into the ground, either not realizing the consequences or not wanting to compromise our positions by sharing items or knowledge.
---
The server population dropped to the dedicated few and the game got cancelled early on.  Oops.
---
Not that we were solely responsible; we were playing the game as it was designed, and we occasionally took people in.  OTOH, there was no tutorial and core mechanics that allowed for exponential power creep definitely didn't help.
---
Hence, I wonder if something similar would happen in EVE if everyone's stuff self destructed today.  Probably only the groups with strong out-of-game organization or identity would stay, and probably be mostly unaffected.
---
All my cyno toons are skill farms anyway. I just had to take a month off to skill into recons and back to skill farms they become.
---
I don't think eve is in maintenance mode but I gotta say the October patch notes were really light.  I'm hoping what that means there were some longer term things being worked on or stuff that was being held for release until they could be announced at Vegas but it is kinda concerning.  Thanks for taking your time to respond to people in this thread.
---
Honorbrawls and PvE, all that's really left of wspace. And evicting people then crying about dead space
---
Slope for the slope gods.
---
it me
---
I mean, he did tell form the beginning, that those are only his personal thoughts.     
---
It was curious how close the chaos changes were to his suggestions, but i wouldn't say we were to expect all of them implemented anyway.
---
You can always c2-null chad and feather nerds in ns and think your so elite
---
I'll dig up The Kill board links to them when I get home they've been pretty standard for a while
---
It's standard for any workplace tbh it's not like the devs in waterfall model have more say or something lol
---
Sadly, based on exooki’s presentation, what wormholers have always memed about is actually true. There was ONE dude in that room who even had an inkling how wormholes worked. And he proceeded to educate them for an embarrassingly long time.
---
It’s also scary, because now they may THINK they know how things work, and try breaking everything. The one thing most people asked exoo was to try and guide the changes in a way that isn’t completely catastrophic. Because oh boy there are changes coming.
---
I think its pretty obvious CCP just doesn't have any development manpower left at this point aside keeping things upright as is and tossing in a new ship or recycled PVE thing once in a while.
---
The company was sold for a reason folks. That reason is even when they *had the ability to actually change anything a few years ago*, they failed to. The result is a bad spot between just hanging on to what revenue they have and not having enough now to revitalize the franchise without worrying about the 15 year old PVE babies in null going away.
---
Honorbrawls best brawls mate. Dead space is a meme.
---
I don't really consider getting 90% of your content in kspace making you a wormhole corp. Although this is the opposite of most people's sentiment, which is "if you have something attackable in wspace, you're a wspace corp"
---
Riiiight, the game doesn’t need us but they stopped blackout sharpish. Calm down son.
---
Several years ago, Goonswarm was able to exploit the way Loyalty Points are paid out for killing rival faction warfare members to generate infinite LP: At the time, LP was paid based on a rolling 3-month average of the destroyed ship's value. By selling low-value but rarely-sold items to their alts at insane prices, they could jack up the average market price of said item. Destroying cheap ships containing these items would then be paid huge volumes of LP for what the game thought was an obscenely valuable item. This lasted about 2 weeks before it was caught and the profits removed.
---
I also remember an even earlier incident (possibly Apocrypha-era?) where an immediate post-patch bug caused dreadnoughts to fire every round loaded in their weapons in a single activation cycle - with appropriate damage done. As 0.0 Sovereignty at the time was determined by who had more POSes anchored in a system, this could understandably lead to serious issues. CCP got on it quickly, however - declaring it an exploit, warning that any sovereignty taken before it could be fixed would be reset, and then patching the bug within a day.
---
Been involved in more wars than 90% of the community.  This was an amazing war.  Fighting into someones dominant TZ with all the defensive advantages that defender gets.  Fights all the time with the war hinging on a razors edge for over 6 months.  It was so much fun.
---
I'll help you out.
---
Classic must be boring...
---
Seems like a really weird way to read that graph but ok sure whatever
---
K
---
An active rattle, with good skills, can do all C3 anoms in 10-12 mins with combat relic and data sites done in 15 max.
---
Yes they seem skewed. Because while you are sitting here screaming about NS nerfs your own CSM rep states clearly that he feels your space is the safest in the game. Whilst making a shitload more isk/capita than NS players.
---
You do understand that we might sit here and see that as people who have it better are trying to make it worse for others so they can enjoy their playstyle more. This doesnt seem like an issue?
---
And I dont know all your views but the shit that Ive read on this sub the last couple of months are stupid beyond belief. People have this notion of what it is to live in NS and base all their suggestions off of that. But we who actually live their understand the limitations of our umbrellas, we understand what the blackout means, we understand what cynos mean and so on. 
---
If you want meaningful change, you actually have to listen to us at some point. Otherwise all your suggestions will fall short because you dont understand those small details that make or break changes.
---
You could be benefitted from more farts :)
---
I sincerely doubt they'll change or do anything. If they do, it'll be "chAoS btW haHAA" instead of real change.
---
So one side whines to change the cap and the other dude has to figure it out?
---
Don't need to hit the nuclear button.
---
Imperium just need to wake up and take responsibility for their effect on the game.
---
They won, game died. Cool.
---
Stations that they also replaced didnt drop loot.
---
im laughing so hard,, yea i forget so many people just do null sec stuff. maybe i should null sec,, then again why stop doing what im enjoying. haha
---
But then how would you make any money?
---
Not a goon, I've linked and stated who I am many times but people like you only judge someone based on their group.
---
Now he has to risk something tangible if he wants to steal.
---
The drug abuse? Probably.
---
I’ve explained in a couple different comments how the concept of blackout is not bad, the execution was. Anyone that has a reasonable suggestion gets trolled/flamed by the nullsec meme brigade. It’s so numerous they just bury anything that doesn’t fit narrative.
---
Your suggestion about meaningful changes is my point about blackout. It was bad standalone yes. It needed cloak, cap, cyno, sov, and structure systems to all be largely redone before blackout would be feasible.
---
I’m not saying YOU hate new things. That was just me pointing out how ridiculous Dave-stark is in contradicting himself every other post. If you associate with him and his views and negative impact on the community, then yeah I was pointing at you too.
---
If you're in a dread, by the time the sig shows up it's too late and you're about to be tackled. Thus, adding scrams (and thereby encouraging running in dreads) to c5 sites would be a huge boon to wormhole pvp (and the nerf to pve that all wormholers have been asking for).
---
I mean, him saying 'personal thoughts' is a safe way of telegraphing upcoming changes to us unwashed masses. Not saying he was blatantly dishonest but the JF to Covert Cyno was so out of left field that it didn't surprise me much to see that being the initial adjustment for the cyno change.
---
Because you are restricting peoples movements in every other place. Just like the cyno is a shitty change that just breaks ten more things than it fixes.
---
The problem right now is that people in drone ships use them right? Then just make another penalty for that. Boom, your issue is solved without breaking other things.
---
I mean these guys keep finding new problems and "radical" solutions to them. What you are saying is the only viable approach to this problem.
---
Lol, thats cute:)
---
It was a stupid change but I honestly think it was more in line with "harming" the vets more than anything.
---
Got a question for you bud, do you think that people stating concerns on the eve subreddit are "fake news" or otherwise invalid?  Personally I don't think that eve is a good choice long term for the majority new people looking into the game.
---
The play styles I fell in love with when I started really diving into Eve online are long gone due to deliberate design decisions from the developer and the aggregation of players into ever more massive entities.
---
I personally have of course adapted and run a reasonably competent group of doods in one of the very few blob free regions of the game, but even our gameplay has devolved in prescheduled f1 fleets far more often than I ever would have wanted or hoped for.  However the stuff I'd rather be doing is just utterly gone from the game.
---
I think my opinion is largely in line with the person you replied to above. And, that if I were talking to a younger version of myself, i'd suggest not getting into the game as it currently stands.
---
Was sad to see it end but it seems WC ran out of gas.
---
Oh, absolutely. That's basically what i was trying to say there. Just with the little disclaimer he included.
---
To be fair you are probably some line member that has never done anything other than press F1.  But heefuckinghaw you got a reddit account so you're gonna take your 63 IQ big brain and armchair general the fuck out of shit huh?  Neverstoposting
---
what if the coalition didn't start infighting after taking space? it seems like if a coalition starts infighting right after victory that the chances of that coalition ever forming again are pretty slim. why would anyone leave their home in hopes of fighting for a new home with a group who will likely attack you right after you take your new home?
---
Great point  :) Id love to see that PICC if a dev changed the scope 50% of the way through the project
---
Please tell me more about these "evenly matched fleets" and simple facts.

---
These were just a few I found as I am sure there are others, be aware I know we (PL) were in Detorid as well trying to make these "evenly matched fleets" closer to being truth.
---
I like how you berate him about it as well when you are doing your best to make sure more these supposedly "evenly matched fleets" never happen again.   I love the 'game at its finest' you mean making sure there are unassailable states/groups in Eve so there will be less conflicts and making sure your new allies AoM turn our server into their server that is effectively dead?
---
Dozens of people will get the ban hammer!
---
WC hosted an invasion against Legacy last year where PL + SKILLU+TRI+NC took part in.  They showed perfectly they were a hostile neighbor who at the time of the war last year had the stated goal of killing TAPI. So it wasn't some fake narrative. WC were a threat on the border and had to be taken out.
---
CCP sold itself. It's dead. Eve is dead. Sad times
---
And yet, our CSM rep had to spend twice his allotted time explaining basic concepts because our space is not understood by the entirety of the rest of CSM nor CCP. There are also a lot of “wormholers” who don’t actually know how our space works either.
---
You can take headline snippets like “WHs safer than Null sec!” If you like. The actual details are a little more complex than that. Did you know that our guesstimated 1-3% of playerbase destroyed 10% of the isk in game in wormholes last year? There’s a lot of great metrics for how healthy Wspace actually is if you’d take the time to look. In the survey exoo took before CSM one of the highest requested new features was an increased spawn rate for wandering wormholes. Because, as anyone that fights in wormholes, wanderers are one of the main content drivers and we don’t have nearly enough connectivity. More connectivity means more encounters, more fights, more explosions. You can’t prepare for wanderers.
---
Further expanding on “WH space safe” It’s because almost all C6 and huge amounts of C5 have been turned into bear holes. There’s almost zero content to be generated from them. They aren’t even loot piñatas. But, they do output a large amount of isk. This is because, effectively, CCP has broken site profitability in home holes. Almost every wormhole player generates their isk from their static (if they don’t have a bear hole), which carries a bit more risk and also limits your cap usage for sites. I just realized how long this has gotten, if you want more details, let me know.
---
But this is what I mean, I understand them being rarer. And CCP jumping on them immediately. But how has a glitch like that (complete market crash sort of size) never been found?
---
oh yeah... say it... call me low class trash! oh yeah...
---
Thing is, the cyno change is actually really bad for the roaming gangs. We can still light cynos, in fact now we are forced to do it more sneakily with recons. But now we pretty much always know if the other side can do the same. So we can drop with less fear.
---
All in all, it actually became safer for null blocs.
---
Wow that escalated quickly, guess I better take it from someone who "has been in more wars that 90% of players" lmao. I tried the null Bloc life for all of a couple weeks before I realized how fucking retarded everyone was and how shit the fleets are. But yeah keep jerking off in all my posts about how ToTaLlY AwESoMe "wars"in eve are
---
I appreciate her passion for the game. But oh boy, did citadels/upwell structures fuck our game.      
---
That and the rorqual changes where the really bad things happening to eve.     
---
Injectors were just the cherry on top imo.
---
lmao holy shit you believe this
---
They’re going to implement changes mate, I can tell you. They’re going to give NS a rest for now and maybe practice some Balancing for wormholes first.
---
Because the actual runners are doing a bunch of tricky multiboxing and micro with a pile of supers while Chori is sitting in his cloaked 200m hauler ready to click 2 buttons.
---
I don’t know man...maybe he agreed with you somewhere, but most posts he is trolling from what it looks like to me. When the cyno changes were proposed I agreed they were not in the right direction. There are a lot of different ideas I liked, but limiting cynos to recons was not good.
---
Regarding the “nice suggestions” there wasn’t a lot of productive discussion that I remember. There were some people throwing ridiculous shot around from both sides, but mostly I saw one and two word responses from those opposed, not opinions or debates. This is where I think CCP messed up. They needed to go back improve the systems I’ve mentioned and then come back after maybe a year and propose blackout again. Saying that I’m realizing that what they needed was someone to actually sit down and write out a road map or plan for people to get behind, and then the community would have time to actually debate and give feedback. Instead there were basically two weeks of panic and memes, a couple kills, and then silence.
---
There's no objectively "best thing". Some people preferred eve during  blackout. The game simply has a lot more krabs than pvp players in nullsec and something had to give.
---
So VINDI is committing suicide by reset. No way Winter Co lets them keep Cache when Legacy is already talking about wanting to push into WC/SP/Insmother.
---
Your landscape/culture hasn’t changed in the last two years mate, regardless of the VNI “nerf”. Whether it’s a myrm, VNI, Ishtar, gila they’re all the same thing. It’s boring. I didn’t feel like listing all the new alternate VNI replacements, but I have here so that you can follow along. Has this helped you? The fellow I was having a conversation clearly understood that I didn’t specifically mean VNIs explicitly.
---
"other than the last two weeks" ok vily bud
---
You realise most of the people you call krabs also PVP? Why do people continue with this bullshit as if they are some superior elite pvp god. Most people in null will PVP/roam etc.
---
Stations had disableable services and didn't give you a week to evac
---
A screenshot? ZKill is a thing ya know.
