God forbid you need a single recon with you to apply like everybody else.
---
Wtf is Albion online? Lol
---
In wormholes they do https://zkillboard.com/kill/68310404/
---
Neuts will deal with it. Stratios can kill them effectively with a neut heavy fit
---
What if your small corporation had a mining op, and during that OP you had scouts / a defense fleet? Imagine using those small tools, how much isk you could save in lost excavators.
---

---
I would consider pinging discord, or starting a thread on your forums to schedule something like this. It is a capital mining vessel after all- your corp should be there to support you. No need to join a bigger alliance, just utilize some of the tools at your disposal :)
---
&gt;small renter
---
That is because renters are 3rd class citizens. You're literally just funding the blocks you don't like people grouping into for space they didn't want. Try being an actual PVP alliance rather than renters :)
---
No, I’m a very old account and after waiting awhile the full pack was delivered to my account including the Omega. Hope this helps! :)
---
No need to can your alt. Just make sure it’s linked to Steam. :D
---
Learning to manually pilot and doing it well (or at least not bad) made me feel like I graduated to a new level in EVE.
---
In particular we used to fight a very blobby group of nubs. They weren't talented but would bring 20 guys vs 2, and likely wouldn't take the fight w/o those odds.
---
Anyhow me and a skilled corpie are in kite-tristans in a novice plex in Gallente space when we see the nubs balling up on gate. He asks, "are we doing this?". I say, "may as well"...
---
They slide, it's a solid 10-15 guys in mostly mwd fit executioners. So we pull range, drop drones, start calling targets and focusing fire. String them out, feather, cycle drones...
---
They reships once or twice before finally bailing on the site, leaving us two tristans in a graveyard of T1 frigs...
---
It was both hilarious and glorius.
---
&gt; As the incident included a Molok sold by Dark to a Snuff guy that got confiscated.
---
There had been attempts to sell that molok for months prior, So i'm doubtful that whatever happened included that. (Unless CCP jumped the gun and made the link and never followed up properly, But i don't know.)
---
I’m faced with an impossible task.
---
Basically, I’m an F2P player. EVE just made a starter pack free which includes a week of Omega.
---
I heard that if you’re Omega, you can train the battleship skills and have them available in alpha clone state! I REALLY want a battleship! All the time I have to get this is my week long period, and the clock’s already ticking.
---
Only issue is that buying the skill will cost me 13 million ISK, and totals about 25 million for all the prerequisites as well. I have a week minus training time to get this money.
---
HELP! How do I make this money quickly?!? This week is probably all I’ll ever get and I’d like to grab the most useful stuff I can to use as an alpha player; namely, battleships. This will allow me to fully experience the game despite being F2P.
---
Thanks! :D
---
How many alts Olmeca have ?
---
Once during a structure bash there was a wrek 2200 Km away. I thought it was meters and hit the open wrek. For some reason my BS warped to the wrek.
---
FC didn't primary me at least. 
---
Can confirm, gotta get everything, including meta mods.
---
No amount of scouting can see the other end of a wormhole that 50 Inner Hell Drekavacs are about to pour through.
---
I like all the proof. Sounds nice and possible though, but requires a lot of work to make happen.
---
My body is ready.
---
Messaged and confirmed
---
I'm sorry, but i'm under the impression that the second someone leaves wormhole, they appear in local. I would assume that a scout from the wormhole comes first- which could easily be scouted, or kept at bay with bubbles :)
---
How dare you meme about tapi like that
---
You do know there is already a Black hole type, right?
---
To be fair, if it's a fleet large enough to threaten the rorqual, it's going to take more than a small defense fleet to hold it back 5 minutes.  
---
If you can't guarantee winning the fight, OP's better bet would be to have a DST standby to haul them out.
---
The promptly imploded soon after for some reason. It seemed like NC leadership did everything they could to hamstring Laz and Polaris.
---
Honestly the fix for carriers is to allow bombers. Carriers get acceptable dps vs structures and other caps but are still killable as they dont get super carrier dps due to less wings andstill shit tank compared to them.
---
I'm not suggesting a head on fight. Instead, delay- with bubbles and skirmish until the rorqal can safely extract. That should be easy enough to do in 99.9% of cases
---

Keep your small thoughts to yourself.
---
You disappoint me mate.
---
You should click automatic updates on sphere friend.
---
The dream.
---
For 5 minutes?  You're joking, right?
---
Maybe, MAYBE it works once, when the attackers think you're holding them for a good fight, and stick around.  Once they find out you're delaying to save a rorqual, they'll just burn tackle ahead.
---
Shit a number of groups do this already.  Ceptors do this well.
---
Lets stop pretending RUSROG is this amazing spy master
---
?
---
How else did PL get out of UALX?
---
Yes, that's correct, but if the time between the scout(s) popping out of the wormhole and a Rorqual being bubbled is less than the remaining time on that Rorqual's core cycle, there's nothing you can do to save that Rorqual other than to win the fight against their main fleet.
---
Care to share this wonderful information with us?
---
Nah, if you read his I'm innocent post he said he had no idea. Obviously fake news, corrupt media
---
So you're telling me you can't stop a single dictor? I'm hoping that your standing fleet op has fast tackle, and bubbles on in gates. Can you explain how it could get through so quickly?
---
Yeah the fact he said that makes me think this is actually Jay Marcadie posting again...
---
Achkchyually it was released by ESO
---
Assuming this is who I think it is, you aren't dropping some huge revelation. Polaris wasn't infallible nor was the people in charge of it. The merit of the most efficient spy program is that only one or two people know what the organization was. Polaris was compromised on a few occasions and it led to the burn of quite a few agents. Laz's system also worked terribly because he pulled his agents from members of the alliances. This led to multiple recruits being double agents. Long story short, the best thing to come out of Polaris, was the chat logs and the ease of implanting double agents
---
MU-RPH
---
Ceptors get stomped on by rorqual light drones, and a few RLML / LMML ships. No problem. If indeed, you start cycle, as a scout jumps into your system from a worm hole that spawns there- then yah, you're fucked. Nothing in eve is completely safe- but by following the tips I just provided, you can make it almost 100% secure.
---
wormholer btw
---
You're saving 3 out of 5 of your drones still. You're literally only putting 1.4b more on the line then you were on April 8th...
---
Bubbles aren't saving you from a double hyperspatial stiletto.
---
Passing on nda information, even if you aren't bound by the nda or tskinf advantage of that info, gets you a year ban. It's happened before, so there's already precedent for that situation
---
You've exhausted that
---
How does a sig bloomed letto survive on grid long enough with rorqu light drones, and a single jackdaw to hold it for a dictor / fleet?
---
I know this is an RL reference, but please don't touch wormhole space CCP, everything you've touched in the last few years has broken it. Wormholes are the only old EVE left.
---
Surprisingly well as it happens, I have a friend who flies said stilettos.
---
"Double agents" weren't really a problem since most people recruited simply provided automated access. Once the system worked the "agent" didn't really need to do anything beyond just keeping their computer on. Some handlers did develop relationships with their recruits and carried out some actions. But those recruited had no access (or at least mine did not) to anything on our end.
---
gl 7o
---
I'm speaking on the few that were recruited for live or active fleet intel and fed misinformation intentionally
---
At least I know it's never too early to quit EVE
---
Cool, can I see the stilletto fit that can actually do that? What if they have a caracal instead? That's some serious DPS application
---
Do not go gentle into that good night
---
The ceptors don't have to hold the target, they have to confirm where it is.  Bubbles hold the target.  
---
If you actually have the numbers to identify an enemy multiple jumps out, put forces in their way to delay their arrival, and have subcaps on grid to protect the rorqual from tackle, then I'd argue you probably are not in a small corp.
---
Loved the soundtrack choice.
---
Yeah...for that kind of thing it was better to use "in-house" people for it.
---
Pretty cool character.
---
The wormhole can spawn in any system, including the one that the rorqual is mining in. This has happened to us multiple times. All the scout(s) have to do is to d-scan down which anomaly or moon we're in and they're good to go. Or they could use combat probes and land right on top of the rorqual. Both take less than 1 minute.
---
Steam sales lagging on the target.
---
It's really easy, I do it all the time... You're also adding onto the scenario but whatever. I'm never alone for more than 30 seconds, I have 2-3 stilettos out hunting each hole and a sabre sitting on the inside waiting, which is also double hyperspatial. Literally the first stiletto pulls the RoRqUaL PiLoTs drones off and the other two hold point while the sabre comes in drops two bubbles, reloads and cloaks. It takes no less than 3 minutes. One 30seconds to 1 minute later DPS is landing on grid and clears your bullshit jackdaw or caracal.
---
Of course that can happen, nothing in eve is 100% safe. However, even then - assuming you have a small defense fleet formed and at your rorqual (RLML / LML ships) they can't hold point long enough before you can warp out.
---
Of course, if you get the bad luck to be just starting a cycle when this happens, then yah- you might die. But nothing in eve is 100% safe- sorry about that.
---
[deleted]
---
They're not holding point through, they drop bubbles. Even if you kill them, you can't kill the bubble.
---
Is there a way to change the mouse sensitivity?
---
I've had mouse issues with EVE Online since it was first released, and it's kept me from playing the game ever since.  
---
I sometimes drop in now and then to see if they've added it, but so far the answer seems to be no.
---
So I'm wondering if there's a way to perhaps modify some game files to adjust the sensitivity?
---
And oh, please don't suggest that I change my mouse DPI or Windows mouse sensitivity.  
---
I'd have to manually lower it when I'm turning the camera, then manually turn it back up when I'm navigating the menus.
---
Here's an example of how bad it is for me: [http://hezkore.com/junk/2019-04-11\_02-53-27.mp4](http://hezkore.com/junk/2019-04-11_02-53-27.mp4)
---
Friend of ours. Was in my Corp when they left the game, SD'd everything on the undock of our Fortizar
---
Wow, that's a great system you have there. I'm curious though- about two things
---
1. You describe 'burning your inty off'. Does that mean out of point range, letting the rorq go? What if the rorq pilot just recalls his drones?
---
2. I also noticed that in your story, there isn't a single jackdaw / caracal sitting near the rorqual defending it, what happens then?
---
3. I like how you have your dictors hypered, and ready to go. That's good thinking- but again, what if the enemy has preset bubbles on the in and out gates? Don't your sabers have to burn through it?
---
Really interested to hear your process, as it seems you're very good.
---
but what about bob
---
You really make it hard to poopandpee
---
I approve of this reference
---
Right, so if they drop a bubble, what's stopping you from MJDing out of it?
---
Also, if you think about it- they have to land within 20K of your rorqual to drop a bubble. Why don't you just have a tactical warp in for your rorqual, that way- nothing can warp to your anom at 0 and land at yo. If you can make them burn to your rorqual (after they land at 0 on the anom) , you then have time to kill them :)
---
He was referring to Goons.
---
Now this is a bait post.
---
before people started getting swatted*
---
I think you’re dumb or dunno what wh groups are doing.
---
they roll null statics and appear on your head suddenly
---
with multiple tacklers.
---
once their hyper sabre drops bubble, there is no chance to escape unless you’re competent super pilot that can bomb bubble on your top.
---
wh groups are better in what they’re doing than you think.
---
So setting up some bubbles on the in and out gates, and then just having a few caracals / jackdaws sitting near your capital is what only large corps can do? I would think with a few dual box and about 3/5 people you have more than enough manpower :)
---
I get the feeling your making this more complex than I'm trying to describe. Killing a single dictor should be no problem for a few jackdaw / caracal. Assuming the dictor doesn't land at zero on the rorqual (it never should be able too if you have a tactical ping)- i would make the argument that you're pretty safe :)
---
You don't have to use 5 excavators.
---
Has to be trolling, no one is that much shit.
---
He should have told CCP not darkshines lol. He is just as guilty and deserves it.
---
I understand that some people are really good at this game. But I also understand, that unless the wormhole spawns in the same system as the rorqual, these scary wormholers will need to take gates. If they are taking gates, they should be scoutable (rorqual can run)- and assuming the bubbles I have mentioned are in place, it will delay everything that isn't an interceptor.
---
Interceptors should be forced off with a few caracals / jackdaws / the rorqs own light drones. Once they are forced off, again the rorqual should just warp out.
---
What am I missing here?
---
&gt;thread closed for ranting
---
There goes my breaktime entertainment for the night.
---
Yeah I thought this was a skyrim meme at first and got excited
---
What a great fucking read. Thanks for documenting what I imagine was an exhilarating ordeal.
---
My corp has killed 23 rorquals using three stilettos facing all sorts of different adversity to make initial tackle. 9/10 you're in indy core, I can literally sit in a on grid ping and just align to you and wait for you to either pick up speed or just look at you to see if you're coming out of Indy. Did you know most rorqual pilots fit drone navs? The light drones literally move so fast they can't even apply to a stiletto, and the rorqual pilots just leave their inefficiently fast drones on the stiletto the whole time... A single jackdaw or caracal is not going to push three stilettos off before heavy tackle and DPS comes. How long do you think it takes for my DPS to land on grid? If the Rorqual is in the WH system my DPS fleet in there within 2 minutes. All of my DPS ships have MJDs to avoid the capital hammer, I can literally just MJD through your bubble fuckery. Bubbles and jackdaws and bullshit rapid light I'm in reload half the fight caracals aren't the answer kiddo.
---
Gotta keep that Shiny Caracal ready huh? I've alwats liked the Brave guys. They're blue with our alliance. I had though about joining up before, but found a good home else where. Unfortunately, in order to make enough isk to cover big losses, you need multiple accounts. Ive only got 3 personally. But, 2 rorq + fax is similar isk on field and isk/hr as 1 hel and 1 scout. But thats where the money is. I gotta pay for all those shiny toys i loose pvping.
---
Wrong. It may have negatively affected small alliances. However it is definitely easier to kill them wherever you go even in spod central.

I know, I don't. But people flying under supercapital umbrellas can safely mine with all 5, because they know they're probably not going to lose their rorqual. So the effect of this nerf for rorquals in Delve was only a 20% mining yield nerf, but if I have to use 3/5 excavators now it's going to be a a 40% nerf (2/5) on top of that 20% nerf, so about 50% total.
---
Nah, the beta is super unstable. It tried to convince me that init had a future.
---
&gt;why bring a carrier to a cap brawl anymore?
---
Because defanging is still a thing.
---
&gt;why bring a carrier to a subcap brawl anymore?
---
Because webs are still a thing.
---
stop. there's already been 1 blackhole discovered we don't need to cause another.
---
Anyone heard of Kraken? Current release is 3.7.
---
What cerebral accelerator is it? +6? 
---
And can you trade it to another char?
---
I think you don’t know anything about what’s going on.
---
Most wh groups(at least I’ve seen) don’t like to gate much, so they are not scoutable or at least there is no time to unsiege if you’re not really lucky.
---
Hyper sabre/intys warps really fast than you can think, and wh groups are one of best group in ‘shotgun’ to anomalies and sync their tacklers.
---
Especially If you’re in renter group, wh groups tend to have blue scouts in every renter alliance so It is worse.
---
Lol. No shit sherlock. But, one party (republicans) is certainly more hell bent on fucking poor people anally no lube than the other. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a moron.
---
soooo we cant add EVE to steam and login to existing account to to get these? so many conflicting comments
---
No idea. It was years ago. Many. Have to check next time I am near my pc
---
I’m sure you never tried to kill good dictors outside of F1 jackdaw/caracool fleet.
---
Wow you do have experience 23 is a whole lot! Do you mind if i throw a few more questions your way?
---
1. I was wondering if i can ask you- you mention 'pinging'. So then you're losing tackle, and warping away? What stops the rorqual from cynoing out at this point? If i recall correctly- you don't need any velocity at all?
---
2. With just lettos, how do you stop the rorqual from refitting of a depot, or using an MJD?
---
3. And I wanted to ask- assuming the rorqual was properly fit, and piloted... can you really keep an inty around it? I certainly understand that drones moving too fast are always going to be a problem, but what about acolytes?
---
4. So I need to understand this, you tribox lettos, and move them all into the same system, at the same time? Isn't that a bit inefficient? But just because i want to understand your system- let's say you do have 3X going to the same system. How can you tribox these lettos against a caracal+jackdaw+rorqual light drones? They'll die so quickly! What's your fit?
---
5. Are you an AT pilot? Because man if what you're saying is real- you're fucking top tier at this game. How do normal every day pilots have a chance at emulating your techniques, and getting a roqual kill of their own?
---
Ohh ok ok, I think I'm beginning to see your point now- let me know if I'm starting to get the right idea
---
1. If you're in a renter alliance, you're spy'd on- and therefore every time you're out in space, someone knows.
---
2. Every time you do enter into an anom, there is a very likely chance, that a wormhole will spawn in your system.
---
3. That worm hole will have an entire fleet sitting on the other side ready to go.
---
4. Even though a ship warps fast, RLML ships and large bubbles on gates can't stop or even slow them down.
---
Am I starting to understand your point? While i admit to not being the best player- it seems to me that some of your assertions seem a bit... far fetched. I think it's unlikely for this to happen regularly haha
---
&gt; Gotta keep that Shiny Caracal ready huh?
---
I actually typically fly a Hecate to probe down runners and bait stuff into agressing on gates.
---
But it's going to be months before i could fly a cap competently on my main let alone on any alts i could setup. I don't even have the startup ISK for such a project. No idea how you guys do it.
---
remember when eve was a game where people didn't assume everything was meant to start as 100% safe?
---
Good content as ever, keep it up
---
Because maybe capitals are for fighting capitals. Use your 5 accounts in subs? I bet you will have better results or... just die to his gang anyways.
---
I feel this is a cringe eye jerk troll post imo
---
Cool retard
---
Okay retard
---
Not exactly what you’re asking, but a friend and I tested a hel with t2 dromis and 2 faction tracking link mods and fibos were 3 shorting a stiletto, 2 shot a Sabre, and 2 shot a cheapish fit retri. You just have to fit them properly and you should be fine still.
---
I doubt the lights are part of the ship. They're likely just there as part of the construction of it.
---
It was pretty accurate when reporting mine IRL
---
I ran out of popcorn :(
---
Never flew a carrier in my life and I know that is one shitfit for any situation.
---
I'd also like an official answer to this.
---
this is incredibly trivial stuff from the programming side. some programs that log into a whole bunch of open-standards comms servers and copy-paste messages to a different network. that's it. IRC relay bots existed decades before eve.
---
the more interesting questions to ask yourself are: what good does having a ticker of everyone else's broadcasts do? why were none of the people who were being spied on particularly worried? why were PL the ones who put the effort into making this system?
---
You can smartbomb bubbles. An imp navy large EM smartbomb will kill a bubble in 3 cycles if I'm not mistaken.
---
Once you grind into your first rorq or carrier, it gets a bit easier to make piles of money. I took about half the isk for the ore i mined for 4-5 months to invest in injectors for the second rorq pilot and both of them to get a fax pilot injected. Straight cold trained my main for carriers though. Fighters V is a bitch lol.
---
Ye good hole roll is not always there and It’s matter of pure luck.
---
Personally I think there is no reason to be in renter after some nerfs anyway and idk why they’re not join big nullsec blocs like goons even they require very minimum PVP activity...
---
But they have the point that recent roq nerf hurts small groups than big groups, which is completely right.
---
Back in... fuck,forgot how long it was, I was in IRC and we got into a war with greedy RA and SOLAR. We were kind pets of XIX but they stabbed us in the back, but we gave a damn nice good fight and steamrolled RA, who were also in the middle of a civil war. Goons joined in at this point, though, so we saw the writing in the wall and started moving out, we no longer had any chance.
---
On last few days of war, though, with IRC fully now in retreat mode and extracting assets, one dude in BLUEP found a unanchoring POS which we had intel  had at least 3 supers that were sometimes left there floating unattended hours till POS was fueled in and someone noticed. At the time I had already found a few carriers in unfueled RA POS’s (due to civil war, no one was fueling them I guess), so they invite me in. We prep everything, we stalk the POS for a few days, RA super ratters notice I dont bother them, so they keep ratting in peace, so they kept leaving the supers floating in the POS... one morning they leave 2 archons floating there for 2 hours, they talk in local about it, blame each other in local about it, but we dont move, we stay true to the supers objective, so they fuel the POS again.
---
Three days later, I wake up, right after DT, login my eyes in local and POS is all of the sudden is offline, dunno why. 2 Aeons and 1 Nyx on it, 1 Obelisk, and a single RA guy in a Slasher. I shout at everyone, they all login, cyno chain up in 5 minutes on prepped hidden Death Star PoS, alts come to system and board the supers. Slasher dude panics and jumps on the Obelisk. We try to kill him... but we cant: supers had no drones and one of the Aeons not even had fuel. Obelisk warps away, we jump out 2 supers, 1 aeon is left behind and logoff in SS (which we later extracted with the help of one RA coup dudes). 
---
We were 5 dudes, so one of us buys 2 supers at market price, minus cost of DS POS which he payed. We agree, we split profit, but 2 of the 4 remaining stop playing EVE due to rl, so all isk is split into 2, and one is me. 3rd super? Boarded by my alt,  but I unsubbed for 5 years, forgot pw and account name, CCP helps me recover it, and had to create a 3rd account, train it into T2 industrials, setup a POS, move it to drone regions and sent more fuel to 2nd account, to be then safely sent to low sec where it was given to trusted 3rd party for its sale.
---
Never pve’d since then.

[It's time to stop](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/155/834/plz-stop-post.jpg)
---
I actually have tried to do that! Can you tell me how a good dictor can stay within 20K of a rorqual when there is a few RLML / Jackdaws there? Assuming you don't land at zero- how exactly do you even burn into range against 60+K ranged application missiles?
---
Even if you do manage to pop one bubble- then cloak, what stops the rorqual from MJDing out?
---
Isn't that basically asking for an eviction? If the rest of eve dislikes Rorq mining this much I can't imagine what wormholers think of it.
---
The rorqual can actually use an MJD beacon to boosh itself! So you don't even need a CMD :)
---
Usually "something to kill". Evictions happen (usually) when one group royally pisses off the other. As long as you aren't a cubt and bring content, you're generally safe from eviction
---
It does have boosters on its rear end so it's definitely a capital ship, not a citadel.
---
oh yeah. i reply to your thread and then like 10 minutes later am meeting with a sherrifs deputy that plays eve lmao
---
That's cool and all, but could you answer some of my questions please? I really appreciate your conjecture and all that, but I'm trying to get to a point where I can do the hunting, would really appreciate if you wouldn't mind answering those questions! Other than 'luck' or try hard rolling, how is there a 'definite' way to catch them?
---
I was working on it, using my explo money to get injectors to inch closer. It was working and then they massively increased the cost of the books for carriers right before i could get them and nerfed carriers a bunch so i abandoned it and have been training Torpedos V for a rattlesnake instead.
---
Basically a supercapital ship larger than the titans currently used by capsuleers.
---
They have multiple tacklers and know how to bounce between tactical points
---
Maybe this will be not even matter considering their main fleet will arrive under 2 minute mark after initial tackle.
---
It does have engines/boosters on its back.
---
None of these kills refit into something decent. Actually all but 1 of those still have all 5 excavators in their cargo bay so the nerf to the excavator's size didn't affect them at all.
---
nah this isn't AT, this is like a minor league tourney. Still fun, but no where near as competitive.
---
Ohh ok, so instead of jumping into a system with 1 tackle, or sending your multiboxed tackle to different systems, you send them all- at the same time into the same system?

Even with 3 inties- how can you keep point against a few RLML ships? You keep mentioning 'lettos'- so I assume you shield tank them with a MSE? What happens when they run out of buffer? Durring the pinging, how do you manage to continuously hold point on the rorqual- when all it needs to do is cyno out? Or it can re-fit to all stabs, and still cyno out under a disruptor.
---
I'm really interested in your methods, as you seem to be the only one here who has actual experience doing what I really want to try and do some day. Im just trying to fully understand your methods!
---
Oh good to know.  
---
Though, if you a command dessy capable alt I'd still say its a good idea to have one since it can also boosh away any dictors that may try to cloak up on grid next to the rorq.
---
Can I come to dinner?
---
Put the fuel in the fuel bay, then open the fitting window and online the modules.
---
Like you did before, dock and begin the man the structure, open the inventory and deposit the fuel in the correct bay, once you've put enough in there to turn on the services, open up your fitting window and begin turning on the services , the initial onlining of each service will cost much more than the regular daily fuel consumption so ensure you have enough. You will get a notification a short time later letting you know your structure is back online.

A bit over two years ago I was doing some PvE in Cloud Ring when the call for backup came in from some corpmates under attack. It turned out that BjornBee and a few others were flying through our space, hunting and streaming. I hopped in a Keres and stupidly flew straight into his Deimos (I sucked at tackle PvP then, and still do), and got [destroyed](https://zkillboard.com/kill/58695950/) immediately. It was so embarrassing that he started making fun of me on the stream, which, fair.
---
But I managed to hold him long enough for the calvary to arrive, and his smug was [short-lived](https://zkillboard.com/kill/58696030/). My fifteen seconds of fame, and all it cost me was a little dignity and one T2 frig.

I got them to rename the Ld-Acid battery to Pb-Acid

A well fit tengu for running c3 anom solo will be fit for neut pressure. While it isn't too hard to neut a site runner out, one must also consider that electronic warfare tends to catch agro, so tanking the site+tengu is a possibility. 
---
So timing is pretty important is what I'm saying I guess. Last engagement I had in that situation was strat + mael and while I ended up popping drugs to tank mael, they fucked off after rat agro switched. C3 anoms ain't no joke

The programming side IS trivial. The organization, network and people coordinating is the real relevant stuff. This post could have been made by literally any of our clients using our services. It really reads like something Jay Marcadie would have posted here to seem like he's "spilling the beans" on something. (He's not.) Jay was a client and former diplo for xdeathx. His incompetence is basically what led to his removal from his diplo position, me scamming him out of a nice bit of pocket change (16 bil) and then NCdot going overboard facilitating the collapse of the DRF.  
---
Having a chatroom ping of every major alliance and what they are doing provides an instant snapshot of what is going on in Eve. In and by itself it's not useful. If you know how to make use of those things it is. Also "PL" wasn't the ones who put effort in it. Technically it was NCdot, specifically Lazuli Loto and the team around him.

Watching sovereign citizens attempt to defend themselves in a courtroom is... interesting. And by interesting I mean that it usually results in the defendant needing to be escorted out due to not being mentally fit to stand trial.

What ships do you fly now? T1 abyssals can be run in T1 cruisers like the Caracal or the Vexor and yield a few million per run (and much more if you get lucky). Can you fly those?

Awesome! Thank you fellas. That has been bugging me for a little bit now.

Double agents were a constant problem, it's a running joke basically. They constantly gave out way too much access because of the centralized structure of it.

Well obviously it was disgusting. we logged in, activated hack and jumped to our fort before we even materialized, literally there was just no time to do anything else.

Don't forget the mining. Multiboxing mining shit now required to actually complete events or get any accelerators. CCP is inviting you to pay for extra sub.

Honestly, it's not really a nerf. The change Just forces carrier and super pilots to do what they should have been doing anyway; cycling the NSA. It was never a problem in my Hel to keep the NSA running all the time. My niddhoggur fit is even cap stable at 32% with everything running and its not jew fit. I don't remember the EHP but I think its close to 3 million.  But, as long as you cycle the NSA (just set auto-repeat off), which is a good idea anyway, you should fit to keep the capacitor close to 75%. Its really doing nothing after everything is locked up. After running a 3-5 sites, i realized my ticks weren't hurt, and its only a few more clicks. Don't let the NSA change keep you out of carriers.
---
Of course not- im talking about the deployable mjd becon. Rorqual can deploy and use them :) i think that before writing off me or my ideas, you should try them out. I have a feeling i might know a thing or two about game mechanics!

Dude, have you ever tried hunting rorquals before? You're making this seem way more complicated than it is. It is a giant, slow aligning capital ship, potentially controlled by someone who is half, or fully afk, and it is locked into place for 5 minutes at a time. You say he's expecting "AT pilot level of skill" but you seem to be applying that same idea to the rorquals pilot as well, making no mistakes at any point in this storyline.

1. It is easier to kill excavators everywhere now, even under big supercap umbrellas. People will suicide frigates and dessies to get those 800 mil killmails and it's easier to finds excavators to kill in regions known to have abundance population of them, rather than renter space.

will you hold my nose for me then ;)
---
The short answer is no.
---
The long answer is it'll take you a while to catch up, but after about a year you'll be just about as capable as anyone else. If you stick around that long, you'll already know whether or not you like Eve and can thus decide how much you want to commit to it.
---
It's a lot of fun, but please PLEASE don't let a corp, group, or blob try to force you to do something you don't want. The newbro corps present in most major bloc alliances are not a permanent home and you do not have to be there if you do not want to. Instead of quitting if you don't enjoy that kind of gameplay, join a smaller corp instead! They could use the help.

This was actually two fleets. The crabs and the harpy ref fleet.  You def whooped our asses 7v20 vs the crabs. But for some stupid reason the fc for the harpies desided to ditch us and the easy kills on grid over warping to the defanged carrier and they ended up failing the kill at 8% hull.

Interesting. Who was the main client of this system, the FCs or the diplos? For the people in NC who made it (and whicherver PL).

&gt; Also "PL" wasn't the ones who put effort in it. Technically it was NCdot, specifically Lazuli Loto and the team around him.

I like the use of technically there.

---
Thinking really it was 8 lowsec players vs 2 Goon players...
---
You got a good point. Also lmls don’t do that much with few numbers against inty/dictors because you can warp out anyway. There is reason renter roquals fits multiple wcs and drone navs instead of tank.
---
Maybe you will dissapoint but what you must understand is renters are very bottom in terms of PVP, even sov null ppls barely can light cyno and PANIC in panic, have 0 experience in small scale pvp.
---
So It is not that incredible job, renter defence fleet takes ages to undock, and even tackled roqual dunno can’t do even half of what should he do. Even they managed to get few ship for save their roquals...It’s easy to keep tackle, even under multiple rlml ships.
---
I think you’re experienced player in small scale pvp, and also I think you’re overestimating crabs PVP ability because you have decent skill.
---
I am still the second most prolific killer of Lumio's after Vargrin. Get on my level scrub! /s

init are retarded but honestly this is pretty low effort, idea fine execution needs work

Sounds about right. Bot Harpys FTL.

Why did you not unanchor the keepstar and pick it up with a freighter and haul your stuff to an NPC station?
---
If the corp did not take it, then where would it be now anyways?
---
low effort bait
---
Messaging you to save your information since I am thinking about getting back into Eve. I only played for a couple months and really didn't learn much. I only have about 3.5 mil SP. I am interested in exploration and like a scout type stuff(if y'all even have that). But I'm also down to do anything as long as it's with people because playing alone kinda sucks.
---
Bro I find it amazing everquest is dead

Maybe the empire's don't, but Frat does.

And Infensus is renting in Fountain?

Then yes, let the holy flames burn across that wretched land!

If I can contribute for glorious Amarr, let me know!
---
Totally. Log off your character. Apply to a Corp that owns that sov then jump your carrier to the nearest fort. Log off till the app is accepted. If its goons log into an alpha character and explain the situation. You're not getting it out off null any other way without dying
---
bring things to it with an alt
---
You spelled Groon wrong
---
Do you have stront to make a jump?
---
You got a good point. there is a reason renters roquals fits multiple wcs and drone navs instead of tank, and It can save them in sone situation.
---
But you must understand renters are very bottom of eve in terms of PVP. Even sov null crabs have no experience in small scale pvp and their roqual pilot can barely light cyno and PANIC in panic.
---
You will may dissapointed but undocking caracals in time while understanding situation is very difficult for bottom tier pilots. Even they got some, It’s very easy to keep tackle.
---
In short, It’s true whlers are generally good players but I think you’re overestimating crab’s PVP ability because you’re decent pilot.
---
Can’t really get gud cuz reality is very far from ideal, for example, ratting supers must not die in theory if super pilot does everything right.
---
It's that in comic sans?

When he said "It's starting to make more sense" that wasn't an admituon of guilt, that was him piecing together the trail of what happened and he mentioned that this was still a misunderstanding.
---
I guess you're the guy who joins fleets and never reads motd
---
Why? That wasn't him saying "now it makes sense and I'm caught", it was more of a "I'm starting to see where the misunderstanding has come from".
---
Remove any circumstantial nails 😋
---
Contact a GM. They can move you, just don't abuse that kinda thing.
---
Uhhh, it is, technically
---
Raven or bhargest can both do it from range.
---
Did it died?
---
I meant the siege module not allocating proper bonus.
---
I did it in a vargur before bastion existed and it was absurdly fun and profitable.
---
Should have clarified, it was a corp-owned KeepStar, not my own as that would have been extraordinarily expensive.
---
Polarized rattle might be possible to optimize for fun. Lots of the dps is the drones tho. If you are super manual ratting tho the rattle can get high ticks anyway so try it and please tell us how it went. Got any video of your vindi technique?
---
Would you kindly provide information on how to do that? I would massively appriciate it.
---
Is it possible to link a regular account to steam?
---
No videos sadly, but I'll look into making one. I've never made a video before.
---
I was in the middle of refitting the hull, I transfered all of my stront to the station inventory for some reason I dont remember (why would I do that in the first place boggles my mind)
---
How do you link a steam account with Eve? I just login through the normal desktop client.
---
Thankfully, Im an Alpha right now, but the game still lets me fly the carrier (can't use any modules though). I will attempt to apply to local sov owner this weekend (no way in hell I'm playing EVE on my laptop). Thanks for the help on that.
---
He also owes NER 10b+ in unpaid sponsorship. After he rage quit because he leaked intel to a director then threw a fit when they followed it up, without his permission, because they didn't follow his timeline. Apparently the site was set up for Polaris to control. Such a shame they threw you over tho, sure you could have done a better job.

---
The service of providing pings wasn't a scam. That was legitimate. What clients did with it is up to them. You'd have to be pretty brain dead not to know how to put it to good use and I imagine most of our clients did just that. Jay wasn't scammed/got ridden because he figured anything out. He was dealt with because he was incompetent, leaked opsec things, and an absolute buffoon that simply made things up for clout. He was exposed and xdeathx got rid of him for it.  
---
Clients for Polaris varied. Alliance leadership individuals of different alliances who could afford it.  
---
I use technically because Polaris (as led by Lazuli) was a stand alone group. Technically it could operate without NCPL and at times did operate beyond NCPL's concerns.
---
If you’re character is in a null sec alliance you don’t really want to go to high sec with that character, especially in a mission running ship or blingy incursion ship because you’ll just be killed by high sec war dec corps. If you have an alt that’s different but otherwise you’re kind of stuck with ratting/salvaging in null if those are the only options you’re deciding between.
---
&gt;this is incredibly trivial stuff

Thank you! This is extremely useful!

 There is indication in those hard to read triglavian data streams that they plan an expedition to known space to find the drifters hives and learn more about pod pilots.This giant ship is likely the core of the expeditionary force
---
Petty downvoter. Fired from Polaris (and second choice in the first place). Remind me again how you killed gons.
---
Yeah this is true, there's only so much you can go in a certain direction before you can't get any better Skill points wise. And its usually not as long as you think.
---
And with the new skill injectors, it lowers the entry time considerably. But do know that in game skill and out of game skill progresses at different times lol
---
Holy shit! 50m ticks
---
Great vid once again, keep it up!
---
Someone in CCP didn't got hisjob right
---
What kind of carrier jumps with stront?
---
Do you have a cyno alt? If yes pm me, I'll tell ya how to get to lowsec
---
That sounds great. No having to worry about range like with blasters. What NPCs?
---
I goofed around with a polarized Vargur on sisi which is an alternative, but it didn't pull 50m isk ticks, at least not with my flying skills. 45 mil at best, probably closer to 40 usually while paying full attention, 35 while just grinding and talking on comms or whatever and only half paying attention. Bright side is it's SUPER easy to tank even while polarized.
---
That's not probably terribly helpful. I also used to rat on tq in a Vindi, before polarized guns were a thing and back when carriers just sat in a pos with their noses sticking out. It was a lot more fun than the Vargur. For me that was mostly because Vindi webs are just massively fun, and because killing stuff with max dps min tank is great.
---
If you put 3 66% abyssal webs on a vehement you can theoretically hit every subcap at almost any range (within webs) with capital guns, so maybe that, if you're massively wealthy and feeling insane. That's probably not helpful either though.
---
Yea if I'm going hard. Its actually pretty satisfying killing a bc in one volley
---
Yes, that is a thing, rats just don't aggro outside of a certain range. Now, those ravens aren't doing much DPS, not are they applying particularly well to anything smaller then a battleship, but it works. It's very similar to using a single super to clear a NPC sotiyo. If I'm not mistaken 1 raven makes less ISK/hr then a snake in a C3, but you can run them for a lot longer with less ISK risked. Although one might argue it is out side the spirit of WH ratting, whatever that may be, there are more problematic things involving WH ratting, such as C4 sites or farming drifters with an astrahus.
---
F12 in game.
---
Shush..
---
Get 4 rattlesnakes, 5 polarized purifiers, 1 salvager cd.
---
Daytrip to a C5 with many sites. Do the sites with 3 tinker rattles on one side. Spawn/tank the drifter boss with a passive rattle and dps it down with polarized bombers simultaneously at the other side. Salvage with destroyer (use command destroyer if you want another gtfo mjd). Ez 1.5b/hr.
---
Before the fh got frigates, you were able to get upto 50m ticks with a t2 talos. But thats some years ago.

They won't move capitals unless you get a GM without a clue... so yeah it will probably work.

that was 1 small optional part of the event.
---
which wasn't even as bad, in isolation, as the entire frostline event was.
---
i mean, unless it's a bhaalgorn and you're in null... i'm not sure who's going to actually want an amarr battleship in their fleet but have fun.
---
last i checked, nobody flew amarr battleships in incursions.
---
All citadels are corp owned. You can't own a structure in an npc Corp. Have you looked at the Killboard and checked asset safety? In null if its destroyed, your assets will be moved to the nearest low sec npc station. I believe its the same if its unanchored as well.

It is now CCP "official policy" that they don't move any ship that has it's own jump drive. I've had a few unfortunate experiences with this as well as some people I know.

c0ven was for most of the time a competent and pvp-oriented group, with tremendous spy network and many wars won against all odds. But as many almost single-nationality organizations in EVE, it had a tendency to attract and harbor completely useless members just because they were of the given nationality.
---
Those members would act against the interest of the group for their own profit, but were treated with leniency or completely unchallenged, despite constant moaning and complaining how unfairly treated they were by the group or how many more moons do they deserve to operate (POS moon mining was the thing back then). 
---
It all changed when a small group of such people gained factual control of the alliance and led to its collapse.

I used a Paladin in C5s but it took about 40 minutes to clear a site and it was insanely expensive (Close to 4b + Asklepians). Still though, better "ISK/Hr" than a Supercarrier, and you make the price of it back after a day or so if you really go turbo krabbing.
---
If you feel that you have a **right** to not be blown up in high-sec then no, EVE still has the same ruleset and philosophy as before.
---
oh snap no more DNG for you?
---
It’s not democracy it’s a show put up by ccp. They could just put up another better show.
---
Shoulda put an ENAM on your imicus instead of a nano.
---
lol, where the hell are the tracking modules on mids ? i use one tracking module even for rats...  Get some dromis to slow him down, retri is damn fast... then shoot him with tracking enabled, you might get a chance. i'm not a fitting expert myself but it's common logic..
---
More like 2 lowseccers in a dread and a Thanatos... Vs dessies

So isn't this worse than RAF?  RAF is 750k and this is 250k...

I guess the 7 days of Omega is worth 325k or so? I'm not sure.
---
Well if you ask this question then I guess not a single. Sorry, newer used capitals. My idea was that he need help - cyno and fuel for jump if he don't have it.
---
To be fair, I think the ehp Nerf on fighters is bad. Already have problems keeping them alive in sited

60 hours mining to get an Imicus? That’s close to self harm!!!

Do the tutorial for exploration and I’m sure you get one for free with probes!!!
---
What was in it's cargo at time of sale?  
---
Was the Molok just a shiny wrapper to disguise a volume transaction of "value changing" goods relative to the CSM info?    
---
    
---
Or, was the Molok purchased using ISK obtained through illegitimate means?    
---
Similar to your avg ISK buyer having his isotopes (or whatever the currency is these days) confiscated?
---
Grams are good for shooting other fighters, not so much ships. From the Gram description
---
&gt;Micro Missile Swarm: The Gram can launch a swarm of missiles that are especially apt at destroying fighter and drone craft. These however do very little damage to full-sized starships.
---
Totally read that in Butters' voice XD
---
That's dreasds. Carriers are for killing larger subcapsular mostly. Or for countering other carriers
---
Apply to Pandemic Horde! We're located in Geminate, just a dozen or so jumps from Jita!
---
It's a Krabby carrier, so dumdum probably only has templars
---
When you enter the hole, your ship is lost to the event horizon with no end in sight.  You still control what you've plunged into the darkest depth, but your clone woke up on the other side of the galaxy and it's not you.
---
Yeah lol no
---
Scrape the CDN?
---
Link KB
---
Is it a normal game mechanic to diminish the 1800dps against larger targets(like explosion speed, radius, etc) or is it a special restriction that diminishes the damage of them against ships?
---
Homage to Tikktokk
---
I mean it probably wouldn't be more than a service ban or a C&amp;D but depending on the implementation you could get into DMCA anti-circumvention territory.
---
You mean like how they temporarily and for a limited time made entering t4-5 abyss not create a suspect timer?
---
Can alphas jump if stuck in their ship?
---
I fail to see how a CDN would be useful.
---
So?
---
THAT SHIT WAS RED!
---
&gt; Thankfully, Im an Alpha right now
---
Then you won't have jump skills.
---
Air superiority fighters have a massive hidden damage reduction against regular ships
---
Would you mind sharing your fit? Sounds very nice, would love to see if it's doable in regions  with other rats as well ;)
---
Hi ulf &lt;3
---
Interesting. Thanks.
---
If you don't have any alts then you'll have to join a corp that holds sov there. Also you should get some alts.
---
If you have alts then use one t bring your carrier fuel, a cloak, a depot and a 500mn mwd and some istabs. You can then plot a route to lowsec and jump your way to lowsec. Stick to empty systems, use self destruct cynos, it'll be good practice if you ever have to move a super or titan. If you die, don't worry, carriers are fairly cheap anyway.
---
Too bad you do not have any ISK, i would like to have them.... If you did.
---
Try bringing webs, you might kill something if you bring the right tool for the job.
---
The problem with carriers was, they made shit pilots able to use a single ship to dominate everything without having to think about fitting or support. Just cyno and blap.
---
You're just angry CCP returned you to the bottom of the pile, where you belong

wait this dude's vampire huuunuras? the annoying fucker who would get all butthurt when people called him out for his stupidity and then say he was being discriminated against as a tranny?

The skin is for the attendees of the russian fanfest and the system C-J6MT played a big part in the history of the russian eve community.
---
That's one more shitpost
---
You must not have, another poster thought the same. C-J was apparently a somewhat important location in Russia-related EVE history some time back.
---
I don't think so.
---
I’d be hugely tempted to recreate Battlestar Galactica until I got blown up. But nah, fly safe o7
---
Probably multiple thousands of isk from imicus basic insurance so i'd say he's in for some serious cash

Invitation only, no B-rated teams, only the best in eve (but we don't know that because we're only inviting people we know personally or are eve-famous).
---
Yeah, it's a pass from me bro.
---
Fuuuuuuuuuck off
---
If you want to have fun try fitting a solo frigate for t1 abyssals. It's a good deal of fun to pilot!
---
I don't know but I think its the latter, just based on the description given.
---
If you want to know why C-J is important to the Russians... read empires of eve vol.1 by Andrew groen. He lays it out fantastically.
---
That bass line for Yes' Roundabout is amazing. Good marshal kill also, but not as good as that bass line.

---
I was going to suggest the vindy when I looked at the title, then I read the actual post... Glad to see I'm not the only madman to use it! I don't think anything can actually beat the polarized vindy against serpentis or guristas, but polarized torpedo boats sound fun and probably don't have the range issues of blasters. Out of curiosity, do you also use void ammo exclusively, or do you swap with something else?
---
Is that 2 volleys or just 1 shot each from 2 ametats? Iirc you could 1 volley sabres and frigates prior to the change with two tracking mids.
---
Whats your fit? Because most likely your Vindicator costs more than T1/T2 fitted carrier, especially after insurance and has 1/100 carriers staying power ( EHP/cyno (not worth jumping because youll be dead before help arrives/ability to fight back).
---
So they didn't get kicked after that? Lmfao no fucking balls
---
Link your vindi fit pls.
---
Technically, no. You can learn how to do things, you can make money, you can make social connections, you can train skills. Or I guess you could just buy them with IRL money, but don't do that.
---
Practically speaking, unless you're willing to grind near-constantly for ISK, it is going to take you months of training in order to fly anything that isn't a very basic and poor-to-middlingly fit ship. Even if you do start grinding like that, barring you being extremely exceptionally skilled or lucky, you're looking at making maybe 100m/h, maybe up to 500m/h if you're good. It could vary, but again, exceptional skill or luck. This means that if you intend to do something like accelerate your training, PLEX your account, or just be able to have a sizable cushion of cash on hand so you can kill your own ships and not have it be a problem, you're going to be investing a pretty considerable amount of time doing it, and frankly most of the ways to do that aren't very enjoyable.

I will highly recommand to ESA to collapse this hole ASAP ! who know what can come through

Is this about some players or what?

LOL wut? The entire event was built around trading in those boxes, and the rewards were complete shit. The only other reward was the point grind and the skins were meh.

I think its the latter as well. Also, from my experience, the DPS figure you see when simulated includes the special attack.

A rattlesnake smashes C3s. 40-45m a site, if you're bad you'll do about 4 sites an hour. Rapid heavies, light passive tank (0.8-1k), application, MJD.

The faction data/relic sites are the same as NS.

The sleeper data/relic come in two difficulties. Easy (current class) and hard (current class +1). If you are in a C3, there could be sleeper data/relics that do the same dps as normal C4 anomalies (class +1). There could also be sleeper data/relics that are the same difficulty as the normal C3 (current class) anomalies.

Use this.

Nope, I tried to keep DnG active over the last year or so but I was never able to get our rate of recruitment to be anywhere near our rate of burnout. Some people are really good at this kind of thing - I'm just not one of them.  Eventually it got to the point where we struggled to pull 5 in fleet for a roam during USTZ, at which point I more or less decided to throw in the towel and let someone else give it a try. DnG is currently lead by it's founder Tristan Dacuhna, who is working to rebuild its membership in the traditional amarrmil FW setting. After being the senior space autist for about 2 years, I was more than happy to hand it over to him.

You will love it. Old players like to say they are important, but anyone can fly a ship and listen to a fc klicking f1. If eve is about a community, then it wont matter old or new. Rrends will be frends. You cant fly the biggest ships, but you proably dont want to anyway straight away. Dont listen to other, get in and form your own opinion. Goodluck, have fun, and dont fly too safe
---
That's entirely possible. There are other features as well that make it look like a ship rather than a citadel (like the under construction thrusters, etc), so it could go either way yet, lets see.
---
If you're new and want to be involved in stuff like that join a nullsec group. (I recommend pandemic horde for obvious reasons). Just apply to join the corp, or search for my character name (Nemesis Inkura) and click apply to join the corp I'm in. The "join horde" in game channel has people that can help you as well.
---
&gt; He has no case.
---
I think that's why there are courts to decide that. Would still be interested to see.
---
No
---
You can be a valuable ceptor pilot to any gang in 2 months skill points wise. The problem is the amount of information you will have to absorb and put into practice so you wont die instantly in 5secs. With that said avoid EvE if you are into pvp only. The game is completely garbage. Better put your time and effort to another mmo.
---
Can you have my stuff?
---
This is a fantastic idea. Thanks for doing this!
---
Pandemic Family.
---
Originally Pandemic Legion (Daddy) with Waffles (Big brother) and Pandemic Horde (Little Brother). Usually includes at least uncle NC. nowadays and sometimes affiliated groups in general.
---
Panfam is one of the three big blocs with the others being Imperium (Basically Goonswarm Federation + allies) and Legacy (TEST and allies).
---
And as Alcoholic Satan has said, Pandemic Horde is a good place to go if you want to blow up stuff.
---
God I hate this subreddit.
---
superiority fighters dont have a 'special attack'
---
they are equipped with the scram and damage to kill fighters and drones. so no. your not meant to use these to shoot at anything but excessively low tanked ships.
---
First off, there are fits for prophecys that can do 200 mil/h in c3 on youtube.  You have VNI c3 video that is made couple months ago. Dont rely on others to spend their time for you and answer all the questions you have. Go on test server, take the fit, insta teleport to c3 and start farming - see what works and what doesnt. Get the feel how the things are done. Better to die like a noob on test server than on real.
---
Seems to be VIP only discount.. Didn't show me anything(yes i was logged in)

Can I have your stuff? I promise to welp everything.

You have 3 neuts, 2 Geckos and 70k EHP... The 2 Geckos will rip everything a new one once the enemy is dry.

Aren't you the cringey retard who got done for messaging underage girls?

Good price on the Meteor Pack, cheaper than a month sub Plus 110 Plex.

---
How dare you pass on the elite PVP circle jerking?
---
Yes, I understand that anti drone fighters dont have a special attack. But, the OP mentioned Einherji's, which do have them and this post is about damage application. The fact that the simulation shows a higher DPS for light and heavy fighters than is applicable is relevant to the conversation.
---
Just keep the alpha, you never know when it might come in handy!
---
Tapi flare so probably cus of rorq changes
---
3 months until judging? That's so far away

you really want webs on them at all times i usually keep at 7.5k and if pulling out further 10k+ i heat the webs.

Thanks man its appreciated

Obviously just relaying chat is trivial, but what isn't is organizing it and parsing it to make it useful beyond lumping it all in a chatroom.
---
Poor me with a 36h shift :(
---
makes sense, the burnout factor can be real. I am too flakey with IRL stuff to ever be a CEO so I have mad respect for those who can, even if they are in rival groups, like Doomchinchilla with Collapsed Out or memelords like Chance Ravinne with Wingspan.
---
PanFam is the name for a group of alliances. some of those big groups in this game have newbie friendly organizations that will teach you a lot and get you into those kind of fights if you are interested.
---
true, i only wanted to further on your comment.
---
as the comment of his you decided to write that was specificly about shown DPS of superiority fighters.
---
and you did not point our it was normal light fighters you were talking about regarding dps shown.
---
superiority fighters dps shown is actual gun damage. but they only work effective vs fighters and drones.
---
look at it like a hidden armour value system.
---
grams attack have low armour pen, and deal less damage to a normal hull on a ship or rat.
---
but lightly armoured drones and fighter hull they apply fully to
---
Here is a low skill C3 snake fit T2 what ever your can for more dps and tank use Gecko during the whole site and missiles on cruisers and up.

im not entirely sure what the age of the game has to do about where it is now, and where it need to head to.

just didnt feel like im progressing anymore &lt;/3
---
Why? The fax remote reps save every dps the other fleet tries to kill, so they switch to the fax in hopes to kill it.      
---
But fax local rep is also too stronk. 
---
That is the scenario.
---
Oof
---
Just one question, could you point me in the direction of a guide to actually use them
---
&gt;4 man drafts are horrible. Sure, you still end up with the right number of drafted cards, but you've only seen half as many, so you just end up with a load of chaff.
---
As opposed to 8 man draft where there's all kinds of good cards at 14th pick?
---
2v2 money draft is a fine format.  I did it for  years.
---
"Space superiority" fighters have a hidden 80 or 90% damage reduction if you are using them to shoot things that are not drones or fighters.
---
That's not Latin! Legionaries! Arrest this Carthaginian! :p

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Roll on tomorrow ey! But for me it's the Falcon Heavy launch I'm looking forward to. Not because it's Friday. Every day is a work day for me.

Well I mean this is why I'm glad I'm not a test liner pilot lol...
---
500 dps!? Jesus christ, whats the clear time on that? I'm guessing the DRB is completely out of the question too?
---
Maybe you could ask CCP for a special event where you need to donate x amount of minerals/PI/etc to a CCP RP character for gate construction, and then an event itself where it can be anchored/blown up. 😂
---
Gives me time to sculpt a rifter...just enough time cos I'm slow and lazy
---
Vargur does not  care about npc type, all are the same
---
1 goon down, 60k more to go
---
Except that there are mechanics that create something that can be taken advantage of. 
---
Jump fatigue, supercap application and fax reps create a situation where ships that should be strategic asset are instead being used to swat roaming gangs with out the need for support from subcap fleets.
---
Jump fatigue creates an environment where, unless someone has a dread bomb ready to go, you can use caps without the risk of being counter dropped
---
Super cap application means that high tank, high dps ships that were designed to be strategic assets can destroy small gangs with very little support.
---
The high base ehp of super caps and the duration of panic mean that these ships have a very long time to call for back up. Combined with fax reps and you get small groups of like 3 ships that are literally never going to die to a small (like 5-15 man gangs).
---
These are all mechanics that can be changed to affect super cap umbrellas. 
---
Pre-phoebe anyone that used caps carelessly could count on being dropped on by someone from across the map, changing max jump ranges or the way fatigue stacks up can create areas where hostile umbrellas overlap creating risk if people do anything in those areas.
---
Reducing application and nerfing retarded shit like bosons can create situations where supers need things like rapiers/lokis so that they can actually hit thing. Lokis and rapiers are ships that can actually be realistically killed or bumped or booshed or something by small groups.
---
Faxes are stupidly strong, if you tackle a carrier or whatever and have like 5 dudes with you in nano shit then having a single fax dropped on you basically means you get to wander off or bash your head against a wall until the hammer gets dropped on you. I don't actually know what can be done to make faxes strategically meaningful while also not deleting small gang fleets, but nevertheless it is a mechanic that can be taken advantage of in order to create an umbrella
---
TL;dr while a super cap umbrella is the result of player organization, that organization exists in order to take advantage of some specific mechanics that can all be changed to make umbrellas less obnoxious.
---
Salt
---
Do you mean use them... in a graphics editor? In the game?
---
So what you're saying is that alpha bots could do it?

For some reason I feel there's a tengu cloaked nearby

The information in the article referenced by OP (as the rest of  [http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Main\_Page](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Main_Page)  was created using CCP's DB dump of the official Eve wiki that CCP took down (they gave us the DB dump as an opportunity for the community to preserve the content if we wished to - and we did).  As with the original official wiki, there \*are\* player-created pages.  That wasn't one of them.  You can tell which is which on the wiki by whether or not the page is locked.  CCP Official pages were locked when the eve-inspiracy wiki was created in order to preserve that content - even if it comes to be outdated as Eve changes and evolves.  Source: I'm Havohej, one of the admins (and the one who took the DB dump and imported it into a fresh mediawiki install).

If you really, absolutely must have PF regarding capsuleer ship shaving crews, with an official CCP stamp on it, read the chronicle Hands of a Killer on the CCP fiction portal.
---
Or maybe its just a big nemesis
---
no i do not, i really wanted to have that ability but found out you have to buy into the feature, so instead, i use first person mode without any UI on screen, it creates a similar effect but i am tempted to buy 3D mouse for the full range of abilities.
---
i joined eve in late 2018 and boy getting tackled in my rorqual a total of one times was by far the most exhilarating moment of my life, I cried and cried on comms until i got saved by a billion titans and supers! that was so cool you guys I love this game haha I am the best miner
---
we all come back sooner or later, make sure you skill que is full. 
---
o7 from a fellow Brand Newbros line member.
---
Eve is a fun but the grind and wait for skills to unlock can be crushing if you're just getting started and only have one account and you're a tiny cog in a huge coalition. And if you say you've been playing a year that's for me JUST a year, not OMG A WHOLE year. 
---
Make some alts instead and go do something else like pop in a wormhole or join bombers bar, you'll unlock and discover much more of the Eve experience that way.
---
i felt the same, but i realised that i judged the amount of fun and "progression" i had in the game was directly linked to the Isk i was making.
---
doing a tonne more pvp now and only krab to feed those habits and it has been a breath of new air.
---
He'll be back
---
if you create a system, where old tickers are reused, you do it not only once, but keep it up with rules.
---
yes, corp tickers being reserved by 1-player corps from some trial accounts eons ago is indeed a problem, they should address.
---
you can simply introduce a system which lets you switch your corp being away, increasing the safe period to whatever, 10 years. it could as well keep historical corporations up. there are many things to consider, yes, but they can  be solved.
---
at some point such a cleanup has to happen, and it would be best to nail down the rules for the future. since by now i think we are past the idea of eve going to simply fizzling out of existence.
---
the whole corp creation process could need an overhaul, checking ticker availability, maybe add a few more decal icons, the interface could generally need some modernization, and the tickers should be addressed as well. 
---
also to the white knights here, don't act, as if this is some kind of special preservance by ccp, all that i see here from a software perspective is an old system which had not been overhauled yet out of time constraints, and still works like the initial technical solution, which did not foresee the consequences, or hoped to resolve them later on.
---
comments are even better: 
---
&gt; Besides, I do not know what you are even talking about. I am still  ratting with my carrier and I have no issues at all in PVE nor PVP with  them now. Fit 2 Heavy Neuts and show that Retribution what a DPS monster  is like. Or justt light your cyno and get a Fax and a titan in to fend  the attackers off. 
---
Dunno if troll or if he is for real...
---
Not for sale - except there are $ on last picture?
---
Either way they look good.
---
are these kits?
---
It doesn't - I was far from the best spy the GIA (and later, PL) had, I mean I had the bot that mechanically relayed pings.  The value-add info I added re the organisations I spied on came from the person to person approach.  Knowing fleet A is going to be at location X is great, but it doesn't win fights.  Fleet A probably has a spy in your fleet too.  What kills corporations and Alliances is getting between real people, planting distrust, destroying that same persons ships over and over again to break them.
---
Think the last pic is a mockup official model store
---
Courts have already decided, that's the point.
---
If by interesting you mean a case that actually makes a judge collapse in laughter as he's dismissing it, then yes, it will be super interesting.
---
Huh.. Thats really long ago :O i think most eve players from today dont know these times neither would have they been around then :P
---
Feels more like water but closer air is closer than to space lol
---
How to donate ISK?
---
They are for sale, do you hear me? They *are* for sale.
---
I’ll take a Naga and an Orca for starters.
---
Seriously, we’ve been asking for these for years. You’ve got actual completed models, that you show us, and then you’re not going to sell them?!?
---
yeah but does he has Liquid ozone?
---
While I understand what you’re saying and I agree with some of it, players with superior organization should never get nerfed. That’s literally saying that because you succeeded we’re taking it away so those who didn’t succeed can be better. 
---
Also, 5-15 man gangs of subcaps should have an extremely hard time, if not, impossible time to kill 2-3 capitals. They are capital ships after all. If a cruiser or two could kill a carrier alone (I know under certain circumstances like shit fits, bad skills, poor decisions, they already can) what would be the point in caps at that point?
---
The way CCP handles these nerfs is wrong. Rorqs are powerful, as they should be, but not over powerful. Nerfing their mining yield I agree with, but also nerfing their tank by nearly 50% AND their ability to save their excavators all at the same time is extremely over doing it. That’s like nerfing cloaking to only last for 10s at a time or saying booshers can now only boosh one other ship with them. It’s the same type of nerf. All these things send out the same cry from different groups of people. 
---
Yes, Rorqs are strong mining ships, but now, the risk vs reward is not worth. It was already 250+ hours of mining for return on investment before (far higher, by at least a factor of 10, than any other mining or ratting ship) now it’s 300+ and you have a much much much higher risk of loss. 
---
It’s fair to say that rorqs have been nerfed into the ground and are fast becoming useless, even inside a super cap umbrella.
---
CCP would be half-way up his ass in minutes if he was selling them
---
Turn off the ingame sound and it's a good one. Though the first font reminded me off "Ark" and the music is piss. but thats just my opinion. Vivaldi Version? xD

How do you deal with jamming?

No. Not a chance in hell am I taking it easy.

Don’t show me that stuff and then say I can’t have it.

Find a C13, get a confessor and do the C2/C3 anomalies ;)
---
Nice  video making skills, Sir !
---
Seeing as how CCP hasn’t been able to produce and market these, when they have the most amazing space ships in any game on the planet today, how much fucking effort would it take to have this guy produce these models in volume [or bespoke, since it’s printed anyway], and then sell them?
---
How fucking hard is it to provide a product that there’s a market for if someone could figure out a way to sell them anywhere on the planet? Seriously.
---
Someone link the cinematic video of imperium supercaps moving to 6RC?
---
I miss the old c0ven living out of stain, all of the old entities that lived in stain were some of the most dangerous dudes back when i started.
---
I actually put a support ticket in and they never answered the question directly and only linked the RAF page for the answer 🤷‍♂️
---
Thanks for the pointers! Definitely going to check them out.
---
&gt; Courts have already decided, that's the point.
---
Good to know you linked references ... oh wait.
---
I fear you are misinformed about when it went on sale
---
Pretty good but I would try to rely less on clips of ships on tether/move ops.
---
I am not sure, but i think you shouldn't use eve-reddit for selling anything in EVE ... better use the eve forum for that, there is a sales area for that.
---
Or use eve internal channels, or even sites that are specific for that.
---
\#freeB/S/P
---
There's a way that doesn't interfere with EULA at all - launch a client (preferably web or android emulator) and put it through proxy with injected CA (Discord client doesn't do SSL certificate pinning), then log/parse the websocket/http communication. I use something like that to keep track of edited/deleted messages for whatever servers I'm in, just because.
---
The way it feels to me over the last 10 months of playing is their stance is "No, you aren't supposed to do that. We don't have a way to prevent you from doing it though so best advice is don't ask don't tell."  
---
Honestly, there is now a second revamp to the RAF program. If it still lets you do it I should think they would have put a simple check in to see if you were doing it and shut it down if they actually wanted people to not do it.
---
Like you can use the same email and have identical usernames except for 1 character and it was still registering in the RAF page. To me any amount of prevention would mean no. They are aware it lets you recruit yourself and have been for a long time. I feel like they only don't officially say go for it to stem the tide of people registering skill goo alts to sell at the character bazaar.
---
We're reaching levels of spodbrain that shouldn't even be possible.
---
If you had asked like a normal human being, saying something like "could you provide a source where [on multiple occasions] a US court has ruled that governing law clauses in EULAs and NDAs are respected in US court" then maybe I would have done it for you.
---
But nope, you parade your stupidity around on the internet like a fashion show, realize you're wrong, and then expect someone else to help you learn.
---
Go find it yourself, you won't have to look far. If you educate yourself on this occasion, maybe it will prevent further ignorance.
---
Am I the only one who finds “I’m quitting Eve” posts kind of ridiculous?
---
This is bullshit. Fuck snitches.
---
it's not sad dude, there are dozens of cool other games .  and you still could play eve offline on reddit
---
Fucking beautiful. Outstanding work
---
There is already the annual Pod And Planets contest for that, in case you are interested. Makoto is more of a visual guy :-)
---
Do we downvote if we're gaypwned too?
---
EVE Online tabletop rulebook when?
---
Battlefleet New Eden
---
he'll be back
---
That's one hell of a crash in both amount produced, mined and isk increase. The anomalies nerf doing good work.
---
&gt; CCP would be half-way up his ass 
---
the only thing ccp were mastering for years
---
No, it does seem strange and dramatic.
---
Yes those were ravens, but the c5 was without any effect
---
I'm sorry about this, but we really can't mass produce and sell them without CCP authorization. 
---
As far as I know, EVE's peripheral product license has already been sold to other companies, so there is nothing we can do about it. After all, we don't want to cause trouble. 
---
But we have been looking for channels to communicate with the authorities. 
---
Maybe in the near future, every EVEr can buy their favorite peripheral products.
---
Do you have the name of the pilot that have his molok confiscated?
---
i hope you sell them regardless of ccp , because fuck them

Actually sort of sad this image didn't get taken a few years earlier so he would have seen it.

nerfs dont apply to this mer yet
---
Branch has 6 tril ISK from ratting and Delve 9 trill yet the population difference between the 2 regions is huge. Much Botting going on in Branch or just many people staying up all day every day. Very suspicious.
---
Literally the most recent update is a blessing
---
1B
---
The north  have always been stronger in ratting than mining
---
Thank you for your answer.
---
Thank you for the repply sir.

Thank you for the answer.

Have fun with it and feel free to bling it out if you can afford the extra costs.
---
I used to do this too, sucked when someone found you, but,  meh,  already replaced.
---
Nag still isn't
---
Their damage are divised per five when you don't target fighter, Iirc they still do full damage on drone (hello excavator).
---
Hey it's fixed now, welcome back anytime \^-\^
---
Off and on for a year. I’ve been playing since 2004. Talk about grind. Still going though.
---
Was never caught and often tried to use it as bait.
---
Just wanted to be sure you're aware that literally just training into battleships isn't enough, you also need to train the relevant drones and/or guns and/or missiles for it (sticking small beam lazors on an Abaddon is...not a plan). It's worth getting EveMon on your PC - https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon/releases/tag/4.0.11 - and putting in the skills you need to a plan (you can filter by Alpha trainable) and it'll auto pull the pre-reqs. You can then do an attribute optimiser to see if you can 'respec' your attributes to cut down training time.
---
Just that way you can make sure you're not forgetting about a bunch of secondary skills, and that you're getting the most SP/hr possible.
---
I.... Would play This
---
Beautiful, finally some 3D models that aren't a spray painted mess of layer lines! You can really see that a lot of attention went into finishing, and/or a much more suitable printer was used.
---
The paintjobs are spot on too.
---
Is it possible to sell the files to make these without getting into any trouble? There are plenty of places online to have things 3D Printed.
---
Lmao,no bot in eso
---
It has to do with how our server decides to send events relating to a player ship to the client. The receiving function on the client accepts all these events and decides if it wants to show the player a message. I messed with this function, and tried to make it decide to send the player a message if the source of the event was a drone in the players ownership. It would take too long to explain why exactly that broke, but suffice to say it was not safe to do while a session change is in progress. We exchanged this logic with something else that actually worked for all (hopefully) cases :)
---
DELET C4
---
Yes, that is indeed sad for you.
---
Please note I don't know much about pre-2016 C0ven, so my perspective will be based on last year of the alliance existence.
---
As an alliance I don't feel "bad" would be proper word to use. C0ven was single language, single nationality (and, by that, basically single timezone) alliance with shared identity being based on out-of-game relations (speaking polish), so as a result it created this mix of people from hardcore bloc-level pvp players, to smallgang/solo pvpers, to pve-focused players and full on krabs. It lacked clear direction and various playstyles often clashed, leading to quite a lot of tension and drama around what was or should be expected from members - it's hard to find good expected level of involvement if you have some people treating pvp as necessary evil and some considering anyone not keeping their main 24/7 in staging ready to login and join the fleet as waste of space/resources. And given the alliance had less than 100 active players, it wasn't hard for everyone to know everyone else, so "hiding in the crowd" wasn't really an option.
---
As a result of that, some people changed, some left, it was relatively stable until TEST/CO2 invaded south in early 2017. After the campaign and alliance being pushed out to Stain, decision was made to dissolve alliance and every corporation going their own way - most joining or eventually ending in Goonswarm. Again, people who didn't enjoy goon life left corps and moved out, some more people that left C0ven before that rejoined their old (or new) corps back, generally it's mostly same people playing together, just now in larger and more flexible environment. As of now, I'd say a bit over half of 2016 C0ven members are in GSF, with others either not playing anymore, or being spread across other alliances that fit their playstyle better.
---
TL;DR: C0ven could seem bad depending on your viewpoint - either by harboring worthless krabs or encouraging oppressive elitists to harass players who didn't live EVE, but in the end it was nothing more than having big playstyle variance in relatively small group.
---
Only the ones that don’t give their stuff away with the promise of doubling it if they send them 1m ISK first.
---
hi, im bad at graphs, can somebody tell me, if the new carrier nerf etc did something to bounties etc?
---
Been playing for one year? 
---
Most people have been playing for 10+ and quit at least once a year and don’t make posts.
---
Works for me, soooo dunno why you're having problems
---
I did some tests against fleetfit (MWD + plate) Retribution and - from no DDAs, no application mods, single dronenav Hel - there's virtually no difference between SSFs and light fighters. The issue is you now **need** Dromis to do anything because SSFs won't be able to keep up with MWDing frigate (SSFs are painfully slow), and lights will apply terribly without webbing fighters. Time to 100-0 Retribution was around 30-35s assuming it went on long orbit around the super and used ADC as soon as it got into armor.
---
Multiboxing is not botting.
---
This is the worst bait ever or you are plain retarded, please biomass, delete your reddit account and burn your modem.
---
All nerfs in April release don't apply to this MER
---
Just... when fit and piloted properly, SSFs have no chance of catching up to anything capable of going over 6km/s unless you have Huginn/Rapier support.
---
Pope can abdicate.
---
Huh, got tired of pressing f1 so you hit caps lock, i approve
---
What's the smallest non-renter PVP alliance out there that one could join as a relatively new player (let's say 10m SP)?
---
But the anomaly nerf should show.
---
I didn't sleep well, so I'm too tired to smug properly today. Sorry to all the querns fans out there. We pressed the F1 key pretty well this month.
---
Its not too late but it's been infected with Korean mmo random loot box mentality and pay to win mechanics
---
I'd like a Nyx.

Oh wait....

You’re a huge retard.

Eso is the second most densely populated region in null.  FRT is 2/3 our size yet the combined NPC bounties for Detorid and Insmother are 7 tril, which far eclipses our 4.5.

ccp is so damn bad in merchandising it's freaking sad.

Iam wondering what their "monetization director" which they were searching for last year is actually doing.

so easy money on the table, hard to believe how bad they are

Eddie Bravo debunked this already.

What if the "flow" of the triglavians is actually a metaphor for a gate to Stain ... ?
---
I want
---
That does not fully explain the huge numbers compared to the population. Nor does that explain the growth in ratting bounties compared to the previous month.  
---
Some systems in Branch with high NPC kills currently are held by Ranger Regiment. Maybe someone from that group can shed some light on the increased numbers

Simply put, you will die and all your assets will be lost.

Don't know if he is innocent or not, but if he is, then CCP defamed him. He can file in his state or abroad. NDA is a legal document attached to a real person. CCP/Pearl Abyss stated the person violated his NDA. If he is innocent, then that is defamation. 
---
Pearl Abyss themselves have filed a lawsuit against [gamers on defamation](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/9tdt7l/korean_gamer_being_sued_by_pearl_abyssblack/).

I don't see why in this case the other side couldn't do the same.

Modify the X-Wing Miniatures game and make custom tiles/cards for them?

Also.... now I want this even more.

Fuck cracked
---
Reach out to CCP, the worst you get is a no, the best you get is having talking in regards to a deal being made for you to be able to sell these, be via licensing rights, or being their 'official' maker.
---
It has slightly less dps. Stack penalties of gyrostabs arn't calculated properly. Base dps is OK, with 2 gyrostabs it has 1xx less dps than before.
---
&gt;Iam wondering what their "monetization director" which they were searching for last year is actually doing.
---
I have an official statement from an unnamed insect on the issue:
---
&gt;I'm afraid that isn't possible right now as \[the monetization director\] is on an intergalactic cruise."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"When he's going to be back?"

&gt;"Back sir? He's in his office."

&gt;"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise ... in his office?"

You don't need to scram them when their brains are already scrambled :)

TBH, the text is so dark, I could barely see it when I was actively looking for it.

You'd still be selling someones IP without licesning rights or permission, sketchy at best.

No such thing as quitting,  just taking an alpha break.

This is my Tengu set up, it is fit to do relic hunting, with the refit to do  mostly all combat sites (carrying the appropriate hardener variant) also as a bonus in the bottom left the fit to run Gurista mazes at the time, you don't need crystals so get the scannyboi implants u will 2 hit most things and glass implant makes doing relic sites like you are in bird box, and of course the dick move cargo scanner so you can cherry pick, its an older pic but that's what i use

Agreed. Narcissistic
---
When a group of developers dont understand that their coded intentions are not the desired intention of the user its built for.
---
EVE is a case study for why 90s style development should die.
---
I am European and I can't stop laughing. :D
---
No just join a corp that does that
---
Safely mine.... After I link multiple rorqual deaths under a super cap umbrella.   
---
I think OP wants to mine in peace in NS (probably drone lands) without any risk / without a defence fleet...
---
I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.
---
he has been used before - by squishy
---
Just keep updating that skill tree.
---
Lol
---
Not really no, you'd have to join a corp that uses nanogangs. 
---
Some Spectre Fleets might use kinda nanogangs but they are few and far between.
---
You say that until someone like zarvox or another highish profile person says it.
---
Idgaf who anyone is in eve. I don’t even know who those people are.
---
Hmm sad but ok. Thx for the very fast response.

Idk why you’re saying blaster nagas are stupid people use them for qual hunting all the time here’s a recent example

2004/2005 Checking in, currently on my 3rd break. I'm starting to feel the itch.

Yeah, that's called a public allegation. Why do you assume that everything they assert is true? Could they not have been misled by others with in-game or personal motives? Could they have their own motives to boot this guy who was elected? I'd hate to see you on any jury.
---
Yeah, so I live in Delve and the carrier changes have had absolutely zero affect on me, other than my super ticks are very slightly less than they were before.

That wasn't a complaint. Just acknowledging the connection between work and the start of the weekend.

**Greetings capsuleers!**
---
Our recent balance patch doesn't seem to be achieving the desired results, so we are going to be further reducing the effectiveness of your rorquals, carriers and drone boats. 
---
The war against botters has been extremely successful, with a total of *hey steve, how many should we say we've banned? 200? 400? Oh, over 2500? What do you mean you guess? Alright, I guess if anything goes* **over 3000 accounts terminated for botting**. The war continues, please continue to send those reports our way!
---
And finally we would like to introduce a new line of skins coming your way, for all carriers and rorquals, the special **Decommissioned^TM** skins come complete with animated warning stripes and much more, check them out in an upcoming dev blog. Oh and don't worry, we have this skin coming for a wide variety of choice subcaps too in the near future, so keep that plex handy!
---
At some point I should really learn how to read these.
---
People come and go, thats the way it is. Hope U will be back someday Mr @NodaNodaa .

Checkmate, skill injector advocates.
---
Make them pay for invultimers like 1 bil per cycle otherwise you dont have a siege cycle. This makes not everyone put up his own astra to krab in peace.
---
I'm intrigued.   Not that you are quitting,but as to why you were compelled to post said quitting here.
---
Ok that are some good news. I have to Check if the Times are fitting for me. Thank you for the Information
---
I never said that I have 10m SP, or that I want to mine in Rorquals. How many SP I have is irrelevant to the discussion. You should look up what an "ad hominem" is.
---
I suggested system calibration points. Each system can only sustain an X amount of citadels based on upgrades. LS and NPC nullsec should have only x amount of calibration points. If system is fully used you need to kill a citadel in order to anchor another.
---
Imagine being the largest coalition in the game but you whine when people come to your space with all of two caps. Where were your supers, too busy dropping on risk-free targets? Just because you were scared to drop in your "i win" buttons doesn't mean there's any way you can spin this :)
---
ya i feel bad for calling out this guy quitting 5 months ago it almost read like a b4r at second glance.
---
I don't know where you're from, but in the US this is not so clear cut. Such agreements EULAs and Terms can be negated by unfair practices. Are you familiar with "fair use"? He is certainly able to show material damages. I'm not an attorney, but you may be aware that McDonalds was successfully sued for $22M when a customer spilled her own coffee in her lap. 
---
Regardless of the legal question, that's for the lawyers to figure out, my main point is that this action violates my personal standards of conduct for CCP. This is also where their real problem lies. Players don't want to feel as though they can have this level of investment wiped out on a whim with no details or method of appeal.
---
CCP = Colon Caressing Proctologists
---
Oh so you were just posting like a drooling retard, ok. Now fuck off back to your krabbing and shower your guests with your tears :)
---
it's because the siege module is now considered a damage mod and so stacking penalties kick in with the first damage mod
---
yea, but twitter even more so than others
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
My general copy-pasta for new players is below. 
---
Make sure to be buddy-invited by someone if you decide to start playing. It is a very significant bonus you get for doing so.
---
The [#newbie-help channel on the Discord server](https://discord.gg/Pjac38Y) is also filled with people who want to help out. 
---
&gt; General way to approach EVE as a new player, but yours may differ completely: Ingame tutorial -&gt; career agents (all if they interest you, see the Eve Uni link below) -&gt; thealphasguide -&gt; SoE Arc -&gt; maybe some exploration for ISK (see pinned message on exploration guides) -&gt; ??? -&gt; try PvP (maybe with Spectre Fleet) -&gt; look into joining a corp/alliance (see pinned message about newbie corps) -&gt; ??? (see the picture on what to do below) -&gt; enjoy!

Social media has given everyone a voice.  Unfortunately everyone thinks their voice is saying something important enough that others need to hear.

I still think there should be only X strucures allowed per region/system

Usually 1 hour before downtime and 2 hours after. Check the videos they post on here, usually EVE JP Small Gang or something.

Apply to join an alliance, then do all the missions.

Not unlike your post from the look of all those delicious downvotes, back to the forums you go
---
How do you get triglavian mails?
---
I suggested something similar, but limiting it by AU diameter of the system... So 1 for every *N* AU and require them to be so many AU apart, not the 1000km bullshit. 
---
Prob too late for CCP to fix
---
The downvotes were to be expected. Yet the post somehow gathered enough views to generate 70+ comments.

Might be a problem with Athanors in some cases.
---
Thank you, but I prefer not to change my Windows settings in order to play one specific game.
---
Yes, probably because everything you say seems to be meaningless bullshit. Again, official forums would be far more suited to your particular needs.
---
Make it fuel based. After x calibration additional structures cause fuel consumption to increase exponentially in the system (and include cap fuel too).
---
That way if you want a hundred Astras in a system thats fine, it'll just cost a trillion ISK a month.
---
Why i cant see any PoS while rooaming through systems?
---
Do i need to scan them down or there is an easier way to see what is iin the system?
---
Yes. This is a great idea.
---
Information shards are extracted from tiny Triglavian balls.
---
You have to PVE and get the Lore Items.

---
This is not recommended, as new players should spend at least a few weeks in high security learning about the game and what they want from it. Simply joining a big group can be a good thing for some players, but for others it will be the opposite.
---
Nothing compared to modern games, maybe a few hundered MB? :)
---
&gt; BRAVE declared war on them
---
&gt;They still exist
---
i don't see which part of this is surprising
---
Legend has it that if youre in the C4 when The Purge comes, that you die irl too.
---
Mayhap its just a spooky tale told by space truckers over a beer late at space night.
---
The problem with all of the suggestions listed below that would prevent this is that any inherent limits on the number of structures too strongly favors the incumbent.
---
If there are limits new corps in HiSec would never find a place to plant their first structure. In Low and Null the resident could choke out the number of available slots to prevent an anchored invasion.
---
Not saying I have a better solution however, everything I can think of can be evaded via holding corps.
---
christ i want that so bad
---
Another example of unchecked player activity running out of control.
---
if only CCP would allow a "creator store" , kinda like an ETSY for CCP fan made merch
---
He didn do nuffin

---
Until you would have to fight kikimora gang, I doubt it will matter much to you. NSA nerf is inconvenience, sure, but what really matters is application nerf.
---
&gt; He can file in his state or abroad.
---
No, he cannot. For reasons stated more times than I have the interest in repeating.
---
&gt;NDA is a legal document attached to a real person.
---
He was the fucking moron who shared his real-life identity. CCP didn't make any announcement regarding this situation using his real-life identity.
---
&gt;Pearl Abyss themselves have filed a lawsuit against gamers on defamation.
---
Pearl Abyss sued the guy in Korea, this entire argument revolves around whether or not a US judge would immediately dismiss any case by Brisc against CCP in the US (he would.)
---
&gt;I don't see why in this case the other side couldn't do the same.
---
I can't say that I'm too concerned with what you think should happen. Laws aren't interpreted by the "I think it should be done this way" mentality. No judge is going to give a fuck what you or anyone else thinks when applying the law.
---
For the record, as repugnant and disgusting as I think Brisc is, and as laughable as I believe he "denial" is, I personally don't believe US courts should respect governing law clauses in things like EULAs and NDAs. But my personal opinion on the matter means nothing, and it certainly doesn't change reality.
---
Could have something to do with anom nerfs causing saturation to be reach at lower populations. As you know. Intended
---
One more thing you might want to consider- nullsec has local chat- wormholes do not.
---
You might want to factor in the cost of replacing ships often- compare that with knowing exactly who and how many people are in system with you in null.
---
No, your account has to be created via steam

As far as I know, you must be in possession of a Semiosis Conduction Console item in-game (mine is of the Veles Clade variety, but I have received a mail from Perun as well). I received mine from a cache in the tier 5 capital construction site. I do not know if they drop outside of that rare site.

---
This (and related links there) should cover most of your questions on PI.

Yeah you're right that would too strongly favor the incumbent contrary to the 8 keepstars that they can anchor in the same system.
---
I was gonna say the same thing tbqh...
---
Found out about Eve “crafting” system and was excited and jumped right in. Omega account with 3 characters training the first 30 days. 
---
Wanted to start with a passive ISK then after playing for a little decide my career path. All 3 characters are almost finished with the skills required for PI so time to figure out a direction. I am currently thinking construction but totally lost on where to begin.
---
What direction is good if I wanted to build off of PI? What items does PI resources transfer in to for Manufacture?
---
Thank you ahead of time!
---
Send me one for free and I'll donate to your model production charity

Damn.... I would love to see an Eidolon and a Gnosis as models. Eidolon is the Jove Navy battleship, not seen in years, and the Gnosis is a Jove Battecruiser and my fav ship.
---
\&gt;  100 titans
---
That killmail shows 1 titan. The other one shows 2 FAXes and 0 supercaps. It's only a matter of time until Goons learn that you need to cyno in slightly more than 2 dudes in supers/FAXes now. But they have And that refitting away that survey scanner or those drone nav computers for some more tank might actually be a good idea. There are still a LOT of possible improvements possible for the defending side there - it's not like Goons only has 2 FAXes/1 titan in their umbrella.
---
But more importantly, I'm not arguing against the changes that made Rorquals more fragile. I like those changes too. Those changes probably *did* affect Goons more than small alliances - at least in our alliance, 90% of the time a Rorqual gets tackled it dies. This might now be 95%. Whereas in Goons it might have increased from (if I had to guess) like 10% to 20%. So the cost of getting a rorqual tackled in our alliance went from 90% of 2b to about 95% of 4b now, an increase of 2b, whereas in Goons it increased from 10% of 2b to 20% of 4b, which is only a 0.6b difference.
---
That's still better then an invader being able to anchor 0 because all the slots are filled.
---
If you limit it by corp, well all your doing is forcing a proliferation of holding corp alts and not actually reducing the number of Cits realistically. Now if corps had a very limited blue list they could do and cits were hostile to non-blue.. it might be doable.
---
There is absolutely an easy way to find this.  
---
1-accounts logging in thru the same launcher instance
---
2-accounts logging in from the same IP
---
3-accounts subbed to the same CC# (probably the easiest way imo)
---
All of those three are completely automated and you’d never need a human being to even find that.  
---
So I asked the question.  Got a “don’t ask don’t tell” answer logged on their support system.  
---
Literally asked directly “can I do this?”   
---
Crickets.  
---
To me if it was truly something against the T&amp;C the answer is a pretty straightforward “no”.  It’s definitely seen as a vehicle for a paying customer to expand their game experience and to create more content in game.  
---
It’s still confusing to me and if they decide to hammer down on the program the way people use it for alts I’ll happily oblige.  And in all seriousness I’m never going to field two dozen rorqual alts/skill farms.  I just wanted another hulk/PI account.
---
 no    fking    way
---
Cool cinematic, I like it.
---
You'll find that this is the industry standard way for video game publishers to deal with rule breakers. There's no due process
---
Steam related: so I saw the free give away they're doing for the started packs. My question is, do I need to be playing through the steam to get that? And does anyone know if I'm able to get one for each of my accounts?
---
&gt; If there are limits new corps in HiSec would never find a place to plant their first structure. In Low and Null the resident could choke out the number of available slots to prevent an anchored invasion.
---
You must be new.

What's up with Tribute's trade balance?
---
Yeah that's basically what I was talking about but again that is essentially circumventing their ban on user bots.  Just because it isn't through their API doesn't mean it's not a user bot.
---
They were beaten back to one system and gate camping the null sec entry from Amarr for their content.  Seems like a decent accomplishment especially since the blues around there can use the ansiplex gates to get around their camps
---
I’m gay
---
Very old actually, but admittedly I've won Eve for about 5 years now, although I do still keep tabs on things so I've not truly "won".
---
It worked before. If only citadel reinforcement timers weren't so shit there would not be a problem. CCP created this mess.
---
Well, the best advice is to do some basic googling and maybe check the available resources.
---
All I want is a Triglavian Strategic Cruiser
---
Looks like a stationary defence platform of some sort, yeah, based on that massive gun.

Ah HED- such a pita getting in stuff from empire. Not as bad as N-RAEL used to be but close.

Is this when you put down a structure in every anom spawn point and just crab with structure guns
---
Lol @ Vale and Tribute "full krab mode"
---
I'm liking the idea for just solo exploration or some group for that to join just to get an understanding of the game and whatnot

Yes because anoms have been nerfed twice now over the course of a couple months.

I appreciate the fit you posted, thank you very much.

Semantics, I see it more as fixing inept default Discord client by adding local chat history backup, word alerts that work outside direct pings and general fully functional chat client basic utility. Since it doesn't interfere with Discord service outside regular normal HTTP/HTTPS proxy, I highly doubt that'd count as "user account automation".
---
&gt; Anyone who creates a new account 
---
So is it just new accounts or any account that was created through Steam?

Because CCP Alpha keeps saying it's for any Steam-made account:

That's a lot of words for saying "I automate messages sent to a user"
---
CCP can you be less shit at selling merch? I have more fan made shit than official swag.
---
Spy
---
What do you mean?
---
i believe you're breaking goon law by discussing rorqual multiboxing without a permit, please, calm down miner.
---
Or "I log all incoming and outgoing communication to avoid being dependent on service provider for that". Which is much closer to the usecase.
---
And yes, I do log everything I can unless it's either technically or legally difficult (EVE EULA has explicit forbid for logging and decrypting game client communication, therefore not touching it).
---
That Robert Mueller comment... LMAO!
---
Oh, [You,](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubforWhitePeopleOnly/comments/b9a230/we_cant_say_the_nword_because_black_people_own/ek3ecuj/) [Have,](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubforWhitePeopleOnly/comments/bbulwm/if_i_had_to_give_one_compliment_you_guys_do_have/ekmocrk/) [No,](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubforWhitePeopleOnly/comments/bazkk0/sub_for_most_attractive_race_only/ekglvva/) [Idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubforWhitePeopleOnly/comments/b9ml88/i_love_being_white/ek5x727/).
---
Positivity...but on the other hand...
---
I approached CCP a few years ago, asking to:
---
\- Make and sell ship models which I hand craft from cardboard (examples in my post history)
---
\- Make and sell model kits (of my own kit design) of Eve ships
---
\- Charity auction the models that I have made, supported by CCP and to a charity of their choice.
---
I never recieved a reply from the several people, including Falcon, info@, legal@, enquiries@ etc email addresses for CCP. I quit the game pretty much because of this total lack of contact.
---
But why i can see my corp citadels in overview no matter my position in system, but those neutral and others i cant?
---
&gt;  new corps in HiSec 
---
So, you're saying... they'd either quit or move the fuck out of irrelevant space? Sounds good to me.
---
Can we have a broken NDA skin line?
---
I would very much like to see this. Even if it were still pictures with voice acting. A feel of the old Eve.
---
Bro it's bots
---
Details on briscgate
---
Drop in production and mining means normal imports are driving it I'd think
---
Awesome work!!! What do you use to make these? It looks like you used a really high quality printer with good model files. What kind of paint?
---
Literally no one feels sorry for rorq pilots. Other, of course, than rorq pilots.
---
Why does CCP have such a poor history of leaving gameplay elements in a bad condition, potentially for many years, even thought it's known they're damaging to the wider ecosystem? 
---
Is it down to lack of resources, or is it down to conscious choices by management to leave them as they are?
---
too soon
---
if you are aiming for nano, i would recommend trying by yourself since you could easily bail from scary situation and quickly learn if you failed to bail and get blaped.  you could easily start with frigates (nano tristan , slicer , worm) and continue with cruisers
---
Oh god yes
---
Are you saying 2 timers (and that's if they're too lazy to fuel) that can take a week each before you can destroy even a 600m structure that can be spammed to the point where even large alliances can't make all the timers, dragging the dull "content" out for months just to take one system and you don't even get what's inside at the end outside of wormholes ISN'T FUN??!
---
Using a rattle or other BS I assume?
---
Can I have his stuff?
---
just wondering, what was it before? it was other structures, isn't that the only difference?
---
Ever been to SV5?
---
I know the meme is that EvE played right is a Darwin simulator but there really is a place for the style where corps "grow up" naturally and organically into larger organizations. I mean, that game needs players and if everyone quits because they are forced out into null and their sandcastles are instantly kicked over that gets the game no-where. 
---
The problem with chasing them out of the nest is that I can't think of a good way that can't be gamed or abused by null entities. At least as long as it isn't a bannable offense to have more than x alt accounts.
---
With Asset Safety, I dont know why we can't have the same timer mechanics as POSes used to have. No, instead we have this nonsense.
---
sock sock -&gt; shoe shoe   
---
or   
---
sock -&gt; shoe -&gt; sock -&gt; shoe
---
Where does he see the game in 5 years? like what new mechanics would he like to see implemented.
---
If only CCP rewarded the basher of these structures with something other than 2-3 cancer timers and asset safety.
---
Yeah dude, insane right?
---
What? More like Forts and Sotiyos.
---
I get that putting up citadels is much easier than dealing with the old starbases.
---
What I don't get is *why*. Is this just some hilarious form of trolling anyone that doesn't make a filter for their overviews or something?
---
Or is there a gameplay reason? Can you simply not take sovereignity untill every structure has been blown up?
---
Imagine giving a shit either way.
---
Real answer: Most people probably want to know about the details of Brisc Rubal's recent permabanning. You can google Brisc Rubal EVE and get the deets yourself but tldr is that a real life lawyer and lobbyist was permabanned from the game because he, as a member of a player-elected focus group, allegedly broke NDA during one of the Group/Developer summits and two high-ranking members of his space guild profited (in-game) from it. This gives his real life career some serious consequences, and it's juicy soap opera drama for the rest of us.
---
Never sock-&gt; shoe dude...ever
---
Cheers! Figured it'd be a fun locus point for all the creative types to work around. :D
---
I mean, we've totally given prizes to shit-post quality stuff in past contests... ;)
---
Here's a question: why the flying fuckety fuck are you in a rental alliance when you can join a bloc with a super brella and not pay any rent in return for pressing F1 a few times a month?
---
It's a ways away, yep! The idea is that we're going to be learning more about the Invasions at the meets to come, so this gives people time to come up with new crazy ideas as the events unfold. :D  
---
That, and a shorter time frame seemed forced, so...
---
Please do. :D
---
Way to steal my question
---
Heya! Evemail me as Makoto Priano for us to work out the particulars.
---
R O T E       K A P E L L E
---
People can figure out why they've been thrown in a kangaroo court without admitting to being guilty ya walnut.
---
I’m going to say that this is disheartening for sure. You reached out in good faith and never got a response.
---
I don’t know what form this took but this is something I would have taken to Fanfest. There you get to talk one-on-one with the movers and the shakers. Maybe that would have netted you a better result.
---
I’ve had deep conversations with developers at Fanfest and they were genuinely interested in our input. A few of the things I advocated for [and others, of course] have been taken up and are now part of the environment.
---
I’m sorry your proposition didn’t make it. I support all great ideas and yours definitely seems to be right up there.
---
Look into the main parts to build the main components for ships/capitols and fuel blocks. 
---
Producing PI in high sec if you do not own the Custom Offices will be difficult as well as how rich the planets are with resources. Best planets for PI are in 0.0/null sec, low sec being average then high sec mediocre at best. 
---
Now if you’re in a Corp where they own the offices and you’re in high sec fill free to give it a try, but if you are not try looking for low tax offices to try it out. 
---
PI seems fairly easy to set up but it takes a lot of time and capitol to maximize.
---
So basically check who lives (primarily) in the null regions shown.  You can see how much “work” they’re doing.  
---
Smart alliances can obfuscate their production by splitting residency and production between regions.  They can also track coinhabitants of regions by taking the totals shown here and backing out their estimates from that region.  
---
So for example Delve is all Goons.  They are clearly mining and ratting a lot!  They must be also building a lot. Yup. See that too. 
---
They must have a lot of ship/stations.  They will be a formidable opponent in a war.
---
Yeah the Siege of C-J6MT was where what was left of Red Alliance held out for days against an overwhelming force and forced them to retreat.
---
It's #13 on this list.
---
https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/eve-online/280213/eve-online-best-battles
---
Corps can grow up while actually providing content to the rest of the game by roaming nullsec to fight standing fleets/spodbrain krabs who don't read intel or by moving into a wormhole. People in HS corps may as well not be playing the game considering what they actually do.
---
Do they ever intend to make it actually appealing to play the game as a new player? Because whether or not it's actually true, the game currently feels like you can't do anything meaningful as a new player.
---
So eve is for years missing one of the gate connections, this subject was discussed thousands of times.                 
---
Can you ask Him when a "Lowsec gate to Stain will be introduced?"     
---
Thank you!
---
How is his bonus from pear abyss?
---
nah this post was to inform my corpmates and alliance mates that i will be quitting not for you shitters booo! shoo!
---
I tried the slicer an instantly fell in love. Only downside is the horrible cap problems.
---
But did you know that Poitot is the only system in Eve named Poitot?
---
free risk brubal
---
Really excited for both the eve lore coming and for some sweet propaganda!
---
Thanks. It's something I'll have to spend some time on I guess. But right now, I'm a little guy with 2 accounts hiding in an out of the way hisec system. Probably not gonna have a huge impact on me for a while.
---
What cool new (doomed to fail) products will my EVE subscription money be underwriting this year?
---
Have you actually read the article tho?
---
Man there are a lot of child-raping assholes on this sub. 
---
Have fun out there, there's really no quitting Eve, just long extended vacations lol.
---
Who the fuck puts a shoe on a socked foot before putting the second sock on??
---
Any details on upcoming ship releases? 
---
Also details on where they want to take missioning PVE would be cool.
---
Some people run missions while waiting for fleets or corpmates. Some more PVE love would be nice.
---
If you want people to know how to get under battleship guns put battleship npcs in level 3 missions to teach people.
---
Yeah I mostly read it cus it was kindof a pointless article anyways imo... I just don’t really understand the point
---
How do you post something as awesome as this and say it's not for sale?
---
these are fucking incredible
---
2 volleys each fighter, so yes it’s worse than it was, but imo (as a mainly subcap small gang pilot) that’s tolerable. You see super warp in, it’s gonna take a minute to land and start engaging you and in that time you can hopefully kill anything webbing/at risk of webbing/scramming and disengage. Fit properly, using dromi+ siren, they can deal with subcaps. The guy complaining on forums he could track a retri with no tracking computers, dromis, or any support and using light fighters could kill him at all, and I think that’s a better spot balance wise
---
Before he got banned I was watching the OpenComms show (or should I say, "The Brisc and Evil-Jay Leno Experience).
---
While watching this show I got a terrible feeling when Brisc went out of his way (During the whole  "If PLEX stays at 3.5m per, I will be happy) and said something along the lines of (warning: very paraphrased): "Fuck CCP, Fuck the CSM... I am all about the players".
---
Now it is very paraphrased. I am not at my computer but the vibes still ring strong from watching that show. That episode was very cancerous and a lot of loose tongues where live on the air. From Matterall being bashed at, overly drunk "fuck you" statements and I am sitting listening to this shit, thinking I was in for an interesting discussion while smoking a joint and having a coffee out my back.
---
After I felt like something bad was going to happen to Brisc. I had that feeling man. If you haven't seen the episode, go and watch it and sit back and listen. Now ask yourself if you were an actual CCP employee and here is a CSM member (In a manner if speaking), letting your company down and not supporting the company. What would you do?
---
Personally I would not ban him in game for bad mouthing. When it comes to inside knowledge and in game profit...that is when he should be banned. Nobody really knows anything and CCP have yet to say anything really.
---
This makes me question... was Brisc removed because someone didn't like what he was saying on that show (Before he got banned)?
---
Huh? I put my shoes on first and then my socks.. what’s wrong with you people?
---
Yeah you will most likely never be a blip on this thing.  Which all this does is shines a huge fucking spotlight on where to go for “content” since it’s obvious who’s got shit to blow up.
---
Oh come on boys, don't you mean you want an eve first person shooter?  
---
How about a mobile game!
---
Hey, no it's not too late, i started 2 years ago and a friend just started and he has a lot of fun, you can be useful in many things even as a newbro
---
Don't forget to join a Corp ASAP
---
I'm happy not being a blip. Blips are really good for aiming torpedos at.
---
In fact, we have contacted CCP Shanghai and even CCP Iceland for many times, but due to the special geographical problems, we have not got any authorization so far. 
---
But interestingly, some factors are changing now, and maybe we will make new progress
---
agree, honestly i switched to worm just because of it , but as a bonus it could take on some cruisers
---
Is there any plans to put up some of daddy PAs dollar to hire a competent dev team able to release non fucked balance patches more often than once per decade? Can some of the horrible game mechanics we've dealt with since citadels made it to the drawing board get fixed to be less fucking aids?
---
Huh? Give me an example of a meaningful thing that you can’t do as a new player? Because I as a new player don’t have any problems doing anything that anybody else is doing, maybe fly certain ships yeah but that’s no biggie.. I’m curious tho
---
Exactly my friend!
---
Only those dockable are viewable in the overview.
---
I see you're still not sure of quitting Eve. 
---
Do it properly and with finality.  Fatality. 
---
You need to burn your bridges to properly quit Eve.
---
Break the dam, release the river.
---
I'm curious about a T1 BS hull that I can use for NS sites. I know you can replace the VNI with a Domi, but what about an Armageddon?
---
The real question is, why does CCP hate Cache so much?
---
first trig gate : to stain
---
Aura, Butter-voiced mod... would be epic maybe
---
This is really going to be a serious legal problem for us.
---
I wouldn't trust myself with a career mission either to be fair.
---
You can only have 1 steam account I believe, so you can't claim the prize multiple times as it would make no sense if you could. You can still play your steam account via the regular launcher since it connect through the EVE launcher.
---
I'm sorry but that'd interfere with their plan to become the sort of company that can merge with studio wildcard.
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
Making this model really puts a very severe test on the accuracy of the printer. In addition to selecting the most precise printing process, we also did a lot of manual polishing work
---
why did CCP not go public with stock but went for a buy out by Pearl abyss
---
1) You can't redeem it on a non-steam account.
---
2) Invest your omega time on training skills.
---
Most entertaining part of Polaris was when rival groups paid for each others intel. The system was aware of both fleets being formed when each entity thought they had the element of surprise on the other.
---
It was regular stations. Conquerable stations. Also to build one would have cost 20+ bils.
---

Hey guys, you don't know me but I've been using the Twitter mobile app for about a year now. I think this is the last day I will be using the app. Thank you for the fond memories, thank you for the life lessons, but most importantly thank you for the memes.
---
*modle store
---
their what
---
Make actual profit without amounts of effort that are out of sync with what you get from the output, or having to do things that're so mind-numbingly boring or don't require input that they don't qualify as playing a game.
---
Fly ships that can actually do something interesting beyond sitting at max range doing Logi or suicide tackle.
---
Not get absolutely rolled by people who have more skills than you.
---
It was all done using either free services or code written by myself. No paid software or services for any of the analysis.
---
why does it take so long to do anything, and why is it so hard to do things that 90% of the community wants?
---
Dreads insure better than excavators
---
Do they plan to release new space areas based on the new triglavian collective without a timer to explore?
---
your what
---
That was the petty cash :p.
---
Because CCP was already owned by another party, which sold it to PA.
---
When will POS be completely replaced (i.e. small citadels/FOBs)?
---
What about that "Hold my beer"-tweet?
---
What does a balanced game look like for him?
---
(also SoE destroyer, when?)
---
Yeah, you still had some isk liquid if I remember correctly, and some K-space holdings
---
You all have cell phones right?
---
i see :( . i just got butthurt because how many times they [failed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5jacvi/shipping_cost_in_eve_store_is_ridiculous_high/) with [simple merch](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7xb94c/triforce_nyx_scam/) .
---
well it's an amazing job anyway.
---
Wild to see the gulf between goons and the rest of the galaxy shrink to the smallest it’s been in a long time.
---
This post is what burns the final few bridges.
---
Not just real models, but 3D data models are part of the intellectual property of the design, so we also can't sell these.
---
The active ISK delta is still going up... and that ratting income is off the charts.  My think thoughts are that the anom changes worked its the botting that needs to be addressed.
---
Ah that's a shame...
---
Also skills, duh, but which? Far as I heard PI doesn't work after you run out, you keep the colonies but you can't actually use them, also I was thinking of sitting in an indy ship and not docking but they thought of that and barges don't have turret slots...
---
Trig POS incoming....
---
Kinda looks like a point defense satellite
---
What does he think about the idea of a test server where CCP can test their releases before deploying to live
---
X-up corp. 
---
Xup public in game
---
wow a neutral freighter surrounded by blues that aren’t shooting it must be a red
---
shhh, his narrative
---
Uhh, wat? Kill mail is from derelik
---
That one rorq looks less impressive when you see the 2 dunked supers
---
As a high sp player what are the easiest ways to make “profits” then? Apart from the high risk, high reward ones? If you want just easy isk buy plex and sell it, simple.
---
Questions like this will just get a corporate speak answer about how they're listening to feedback, continuing to improve all areas of the game and that things take time because they really want to get it right.
---
You gotta go for something really specific, like why is there still no dedicated balance team? Or who is actually the lead game designer right now, does anybody know? Or what do you personally think needs to be improved right now in regards to balance/the economy/resource distribution?
---
So you want all your shit handed to you and be on equal ground with those who have worked for, often, over a decade in game. 
---
Got it. 
---
Shouldn’t you be out hanging Bernie signs and arranging AOC rallies?
---
....snowflake.
---
reeee how dare people have wrong fun
---
Defend the krabland
---
&gt;albion
---
bait
---
Another month, another Goon Economic Report. Yay...
---
Imagine thinking hello kitty space is fun
---
my what?
---
I second this one.
---
Please, spy more, this is nothing. It might actually SHOCK you, what other hiden gems you can find in my history. Always go DEEPER! :D
---
Ask if they’ve ever heard the definition for the word “incrementalism”.  Then see if they just swing the reaction pendulum to the extreme every time they nerf something.
---
It’s all in the metric to English standard conversion. I think it’s caused by a rounding error. On top of that Bob said “No” and then as it was spoken it was all “No”. The all “no”ing Bob has spoken and before you ask... “NO”
---
imagine posting to a public subreddit to tell some sperglords that an irrelevant sperglord is quitting
---
Send a rep to fanfest please. Then take my money.
---
What answer do you honestly think you'll get from this? Like he's going to go "Aw, you caught us, we've just been dicking around. I guess we'll get back to work"
---
invest in skills that are related to what you do in-game.
---
How do you find the free give away?
---
LOL the game in 5 years...ask him where he sees the game in 8 months with player numbers continuing to drop, huge portions of the playerbase unhappy, gameplay and botting worse than they have ever been 8 months seems like a more realistic timeline.
---
Why ships from before 2009?
---
F
---
The lack of gate makes stain the stain on new eden that it is
---
imagine thinking fun is objective
---
That's the point. A fax should be able to save most of the other ships or all of them and himself. That doesn't make it too strong it just means you didn't bring the right shit to kill it. With faxes you have to bring neuts/void bombs. Sometimes you jus gotta admit when you cant take a fight.
---
I only do industry on my steam account and I've already been mining in a BS before quitting last year, only got on because I thought the starter pack would change something but apparently it was just a few skins for my collection.
---
Would you mind sharing your fit via ingame Mail?
---
Sorry but switching corp is off the table. Thank you
---
They have nothing to do with sovereignty. Sovereignty does affect them, but only in the edge case where you're anchoring a structure in a sov system that doesn't belong to you. In which case, you add 24 hours anchoring time for every unit of Strategic Index the system has.
---
The reason it's done is because humans inherently enjoy turf and owning things.
---
all lies, i live in null for years and know full well rats will agro on you from anywhere on grid, 1000's of kilometers away and even ECM and damp you
---
imagine thinking fun is fun
---
And CCP wonders why the game is so stagnant. Major conflicts in modern EVE are a boring full time job.
---
Left wing destroyed
---
Stupid libtarts hehe
---
I mean you can make just as much scanning as a newbro as you can with a rorqual?
---
Depends what’s interesting to you? If you focus on a role you enjoy you can generally get there pretty quickly cruiser down, pirate ships open up a lot of options and the trig line is incredibly powerful. However as the size of fleets increase the less useful/interesting things generally are on the individual level.
---
Maybe provide some more info on things you’d like to do or how much isk you’d like to be able to make and people can help more.
---
Unless you're a cult of personality, it's probably best to just tell your friends you're quitting. Also anyone who's been playing for a year on a normal schedule is pretty much still a newbie
---
agreed
---
Just camp the system in a cloaked ship so they can’t not
---
Cant u just burn everything now with boosh ravens that have no counter?  At least that's what HK tell me...
---
Didn’t want get political, but it’s still the best current example of modern day tards touting socialism. Haha!
---
This is so true. If feels so boring for me. Nothing really happens. This is why i also have Ansiblex Gates. Huge alliances can keep their control over vast spaces with those gates without fatigue. Nothing will change in EVE for a long time.
---
Yea gonna go on a limb and say these guys ratting/mining aren't exactly broke and they've been mildly inconvienced.
---
Fair enough.
---
"Polaris was the network that handled over 200,000 messages a day at its peak from most major entities within EVE".
---
Who were the beneficiaries of this intel?
---
Or
---
Who should heed your advise most to mitigate Polaris' scraping of data?
---
Oh yeah I agree with you tho, socialism is definitely a bad thing. Look at europe with their healthcare and school and shit, it’s practically burning! They’re gonna end up just as venezuela I bet
---
Even the implication that there might be &lt;i&gt;SOMEONE&lt;/i&gt; out there who might go sock -&gt; shoe -&gt; sock -&gt; shoe is enough to make me lose faith in human decency.
---
But since OP is alpha now, can they even activate the jump-drive?
---
When in doubt, assume it's a skam. NPC corps do not send out invites.
---
That these guys brought bombers to while everyone else did the heavy lifting. I'm super impressed!
---
When does he intend to step down and let someone else take the reins.
---
i hope so, it seems like 2-3 people are actually working on eve and the rest are trying to develop world of darkness 2
---
Why does every little corp need its own structures?
---
Can I have your stuff
---
Thx for the question, I had not seen this and I just start playing
---
Are they planning anything to make mining more exciting? Against the bots? Do they have interns?
---
The Naga is often overlooked by many people imo, just because you find this pointless others might take intrest to this. Eve is a 'wide' game and its to easy to overlook some ships when coming up with fits.
---
Groups paid plex to get access to specific groups pings. The advice there will stop most if not all current automated intel systems running.
---
Only irrelevant since you can just mine 100% of what you need in null...
---
Socialized aspects in certain programs is different from socialism as a general practice, mate. You’re attempting a hasty generalization fallacy.
---
&gt;corps can grow up by playing the part of the game they hate (null)  
---
Sure thing buuuddy.
---
The highest accuracy of the printing process that can be found, the amount of hand sanding, the details of the use of PE to represent, and the use of Gaia brand model paint
---
Always worth scratching this one.
---
botting isn't a problem: local is
---
Imagine thinking
---
God help us if he gives the wrong answer, that would explain EVERYTHING
---
More reasons than that, really
---
If you hate PVP in any form this really isn't the right game. Maybe hello kitty online.
---
Am a rorq pilot dont feel sorry cause that BS tank saved me too many gooddamn times to be considered reasonable
---
What would you ever do if you got what you wanted
---
sorta just picked a random number xD
---
was thinking great war and earlier.
---
That's not the krabland
---
He tried to Briscly make some Rubals
---
I'm using normal t2 neutron blaster fit in serp area, can get 50-55m per tick though
---
Wonder what your fit is
---
I meant we run npsi fleets. Xup public is in game channel if u want to join in.
---
I've actually done that before
---
These structures can be spammed to everloving shit to make your system complete cancer to even go in, let alone invade. Poses were limited by moons and conquerable stations were expensive and 1 per system.
---
Why does every little human need its own house?
---
Who puts a sock and a shoe over a sock and a shoe?
---
Are you thick?
---
Assuming the goal was anything other than getting kills, at 100m/hr that rorq takes what, 75 hours to replace? At 150 it's about 55. That's pretty inconvenient
---
I kinda wish rapid lights were a bit less rapid and had a normal reload time.
---
&gt;  AT meta this year.
---
about that
---
This is already a thing...
---
Oh im sorry XD. I will gladly Text you in Your Channel
---
Everyone bought their goon supers and have jumped them back to their real home.
---
Plans to remove large amounts of ism from the game?
---
&gt; It´s not like they could fuck up the AT meta this year.
---
Yeah, not likely.
---
Several people reported that once “bought” you didn’t actually get anything.
---
he's still in denial about that so don't break it to him to hard, okay?
---
If you made an account via Steam it will be applied to that. Only one per Steam account, I don't know where to find the pack otherwise. It does not have to be a brand new account, it worked fine for me.
---
That's really interesting.  What got me into Eve was some pcgamer article from c.2008 of betrayal.  Thought it the  coolest thing ever in a video game so your post really plays into my roleplay fantasies of eve. 
---
So I must ask again, which entity(ies) of sov null will be hurt the most from this post.
---
Or are you saying your organization was pure 3rd party and merely delivered a service for plex to these large null blocs?
---
Wormholerbtw
---

imagine being so much of a moron you see spankpaddle in the mirror

i'd be willing to accept that.   less rof.  but shorter reload.

that's about all most of us achieve

This is REALLY good, doesn't mean a hard cap for system but still puts a soft limit. Would they go by alliance total cap then to prevent holding corp workarounds?

Drones are pretty good use of PI resources.

That was the thought I had in the back of my mind. I was hoping for conformation. Thank You.
---
You seem to have missed the point here. Nerfing rorqs does nothing to solve the problem, the issue lies with anom respawn rates. Instead, we get nerfs that hurt players that aren't under the protection of a mega alliance. 
---
So when you go out looking for rorqual pilots and other content, make sure to not think about that fact. They obviously couldn't be related in any way.
---
At that point dont they become....light missile launchers?

He'd literally explode in excitement and relief. I bet it'd take out several city blocks.

Tengu still works really well for PVE just use Hwavies instead of Hams

It started as a service for NC. and by proxy PL but grew into a third party service selling Intel to whoever wanted it. 
---
This post doesn't truly hurt anyone unless groups take the IT information to heart. If they implement any of those measures then they should be able to screw with any active Intel systems.
---
I know the Russian block had a similar Intel system. Only reason I know that is because we managed to infiltrate it and relayed all of their intel as well as our own!

It apears in T5 abysal sites. So either get a ship thatcan run those. Or buy the filliments to go there in the cheapest unfit t1 cruiser you can get. But its random, so who knows how long that will take

I'd do bad things for a model of a Rifter/Thrasher/Stabber/Hurricane/Maelstrom/Nid/Hel/Rag

I considered Fanfest. I've played since 2005 and never been to fanfest. Part of the reason for that is that I am physically disabled, so I don't think it's easily achievable. That and I am poor - if "makes models out of cardboard" didn't tip you off already :P 
---
I am currently looking at saving up for a laser engraver so that the patterns for the model kits can be cut more precisely (and with less labor) than I can do by hand.
---
It's a lofty goal for me but if it works out, the ease with which I could produce high quality and consistent kit parts would mean I could create a youtube guide series on how to construct each one. Then I could maybe just post them to people for postage cost, with a "donate to the Red Cross if you had fun making this model" note or something. That would be ideal for me. I've got kits for the Orthrus and Hurricane designed already, and I have WIP on the Navy Comet, Oracle and Rupture in different stages of completion; mothballed since I quit last year.

Thanks for the encouragement, I appreciate it.

On a bit more serious note, it kinda looks like a scanning / explo vessel. Big antennas or probes or sensor or communication thingies sticking out of it. Reminds me a bit of the Probe. Or it could be a small station or citadel  of some sort.

On the corporations search tool select english and over 1000 members. You will be given about 6 new bro friendly corporations to choose from PamFam is called Pandemic Hoard and we fight Brave, Goons, and Test. All are good choice for new players that want to play in fights like this.

Me too

That's how they used to be, I guess. Don't really remember.

Lmao

If you guys give us more reasons to undock titans we will. Lately all you do is gate camp i00 picking on the young and weak.
---
As someone who regularly kills rorqs of big groups under super umbrellas, you have no idea what you're talking about. Furthermore, I don't think you give a shit about "the little guy" and whether these changes impact him.
---
Ecm changes. Jammed target can still lock jammer.

20 missile is very low. if you need to reload you are fucked up. Yesterday i was not able to break a nereus tank with my rlm so...In a Nosprey with 3 BCU t2. I have perfect skill missile + cr calda 5.
---
they canceled them because people learned how to deal with orthrus
---
they're entirely irrelevant now
---
I really wish they'd have tied structures to celestial objects based on size.  XL to the Star, L to the planets M to the moons.
---
You should fix your over bite and smell also

CSM was created because of all that BoB crap. Obviously it doesn't work.
---
Low level abyss is waay better at teaching getting under guns/manual piloting than missions could ever be, I reckon. Plus there's the (admittedly pretty low) chance of crazy loot, I got a precursor destroyer skillbook from a t1 I ran in a mostly meta fit sub-30m Caracal that sold for over 200mil not too long ago..

It's like 20 bucks for one beer over there. You sure you want to go?

Love this change for PvE

Thanks! Looks like Abyssal deadspace might be a really good PvE choice

I was there. You can see me shooting my lasers.

Look up infinite vs finite games. This EVE is infinite.
---
It is free to play. Install, give it a bash, come with specific questions and once you have a fair idea what you like / dislike it will be easier to give clear and specific answers.

&gt; What do you do?

Whatever hell we please (within the game mechanics)

Define fun

&gt; Also, how do I play it?

Install the game and Excel.  Start learning.  Prepare for a prolonged learning curve with few short cuts.

Social media has turned all younger generations into highly emotional and self absorbed narcissists.
---
&gt;Wanted to start with a passive ISK
---
One other option to look into is BPO research.   
---
Buy a BPO from an NPC station, research it until the Time/Material Efficiency is better, then sell the BPO via contracts in Jita.  It's passive ISK generation, but you will need to do some market-research on what a researched-BPO is worth.  You'll need to find a citadel with the right rigs for research, and you'll need a solid chunk of ISK investment to buy the BPO and do the actual research.

Structures that have been unpowered for a week should have no shields and no timer, and everything inside it when it blows should have a chance to drop as loot.

We can now play the old TIE Fighter arcade game in Eve? Neat!

Where do you find the time to make all of these posts. I thought that you would have more focus on the work.

Have any of the changes in last year been made to make eve more sellable to potential customers?

Thanks and good luck.

My setup is fraps with a shortcut key to start/stop recording, then I mix/edit the clips with Movie Studio Platinum 13 (I think it's called something else these days), it's been working well for me on my somewhat agey computer
---
What campaign?
---
Why does this affect you you can't play EVE for at least 2 years. But those are the sacrifices we all make to better ourselves.  Promise me if you put your shoulder to the wheel you work will become light. I promise brother.
---
Don’t worry, I was being sarcastic
---
two suggestions. 
---
1) up the cost of maintaining sov in a system based on the number and type of structures. 
---
2) make low power structures decay (and require repair costs)
---
The old store was full of $200 designer stuff and was dumb. People reeeee'd for years "WE WANT TSHIRTS AND HOODIES!!!" You can now buy tshirts, hoodies, mugs, a lanyard if you're the kind of dork that's into lanyards, and at a pretty fair price. Yet still it's always "WE WANT SOME OTHER THING BECAUSE GETTING WHAT WE WANTED ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND I DIDN'T BUY OF IT ANYWAY AND I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T BUY A $500 SPACESHIP BUT I'M STILL MAD AND DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND PRODUCTION AT SCALE BETTER THAN YOU".
---
People forget that Eve Online isn't World of Warcraft or Fortnite. The playerbase isn't so big that you're going to see merch in Walmart. There's a lot of merch available that lines up with what people wanted for years, now it's there and who knows if anyone is even buying it. But it is there.
---
The merch is available up to 4x so no excuses. If you want to see more merch, support the merch that's available and practical for CCP to even bother messing with. Especially after they listened and gave us practical choices with a decent amount of variety. Ree all you want but I'm sure if you figure out how to build detailed, scale models of a few dozen ships and then not mass produce (because the playerbase isn't big enough), but also not have to 3d print one by one and charge a fortune they'd love for you to submit your resume for the moneitzation director job.

lowsec gate  (from khanid) to stain
---
I'm 100% certain that the only reason there is no lowsec gate to stain is because of stainguy's incessant bickering about it.
---
Not sure if cost is a thing that will improve the sys. There is simply to much money in the game. But if you only allow several citadels / sys then if the sys is filled there might be conflict. So content.

It always was a full time job.

that doesn't really look like the thing in the wire frame here, are you implying a shared architectural origin for drifter tech and trig tech?

less than half the month, and people probably went max krab the week before when they knew nerfs were coming.
---
super movement?
---
I have a couple questions which I have also seen asked in the community in various places Reddit included as well as in the game. My questions overlap with other folks questions.
---
1. Why is the CSM so skewed and not representative of playerbase ? Why are there so many CSM members from only certain regions of space while the others remain so unrepresented ? And to head it off with "because that is how players voted" is not acceptable answer, due to certain organizational and other limitations of players outside of NS. CSM basically does not represent playerbase as a whole. When will this change ?
---
2. When can we see some sort of structure rebalance, especially of timers and damage caps. Also with regards to taking out High Sec structures, when can we see some better way of taking them out which is currently disproportionally difficult due to High Sec not having capital ships.
---
3. When can we see some sort of changes that bring better NS accessability, especially for PvP, in light of things such as lack of nullified ships, multi bubble super and titan gate camps, system wide jammers, etc. All these are content denial mechanics that need to be addressed along with some other ones I am not mentioning, when can we see them "lightened" up substantially ?
---
4. Can we get some sort of a true and actual "catch up" mechanic, even partial that would work for players lets say only for players between 10 and 30 mil SP (the number could be TBD though and of course subject), that would be based on actual active game play instead of just $$$$ via injectors ? This doesn't have to be as powerful or as fast as injectors, but something, is better then nothing.
---
5. When can we see some FW and LS love in general ? FW really needs a lot of help, starting with limitations on caps, supers and and some structures. as it would make perfect sense lore wise since technically these are still Empire Navies territories.
---
6. Can we please get a rework on sec and faction standing losses obtained via PvP in FW and LS in general ? Its way out of whack right now turning off many people from participation, or limiting their participation as they have to periodically grind their standings back up or entirely switch characters.
---
7. Can we have some true game changes that address and very significantly lower the multi account requirements for many aspects of the game. This is causing a lot of people to get turned off from the game and log on and play a lot less or in many cases even quit entirely.
---
8. When can we see caps / supers become subject to EWAR in a meaningful way ? Especially from various EWAR specialized sub caps such as recon ships or EWAR sub system T3Cs.
---
9. When can we see Black Ops costs and utility / usability addressed as currently they have just too many limitations.
---
10. When can we see marauders usability addressed as currently they are in a horrible spot. Useless vs caps / supers as they were originally intended, and useless for PvE outside of High Sec due to root on bastion and hull costs.
---
11. When will you quit beating around the bush on sub cap / cap / super balance and just get rid of the giant balance cliff ?
---
So these are some questions I have just off the top. I'll come up with more.
---
Eve has been dying for about 15 years now
---
Haha!  Yeah.  Started as a tangential comment towards someone wanting to join EVE but not work toward success in the game, as most of us crusty, bitter vets have. But rather to be able to have equal abilities from the start. 
---
....it kinda evolved into a side bar convo.
---
When will Faction Warfare be overhauled or has it been abandoned?
---
Will the security mechanics for High Sec and Low Sec be reworked? I would be particularly interested in High Sec becoming a more balanced zone instead of the one sided easy mode for gankers that it currently is. Piracy is fine but it should be more balanced than having to be blown up first before you can do anything and even that system favors the pirates. At least put some actual ramifications in for criminal activity instead of what little there is now.
---
Is there any plan to overhaul Low Sec? It feels like there wasn't actually a plan for this. Almost every aspect of it feels half done. It has some real potential though.
---
Are there plans to improve PvE? The events are good but they need to be more than a copy and paste of each other. Abyssals are okay. Exploration is kind of pointless as is hacking in it's current state.
---
Will terrain ever matter? The fact that objects are just space bumpers is annoying. Objects don't block shots or hamper tracking/scanning/locking etc. Honestly, if you have the range available you could lock on and shoot someone on the far side of a planet. Decent piloting doesn't account for mush when all you need is range and lock speed.  /:(
---
It's a beautiful game and I think a lot of the mechanics are good. The training system is unique and I think it works well. It's just kind of boring and feels like a funnel that forces newer players into null alliances (which sucks tbh). It doesn't feel much like a sandbox at all. Honestly, I blame the players for that last part since the mechanics are there for the most part.
---
I assume this means you are completely done and wont be involved with it anymore, but will it still be up and running under rus? Wtb provi relay btw
---
Ty for the answer, gonna try and figure it out tonight. I started eve through steam but stopped cause it was tracking the amount I play, and tbh I had to stop it once it hit 3000hr.
---
Judging by how mad you are, which lossmail is yours? I bet it's the recon.
---
Servers all are shut down, I have the code and snapshots if I need them but I doubt it. I have no current desire to return to EVE.
---
It looks closer to when the sticks are fully assembled into a gate. I don't know what it exactly is... but it does look like the Drifter "gate" to me... 
---
Then again, I have been wrong at every step of the way so YMMV.
---
evemon can do that
---
Something something staingate
---
Careful, if your mom finds out you're a racist that she's gonna kick you out of the house.
---
Given that the poly count doesn't look really high it could certainly be a smaller ship with an odd design.
---
Why the fuck can't I buy models of the goddamn ships to put on my desk already?! People are printing them as a hobby and look damn good, I EXPECT BETTER.

CCP has claimed that the new data mining ability introduced by the Into the Abyss release allowed for far more data analysis detail and prompted much of the recent wardeccing mechanics changes. Please give us a couple of other examples where this new ability by CCP has revealed data that challenges any long standing belief or established gameplay mechanic that currently exists in EVE.
---
Cannot enlarge the first graph

Video was awesome. Ty

kk I thought I remembered something like that from four years ago.

Thanks!

Reading this post from that perspective, I can imagine the same for this one.

I got a mail from someone claiming to be a Triglavian Prince in need of my help to unlock their bank account. Anyone want to loan me 10b so I can see what happens?
---
Can you please share the file with community?
---
Maybe they could change wardecs to allow you to anchor more structures than the max limit in a war target sov system? That way wardecs will actually mean something for nullsec wars (beshides ganking in highsec).
---
And I've played the game for all of them? I think everyone knows Eve has always been small, specific game. If you think in it's current state Eve will last a another 5 years hats off to you because that is an impressive level of self-delusion.
---
Yea, 1) is more of a way to spread people out.  It also has the benefit of providing another sink to pull isk out of the game.  I don't think it would "fix" the problem, but it would help and doesn't seem to have many downsides (e.g. it doesn't hurt the "small" guy).
---
my opinion on this is, that you should never EVER post on reddit again...
---
Thx for reading!
---
/u/Kaladinar This question has already been answered by the developers.

Ceo said you were right, so I guess you were right
---
Please don't ruin my entertainment
---
Do they? I have always lived in apartments, never owned a house.
---
In EVE i just use NPC stations or structures of reliable corps. Never felt the need to deploy my own structures.
---
Wow someone’s mad about a post lol.
---
Hey I've been playing Eve for all of them, too. Cool. That doesn't somehow make you an expert on player retention. Be part of the solution. Make the game fun. Stop waiting for CCP to save you
---
Spoiler: &gt;!Turns out since it was something pvp players liked, so they complained and go CCP do comply. Many other such cases!&lt;
---
I don’t know what it is but I want one!
---
*looks naughty at Olmeca* 
---
But tbh I would just get a Farmhole instead of static farming.
---
^^ Shade Milith's Reddit handle ;-)
---
Which game mechanics does Hilmar currently see as the primary cause of rat-botting proliferation, and what does he intend to do about it?
---
Why didn't they use any of the plethora of tools available to identify botters and ban them instead of nerfing player income methods?  
---
The nerfs and buffs in this balance patch seem arbitrary at best.  Who said "You know what the cni needs? Drones!!" Nevermind the fact that you can't put a proper fit on it.  Who's decision was it to buff the abaddon's damage instead of giving it the only thing it's ever needed, capacitor?  Did they even consider the damage to the pvp viability of the vni when they stripped the entire drone speed bonus from it?  I can keep going, but it's all been said a thousand times in at least as many ways.
---
One final question:  Can you prove 100% that brisc broke the NDA?  We are not asking to see said proof, just have them acknowledge that it exists.
---
&gt;Cache
---
That's a slow clap for me, CCP is such a mess they even forget whole regions on their dumb MER
---
Fuck em
---
How about you just join a NS-static WH corp, you lemming
---
If the game is "dying" then how do you explain [THIS](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility)
---
Yes. DED sites 6/10 and equivalent difficulty, sometimes even higher depending on the site itself. As far as hostile space goes it is again up to each individual site as well as your personal proficiency and preferred playstyle. 
---
For example you may be able to do quite a bit while using covert sub system and on gated sites simply move away from the gate and take combat with you far enough from gate so that anything that comes through will become apparent and you will have an option to disengage. On the otehr hand for going higher then 6/10 you will have to fit one of the tanking sub systems, eitehr the shield HP or the active rep one. The shield HP sub system gives you further option of going passive and engaging very heavy neut focused content. It isn't as good as a Gila but still pretty nice and adequate.
---
C2 c5/null are my favorites whs to live in. And I am using those alts for PvP so didn't wanna commit them to farmholes.
---
Welcome to keepstar online
---
Seems pretty stable to me.
---
yes, solo rattle is the best imh. multiple T1 BS can work I suppose.

Gila is good, confessor is efficient if wolf rayet. full passif drake or myrm could work in the easiest anom.

That’s not anger. It’s a truth oracle telling you to consider giving up O2 intake while debating if you should post.
---
Nice article.
---
You followed orders and did nothing wrong.
---
The alliance application process will take a few weeks so you have time.
---
Yea, this is why I asked. Cause the way I fly my Tengus I'd just kill the geckos so those would be off the field eitehr being constantly recalled or destroyed. The medium drones would be a 50/50 on DPS vs my tank, actually, I think my tank would slightly beat their DPS, I might or might not have to kill any and the light drones I can just entirely laugh at and let them plink, they can be completely ignored.
---
Make it ramp up exponentially after a point.  At some point the money influx into the game can't keep up.

Killing blues when you are told to is one of life's simple pleasures.

now we have carriers so any subcap is useless anyways

Forward operating base
---
Citadels were a misstake
---
Theres a lot of assumptions people are throwing out that don't make sense, station guns for one.
---
Why would trigs change their weapon type?
---
We dont have any sense of scale or orientation because of the forced perspective of the wireframing.  
---
This could be a trig drone, or even technical readout for a single part of a ship, i.e. an engine.
---
We assume, because of out cultural bias that long pointy thing = gun.
---
We assume its big because of the capital shipyard, but really it could be anything at this point.
---
Yes i belive so myself. But do you see any way to backtrack? I find it impossible for CCP to delete them now.
---
the last time some rando company reached out to CCP and did a deal, it ended up really badly for everyone involved.
---
Well its the same thing with capital rebalance and supers / titans in the first place. No way to backtrack now and poses arent that much better.

---
Cool, where do I apply?
---
The opinion was about a rule the ceo made in the first place.
---
citadels are so much more aids than shooting a pos in every conceivable way
---
What are some low-SP options for a Cyno-alt to train into? Preferably less SP than interceptors.  I'm starting with fresh characters with all the neural-remaps available.   
---
I see a lot of Nereus, and the Ares was a popular option, anything I'm missing?
---
Lol thanks man.  I will drop in an app for your corp!  I must sadly admit that, since its been so long playing, I didnt understand some of the terminology (ie per tick, carrier rat, etc)  :)
---
It's the CEO's call to run his corp that way if he wants.
---
Seems like a good way to shrink one's corp, though. I'd think that simply not showing up to defend the non-discorded guys when they're attacked would send enough of a message.
---
racist &amp; disgusting

BECAUSE FUCK YOU AND YOUR PVE WAYS YA CUNT! FUCKING GO PVP AND MAKE ISK OFF THE BODIES OF YOUR FOES

REEEEEEEEEEEEEE

&gt; i am member of one of the renter corps

how could you pass the anti-bot captcha to post here? o.O
---
so i've played Mabinogi. it was a game that was active 9 years ago.
---
its been "dead" for 7 years. and yet its still got a playerbase, enough of one to have 4 servers still.
---
so i not worried about EVE dying. looking at its players. its stable https://i.imgur.com/6r6tWR7.png

Mabinogi
---
Who do you pay rent to. Stop paying rent and Goons will leave you alone. Probably.
---
A few observations and thoughts (many of which will be based around Winter vs. Legacy):
---
Can certainly tell a war is starting in Detroid with it shooting towards the top of the destroyed list. Probably would have passed The Forge if not for the long running Perimeter conflict.
---
In mining, its certainly easy to tell the value of standing fleets compared to ratting payouts.
---
Bounties took a very sharp tumble, and while the isk faucet net is still positive, that could be due to a lot less being confiscated from RMT/botting.  This also seems to be increasing the velocity of isk, though its too early to tell really on this trend or an anomalous spike.
---
Pandemic Horde would be where you want to go. However, you will be piloting said ships that are blowing up.
---
Please do an advertising blitz and get some new blood playing this great game :)
---
lol yea
---
Because BOT is affiliate with NC/PL all the income from BOT goes into their pocket, CCP took off casnio/passive moon mining from NCPL, test took off Perimeter Market from PH (another entity absolutely not related to NCPL) and now The Imperium is taking off their renter income.
---
Btw if you are a poor lonely BOT renter who do not see any answer from NC. beside the usual "Pay your rent or get out", Goons going to open their own rental program, without monthly payout and a lot of other advantage (good 10/10 isnt one of them btw grr BR 10/10)
---
Interceptors are THE first thing to train a cyno alt into. Besides, evasive maneuvering 5 is pretty important in this game.
---
Unpopular opinion but maybe because goons can’t fight actual PVPers without a strat fc...
---
Kill boys, don't drop caps on everything, stop using injectors, leave your alliance. There, you're helping. Seriously there are lots of balance issues with the game but Eve players love to complain a out the mechanics they are abusing. Just stop doing that.
---
so i can answer your #1
---
direct democracy.   this is why the US doesn't do popular votes.   because while technically you have the majority of the participating votes.   the minorities have no voice.
---
this is why US is a constitutional republic, so the rights of minorities are protected from the majority.
---
CSM could immitate this by having a certain number of nullsec seats, a certain number of FW,  Lowsec, highsec, pve, wh,  etc.
---
this WOULD mean that not everyone has an equal vote/voice(similar to how 1 vote in montana is worth like 42 votes in california), but it would give all minority groups(wh,lowsec,fw) voices instead of just null.
---
1. Brisc Rubal. A CSM ban I can understand, but; in-game?
---
2. PLEX pricing and manipulation.
---
3. Is CCP attempting to prevent power blocs from making money with the Rorqual changes?
---
4. Is CCP attempting to prevent non-power blocs from making money with the Rorqual changes?
---
5. The Triglavian capital ship, is it just a decoration or will it be flyable?
---
6. Why does it feel like CCP is getting smaller, with CCP Guard gone and all?
---
7. Why does spamming in Local NULL SEC get you a warning on your account, yet Jita is filled with spam?
---
8. Do you think Citadels are overwhelming? The grind to destroy them can be too much.
---
9. Why did player "X" experience seeing everything in Chinese (Overview, Dscan etc) while jumping from one Stargate into another system? (Yes, it happened to me, I thought I seen into Serenity, it was very weird and no it was in Esoteria, not FRT space).
---
10. Is CCP trying to get pilots to fly more subcaps and Dreadnoughts? Is there a steer away from Capital ships?
---
11. Will the Trigalvians attack Ansiblex Jump Gates and other Upwell Structures when they invade New Eden?
---
12. Is CCP going to be increasing the amount of ISK for a large percentage of the Skill Books that have remained the same price since 2003?
---
13. Will players be able to purchase "actual/literal" Skillpoints? If yes, then why do you think this will actually increase the playerbase? 
---
14. Why have so many CCP "icons", left CCP?
---
15. Any chance of interactive "lore" secret missions? For example, "The Mini-Monolith" in which someone thought of reprocessing, turned into "A Handful of Tiny Stars"; which apparently if brought to "The Monolith" (beside the Eve Gate), would react and "do something" if the player brought it to a certain point in space? We miss these things.
---
16. As a company, does CCP not hear the screams of those in low sec? No? That is because nobody is there. Player interest needs more research into making low sec interesting. Increasing the player-base should always be the number one thing a company should try to increase. Losing the residents of low sec is a sign something is wrong.
---
How does the future of the abyss look like?

---
I salute you
---
How do you tank in your Tengu when you don't have any cap? :)
---
One common path is to make fuel blocks. You probably will still have to buy some PI off the market though, as 3 toons can't provide enough.
---
I have heard that space superiority fighter apply decently to frig size ships      Is that correct?
---
Well, you are a source of income for someone, the person you pay rent to. There are powers that would like to see this income gone. You are not being directly targeted but since you are a source of income, you and everyone else under your banner will be shot/made to move away. It's mostly a power-grind between 2 large entities. But the fact that things are dying should maybe make you question why you pay rent to people who are letting you rent that place to begin with, if they won't help you, why are you paying them at all?
---
In the end, this is part of eve, a way of life mostly left undisturbed due to lack of motivation and agreements between big coalitions. But for the north east that quiet period has ended. Nothing in eve that is player built is permanent, it will all fall one day or another.

---
where did you get this screenshot of my farm hole
---
&gt; direct democracy. this is why the US doesn't do popular votes
---
Direct democracy doesn't mean it has to be subject to manipulations of all sorts etc.
---
Also, take for example US Congress, vs US Senate. One gets fair regional representation, while the otehr is subject to population fixing / manipulation / gerrymandering, etc. Both are direct democracy, there is no electoral college for congress or senate seats, or if there is, then unlike POTUS elections, they never override but rather coincide with popular vote.

---
Seriously dude, just stop renting.
---
Go find a group that actually wants you around for what you wanna do in eve, not just exploit you for isk like BOT does. 
---
Alternatively, drone lands are a content haven right now, so this is a great time to actually pvp and experience an exciting part of eve. Although, you’d enjoy it more if you were on the winning side probably.
---
Go find a small-medium sized group and create chaos somewhere. Eve needs more diverse groups, and a lot less blue donuts and rental empires.
---
&gt; poses arent that much better. 
---
They are in one major way. They didn't have beacons. I think CCP should remove beacons from  the M/L structures. They our overviews would be so much clearer.
---
Well how do you plan to use this cyno alt?
---
* Lighting a cyno on a Keepstar for your personal cap to jump to that can survive some light pewing? Passive-regen Nereus, the more T2 tank the better.
---
* Going behind enemy lines so the FC can jump his cap fleet in strategically? Interceptor or Stealth Bomber.
---
* A cheap, unreliable version of the same thing for personal use? Any T1 frigate.
---
Depends what am doing. I may be passive or hybrid, especially if the site contains sleepers i'll be fit entirely for "cap free" operation making neuts irrelevant, or may be fit with batt + booster on top of cap sub. Also no need to tank it for long, just a long enough to kill geckos, maybe even 1 Gecko. I use various fits. The only 1 where I see myself getting fully neuted is if I go full active, which is actually rare.
---
same
---
You’ve gone about it completely the wrong way. I’ll tell you why.
---
1. Your making of ships out of cardboard tells me nothing about your social status. It could be that you’re a cardboard genius. Who am I to speak up about that, I can’t draw two parallel lines without a ruler. If you’re looking for someone to critique someone else’s artwork, you came to the wrong guy.
---
2. Fanfest is accessible with a wheelchair [if you are using one] without an issue. I’ve known other pilots who are using one, it’s just not an issue. You would be able to use the elevators.
---
3. You could have said, in /r/EVE: I want to go to Fanfest. I can’t, I’ve no money, but I’ve got this idea about making star ships out of cardboard [with pictures of star ships made out of cardboard] and I’d like to talk to someone about that. EVE is notorious for being a bunch of certifiable assholes. And that is a deserved reputation. It is also known [because I’ve seen it] for having some of the most generous people in a game. Your gofundme page would have seen some bucks thrown into it to help you make the trip [I’ve actually contributed to someone’s journey to go to Iceland for that precise reason [I’m not calling myself generous or a good person, my asshole armour must have had a crack in it that day].
---
4. If you had a product of sufficiently high quality [that’s going to be a must], people would show an interest. I’ve seen cardboard models of game items that amazed me with the quality of the work.
---
5. EVE is a collective hallucination. If you established that you had a serious plan for making something and that you were able to get there [as in: be able to create something on a realistic time scale] with the right tools, there’s no telling what would be possible. But: you have to reach out to people. 90% of life is showing up. It really is. I have embraced a Playboy Playmate because I went to Fanfest [I am not joking, that’s actually true, I have pictures :-)]. You just have to show up, be open to the experience, see where it takes you.
---
Go and do likewise. I’m willing to accept you know how to make a great product. Your task is to find a way to elevate the experience. Having a handicap and not a lot of money are two fantastic hurdles, I’m not making light of it. That’s your challenge to overcome. If the soup between your ears is not mush, and you played EVE for years, I’m going to say you should be doing fine in that department, you want to find a way to overcome those limitations. A handicap is a problem in so many ways, it can’t be your defining characteristic. The story is not: /u/Paper_crafter has a handicap. It’s your harsh reality but that can’t be who you are. The story is: /u/Paper_crafter makes amazing models for a spaceships-on-the-internet game. Why could that not be you [if that is what you want]? You’re going to want to front load that: I’ve made model#1, model#2, model#3, model#4, model#5 is in the works. This is what they look like. I’m running into a few issues: list your problems. Can someone help?
---
You’d be surprised what’s possible.
---
I wish you good luck. If you ever make an Orca or a Naga, show me a picture, I’ll buy one off of you.
---
LOL WHAT? That's a thing!?
---
Did't even pay a fine, cagali went full "both sides are in the wrong" and ignored it. Hero (and Brave in paticular) was insanely dysfunctional. My favorite Hero story was on a join hero fleet op where someone dropped the hard r in a super edgey, brave nerds got super offended and instantly blamed test, and then it was pointed out that it was a brave guy who said it and the same people who were insanely offended laughed it off or shut up.
---
Will look in to that. Ty
---
not quiet.
---
while US Senate is limit 2 per state.   US Congress seats work the same way as electoral college,  with the number of seats having artificial limits and minimums, so that a vote for a congress representative again has a different value based on where you live.
---
for example, a congress rep is equal to another.
---
but while one congress rep might be elected by only 4200 people in a small state.    the other might have been elected by over a million.
---
this is not direct democracy,  but artificially limited. as obviously if you in the small state, your vote was worth more than if you were in the larger.
---
as for gerrmandering,  that is interstate.  the state's artificial number of representatives or electoral votes,  is then divided inside the state.  these areas are yes, direct democracy.  but only in their small areas.
---
Eve kills your real-life relationships
---
Nice b8 m8
---
I totally see your point. Thing is some newbros might not always try those whereas everyone eventually tries missions.
---
&gt; Remove asset recovery.  
---
&gt;Fixed.  
---
&gt;I think Asset recovery (If it must remain) should behave in similar fashion to loot drops. When a structure is popped, each item within has a 50% chance of being recovered in lowsec. For the ones that aren't recovered, treat them exactly like loot drops where half is destroyed and half dropped. Killing cits will be a lucrative venture and they'll die in droves.
---
Cheers, that's what I get for attempting to multitask.
---
Jesus.  I would expect a 9b active fax to be very difficult to kill.  I'm not sure how long he can inject for though.  He'll burn through those injectors pretty fast.
---
Maybe
---
We'll see
---
Also, that person is now podded and out of the wormhole and unable to help defend it.
---
Create a skill plan in evemon and import the fitting
---
can i have your stuff?
---
I don’t understand what’s going on
---
There isn't a set list for this because literally any ship can kill almost any other ship reasonably speaking. It's more about how you fly your ship and if your enemy has friends usually
---
nope.  cause it depends on what fit, how are your skills, what actions do you take. what actions they take.
---
though a simple guide(though not accurate)  would be, if you are same tech as them, but 1 size higher(destroyer vs frig,   cruiser vs dessy, bs vs bc)  then your usually good.
---
for the most part, no advice will help. and its up to trial and error by you.
---
You must be in delve

2nd racial Dread option when?

i wanna live in trig space, wich is like wormholes, but for cool kids™

why does unspoken want to evict their main source of content lmao
---
Raid; Kills bugs dead.
---
You pay rent to their opponents.
---
It's just like harassing an opponent's economy in a real-time strategy game, e.g., destroying lumber mills, mines, etc., which produce resources they will use to defeat you.
---
Microgangs usually have support like Keres etc mixed with anti-tackle these days. AFs are very efficient with small groups due to their cost, so they're used a lot. Confessor is still decent, kikimora is the bomb since it covers most roles.
---
I found the cradle of the naked singularity in the video. It's fully visible at the 6s mark coming from the 7 o'clock position of the frame. Based on the design of the cradle in other trig ships, it's safe to assume that the vid is oriented upright and goes from back to front. Also, the long "barrel" at the front is not a barrel, since the singularity is a power source and not a weapon. We can't be sure about the size because the cradle generally scales up with size. However, my personal guess would be an AF or a drone/fighter.
---
That’s why he will have dsts full of cap charges and stront with him. Same principle applies if you go for a cheaper fit. Inject and rep on the same tick and neuts do almost nothing. It just makes the fax pilots job pretty involved with managing charges and getting reps of on subs and himself in time. I’d honestly love to see the removal of capital cap injectors and a return of combat refitting
---
If everything happens on a once-per-second tick, how does activation order play into this?
---
EX: I have 8 smartbombs on a disco BS. I fit 3 EM and 5 Thermal and activate them in that order on the same tick. Does it all fire at the same time anyway? Does the system know I hit the EM ones first, even if it seems to activate them all at the same time?
---
EX: two ships are at 1pct structure. They activate guns on eachother 0.2s apart within the same tick. Does the person who shot first survive as the server knows they hit fire first? Or do both die?
---
Hahahaha please give me more tales of old Eve blunders, they make me chortle and my sides wobble.

Will you take over the C5 rental program?  Since HK was evicted I am not sure who to pay my rental check to and now I fear eviction.
---
Angel Titan when?
---
&gt; people who just want to do there own thing
---
Go play some single player games, I heard Stellaris is pretty great and is also about spaceships and shits.
---
Wrong.
---
Our content is to evict. Has been for 2 years now. The entire time we fought the remainder of the Russians around ER/The Spire. There is always someone to evict, there is always people to hunt. It doesn't need to be dronelands, it can be anywhere in nullsec.
---
Can you link a Rattlesnake ratting fit that you like?
---
wait you quit, after I loan you 2bil to re-sub.....wtf
---
&gt;I get that putting up citadels is much easier than dealing with the old starbases.
---
In some ways. You can do all of your configuration while docked inside. That's easier.
---
But putting them up and taking them down requires a lot more time and since the cit has a beacon, even the most no-erffort player can see it in space and know when it'll be vulnerable. They also take a week to unanchor so those aspects are much worse for the owner.
---
Where I really wish they could replicate a POS is the RF. One timer after shields are down and then you can kill it. Go ahead and let them set the day of the defense but make it so that it happens on the very next time that day happens, even if it's a &lt; 24 hour window. If that's supposed to be your corp/alliance's most active day, you shouldn't need a week or more put up a defense fleet.
---
I keep asking but my ceo never says yes
---
The last time Cache appeared in the MER is September of 2018.  The October MER of that year dropped both Fade and Cache, Fade got added back in that November, but Cache has been absent ever since.
---
Honestly not sure if CCP knows how many regions are in their own game.
---
😍
---
Unspoken recently got evicted, so we are looking for a new place to call home. Who can I contact for pricing? Are ihubs (&amp; upgrades) included?
---
RLML RR Sacs in a C5 C13 are fun, too.
---
anti capital beacon thingy, kinda like the anti drone things in the sites
---
SOE armor FAX when??
---
Now just plex each of those accounts for 2 months and you'll have the 5m sp required to extract and CCP will have their $40 for every free account.
---
So we should point newbros to them at every opportunity. Manual piloting, situational awareness, priority targeting, drone management are all very hard to teach with text or voice description but all will be learned to a small degree at very least from abyss pretty quickly. 
---
Missions below level 4 are almost entirely pointless except for fixing standings and essentially force newbros to stay in highsec (I know theres lowsec and nullsec mission agents, but realistically how many newbies are using them?) while abyssals are accessible from anywhere, wanna move to a newbie nullsec/wormhole corp? No problem, you can still run abyssals.  
---
Missions are fixed content that never changes at all, abyssal spawns are different in every room so it never gets stale. And again, the barrier for entry in t1 abyss is t1 cruisers with potential to recoup the investment several times over within one 20minute site, vs agent missions being practically a waste of time in anything that isn't at very least a well skilled battleship in lvl4s.
---
None of this is to say I disagree with the idea of giving missions a little love, christ knows they need it, just saying it's gonna be a pretty hard sell when we've just got probably the biggest PvE update in the history of Eve less than a year ago.
---
serious sam 5
---
if it is, it only goes to one region
---
Sorry Ihubs are not included due tragic jump freighter accident in lowsec. We have terminated relations with said jf pilot and are awaiting our next shipment to ER. Remember keep calm and rent on!
---
At least you had to have a somewhat vulnerable rep fleet for a pos
---
Wormhole dude.
---
he wouldn't answer because that's what this entire year is about
---
Last seen mining ice
---
I honestly think anybody who is miffed/curious about Brisc deep down just wants better transparency about these kinds of events with the parties involved. There's a clear pattern of "ccp makes decision, decision final, go fuck yourself" that is a bit concerning - there should be a better path for players to appeal/discussion said decisions with CCP.
---
they will never answer the last one.
---
especially because ccp never publicly stated that he broke the nda. reread their release
---
"So what do you suggest CCP should i bring 5 accounts to fight single frigate?"
---
No, just one, in a frig, you should be able to get a gud fite.
---
The average age of an eve players is probably 30. Not a lot of kids in this game and you would be hard pressed to find a corp of only teens. I highly doubt there is one.
---
This not gonna end well
---
No. SS fighters suck at everything BUT killing other fighters and drones I guess. I have tested this in the past.
---
SS fighters are for fighting the "fighter war" in the big set-piece engagements while the rest of the fleet does its thing. Once one side clears all the other side's SS fighters, then their supers can launch their expensive fighters and start applying damage while the their carrier buddies continue to protect them with their surviving SS left over from the fighter war.
---
I don’t think you’re going to find a Corp of only teens. I think your best bet would be to look around at a different corps and just find a group of people that you get along with.
---
Ironic seeing as how Goons have more members that BOT, input broadcast, etc.
---
Remind me again how many BOT Titans/Supers/Carriers got dragged to Yulai?
---
So, you want the benefit without the drawback? 😂
---
But seriously, I agree this does require some attention

If he's based in China, there's very little they could do without some big Chinese dick to do the ass fucking for them.

What is a polarized ship? Read something here abt a polarized vindi, what does that mean?
---
Will we be ever to buy EVE merch with reasonable shipping prices in the EU/UK.  I know we have Brexit but we still have money.
---
I am in pandemic horde right now
---
Form what i understand they were not owned but had Borrowed form investors to start up then, put on more dept with the investors with the other games they tried to do. Then the investors wanted out so they went to pearl abyss. Unless you got other information but this is what I got form the new i read about it. so going public would have made some since.
---
then you're with your kind
---
Do he REALLY believe injector are good for the game and it's used by newplayer and not a speculative "money" only for rich player ?   
---
what about skillfarm it is healthy aswell ?
---
I know at least 20 people who does NOT play EVE but LOVES space and stuff and I'm pretty sure they would love to have spaceship model on their desk.
---
It's not necessarily only players who buys stuff, yes stupid shit like t-shirts is for nerds and am personally not interested at all in this garbage, but spaceship models? completely different story.
---
Even papermodels would be super great, but ... whatever.
---
Good luck, there are younger folks playing the game, just probably spread out.
---
I'm still looking for the corp that is into shamanism, the occult, and anime, lol.
---
That's all these guys do all day. And they aren't spending this isk on pvp stuff.
---
Do you think someone has copied your program?
---
Do you think by you leaving, this will stop or change anything?
---
How many games "start ups" have you run into the ground even before they took off?
---
fckin savage ayyyyyyyyyy
---
I could put a post on r/teenagers
---
There are weapons that are "polarized" - they deal more damage, but they reduce your ships shield armor and hull resistances to 0. So basically a polarized ship means that it has those polarized weapons fitted but it has no resistances to any damage type whatsoever (less EHP)
---
Nobody has the source code for polaris and its assets but myself. People can replicate the basic bit if they know what they are doing. If people alliances follow some of the ideas above it will make it break current intel systems ans make it harder to implement new ones
---
I'd recommend [https://sov.space/](https://sov.space/)  for a great site for visual references to space and territory owned for a new player.  It will also help you understand various Coalition locations with PanFam (Pandemic Family), Imperium, Legacy, etc. and you can see it paired down by the individual alliances themselves.  Its not 100% accurate, but close enough.
---
If you're gonna try to burn someone it helps to proofread your post at least enough that someone can make sense from it.
---
The ratio size of those scaffolding bars are unrealistic. Given the sheer size of that thing when put beside a Keepstar, each scaffolding bar would be the width of an entire city block.
---
Oof, I understand why you want to leave :p (karmafleet is always recruiting btw)
---
Its not about what is more effective in a PvP situation. Its about who puts the best spin on things in reddit and has the best reasons why things didnt go their way

Now are you going to return the billions that you borrowed from Grimm?

---
Thanks for verifying that. I guess, just like real-world systems; things such as "meme's" are hard to filter out. Pings being pinged in meme-format  (jpg etc) really would be a nice way of avoiding intel being leaked via this known method.
---
Ah! I have a few! 
---
- Is CCP currently really focused/interrested in new player retention? If yes, how is CCP going to change the new player experience as it can be extremely overwhelming in its current form? (There have been numerous posts about this)
---
- Can CCP be more transparant about the fight against bots in the form of numbers?
---
To shine some more light on these two questions: CCP Falcon said something along the lines of 'over a thousand/thousands of characters are being created every week' in another tread (the one about players having racist names, can't find it on my phone) and it made me wonder if the new player retention is really that bad or if the botting problem is much bigger than we (I) expected.
---
- Can (ship)balances be introduced regularly? For example every summer of every april? This would give the playerbase something to hold on to as currently nobody knows when balances hit. It could be a year, but it could be 3 as well. Doesn't always have to be as big as the last balance, but i think the point is clear.
---
- Are certain (future) skills going to be excluded from skill injectors/skill points? Even though I agree on CCPs statement that skill injectors allow new players to catch up to veterans (Instead of forever being years of skill points behind), I also think a certain barrier for new players could be healthy for the game.

I *am* unsubbed.... now might be the perfect time

Snuffed Outs leadership is 14 and 16 year old , maybe try there
---
Tau is legal in most countries just sayin
---
Now that walking in stations is gone, to my knowledge, my clone has not let his pod.  How do they bathe?
---
This is what neutral alts are for :-)
---
Until someone plugs an intel system into a text analysis algorithm to workout pings.
---
Search "Not a SOTA" on YouTube. That's the average age of the Eve community these days.
---
17. Why are you running CCP Games into the ground? tia fam
---
Not really - anoms reset at DT and you cannot anchor a structure before it since it takes 24h.
---
Can you do delve next. I'll help.
---
nothing disrupts warp like a 280mm volley straight into the engines
---
this made me laugh
---
btw dont care for those who bot to play.
---
would of picked a different handle for the bot alliance
---
Karmafleet is one of the largest member corps in the imperium. This means that there are a bunch of different people of varying ages and interests, so you will be able to find a group that you fit in with (tbh everyone in karma is super friendly so you’ll probably just fit in with everyone). In addition we are a part of the imperium so you get access to all the perks of being in the largest coalition in the game. You can pm me if you want more information.

+1 this closed up my old flat, emptied a can of raid and went off to work.
---
Came back and my fruit fly infestation was sorted.
---
Also you get the added excitement of not knowing if your flat will be engulfed in flame while you are out! 
---
Highly recommended.
---
You see it as picking on you,  but we are trying to save you from the oppressive protection racket you operate under.
---
 Here's a word: *gratitude*
---
I love the contrast between poster name and the post.
---
is that region stain?
---
Dont be retarded....
---
What’s snuffed out like?
---
Impressive work, this looks very professional and i want to buy all. BUT where is the levitating Nyx ? :p
---
Why would you want to join a corporation lead by a teenager?
---
Because I’m a teen
---
Asset safety was a mistake
---
Past two days you can’t even dock in wh space if you had overheated you guns - have to log out and log back in.  They allready broke it
---
like the people i hang with and where i am at. the occasional or daily pvp roam though tend to add to the fun.
---
Take them with you
---
Mainly because he’s been caught out as a scammer and won’t be able to use Nocti to scam any more.
---
Just gotta keep anchoring til u have every potential anom spawn covered obviously.
---
YOU JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND DAD!!!
---
maybe, gotta ask u/stainguy , he is the guy w/ the scoops when it comes to that
---
Is it true that the ban on CCP employees being in null-sec alliances has been lifted? That's a rumor I keep hearing from weird enough places that I wonder if there is anything to it.
---
Nah what i had seen was much more basic and less detailed.
---
Alright. Let's say you're a person who has a bunch of bot nyxes, and you have to set up somewhere.
---
You can rent your own system or five in the drone regions, and be mostly left alone. You can put up your own poses for warpouts. There are very few roaming gangs, and no NPC space where dreads can stage.
---
Or you can go to delve.
---
Every system is cloaky camped. Roaming gangs burn through every 30 minutes or so. Every system already has 2-5 supers or carriers ratting, people are BFG ratting all over the place. Dreadbombs are happening several times a week since NPC space covers almost the whole region. A dozen different groups are hunting supers all the time.
---
Why do people think our space is some sort of botter mecca? It's a shit show.
---
Great insight. Thank you.
---
This is a pretty good starting point for learning how different ships/metas match up but it takes some time to figure out what you can engage with what.
---
That doesn't change the math. And shit if it doesn't matter to them; cool. Good for them. Blowing shit up is inherently fun
---
LEAVE BOT ALONE, THEY ARE INNOCENT KRABS!!!
---
Thats 100% what I do. No need to pay the rent in a videogame you already pay the subs to play.
---
Jump drake pilots have no souls.

Pvp centered low sec group pretty good guys origin doesnt have teens per say but we have alot of younger people as well

1v1 statistics based on zkill, gives you a a somewhat decent idea of the percent change you will win a 1v1
---
Because you're easy prey? 
---
Because content?
---
Because people are bored and EVE is a pvp game?
---
Because renters are absolute trash?
---
If it's in low sec now a days it normally goes something like this:
---
If it's one frig only one cyno and a single titan will do.
---
Anything more than one frig you can call in as many caps as you can.
---
If only we had like, a forum or something like that to post stupid shit like this on.
---
We may as well. The big donuts egos are too fragile to risk trying. 😂
---
GLOBAL DOCK UP YOUR FACTION TITANS
---
There are probably only 3 teenagers who even play this game
---
good luck finding them
---
You know theres a reason that we generally don't let Teens run things yeh?
---
To be honest, you want this, you are gonna have to build it. 
---
Noone in Eve gives a shit how old you are, i've played with 13 year  olds and 80 year olds.
---
The 13 year old was actually a director in my corp and i still play with him 6 years later.
---
Uncle Carl might have been an accident baby a decade or two after their sibling 😉
---
Well, if he was heading back to k-space in an empty pod- you just saved him some time with a free ride home anyhow.
---
&gt; I know at least 20+ people in my sort of close circle who does NOT play EVE but LOVES space and stuff
---
This is exactly my point. It seems like a bigger market than it is because of an echo chamber effect. I love space stuff but I'm not gonna buy models from Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous. It makes perfect sense that CCP offers merch that it does. Low risk, easy inventory to manage.
---
The $2,000 failure of a Nyx is a perfect example of doing it wrong, definitely a lesson learned.
---
I just realized that lol
---
Because honestly that is the end goal for most corps. A little production structure that makes them feel like they have made it to the next level.
---
Now, something did just occur to me. Maybe limit the number of structures a corp can have in highsec. But again, unless the blue list of a corp is severely restricted and people are hard limited on alts that doesn't solve the holding corp problem.
---
\~Baaaaalaaaaannncceeee\~
---
I need proof of this. 
---
My corp spent weeks trying to find a subcap capable of soloing c4 sites, and turns out the best way (because cost at the time) was RR domi's, minimum 3. Or a marauder. 
---
And yes, I've seen the solo rattlesnake videos, but they don't work anymore.
---
what? Can you translate?

stupid redditor can't understand the point and procedure of a public execution

I've been playing since 2009 and have probably quit 2009 times

---
IT’S NOT A PHASE
---
SOE is totally gonna have a Fax and a carrier =D
---
They moved the undock button at some point.
---
because you can hit 1 button when you see red and be safe
---
How would you like it to differ from the current dread offering?
---
Make a toon called "Jack" then start your own corp for teens called 'Lord of the Flies' for the memes
---
If you only care about the age of your corporation members you’ll find the same thing in all the open newbie corporations such as Karmafleet or Pandemic Horde.
---
PM Torpedo Tits ingame and I got you a fit when I hit the house.
---
Reason for goons, no idea probably something to do with where your rent goes?
---
For unspoken, I think you guys started the sov war with them.
---
For hawks, content, fun and because you didnt pay Peleus. It's really funny that maybe two or three people messing with sov kicked all this off. 
---
Also I dont think you can play the little guy card considering both NC and Pan Fam show up to timers and you get told to stay at home half the time because killboard stats.
---
Ratting is a lot easier to profit from as a botter.
---
Yeah, I doubt that the anom respawn timer changes were aimed at curbing botting. Bots don't care how long the sites take to respawn; they just edit the config file or change a constant or whatever and trundle along. Shoot, they might even be sophisticated enough to just handle it in stride. :iiam:
---
Respawn timer changes just affect how many krabs a single system can support. Botters need exclusivity to work properly, so they generally just have their own bots in any given system.
---
Isn't that because they got rid of input broadcasting or whatever it's called?
---
According to his AMA, they get something like 10,000 new players trying the game per month. But because of the steep learning curve and poor new player experience, most don't last past that 30 days.
---
They are good enough I'll give it a pass
---
Shut up and fly through Brave's staging system like a man!
---
kk Thanks!
---
To be fair, clownshoe tanks aren't the best thing to base your "I can't do enough damage" stats on.
---
Maybe call them something like Assault Missile launchers. 
---
Made to fit onto cruiser type hulls, but higher capacity and slightly faster RoF!
---
^^^&gt;!username!&lt;
---
Thankfully I'm currently exploring in a Heron. Died a couple times in WHs so I know to work in the cost of replacements.
---
imagine kikis with locus coordinators haha
---
Teens are perfect for Origin because they can courier Elo's cocaine and if they get busted they are still considered minors.
---
Where dreads can't stage? Hahahahaha.
---
Do you know how many times we get dropped on by caps, that according to you can't get there.
---
Here just the most recent one that comes to memory:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75460672/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75460672/) 
---
The difference between our space and yours is, we don't have a super cap umbrella. So they don't require dreads. In our space, the 10 man gang with sub caps can generally get a few good kills, so they dont need the dreads. Its not that they don't exist.
---
And for the record, Venal &gt; MTO2 &gt; Malpais so you are a single gate away. Which most major groups either have a Fort (or are blue to a Fort) in HD-
---
But hey, if were such a "mecca" I mean the MER reports should show it right? I mean we are the 5th largest Alliance by systems owned, and 6th by Members. 
---
Huh man, look at that 7th in mining (fairly respectable), and ***20th*** in isk.
---
I thought it was now against the eula or tos to offer ingame isk for out of game contests... if not i want gambling back
---
i guess we could just improve heavy missiles a bit more.
---
...but without adding the improvement to rapid heavy
---
This entire game has just become Null-Bear catering.
---
This is good for you, but 99% of the people that I see in Wormholes that are flying Tengus are using an active shield tank (most of them oversized) and don't know how to properly defang.
---
Technically it's not "safe" to mine anywhere.
---
Even though I know it's not true, judging by the absolute lunacy of most of the people I've met in local recently (looking at you, Great Wildlands) there are a lot of teenagers who play Eve.
---
Actually, there are reasonable and responsible teenagers, so I should clarify.
---
Recently, I've found there are a lot of assholes who are mentally teenagers that play Eve.
---
Piggy
---
 the ass frig meta/buffs completely trivialized them tbh.
---
At the speed you and your alts entosis stuff, we couldn't lose :D
---
Does he need some company? Being in denial sounds way better than knowing that there is no AT this year.
---
before rapid light missile launchers, Assault Missile Launchers existed.

They did the things I said above.

I still prefer those to the RLMLs.

Imagine having only two brain cells and using one of them to post on reddit.

I bet you think cloaky camping is a broken mechanic too.
---
Elite Dangerous has been tons of fun lately.
---
Safe from rats? Or safe from getting ganked?
---
You'll probably be okay fending off rats.
---
But you're more likely to get ganked, since the lower the System Sec, the slower Concord responds.
---
STICK YOUR PENIS IN IT
---
Never 100% safe but you can do some things to help. 
---
Learn to use D-scan and use it to watch for groups of ganking ships, fit as much tank to your ship as you can and  set ganking corporations to red so you know when they enter local

safe you vs save you is a pretty dumb hill to die on.

A lot of these questions are negative will put him on the defensive unless reworded. I don't think there's any opportunity to take snipes at Hilmar; find questions that can be asked that you might expect an actual answer

The main issue I see with citadel spam is that you get linear improvments with linear increases in costs. Putting down 2x fortizars in a system doesn’t cost 2.5x, it costs 2x. That’s just so...backwards for eve. Of course that line of thought is usually used with better modules costing lots more, but it could be applied to help citadel spam.
---
Smh
---
People live in GW?

*sigh*

Take your upvote, you earned it

Just add a teaspoon of liquid soap to the ectoplasmic liquid that your pod is filled with and BAM clean capsuleer!
---
Use a skiff or an orca in hisec, macks only need one or two catalysts to go down
---
You **can** be safe. But most people are too retarded for that.
---
I believe most, if not all Eve players would want OP to ask Hilmar about a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
God fuckin' damn Versoth
---
It's fun to have an identity; this is a reasonable answer. If you can make it work, more power to ya. Good luck!
---
No, .5 is prime ganking land
---
One more turret, appropriately reduced tank baked into base stats. So it won't require any special modules or role bonuses tacked on to justify it but will play situationaly different then existing dreads. This would make it a good option for dread bombing and operations against supercapitals but more vulnerable to subcaps. 
---
So essentially the Megathron to say the Moros' Dominix.
---
(So 33% more offense, 33% less base durability) 
---
Another option would be the Dread equivalent of a Mothership, more guns, more raw primary function, way bigger requirements. Just designed to stomp caps hard. However I think there would be less appetite for that.
---
Hey akage! :)

Find a corp on the Eve forums or on /r/evejobs and mone in nullsec or even a wormhole.

You’ll soon wonder why you bothered with highsec for as long as you did
---
The nadhugger also has a hazard control skin making it superior regardless
---
I guess thank you for proving my point further, that claiming the absence of NPC stations in a region &lt;&gt; enemy capitals cant reach you.
---
why tho
---
So it's unlikely I could have your stuff?
---
They are numbers, CCP could give away as many as they want
---
Unpopular Opinion: There should be a limit on the number of structures you can anchor in a single system.
---
It's Horde but in Goons.
---
Am now working on it, thanks for the inspiration!
---
Short of an in system FOB or incursion, there is no credible current PvE threat even down at .5.
---
But don't worry, there are plenty of people willing to fulfill that role for you, permit or not.

I'm blue red colorblind

I believe that's a very popular opinion

I could not even get close to the stash before the leshaks were on top of me!
---
If such a thing exists posting about it on reddit is probably a bad idea. Congregations of online teens attract the worst kinds of creepers.
---
Only among people who can't imagine spamming structures as an area denial strategy. Hit the limit and no more roach motels.
---
I've only been playing around 230 days and have been enjoying all of it, yeah its still a bit hard doing some stuff but if you join one of the bigger corps it helps
---
Just tell me which system you have in mind and I'll clear it for you.
---
autistic
---
There's no benefit at all in moving from a 0.6 to a 0.5 the ore in them is exactly the same.
---
There's not even any point mining in a 0.6, mine in Caldari space and mine Plagio which you can find in a 0.7.
---
The ONLY reason to go below a 0.7 in high-sec to mine ore is if you're mining moons and that means you have to be in a 0.5
---
A Mack makes CODE. very excited so don't mine afk and keep d-scanning so you spot their neutral scanning alt before it finds you. Look for combat probes in a pvp d-scan and dock up when you see more than one on the scan.
---
The photos of it on screens emit light
---
Nah those drones will only be good for rats. Just keep your eye on local and aligned to a station
---
Cannot disagree with you in the slightest.
---
Personally, missions are a guilty pleasure for me. I do them in weird ships on my PVE toon when I don't feel like checking local and spamming dscan.
---
Which system and what time?
---
The overlap of eve players and teenagers is very small, especially since 1/2 of teenagers are younger than the game. I’ve been playing about a year and a half and have met two outside of the friends I tried to get into the game. Most of the teens that do play are probably spread out pretty wide, and would have different interests and places they like to live.
---
:sweats:
---
Albeit now an adult, I'm technically still in my teens (and I started playing EVE when I was still a minor), so I'm probably better equipped to answer this question than the denizens of elderly and toothless bittervets that frequent this subreddit.
---
The short answer is that there's a reason (apart from teens being a small demographic in EVE) that corps aren't generally run by teenagers, and that the ones that are often fail. No matter how mature you are, teenagers are still developing intellectually and emotionally. This often results in unnecessary drama, general immaturity, and disastrous interpersonal interactions, all of which aren't conducive to a corp's health.
---
I joined EVE for the game; I've stayed for the friends I've collected along the way— people who are intelligent, kind, mature, and trustworthy. You should try to find a corp full of these people, IMO— not a group of people that might seem easier to relate to on the surface. 
---
*tl;dr it's a bad idea, pls donut do*
---
Is this a display bug or is it really doing that damage?
---
unless N is low enough for pilot skill and tactics to matter
---
they were a spy anyway
---
why else aren't they on comms
---
&gt; imagine kikis with locus coordinators haha
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Dreddit is recruiting
---
*snip snip*
---
How much harder is it too kill those keeps without anchoring a staging cit?
---
Low power needs to remove tether ability as well imo. This would massively help and force corps to put down the money for fuel to have their caps have immunity at the very least, but subs could still just dock in low power.
---
Lmao. You're not quitting "because you feel like you aren't progressing". You got blacklisted for scamming alliance members and lying about irl shit.
---
No. If you mine in Highsec use a Procurer or Skiff and tank them appropriately. Everything else is designed to be easy content for gankers, so pathetic is the tank.
---
Gotta be in comms.  Period.
---
Pretty sure he's calling you an moron buddy.
---
Lmao he's not quitting, he got blacklisted and wanted to lie again. He got blacklisted for scamming alliance members and lying about irl shit.
---
Is your point really that we should be able to anchor more hard-to-kill citadels in order to kill the other hard-to-kill citadels? Do I understand your point correctly?
---
You got blacklisted for scamming alliance members and lying about irl shit. And here you are, lying again.
---
But there are plenty of corps where 30 year olds *act* like teens.
---
They did not use the words "broke the nda" what they said was... "Brisc Rubal has been found to be sharing confidential information".  What kind of information does an NDA protect?  This is more than implication.  It literally means "broke the nda".  
---
Most of all, it's the thing that people want to know.  "Do you actually have any, internal to ccp, evidence that proves your claims?  Something that could not be explained any other way?"  I really hope they do.
---
thanks asshole has new meaning to me.
---
He can't he got blacklisted
---
Ask about gate to Stain
---
Once POSes are removed it'll be interesting to see the MER results; every bot i've encountered uses a safe tower.
---
They can and they do. A lot.
---
Of course he did because he sounds like a 13 year old.
---
\^ This. From someone who mines moon goo in a .5 system, and ganks miners in a .5 system. :)
---
The way I see it, the ability of upwell structures to be spammed along with rorq proliferation which was definitely helped by said spamming of structures caused a shift from pvp focus to a "getting bigger toys" focus for some eventual end game of capital combat, but the problem is everyone has so many big toys that it's basically impossible to commit them in any large fashion without the possibility of losing so much that it isn't worth it so no one bothers doing it for the most part.  The game has basically become roam to find rorqs to tackle to get them to drop caps so you can kill fighters, or bash a structure for a fight which is just braindead as fuck and makes me want to quit the game every time I have to be in a bashing fleet as fucking logi.  At least with POSes I got to rep people and shit cause they shot back by default. v0v
---
Yes, they can. Its stupid expensive and slow, but they can. A stealth bomber can as well but it just takes ages and they only clear the battleships (the shit you see when rolling your C5 static in Moscow prime time is.....unique)
---
In the OPs case, it was a FoF raven. They work better in black holes (and as barghests) but they can.
---
Some people don't hop on comms sometimes, it happens.
---
Very very gay
---
Not really, it makes it impossible for invasions if there is a limit. 
---
Think I'm wrong? **Be goons, max out every system with citadels so no one can invade you ever again.**
---
The real problem is that there is too many advantages for defenders. 2 timers, invul on undock, defences that can shoot back, asset safety, VERY CHEAP.
---
There should be a RAM you deploy that will auto destroy a citadel that the defenders must attack. Like trebuchet or cannons in the medieval age. So an attacker could just deploy THAT instead of wasting a 100 dudes time three times.

Generally people take out Vexor Navy Issues or some other ships and warp to a &lt;Pirate Faction&gt; Forsaken Hub, orbit at 30km, and launch drones... then the drones take care of targeting and attacking people. All you have to do is AFK. From the pirate bounties (money you get from killing them), the amount going to your wallet is processed every 20 minutes on the server end. So if you load your balance it will show up in "ticks."
---
Carrier ratting (btw ratting is what everyone calls killing pirate npcs for money) is quite a bit faster and more profitable than using a cruiser or battleship to rat since you have fighter drones that do a lot more damage, but it's more involved. You end up being able to do sites in 5-6 minutes and make well over 100m per hour, versus the 45-60m per hour you make in a cruiser.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I'm still relatively new but hey, helping a newbro out is fun. :)

Heavy Assault Missile launchers are nice....but their range is just....ungh.
---
No matter how you slice and dice it and what excuses and theories you come up with, the bottom line is that currently 90% of the CSM represents around 30% of the playerbase, though to be fair, about 3 of them are actively looking at Eve as a whole and actually trying to promote changes that will benefit game as a whole and more longterm instead of their individualized agendas. There is exactly 1 CSM that doesn't. And it needs to change. 
---
Other then the 3 mentioned and the 1 from HS the rest are pretty utter shit with nothing but personalized agendas.
---
Regardless of the change mechanics such as limiting number of CSMs per region, or coalition or whatever else.
---
In addition, there need to be more **in game** information sources as well as ways to vote because vast majority of players do not go out to external sources.
---
Availability of ingame voting mechanics as well as any of the limiting mechanics will greatly offset this. 
---
O and please do go ask on official forums as well as other places. Reddit is heavily skewed and is just a single source of opinions. Feel free to research and confirm, don't take my word for it.

HAMs are fun, but I'm talking about ye Olde Light Missile using Assault Missile Launchers.

Posted 2 years ago. :(
---
&gt; I quit the game pretty much because of this total lack of contact.
---
:((
---
Sorry dude. I've quit other games for similar reasons.
---
then enlighten us, what exactly were you doing? The drops from rats in the last event were abysmal, and the only other thing to do besides the boxes was the points grind to get the handful of skins awarded for grinding the events over and over and that only worked if the missions didn't bug and give you a month long wait to unlock another mission
---
Fun for us then 😀
---
Relics of a bygone era. I wonder if the controller passed away and the bot has just been botting away for the last few years... Impervious to the world around it.
---
Except in Delve
---
Or you could create a mechanic where there is a limited number (based on planets or moons perhaps) and then an attacking force has to destroy one first. I don't see the problem with that. That would make establishing a beachhead big-battle worthy.
---
Yep, that was my bad, new accounts and existing accounts can grab it too, which is cool :)
---
No, anom spawn locations are limited. If you cover all of them you can even get a citadel right on top of fresh WH spawns.
---
tfw i can literally double my net worth by shitposting
---
It should just unanchor itself. Leave asset safety alone. Then clearing low power cits is profitable.
---
Could you tell us about it?
---
Have you heard of moon mining? For 0 isk and 0 commitment, you can trundle out to BWF and join Horde and mine our moons for dank isk.

Well, thank you for the work you do. It's incredible to see people so dedicated to saving lives.

Citadels great idea badly implemented and thought out.  Far too cheap easy to build.  Should be 10x the cost,  and there should be a limit of how many can be placed in a system,  to cause conflict.  This is worse than POS spamming which everyone hated.  We've gone back 10 years... well done
---
Nullsec keepstar assaults as far as I'm aware have relied on staging cits anchored on grid. What I'm saying is that allowing defenders to max out the cap would block this strategy without offering any kind of counter play. 
---
But you seem like you want to be reductive and pithy, so that nuance might escape you.
---
But Damaviks with them would be a lot more interesting. That's a Kikimora problem, not a rig problem.
---
You can play the game for free and you can do a ton of activities. Also EVE is not as remotely as competitive as people claim it to be. Like all other MMOs you playing mostly by yourself and none will bother you. You always lose a ship, but if you fly cheap ships that will never be an issue because you can replace them easily. Just do not join a corp that is in war with a big PVP corp cause will ruin your fun. But yeah EVE documentation is poor and the game is badly designed in many areas which make it unfriendly to new players but overall it a great fun to play. 
---
So you biggest issue is not older players with a ton of money, its the fact that EVE is unnecessarily confusing for beginners and even experienced players.  If you can get past that and accept EVE with its flaws you will do fine.
---
Yea I'm just waiting for more fighting between everyone so I can get better pvp footage ;)

&gt;But you seem like you want to be reductive and pithy, so that nuance might escape you.

Also go fuck yourself.
---
Well you're a dino brain so of course you don't see the problem with that. You're basically describing the old system with POS. Which had a ton of problems with it.
---
No, the freedom of deployment is a good thing, but we need enhance attacker advantages. Right now its a defender only advantage. Limiting the structures to moons again would be an additional defender advantage. Which is the wrong direction and will make the game even worse.
---
I dunno, tell me the system name and the times of your activity window and I'll do further research to determine if it's safe.

---
Alliance ops for us means alliance loot goes to alliance for srp fund, that’s pretty standard procedure everywhere. 
---
For little fun roams, no one cares.  But like you said, if someone loses something helping the fleet, the decent thing is to get him sorted from the loot if possible first.
---
Well, in that case, where's the full-resolution download.
---
Yeah for the alliance ops that makes sense, even though I always see sneaky little mfs looting and salvaging while everyone is fighting lol.
---
CODE f-ers and others will sometimes suicide gank, sometimes even at a financial loss, sometimes just for the helluva it, even in the highest of high-sec/
---
Standings FFA in Horde as well.
---
I don't even see how that relates to what I said, but it wouldn't be a part in /r/eve if nobody called anybody stupid.
---
This is because CCP lack imagination and foresight when it comes to implementing gameplay.
---
Ofcourse you don't.
---
I see, seems like that’s pretty standard for most.
---
But I would imagine it’s pretty difficult to have a chance at looting since Horde is pretty big and I would imagine there’s quite a few people/ninjas in standing haha
---
They work but aren’t necessary. You can do all anoms and relic/data sites with an active snake once you understand the spawns and such of each site. Not having to refit in site is probably a net benefit for lower so/new players but I wouldn’t say that passive snakes suck.
---
So when can we use Mobile Siphons for citadel fuel now that they can no longer drain moon goo?
---
To this date I'm mad about it, fuck.
---
this is why infantry assault is needed-send in commando with blasting charges
---
Our alliance rule is for the scout but strongly suggested it goes to SRP which it normally goes to. That's wormholes though
---
If a module is worth more than 30m or so, it goes to the corp to fleet srp for anyone who lost a ship. Any left over funds get split among the fleet members who made the kill.
---
Modules less than the limit are a ffa.

The FC fine tunes the policy.

Olmeca cant even post his pve fit without being harassed by a goon mod

Makes sense, I normally offer splits to whoever was involved in the kills but most people decline them, but in your case as you said in a smaller Corp it would be best to be used as srp

New structures should be taxed more depending on how many there are already in the system? So first few are free, the rest are more and more expensive?

Limits do not have to be hard set and can be adjusted every X months based on accumulated data. Also they do not have to be based just on total number, they can have various sub limits and some reserve space within the totals.

Will fixing all future bot/rmt issues come down to nerfing/changing game mechanics at the expense of the playerbase? Or will CCP take a proper approach to combating these things and assign the appropriate  resources and development?

well forts are the stations, and those are still not that cheap, at least with fittings. yes you can spam them, but you gotta have the cash for them. and structures are limited by PI and their rigs, both of it is pretty scarce
---
Miners who run their mouths in local or the mining channel get special attention just for the sake of proving a point.  More often than not a miner will be left alone of they tank up a proc or skiff.

Might as well come pre fit with the guns. Just takes the fun out of fitting. I think one dread is fine. Unless you make a super dread like a super carrier or some craziness.
---
I think wingspan's point was that the permaban of Brisc was because CCP wanted to prove a point that they care about corruption on the CSM as so gave him a harsher ban than Pando and Shines.
---
Not a lot of ships go over 6km/s.
---
Half of our fleets are Indy alts to scoop loot
---
you have to ask yourself - if goons aren't sitting in delve mining, ratting, and building... what are they doing?
---
totally not doing a campaign somewhere, that's for sure.
---
&gt;Now my question is, is this the same case with other corps?
---
I tend to find that it’s more often left up to the FC to decide. 
---
I know personally I’ve tried a number of different loot split methods depending on what’s going on.
---
For small roams with low-loot, I don’t even bother unless it’s like nanotechnology or drones someone needs. If we happen on an extremely juicy kill and the fleet is fairly small, I’ll usually see if anyone wants to buy the items there, and then sell the rest in Jita so I can split it up for the fleet. 
---
For large fleets that I can’t bother to track loot, it’s a first come first serve only once the fighting is done. 
---
If it’s a structure bash, again depends on the number of people involved. I don’t like the hassle of tracking who was on how many fleets so if it’s not just a couple of dudes it goes to the SRP fund. If there’s no SRP fund I typically will stash the isk away for something fun or gimmicky where I can hand out ships. Once caught a Rorqual with some officer mods fit (before they became tank monsters) and used the isk to buy some ridiculously fast Hyperspatial Angel Cartel ships that we took out later. 
---
And basically same thing for structure bashes. If it’s an alliance or Corp op I’ll just send the materials to the alliance/Corp to do SRP or whatever.
---
If they can afford the upkeep then what's the problem? Why are people trying to make such complicated suggestions when raising upkeep costs would be the simplest and most practical solution.
---
I’ve done that a few times for the reactions, it’s hilarious..
---
I love how all the valid questions just get downvoted by all then fan bois on this sub.
---
To elaborate, your 5 drones are perfectly capable of defending you from the frigate NPC spawns that you will see in 0.5.
---
You are however not safe from *players*.
---
Miners have this peculiar tenancy to pump ridiculous amounts of isk into these paper thin hulls with the intention of wringing just a little bit more ore per cycle.  Faction mods, expensive drones, and very little if any tank.
---
This attracts predators.  The most infamous of which are the corps that fly under the CODE. alliance, but there are other, lesser gank corps as well.
---
An untanked Mack will fall to a single gank catalyst in 5-10 seconds depending on pilot skills and fit.  This is less than the Concord response time for a 0.5 system.  Two Catalysts will crush any tank the Mackinaw can put up.
---
If you insist on belt mining, you will considerably reduce your potential for victimhood by flying the tankier Procurer barge.  You will of course sacrifice ore yield.
---
A lot of that could be everyone freaking out about the ratting changes so they self destructed their super
---
Lmao, I can only imagine. Is this in standing fleet or general roams too? I assume there’s a few TCUs spread across all gate camps
---
CCP uses [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote). That should allow every group of size to have representation, and is much better at representing smaller groups than the two party system that the US uses.
---
**The reason why the CSM is so skewed is that so few people actually bother to vote.** Full stop. If you remember your Eve history, the CSM used to be dominated by highsec because nullsec didn't consider it important. Then the jump bridge changes hit limiting jump bridges to only 1 per system. Suddenly Nullsec realised the importance of the CSM and ever since there has always been some representation of nullsec at the CSM.
---
Highsec has a higher population count than nullsec. Nullsec is the minority group in terms of numbers. Yet nullsec is over represented. So this isn't a case of a majority drowning out a minority.
---
Nothing affects democracy like apathy. Fix the CSM apathy that exists in highsec and it will have more representation.
---
I was a single man at the time, no food in the house to worry about.
---
Yeah I had a run in with code a few months back they ganked me before I even knew what happened lol. Thanks for the info though.
---
How about standing fleets, I assume that goes to SRP too?
---
No need to delete. Increasing upkeep costs is the easiest and simplest solution.
---
u/notkana
---
Reason is simple. Because you are a renter. The money you pay for that system goes directly into the wallet of Goon's enemy. As passive moon mining is a thing of the past, your very existence is lucrative to your landlord, and one of their few remaining ways to make money. 
---
Basically, killing you, costing you money or preventing you from making money prevents you from paying rent, so your land lord suffers.
---
I can't speak for the other alliances involved, but I can speak for mine. I fucking hate botting. When I started cloaky camping in The Spire about a month ago I had a spreadsheet of 50ish VNI/Gila characters and the planet/moon POS they would warp to including the local timer they had before warping again. Killed a few VNI's that way. If I can disrupt that shit, even for just a little while, I'm game. I'm sure your compatriots will all scurry off to other hideyholes and start over again, but you'll have to deal with the logistics and the whole resetting thing.
---
On top of that, I hate the way this game has polarized into two groups. I loathe the fact that there are several great regions in the game being rented when small alliances could live there and actually encourage PvP. If renting were abolished tomorrow by CCP, I'd be legit over the moon about it. I've run small alliances now for a very long time and it's very, very frustrating to know that botters are being placed higher in priority because of the income they generate to those who protect them than the potential for a smaller alliance to take space, grow, and PvP. This is the #1 reason I moved to wormholes.  
---
People bitch about how there's only two blocs anymore and how the game is stagnated while happily Rorqual mining or Super ratting and then jumping to a cyno when one of their renters gets tackled. It's fucking idiotic beyond belief, but that's human nature for you I guess. While I'm not naive enough to think this won't just turn into rental space for someone else, at least I can know I helped put a dent into of the most egregious offenders of botting in the game.
---
I second the 7th

Oh yeah I’ll pm the info to you right away!

---
Music is meh. Good footage tho.
---
Yes you could. Citadels can be solo'd if nobody comes to shoot you, poses could be solo'd if nobody fit any guns. You won't be soloing a citadel that's defended, so the cases where you get a solo cit kill are an irrelevant minority. In the majority of cases, you're bashing unfuelled structures 2 times and fuelled 3 times against defenders with the day of the week and rough timeslot chosen by defenders. You set all cits to the same time, even if everything is rf'd in a day (and almost nobody actually *enjoys* bashing cits) anyone who wants to kick you out is going to miss timers if you've spammed these structures you can buy for 600m. Old structures also gave you loot in all space, while with citadels even after you draw on the raging autism of your line members everything just goes to asset safety outside of wormholes. With week-long timers not being all that uncommon, it can take months to win a single system assuming the regular bashing doesn't kill the morale of your group, as even large alliances will have to do a few structures at a time because mechanics.
---
TL;DR barely any situations let you solo these new ones and being able to solo them at all comes at the cost of loot going to owner's asset safety rather than dropping unless it's a wormhole. Structure mechanics mean if you spam these low-value shitfests it can take months of bashing and morale drain to grind through a single defended system, and even smaller-scale evictions can easily take a week and usually longer. CCP are retarded and citadel limits are needed.
---
We can barely get real people to light a cyno in the right fleet, let alone bots.
---
probably the same way most people that play eve bathe (hint: they don't)
---
They still camping that pipe and no one doing anything about it? 😄
---
I haven't played plex pvp for a while, but when I did I caught a vcouple frags with a scram kiting velator, which I think works better than this (velator isn't super fast tbh). 
---
I went nice and simple t2 scram, some ab, mag stab, dc, rails, and acolyte iirc. 
---
I ate cheap frentix and I don't think I needed any implants, maybe a cheap fitting implant but I doubt it. Unlinked because, well,  be a fucking human being lmao.
---
In theory? Sure. On the other hand there are only so many C5 black hole WHs, and the sties do run out. Besides, they are incredibly easy to kill if you tackle one and without local it is significantly easier to catch them. Even if they are always d-scaning, there is still the chance you de-cloak during the interval they d-scan is refreshing, and they have no way of knowing if you've left or not without manual intervention. Even if they leave the moment a new sig appears, there is still a decent interval between a player jumping through a fresh WH and the WH appearing as a sig. Besides, an alpha can also bot C3 sites in a rattle, and probably make more ISK/hr doing so untill the sties run out. This is also assuming the botters don't just go to NS where sites re-spawn infernally and you have perfect intel with local. Can you bot a WH? Yes. Is it significantly easier and more salable in NS? Also yes.
---
or
---
1. remove TCUs and iHubs, make them large rigs for citadels
---
2. add service slots for the iHub upgrades, must be fueled
---
3. cost for holding systems should increase weekly if system is not used/adms low

---
&gt;Citadels great idea badly implemented and thought out. 
---
Perhaps
---
&gt; Far too cheap easy to build. Should be 10x the cost 
---
Cost isn't really the problem. Remember "we don't expect to see more then 3-4 titans because they are so expensive"
---
&gt; and there should be a limit of how many can be placed in a system, to cause conflict. 
---
Na, there are far better and simpler solutions.
---
&gt; to cause conflict. 
---
Removing asset safety in 0.0 might do that, but then that would just move everyone into lowsec
---
Back in my Brave days, I was sitting cloaked on a gate in a bomber, waiting for a reported red fleet to jump through. 
---
Unfortunately, a TEST fleet (allies at the time) jumped in instead. 
---
Didn't get a kill as I was a single little newbie bomber, but sure spooked them.
---
This is why the process for voting needs to be as convenient as possible. Having it be something out of game, on a separate page, where you have to look for it, and research who's running, greatly favors nullsec alliances since they can aggressively lobby for votes through their alliance infrastructure and social circles.
---
The word you're looking for is a sovereignty blockade unit, aka SBU.

You don't need Sov to drop cits?

Being able to use it as a blockade runner and covert bridge around with covert cynos is really nice. Having ceptors trained on them for moving from one side of the galaxy to the other is very useful. You can do whatever race of frigate you want in this plan however the Caldari Interceptors are the worst. Gallente Industrial allows you to do Nereus cynos which are hella tanky against the solo cyno gankers.
---
If you want to have the alt just sit in one station forever then cyno 4 and frigate 1 is fine. Just move a JF with 100 cynos, 100 frigates and a stack of liquid ozone.
---
&gt; everyone freaking out about the ratting changes so they self destructed their super
---
Well that's a way to reduce capital ship proliferation that I hadn't considered before.
---
That kinda depends on the size and activity. If it’s just me and like 4 dudes then it’s easy to split, but if it’s 20-30 with people dropping in and out all the time then yeah it’ll probably go to SRP or just be FFA if it’s small enough not to care much. 
---
That being said, there have been some times where I’ll rageping for a rapid form, and if I see someone looting (especially blue wrecks) you’ve basically got until I finish locking you to explain yourself. However that’s a rare case and very circumstantial.
---
Just worried, man. I ve never met someone so far who worked 7D/week without suffering heavily cause of it, latest mid-term.
---
If the damavik had some locus coordinators it'd be less suck.
---
Or some base stats.
---
Or if it was cheaper.
---
God the damavik sucks.
---
that also includes all the insurance fraud that's being done because of the absurdly low mineral prices in Delve.
---
Small market, shipping fees, effort
---
As a Detorid resident this graph triggers me. Reeeee
---
Generally ffa but two exceptions:
---
1. If ships are provided we have the option to claim loot. We only typically do this to buy more ships or reimburse.
---
2. If we get a really big kill with a reasonably small group of guys, we'll keep the loot and pay dudes out market price split evenly.
---
It's all about being fair and making sure we can continue to provide content. 90% of the time idgaf about loot, even if it's blingy.
---
Maybe they should tie sov attack to wardec mecánica where attacker get fast citadel deployment in enemy space. This can provide many other benefits.
---
Screen shot? Vid dont load on mobile
---
holy shit
---
Is that supposed to be a haiku?
---
I've seen bots using citadels, but yes majority uses a small pos in the center of a system
---
SBU's were a structure you dropped to initiate a fight over sov in the old system. It's the same basic principle.
---
True, bring back SBUs but for cits?!??!1
---
That would actually be funny if the ownship switched. Asset safety wound't trigger, and now you hold all their shit hostage. xD
---
They happened because POS mechanics weren't Citadel mechanics.  
---
Also, the attacker could prevent the defender from dropping replacements by putting up their own POS.  
---
Finally, you could only realistically store a limited amount of ships in a POS and no cloning, so hanging on to a POS that was now "behind enemy lines" wasn't as big an advantage.
---
Or don't be a poor and give no fucks about who gets the scraps.
---
Yes - what system?
---
Your drones mean nothing against someone that has decided to gank you. For that matter, your tank means nothing as well. If they want you dead, you're gonna die.

This isn’t funny — You need to WARN people before you do that!
---
Fuel blocks, do they have a future? Are they currently used for anything except POS fuel? Has there been any talk of a use for them when POS are gone?

Bet they keep saying not to panic ... until the INIT bosses have all their stuff evac’d.  😂
---
Sweet, spam a crapload of astras in a hostile system, suck up all their fuel, and force all their structures into low-power.
---
GAMERS SIT DOWN
---
So I'm not sure this idea has been posted yet, but what about making maximum timer length of a structure in a system inversely proportional to the number of structures in that system, regardless of who owns them?
---
Thank you kind sir :) also looks like I am going to be able to grab this pack tomorrow :D

Vedmaks becoming super ONIs...

With 3 toons that have IPC IV and CCU IV you can build nanite repair paste from dirt. It's a lot easier to haul out than a P4 product. Good for not quite 1bil/mo if you have decent extraction planets (not in hisec).
---
It is. I posted several times this idea and more and more people are behind it.
---
Project Nova Status
---
won't change much, they just need to use citadels instead and write something to dock/undock
---
In current citadel state and eve state you might have a point. But if citadels cost get to 5-10 times what it is today and only 2 timers instead of 3 with fatigue for ansiblex gates then the whole scenario is different
---
Normally in my corp x-up whoever loots it first keeps it
---
I know, my name for the ship is beautiful
---
What was the exact fit you did?
---
Just remember that my omen is shield fit when you shoot me in the face with those leshaks next time you MONSTER
---
While I'd be all for that for Citadel bashing purposes. A max DPS fit Leshak can put out around 2500 dps.
---
With this attitude, maybe just uninstall.
---
&gt;Can you simply not take sovereignity untill every structure has been blown up?
---
You can take Sov.  The problem is you're leaving a very effective base for the other side to counter-attack.
---
POSes could realistically only hold a limited number of ships and there was no cloning to them.  So leaving some POSes up while you attacked further into their space wasn't that big a deal.
---
Alphas can’t use cynos

I dunno at 11:08 there were 0 players, seems pretty dead to me

First we pay for ships lost, then hunter gets dibs on the rest, but usually donates to Corp SRP or only cherry picks the shinies. If there is no hunter, then it’s FFA. Exception for this is preplanned corp ops, then it’s all SRP except cheap stuff which is FFA.

---
Remember my time way back in WWB, when you guys came to help us out if goons were being mean (or well, they tried to, I guess).
---
It's all about comparative advantage, not the absolute numbers
---
Wingspan do 50% to the content finder, 25% to srp and 25% to the rest of the fleet.
---
Do the cerebral accelerators have an expiration date, I couldn't find one except the character using them must be less than 35 days old?
---
If not I forsee some folks stockpiling these off the 'free' deal at which point they contract them out to day old injected dread/titan alts. Does 20% gun damage or 20% missile damage only apply to sub-cap weapons?
---
It looks absolutely amazing. Would buy one if they were up for sale.
---
I'm so sad that the PVP gate is often closed during USTZ... Wish more nerds ran abyssal or CCP would lower the threshold for pvp in the abyss
---
What if all structures in a system got weaker, and reinforcement times got shorter, as more structures come fully online in a system?
---
Once you're over a certain number, you lose a reinforcement timer on newly-erected structures, and after a second number, there's no timers at all?
---
This gives people an incentive to pop structures older than them (makes their own structure stronger) *and* makes it easier to kill structures when there's a lot polluting your space.
---
I mean I'm of the opinion that Attack is preferable to Defense just because it would pressure the market. Would it really be that bad if citidels actually did increase in price? Even by twice what you fear? Maybe people would be more considerate with them. You know, aka make them more valuable. 
---
One of the things EvE Insider would always was point out (before he quit) is that EVERYTHING is way too cheap. Mostly because the number of conflicts (and thus fun) has been vastly reduced.
---
I think you're onto something there, but here's an idea, why not making a new structure with attacker advantages that would give up some of the defense oriented things?
---
think no reinforcement timers, no tether, but having it in system would slowly drain the shields of all citadels owned by a target alliance? so you'd drop one in a system and hold it for a day, but if you can keep it there long enough it'll save you a reinforcement timer on \*all\* of their citadels. would help with citadel spam cleanup too.  
---
you could do other types of attacking structures too, I can imagine a bunch right off  
---
\- put local in delayed mode
---
\- turn off citadel services  
---
\- delayed gate activation
---
\- system wide warp slow-down
---
\- apply wormhole style effects to the whole system i.e. armor buff, shield debuff, sig radius changes, etc.
---
\- reduce ratting ticks  
---
you can probably even re-use a bunch of the code from incursions to do it. could also use the new abyssal area effect stuff tied to deployable structures, i.e. drone killing towers, etc
---
What empire space gives the most valuable salvage? I have a corpmate that swears up and down that Gallente space has the most valuable salvage based on its rats. Is this true assuming sites done are same security lowsec space, just different pirate faction? Or each is faction more useful for building certain things, there by worth more at market?
---
Can he hire a new CEO that actually cares about gameplay and then fire himself?

Bonus points if he goes the extra mile and exiles himself somewhere remote to forever contemplate how he had a monopoly on the only great player driven sandbox space MMO and decided to do almost nothing with it and slowly watch it die while all the talented artists struggle to make the corpse as beautiful as possible.
---
delete Stargates
---
replace with abyssal wormholes or something 
---
delete local 
---
Eve is fixed
---
You spelt obligatory need a lowsec to stain gate wrong.
---
Honestly this isn't the worst idea I've seen on this subreddit. Having large fleets of trig/sansha fighting across sections of the south (Delve 🤔) around gates/belts and attacking upwell structures making it much higher risk could be interesting.

Slingshots?
---
Still waiting on my SoE capital which insta-scans every sig in system
---
So when you are holding range and someone either wants to close on you or escape your scram they can fly towards you, which will make your ship turn, then away from you, but you're flying away now right? So by the time your ship turns back around and catches up perhaps they have pulled range and they win (or they just leave).

Stainguy wants a lowsec gate , i want local deleted for Nullsec
---
https://i.imgur.com/FOwZ77O.mp4
---
Burn it all down. 
---
No, really, I mean it. Let a war between the drifters, drones and triglavians wipe out all sov and structures in nullsec and lowsec for like a month, forcing everyone to become hisec refugees before it becomes safe enough to venture back out and start to reclaim sov from the NPCs.
---
And then, just as civilization starts to recover, unplug the servers for good. No notice, just fuck you and thanks for all the fish.
---
How about we delete Stain and put a gate to jita local.
---
Oh hey the Triglavians has decided Fountain is the perfect landing spot for their invasion. Due to the mechanics whoever lives there cannot hold that space anymore, and it is out of their control. Why was no one else affected. Fun and engaging gameplay.
---
por que no los dos
---
Imagine whelping a Monitor to a fun NPSI roam.
---
Max tank, and rig it for yield
---
&gt; my thumbs are furries
---
Better hope it's just a phase.
---
WALL-E?
---
You got any more of those Hero stories?
---
MTUs you mean? Nah. I’ve never seen them used in standings, they are too slow I guess?
---
But in ops they are completely forbidden, FCs will aggro them at sight. Same with out of fleet haulers simetimes.
---
Two things:
---
1) Instead of delaying local, what if the Triglavians instead 'jam' local and translate it all into their trialphabet?
---
2) CCP said Wormholes would be uninhabitable and look how that turned out. But it would be a great way to shake the game up, make players learn about the new mechanics and how to adapt to live.
---
Ideas as to how to make it different enough but still challenging:
---
* Have Sansha/Trig rats attack any Upwell Structures
---
* Make the rats slightly less smart that drifters/sleepers but form up in greater numbers (incursion style) so they balance in difficulty
---
* Trigalphabet local
---
* Have rats compete for asteroid belts/anoms
---
* Have rats target those with lower standings with them first and ignore those with higher standings. That way you can either try to be impartial and hope that they target everyone else first or favour one side and hope that the rats warping in to your Rorq are friendly.
---
* Have rats place cyno-jammers semi-randomly (in a logical way though - like players would if they have capitals in system or wanted to stop their opponent bringing any in) to stop the other side's rats from jumping in capitals but it also stops players doing the same
---
* Have rat jump freighters and freighters that call for help. If you gank them and can get back to High Sec despite having no structures anywhere nearby to easily re-ship you get a massive payout (lots of faction modules, ships etc) but it's still high risk as you could get every rat in the region come to stop you (waves could represent them coming from 1 jump out, 2 jumps etc so could have random sized squads or even caps jumping in).
---
* Make the rats scale alongside the player threat. As capsuleers get the upper hand in the three-way tussle, the rats will put in more resources to combat it and bring in more and more troops. Same with if one of the two rat factions (rat-cions?) started gaining more strategic advantage.
---
Basically I'm imagining a 3-way incursion with FW mechanics and weird symbols in local.
---
more detailed pls///
---
Well, if it become possible, and you then manage to sell those without stupidly high transport fees (unlike the current joke eve store), you'll get lots of clients.
---
Citadels use fuel blocks
---
More details: go mine a moon in null
---
Haven't seen that asked anywhere... What printer are you using for those? I do suppose it's a professional one, thus something nobody here would go for, but i'm still interested in hearing about it.
---
So, serious question for you.  
---
You have more CTAs than an average alliance. You’re running around doing entosis timers. You’re harassed and threatened for rent payments. The people your isk is going to don’t show up half the time, abuse you when they do, and haven’t done anything to stop the harassment you’ve been facing for years now. 
---
With all that, why the fuck do you *pay* for this privilege? I could understand if renting meant uninterrupted isk making with no CTAs, protection in place, actually getting something back for your isk.  That’s certainly not what you’re getting now. Why not become your own alliance for the same or less work and be much better off financially? As you can see by what we’re doing NC would be powerless to stop you. 
---
Anyway to answer, because your isk goes to NC.
---
Eve online is a mistake
---
That'll do
---
Loading all that junk while warping, this is why i get FPS drops when playing on my laptop which has a HDD.
---
you can't extract below 5m... so there's that...
---
I'm sure Init could move and take space elsewhere. Oh wait...  
---
But seriously I can think of a few regions notorious for botting that could be prime locations. But really null needs a good shake up. Randomize it and let the chips fall where they may. Having groups displaced and shrinking viable space is a great catalyst for conflict.
---
what lore reason would there be for any of it to happen in delve?
---
I mean provi, wormholes, drone regions.. any of those areas are obvious, so what's the reasoning for delve other than grrr goons?
---
Or even like an Air-Fix style build and paint yourself kit.
---
Let's face it, the Venn diagram of Eve players and people who have bought something from Games Workshop must look very close to just one circle
---
Meh
---
If player based groups refuse to finally start a large enough conflicts to burn away some resources, maybe it would be for the best to have NPCs instigate.
---
I remember a blue in a prop was scavenging during a strat op, FC got triggered and made everyone blow him up, then got somebody to web his pod lmao
---
"We have no plans for a low sec gate to Stain nor naming it after anyone on CSM past or present"
---
Does one need a reason other than Grrr Goons? 😂
---
That’s a clever and fair way to do it, I like that.. isn’t wingspan a wormhole Corp btw think I remember watching a YouTube vid of some WH battle..
---
Not sure that is a good idea. If they put these into the game they would have to nerf Kiki, Drekavac and Leshak. Possibly the inc VedHAC and Trig AF. Its better to buff the Demavik rather then have rigs like this. Though I wouldn't mind some sort of Disintegrator rigs, like ones that reduce cap use or PG. 
---
If we had rigs that reduce PG on them then you might have enough fitting freedom on Demavik to make it work well for something as well as the Vedmak. Vedmaks are a bit underwhelming too considering their price tag and crappy resist profile.
---
For fuck sake /u/CCP_Falcon 
---
LET ME GIVE YOU MONEY FOR THESE.

I WANT TO GIVE YOU HARD CURRENCY FOR THESE MODELS. 
---
WHY WON'T YOU TAKE MY MONEY
---
&gt; will CCP ever sell 3d Ship models in EVE shop?
---
They used to a long time ago. Would be nice to see again.
---
So the answer to that depends on who you ask. 
---
We operate in J space, but because we don't live in it, a lot of the wormhole corps who live there don't consider Wingspan one.
---
* Do you feel your recent AMA with the community was a success considering the criticisms that it felt major concerns had been ignored or edited out due to them being inconvenience or hard to answer?
---
* Have you truly learnt from the mistakes of Incarna or have you just got better at PR?
---
* Considering you have been CEO for a very long time, do you consider it a failing on your ability to lead CCP that the CSM is still asking for a roadmap of where CCP and EVE are going but you are still unable to deliver?
---
The timers need to be changed: 
---
Defender should be able to choose the extract timezone OR day of the week of the final timer. If they choose timezone the final timer could be any day of the week, if they choose day the timer could be anytime in that day. This provides choice but also opens up attacks to weekends if the defender chooses timezone. They still have the three timers so its not like they can't plan around the possibilities.
---
Serious note, I hope Nova turns out well. Their past projects were decently executed, imo, just were grasping at straws for potential demographics. I wish they could hire the Angels Fall First team to help develop it, those guys have a fun as hell game.

---
I was thinking it really looks like a triglavian heavy fighter sized sentry drone.
---
Which is basically the same thing if that gigantic ship can use fighter sentries.
---
Can't do anything about it. For every structure destroyed. 5 new ones are deployed. Only bass die there anyway.
---
Quality of life improvement: big button to add/remove citadels from overview quickly. You can right click to remove them quickly, but then you either have to find one in space or go into overview settings to add them back. There are just too damn many in most systems where stuff happens.
---
Ask this. Please. There are so many abandoned ideas floating around, hideously broken, that CCP just ignore because "WE'RE DOING ABYSSALS NOW". 
---
They have corporate ADHD. Drifters amounted to sweet fuck all. NPC Sotiyos are farmed by 3 Supers sitting at range, with no changes or new Sotiyos in sight. Events change in premise for no apparent reason beyond "We want to change things", often to the detriment of the actual event.
---
TLDR: When will CCP actually go back and fix the broken stuff. Not new stuff. Maintaining the things that we already have in game.
---
Also ask him to buff Harbingers more kty
---
Well the lore would be the Trigs wanting people to assimilate to them. They pretty much made it clear for the everyone to join them or suffer. The empires view the capsuleers as a necessary evil. As for the pirates I am not sure. Sansha wants to enslave any person so he isn't really targeting capsuleers. Why not make the main focus of the Triglavians the capsuleers.
---
I meant the Fountain war kicked off because of the Moon changes. This isn't a whole lot different.
---
Awesome stuff.  
---
Gut feeling, OP is pitching this to CCP and is getting /r/Eve to endorse him.  
---
Its working.  CCP, hire this person or at least give him/her a license.
---
easy fix: introduce a new index.
---
The more structure of similar type in a system, greater the fuel requirment are to keep them online.
---
Flair checks out.
---
I feel like it's a lot more. I have never ever gone into a system and have one of my safes be inside an anomaly. And I usually make them by warping to one.
---
Ask them why they got rid of the lore team.
---

This is the inside view of the thing. Pretty sure it's a standalone structure. Perhaps designed to go on the mounting point of the structure under construction in the T5 Sites. What we thinkg may be a weapons platform may be a platform for this.
---
.. no, not really. Have you seen the MERs? Goons and the like have actual Titan fleets. You could multiply the cost of structures by 20x, and Goons would still be anchoring them like crazy.
---
You'd only be hurting everyone else. My group couldn't afford structures that cost that much, especially if it became harder to actually defend them. We'd be homeless, and we'd probably end up joining Goons.
---
Only way to find out is to start making bookmarks I guess.
---
lol so send them to Jita to set up walls of mobile depots with recruitment adverts; Delve is hardly the most heavily trafficked place in the game. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I actually like the idea of having their war break out into normal space similarly to sansha incursions.. but why give goons all the content?
---
Spotted the /u/StainGuy alt
---
Oh for sure. Hit Jita for all that shit is worth in my opinion. From a lore perspective that could pose a bit of a problem seeing as that is empire space so one would assume that the empires would respond and then congrats it's faction warfare
---
You'd lower the spam, but hurt smaller groups that live in medium structures. Why should smaller groups have to suffer because large ones abuse a game mechanic?
---
Large alliances would handle this just fine. Smaller groups would be SOL. There's a reason not everyone lives in WH space.
---
Any ideas for preventing new player retention? If so, can you share any? Just saying, FW could be potential entry for pvp for new players.. ;)
---
A complete timezone dead.
---
Fucking hell RIP EVE
---
Because POSes aren't a thing anymore.
---
If you make it impossible for every corp to have their own structures, nullsec is going to be empty and corps like Goons and TEST will see double, if not triple the membership they currently have.
---
It looks to me like its a sort of station
---
As long as the drawback is an Optimal Range penalty.
---
Q. its estimate that CCP yields over $100million USD a year in revenue, Rockstar Games spent approx $245million on creating GTA V ...given you have recently accepted $200-400million via investment from an acquisition, can you elaborate why with a AAA budget the game continues to lay dormant with no future features from mid-to-end game players and a consistent history of unfinished features. Where is that money going to EVE or other projects?
---
In 2 0 1 9 ? Naglfar, Apostle and Vindicator.
---
If you want to role play the shit out of this, go for 3 remote-repping triglavian ships. 3 Vedmak's or Kikimora's would be a lot of fun.
---
If your friend is hell-bent on a naga, then 1 naga and 2 other shield-based ships. Bring shield rep drones, and avoid most engagements. I don't know enough about the sites to form a team with 1 naga in it.
---
You had me until #4
---
If you just want isk then take three Nestor’s and do C5 sites. But y’all should do some PVP, sites will get old
---
Then they probably wouldn't let their FC get tackled in the first place.
---
When its gonna be fun again ? and why to be have to have tool tips for tool tips can we switch them off no
---
Aren't they a component of most (all?) reaction formulas? Or are those a different kind of fuel block?
---
I love this. Why not get the Drifters in on this too, and just make it as much of an absolute clusterfuck as possible out there in Null? Don't completely annihilate the current Null regimes, just present them with comparably powerful AI factions to disrupt the status quo. Redefine some borders, Y'know?
---
In New Eden, safety exists only under the umbrella of an empire. Unlike the Great Empires in Hi-Sec, the empires forged out in Null can fall.
---
Except they mostly aren't falling. Let's do something about that, shall we?
---
Praise our bellowed Lord Sansha Kuvakei!
---
what ctas. there are those who volunteer to fight to defend .
---
in the corp i am a memeber of there are no ctas. watched a vid that was on twitch imperium news or something and had to laugh at all the things they sad about that was not true. and isk making i make more isk out here buying from others and making stuff and then selling it than i did in high sec
---
alts, more alts
---
if you want to do explo, 3 strats spreading out and eating a system is good way to do it, so you aren't impacting each others income all that much but when pvp happens you can come assist
---
Siege weapon is an amazing idea!  An "Asteroid Slinger" that throws asteroids after 48 hours or something
---
&gt; I have 8 smartbombs on a disco BS.
---
All 8 would get 'queued up' and the server would pick them up when the next tick starts. It's unclear which damage type will get applied first - it's probably random. 
---
&gt;two ships are at 1pct structure.
---
Their shots would also get queued up, and then I assume it would come down to latency to figure out who dies first. They might both die. It's certainly irrelevant who cycled up first. *However*, if their weapons were cycling to begin with, and then the final shots *re*cycle on the same tick, that's important. This is because damage application and calculation exists independently of the server tick, and is applied instantly. So the person whose cycle occurred first would come out on top (I assume), ignoring latency.
---
Guess Ill wait for him to log his alts in, more killmarks on my dread

GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

Lol how
---
Correct
---
aww, the blurb of this posted sounded great, I click through and it's gone )-:
---
Honest question, will CCP attempt to do anything to aid new players in joining small groups rather than the meaningless blobs like test and goons to support and give joining players a real sense of community and ability to make freinds.
---
There needs to be some reward or benefit for joining a smaller group other than the more meaningful interaction and help they will get from the interactions.
---
New players should be aided I. Joining small groups than the well known ones that make them lose interest.
---
What we do, is after we drop caps......squirrel!
---
"In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."
---
A POS you RF it once, it dies.  A citadel you RF it 2-3 times, it dies. Citadels also have damage caps, so it always takes 30+ minutes. And citadels still reinforce when unfueled, unlike POS’s, which were killed without RF.
---
TLDR: shooting citadels is worse than shooting POSs

---
Two thoughts: thought one, offline structures don't increase fuel consumption in a sysyem. Thought two, if your opponent is incapable of preventing anchoring of structures in their space and you're willing to expend billions upon billions of ISK keeping your structures fuelled at the same time, go right ahead man. Seems like a fair field to me.
---
I remember the old POS problems, but as others have stated (without the "lol space politics" jab), we've traded one cancer for another. 
---
I'm not saying just flat out cap stations with no other changes, but that some kind of cap with changes that make it reasonable for attackers to take space would be nice. Who wants to grind structures all day?
---
Small? Every single one of us would buy one. 12 people is plenty big enough of a market.
---
Okay lousy lou.

For anyone else. Try an Orthrus, a Keres, and an Oracle.

Help a new Bro, pls gib isk. Let the circle continue.

It's the same people. Goons switch to their Tapi alts when they want to roleplay "oppressed rebels."
---
I do believe that some sort of catch up mechanic is a positive thing, especially for intermediate newbros. But I don't like skill injectors because all they did from that perspective is shift the wall from time to $$$ instead of helping. Also catch up mechanic means just that, catch up, it does not mean insta Rorq or insta Titan pilots. Numbers, values etc. all TBD per acquired data.

Must be ghooooooooooooooooosts

no botters in the corp im a member of and if one of use is found out that person gets the boot. if we notice botters in other corps we collect all info that we can and pass it on . a lot of those times that corp as a whole got the boot. got some goof balls who afk rat, which i find stupid but oh well.  before this war got started there was skirmishes with roams and pvp groups everyday. joined in a few of those. "i die mostly in pvp oh well it was fun" rent doesnt seem to be bad making money is good 
---
btw this little post i made has gone on for longer than i expected thanks to all who had a genuine answer and keeping it civil.
---
For those of us living under a spod rock for our Delve masters, what's going on?
---
For Corp ops, loot goes to Corp. Gotta pay for those free enyos somehow.
---
Hmm.. i see some juicy abuse potential in this.
---
CEO sounds like a tool. Guess that makes you his wingman.
---
I'm not sure I'd like being line member #10000. Just another easily forgotten F1 monkey with nothing to say. I don't know maybe I'm picturing it worse than it really is.
---
after that you drop a salv rorq and get to work
---
I won't go political here, but it is my understanding that humans in generally can be shitty. How the GOP is considered the "worst" makes no sense as, mentioned before, any party can be shitty. I don't know about you but there is no difference between a shitty party and another shitty party. Please don't be tribal.
---
I'd certainly support a limit - SV5 in catch was an example of how ridiculous it can get...
---
NO, we have had that shit before and it did NOT work.
---
The Drifters and the Collective are at war with each other, but the Hive isn't really relevant to what the Collective is building because we've been destroying the Hives pretty easily.
---
Add a second low power phase that kicks in when a building has been low power for 1month+ which means that there are only 2 timers, 24 hours apart.
---
No this is not true at all.
---
There are no illicit in-game transactions.
---
To my knowledge, Brisc has not broken the NDA at all. No-one, can suggest he has because none of you know any of the details. From what I know, and what I am allowed to know, this whole episode is a complete shambles. 
---
Pando and Dark have not been complicit in anything either.
---
The true facts will be published soon enough.
---
Well the link is for the group "assault frigates" so.... 
---
Unless I'm missing something?
---
&gt; poses arent that much better.
---
If you attacked a POS it had a single 72hour max timer till you could remove it permanently.
---
Just keep it fueled.
---
It must be broken I just see T3D's

Or maybe it's just the ability to see the kills of a certain class of ships.

Hilarious !

Coulda just been a joke about doing something stupid while drunk. The hmb meme confuses me.
---
You filtered the kills for assault frigs is my guess.
---
Darks' Molok was posted for sale on 27th Feb 2019 on Goon forums. Anyone can go see the thread which is still up there. That's months before the winter summit and any supposed NDA breach allegations would have taken place (they didn't). I am optimistic that when this is reviewed more fully, evidence and common sense will prevail.
---
If and when we get "walking in the station" back. And whether we can then set up our own corp office, like a bar or a club or a techoffice or what ever style we like. Maybe some players are willing to pay 5 euro/dollar in plex to get a golden statue of their CEOs into the office....
---
Are you tring to say that there are Assualt Frigate there that you dont recognize as being in game?
---
you know someone is desperate when they source their meme templates from /pol/
---
We will be fine. I might even have to FC again and welp loads of shit. But it won't come to that, the guys will be back soon. There are going to be some people very worried out there when that happens \*hint\*
---
PL isn't an alliance, it's a nursing home.
---
I mean zkill is showing there being 17 ass frigates, which there aren't.
---
I worded my post terribly.
---
There isn't an assault frigates based off the hound, Tristan keres etc.
---
Wait until the facts come out :)
---
Yes, my brain really failed on the original post
---
I can't even imagine having this kind of low level drama
---
Well the 3/3/3 layout makes it useless.
---
But even another lowslot would still be useless when the kiki can just do everything better. Some role bonus may help maybe?
---
&gt;We're getting warmer
---
There arent 17 assault frigates in eve tho, that's what I'm trying to say.
---
Just a dumb joke cause pvp fit noob ships with officer mods are a popular secret santa gift. Ignore me
---
They are ATships. Look in game under special edition ships
---
There are though. THey are special edition assault frigs
---
SWEET!!  let the sansha, trig, drifter war rock all of new eden
---
I heard goonswarm is starting a real cheap renting program.
---
Definetly not burning other peoples renter space to help their decision to go there
---
Playing both sides so you always come out on top. The Mac method, I like it.
---
Send your nudes to Anomilk Dairylover in game and the mean birds will leave you alone.
---
Rapid lights are fine lol
---
Absolutely. /u/Sentient_Blade's question is very much a loaded question, which not only won't give a useful answer, it will also spoil the atmosphere for any further questions.
---
There are a few things I feel would help in the direction to backtracking, even if it couldn't be fully backtracked. They're kind of the standard talking points from the rest of the community from what I gather:
---
-No reinforcement on structures that start at low power.
---
-No tethering from low power structures.
---
-50% drop chance for stuff in a citadel, just like a ship kill. The other 50% could go to asset safety.
---
-The ability to store and swap between multiple clones in a single structure, so people don't put up multiple personal astrahus' just to store their clones (which I know I do and the most recent CSM minutes suggest other people do too).
---
On that last one, making advanced clone services that could store more clones but cost more fuel would be fine.
---
Do you agree that those would at least be improvements, or did you mean that you don't like the idea of player-owned structures at all (just trying to interpret the pos statement)?
---
Solo kills : the dude that killed it 
---
Multiple people/Fleet kills : loot goes to srp if losses happened , if not the corporation buy it and split the loot between people involved
---
I have literally never mined, rat, explored or done anything in my entire eve career, only loot. I have docked dreads in order to use a ceptor to ninja loot. My ceo finds it hilarious
---
Oh, I see. 
---
Those are AT ships.
---

---
Gallente/Serpentis is pretty darn good since you get "contaminated" stuff that's in high demand for various Upwell rigs. Amarr/Blood Raiders is the worst because Goons have flooded the market.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVShqn30thI
---
Hmm, how difficult is it to loot in a titan? Lol
---
Yes, your first sentence is correct.
---
Feature implementation often isn't that great at first, in many games. It's the iteration on / refinement of those features that I wish CCP would be a little quicker about.
---
A good question would be to ask about CCP seagulls origin vision and roadmap, and see if that's vision is still in place, and how far along we are with it. Hilmar has spoken about reiterating on old content to make it fresh, however the game is stagnant and these fixes while welcome won't fix these problems.
---
But they do fall, timescale is long though.
---
My two cents: I consider myself pretty and careful, and I lost a Mackinaw to a pack of catalysts in a .6 system. I'm sure they had a scout because they came straight to me. Even pre-aligned, they got to and popped me before I could get away. And I initiated warp almost immediately when they entered the system.
---
How long before the first trig fleet kills a NPC Sotiyo and makes off with a Molok bpc?
---
So was the whole motorcycle accident and paralyzed not real? Was there a friend that used his account? I only saw a tiny glimpse, but it looked spicy.
---
This is seriously the best thing I've read on thi subreddit in a long time. I would absolutely love it.
---
me too thanks
---
I do it this way every third time I put my shoes on.
---
Don't need a dread to kill vnis and over domis.
---
I give TEST about.... 3 hours to have dino art in triangle format.
---
Is the ore generally the same in combat mission spots?
---
For some reason, I feel like you’re playing the game the right way even tho being a ninja all the time is a dick move, but I’m guilty too haha.
---
Honestly mining or ratting is the most mind numbing part of the game, I occasionally afk rat while I do other things to make a bit of extra isk but that’s about it and the occasional exploration because I find the mini game/rng fun..
---
If you don't know the intended purpose of carriers you shouldn't worry about using carriers
---
I really want to have an abyssal site designed for a dread where you get mutas to roll on cap parts.
---
&gt;CSM could immitate this by having a certain number of nullsec seats, a certain number of FW,  Lowsec, highsec, pve, wh,  etc.
---
That is a great idea. I would like to add to that list: people from small alliances and people from big alliances. Prominent members from large alliances will naturally have an easier time to get votes, because more people have heard from them. People from small alliances won't necessarily have heard from people from other small alliances, so the votes will be a lot more scattered there. But these small alliances do deserve to get their voice heard!
---
Shows how much you know.  Horde doesnt fly hyper stabbers anymore.   We die in other fitted stabbers now.
---
Nice. What's your reasoning for not splitting missiles on the cerb and loading different ammo types to break through his reactive hardener?
---
&gt; 1) Instead of delaying local, what if the Triglavians instead 'jam' local and translate it all into their trialphabet?
---
fixed none of the problems with local while managing to add more
---
congratulations, you're officially retarded
---
Yeah I get what you're saying. The blade and the erinye were the original concept ships for the assault frigate before they changed to the current iteration. They got modeled in game but never made it further than that. The models were reused, afaik the blade model became the Freki and the erinye was turned into an npc ship, not totally sure about that tho. As for the ships, they had 100% resists to one type of damage, and strong resists to the rest, but barely had enough fitting for guns. You can still look at their stats on the chruker website.
---
The gatherer and the kishar (I'm pretty sure but not 100% about this) were concepts that eventually became the prospect and the endurance. I'm not sure why they're classed as assault frigates.
---
The dagger is a bit of a mystery. I'm assuming it was an original concept for a stealth bomber, the slot layout is 3 launcher 2 turret, 5 high 4 med 3 low and it has a sig radius slightly larger than a light drone. It also takes over 50 hours to regen it's 250 cap.
---
I don't tend to pay attention to the wrecks until everything is already dead and people are hovering up the wrecks. I don't really loot much except in a field clearing loot rorqual for strategic purposes.
---
The Damavik does have 2 utility highs over the kiki, it just can't use both of them because the fitting is garbage.
---
I think that's a decent place to work on making a niche for the Damavik, some kind of neuting platform, or maybe RR?
---
Originally when I saw the Damavik I was envisioning a sort of "giant killer" frigate, that eats at a larger ship that can't hit it because of its speed and agility, using neuts and ramping dps to overcome active tanks.
---
I think it's more to do with the fact the other two didn't sign any NDAs
---
Reserach Raitaru now: 1,5 bil (481 mil + 1,1 bil in t1 rigs)
---
Research Raitaru then; ~5 bill (4,8 bil + 110 mil in t1 rigs)
---
Bonus: Keepstars get expensiv as shit so less docking for supertits...
---
0 is not my case
---
&gt;CCP said Wormholes would be uninhabitable and look how that turned out.
---
Turned out pretty well, actually, given that wormholes are just about the only place worth living now, between the BS politics and the blue donut null has turned into.

Dude, they don't want to *recruit* us, they want to *assimilate* us.

I would have upvoted, but for that last paragraph.

Can I upvote your comment more than once?!?!?!
---
he was orange.
---
Your tears sustain me.
---
Isn't that how they were before they were nerfed about 5-6 years ago?
---
Imo all of nullsec has just become a playground of saftey nets..
---
Looks like it was a good fight.
---
Carriers got nerfed hard years ago. I brought 4 BPOs to sell copies, but now they're barely worth copying. Demand has plummetted.
---
Holy fucking shit dude...you're talking massive programming to get rat mechanics to work the way you're asking....no way thats gonna happen soon
---
Not sure how to do this , keeps saying account is being made a billion times 😒
---
Id say the naga isnt the best, but hey his call.  If you go Tengu maybe toss the third in an ecm/neut/repair role if you want to run the same anoms.  Personally, id say run 3 t3 cruisers separately then meet up if shit hits the fan.
---
 &gt;!that's the joke!&lt;

All of these plus a slow decay to low power structures. Reactor core not being maintained or something for lore purposes

When are they bringing back the Alliance Tournament?

What do you expect though?

Remember the new diamond rats that would destroy citadels and players had to fight them off ? Where they at ?

I would love the salt if it was actually implemented
