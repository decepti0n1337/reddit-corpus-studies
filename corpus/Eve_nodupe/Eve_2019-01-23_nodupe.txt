Easily in the high 5000s .. I don’t think it’s as bad as it seems size wise but it’s enough to cause concern perception wise..
---
I don’t think RMT is as bad either as you could flood the market with supply but folks with very expensive long term investment chars aren’t going to buy due to fear of ban permanence..
---
In truth the bots as horrible as this sounds inflate the metrics enough to project growth but aren’t obvious enough to dilute the metrics ..  they still fuck the economy with unnecessary inflation and unfair buying behaviors as well as cloaky camping PSTD  issues but on the whole it’s fat that is likely factored into daily business metrics in CCP.. for every botter there is a consumption of plex .. for every plex price increase there is more consumption of plex..

Only ppl who benefit is ccp though the rest of us just eat shit on this issue sadly 😞

Maybe he had caps lock on tho

Solo wh life is definitely doable, especially with the preparation you’ve done already. An unoccupied C2 with a null static will be hard to find but there are lots of other options for frequent C5, C3, and NS connections. Playing solo is more enjoyable than in a mega coalition imo, so do what you want on that score and ignore the “solo is boring “ naysayers. If you do join a wh corp, it can give you a boost in learning wh-space mechanics though. No one is immune to eviction but if you keep things fueled you’re not too attractive of a target.

I don't really keep up with goon affairs... but did he not run for a senate seat and lose.

So when you say a real politician; you mean someone who failed to become a real politician.

Fucking delete this

They won't ban bots because they prop up the game's population.  
---
I like market solutions
---
I haven't assumed anything.
---
It's all about image.

If CCP banned bot accounts they would slash their player count by at least a fourth overnight. 
---
They won't do it. 
---
LOL! Slow down there turbo.

who will be the one to continue the wall once you burn out after a month and quit?

You're tired of Elo making 5 posts over the last 2 weeks, but haven't complained about either Brisc or Stainguy, interesting 
---
Anyone who can trigger a goon this hard is obviously doing gods work.   
---
I might be dumb, but was anyone else confused by the loss description in the Legacy/skill fight?
---
For some reason I misread 10b isk total destroyed as "10b lost by skill/scourge combined" or "10b lost between scourge/skill's machs and muninns destroyed" (also "munnins" is a minor spelling error in that paragraph btw).
---
I was confused how a 10b vs 9b fight could be considered "one-sided". Regardless, great post, and great summary of the news. Keep doing what you're doing!
---
The real r/eve plot twist would be spending more time in-game than on reddit.
---
yeah, they where test owned, or well blue to legacy. ( jumping an alt around there no longer around it seems might have been from 1 of you former renters to be fair ). 
---
How do you think it compares to the hull gank fit?
---
I set my PI colonies to 7-day cycles, adjust my sell orders to be on top, and then find a system with some relic sites, or go minerbumping, or run a couple more SoE missions...stuff like that

Are you wearing a wizard hat, peradventure?

And that fixes botting how?

So no, in other words.
---
Can’t, Goon alts. The GSM will throw a fit.

Solo pvp bots have yet to be a thing.
---
I was in the same boat, but found a corp through reddit to scratch my itch. I’m an ex null f1 vet that wanted back in the game after 5 years away to do things casually. I’ve gone from f1 to learning exploration, mining, industry and just general passive income whilst I can get on with RL.

There are corps out there for casual gamers.

It's really nice when they admit they're concern trolling.

The ones with missile damage bonuses. Skills and a decent fit are what provide the DPS as long as you are using a missile bonused hull. They are no different than any of the other weapon types in how they get their damage boosted.

I don't care about mar5hy. I do care quite a bit about Eve becoming a game of mindless tribalist propaganda more than a space video game where we blow each other up.

It would be a real fucking shame if people ended up following that guy again considering how quickly he's willing to sell people out.

You are psuedo praising a company for letting you spend more pre-order money on their fictional product?

Kinda boggles the mind. I mean I'm not gonna say rorqs are reasonable or balanced, or that the resultant depression of mineral value and cap proliferation problem those cheap minerals exacerbate but it's stupid to blame Goons for playing the game they've been given well.

theres literally nothing different between the goon liner member and bl line member, login hit f1 logout, go back to burners or mining or whatever.

The meta was always mass alts, it just took a modicum of forethought and planning.  Now the same is true, just some twat can decide he wants another alt NOW, instead of 3 months in the future.
---
The plan is to move in and get situated then start pulling friends into the hole a couple weeks later. 
---
Don't fret.  Most of this reddit whine is uneducated idiots raving about something they have no clue about.

For somebody so concerned about eve becoming about pushing viewpoints, you seem to be pushing a pretty ridiculous one.

God damn valk if you were anymore retarded you'd be the querns of tapi

Yup, and with the implant it's very hard to not just click anything on the board and live.
---
Yeah. I think he does have something of a point - I'm sure there are large numbers of bots under the Goon umbrella, and some of them will be doing it for RMT.
---
But to nail an individual and ban them is hard. He blatantly had broadcasting on and rightly got dinged for it.
---
&gt; If CCP banned bot accounts 
---
The CCP execs and investors would lose a bunch of cash because those accounts are tied to the bonus metrics of the post-sale period.
---
Yes I'm biased towards not trusting random discord screen caps because i understand how easy it is to fake them

I believe this is what the kids call "trolling" with a side of "flair bait." If it's real...well then have a copypasta to last until the servers go dark.

Eh...?

This is the reason why I keep coming to this sub even after a year of winning Eve. NER reporters are the best kind of reporter New Eden needs AND want - I still lurking here because I like space, space games and still playing them (but not Eve) and NER reports fill the void that is in my heart. It's like, when I'm reading these reports, I am aware that a whole other reality exists (New Eden) and It's mind-boggling - Eve Online and it's community is fucking surreal. 
---
Please don't stop the reports. NER is probably one of the best things ever happened to Eve Online. Thank you to all the NER writers.
---
and how soon would you be jumping into the same thread about goons, saying the same thing?
---
I'm not sure about the Naglfar (but I imagine it's similar), however even with 4 damage mods (good for Incursions, less so for PvP) a Leshak is still not approaching HAW dread DPS levels- it gets very close, but it's not quite there.
---
For reference a full-spool max skill 'Shak with 4x radsinks is \~2450 DPS cold, 2818 heated. HAW Rev is \~2800 cold, while HAW rapid jesus Phoenix is almost 4k DPS cold. Even on just two damage mods a HAW Rev is \~2500 DPS cold with faction multi and a triple, rather than quad, BCU Phoenix is still 3700 DPS cold with faction torpedoes.
---
As for the 750k EHP Drekavac... that sounds like HG Slaves, A-type EANMs and abyssal plates to me. Which is to say that if you throw money at something it gets ridiculous pretty fast with little difference.
---
I mean I think I have been overrun with all this positivity today. I truly appreciate the kind words, from everyone including yourself. 
---
I am glad that you get enjoyment from reading our content even though you don’t play the game anymore (for now ;) ). We try our best to report on the things happening around New Eden and will continue to do so. It is only made possible by the amazing community that CCP Falcon says never ceases to amaze him with our propensity of “loving to blow shit up”. 
---
I thought you went AFK
---
Never because I don't trust discord leaks unless I'm in the discord and saw the post
---
What part of this is yard for you to understand? Every single discord leak on here was either leaked with the intention of swaying your viewpoint or faked with the same intent. This shit isn't hard. People lie. It's Eve. You're buying it and it's not flattering

The Caracal is a good entry-level missile platform that does well in both PvP and PvE. Fit rapid light missile launchers for PvP, and heavy assault missiles for PvE and go from there.

Some complex gates also have skill requirements. But that is not new.

I'm Arab-American but I've met a couple of Middle Eastern guys, most of them while running incursions. The first I recall encountering was hot-micing and we overheard (I'm assuming) his dad giving somebody a rather severe Egyptian scolding. It made me smile. 
---
I've also met a small handful of Emiratis and one guy from Qatar. Early on I did put the idea to a couple of them that somebody could maybe put up a chat channel as a hangout, but nothing came of it.
---
The weirdest interaction I've had was with this one dude from Algeria. As soon as I mentioned to him that I'd spent time in Libya he launched into a tirade about how Gaddafi had the country run like a paradise but the evil western nations decided they wanted him gone, because they are preoccupied almost exclusively with the Arabs and how to keep them down. We'd been chatting for about fifteen minutes at that point, and after that I wasn't so hot on my chat channel idea :(
---
xanex.

The hull gank fit gains the double webs and can rely more on defensive mode.  It will have a slightly larger engagement profile than the shield counterpart that relies on the other pilot to also want to be in brawl range (luckily this ship can dunk targets before they realize they really don't want to be in brawl range).  The hull variant also uses a bit less capacitor.  An adaptive invuln costs nearly as much cap as a 5mn MWD.  
---
Both fits have roughly the same EHP outside of defensive but the shield fit fairs better against blaster boats by having a bit more kinetic resist in the shield.  For the hull fit once you bleed into hull you're going to want to find a place to dock or sit in space and let a hull repper top you off (takes a good bit).  Also, by the time your tank is failing in the hull variant you might not have enough of a chance to bounce.  In the case of VNI hunting as a shield Hecate if the target isn't in deep structure and I hit armor I drop into prop mode and bounce.
---
If you're just looking for some relatively quick PvP I prefer to have the majority of my tank recharge between fights.  The T2 Core Defense rigged shield Hecate can rock a 14k ehp tank but those rigs are about 10mil a pop.  If that works for your budget it is very strong.
---
Finally, hyperspatial fit Hecates are great for ganking but when you get into a closer matchup you're basically saying "I'm doing this without rigs".  When looking at numbers people say "I know not to brawl a Hecate" but Eve isn't full of flawless pilots and you get plenty of people too eager to fight.  Shield Hecate relies on that outside of straight ganks.
---
**TLDR: Hull tank:  control is good, less cap needed, more downtime between fights.  Shield tank: you don't dictate range in non-gank fights, more cap, less downtime due to passive tank recharge.**
---
To be honest, I am not too interested in krabbing in J-Space. I would literally only move there for the PvP content. The only thing is that I would like to eventually bring some friends there, and they would be interested in the PvE aspect of J-Space. I will keep this in mind though. Thanks for the advice. :)
---
Skrillex Urself [WithBass] ? 
---
I know you don't mean that, but just think about the fact (there was a post about it last week or so) that CCP had twice as many employees 'before injectors' as it has now.
---
When you say wind up wormhole groups, what exactly do you mean? As for scanning, logistics, scouting etc, I'll think about it. Maybe I can convince a few people to join sooner rather than later.
---
Got tldr'd right away. Shit.

Just retire already moron
---
A 2-5/n is probably one of the few exceptions to the rule that you probably wont be evicted unless you're obnoxious or a huge loot crate. They're very popular. If its really want to do it by yourself might consider a C1/3 instead.
---
I'm that pilot.  That fit is definitely just for covering ground and straight ganking.  Something to consider though is NPC aggro is unreliable and there are plenty of sites that just swap to the Hecate when it lands.  Having the invuln is nice there.  In the end there will be some engagements where the web makes the difference and some where added tank will make a difference.
---
I've flown a number of different Hecate fits.  When it comes to just dunking they all have their niche.
---
I'm more inclined to believe John than the guy who has a history of lies and deceit. But okay.
---
Pando is pretty good. I've flown under him, but Elo is on a level all by himself.
---
He does nothing but post about how awful Delve is. Botting, Grrrgoons ruining the game with their unconscionable defense of carebears, blah blah blah blah it's always the same content, just a wall of words that describe whatever feckless whining he is on about. It's the same every time. 
---
&amp;#x200B;

I know he started doing this clever thing with his drone piracy, but I don't think it's worth you numbskulls sucking him off for it at every opportunity. Have some pride.
---
Nice! Now we need to pair it with some 8-bit music
---
Nice, that's me.  Last two days were roughhh.  If you can fit a scram onto your VNI and let the Hecate get close to commit there's a good chance it pops while you keep burning away.

Until then, best of luck in the real world.

Both are casual as far as average corps in eve go. You will be one face in many in both corps and you will have round the clock content. If you want ultra-big fights go with dreddit, if you want content delivered to your staging go with brave.

this is a bad post
---
Community interaction people never really last long in the gaming industry. 
---
I've been in both for long periods of time. Dreddit is simultaneously more laid back and more srs bsns. Dreddit has a more laid back culture, and dreddit corp fleets generally are chill and not "win or you're bad", but we also value playing to win, try to be the best version of ourselves and improving. In terms of culture, Dreddit  BNI is a weird mix of really laid back about some things, and incredibly strict about others, both culturally and in game play. Ultimately, the first question I would ask you is "Would you rather have culture and speech heavily policed or not?"
---
You do if you have a carrier but aside from that most fits that don't suck are smart bomb battleships or drones

Dreddit all the way. We have some of the best mentors in game and there is constant content. Eso is a better home imo plus the infrastructure is way better. Check out dredditisrecruiting.com and come hang out in discord and see the culture...mention you were thinking about joining. Every one is super friendly and fleets are laid back but fun. Dreddit is also active on all tz so you shouldnt ever be bored. 
---
If you want to get more involved by running fleets or blopsing there are plenty of opportunities to better yourself. There is also plenty of krabbing/ mining going on. I really recommend checking out our culture for yourself in discord.
---
Hey, haven't seen your miserable ass in a while. Hope you're well.

Contrary to a popular belief on Reddit most null sec ratting bots are in the vast majority omega. You can easily check it by killing them. It is quite rare nowadays to kill vnis without getting a killmark. You used to see alpha battleships a year ago or so but that meta has entirely switched to omega vnis. Might be that ccp is more proactive when they detect abuse with alpha accounts or might just be that the botters have enough investment cash to go for omega straight for better profit.
---
I mean, keep going with this one if you want. Just means PGL got beat by an "FC bot".

Oh snap. Kinda a low blow there. Maybe Elo just didn't have to poop during that fleet? I dunno.

Unfair comparison. Goons cannot get many KMs due to fact that by time you lock something it's dead because of asshats with sebo's and fleet size.

Man your tag is really fitting. 
---
" when they can just spin up a new one in 20 minutes. " If their attempts to get rid of bots wasn't so half-assed this wouldn't be possible. The only way this becomes possible is if they don't follow the money to the main character running the bot alts. So they can just use it to fund the next wave of bots, or if they buy it from RMTers which by now should be dead and gone if CCP really was tracking the RMT market like they have claimed they do. It all comes down to CCP putting a token effort into solving the problem so they can LOOK like they care when in reality they don't. They just leave Pel in his closet and ignore the whole issue.
---
If you pay me 5 trillion isk, I'll delete my reddit account.

Someone should make a bunch of ceptor bots that just endlessly roam bot infested areas.  you may not be able to kill them, but if they dock up every 10 minutes you've done one better by cutting their isk potential down.  then when they stop docking up for a character, you take that character over as a hunter....

---
&gt;injectors make it possible to instantly make a new VNI bot after your last set get memed
---
not confiscating the botted isk you use to buy the injectors for your next bot is what makes recycling bots possible. If they really were taking all the money the accounts make when they kill the account and tracking down all the money it laundered to a main character and banned that one as well there'd be no motivation to bot as it would mean losing the bot, your main, and all your in game money when caught.
---
i think that's the idea in theory and probably is intended but clearly entire waves of VNI bots are getting replaced after being banned so :thonking:

Well, we don't have greyscale anymore, so yeah. Everything and anything is fozzies' fault. 
---
but querns is cool :(
---
Anyone responsible enough to do the job well
---
i like it when people tell me things i already know
---
how do you get the data back? this only works for UDP btw.
---
At the begining of 2018 u could farm that way a drifter bs, after fix u couldnt but this way is still is working with usual sleepers. Which means ccp counts that a legit mechanic even if you are not.
---
Why do I not doubt that?
---
i have lived in provi for many years, i too feel these changes and have seen how the smaller group has less recourses and tactics to use against the larger.  i let my sub lapse in part because of this and also due to quite a few glitches (game breaking ones imo) that we are experiencing these days. i also feel the progressive changes are occurring to frequently. the game just feels too unstable these days.
---
Implying it isnt already 
---
I desperately need that galaxy pack sale. My rorq alts need training!
---
Pterodactyl Shit* Bird Shit*  (fighter damge) get it right! Lol j/k Chevis. I'm going to go watch Splintered Paradigm now. 
---
I was in CVA and old Provi alliances, so I'd probably not notice the censorship much. That said, fewer rules is better. 
---
Do either of them have activity minimums? I work 50+ hours a week fairly often (IT in a law firm) and have a wife and two active teens at home so I might be inactive for a week at a time if I'm traveling. Would that be an issue?
---
I'm a team player and I used to treat eve like a second FT job. I just can't keep up that level of commitment any more. I would contribute as much as I can when my time allows, though.
---
that's really the best you got? You're the type of dude who rants online about how terrible posters everyone are then gets shit face drunk and beats your kids. How many times you leave bruises on them? Or is just your girlfriend/wife? You're a prime example of emotional damage encased in an absolutely uninteresting shell manifesting itself online. You go around trying to be all holier-than-thou by picking on random posters in a spineless attempt to make yourself appear socially elevated. The saddest part about your whole schtick however, is not just that there's no point in doing it, or that you're the only one who actually cares if you feel that way. No. The saddest part is that you doing that is literally the laziest possible way to that, seeing as how it requires no actual social backbone or personal stake at all. Almost on par with using a typo as an attempt to discredit me when I call you out about being full of shit. But that's obviously right up your alley. Lazy. The thing is, I already know that this isnt going to change anything. I'm sure you'll just reply to this with "u mad bro" or some other uninspired, emoji-ridden abomination of a comment in an attempt to derail the reality that you are a husk of a human being who bases your entire identity on lame attempts to put yourself on a pedestal at others expense. The biggest difference between you and I though, is that I'm not writing this back to you to win this reddit thread. I'm only writing this because I take satisfaction in knowing that no matter what you could possibly say back to me, deep down, I know this shit rings true, and you need to have another human being to remind you who you really are underneath that fake shell of yours. And I delight in being that person for you. ❤

Will do. I’ve got a c. 173m main with Titan V, plus a 156m nyx/dreads/fax and a 72m subcap specialist on 3 accounts. All 3 are covered on everything from intys, logis, hictor’s, dictors, intys, 2 x blops plus bombers, recons, t3’s, command ships so pretty well covered for all fleet roles and all 4 racial comps. Just looking for a chill home I can stick with to krab into a couple of supers and mix up some different PvP fleets to keep things entertaining. 
---
right so clearly its not working as intended, the only explanation is they are not getting all the money, and its just going right back into making more bots.
---
*Elo Knight would like to know your location.*
---
yes as far as actually running the sites you are correct. you can get both a t1 relic hacking rig and a t1 data hacking rig. My point was more about scanning.
---
 say you take a "normal" pvp fit astero. you drop a bit extra on a sisters probe launcher, sisters probes, but no scan mods/rigs. you hunt explorers with it. assuming max skills, 104 probe strength. plenty for the normal data and relic sites you'd want to hunt in. 
---
Now say youre the buzzard. you've got your hacking rigs, your 3 scan mods and a prop mod and a hacking mod to run sites with. but you're an explorer, and you know those dirty asteros are mean, so you stick to a t1 probe launcher, to save cost.. 113 probe strength. so sure, you get 10% stronger scan strength. which is certainly respectable. but youre dead to rights if caught. I personally go the astero and hunt explorers route, and carry a depot + hacking mods if i get bored. but its eve. you do you.
---
wormholer btw
---
Semantic warriors are the lowest form of terrestrial life.
---
Sadly.
---
Yeah, titan 5 is a bitch. Just finished it an an alt. Doing doomsday 5 now. Blarggggg
---
Isn't there some sort of bleach you could drink to hide your posts from us?
---
No.
---
Look, a retard in the wild.
---
Why did you reject my contract for the cost of the MTU you so unceremoniously destroyed, huh?!
---
The spod brains won.
---
o7 warrior.
---
&gt;How do you not upload to zkill? 
---
Make a new corp and don't login to zkill. 
---
&gt;what happend if the C2 i move to has you in it? 
---
You can contact me and ask to join. Or be ready to fight.
---
If you'd be so kind as to show a fit that does prove this I'd be happy to change my ways.
---
&gt; There's explo bots too
---
TIL. How that even works? 
---
You don't understand. It's a huge conspiracy and we're all brainwashed to not realize it.
---
I loled
---
kinda bored lately tbh. took three days off after ship spinning half the week. Logging in to another tidi fight makes my head hurt thinking about it. Eve has changed and I don't like the direction it's going.
---
Incorrect. Violence against nazis =/= violence against innocent people. Violence against innocent people is wrong, and the modern neonazi ideology preaches just that, so they deserve *every* fist or bullet they receive.
---
Yeah I thought that too but I didn't want to shock the pubbies with too much truth all at once. I usually leave that job to you, so I'm glad you're here lol
---
That estimate seems high.
---
EVE is haram
---
Goodness, little Timmy, such naughty things you're saying. Bad boys need their mouths washed out with soap!
---
one of my better posts tbh. 
---
can confirm that even just being the second-hand man made me want to neck myself ingame after about six months of proper alliance leadership
---
:joy:
---
More like the Minor
---
well I like to be optimistic
---
Would you allow me to use this as a discord emote? Lovely. 
---
Hah, that was you? That contract was pretty funny. Balance paid in full plus interest.
---
Riot poach?
---
Not a fan of EloKnight, and not sure he would take CSM seriously, but I don't take it seriously, so I guess its ok.  Honestly, the best part of his platform is getting the self serving Brisc Rubal off.
---
Likewise, you need your cranium washed out by a small chunk of metal moving at a high velocity.
---
He's done his stint as CCP's whipping boy and has been promoted to a position where he doesn't have to deal directly with end-users anymore.
---
You do know that you're supposed to get over your 中二病 when you become an adult, right?
---
bs....he died somehow, so you propped his corpse up in his cube. and are trying to pretend he's still there so you can keep collecting his weekly beer rations
---
stop, stop, they're already dead
---
although I do find it hilarious that there probably are very few places that aren't covered by one of the big three supercap umbrellas at this point, so being on the bad side of one and not being a big boy yourself makes you basically irrelevant
---
I don't speak moon rune sorry.
---
Heeeeeeeeeell no
---
We've tried WH corps in the past. It's always ended terribly. 
---
Is it just multiboxing that allowed for subs by the TOS or botting as well?
---
Neither of them have minimums. 
---
Thanks!
---
Honestly at this point CCP just needs to create a dedicated anti bot team or even open up not reports to the community. This way people could sort reports by character and then vote yes or no this is a bot. Of course you would need to link your account and be omega to do so.
---
He's a smart man. Hopefully he's busy figuring out how to stop our server from ending up like the Chinese server.
---
Why did you cross out poor Xenuria?
---
&gt; with the way y'all
---
this is a goon and legacy sub who are u even talking to
---
The first point is the big one. People wouldn't bot nearly as much if the PVE in this game wasnt so incredibly boring. You can pretty much just orbit a thing, launch drones, and go afk. The worst part is that if CCP nerfed drone ships, it would definitely cause people to quit because honestly I wouldn't bother with EVE if I had to use a turret. It's just so boring. You lock stuff, hit f1-f8 and wait. The PVE that is actually interesting is usually pays out poorly.
---
Tri is not allowed to post on reddit so they must be dead
---
&gt; it becomes impossible to compete unless you bot 
---
Lol git gud
---
Damn dude you really got me there says the goon poster
---
Do you have to go to school to become a professional victim?
---
One more round the Botters to the ground.
---
Fake News! I don't see Mar5hy ban on there
---
What exactly do you want, when you spout a variation on a tired meme? Spouting memes is the essence of groupthink.
---
Measuring employee count as the health of a company’s product is a very crude measure indeed. During that time they were likely taking in a lot of investment money to fund their Vampire MMO and FPS and VR projects. I know we romanticize the notion of CCP robbing the cradle of EVE Online revenue to fund everything, and I don’t doubt there’s some of that going on, but I don’t think that’s the whole (or even majority of) the picture, either.
---
I think it’s the knowledge now that I’m at the age where I could die of prostate cancer before I get all cap skills to V I find the most depressing. Damn these pesky millennial kids with their full 500k injectors. 
---
What’s the point of a rorq alt if you give CCP money
---
your maths is incorrect. maybe would be a good idea to not call me a retard every post if you can't even get that right.
---
I miss you 😘 
---
I don't think there has ever been a saltier little bitch in the history of EVE lmao how is it possible to get this mad over a video game. I don't know what goons do to get people so upset but they're definitely doing something right.
---
yeah kinda of a cheap shot on the prostate cancer.
---
Chicken and egg... which caused which: CCP adding skill injectors and going F2P or CCP not producing anything more interesting than refineries or moon mining in an expansion since going F2P?
---
What good about that?
---
Cool story.
---
We don't have cubes, we work in a civilised office.
---
The OLDS titan is a snuff character lmao 
---
my nigga
---
Your like so cool, like literally the coolest guy ever, like honestly SO  FUCKING COOL
---
Mods, ban this man!
---
I would ban you again for doing an AMA about your ban.
---
It puts the comment on the thread or it gets the hose again.
---
I'm Lebanese American, hit me up in private message will hook you up with some of the channels or people if you are looking.
---
I know, I even mentioned that CCP have never acknowledged this as a bug and no one ever got hurt for using this.
---
Nevertheless, using plain simple common sense, we can figure out that this is, indeed, a bug/exploit.
---
Idk stop posting maybe that seems like a good start
---
https://youtu.be/KF32DRg9opA
---
I think the community is better without being able to throw racially charged language at each other.
---
Nothing about tri being bosoned for their fortizar final staging timer...
---
Perhaps take a few mins to read the EULA next time
---
instead of lying and checking the box saying you have read and agree to them
---
its a crucial point.
---
idiots say "oh they just spoof their ips and its no problem"
---
sure, you can use a VPN. however VPNs have a direct cost which eats the botter's bottom line, and as you burn bot ips you start to run out of useful space to use. which just makes it harder for botters to operate.
---
Now why the hell would I do that? It's not like I have any respect for you.
---
#getfuckeddumbass
---
Shhh you're ruining the narrative. Goon rorqs are obviously all bots even though that makes no fucking sense at all
---
Been playing Eve for almost a decade and I just joined Dreddit after spending a long time in wormholes or elsewhere. Culture is laid back, people are chill and many (like myself) are more than happy to help out new players. Would recommend.
---
Wasn’t intended as one. My dad was diagnosed and passed away in that timeframe, and every time I see a certain skill I was doing it reminds me to get a checkup. sorry if it caused offence. 
---
I get your point, but even real brothas know when and when not to say my nigga
---
Shame. The wormhole life isn't for everyone but it is fun. 
---
Albeit it was a rocky journey buy the dynamic of braves wh corp works pretty well nowadays with our nullsec friends. 
---
Oh my god... what DO orphaned drones do actually? Just disperse and wander the universe aimlessly?
---
Test can't do wormholes without the filthiest of stupid drama
---
My first and only tip would be stay away far far away. It's an old game it's not getting better you will always play catch up and realize you wasted months even years for nothing.Now with developing company being owned by an even worse company you can't expect any great things.
---
Is Dickvirus proteus still a thing? Been a few years since I won so not sure if it's still possible...
---
😎
---
Absolutely, I do that very often to not go in 100% blind in certain situations. I've flown with people who genuinely, non-ironically care about their killboards and being Isk-Positive. They weren't fun people.
---
u/hittings_ixgard Their series of unfortunate events happened *after* the 1900 was posted. It will be in the next one. 
---
I would be pleased if twenty years later people would still find time and dedication to look back at this humble random internet dude's ancient posts just to be amazed what the f*ck he were thinking.
---
Not every poet could left such an imprint in the history.
---
With a blackglass implant and a frostline analyzer you can 56 attack. 
---
&gt; **update** ban overturned after contacting CCP customer service directly. Got an apology and some goodies! Thanks CCP, The GOOD GUYS WIN AGAIN! 
---
Did you tell CCP your were black?
---
Don't make yourself an easy eviction target. Fuel your structures, be cordial with your neighbors when you have them, and if you really want the hole, make defense a high priority. Established medium sized corps and up will largrly ignore you especially in a C2 which is rarely ever used for krabbing by these types. Other solo-ish players or small corps are your biggest worry in a 2-5-null. Others like yourself might take you out and set up their own operation similar to what you're doing. I've personally done this before and seen it done several more times. A single dude, even with a fueled Astra, is an easy target and potentially a very profitable one. *Read: there is no asset safety in wormholes so when your structure dies, it drops loot.*

Once they realized I was not the white devil it all turned out to be some sort of misunderstanding...

Oh I forgot to add- If I'm gonna park my ass in a 7-10bil ship you bet your ass I'm going to be active, on comms, and watching Intel like a hawk.
---
  You guys should rework the anomaly npcs first make them more similar to abyss npcs with more tackle some RR higher dps and speed and more ewar
---
Bring back God's Army 
---
What if it turned out that both of you were cancer and you should both eat dicks to stfu.
---
Ooooo! Spheres! 
---
I used the isk i earned from how fast you can run sites with a frostline and a blackglass to inject arch and hacking V to get a Zeugma, highly recommend it.
---
Scrub, gotta use a program that changes your IP before logging in the next account, otherwise the votes don't count. 
---
Ah open plan. Very fashionable. Loud though.
---
It's no wonder nothing gets done.
---
then give him goodies!
---
oooo NOICE
---
&gt; the more bots there are the faster this game will die off as it should... 
---
Post your lossmail
---
Pff... do not pretend that you made it...  This is a screenshot from CCP's new mobile game.
---
Similar cultures.  Brave's Stay Classy principle is mainly don't use slurs in comms.  Most everything else is fine. Some people don't like this rule and are happier in TEST.
---
This is a snip from the post by our founder that defined it: https://i.imgur.com/FCcPhYU.png

Good people in both, lots of fun in whatever playstyle you want from mining, indy, small fleet, huge fleet, capitals, etc.
---
Each group supports new members and has plenty to do on a daily basis.  
---
Welcome to Legacy!
---
Wasn’t intended as one - sorry if it offended.
---
plz this
---
Is it open plan? I despise open plan. I once had to work in an open plan office right next to the fucking sales guys. Those assholes were yelling into the phone the entire work day, making it nearly impossible to concentrate.
---
Missile Launcher and Projectile Turrets are the most versetile Weapon Systems out there.
---
Both are capless, are not damage-type locked and have outstanding tracking if fitted correctly. That makes them preferable in both PvE and PvP.
---
Missiles got the huge bonus to scare away any PvP tackle since they can't get under your "guns" and also can't outrun them while orbiting.
---
Missile boats like Gila and Rattlesnake are considered to be the best choice for PvE.
---
Even for highend PvE c5-c6 combatsites Tengus or Gilas get fielded in groups, in T5 Abyssals Sacrileges, Cerberus and Gilas are used to clear them fast and for DED 10/10 or rank10 combatanomalies like Havens etc. Rattlesnakes are top to clear them with Sentrydrones and Cruisemissiles.
---
In PvP both Cerberus and Jackdaw (Missiles) see active use since The Imperium fields them on a regular basis against PanFam Munins (Projectiles).
---
Also several Missileboats like Modus Legion Garmur or Orthus are known to be cancerous.
---
There are really good ships in all empire skilltrees, or pirate faction wich make use of missiles.
---
--
---
Lasers got higher range and can swap ranges instantly, dont need to stop and reload 10sec - they can keep firing but are EM/therm locked and got crap tracking. If you field Lasers against Minmatar T2 ships you are fucked because of those nasty Minmatar resistances 90% EM, 70% thermal. If you get neuted out in PvP or PvE (bloodraiders) and your capacitor dropps to 0 these Turrets cannot shoot! If you swap Laser Lenses you might use more Cap or less so you really need to look into that.
---
Hybrid Turrets got huge tracking, best of all Turrets but also got problems with Range and need to reload too. They're thermal and kinetic locked so they're very weak against both Caldari and Gallente T2 80% resistance profiles. If you get neuted out in PvP or PvE and your capacitor dropps to 0 these Turrets cannot shoot!
---
Projectiles got different Ammunition Types for different Ranges and Tracking, making them adapt quite well to certain situations and enemy ships. Also they have different damage types so you can kind of avoid shooting into huge resistances. Using EMP, Phased Plasma or Fusion covers most damage types, also much like Lasers you got many different ranges with Barrage and Hail etc. Projectile Turrets can't be neuted and will still fire if every other shipsystem deactivates.
---
Projectile Artillery got the best alpha (oneshot) damage in the game, thats why Tornados get fielded so much in Highsec.
---
Missiles combine many of those traits. They got really good application against every Type of Ship be it closerange or to snipe them. You can choose specific damagetypes wich don't mix like turret ones. Light Missiles, Heavy Missiles and Torpedos got two different launcher - normal ones and rapids. They shoot same ammunition type but with higher frequency. Missiles see use in every System be it PvP or PvE because their broad arsenal of launchers and ammo makes them adapt to very specific combatsituations.
---
Also their delayed traveltime compared to normal Turrets might be great in certain PvP encounters.
---
Missiles allways hit your enemy if they're in range and are not too fast to outrun them, making them apply mitigated damage even to the smallest targets where turrets wont track anymore.
---
They can't fuck things up worse than CCP has.
---
I mean I ran against wars for half a decade
---
Had the same thing happen to me, except the client name was some keyboard face roll nonsense. Buying 1 ammo per minute for 4 hours. Thanks for the isk!
---
I see you are too dumb to realize that I tried that multiple times before the clip started. 
---
Your flair says that you're in BNI. Ever thought of joining spoopy newbies?
---
Nope, tried manual piloting out of it. I've only ever has the bug occur in the abyss.
---
It may show you guys care more, for example, you took some of the popular player feedback and explained why it cannot or will not be implemented. 
---
A lot of great suggestions get made by people who spent time thinking about it. You guys have had no hesitation outright being rude(in normie standards, normal eve standards) in the past, so I can imagine you're capable of reasonably doing this.
---
Cools cool, now animate it! 
---
Holy fucking shit you're unhinged.
---
Just something I did a few years ago. Just had the nerve to post it and see what others thought. I can put up a high res version if there is interest. 
---
stfu goy
---
This game is full of pussies now what can ya do
---
What if it turned out that you are a human shaped pimple on the gene pool that should be violently euthanized?
---
[Signal Cartel](https://www.eve-scout.com/signal-cartel/) is great for your situation, which I can say because it’s my situation too. They’re a great combination of casual, but super structured and organized. And everyone is incredibly helpful. I stated Eve about a month back, joined them about a week into that, and it has been *awesome*. 
---
Only possible “drawback” is that they’re primarily an exploration corp with a very strict no pvp* policy. So if that’s not your bag, then you’ll definitely want to go elsewhere. I’ve just now stated dipping my toes into the Eve-Scout Rescue stuff, which is basically a completely alliance-run search-and-rescue operation for players stranded in wormholes. You can contribute to the efforts mostly solo and while you’re doing other exploration stuff, which is cool because you can line your pockets and also contribute to the greater good all at once. 
---
I mean like... My school does have a literal class called \#MeToo
---
I worry every day they'll be discredited. 
---
Weekend at Fozzies
---
Wolfs you miner, what would you know?!
---
Is there any sane way to know which Reaction formula requires which Reaction Service Module? I just found out that I can't do Gas reactions with Biochemical Reactor module...? Or am I doing it wrong? Do I need a Hybrid Reactor to run polymer formulas?
---
How do you think rogue drones come about?
---
Red enters system
---
VNI warps to station leaving drones
---
Drones: *'No daddy don't leave us! :'(*
---
VNI logs off
---
Drones: *Fine, we'll go make our own ratting space, with blackjack, and drone hookers! C'mon guys let's go, my cousin runs a nice infestation in Malpais that we can crash at for a while.*
---
How do you report in game? I don't think the "reporting ISK spammer" is correct, or is it? 
---
Don't bother arguing with this guy. He's basically drowned in koolaid.
---
I remember when I thought I was an edgy wordsmith in my teens.
---
I feel similarly. This game has moved too far towards a no-risk mmo where the time and effort you put in does not translate into what it used to.
---
To put it succinctly: *It's still the game it used to be, just not the game it was.* 
---
this is the content i come to r/eve for
---
Even with Elo being afk in the CSM, he would still do a better job than that Brisc idiot..
---
I see you are a pompous ass. You make wildly incorrect assumptions based on a minute long clip, and then try to present them in the most obnoxious way possible. I tried everything thing you suggested before the clip began. This is just the last few seconds of me in panic mode.
---
It didn't work when I went to use approach, if you actually paid attention to the clip instead of just looking for someone to troll, you would have noticed it started flying upwards again.
---
Because zero transversal is better than exponentially scaling damage, dumbass. As a blinged assault frigate, I could tank even direct hits from that BS for some time, and all I was trying to do was get control of my ship back, then I would have maneuvered as combat required.
---
I hope you learn not to jump to conclusions and be such a miserable person from this.
---
Yeah it makes sense, doesn't it?
---
He has a six week fatigue period after each post before he can post again.
---
If CCP went with our ideas they'd have listened to the focus groups and CSM who told them the rorq changes and injectors would fuck up everything and look at where we are now? Everything's fucked.
---
#Underated Comment Upvote this you Mongs!!!
---
you, sir, wouldn't do well with with a Hunter S. Thompson book. You wouldn't get past the first chapter. 
---
&gt; what happend if the C2 i move to has you in it? 
---
Please PLEASE check carefully if you moving your stuff in ACTUALLY empty wormhole if you're not planning to evict current owner!
---
Some unexperienced dudes once installed their Astrahus in my hole. The whole experience was horrible, I had to spend the whole night before work to kick them out! And I felt bad for them because apparently this little Astrahus was their most valuable asset, and I had to destroy it. I checked their killboard a couple of months later and their corp is inactive. Still feel bad.
---
For the mother of God, check the system before moving in!
---
Irrelevant info though, as everything he suggested I tried before the clip began, to no avail 😁 If only he had been kind about it, he wouldn't look like such an ass.
---
*Classic Tri*
---
fuck avrse tbh
---
CCP is full of brainwashed liberal nazis, that's the only problem. But they seen their error and fixed it like all brainwashed liberal nazi do once reality catches up
---
Weekend at... Fozzies?
---
I don't feel like this is a client side issue as it has happened to me on different clients, and other people as well. Seems like a server communication failure
---
lmao but u said gf ???
---
Obviously Muninn?
---
Tbh it makes me sad that you made it past your teens.
---
i said " gf, more like good gank" and im laughing my ass off at how you react to subcaps
---
When I heard Tri had 200 dudes sat on a titan, this wasn't what I expected to see
---
Is downtime spawning still a thing? Rolling downtime would be pretty hilarious but I imagine that could have other unintended consequences.
---
I'd think it would be ideal for spawns to be random, bit I bet that's even more fragile than chat.
---
dude thats not cool
---
I've been playing since 09, so no welcome needed, but thanks anyways 🤣 This is clearly an issue with the way they have implemented something in the game, and is in no way due to pilot error or negligence. This is exactly the kind of thing they should reimburse.
---
CCP wants to know your location...
---
[TRI Right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdFl__NlOpA)
---
Taking a holistic view of CSM history, I would posit that troll CSMs end up with similar effectiveness to tryhard CSMs over time.

Why did you repeat the video. Oh wait...
---
+1 truer words have never been said

CCP is the real culprit behind RMT
---
Brb gotta make a crowdfund quick.
---
u shouldve added a lil GAMER humor by saying gf more like gg
---
tfw TRI doesn't even know how to failscade properly, fails at that too.
---
The obvious answer is boost hulks. The 300iq answer is a torpedo destroyer.
---
fuck snuffed
---
Pretty sure where I live we are allowed to blow up blue cherry pickers, this should be a rule across all space 
---
I think the thing now is arty Loki with deactivation mods, like 4 seconds total to lock an astero and can alpha them in like 2 shots
---
I only support saving rmt money to post elo's bail the next time he goes to jail :( 
---
muh space honor
---
I bought a bunch of the frostlines shortly after the event expecting them to be worth it.
---
Interesting. Both times I've encountered it were in the abyss. Unfortunately, relogging in there isn't really an option, especially in an active tanked frigate. 
---
Only similar bug I've encountered in K-space was years ago when I was -9 and flying a Nemesis through high sec. When I came through the gate, I was cloaked, but moving at like 4m/s or something like that. Had no ability to control my ship at all, so just died to police when my gate cloak ran out. That time I probably could've survived with a relog, but I was young and dumb, and had never encountered such a bug before.
---
Pretty sure this bug is unrelated though, as this time i had acceleration control, and the ship would respond to commands, for a moment, then continue on it's suicide course.
---
You didn't deny beer rations being a thing. 0.o
---
Same lol...I didn't start playing around with fits with em until now. They're very worth it; a lot more than I expected tbh. 
---
Old reddit only reddit
---
The most egregious stuff in the bonus room wasn't even pushed by Erotica 1.  Some of the other actors were much worse, and stayed in the game long after he was gone.  I have very mixed feelings about that ban.
---
Please god don't let him touch stuff... we don't need more damage caps or entosis wands. We just want cold hard dps killing, no bots, and maybe a finished aeon hull
---
I think this is a little different, I clearly passed the edge of the area, I just didn't do so from pilot error or negligence; I simply had no ability to control my ship due to what appears to be a server communication bug.
---
Fucking snuff killing lowsec
---
I stopped using MWD ships in the abyss. There are many reasons, but a big one is the "Oh shit I, went to far too fast and now I'm gonna die" moment I had once.
---
So that's how a bus works, good tutorial! 
---
Hi joe
---
Feels bos man.
---
He was called olmeca silver back in the days but one day he lost all his assets to a goon recruitment scam , he then achieved gold status and sworn that he will have revenge
---
This has only happened to me twice, both times in the abyss, where relogging isn't really an option, especially in an active tanked frigate.

4. I hate PL

5. Did I say I hate PL?

6. I love Goons cos Goons hate PL.

7. I hate PL.
---
8. (bored now) something something low-sec gate Stain.
---
I really hope they don't give me the same response. I'll give them hell over it. I have a hard time seeing how this could be anything other than a server issue, unless the base code their entire client runs on is bugged, but I feel like that would still be entirely on them...
---
That's a shame. If they're going to incorporate new content inti the game that requires high risk, they should make sure that content actually works, or at least refund losses due to bugs.
---
zeugma dick lmao 
---
But any evidence of botting? Intel alts are a thing for people with lots of money/cloaky campers
---
I used to buy game time through Amazon, for both of my accounts. Just selected a different name in the little drop down box, I think it was. That's been a few years though, not sure if anything has changed.
---
ligature deez nuts
---
No movement control whatsoever. All I could do was cycle my AB on/off. No type of movement commands were working, including stop. Neither method of manual piloting was responding either.

The nyx botter that was killed earlier this year by some guys trapping it in a bubble, flies happyl to this day in PIRAT

Check out Abyssal sites! You can do up to T3 sites in lower SP T1/faction cruisers. While they're not a gold mine, to give you an example, I did a stream earlier and in the 3 hour stream I had made a grand total of 700m (Evepraisal buy/sell estimate) doing an hour and a half of T3 sites in a Sacrilege and an hour and a half in a Retribution running T2 sites solo. 
---
Abyssal sites are nice because you can do them anywhere, you just need the filaments, and all 1 site requires is a maximum of 20:00 minutes (because at 20:01 you're dead!. 
---
You didn't need to be in the csm to see ripard run to every media outlet he could find, lol
---
I mean, I was, but that doesn't change the fact that nullsec is nothing but blob F1 monkey fights and ratting.
---
Dreddit actually makes it easy not to just be "one face in many". 
---
It's true that there's many members who are just that and identify as a member of TEST mainly, rather then a member of Dreddit. But there is also a surprisingly small community active on the corp discord and the corp's mumble channels who embrace just being a corp and do small gang roams, gatecamps or blops deployments together.
---
It's always the same 15-20 people on corp stuff, so it kind of feels like a regular small-ish corp if you decide to play that way.
---
Yeah until they tackle you instead of the vni

Imagine hovering over a massive fleet fight.

I can feel the frames dropping already.
---
Maybe Snuff are Olds alts? 
---
I don't know if you are aware of this or not,  but CCP actually announced that they were looking into the options of being able to lead npc fleets in the future to do things (including fighting). They didn't give us a timeline for this at Vegas, but it was announced and generated a pretty big reaction from the crowd. 
---
Leshaks can go even more stupid than you realise... there also not immobile like sieged dreads

Black people cant say that word because it was invented by white people. It would ve cultural appropriation
---
Are they really that PC? I mean calling someone a racial slur isn't okay on any comms (sry tishu) but "fucking retarded idiot" I hear every day
---
I imagine their thinking is the because it's a limited time module, the price of frostlines will eventually outpace ligatures (and probably zeugmas) over time so it was ok for it to be a better. Which was why I bought some when they were still cheap. =P
---
They've completely redone them since then anyways. If you click the "Agency" button on the left menu (should be near the bottom of the list) there should be something on the "suggested" tab. If not you may have to bite the bullet and make a new toon
---
I thought being AFK was a key part of being a CSM member.
---
Not for a person sure. As an "isk" activity its an issue.
---
PvP.... Yet
---
You might not be able to redo the brand new starter intro.  But you can do the career agents since you probably did not do them before.  Agency tab and drop down on type and select career agent.  Start convo and see if available. Maybe try to add the rookie channel too? 
---
There is inflation in eve.Isk is worth less and less.Prices will probably never drop.
---
Which systems, what time? I'll camp some bombers on the sites 
---
Alpha accounts are free sooooo you COULD start a new free account and do as many tutorials as you want to. 
---
Ohh boy lol. The 1st one ok. The 2nd one you bubble and warp into you own bubble and the boson.

YEah they use asic miners these days

Let us mock them,they bring content..

Very cool vid
---
I know a guy that was shot down for saying they'd rather work on a certain holiday. Ive been bitched to for calling hardcore crabing "autism mode" (apparently it's offensive to autistic people which was news to me, as guy with mild aspergers). There was a kerfuffle over a depot named "rape cage" during the seige of UALX.
---
These kinds of reactions are pretty common in BNI from my experience and 99% of the time the offender is just making some offhand comment not even directed at anyone. Ofc it's not a "this happens 5 times a day" thing but after a while it becomes pretty noticeable if u spend an amount of time interacting with ppl.

A lot of them will be gone after they reopen chinese server

Look on the goon forums, search his name.. you will find many amazing "stories"

He went from golden boy with top updoots to pariah after one patch.
---
It's a shame, too, because he's a great poster.  Great game dev, too, but he's still doing that.
---
True story. People need to at least happy they got content, seems to be taken for granted these days.
---
I think Tri needs to try and hitch a ride on a shorter bus
---
Great day for that titan pilot.
---
Open plan is nightmare fuel for my introverted self. I can barely stand it when one somebody is looking over my shoulder, much less a whole room full of somebodies. 
---
C2s are great for solo living. Speaking of, I happen to know of an empty C2-C2/LS and the owner of the POCOs is looking to sell. ;) C2 sites can be run with a myrm or better yet a gila. Although you will make much better isk when you move to C3 sites.
---
sounds like my top 8. Stain is also great content. Try it.
---
It sounds a lot worse when I type it out like that to be fair. Most people and most of the time it's very easy to chat with people in BNI. There's just a subset of people that seam to enjoy pissing in people's Cheerios like that. I can't speak for most corps but I've interacted with spoop deqc and that one weird named one that starts with a y and mostly all interactions I've had outside of mainline BNI have been drama free.
---
i've got used to things like that maybe two years ago.

nothing new, it's current state of the whole game

It goes Lig -&gt; Frost -&gt; Zeguma in power.

The frost ones are so good because they are better than T2 and the Ligature, with only level 3 skill reqs.
---
If you have not done the tutorial using the Agency tab, then you can do the entire tutorial from the beginning. Just find "The Seeker Investigation" in the Agency tab, and follow the instructions.
---
If npcs had actual mechanics like being neutable this wouldn't be a problem.

Something is "not right". I have no idea how to fix it. I'm not the person or company that is paid to come up with ways to fix these problems.

bet they weren't a patch on the loud, aggressive, customer services ladies i used to be sat near.
---
Interesting.  I didn't know you were giving full reviews of the taste.  Come back when you're relevant on your own.
---
You're correct.  You won't be missed.
---
CCP should have an in-game corporation (Kind of like CONCORD), who roam nullsec looking for bots. It would not take much to do this. Five or Six employees, or one in each region; like a beat cop.
---
It is if you're a self reliant Imperium member. 
---
If not.... probably not. They're notoriously self loathing. 
---
just your mic. 
---
and they finally did something about that but the results were debatable. One person isn't going to get botting addressed. Its been an issue since I started in 2009 and its only gotten worse int eh last 10 years its going to take the whole community slapping them in the face with it for months on end to get a response that results in more than meaningless PR stunts like the Highsec teleport thing.
---
This game is rotten with them. They need a fresh start. Eve 2.0.

No skill injectors this time.

We demand proof of life!
---
Not saying it will not happen.  But spent over a year in a c3 with hs/c5 statics with 2 other guys and never had any problems.  Started off in a POS and by the time citadels were added had met up with 3-4 other guys who joined us. dropped a citadel built some fax (when they were added) and some dreads to defend.. Never got to use them heh.
---
Honestly we rarely saw anyone and only on a couple occasions ran into a group big enough to be a serious fight.  We used paladin, golem, and rattle for c5 sites and eventually went with 3 nestors.  
---
Given I haven't done the sites since they changed how payouts are done (with the drifter at the end) so I'm not sure how much that changes site running.
---
/r/woosh
---
Having an actual player-base also helps keep the game alive though. 
---
you ok? having one of those famous brainwashed liberal nazi breakdowns? Should have gave a trigger warning, im sorry. 
---
thx
---
More people in space regardless of whether they're paying for the game contributes towards the health of the game. As there are more people for paying customers to interact with. Eve is 'dead' enough, if they removed all the FTP players, player count would drop heavily which I'd argue is bad for EVEs health.
---
Legend has it that the magic words are "Butterchurner".
---
this is brilliant to see
---
To be quite honest which I always am, not a single person in our Corp knows who are you, even knew you existed until you actually logged in then you went full retard (never go full retard), than I proceeded to kick you and made sure to link your mail several places, and not only was it comedic for crew and me, seeing you bitch instead of just leaving like a proper man it was cringe worthy good job 11/10 WTB more hate mail https://imgur.com/gallery/qa8sGyo

&gt;if they removed all the FTP players, player count would drop heavily which I'd argue is bad for EVEs health.
---
There is no way to prove that because they have yet to release a FTP v. paying player stat showing how many pay and how many don't, they have only ever released active player counts
---
I don’t think anyone with a straight face would look at the in game ux and go “now this is how user experience works at its best” .. often it’s not the big ugly ux issues that cause issues it’s these little nips / cuts that is hate debt we bank with compound interest ...
---
For example jump to cyno navigation is a context click menu ... ok no issue if all are friendly cyno.. since jump beacons now you can potentially jump a jf to an outbound hostile beacon because of a miss click .. some would say “we’ll be careful in future” others would see “cognitive load theory says fuck you on all fronts Hicks and Fitts law “

I love open plan. I socialize with my coworkers more, makes relationships a lot easier to form
---
C3 with hs/c5 static? C3s with two statics or statics to C5s dont exist?  
---
Regardless though, thats comforting to know. Choose a hole thats out of the way and not widely vied for, and you can live there without much competition... maybe one of the 100 C3 with null statics.
---
Besides Zkill and looking for structures, how else can you check?
---
Ultimately TRI won, for they successfully denied skill urself content and became a content farm for oldschool instead.
---
I have seen your offices. It makes lesser cubicle dwellers cry in pain.
---
To my knowledge they arent really a PvP focused group? 
---
Netflix manages to blacklist all those IPs.  You use 90% of VPNs and they don't let you watch anything.  VPNs can be blocked.

afaik darkness stopped renting, I think a lot of the former branch renters just folded into r-r
---
Maybe a c2? Hrm now o want to log in scout rottin there to find out.
---
Stick with one thing as primary tho, each one you listed has enough value by itself alone to get you elected.
---
We do bomber and AF fleets quite often. We take advantage of ls/ns statics that our c3 static provides.
---
Great story. Sadly, I've been hearing comparable stories for ten years. If Eve is dying it is some sort of undead creature that can't be killed.
---
You can do the seekers investigation as many times you like. Its in the agency tab, you might have to search for it in the drop down menu.
---
Looked it up. Was a c2 with HS/c4
---
Was damn good money back in the day and super quiet.

Oh yes those are the worst, especially when they serve german related market.

'My piloting wasn't the best,' continues to pilot better than I ever have in my life. Nicely done. :) sweet OsNI kill!

Having private titan fleet faster?

Maybe Boting Legion [BL....]
---
Ah yes, I'm USTZ. . Every time I go down to the SPOOP public channel on mumble, its empty. :(
---
Other options with frequent C5, C3 and NS connections being a C4 with C3/C5 connections, and relying on the large percentage of C3s with null statics to provide content?
---
Having bots devalue the isk isn't helping either. Inb4 20bil monthly sub just like serenity. :)
---
Blops in your logistics? Couldn't I just wait for a highsec hole or find one in the chain?
---
Money won't be much of an issue, its just getting evicted would require finding a new empty C2 with C5/NS statics to set up in again.
---
You say they are using you to cover their mistakes. Forget their mistakes fucking learn to harden the fuck up and deal with the fact that you fucked up big time using input broadcasts. You drop 200 bombers on goons you make a video with your stupid surgical mask on and ya feel proud about it. You input broadcast reddit makes 5 shit posts, and ya cry about it?? Deal with it.

The later being offensive and the former, in context, is culturally acceptable to say if you are of proper descent. If not you have to have mutual approval by at least 3 non-related representatives of the Afro-American community and be in good standing with said community or be accepted by said community with proof thereof in the form of a "fam card" or "street name."

---
Yeah we can be pretty bad at our feedback, but please remember that it is us that need to compete with this bots.          
---
We need to :      
---
* **farm more** - as in many places they are driving prices down.                
---
* **pay more** - especially for PLEX as those RMTers love it.              
---
* **witness RMT renting empires** - for years they are visible on New Eden map (BOT, KWG ... do i need to say more?)                
---
* **engage with bots on daily basis** - try to compete with market bot, or make some isk when there is a supers/VNI constantly cycling anoms - in some cases you know they are bots as normal player cannot super rat for 12h, 7d a week.     
---
Please don't get me wrong - i know that CCP do a lot of work.         
---
Numbers you present don't lie - thousands of accounts banned ... and you need to check all of them, this takes time - a lot of time.        
---
What we need is more visibility , a constant visibility.          
---
**People asked for this many times** - make all banned characters land in a corporation called Prison or Bot Legion.          
---
If people can see constantly raising numbers - they can see **how much was done and how much is being done**            
---
This kind of visibility is very important - trust me.           
---
Players also want and can fight the bots themselves - what is also important players are also good bot prevention mechanism.           
---
If your space is a dead end - your bot can run 23/7 as no one is moving, yet if some neutral guy show up every hour - the 'active' time is getting significantly reduced.            
---
Based on this - please adjust map. Give us a NPC stations in drone lands and ways to enter places jak PB, PS or Omist much easier.        
---
Let us help you - and what is most important here - let us remember that we have this so we can help the fight.        
---
People love this kind of initiatives.           
---
Above all - thank you for your hard work.   
---
It doesn't, but nothing ingame can fix botting anyway. So, try to work with the symptoms and make them less bad while you ban what you can. 
---
I’m just trying to imagine your level of squint on a scale of 1 to 10. 
---
If you have to explain it, it's not funny.
---
I'm at around 170mil and quite tempted to extract this gas mining and related to it skills - but as my first nullsec was a WH space i constantly stop myself from doing it as it reminds me why never move to WH space again.

&gt; Well I manage without a problem multiboxing 4 VNIs while being semi-AFK playing another game
---
you are the problem you mong.
---
Shame that it takes ages to find relic sites.
---
It’s like local chat. CCP tried to use the new thing, and it failed.
---
git gud you fucking krab
---
That would be very disappointing, keep in mind we are flying 1.4b ships on this field, a insured dread or carrier can travel faster, do more DPS, tank more and cost less after insurance.
---
If they touch Leshaks without thinking about capitals I'm not sure if I want to continue playing, we are not going back to 100mn Lokis.
---
Fighters already limit the nano playstyle to the point of making all MWD ships without sig bonus impossible to fly. With just HACs, 100mn ships or frigs viable the game just feels too limited.
---
Exactly that! Thank you!
---
Although that qualifies as well.
---
All speech is hate speech. We should only use the words given to us by our Lord with the wizard hat. PBUH.

Now i don't know if you try to offend white people or give them credit.

I honestly don't see what's controversial about the fact that 'stay classy' also includes no rape or autism jokes. You said something that people reacted negatively towards, it's not the end of the world, just move on instead of doubling down on it.

A single vni bot makes 1.2bil+ per fuckin day.
---
A super/rorq fleet gets you a trillion every month.
---
Ofcourse Plex prices are rising. 
---
And CCP can't do enough sales to match them really.
---
Rmt rate is like 4-5$/ 1.5b
---
CCP has to either stop both rmt and botting or make more isk and mineral sinks
---
If ccp learned how important and useful revenue is for business they would remove the galaxy pack limit. The only thing saving me from myself is their choice to handicap their own business model. 
---
We're laughing at a salty cheating cuck

Probably, but imho this subs is exaggerating the amount and influence of bots by a wide margin. My theory is the main driving force behind this being the current, more peaceful state of the game. Everyone can farm up, doesn't have unexpected expenses and increases their number of rorqual/gank/afkcloaking-alts, all while feeling entitled to NOT pay irl-money for it. Who actually needs to buy plex currently apart from some highsec wales?
---
You'd think it's hard to be worse than CCP but there's present day Blizzard as the shining example of turd that you need.
---
I'm alpha cloned, and I earned over 300mil over the weekend in a sub 1mil heron. I did get ganked by an astero, but luckily I didn't have any loot on me. I also got destroyed horribly by a ghost site! Fun times. Exploring is definitely a solid 8/10 and would be higher if I didn't waste so much time on scanning.
---
scan a relic site. camp it with smatbombs
---
If the jokes are not directed at any person or group quite fucking frankly grow some skin if that offends you. 
---
Wow.  Is it so wrong to discourage rape and retard in comms? For rules, that's about it.  It's pretty stinkin laid back other than, you know, not being an ignorant dick.
---
My VNIs make it possible for me to PLEX accounts and buy PvP ships that afterwards serve to pound asses of inbred people like you you fucking piece of shit. 
---
Lol 😍
---
Don't bother with all the loot caches just go for the bioadaptive
---
something something Rorquals jajaja
---
Says the guy that looses a VNI to a "brick Nidho", drops a Leviathan and still manages to let the Nidho live haha wtf. You guys are jokes. 
---
its a race against the others and bots lately.
---
last night i found a level IV and a III on the same system. damed proteus. kept chasing around took me a while to double back. got distracted by a 8/10. bots took the sites off. 
---
That is very wrong. I often end up having more from the extra loot than the bio cache, it's getting ridiculous.
---
... instead of tripling down. :)
---
Perhaps depends on the level you are doing, tier 5 it is only worth getting during the killing, not extra time 
---
people that hate mining ... but eve is bleeding those pretty fast. 
---
This is what happens when you spend your weekend in the basement with daddy
---
Get a faction AB, ignore ennemy tracking, killg web and neut rats first. Move straight for the extra caches and finish with the bio one. Ignore angular velocity, you don't really need it unless you're in the krybalos BS thing which hurts quite a lot. If you feel like you're going to run out of time getting a cache, don't take it. The krybalos also should be the longest enemy to kill so prioritize him over getting loot. I've had no issue getting 95% of the loot running the sites that way. For the record, this is my fit :

Thankfully unlike brave slack i dont have the fear of being kicked from the alliance on reddit when I say something that 3 people dislike.

How to kill your game 101
---
m8 i slam dunked ur atron and u know it
---
I could be wrong, but I think the spirit of the stay classy room is that you shouldn't need a thick skin... If you're smart enough to get on mumble to work in the first place, then you should have the cognitive capacity to behave like a civilized human towards your fellow blues... Also, Brave is a big sprawling cultural soup, so a casual slur from your perspective can be seriously offensive and hurtful to others... If your enjoyment of the game requires you to make others uncomfortable on Comms then you shouldn't be in brave... Go join goons, you'll probably get a medal...
---
Grr, stealing my reddit karma
---
Just because mining and ratting are the main afkable incomes doesn't mean they are the best. I mined maybe 100mil isk worth of ore in over 3 years. Escalation running is also a pretty fucking good way of earning income.
---
dunk slaming an atron is your general level, a retarded fuck that thinks he's elite chasing VNIs yet manages to fail a titan drop on a carrier loool
---
I hate it because it's harder to shitpost on Reddit...
---
Funny story - way back when I started playing, circa 04, If you left a drone and tried to go back for it, it would aggress you.
---
that would be amazing :D
---
The shit side of stay classy is it has no fucking definition. Ive heard literal shouting matches that've boiled down to "x took salvage after the fight before i could get my salvager" but they escalated it to that point in the name of "staying classy".
---
I'm sorry you have no perspective of the real world but I'm not calling your mother a whore and I'm not calling you the n word. Im saying I let my autism take over when I rat in order to make x amount of isk. If that insults you then YOU have a personal issue that YOU need to work out I'm not responsible for your insecurities. 
---
Brave needs actual rules not loosely veiled threats that literally boil down to "do exactly as we please which can change at a moments notice and if I'm having a bad day I'm gonna take everything you say as unclassy and kick you because i feel like it".
---
Give me actual rules to follow and I'll follow them otherwise stay classy amounts to dont ruin someones in-game experience and dont insult people because anything else and it starts becoming one of those "sometimes its enforced sometimes its not" rules. 
---
[removed]
---
Then alot have changed since Klapparstigur, if it is civilised now :)
---
It's okay if you forgot to insure the atron, I understand. 
---
Honestly, the only thing that makes me mad is that this fucking corp actually paid your bullshit, but at least now I know what's going on around. 
---
"This titan just bosoned half our fleet"
---
"LETS WARP TO HIM AGAIN"
---
My sides hurt.
---
I guess scanning is the hardest part to automate to automate, and the hacking game follows some simple rules which should be about as hard to implement as a minesweeper "AI". Warp to, orbit at 2000, loot all, and warp to safe when someone enters system...
---
So no one is pro botting ccp bans them as they find them, releasing numbers publicly. Every csm is against botting so what does he bring to the table above and beyond anyone else. The current CSM all understand it's bad for the game, that said I think we need new blood on the CSM. 
---
My questions with the platform he has are more about what exactly he brings to the table when "reducing lag, or better servers stability for large fights" I look at this and think unless he works for an ISP or in major involvement with IT and server infrastructure management with advanced knowledge of how to integrate eves processes into that strucutre. I dont see his participation or feedback being anything more than what we see from the everyday person. 
---
Servers need to be more stable, reduce lag... most people this is a ISP problem not a CCP problem, you play via shit internet yea it's going to have problems. I play on gigabit internet and have 0 issue with lag or connection, and haven't seen a socket closed other than Downtime in 3 years.
---
Servers more stable for big fights, ok how, they are pushing the boundaries of what's possible as is, and considering the age of the base code and engine it runs on it's not coded for multicore process load or to distribute processes to other threads/cores when overtaxed. Now I'm sure ccp sees this and want's to do better, it's the best thing for the game, and it was a prominent thing announced at vegas. Also big fights draw people to play eve. 64 bit client is a huge start for that, expanding the memory each client can use to the 64 bit frameworks means the 4gb limit is gone. Means less crashes in big fights. But most people wouldnt know that cause they only see the game lag out and crash not tracking that the game hit its 4gb limit or ram and crashed when it tried to load more. But alas the community response "reeeee my computer has 64gb of ram it cant possibly be a problem..." not understanding how 32, 64 bit infrastructure works and its limits. 
---
Tldr,
---
What does he bring to the table that others dont already and how is he in a place to really help on anything that he has as a platform. I legit dont know why I would vote for him over anyone else. 
---
I'm doing T4, and I generally finish killing the rats most of the time way before I can reach all the caches (depends on the type of waves). Speed is more generally my biggest concern to reach all the loot, not really dps.
---
You still think I'm dankguy, don't you?
---
As always ;)
---
It's very nice!
---
If it leads to more sites getting run, creates higher supply-&gt;lower prices.
---
Are you serious?         
---
Do you have a link somewhere ?
---
Your = your group, whatever how much you are, I don't really care. But I must admit that I have a pinch of admiration towards what you did. I mean, I personally would never have paid Dank's bullshit for the simple reason that you guys don't have the patience to camp and because I'm not your bitch, but I must admit that the corp paying it made me realize a few things about them.
---
Despite the fact that you admirably failed the Levi drop, bravo for the blackmail bullshit, it was art. 
---
TemplarDelve
---
That was...fucking....beautiful
---
The one who came up with the plex idea was fuckin genius, iam not even kidding. Do you pay money for subs? Good, CCP is happy. Do you plex? Good, someone had to buy it for money, CCP is happy. Are the RMT bots? Well, people are dicks, if there is no demand its pountless to create supply, so there is, bots that are actually worth something need to be subbed, via plex and again CCP is happy since someone had to buy said plex for cash. No matter the outcome, CCP always wins. Remove plex, problem solved. Its a toll for allowing chinesse farmers on TQ.
---
Undock and do it then, the only one stopping you is yourself.
---
Thank you for this ^^
---
Maybe I should go back to my opening comment. Your thoughts about me shouldn't influence your opinion of your corporation. You knew what they were doing. Now they've clearly ignored whatever opinion you had and let us, essentially 'win' after a fucking disastrous drop. That and, you know, the months of continuous botting and denial. 
---
It might seem like I have a personal grudge, but whatever grudge I have can never be considered 'personal' if it regards the insentient. 
---
The things people do to be relevant ..
---
Why, do you miss  him touching some important part of the game?
---
tbh the fact that you have "won" indeed is not because of your actions whatsoever, but ultimately only because they have even less patience than you have. It's not my thoughts about you that influence my opinion of them, but only what they do (or did), like for exemple paying you to stop what is probably the lames camping attempt ever and even more the fact that they actually negotiated with you to leave you farm in systems you don't own while in the meantime spitting on us.
---
I mean, I'm fine with that. Let thunder roll on them, at the end of the day it feels to me like it's deserved. I don't care anymore since what happened yesterday. 
---
I care
---
Interesting that Winter Co/ russian entities aren't the flavor of the month atm. People only give a shit if they aren't sided with them... pretty cringey attempt at caring 
---
Decent watch - shame about the drone swarm &lt;3.

p.s buy some drugs :P

Are you going to leave?
---
Username checks out 
---
did all those pods have clones, the mails all came up immediately, no 5min wait.
---
makes me want a titan....
---
At a given moment probably, just by sheer respect of myself. Will it be now ? No, will it be soon ? Maybe. I have other things to think about and to do right now. 
---
Believe it or not, I reported these bots multiple times (both to CCP and to the corporation), my consciousness is clear about it.
---
you should stick to posting in BDSM communities kiddo
---
Not much else. The whole process, more or less:
---
1. Check zkillboard. If one corp have kills or deaths in this system several days apart - something is wrong. Known exceptions: Wingspan, Signal Cartel - they travel a lot.
---
2. Check system for structures. You could enable citadel icons on system map. That should help with citadels installed far from planets, because they would have distinct icons. Then check icon stacks on planet by hovering them with mouse cursor. Should be no citadels. Then double-check your result by warping from planet to planet and spamming D-Scan with filtering that shows citadels. Also you may want to check for online POSes. For this you again use your D-Scan with filtering that show POS force fields, also you can double-check your result by warping to all moons in system.
---
3. If there is citadel in system - probably it's better to just go, BUT if it's in low-power mode (have text [LOW POWER] next to it's name when you're on grid with it) and if you REALLY want this system, you may check if citadel is abandoned. For this you need simpliest high-damage ship you don't mind to lose. Simple max damage fit Oracle or Talos would do the trick. Just shoot at citadel and see if anyone trying do defend it. If not - wait for reinforcement timers and destroy this thing, just to be sure.
---
alphas give killmarks now 
---
Gaara was pretty bold about using it, and also used it in PVP, which didn't help.
---
Consider a 'chav' as a monster, a council estate is their spawn point.
---
Right, because 40 Rorquals pressing PANIC, cyno, and recalling drones in perfect sync is just tournament gamer level reflexes at work right?
---
I'm happy to be sitting on 40 of em from farming the event combat site lol..... Holding out the day for when they are super valuable lol.
---
make ratting require a simple question and answer, although crappy, asking (2+2 = ) or whatever random question like once or twice per site SURELY would reduce if not stop botting.
---
Reporting Blue Bots is a Crime
---
Well anecdotally I can say that I know of quite a few people who are alpha only and wouldn't be playing the game if they had to pay monthly. As well as others who used to Plex and now only play more casually so don't see the benefit of a subscription. 
---
Interesting, I've been catching them in tier 5 on slow waves. I find it generally more worth it to blitz through it in 12 minutes and start a new one, but I cannot disagree on there being 10-20m in loot in those caches per room. To Op I guess the answer is l: if you want to go for it perhaps consider an active fit with mwd

---
Like I said, not now. I don't support bots in anyways, it disgusts me, I did my part to try to prevent all this drama and it failed for reasons I won't discuss here. 
---
I mean, it wasn't really glorious at all.  You threw a temper tantrum and then got kicked from a corporation you apparently hated being a part of.  Not that you were a part of it.
---
You just let BloodDonor use the kick button.  He vigorously masturbates to the thought of kicking tantrum throwing noobs, so thanks for satisfying him for a little while.
---
Just to state, I have not played Eve in quite some time and have no interest but I still have a question.
---
Last it was left off, Eve could run on a simple type 2 VM, but only VMWare on Windows. Things have gotten a little looser, and people caught wind, so... Aside from the obvious "multicomputer", has anyone used ESXi (type 1 hypervisor) to run multiple OS instances and successfully run the game? If so, then the detection of Eve may need to be improved, as bare metal clients get their own IP and lack awareness of any other run clients, etc, etc... Also, it's bare metal, there is no performance penalty like the standard type 2 VM.
---
In my effort to run multiple OSes on 1 machine at once without type 2 VMs, this question came up...
---
Side note, running Windows and Linux at once without a VM, dual loaded kernels, it's great for a developer, it works well enough.
---
Fuck TRI... from BRO
---
I  make sure to welp 100m minimum on each char whenever I play. 
---
Yea, but the shit side if a strict definition is that it provides a line that some will forever try to overstep... just look at the corp market rules around blue fucking, and then number of scam sell orders that exist... 
---
In Brave, just as in life, only the offended party can define when they are offended... admittedly, I mostly play in late AUTZ, early EUTZ - so I miss a lot of the drama that goes on in main primetime, but I've only ever seen really new people fall afoul of the stay classy rule, since established players are well known and have a reputation upon which to refute the accusations... if you are accused and you explain yourself to the diplo guys, you get a second chance and you learn whats expected and build up a reputation... if you get accused and you decide to have a tantrum about it, then you get the boot, start a 'hate corp' and live in the HED-GP Fortizar, seething over how you 'git dun wrong'
---
Again, it may be rose color glasses because of when I play, but the only people I've seen kicked for not being classy were people who weren't classy... 
---

---
What kind of content would you find in null while multi-boxing a couple toons?
---
Also, finding content in J-space is no picnic.  A lot of scanning and...waiting.  Then if/when you find something--oops, they outnumber you 4 to 1.
---
Realistically your pvp would be ganking: explorers, epithals, gas huffers, and occasional miners/haulers.  Maybe verrry occasionally fighting some shit-tier low class corp that consists of five noobs.  No offense meant to those guys, but that's the reality of a lot of corps in low class holes.
---
You should prolly just consider putting some farm alts in your own hole and then put your mains in a real PVP corp.  Make your farmhole a c5-c5 or a c4 w/ a H900.  Having it in a c5 is nice because you can kill drifter boss w/ astrahus (almost double your isk w/ 5 minutes effort).  
---
Keep as few assets as possible in farmhole.  If evicted no biggie, an astrahut is like four or five c5 sites.
---
If you're new to the game you might want to train into Gila, Rattlesnake before any T2 ship.
---
Gila with RLML and Drones are really good for Abyss PvE, c3 c4 (~c5?) combatsites and all PvE encounters in lvl4 missions or DED sites / anomalie ratting in SOV null.
---
You can bring this ship into every region of space and be successfull, might need several different fits tho.
---
Shieldtank slotlayout is considered better for PvE since it combines Damage in lows with Shieldtank in your mids, thats more usefull than Armortanks wich need to fit their tank (and damage) into lows but have free mids to fill in PvP modules and all kinds of electronic warfare + tracking or capacitor.
---
Also Gilas have kind of lowskill requirements since their 500% Rolebonus alone boosts your dps enough to do some damage.
---
Doesn't CCP normally have a huge sale after new years every year?  Kinda felt like there shoulda been one this year...seemed like it was usually MCT-oriented
---
Yeah but he go afk after 18 months. I rather sit here in my 5 rorquals with big miner fc he never go afk Xd
---
If you can blitz them in 12min in T5 it's probably worth it, that being said if I take the price of the filament into account and you don't get lucky on loot, you can loose money running T4. I've really gotten sub 5 mil biocache on a regular base. So at 15-18mil a filament, it hurts rentability if you don't exploit all the loot.

I run my PI on 2 day extraction cycle and go to POCO once every 1-2 weeks.       
---
Usually forget to cycle the extraction. 
---
It is worth to me as it is afk isk.                
---
When i told someone about my approach he accused me of doing it in most unprofitable way ... as he extracts P0 and move it to production planets every day, sometimes twice a day ....
---
(Im middle management btw)
---
What do you run them with ? I don't really want to invest in another PvE ship considering how "little" I already use mine but if I ever loose it I'm curious.

for a second i hoped it was the german Techno group :(

The offended party being able to define when they are offended is fine. Does not mean they're being insulted. And the solution for being offended? It's the mute button in slack or the block button ingame. 
---
Granted ive been fairly aggressive in my posting on the subject here but part of the issue on slack is you cant dispute someone going "wah what your doing/saying is bad and u should stop" without being branded as unclassy regardless of how diplomatic you are.
---
90% of the time if something happens during a fleet or something it'll be the only thing the offended party talk about for the rest of the duration. The "rape cage" depot during UALX was the talk of the 6 or 7 people who found it insulting CONSTANTLY, when the option to not see it is to bloody right clock and hide from overview.

It's a lot more civilised... people actually wear pants these days.

Remove the corrupt people in charge who abuse and exploit every game mechanic like: fake support tickets for free afk rorq drone srp, the renting system which is filled with bots, abusive behavior towards line members who speak against them and don't play by their made up "rules", etc.

This. I did an internship in a open plan office. It was horrible. The constant noise was so annoying that i had to use earplugs to get anything done.

Keep on staying clean and strong. Don't let anything let you relapse. I've seen it destroy my own brother and it's not something I'd wish on anyone. 
---
Pretty sure we agree on everything you just listed. I was just pointing out one more person yelling about bots isn't going to do a damn thing, his whole platform from my point of view seems to be "I can do what everyone else was already doing but I'll do it 10 times better" Which is a pretty shit platform.
---
OMG you cannot be serious. The brigade alliance crying about brigading. Reeeeee
---
And I know several people who were going to give up the game until they tried omega and realized how much they were missing out on and are only still here because of the added benefits of being a subscriber. At the end of the day its all subjective BS until CCP releases actual paid V free player numbers.
---
and this is the point where the word Bot became the word of 2019... where everyone being "jealous" or just not smart enough will point at multiboxers shouting "bot bot bot bot bot" for no reason (ea. You cant run 10 vni's in one system, so you must be a bot... or you have 25 mack's sitting on a rorq, you must be a bot)... at some point there will be people pointing at bothunters shouting "bot bot bot bot"... because in oredr to catch a bot you need to become the bot.. bot bot bot bot bot... 
---
Everyone says it's worth it, but honestly I've yet to see something more boring than PI... It's unbelievable painful to me! --"

They did that open plan at a place I was at. New hired executive sold it to the upper management team, all the offices converted to this open concept garbage nobody likes or wants. Millions spent to do it. He quit or got fired on the end to only go somewhere else to inflict it on another company. Everyone has to wear headsets due to the noise and more people get sick cause of germs being sprayed on each other with no walls between anyone. Most anyone who can avoid being in the office works from home.

They detect VPNs primarily by looking at multiple users connecting from one IP, all of whom use multiple IPs (so as to not false-positive schools etc) and then banning that IP.
---
I've connected to Netflix many times using a VPN, as recently as today, and it only usually takes a couple of tries to find an unblocked IP.

And that's with Netflix's massive investment into this. CCP don't stand a chance of replicating this.

If you are a new Player i wouldnt recommand skipping Skill Time with rl money 
---
Or else you will end up like the Average  spoodbrain goon pilot in thier Rorqual's...
---
Invest the Time to learn the Mechanics better and improve your own Skills like PVP/Exploration etc.
---
Hey man. Kindly stop attacking content creators. Cuz we're sensitive and need to be coddled. 
---
some would say vni ratting is more boring
---
Yeah, fuck snuff!
---
Any skill worth taking is worth taking to level 4. Getting even the highest rank skills to 4 takes at most a couple days. Getting them to 5 is the hard part.
---
But the difference between 4 and 5 is usually 5%. Not that much. At most you only really need some spaceship command skills at 5 to unlock tech 2 ships, so youre really not missing out on that much.
---
Youll get there. 
---
Just do two totally separate transactions. Worked for me.
---
&gt; I can feel the frames dropping already.
---
That's the secret, it can't get less than 0 fps.
---
and then bubble ourselves... what could go wrong?
---
If you've specialised you  an do quite a lot with 7.6m sp. If your sp are all over the place it will be harder. I'd recommend deciding on a goal and working toward that, as you can still do some if it with lower so most likely.
---
that shouldnt be possible as your webs are in your midslots and not the highslots ;) so the heat from the webs doesnt have any influence on your guns. 
---
You have to use probes, to scan them down, they are no anomalies :P
---
I'd be totally cool with that if it were not so extreme.  I spend my time right now in null / WH space doing exploration... it doesn't take a year to learn all those little piloting skills you are referring to.
---
Even if I could fly those big boy ships I'd be playing smart and only taking out what I could afford to lose.  It would just be nice knowing that if in a month I had saved up enough ISK to get a Rattlesnake fitted and ready for C3 WH ratting I had that option.
---
If I stay on course I'd be ratting in null with a VNI roughly 2 months from now.  I can do it now but it isn't efficient.
---
I guess a better world is a happier world.
---
oh no you said something that offends me. i hope you get banned and censored for words
---
There is, at least for some people like me, a 'SP grind plateau'. Mine occured around 40-42m SP, after I trained into blops (a Redeemer). After that point, the urge to learn this and that and also that and perfect supports too, somehow went away. Since that it is hard to pick which unnecessary skill to train, which is also not a good feeling.
---
It might come earlier or later, but most likely there is one for you in the future too.
---
Also, I think it helps if you set one or more reasonable goals mid-grind, like, I have a lot to train but I want to fly a fairly good Sabre. You can spend weeks and months with a ship you like, while training up other skills.
---
Maybe you need a new alliance.
---
It's free ISK so the only question is whether you can be bothered with it or not. 
---
darkness renters in upper branch, they're dead now
---
-Find a way to make dank money ingame. I can almost guarantee whatever you're doing is probably worth 10x less an hour that the best activities (even those doable with whatever skillset smattering you have)
---
-buy tons of injectors
---
-???
---
-profit
---
Alot to learn you still have. Patience you need :]
---
But srsly ... with 7.5M you can get into alot of things, maybe just level 1 skills, but you can try them nontheless. At the end, if you are able to fly good with a ship, even lower skills can bring you some kills.
---
I fitted a dominix yesterday that i found floating in space, with meta modules, that i got from sites where i was ratting. :D that thing will probably die easy to alot of things, but might be still able to kill some stuff :) So no need to T2 everything, try something even if it might look like a fail in the beginning. :)
---
Do passive income methods. Especially reactions is super low SP requirement and great isk.
---
Do burner missions. Do PI. There are plenty of low SP income methods.
---
With regards to ship, you can do most doctrines without T2 guns, so training said doctrines shouldn't take all that long.
---
just throw few hundreds $ at CCP . EVE has PTW (Whatever) system nowdays
---
Yeah I'm down to one omega, not worth keeping the other 6 running.
---
I got this around 90mil when i had all t2 guns, all t2 ships, hacs and support ships and so on ... ready and no new doctrine was annoying to me.        
---
I know. As the downvotes show. We have ouchy feelings on r/eve
---
Like christmas
---
The worst thing about this video is watching a titan kill dictors like they are nothing. 
---
I do not desagree!
---
That's why I do it on a T1 Battleship... Fast, profitable, and actually somewhat enjoyable!
---
I know it can be frustrating but I always felt it's also part of the fun. When things come easy we often don't value them as much. I feel maybe you need to find a good crowd to roll with. With that your skills don't matter as much you will always have something to do that's satisfying ... When I started my Corp let me fly a salvaging catalyst in WH space and I had a lot of fun doing that and scouting. It even had a cloak and everything :p
---
Exploration tended to be a bit of a solo game but the skill requirements are also not that high. 
---
Haven't played in a while though maybe I'm wrong about everything but I feel like the people thing is always true :)
---
How are you training BS IV in a couple of days?
---
It's only TRI, get over it!
---
Anyway remember when invoking argumentum ad Goons, that Delve is as densely populated as High Sec, especially under the umbrella.  There's a lot of site contention (due to this density); the locals are unlikely to put up with botters there.  Outside of the umbrella it's a different story of course.  But again, if you take population density into account, I doubt Goons are any worse than any other group in Eve.  
---
Shoulda stayed down south and flew with Templis.
---
O.o but the option to pay is always there. I'd strongly argue the majority of those alphas who stuck around because they subbed would've never even got into eve if they needed to pay per month. We had a trial system in the past, but it was inferior to the current alpha model in terms of getting invested and knowing the game.  Regardless still stands, you remove alphas player numbers would dip quite heavily. 
---
Shame. Much shame. 
---
I do extraction to P2. Reset extractors once every 24 hours. I do pick ups once a week. I make enough to plex my account. Takes me 15 minutes to reset all my extractors on my 3 toons. All the isk I earn doing everything else is my free to spend isk.
---
Just like in real life, you can't be worried about what others are making. You have to make do with what you got. Right now, yes, that isn't really shit, but Eve is about long term growth, and long term investment. 
---
Keep filling your pockets here and there, look for passive income like PI and importing low stocked goods to your alliances trading station via JF. 
---
C3 daytripping can break the monotony of things. 
---
Another option you may not have looked at is Low Sec combat sites. Can be done easily in almost any ship.
---
I am 28m sp on one toon and decided to fit an Algos with probes, run through low sec, and was able to do a 4/10 in it. Even easier to do in a cruiser.
---
In my opinion, Null Sec sucks as a new player. Maybe if you're selling PLEX it's enjoyable? But for my part, it was a miserable experience (when I was low sp). The best experiences I had were always solo, doing my own thing, like running narcotics warehouses in a PvP fit hecate, and other such things.
---
Special treatment probably is being given because he's very visible.  You know, last year CCP did an "event" where they teleported bots into High Sec including Titans and Supers.  It was actually kind-of funny and a great way to give the issue a lot of publicity.  
---
Its not possible as you are correct. 
---
Are you using it for something like a 2D Astero retro game where you shoot herons? 
---
Start killing the astero bots roaming in your space and you might have some left over.
---
Shhhh, Brave doesn't have any supers.
---
Focus on enjoying what you can do and look forward to what will become available not complaining about the person born before you. It's like complaining about gravity
---
I've just joined Dreddit after a five year or so hiatus from the game, I've been a bit overwhelmed by all the different communication channels now available. Back when I were a lad you had Teamspeak, and mibbe a private forum, but most of your comms was handled ingame. Dreddit has so many things.
---
Brave shit... ya know, the kind that just refuses to go down.
---
Spai
---
They already have it coded.  They just push it back an update every time he asks for it.
---
Then apperantly i didnt stop the overheat at all :0 i thought i did
---
Ah I see their chat system devs are hitting the pool tables.
---
So what kind of ships do you actually want to fly. Because I doubt they are far away unless you want to get into T2 cruiser and above. And they usually have very low sp (and yes weaker) T1 counterparts. Also you seem to be tunneled I to 1 way to make isk. Through grinding bounties. This is definitely not the best way for a low SP character. Heck, not even the best for high SP characters. 
---
My scanning and exploration skills are shit (despite playing off and on for like 6+ years).
---
Last night I scanned down a C3 wh sof that popped in our Amarr FW staging home. Went inside, scanned the sites down and had 3 relic sites. Combined loot for those 3 sites was around 150 mil.
---
That's something you can do with an alpha account.
---
I still think the original newbie tutorial was the best.
---
"Here's a ship. Now fuck off!"
---
Before injectors and before alphas...  this was still the case. This game taught me much needed patience. Seems it might stand to help you. Everything in this day and age is instant grstifacation and that's what you're saying you want by being able to dodge the sp, with no cost which is one of the fundamental basis of the game. Maybe the games just not for you.
---
Very nice stuff
---
Do you want fake news, or do you want the Mar5hy ban on there?
---
I just returned myself to the game, i mostly watched videos and did some reading as I found that the seeker investigation wasn't amazingly helpful. I jumped into level 1 missions straight away and now am in nullsec ratting and solo pvp
---
Been in Brave for months, also on comms, never heard anything like that... Sure, sometimes people will tell you "please stay away from IRL politics" but I think that is pretty much everywhere since those arguments can get very heated.
---
Great for one-shotting those fifty-strength nodes. :feelsgoodman:
---
So much this.
---
We used to roam up that way all the time and you'd see the same all-same-name-with-a-number-on-the-end Ishtars with exactly the same ship name and fit, and they'd be online 16 hours/day like clockwork, always warping as soon as we appeared in Local.
---
There's also an area in Venal where botters are running Guristas missions with groups of pirate frigates. We caught a group of them and the pods, rather than make an attempt to leave and reship, warped to the site and sat there.

CCP, this is ruining the game, and it's caused by the fact that sites in Eve are methodical and thus easy to macro. Make the standard PvE experience more like abyssal sites with multiple rooms and unpredictable spawns; and I daresay it'd be much harder to set up a bot to run the sites (or infinitely parallelize AFK income, also shit for the game).
---
Bl have better reddit posters
---
I would of jizzed my pants if i'd been the titan pilot.  
---
11/10 Snuff bros
---
How about you try doing one thing well at first? With your SP count, that’s usually ceptors for fleet or small gang PVP, or T1 frigates for Solo PVP. If you’re into PVE, just skill into a VNI for 15m ticks.
---
If you don't like ratting in vni leave null and have some fun somewhere else.
---
I was a Goon spodbrain for some time and with quite few injectors. Now I'm enjoying highsec more than that. With basic gila fit and some skills in exploration you can go and hunt for hs escalations. A bit of scanning and a bit of fighting. And possibility of 300mil ded loot.
---
The same with l4 missions and abyssals and npc mining fleet hunting.
---
Bottom line try other things and find what will make you happy. Also a bit of diversity will help as you loose this rattle in c3 sooner or later and it's a good idea to have backup plan how to replace it.
---
I was in your corp when you stole everything from the then-current CEO, and then ran away to join a new alliance with your tail between your legs. Get a life you lying F1 monkey. 
---
Stop, I can only get so hard
---
I found that once you have the Basic skills done its a lot easier. Everything else is to specialise.
---
There is a reason you train caps/supers on an alt.
---
If you think forced memes are good sure.
---
Cloak a bomber or sabre in the site, and you should have no problem getting tackle. Then just warp in something for more dps if the bots fight back, or also have a cloaky t3c waiting to attack after the bot is tackled 
---
Join large nullsec block make 100mil/h+ while salvaging.
---
Don't limit yourself with small corps as beginner, all big coalitions are recruiting.
---
If you want to make Money join Goonswarm tho! *blatant shilling*
---
/u/joecuster idk what this shit means but i blame you for everyone saying it
---
&gt;  It's hard to be satisfied with making 10 million ISK per tick when you know it is possible to make so much more if only you had the SP to fit the proper ship(s) 
---
What are you doing? Flying Catalysts?   
---
Get a VNI, grind for some days, slowly work your way up to a Thanny (or Nid, w/e). A jew-fit on the thanny is like 150 mil per hour even with poor skills. Inject your isk into skills until you are there. Once you are there, it gets easier. 
---
Heat from mids can’t damage highs, are you sure? I always thought heat could. 
---
What are you going to do, camp sites with a ship scanner fitted and let people go only if they don’t have a cargo scanner on their ship? There’s no realistic way to stop this
---
Your problem is you keep thinking about all the cool things you could do that *aren't* what you're doing now if only you had the SP.  The truth is if you acquired that SP and did those things, you'd still feel exactly the same way about all the other things you could do if only you had even more SP.
---
Consider character training to be like a Marshmallow Test.   Do not look at or think about your SP or the skill you're currently training.  The skills will complete on their own, without much if any intervention.  
---
You know that says, a watched pot never boils?  It's like that with SP.  Stop thinking about it.
---
As you can see there are a lot of options on how you do this. Research and plan ahead before setting up shop the way that fits you best. Dont forget about logistics and your final products mass, that will shift your presumed efficiency. I also suggest only making to p2 or p4 due to better market liquidity on most items.
---
I know it from this video

That sounds pretty cool, PvP is not a hard pre-requisite and I can always do that on another char. I'll look them up and check them out, thanks.

That's good to know, I will shop around and hopefully find a good fit somewhere.

What are the SoE missions like, are they any special at all?

i think the point is that 90% of the people shit-talking elo are tapogon spodheads
---
I found it a bit overwhelming at first too but you get used to it pretty quick. The forums and the wiki are actually pretty useful. You don't really need auth after you get in, and that really just leaves you with mumble is discord. Jabber is just a backup and can be setup when you have the time. Give it a little time and it'll make sense. 
---
Bring back the space mines.
---
As a noob to Eve, why did Tri even fly in a single blob when the enemy has a titan with a doomsday capable of killing that entire blob with 1 shot? Why not spread out?
---
As a PLEX trader this makes me very happy indeed. I disagree with the entirety of this post.
---
and it doesn't even matter one bit that we suck at PvP, cause we got the numbers and the money and while you may win some fights with skill, you won't win the war with it. :P 
---
There is that. :)

Yeah I know that some people go kill bots all the tone but why is there not a universal alignment of everyone to go out and kill all bots. We could have a war on bots.
---
Alt tab at its finest
---
If you are enjoying exploring that keep doing that. Relic sites are huge money for low SP. You can rat sleeper sites up to C3 in a battle cruiser if that's what you want to be able to do. Hell I heard a passive Gila was a good option. Since Gila/Rattle is answer for all pve lol.  
---
Even with near perfect skills I didn't get the best ticks in null with a VNI and I HATED it. Are you having fun OP? Don't matter  if you got 10 or 100 million sp, if you ain't having some kind of fun you will burn out. 
---
What leads you to this projection?
---
I mean in 11 years from 2008 until now he has paused exactly from 2016 to the start of 2018, less than 2 years, around 15% of the time since he started. Lets just count how many Goons are really playing the game actively (not afk multiboxing roidkillers). I guess in that metric he is more active than the average goon linemember... 
---
But hey, I know you just wanted to post narrative driven dipshit. So i will not further bother you with facts ... o7
---
Wtf CCP don’t let this happen. We all knew gigx evaded ban by being mrs gigx. This needs to stop you need to enforce bot rules
---
the koolaid is strong with you

nice disclaimer

Hmm, all mar5hy says in that new discord screenie is true ... fite me

I think he may mean he was heating all the things, guns and tackle
---
Bose QC35-II are huge in Icelandic offices
---
Maybe he bots ...
---
waisting ya time Elo, join Grrgewns then you might have some success with this
---
both in WH and Null you will be constrained by the amount of P0 you can bring in. So to get the most profit you will have to do strip mining planets with 10 heads and only doing one p1 then export and have a factory planet with 2 x P1-P2 chains and a single P2-P3 chain. this could be robotics or any other P3 that only takes 2 inputs. another and easier option depending on your cost to get the stuff to market is to simply leave it at P2 and sell it as the step up from P2 to P3 is not that profitable in teams of raw cost but it does add compression so if you pay by m3 to get stuff shipped to market then it may make a lot of sense
---
or microsoft

What does is his arsehole taste like gimp?
---
We were absolutely shocked at the brutish and unprovoked nature of CVA's aggression. CVA's vaunted "NRDSI" lifestyle has been revealed as a sickening hypocrisy that threatens to rot their entire coalition from within. Thankfully these Australian good Samaritan's came to our aid when they did. 
---
The benefit is the ability to one shot 60 coherence 40 strength antivirus nodes. With a Frostline you still gotta pay attention but with the Zeugma it's actually harder to fail a hack than to succeed because you ca 1shot everything except firewalls (the most dangerous now), restoration nodes, and virus suppressors.
---
If you plan on throwing away the ship its on the frostline wins hands down. It's miles better than a lig and half as expensive even after the price went up than the zeug.
---
a decade at least
---
I'd be utterly shocked to find any student nowadays without at least a basic laptop.  It's pretty much a requirement, and in some programs it actually is.
---
Which means even a bare-bones PC can run Minecraft, and probably even World of Warcraft, EVE, or League of Legends.  Probably not well, but these games are designed to run on as wide as range of computers as possible, to reduce the barrier of entry.
---
When will we purge the Great Wildlands?
---

---
Cool story Bro.
---
i'd really like to write a pvp bot to hunt pve bots...
---
I checked your other posts, but am still unsure what exactly are you currently aiming for except that you're doing exploration and are now aiming for a VNI to rat in.  
---
You see, you're on a good course. To maximize the VNI ticks, you probably will be considering Gallente Cruisers V.  
---
From there all you need is Recons, which you will want to get to level V eventually as the bonuses are just sooo good. But you will be useful with a level IV as well.  
---
Since you're in the VNI, you probably already have something in the way of Shield skills and this puts you into Lachesis.  
---
From there if you get Minmatar Cruisers V, you can also fly in the Huginn. You can use both of those Recons in most fleet doctrines.  
---
So there you have a way to make some isk along with being useful in fleets. The training time is a bitch but you'll most likely be able to fly these two ships regardless of what doctrine is the current meta. Recons are kinda always there.  
---
And after you have that, you'll just keep building on top of it - since you already have these Cruisers V, you can slap in Heavy Assault Cruisers and Logistics. Amarr and Caldari Cruisers later to have it all. Every skill you train is opening many doors for you and those will stay opened forever.
---
A few suggestions:
---
* Avoid battleships and other large ships. They take a long time to train, they need large weapons, which also take a long time - it's probably not worth it in the first 2-3 years. Train small and a few medium (ship+weapons) stuff.
---
* A good tackler is not "lowly", but a very respected person. Especially if it's not in huge fleets, but you go on roams with a small to medium gang. If you manage to get first takle on stuff to kill for your friends, you are hero of the day.
---
* Other useful activities is scanning for bookmarks (especially in WH corps) and combat scanning (for warpins or combined with getting first takle).
---
* Try to train into a Gila. It's two cruiser skills, one medium weapon (medium drones) and one light weapon (light missiles) skill. Only the drones should be Lvl 5, for the rest 4 is completely acceptable. The Gila is a great PVE ship for generating income.
---
* Don't grind like crazy to buy injectors. It won't make a lot of a difference and burn you out. Best skillpoints for ISK is not injectors, but the cerebral accelerators from events. Not the "advanced" ones - they are always heavily overpriced. Standard accelerators are usually ok, the basic ones are very cheap and offer great value for a limited wallet. Try use these accelerators back to back while they are available (they have expiration dates, be careful to not hoard too many). You can use your Gila to farm them yourself during the events (and sell byproducts like the drugs or advanced accelerators for profit) or buy them from the market. 
---
I get around 500mil per run that lasts 2-3 hours in Sansha space.
---
How far along are we supposed to be on the Prophecies of Macaper? 
---
It’ll go by in no time, feel like I was just at 15m the last time I logged in on my main and just a few days ago it hit 100m
---
Do the best with what you have and fly with good friends and it won’t matter :) 
---
where can I sign this?
---
As if Iceland would need to ration that
---
I'd suggest this: get one racial frigate and cruiser skill to 5. Then get T2 small and medium weapons as appropriate to the types of ships you'll be flying. At that point a lot of T2 ships are very accessible. 
---
Lol at the harpy chain headshotting.
---
Please don't ask me to put more effort into the easy shitpost than Elo did with his campaign announcement.
---
I believe is pronounced "Brule Cory Stro"
---
&gt; important part of the game
---
So you speak of Skins ?
---
At ~60mil SP focused you can fly anything BC and down with full T2 fittings. 
---
you are far away from everything
---
eve online has one of the worst skill systems ever invented
---
dont do this op t2 cruisers are a meme under 20m sp

---
Couldn't agree more, but when you look at rorqs, VNIs, and anom spawn rates that seem designed around chaining, it's hard not to get the feeling that CCP disagrees (or at least did).
---
very cool!
---
So much for the "*Hard Knocks is dead*" meme...
---
I suggest you also do the career agent tutorial missions which you can also find from the Agency. They're pretty good and pay reasonably for very little effort. Free frigates, hauler, implants etc.

The video is a compilation of 3 different fights we had with legacy alliances in last 7 days. In a non-chronological order.
---
The first fight in the video was over an Astrahus that Brave anchored in Insmother. Then a fight over one of our Astrahuses in Y-FZ5N where they tried to rf it with harpy fleet and jackdaw fleet. And last is us trying to get something out of the FEEDUP staging fort.

Fly and fly are 2 different things, also add to this stuff that most people forget like rig skills - i have all V in those also.

My own program is very likely going to be discredited if change isn't done because it's becoming just a visa program for immigrants, due to our coordinator actually penalizing instructors who fail cheating immigrants. It's changed so much the first semester literally involves about [transitioning into Canadian culture ](https://i.imgur.com/XYNKQHS.png) now. This class was not available for non-immigrant students to take as an elective.

My friends and I feel like StainGuy except it's to change the program for the better. Everything we say to people in power just falls on deaf ears.

everyone except provi :)
---
TL;DR CCP has a game worth having customer service for. CIG has a tech demo and a bunch of jpegs.
---
I wouldn't say it is "The worst"... it's just very unfriendly towards new players.  I wish they could find a way to make actively playing the game increase skill gains.  
---
Something along the lines of an Elder Scrolls game where if you're using something your skill in using said ship and fittings being used in some small way contribute towards SP gain for the related skills.  Wouldn't even mind if that cut off at level 3 / 4 of a skill and the rest was completely timed based like it currently is.
---
So vi ratting makes 120m/h? What are you on? OP sad 1b in 1hours which is good
---
everyone except provi-bloc
---
I've had that same idea before, those were long before my time but I'd love to see something like that again, hell even player built gate guns would be kinda cool
---
I feel like you're underestimating 60mil. At 60mil I was usually top DPS with all rig skills at 4 and some of the "nice to have" DPS skills at 5. 
---
Good riddance.
---
Uh, there was a post on reddit a while back, but TIKLE has the most Supers and Titans per person out of all of legacy.
---
So these numbers are somewhat skewed
---
They are dead. Just takes a while for everyone to catch on and move on. Some people are more stubborn than others,

&gt;you should ask him to help you with some transportation issues that you might be having.

&gt;Remove plex, problem solved

yea if u think eve online still having a running server is a problem
---
Would that make Wangs alts of Olds alts?
---
The KOS checker isn't working atm for never entries I believe...so yeah

I need to play devils advocate here.  There are a lot of skills that require level 5 to fly nearly any ship effectively (cap stable).

Heavy Drones Operation V - 24 DAYS
---
Can you rat in null with a VNI with T1 drones? Sure you can... but it is painfully slow and the ISK isn't anything to write home about.
---
That is just one skill required for a VNI fitting and it's nearly a month to train.
---
Nice 
---
Notes: 
---
* Sisters of EvE Ships have been omitted, due to being Amarr/Gallente and not fitting into the tidy circle 
---
* Navy Issue Ships have been omitted since they are boring. (Outline on an Apoc Navy is like the outline on an Apoc vOv)
---
* Gallente has way too much good faction stuff. FNC, VNI, and 5 pirate lines versus 3 for Minmatar, Caldari, and Amarr.

How to get your fleet bosoned off the grid (Tutorial 1/1)
---
The rules of Provi are pretty clear on this subject:
---
&gt;No pilot, corporation or alliance shall anchor a station or outpost without the express permission of the constellation’s Administrator
---
[https://www.cva-eve.org/rules-of-providence/](https://www.cva-eve.org/rules-of-providence/)
---
Youre not doing any of that as a new player.
---
I think you miss the difference of main vs focused char.    
---
Tbh i stopped carrying about SP when i was over 120mil and trained for over a year on bad revmap ignoring implants - so don't get me wrong.     
---
In those 90mil i assume : all cruisers V, useful BS V, all T2 subcapital guns, all support skill (including rigging), recons V, hic V, dictor IV (tbh ... it is dead any way), DST/blockade runner(like you need those) and stuff like Cyno V , pos gunner skills or stuff anchoring for T2 lage bubbles.         
---
Like i stated - this was the moment when i assumed char finished in terms of "basic skills for main"     
---
For sure a lot of wasted SP as this is main ... as i started in higsec  or lived in WH so trained some related skills. 
---
Well, I guess one way of getting tactical supremacy is to have the biggest stick.
---
I’ve spent the past 8 years playing this game with no breaks and I’m at about 160mil sp. Technically someone with enough isk could inject up to that amount instantly - is it fair, maybe not, but eve always used to be about the grind and that was part of the lure....but alas now it’s pay to win. Either way dry your eyes mate, you sound like a moaning millennial.
---
You will be back.  You've spent a decade here.   In a bit of time the call of Eve will be answered.    Good luck to you!
---
I have the feeling that is exactly what would happen.
---
Market now open for business to the general public. We plan to stock it with small gang PVP essentials to make the already accessible content in Providence easier to enjoy. 
---
Capitalist Army is recruiting :3
---
Time zone wars dosent really create good content. 
---
Set this this shit for a weekend so there would have been proper fight out of it.
---
Would have been more fun for everyone involved, including tickle.
---
Provi lost some caps, allready replaced. 
---
"Something"  
---
Like when? What? How?  
---
Next week? Next month? Next year?
---
Can i join?
---
On a more or less same note 
---
I tackler a praxis with my solo/small gang loki
---
It was shield tank and armor tank
---
However is shield+armor tank regen was more than my dps so i had to call friends to finish it xD

Sad but true.
---
That machariel in the beginning that escaped the boson, he was scooting his heart out and warped out right as the bubble went up. I applaud him.
---
Shame is steal money from corporation, Patrick.
---
You use faction heavies jabroski, I’m 27mil and I still haven’t bothered training it to V because it just isn’t all that necessary. 
---
It's pretty clear on the rules
---
&gt;No pilot, corporation or alliance shall initiate an attack against another unless that pilot, corporation or alliance is expressly wanted on the Deliverance KOS List
---
Honestly I think that botting should be encouraged and local chat removed from every system. I think dropping deep into an alliance controlled space to take out the money makers is pretty fun. Also bots are basically just NPCs anyway.. 
---
Is that what they did?
---
I resubbed after a few years break, my carrier and other combat ships had been stored in a station in Provi. On returning I expected to
---
a) Be able to get my stuff.
---
b) Have to join the new station owning entity to get my stuff.
---
Instead I got a bill for 300M and all my stuff's in lowsec!
---
Took me a couple of weeks casual play to recoup the cost, but I'd like to understand better what the hell happened.
---

Do you approve of this 'Black Market' Trade Fortizar in 9UY?
---
Actually, noticed that all my pind windows move even with a single click-drag.  Whats the point of pin then?
---
It's not the game that need fixing it's your attitude. I started playing in may 2018 which is almost 8 months ago and I'm at 100m SP spread over 3 toons and after I've come this far I realize that you can participate in 80% of sub content with 10-12m specialized skilling.
---
It's about setting a goal and being adamant about it and don't bend over for the uphills you will meet. We all broke our backs on those Hills and once you are on the top you realize that your journey is a great part of the being sucked into eve.
---
I mostly only fly pirate frigs and rely on my friends who already have millions of specialization SP to kill whatever my frig catch. It is a team oriented game and any effort to do that differently is going to be exponentially harder, so go out there and find people on your own wavelength and the skills won't even matter.
---
If you're a good guy with great attitude people will also help you tons with isk and provide you content.
---
Nice
---
Generally you don't spread yourself out in fleet fights as that allows your guys to be picked off. You stay close to each other (and the FC) so that the fleet can respond as a whole to anything that attacks it. As for why TRI would warp a fleet onto a titan at all... who knows.
---
He should train Post Calibration to V
---
Yes . And they were added to the KOS list long before this fight, after they were caught breaking the rule I quoted.
---
I am running 6 accounts with 6 planets on each account. I have 30 factory planets and am spread out over several systems. It is rare when I have more than one character in a single system, so no competition between toons.
---
Haha holy shit what a complete meltdown
---
Sorry for playing in our timezone, fighting dudes in our timezone.
---
Next time I'll make sure to run fleets at 3am Australian time on a Sunday.
---
paging [https://www.reddit.com/user/caprisunkraftfoods](https://www.reddit.com/user/caprisunkraftfoods) to explain why this should be a thing (because it was hilarious last time he attempted it)
---
Psychology.
---
Citadels are neither stations, nor outposts though, so the rule you quoted doesn't apply. 
---
Not as much as you would think. By profession I am a mathematician, so I am treating this as an extended exercise in efficiency study.
---
What game is he working on?
---
you have to click a box in the settings, so that pinned windows stay where they are. under general settings
---
Thanks very much!
---
Citadels are neither stations, nor outposts.
---
No rules were broken here.
---
Never a problem. Glad to help.
---
Just hold me close and call me pretty. I'm a content creator. 
---
You got weekends  don't you ?
---
Anchor one in Stain please
---
Very nice work
---
It breaks my heart to downvote you but I'm going to do it anyway.
---
Microsoft did a U turn, they're open-sourcing their stuff on GitHub like crazy.
---
God forbid they let someone fight back..
---
Settings in general settings, lock windows when pinned.  Assuming you aren't talking about some new bug.
---
It's also a good marketing move - you come to the F2P game and decide to sub later. I'm an example of this, I would probably never have started with the game if it was subscription only.
---
What kind of mindless advice is this? General consensus is capital saturation is breaking the game and then here we go, more players suggesting newbros get into carriers which are some of the least flavor diverse ships in game? 
---
F
---
The F keys work regardless is you have the textbox selected. you can use some of them for things that are important.
---
I only ever use the first 4 for modules, scram web prop guns. so the rest are free to be rebound to worry-free mashing.
---
With the main difference that you are doing literally nothing for VNI ratting.  
---
Warp, launch drones, orbit, open everything and come back after 25-35 minutes to do it again.
---
it honestly was... certainly much more then the senseless structure grind and cit spam we have nowadays
---
....its seems like , someone don't like Ammar Empire :(

Daily reminder that the arrowofapollo is still a garbage fc

See standings screenshot, good reason im playing POE and not Diablo 3 :p
---
You can literally train no ship higher than a T3C and still be one of the most useful pilots in a fleet. Links claymore? Web huginn? Web loki? Links legion? All extremely useful and will get you more girls than flying logi
---
thank you!  why that wasn't on be default, idk.  
---
The wall space in and around where the art team sits is the coolest part of the office for sure.
---
Don't do it. You will get pouched as soon as you take that lowsec gate. Dominix can only kill afk targets or someone stupid enough to try fight you and fly straight into your neuts.
---
Hence why i screenshot the standings, to prove they were not KOS when provi aggressed
---
grinding SP shouldn't be in your focus, thats the grave mistake many players make. Grinding SP never ends, regardless of how much you have; even after 10+ years of eve there are plenty skills to finish, its a neverending story, you really shouldn't pay subscription fees for that.
---
Set smaller goals to yourself, focus on what you can do right now and have fun with that while you're training for the next bigger thing on your agenda.
---
You can't fight shitposting with shitposting, and this was a really shit post. 
---
Actually, that's not the same thing.
---
They are asking for a tool that *literally prevents their account from allowing their skillpoints to be extracted.*
---
You're giving them a tool that *increases the difficulty of successfully infiltrating their account.*
---
They're completely different.
---
I`m at 100m and I haven't trained heavy 5
---
Second this. 100m in and lm still strictly a frig whore.
---
Also missing triglavian
---
Untrue. CCP made Citadels direct successors to outposts when they replaced them all with Fortizars, which comfortably makes them fit within the definitions used.
---
Imagine... Being THAT in to a tech demo...
---
Navy ships arent boring, but would be difficult to add due to the nature of the actual advantage of using them, not being purely bonus's.
---
Typo in Barghest and Ashimmu
---
Require bot-like reflexes for all PVE activities to lower the use of bots? This is not going to work.

All drones go to a haven?

---
I don't know when you took that screenshot, but they were KOS when this fight went down. EQ (the one who is ultimately the final word on who makes it onto the KOS list) called for this action days ago, when it became clear the deployment was not in error and the offender would not comply with Provi rules on the matter.
---
Absolute pleasure doing business with you.
---
Basically
---
5 pirate ships use Gallente
---
3 pirate ships use caldari
---
3 pirate ships use minmatar
---
3 pirate ships use amarr
---
needed: 3 added pirate ship lines, one for cal/min, cal/amarr, min/amarr
---
Shame is not having revenant for feed.
---
Don't insult someone lmao, yeah we are talking about eve here, insults are a core part of the game.In most corps if you do something stupid , you will be called out,maybe in a bad way, but the goal is to learn from it , not to insult you
---
Thought about it, but those have their own skill tree, just like the ORE ships do, so they are their own circle, so to speak. 
---
Scourge = Skill U pets now?
---
following accusations that Provi shoots entities listed as not KOS, CVA IT team quickly amends an entry, 
---
TIKLE = Bad Guy Evil Capital Blobbers
---
Provi = Good Guy NRDS Bois
---
Narrative fixed guys, it's all good!
---
Skill extractor. Focus on 1 race and weapon system.
---
I always misspell those. Is it 2m's or 2u's? 
---
Gaara was bold and STILL took ages to get banned, while presumably input broadcasting the entire time. The premise that "it's not used for rorqs" is oblivious at best
---
how is that amarr came on top?
---
Sure they will but they're not discontinuing AoE2HD at the same time.
---
No plans for Stain expansion :(
---
I can get behind this.
---
It isn't, didn't fit around the circle, sorry. 
---
Holy shit, that looks like a lot of bullshit. Sorry to hear you have to deal with that :/ Guess my own uni isn't that bad after all.
---
Is this going to be a provi take over? That would be really inconvenient for me 
---
We always knew they were funded by bots, but actual being bots themselves?
---
Actually now that I'm thinking about it, it makes sense.
---
many of us have families, and as such don't play in the middle of the day on a weekend... Especially in summer... I mean it was 46 degrees last weekend, my laptop would melt if i tried to play video games in that heat, and I'd prob die of heat stroke or some shit..
---
their skill system is probably the reason why this game still exists after 15 years on market, while other games died 3 times in same period of time. Long term goals are major part of player motivation.
---
Maxing out the VNI skills was a bad idea for me. Sure, the ticks are maybe 5% better than an average pilot, but you might as well upgrade from the VNI at that point.
---
What this really feels like, is that you don’t have enough SP to make decent isk to do what you want (cheap pvp).
---
Join an alliance like Pandemic / Imperium / whatever floats your boat. And go salvage the sites their guys farm. All you need is a destroyer and some salvaging gear and you can make some incredible isk no almost no SP.
---
Black legion dud ill let you know you misidentified that number hes 5339 im 5334.
---
But Stain have expansion plans :)
---
Because I fly Amarr. #Bias
---
Is the market going to be open to Proviblock members? Asking for a friend
---
Just shoot all the relic hunters? No prejudice 
---
Ok
---
:popcorn: i hope this keeps going good memer here.
---
Ofc you do, at least it was fair answer. 
---
Ok, I was too lazy to trace outlines for all the different navy ships. You got me. 
---
50mil so with several ALTs at 20+ mil sp none with heavies 5
---
I imagine his thought process was something akin to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92gP2J0CUjc)
---
Well there are a lot of bugs especially in wh space. Personally, i dont think this is exploit because it has same risks to get cauth as for example nestor+rattle c5 farming. Also that method gives you no advantage in isk/hour before other methods. It has preparing stage(roll, making a bookmark 400 km, dropping traktor and etc) which can also eat a lot of time. After preparing stage (if u have "all 5" needed skills andhu have 1,5 kkk ship) u will able to farm 200kk/h, but it will be the most boring hour in your life. And while u fatming u need to pray that no one will roll to u, if they do so then your farming over and u get nothing.
---
Summary, u need to invest decent amount of isks and sp's to get boring farming method which has pretty low isk/h per window, and which has same risks as all other farms. I dont see any advantages by using this "glitch", althogh i think there are very small amount of people that will choose this method of farming.
---
Well if ccp will decide that its a glitch, they'll just increase agro range in some patch.
---
If you don't come to stain, stain come to you 
---
Pretty sure the weather isn't only warm on the weekends,  while the rest if the week is colder :p
---
Anyways, if you deploy something to get a good fight out of it. Make it a weekend timer,  then there might be a few more euros aka  targets online.
---
If you just wanna min max it then do it on a weekday . 
---
Whatever is of  course within  your right in  a sandbox game. 
---
so high skill f1 pressing is a thing. very cool video, ty for sharing
---
The other way around. Scourge was the mastermind all along and skill urself just doing what they're told to do.
---
Just buy 10 tech 1 frigs and fits, go lose em. Don't worry about sp. Once them dead buy 10 more. Rinse repeat. 
---
Sp is secondary to understanding the game and having some skill.
---
I'm having a little of that at 50m sp, just got skirmish specialization 5 and now I don't know what I want to get next
---
get a real job brisc. you suck.
---
What did they do that's noteworthy?
---
Fuck me, my goal to reach 1k killmarks on nightmare is gone..... why did i read this.... 
---
(best try so far 468) :( 
---
Was 18 degrees and drizzly today, so yeah it is colder the rest of the week, straya is fucked 
---
the rest of the week we would play in our tz, which for most people is evening, and it's much cooler than midday
---
Skill urself are known hackers and cheaters but CCP protects them so there is nothing that can be done about it. 
---
I guess you became illiterate I dunno
---
Honestly this is the most underrated comment on reddit. 
---
do people even use the barghest? Rip BS with tackle bonus
---
Waiting for the sun to keep the memories of reading the stars, the sun gave me the following flight of escape in the fog.I am beginning to understand that the sun offers an empty goal. Their stars will be empty after empty dreams. You can get away with truths, vague language at work without the sun.
---
Speak truth to power about the movement. I would also like to know the choir, for my dictatorship springs onto a tasteless project within the wisdom.
---
no i disagree, this is fun to watch
---
https://i.imgur.com/EzyTmYx.jpg
---
shiter urself picking on newbie alliances that can't fight back then bragging about it on reddit. taking a page out of your non 4chan counter part, rote kapelle. i see...... 
---
been too long without attention? 
---
That won’t discourage people from cherry picking cans, which is the problem you were talking about 
---
But as a newish player you should not be worried about getting perfect ticks in a VNI in null. There are a tonne of ways to make isk in this game the dont require a huge amount of skill especially if you are living in null and taking part in big fleets. 
---
When I started we used to loot the field after big fights, run sites in groups, run scams and any number of other ways to make isk. 
---
Dont focus on being able to do everything perfectly straight away, do things scrappily and have fun learning all the ways you can do that. 
---
Tu quoque, random white knight
---
EoM for Amarr/Caldari pls CCP. 
---
obviously place SoE shipsin the middle they are the best fucking spaceships fucking ever
---
EoM for Amarr/Caldari pls kthnx CCP. 
---
Stitch does
---
but no, generally people do not use the barghest

You could always just spend a few hundred dollars on skill injectors, and then promptly burn out because you found out that the game doesn't hold anything interesting even once you can do things.
---
The entire situation at this school makes me so heated. 
---
Why do people keep accusing goons of mass RMT and botting? I so far have not seen any rock hard evidence of these characters botting or this character RMTing, just a grr gons hat gons kneejerk reaction?
---
Simply a question
---
It is missing half the ships?
---
&gt; in a month I had saved up enough ISK to get a Rattlesnake fitted and ready for C3 WH ratting I had that option.
---
The thing about Eve is that if you really want to do one thing and focus on it you can do it with surprisingly little training time. I used to multibox a pair of rattlesnakes in a C5. The characters were focused skill plans and had a little more than 4m SP.
---
Especially on PVE ships it doesn't really matter if your skills only allow you to unlock 90% of the fit's performance. Maybe you'll take a minute or two longer to clear a site, but that's not a big deal. And if you get caught, the extra 10% won't save you.
---
I know back in 2016-17 i ran with an character with an Arabic name and got invited quite a few times  to a channel that was solely for Arabic speakers like they wrote in Arabic in the chat.

I had a long comment somewhere documenting all the differnt traits they could try out, but I do think that there should be a second covert ops pirate line if possible / lore friendly (frig would be a bomber equivalent, not sure about a cruiser, and the battleship should get a nichce slot of being the only bs to fit a covert cloak, unless when in testing its determined to be too op)
---
After the ecm changes I dont want an ecm line, unless there are heavy bonuses for other parts of the fit.
---
Are you talking about yourself in the third person?
---
the only ships that aren't carriers that are arguably better at null anom pve than vnis are gilas and ishtars, and maybe ravens or rattlesnakes if you're into dying to dread spawns
---
none of those is really worth the extra training time as a new player imo

Well, automation has made /some/ progress during the last 20years. The times are over, when bots were not able to do anything but send a fixed sequence of keys in fixed intervals. They can read screens and interpret graphics. If you can make a decision within a few seconds, this can be be automated.

Explo bots are an advanced show of capabilities, bringing many parts together - a simple rule based "AI" to solve the minigame, a graphics tool to do the scanning, scripted traveling and rules to avoid and or escape players.
---
I'm afraid there is no "fix", certainly not an easy one. Every kind of grindy PVE is vulnerable to botting. In games where assets can be transfered from one player to the other, there is also a possibility for RMT and thus an incentive to develop, use and proliferate these bots.
---
The only way to go is the hard one -- try to police the game. Find as many bots as possible. Take them out, but most importantly, hit those hard, who received the fruits of the botting - the RMT customers or the mains of those who botted for themselves. It is like fighting crime in real life: You can lower it to a level, which is bearable. But you can not eliminate it, and you will never reach a point where you can say: "That's fine now, move on to something else."

Thukker is T2 ships (Jag, Panther, Jump Freighter, other ships which sound like cats)
---
They aren't even close to newbie alliances. The coalition they make up is the current #2 coalition and owns vast amounts of space. If they own the space and have the structures they should be able to defend them. 
---
Someone  mwd straight to me in one just after I warped in.. leaving his drones behind. Is that the type of bot behavior or do you think that was a gamble that I would bolt? (I did, my little had no rep or extender; All a gamble on being alone)
---
your message got twisted by saying what the community doesn't want :(
---
Seems fairly expensive for exploring, like bucking up for a Nestor, then sweating every failed hack.
---
dumping plex you have
---
Use faction drones, the difference between II and faction is actually quite small. Obviously you haven't researched this enough.
---
I've been playing actively for the last 6 or 7 months, I have 3 accounts, 1 with a pilot at 16m sp, 1 at 12m and my "main" at 13m, the 2 alts were characters I started in 2013 and played for a short amount of time before quitting at around 5m sp due to  lack of interest at the time.
---
One of those alts can fly exploration ships very well, and since coming back he has also trained logi cruisers to 5, the other alt was making some decent ISK at around 8m sp, flying in hisec incursion fleets, really doesn't take too long to be in a battleship that will work for an incursion community like warp to me, and they are great for learning general fleet mechanics in a low risk environment (they even SRP for FC / logi mistakes), this pilot is now my fleet doctrine BS pilot,
---
My main is essentially in destroyers, mostly sabres, flycatchers and jackdaws, he has been training for bigger ship skills for the last month though, since my secret Santa gift was some fun BS platforms I'm keen to lose in a fiery ball of death
---
I have 1 additional money making alt at 5m sp that sits in an afk VNI, my primary income comes from this pilot and occasionally the main who also sits in a VNI, I also dabble in market trading, seeding faction  consumables in null (ammo, probes, cap boosters, drones, etc)
---
This supplements most of my pvp needs, with my current assets sitting at 2 fleet basis, a fleet nightmare, and almost a bil in frigs &amp; dessies
---
I think the key is finding others to play this game with, they will help you figure out how to make ISK, and how to find content, and how to fly your ships, which will hopefully lead to you better understanding how to fit available ships to your available needs with your available funds 
---
A shame is getting a revenant by botting
---
Its so nice to see the grumpy old man approving of his Trans-Muninn lifestyle
---
Ill vote for you just for posts like this. 
---
skillu and scourge are frat pets
---
i'd take a 5m SP but EXPERIENCED slasher tackler over another 100m SP PVE F1 monkey any day! what you think is "lowly" or "cheap" is one of the most important roles in fleet warfare

You spend more effort in your anti delve-bot campaign than BL in their delve campaign 
---
Let's not forget that we had almost all of our dictors (in the harpy fleet, 1st time we reffed the astra) bubbling our own fleet. FC asked for bubbles between the harpies and the enemy muninms, they started bubbling the whole fleet.
---
they only added it after a massive outcry in this SUB... if only we had a focus group with players from all areas of the game..

If the only way to defend yourself is by having 3+ alts, played the game for X amount of years and have spies seeded in each entity of interest then I fucked guy

Typical bots with standard warp away when local jumps in, dock and wait. auto reject convo, Lossmails on days where local got borked, all 2 weeks old..... 
---
I Reached out to ladyscarlet who has been pretty damn good at taking care of them, but after removal, they will most likely extract or move to another renter farm.
---
All toons and video logs were sent to CCP.  
---
Once again, I think a few simple things like delaying local by 90 seconds or until invulnerable breaks would be awesome.
---
i missed ur videos this is blessed
---
thanks
---
C3 ratting takes 230 days to get into? hmmmmmm you can literally C3 rat in a Praxis with super low sp. You should look into that. Highslots are 6x Arbelest RHML 1, Midslots Pith B-Type X-Large Shield Booster, large cap battery, 2 adaptive Invulnerability field II, Stalwart Particle Field Magnifier, Phased Scoped Target Painter and a Omnidirectional Tracking Link and for lowslots a Damage Control, 2x Drone Damage Amplifiers, 4 Capacitor Flux Coils. Rigs are 3x Large Capacitor Control Circuit. It was something like that, you should play around with this fit if you cannot fit everything or if you don't have fitting room. If I recall correctly this fit is a little bit more than 200 million isk which is a lot cheaper than a Rattlesnake
---
"campaign". I don't think that word means what you think it means.
---
There's ships which use Amarr, Gallente, Minmatar, or Caldari racial ship skills. There is pirate ships which use a mix of two of these. Triglavian hulls use the Precursor racial skill, and there is no hulls that use both. So not on the circle. 
---

Good grief that was quite the mistake by the TRI FC.
---
On the other hand this video (the first part, anyway) really highlights how silly bosons are. An expensive faction battleship fleet can go from perfectly fine to completely wiped in twenty seconds through no real fault of their FC and no real skill of the titan pilot. It saddens my subcapital heart.
---
Thanks, I forgot it was just Amarr hulls but not armor tank. 
---
In a week. Where you need to be proactive. Vni you start the script once a day that's it.
---
The dream. 
---
Yeah I kind of wish instead of the current targeting "picture" there was a live "picture in picture" feed of the ship you're locked onto.
---
The only way no. But I mean even brave has been flexing dropping supers on anything that gets close. My point was they have the funds, they have the numbers and they have experienced fcs they can defend themselves. 
---
NIGGA HE JUST WROTE IT
---
Tri-Tank best tank
---
We are coming.
---
The confessor and the astero are both quite powerful ships for someone with limited SP and ISK. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you need to rush into a bigger ship. 99% of the time a well flown and trained frig or destroyer is more useful than a poorly trained battleship. C13 wormholes are your friend here, as are data and relic sites. You'll get a lot of good kills if you're any good with an astero, and it doesn't take much SP to fly at all.
---
This is what happens when people forget that Eve is a game. It’s not isk per hour That matters but rather fun per hour that counts. Killing people in frigs is Intrinsically the same As killing people in capitals. Hell the game for me used to be a lot more fun when I had 2 million Sp and no isk. If I lost a ship then, it was a big deal, thus making killing things much more exciting Then it is now when everything is throw away and replaced the next day. 
---
As for making isk You have to ask yourself why do you need it. If it is just to replace ships that you lost then you don’t need all that much isk when you’re just starting out.  On the other hand if you were trying to Plex your account well then Eve has just become a second job for youAnd of course you’re going to hate the grind. 
---
I was and am completely ambivalent on the subject.  Truth be told, I was hoping CVA would find the balls to undock it's super fleet for once and try its hardest.
---
This endorsement substantially increases the odds that I will vote for Elo Knight.
---
Brisc Rubal wants to know your current destination ...

&gt; Anyone structure bashing ~~in sniping frigates~~ deserves it

Yup

But those idiots didn’t even take a single system in their grand delve crusade!

Heh, was commenting on my inability to spell "Ashimmu", "Barghest", or "Missiles" for that matter. Always spell them Ashimuu, Bargheest and Missles. 
---
And still wrong on the Barghest.
---
Really? Ask CCP to check ma man.
---
Saarus, never think that you are so silly. You can believe in holiness of Saint Patrick, but he provided documents to Alliance leadership, that I got 6 bil for the wyvern. But at the same time he said to me, that I can't get this subsidy because I bought wyvern before program was introduced. Where are this 6 bil gone?
---
Where gone QUAM moonmine goo, that was stored on CPA accounts?
---
Just a week before VIBE joined SKILLU, I had conversation with Patrick.
---
Me: Pat, I don't know where to join, MCAEL is leaving for NC., and I don't want to leave TRI. Can I join VIBE, because MCAEL said that you are leaving for SKILLU.
---
CPA: I never heard that VIBE will join SKILLU.
---
A week later, in the middle of the war of TRI and SKILLU VIBE join SKILLU.
---
Really, what was the reason to lie to old corpmate? 
---
SO you know, one of the reason I not join VIBE? I don't wan liar CEO. 
---
Perfect, I will add this to the database. Appreciate the support.
---
Appreciate your support on this campaign.

You don't know how big of a smile shit like this puts on my face. GG.

Yes, but only if it is bot free
---
BL is dumb and it upsets me greatly! Upvotes to the left
---
Makes it seem so balanced. Nicely done.
---
Brave aren't the target here. Immensea alliances living on the border are the target. Skill U are well known personal pets of Daddy Noraus, and have been dispatched to soften the border for the Serenity Mk.II invasion. RMT wins again
---
Yup. Before I subbed for the first time, one of my corp mates told me about exploration. I fitted a Heron and went to Catch.
---
Got about 400mil total in exploration loot. Spent like 2-3 hours a day scanning.
---
Welcome to EVE 2k19, where you need bots to fight bots ... all is good
---
This will quickly become a meme. I anticipate threads such as "Day 4 of Elo Knight's...oh wait he burned out".
---
what you gonna do, bluetral them?
---
This could be amazing - imagine yourself 2nd day of the 1st summit with Elo.        
---
He comes in to room, looks at every one and say ....          
---
&gt; This is boring. See you next year.          
---
You know what you can fly with that much SP? A Sabre. I bet you're less than a months training away from a sabre. 8.5 days roughly on remap from minmatar destroyer 5, ~14 days for Propulsion Jamming 5, and less than a days training for the rest. I don't know what your wallet looks like right now but just a couple of injectors would put you most of the way there.
---
There is almost no fleet or FC anywhere in the current year of EVE Online who would not be happy to have a smart person flying a dictor. You are truly meaningful tackle (I.e. your job really matters when you do it right and its not just suicide like you might have told flying meta 0 frigates), you can scout, you can save your fleet with drag bubbles, you can demolish interceptors, on the side of the main fight, and most of all you'll learn so much more because you're independently flying your ship instead of just pressing F1.
---
Grinding injectors is unfortunately the current meta of EVE Online, but it's awfui and you're under no obligation to play the game that way. If you go down the dictor road and just get really good at that, I promise in 6 months even though you'll have a much smaller wallet, less SP and won't be able to fly all the bigger ships than if you'd spent that time grinding injectors, but I promise you'll have had way more fun and be way less bitter about the game.
---
5 years ago when I started playing, bittervets were people who'd been playing for 2 or 3 years and had a couple of characters and maybe 50-60m SP on their main. They were bitter because they'd played the game for a long time. Today those people still exist, but now they've got way more characters, an order of magnitude more assets, and they've only been playing for a year and they're bitter because they never actually learned how to do anything but make money.
---
But why?            
---
He comes in to room, looks at everyone and say ....          
---
In all fairness, I was referring to my main. He has some skills outside of subcap PVP, but not many. What little he had when I came back to the game was quickly cleaned up with skill extractors. At nearly 70mil, I'm pretty much just focusing on the "nice to haves" now.
---
So you have proof he was in jail, or you just shiptoasting?
---
Relying on downtime to anchor, relying on a super cap umbrella in an off tz, , bringing 20 titans to a grid you lost, do you do any thing honorably? 
---
F***, forgot the H. Too lazy to fix now. 
---
I warp my Ishtar away when a neut jumps into local
---
I dock and wait (usually dock and go to another character)
---
I auto-reject convo
---
I am not nor have I ever botted.
---
This is normal non-bot behaviour believe it or not.  You need to include some more evidence additional to this that a bot is controlling the account.
---
To be fair, I spend more effort taking a fat ogre shit than their Delve campaign spent. The bar is not high.
---
I wish just posting topics like this got rid of the bots in this game.
---
JDC 5 would like to have a word with you.
---
Are you complaining you can't do everything? That you can't do it perfectly? Honestly, I was flying a heron in j-space as a 3m sp alpha and having fun with occasional small gang roams,  killing fellow explorers, and earning around 70m an hour on a normal day. Eve is what you make of it, if your highest goal is VNI ratting then you are going to get bored. Other people are having more fun not because of how much sp they have but because of how they use it.
---
Social Experiment? That's a lofty term for forgetting to turn off your input broadcasting.
---
Here we see the full goonswarm intellect in effect.
---
Ive seen it mentioned. But to reiterate. Your additude is wrong man sp and isk is just the means to an end. If your grinding for isk and worrying about ships you cant fly your playing the game wrong and you have to change your mind set.
---
Even in pvp skills mean little. Player skill and knowing how to fly your ship is FAR more important than any skill in the game.
---
If your worried about making isk your probably in highsec.. Move to null or wh. Whs do take more sp and general knowledge tho.
---
DAY ONE OF ELO KNIGHT NOT BEING REDDIT BANNED.
---
yeah basically. They added skill injectors so everyone could fly them, then they made rorquals a capital mining ship and everyone used those injectors to train up huge fleets of them to build the supers.
---
anyone got the battle report on this?
---
1 rorqual got out but we killed a thanny, classic...
---
tringle ship strong
---
The thing is that most posters aren't so much interested in the actual problem, as they are the leverage it allows in conversation for achieving tangential goals. It's a pretty despicable way of trying to affect change.

I was wondering if my sight was failing me because I wasn't seeing the purple dictors in the middle of all this :p

I know that u wanted to bring a character to bot with into our alt corp, unfortunatly the conversation happened on discord so i know ccp wont do shit. 
---
And im sorry to break ur heart but u got veto'ed from joining the corp because of that. (By me btw)
---
You're more rp weeb than anyone in cva
---
They are the only few CSMs who actually cares about the Wormhole space. Other CSMs only cares about null sec

umm I see probing and bombing on alts too

This is incomplete due to the fact you omitted ships. Make a bigger circle, add them in, and your  neat thing you got going so I can pin that shit in my discord. tia BD

If you don't mind: I would really like the photoshop file. This kinda inspired me to make some kind of 2D eve game :D

STFU and just kill them ... FFS

They did warp them out once. Then back

yea, i didn't mean specifically him, it's obvious he does more than that. but the fleet setting in general, using heat, switching ammo regularly, free firing and actually killing shit in time, etc.
---
&gt; heck

Please watch your language, this is a children's game.

Gonna be ez win and a much needed boost to the morale of the legacy line member after the northern deployment that didn't go so well.
---
Uh oh lost the obj and the isk war. Better play the honorable fight card
---
:npcmad:
---
Hey, you could at least be proud we don't think you guys are just some alliance stuck in north doing PVE all the day and friendly skirmish time to time, with this """"fake"""" campaign, you can at least pretend you do pvp 
---
nice
---
Space bushido is serious business obviously. 
---
Faction &amp; Pirate. I was mostly interested in showing the racial skill interactions for pirate hulls on this graphic, not showing the entire ship tree. After all, its obvious that a Tristan is going to be based on Gallente Frigate. Might do a more 'complete' version someday, but i feel it'd get cramped, given that each empire has 6 frigates, 2 destroyers, 4 cruisers, 3 battlecruisers, and 3 battleships, not counting tech 2 and faction.  
---
You know what they say -- cursing is for ineloquent motherfuckers.
---
On it.
---
Appreciate the support, fuck botters
---
Just curious. But why do some thinn Brisc has done a bad job? I haven't seen any news of him leaking etc
---
Frankly, I doubt BL cares what you think.
---
So what is stopping the Immensea alliances from having a proper Capital/Supercapital fleet that would be supplemented by the rest legacy? The only supers I ever see in Immensea are the ratting ones dead on Zkill.
---
that's what I thought, yeah. taken from eveuni: Whilst modules are active and overheating, they, and other modules in the *same section*, will take heat damage.
---
I do PI in a wormhole on a single character. I do 7 day extractions, but I usually restart it every day or two. I make organic mortar applicators, a P4 product, from start to finish, which nets me about 750 million a month. If I optimized it I could probably approach a billion, but that's too much work.
---
I wait for a good connection and do my own hauling, so there's very little overhead. 
---
Here's a link to EVE's Facebook talking about how many boots they've banned. In reality I think they're just advertising the new ship skins.

elo is trying to throw us off the scent, he is secretly the botting king
---
/r/eve is sov to take and hold control of
---
&gt; Any skill worth taking is worth taking to level 4.
---
There are a few edge cases where this is not true (*Deep Core Mining*, *Jump Portal Activation* and *Fleet Command* to name some), but those are the rare exceptions.
---
&gt; But the difference between 4 and 5 is usually 5%.
---
T2 guns/modules are *massive*, and the actual reason to train skills to 5.
---
Cal/Amarr is Sansha. Caldari is the AB bonus, Amarr is tracking
---
I said usually. Am i the only one who actually the OP? Ffs.
---
that is probably giving him too much credit
---
he probably has human-operated rorqual alts in delve
---
The northern deployment went amazing... we took the high sec markets, we dropped a ks, we made them turtle in one little region at the very top of the map, all of their offensive action stopped.. everything about the north was a win and we did it without supers.
---
Absolutely nothing minus actual skilled pilots to use them? I'm just confused why you project that alliances other than TEST and Brave asked for this situation for being anything other than Blue? Like every single entity in the game that exists, we are all propped up by someone. So no need to get upset when someone doesn't align with your narrative. 
---
didnt leaked something outside of imperium and also he is talking like a kiddie on our alliance discord. so.. #KickBrisc
---
that would explain their train wreck of a delve deployment :thinking:
---
Are we able to build caps in there?
---
Honestly, I really liked the video though. :)
---
Yeah you probably shouldn't get that close to esoteria...
---
Brisc Rubal only talks about himself in the third person when he’s writing press releases.  
---
The most important thing in Eve is finding out what you like doing for fun, and then doing it.  Don't put so much pressure on yourself to grind ISK, that you turn the game into a job.  That's the fastest way to burn yourself out and stop playing.
---
Find some people you like flying with, that like the same things you do, and do them together.  As a group, one pilot's skillpoints matter less than when you're flying by yourself.  This can help mitigate some of your self imposed pressure over your skill level.  
---
Don't let the fact, that someone with higher skills could do something more efficiently, stop you from doing something you find fun.  Just like in life, there's always going to be someone better at it in Eve.  You can't dwell on that to the point where you stop having fun.  
---
Come and see.
---
Ahahah, bring this. 
---
You can say anything in discord. The point is that to say is not equal to do. Some day you should learn it. But it looks that not soon.
---
Good thing to know for you, that CCP both has transactions history, where I buy plexes and transfer history how I get ISK.
---
So all other things is just a huge trolling.  But you are to slow to understand this. And all you do - you go to reddit to bring some shit.
---
The difference is that Patrick steal assets from Quam corp. Steal subsidy from Quam members. Tried to steal Quam ticker. Lying about VIBE not join skill. This is the FACT. And what you bring is just crap. You can say that I'm botter 100500 times, but money at all of my accounts are from PLEX sale, which I bought from CCP. As well as all my 7 accounts is payed buy credit card. Very strange for botter, did you ever think?
---
I just like seeing you post everyday. It's like .... a warm feeling.
---
Not really.
---
It's still entirely valid to point out to all of the goon koolaid posters that they are following a person who has done worse things than whatever they are currently brigading.
---
Many things about default EVE settings suck. This is one of them (it is off by default).
---
&gt;If so, then the detection of Eve may need to be improved, as bare metal clients get their own IP and lack awareness of any other run clients
---
Multiboxing is generally legal in Eve.  
---
The only thing one couldn't do is multiple Alpha accounts at once, but that is to limit certain use cases of massive numbers of Alpha accounts.  Working around that limitation with VMs or additional physical computers is onerous enough that people are not going to reach the use cases CCP was concerned about.
---
I trained marauders 5 just for lols 
---
Oh. I think I misunderstood vily's message then. Onwards to victory! Those skillu shitlers won't even know what hit them before they're out of legacy space.

Elo has RMT trillions to support his cocaine addiction and to pay his bills when he was jobless, hes openly admitted this on mumble. Why isnt he banned? Hes now just seeking all of this attention because his alliance is irrelevant and he needs more isk to RMT.
---
Plot twist, Elo is using a bot to make these posts.
---
It all comes down to one thing: do you enjoy that part of the game.
---
I have 23m and I feel like a complete newbro that can only scan and fly frigates effectively and some t1 stuff without great efficiency
---
Auth never sent me a confirmation email when I made an account (unless it's manually sent and hasn't been gotten to yet). I take it there's a Dreddit pub channel in game where I might get help?
---
you mean goons are coming
---
It’s a Freeport, why kick out your customers? They’re just breaking up the monopoly by bringing the items directly to you!
---
People like OP is why the game is where it’s at now. Why the fuck would you think it’s ok to be on the same playing field as someone that has dedicated years into playing this game? I don’t understand. With 7m SP  you are able to do something that will make you a lot of isk at least one thing. Whether it’s l4 missions, exploration, ded sites. Shit you can even fly an Exhumer and join a nullbear Corp to get rorq boosts. But to wanna be able to fly a supercarrier right off the back is stupid 
---
60 mil is 3 years of playing, what the hell are you on about.
---
This is just good conversation not upset at all. Nobody asks for a fight unless they are the aggressor which they are not in this situation. Also I agree blues are necessary and should be utilized which I'm sure they will be as legacy reinforces thier eastern borders. Those alliances are not new though they have plenty of older skilled pilots who are cap/super cap capable. 
---
&gt;As an added bonus, that same weekend is when Toronto hosts its annual Pride (gay pride) weekend so LGBT EVE players might find themselves having no shortage of things to do

I'M SHOCKED, this is in no way was planned on that weekend because Falcon wanted to attend this....

Huh? So, we pushed them as hard as we could without supers. Period. We gave it our absolute best shot ... they had Titans and Supers and we didn't. We could not crack their defensive turtle. After the welp the next logical step was for all of us to move Supers in range and demolish them, which we could have done but it would have taken quite a bit of time (months). That was not something Vily or Progod was willing to do. That message was exactly what it said ... chill out, we are not going to escalate, we have other things to do.
---
&gt; Added Marauders because I forgot about them
---
That’s ok so has ccp
---
Oof

Goodbye and let people fly safe in real life o7

I agree that it does not take much intelligence to observe a partial-birth abortion of a campaign.
---
is Horde coming?
---
My face when someone tries to shame me by going through my post history 😂. Reach harder lmao.
---
&gt;Mexalon and noxcium are the main minerals I am lacking even when target arkanor and dark ochre
---
These are not the best sources of mexalon or nocxium.  Gnesis for mexalon, crockite for nocxium.
---
Do a "show info" on the ore/asteroid to see what it refines to, and chose the one that has the most units of the material you are looking for.
---
As for buy vs mine, you have to remember the minerals you mine still have value.  If you can't make a profit buying the ore/minerals on the market, don't just mine the minerals instead.  You are losing money if you do.
---
You can make a profit on some BCs and BSes.  Just not all of them, so choose wisely.
---
All weapon systems and supports to 5, all cruisers (including recons/logistics etc) and battleships to 5. Except caldari battleship, nobody needs that.
---
Just focus on core skills for, so when you get into bigger ships your core skills are good. Trust me these are the most important skills to get up to 4 &amp; 5 first.
---
 If you want to be able to ship up, focus on a orthrus, osprey/caracal navy issue to inject into.  Bring the space ship command skills for them to 4. Then light missles to 5, and specialization to 4. Make sure you can use faction drones, and perhaps inject minny cruiser to 4 and you can fly a scyfi too.
---
That should cover one large and I think 2 small injectors.
---
Frigate to V takes under a week, and opens up so many doors. Interceptors both get your explo loot safely to Jita and let you be tackle in any small gang. Assault frigates are very powerful, pretty inexpensive, and insurance is excellent; between the AF frig and the associated small weapon system, it takes very little time to get these close to max damage/tank. Instead of using a VNI to rat, just hunt your neighbors' VNIs - a halfway decent Ishkur, Hawk, or Enyo (in the north) or Wolf or Jaguar (in the south) can comfortably kill anything cruiser sized plus ratting carriers' fighters (if they're the right damage type).
---
&gt; The truth is if you acquired that SP and did those things, you'd still feel exactly the same way about all the other things you could do if only you had even more SP.
---
/thread
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
With now 85 million skill points, looking back at the time I had around the amount you have... I honestly don't know how I managed to stay for so long to amass all this SP! lol
---
It's definitely a grind/ exercise in patience that I would not do a second time! --"
---
But after years playing... A 2-3 years long "retirement" from Eve, I am now back and able to enjoy a lot of shit that I never thought I would when I started playing! lol
---
Be patient Capsuler!
---
The thing about EVE and it's rather unique approach to "Veteran status" is that in this game you can know that YOU WILL GET THERE and WHEN that will be.
---
Just join with a bunch of stupid people that make sticking around worth it and enjoy the journey to get to where you aim for o7
---
Favorite ship! Great job :) 
---
/u/StainGuy is a bot btw
---
Hehe
---
@everyone whoever u/Its_mandatory is on reddit please pm me thanks
---
So u telling me Pat should have told u that we join skill a week before we actually do it, because the rest of tri wont totaly be bothered by this.
---
Also, u already applied the charakter to our alt corp.
---
And im totally happy to exchange some screenshots with u. how about this:

i even talked to your old corp mates about this

---
and i was pretty fkn reasonable tbh
---
You can do solo but it's a ton of work. If you're down though go for it. If you're looking for wormhole fights as well as Nullsec do a c2 with static c5/ns. If you want to focus on kspace fights either a c2/c6/ns Or a c3/ns. If you want mates coming in after and for them to be able to support themselves in hole then c2/ns/c5, with good planets for pi in the home hole would be the best.
---
When it comes to solo krabbing you're safer in a c3, and your isk/hour/ship in space is higher than tinkers in a c5, but your total income is pretty limited. You'll have more available with tinkers in a c5, but you'll want at least 4 accounts then, the 2 rattles and a scout for both the c5 static and your home hole.
---
Hope you have fun, jspace really is an awesome place to live :)
---
XIX fc’s having to communicate in 2 different languages o7
---
What about doing your PI whilst VNI ratting, its the worst of both worlds!
---
Not at the moment, but so far they've been at the end of a quarter.  So there might be some in March.....though I'm extrapolating from a sample of one.
---
Wargod and Taylor04 will always be the FC's for me
---
Faction Drones are just a small % worse than T2 in damage and significantly better than T2 in survivability.
---
Remember your competition is probably refining in a T2 rigged Tarata in null, and manufacturing in a T2 rigged EC in null.  So if you're comparing the build costs in an NPC station, you're going to start out a ways behind.
---
(Leshaks are more likely to be built locally, the others are small enough to easily move)
---
It is now.
---
yea its not the worst anymore because its made massive gains, i meant the concept from the start
---
there used to be no skill injectors, before you could train an actual skill you needed to train lengthy "learning skills", you couldnt have a skill queue so you'd need to decide between setting an alarm clock to pop in a new skill or training a skill you dont want as much just because its longer, and unless you bought pod insurance you lost sp upon being podded
---
liked and subscribed 
---
Bring your supers then. But everyone in eve knows you won't unless papa goons are holding your hand. Why say shit you'll never follow through on?
---
Fucking perfect for this artwork. We really need some sort of side-scrolling pixel game haha
---
ok retard
---
if it's not it will be
---
If you're running relic sites and you see combats the hunter is a bad, unless the site literally just despawned, in which case youre either going to the next one Or back to the Wormhole, either way standard scan probes are more useful. Sometimes people don't warp if they see cores on dscan, but they almost always warp for combats if they're even half paying attention.
---
If course, if you end up in our chain all the relic and data sites are already bookmarked for corp. Have fuuuun! ;)
---
&gt;Appreciate your support on this campaign.

afk mining =/= botting
---
triglavian are a new race and not a faction/pirate line, hence the entirely new racial skills
---
There are 2x gal/min and 2x gal/amarr, creating another of a factoin combo thats already been created (assuming not including gallente) just helps balance what currently exists.
---
It shouldn't be only 2/7 pirate faction ships do not require gallente, that's just strange.

Now thats an older CSM tag you dont see often...

As Elo knights personal Reddit posting secretary , I can confirm that Elo will be standing for this years CSM elections 
---
Also negotiations have taken place between Brisc Rubal and Elo Knight  in which we can now  confirm that Black legion and The Initiative will be deploying to Deklein to reclaim the holy lands of the north in the aim to hand VFK back to The mittani , after being paid two faction fortizars by Faffer of Test alliance 
---
For more information please feel free to contact Elo Knight in game via mail 
---
hey CCP, how about some Mordus legion love? its been... 4 years atleast 
---
counterpoint: thanks for the hurf blurf on your tweets and then UALX happening
---
When I don’t anchor Elo puts me over his knee and gently spanks my bottom and I enjoy that a lot
---
Good thing, that you bring it here. 
---
I was wondering when it will be here. So let's CCP to check my chars.
---
And next time, when somebody will tell "I want to join your corp to bot" you may think that guy is joking, spying or do other thing you don't know, instead of "HE IS DUMB".
---
I have very interesting screenshots from my dialogs with CPA. But I prefer wait for him :)
---
False. I haven't seen any evidence of /u/Alekseyev spamming local with Amarrian scripture like that one dude...

I believe this used to be owned by Da Imbalance, so they literally shot their own keepstar??
---
it was my fault tho, i could have warped out but pressed the button way too fucking slow. gf i will TRI again, i guess. 
---
ayy lets make a reddit thread to get ccp to check someone for botting ... genius.
---
and ofc now its all a joke...
---
I know the feeling of not being able to fly a lot of ships, having about the same skillpoints as you currently do, but trust me fun is never limited to skillpoints. It may seem like *months* of training to get into nice ships, but with level 4 core skills for ships, drones and support skills (engineering skills in general *should* be about 4/5 for easier fitting), there's a lot of fun to be had flying T1 ships and the occasional T2 ship.
---
Specialize your skillqueue into a certain ship type/2 ship races, so you can train into ships a lot easier (by having the relevant support skills), and avoid skill injectors as much as possible, they may seem like a fast way of skilling up but they take so much isk you most likely wont be having fun grinding for the isk (and they don't speed up your skill queue as much as you may think).
---
Never try to think about flying every ship in the game, nail it down to a 2 ship races and larger ships/smaller ships, depending of which you like to fly the most. You can broaden your skill queue once those are done and enjoy the game in the meantime.

C2 with any HS static if you find an empty one
---
It's not like the rules really matter anyway, because provi just adds anyone they want to shoot to the KOS list on a whim.
---
Happened to myself twice so far, neither corp ever engaged in any PVP in Provi or against Provi entities. 
---
One time, *one* member had his hauling ship scouted through provi space by a red (the scout didn't even aggress anyone on the way), which was enough to set the entire corp red.
---
The other time their diplos said something along the lines of "we don't discuss reasons, you know what you did". It definitely wasn't anything that ended with any killmail evidence on our corp kills.
---
I guess when you're looking for content you just take any reason you can get.
---
Hypocrites.
---
It doesn't take a year to learn all those skills, it takes far longer. Even some of the best pilots in Eve still have things to learn about piloting.
---
They meant you are missing ships. 
---
There are more navy ships, and there is another faction that is left off completely Sisters Of Eve. 
---
There also several faction capitals.

Then pay wingspan or eve scouts to find it for you

Thats fair, but does that not go for most of CSM? I'm guessing he goes to meetings as do the rest but, why specificly call out Brisc?
---
Thanks, im glad.
---
I see no listing of Administrators on the rules chart therefore he must not exist. Eq hasn't role played enough in the last several years to remotely call himself High Magistrate therefore the rule must not apply. Time to update the page to include Citadels.

They are pretty good in pulsar brawls
---
If you want to make isk running sites solo, go to a c3. If you want easy logistics, with a hs static. More PvP focused, lowsec or null static. 
---
If you want to be more kspace PvP focused and don't care about pve, with a dash of wormhole content thrown in, then a c2 with null or low statics.
---
If you want to focus on wormhole PvP then a c4 with static c4/c5. 
---
If you want to bear up and make a boatload of isk throw some dreads in a c5

hrm, skill tree for ORE is not as nice and straight as it is for the pirate ships, which have a frigate, a cruiser,  and a battleship. Also, this might be racist, but all the mining barges look the same to me. Like a Retreiver is just a long Procurer. Could do something on yield and tank basis, but mining doesn't really interest me much. I mean except Rorquals, which look pimpin'. 
---
I am sure when the hordes come you all will feed 45b or more in capitals on a bi-daily basis. 
---
That explains why people keep breaking anchor.
---
I imagine someone sitting in some deep mining shaft yelling "YOU CANT EVICT US COWARDS!"
---
I don't want to post my screens right now. If you add me in discord I can share it with you.

At this screens everything looks much more logic that in what you just linked :)

So if I got it right, you're saying that he talks big about himself while having done nothing?
---
same
---
You're right. Any decent skill plan would throw you over 200 days.
---
Eve is not a game you can really play until you're 50-70 million SP anyway.
---
And don't listen to those trashes who have their SP as a replacement for player skill, all-skills-to-4 character doesn't stand a single chances against all-skills-to-5.

UAGs are content creation alts. Find out yourselves from who ;-P
---
I do not see any other CSM post that much content-less stuff on reddit.
---
Why don't you disable local in the region with the highest number of banned botters for a month? See how that goes.
---
Whack the worst region every month, see how long it takes for nullbears to take care of the problem themselves. 
---
You're putting the cart before the horse, having goals is fine but there are \*always\* lower SP ways to do things.  
---
Take C3 WH sites for example, sure you can do them solo in a Rattlesnake which is a pretty big SP investment. Or you can get 2 other people and run them in Myrmidons which takes maybe a week to get into from a new character. PvP is the same way, in every kind of fleet there are lower SP mainline ships that work for the designated role.  
---
Basically you just have to find a group that supports newer players and has those options available to you.
---
It gets just a tad suspicious when you dscan 5-6 vni's, there's tons of navy wasps/praetors on dscan and then in 1 magical tick they all magically disappear and the vni's all go to the same pos. Meanwhile, it's abundantly obvious that it's the same "person" given the joint date on the corp/creation date of the character are almost always the same.
---
Shout out to Doom, never start caring if Vily thinks your blobbing and keep evicting TEST.  You can do it kiddo!

We know. Incursions have been a thing for years. 
---
Da Imbalance had a bad breakup with some members, said individuals took control of the KS and many other structures. UAG considered hostile to area so Da Imbalance + friends have been purging UAG from area. Todays keepstar was just about the last of the cleanup.
---
Have you installed attribute implants for the characteristics that are pertinent to the skills you are training? I shaved two days off of a two-week cycle with a basic "Memory" implant. Much cheaper than skill injectors and the drop in time gives me some semblance of a "light at the end of the tunnel".
---
I'm aware of that you mong, that's why I said *malicious cheating*.  The "accident" theory is perfectly plausible and I would argue unworthy of a ban since it hurts no one.  CCP is essentially asking us to take their word for it that he did something that actually gave him an advantage, which is not worth a lot for the reasons I mentioned above.  Maybe he was cheating, maybe not, I'm just saying neither party is particularly credible without evidence.
---
Ah yes, the old Elo said it so it must be wrong. :eyeroll:
---
I was not aware he posts stuff on reddit. Whats his username so I can check them out?
---
PGL did get that big capital brawl that he wanted as well. 
---
Decided to  go subcap only, and as noted, the SoE don't fit snugly, since they're Amarr/Gallente, which puts them kind of awkwardly in the middle of the circle, so they were left out. And most Navy Issue ships use the same base model  as the ship, except for the included firetail, slicer, hookbill, and comet. I was originally only going to do pirate ships, but decided that those 4 were special enough to be included. Plus there's a lot of navy isse ships, and I've been hand tracing these. 
---
How? I'm at 82mil and have all Frigate/Destroyer/Cruiser/Logi all gun types/sizes, and all subsystems to 5. The only things I don't have at the moment are 3/4 of the BC skills and all 4 BS skills to 5. But 20mil SP would do all that + MarauderV and then some.
---
fucking retard htp blobbing our sov, killing our ratters, htp never ever fight honorably

Thank you for this useful information.

So of someone wants to anchor a structure in provi , then do it in your main TZ , so you can max CTA? So you don’t cry on reddit how unfair that is ?

No one cares for Provi except for Provi

I give him mad props for even attempting it without supers. If it would have been successful, it would have been epic.

Isn’t that fortizar in your CYNOJAMMED SUPER STAGING.
---
You guys just don’t have the balls to fly anything bigger than a carrier. I guess the people that invested 25-30bil  in supers are real happy that they can use them
---
OP talked about ratting. Carrier ratting is the logical path if you like that type of play.

Get out of here with the "don't play the game in a way I disagree with" crap.

Nice video! You got into some really nice fights there, and I really do like how you conveyed your thoughts and what was going on in the video. I do think that the video would be nicer if it was slowed down though, sometimes it's hard to see what's going on and the messages on the screen because of the sheer speed of the video.
---
Drop Nightmares on Eagles and HACs on Harpies. I am not exactly sure what part is worthwhile making a video over it. It is pretty dumb to take the engagement and a massive mistake, but geez, let's not start chest beating over it. 
---
Reee someone who likes to converse! I would say alliances like Skill U/ Scourge don't operate like a traditional alliance set up. Everything is done through alts (Dictors, subcaps, capitals, supers) whilst most alliances wouldn't have anywhere near this level of structure. On top of plenty of spies seeded into them, which means 100% engagement on their terms. I can't see a way out for these guys other than through bringing Papi home or content denial 
---
Shout out to the whole TEST-leadership for let me have the best time of my EVE-life :) 
---
You have to understand that this game really isn't even about skill points - it's about skill. I remember a dude who injected 4 rorqual pilots and a Hel pilot and sat all 5 at a belt mining, until he got repeatedly dunked on and had no idea how to respond or what to do. Learn the game - pick some cool ships you like to aim for, and just play.
---
They converted all those npc stations to upwell faction citadel's so people went around killing em off and unanchoring them. You can fly across null and only see an NPC station once. I came back to the same thing and it's pretty sad. I liked the npc stations. 
---
Fair point fellow capsuleer
---
I've never felt so loved
---
Yup, it gives you the rewards again too. Yay, free skill points!

Staying somewhere farther out of the city along the GO lakeshore train route may be a cheap option for people as well. GO trains run until like midnight or 1am if I'm not mistaken.

Can't wait for this!
---
Ok, no sarcasm, full-serious for just a second: 
---
I'm legit impressed by the sheer industrial/financial might of TEST that you can throw that many dreads out there and the reaction is "Oh well."

What would be crippling for a lot of alliances is a minor speed-bump to TEST.

Why? I met a lot of people in those 10+ years and only like 1% of them plexed accounts, majority payd cash, more convinient, less time consuming and you can do whatever you want without being forced to krab. But indeed situation changed with all the alpha shizznat that came from various shitholes thinkin eve is precisely what they were looking for. Not to mention the very same shitlords trying to bruteforce things that worked for years out of the game because /eveishardandunfair.

Caldari; have the highest base cargo in their tiers, but no specialisations.

Minmatar; have the most agile industrials, however at the expense of cargo hold.

And when it's going up, it's up. And when it's going down, it's down. And when it's only halfway up, it's neither up nor down. Seriously though, you'll need a trading strategy. If I am selling a small block of items and the competition is selling large blocks, I will undercut the competition by 1 or 2 percent when setting the order, (big sets don't like to move much). If I'm selling a big block and my competition is selling a small one, I will .01 isk them (or just let them sell out first). You can also set 2 orders on the same item and try to lead the other sellers by the nose down to a lower price, say 10-15% below fair value, and just buy em out. 
---
Just FYI, I did watch the Vegas videos, all of them. So you got a few things wrong. Very wrong. While they did say that the leshak is too strong in DPS and that will be addressed, they **also** said that the Demavik and Vedmaks is underpowered and underutilized, especially the Demavik, the Vedmak, just a bit.
---
And as for your Drek comment ... they said nothing about the Drek being balanced, unbalanced or anything, when Vegas was going on Drekavacs were not in the game yet, not even on Sisi, so there were no comemnts on it being overpowered or anything because no one in the game has ever used it.
---
The only thing that will get toned down is maybe, and that is a maybe Leshak DPS unless they decide to leave it as is in part due to cap vs sub-cap imbalance.
---
The thing that they did end up doing after Vegas, is moving one low slot to middle on the Demavik, which did jack shit for it and its still jsut as bad as it was. then they came back and said that they know the Demavik is sub-par quite a lot but that they don't know what role to fit it into, where / how to buff it.
---
So don't spew bullshit, especially don't bring up stuff like vegas and claim that they were talking about ships getting nerfed because they are too OP when those ships aren't even in the game yet at that time.
---
A number of reasons really.  To RMT you have to have an in game method of making a lot of isk - and there are few who contest that the group that is best at making isk is goons.  As far as botting, goons seem to make most of their isk mining and this is a practice that is relatively easy to automate.  
---
However, I think the _primary_ reason that people assume that these breaches of EULA occur in goons is simply the prevalence of these offenses within the community and the relative size of goons.  Unless goons has a robust mechanism for weeding out botters and RMTers (which I do not think they do based on previous statements discouraging reporting of suspicious activity), then goons likely contain a good number of offenders simply because they contain such a large portion of the community in general 
---
Excluding battleships and some missiles-

All weapons to 5, all cruisers excluding some t2s, all frigates and all dessies. Recons to 5 is my current queue :)

Never mind the nit-pickers, this is super pretty and a very helpful reference for newbies like me. Thanks for the effort!

Oh boy I can't wait for day 4

If that happened, you’d have people setting up bot corps to try and rent from their enemy’s and get them banned. 
---
100mn at 4km/s with a sig of 60 (assuming your running sig boost)

Standard light missile (255/30) has a 12% application   
---
60% web drops it to 1600, bringing it up to 32% application  
---
2x 60% web drops it to 770,  meaning 66% application from light missile  
---
Our caracal fit is 347/21 has 24% base application  
---
1 web hits 62% application, 2nd hits 100%
---
Ah, from the alliances on the killmail, I was wondering if anyone actually defended it.

I think it's funny when people show "evidence" of botting. Yeah we can assume that's what it is but, plot twist you are not 100% sure and so you cannot say without a doubt that someone is because that would be a lie! Let CCP handle it, stop crying wolf, if you suspect someone report it to CCP and let them investigate. This witch Hunt won't get anyone anywhere 😂
---
Thank you for the great information! 
---
I have some very serious beef with CCP for nerfing the Proteus to the ground like they did. IMHO both the offensive sub systems need a big ass buff. Drone one needs simply have a 5th heavy out, instead of just 4 to be competetive, the blaster / rail one needs more PG reduction for blasters / rails and either bit more tracking or optimal to give it more fitting freedom. I used to love the Proteus.
---
Other rail / blaster ships need some love too. Deimos in particular I think.

CSM doesn't mean anything. So I endorse a dead.mooses ass.for CSM

Thanks mate. I fear that no one watch the fights when they last to long the speed is around 200 to 250. But next time I slow them down you kinda right

I generally agree that true Rorq bots would be unlikely (broadcasting is another story), but implementing a priority list of what to mine would be trivial by comparison to everything else.

I wasn't sure but looked anyways - [https://zkillboard.com/character/202138874/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/character/202138874/losses/) dude has lost the monst titans in game to date , why would anyone give him access to anything ?
---
This. Every time I've set up a goal to fly some amazing ship, and finally achieve it, the thrill was underwhelming and the novelty wore off way faster than I thought it would. Especially if it was a krabbing ship. Lasting satisfaction comes from leading a sustainable existence and enjoying what you have right now.
---
How big is this fleet anyways? Will no corp stand up to the robot horde and punish the bitblooded metaldicks?

&gt;abusive behavior towards line members who speak against them and don't play by their made up "rules"
---
I think you picked up a wrong game the, eve is unique in one way, people can do whatever fuck they want without giving two shits whether someone likes it or not. There are no rules except eula. Everyone should burn it into memory cells. Dont like something? Feel free to get the fuck out anytime without anyone missing you. Thats a simple rule which was valid since the servers came live.
---
Huh? You are cherry picking these very particular metrics and then claiming that is what deems it a success. We could not get enough armor supers to bring a good fight to your entire super fleet, correct. You guys already forgetting about the 10 Titans lost?

It's actually kind of depressing to me how many people in that video (including the Rifter pilot himself) are no longer with CCP.
---
For a while, they did.... 
---
you say that like it's a bad thing
---
If you are really wanting to get into a certain type of ship, or do something specific. Focus your queue on getting those skills to V, and leave it alone. During events use as many boosters as you can. When you get to V on most of the skills associated with what you are  wanting to do, it's easier and more fun. Also using a remap (to get rid of charisma points as I never use that) and plugging in cerebral implants will help, train up cybernetics(implants) and biology(boosters) to V asap to really get the skill points flowing. 
---
People like you are dumb. OBVIOUSLY there is more, but this behavior is not what normal and suspect.  Things like warping 7 batting toons at the exact same time, and warping off at the exact same time to 7 unique anomolies, not responding to local chat, kill reports/lossmails, toon age being less than 2 weeks, being in a renter corp, or recently kicked from another renter corp for discovered botting, running sites for a full 23 hours, etc.... etc..... I don't just report a bot because he warped away when he jumped in local.  There are a lot of tell tale signs, and using a blue alt to confirm 100% is very easy.  Most of the bots I have run into auto pull drones when you start shooting one of them. Do that with a blue alt and watch the not completely ignore you on grid.  Web and scram the bot, bump it, bubble it.  watch what it does.
---
I mean, I feel that one, but I do find it laughable how much chestbeating TAPI did for managing to make the big blob with goonies and are now bored out of their minds because they can't pick a fight without it going all TIDI sharp-ish.

Dosnt   that star in the defense multiplai 
---
Dosnt that star in the defense multiplier mean its the capital? 
---
If you are having difficulty with the very concept of focusing your skills,  eve is honestly probably not the game for you. Going the injector route will probably just make you bitter and contemptful of the mechanic even more.  
---
It only takes a week or two to fly most ships semi effectively. Non-capital you can almost always completely master within 3 months. Eve requires experimentation and a fair bit of self direction and patience.  It's a slow game.  
---
So if you're not enjoying a role or experience with level 4 skills there's not really a good reason to suspect that you'll enjoy it with level 5 skills.  
---
And as a note on T2 ships, definitely experiment with t1 first.  Training an interceptor might only take 9 days, but most t2 ships,  especially marauders and command ships take a pretty decent chunk of time to get into the hull and have extremely specialized roles that you probably don't need to worry about until you've found something you like to do long enough that the month goes by in no time

Triglavian ships technically are considered T1, they don't have the little green icon thing on the thumbnails.
---
It's hard to go wrong by purchasing ore in Delve and refining it yourself. It's heavily discounted below galactic prices. You won't find much profit in T1 subcap hulls though, since the barrier to entry is so low and many Goons build them simply as a means to dispose of leftover tritanium and pyerite, with little regard to profit. 
---
You would do much better gain access to some moons and use your Rorqual to gather goo. Do some reactions and sell some of your outputs, and buy other outputs so you can build the T2 components and assemble them into your own T2 hulls. And before you rule that out as being too complicated, remember that the barrier to entry is what makes it so profitable.

Yes. That still does absolutely nothing to deny people anchoring permission. It doesn't even adjust how long it takes to anchor which is purely based on Strat index.

A corp full of bots joining your rental alliance? Hand out a warning to the alliance leaders (not only the puppet leader of that rental alliance), repeated offenses result in a ban.
---
A greedy corp leader inviting countless of bots? Go after the corp leader. 
---
Sounds too harsh or impossible check beforehand? 
---
Then stop renting out to random people throwing isk your way and vet corps &amp; members.
---
Alliance &amp; corp leaders don't care if someone is botting and only react when it is too obvious because they have nothing to fear.
---
not too sold on giving so much caldari traits when they fly amarr vessels perhaps something middlegound.
---
Eom:
---
main forte -&gt; hybrid turrets + armor tanking with ECM as EWAR option
---
\-Amarr bonus -&gt;  Hybrid Turret optimal range
---
\-Caldari bonus -&gt; ECM strength (and range?)
---
\-Role bonus -&gt; targets jammed by this ship cannot target back to the source (old style ECM basically, effect doesnt count for ECM drones), X00% bonus to Hybrid Turret Damage (to compensate low amount of highs)
---
ships would have low amount of highs for weapons but would compensate by having more mids than usual Amarr vessels, they would still be designed towards Armor Tank but with enough slots to put tackle + prop + ECM. small dronebay to evade abuse since its mainly a gunship.
---
as for the other factions.
---
Ammatar:
---
main forte -&gt; projectile turrets + armor tanking + weapon disruption
---
\-Amarr bonus -&gt; weapon disruption effectiveness
---
\-Minmatar bonus -&gt; Projectile Turret falloff
---
\-Role bonus -&gt; X00% bonus to Projectile Turret damage, 37,5% bonus to armor repair amount
---
ships are based on Minmatar design but have been adapted to work with Amarr standards of warfare so instead of shield boosting they use bonused armor repairers and make use of more powerfull weapon disruptors (with no range bonus) than the usual Amarr EWAR ships (with no range bonus tho)
---
Intaki Syndicate(?):
---
the syndicate has a good share of control of the black market from what i gather, we dont really have a faction in the game that fuses minmatar and caldari lorewise but seeing that the Intaki had some empathy to the struggle of the Caldari people during the war and that the leader of the syndicate has ties to the Serpentis themselves. it wouldnt be crazy to think they couldnt achieve that by contracting some work from the Angels directly or via the Serpentis Corporation connections, and the other half with some corporate associates inside the Caldari State.
---
main forte -&gt; missiles + shield tank + TP
---
\-Minmatar bonus -&gt; missile launcher rate of fire
---
\-Caldari bonus -&gt; reduction in explosion radius or increase in explosion velocity
---
\-Role bonus -&gt; 50% bonus to TP effectiveness, 37,5% bonus to shield boost amount
---
ships have their own design this time, wherea Gurista ships make use of raw power and tank and the Mordus ships use kiting tactics the Syndicate ships use a medium range approach with higher application and active tank potential (not sure if that actually synergizes).
---
I believe so. I think all are welcome. Plus it’s probably cheaper than what they’re gouging you at the keepstar ;)
---
In 2019, how are we still surprised that people, in general, want to fly the bigger ships? Given a game that is nearing 20 years of age, it would be weird to think there weren't many of them in game.
---
You're definitely stating the obvious.

Mar5hy got caught input broadcasting some random comment he typed got entered into different chat channels across 10 or so clients. Then wastedruncycles promised he'd eat his hat if Mar5hy got banned. Then Mar5hy got banned.

C2 with null and C3 static. Like the other C2 guy suggested, C3 will be your sweet spot for PVE and will provide WH pvp. The null will provide k-space pvp. The only downside is no constant HS, but you wanted a bit of risk and this gives you more content in exchange for it.

---
&gt; What kind of mindless advice is this? General consensus is capital saturation is breaking the game and then here we go, more players suggesting newbros get into carriers which are some of the least flavor diverse ships in game?
---
The general reddit-consens is that Capital Saturation is a problem for the Elitist-PvP'er that is too a-social to form up a group, yes. 
---
Capitals are just good at making ISK though, too bad you don't like that but that's part of the reason why people struggle in their early days.

People trying to deny other people the easy ISK they could use so they get stuck in the subpar low level income playing field with them, Congrats!

While 2fa does improve security, 2fa can be beaten, especially if someone can get to a position to man-in-the-middle your 2fa device. Not that I think thats common, just that it can happen. Also, as another commenter pointed out, skillpoint lock is not the same request as a 2fa security feature. Additionally, there are people that have jobs where they can't realistically expect to have access to the same 2fa device for an extended period of time. I previously had a job where I would not be bringing my personal mobile device with me and would want to enjoy eve during the several months I would be away and using a provided cell phone. These things do happen and 2fa is not a catch-all solution, EVEN IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR 99% OF EVERYONE (Seriously do 2fa if you can). That having been said... even though I don't do that anymore, please allow skillpoint lock.

Don't tease bb, you were never gonna go. If you were actually serious then just crash at my place.

Love this idea, and wanted to look at doing it myself, but the issue is, how can you trust the other pilots under you to not blue scout for other hunting entities.  Also getting the major corps/alliances on board to support this will be difficult, because while some might vouch others won't.

I've seen some terrible leshak fits but like damn

Thank god I finished this 7 years ago.

Blessed be the Rifter hull.

training this on multiple toons is basically why I afk train now. it literally killed my soul.

Since goons are now WH pvp'ers, we desperately need some nullsec representation. Otherwise they're gonna nerf delve and ruin the game.
---
Why are you turning this into a personal case about what I "like" or not? I don't care. Sounds like you ran out of arguments.

You might be able to find some deals on lodging still,  even if the main hotels are too expensive,  worth looking into this far in advance at least.

Here's the dilemma. Mar5hy was banned because he screwed up. He provided pretty objective proof that is easily measurable. Using service logs, it's pretty trivial for CCP to verify that the same IP sent out the same chat input to X accounts in a very small timespan. It's pretty easy to verify and an appropriate ban was issued.   
---
Other bots can do fancy things like route traffic across other IPs. Even a few actions across a very small delta time are easy for some players to really do without botting/input broadcasting... so unless those rats are ALL issuing the same fire commands across hundreds of vessels from the same IP in less than a second; I don't think you're going to have luck here.  
---
People are screaming that Mar5hy gets banned 'cause conspiracy and favoritism. False. He was banned because what he did was easy to prove. CCP would have banned anyone else doing the same thing.   
---
This makes just as much sense as if PH started complaining about Test dropping caps on a newbie alliance, instead of dropping our titans on top of them. Brave has supers, Titans, and allies too. If they can’t/don’t counter drop with either more dreads or Titans, it’s their own fault.

hell ya brother cheers from delve. theyre such shit BL sucks and is the WORST. they came down to delve and we bit their dicks off. i put so many BL dicks in my mouth and bit them right off fucking stuppid shit posters!!!!

How to get someone to stop: continue to feed him attention
---
&gt; especially if someone can get to a position to man-in-the-middle your 2fa device
---
Sure, if you've installed a certificate from someone you shouldn't and are getting MITM'd while setting up 2FA. This would require you to intentionally compromise your security and there are no defenses against that if you are willfully handing out the keys to your internet life. Most people don't even know how to do all this so it's not really a threat.
---
&gt; can't realistically expect to have access to the same 2fa device for an extended period of time.
---
You just need access to the same device you play EVE on. You don't need to set it up on a mobile device. Therefore you can travel all you want without your mobile device while being able to play EVE.
---
Oh, please. The Jurassic Park/World/whatever dinos are far too intelligent to be members of TEST.
---
You need to build a base to live out of. Astrahus or even Raitaru suffices. It doesn't need to be fueled. You'll need at least one scanning alt that stays in the WH full time who can find a path back in if your main gets podded out or rolled out. And since you have minimal ability to defend your structure, you should keep a low profile to avoid drawing attention.
---
nah just a LOT of botting/ratting in Drones for the past 5yrs
---
I think the idea is this: when people app we’ll have separate opsec fleets. So guys who are blue to say Imperium can patrol Imperium space, guys who are blue to panfam their space and so on. We’ll use standard api checks to match task forces, or if it’s clear we can’t maintain opsecs then we’ll establish an alliance and allow each group to have their own regional police force with shared cross Interpol intelligence at alliance level. Any player we can[t verify will be put in general fleets and patrol npc space or the places we know everyone doesn’t care about because not blue. I don’t pretend to have all the answers, which is why I need people who can help with things like diplomacy to develop vetting policies and solve problems like you raised - realistically we can’t keep awoxxers out of alliance level fleets so it is always a problem, but if alliances are willing to work together and say ‘this policy we will support’ then we can get there.
---
This is why it’s a PSA. It’s going to take everyone’s brains to work out how to self Police our community, because CCP will go bust trying to do this, and our entire game is at stake here. 
---
Not doing things because they are difficult is not the Eve way, we need to find solutions. I’m open to any and all suggestions but doing anything is better than nothing.
---
UAG’s used to be apart of da imbalance.
---
I would assume that Corp was kicked and didn’t give it up
---
No, you are dumb for assuming that your behavior is what normal non bot behavior is.  You are also dumb for assuming I simply click the report button when I don't catch a VNI.  I encourage you to roam around in a captor, especially around rental systems and catch some bots, look at the names of the characters, their corp history, start date, loss mails, etc.... You start to see simplistic patterns.  You can also cross reference that data with dotlan to see how long these bots rat on average in those systems. most people aren't ratting 20+ hours a day non stop.

As an alliance who has held Providence Space for over a Year now, HTP have certainly earned the right to weigh in on rules and allowances? Our pilots presence should be noted as a little diplomatic opinion in the inner workings of Provi-space.
---
Shut up bot cunt
---
But were they Warned that the situation had changed prior to the clearly unprovoked attack? #notmyprovi
---
I would find it more suspicious for someone to run one VNI than several. You may more money for the same amount of effort watching a single window's local. You think someone is going to rent a nullsec system just to run their single VNI alt? The only suspicious part is using a POS that can defend itself vs. a raitaru that can't.

You missed the point. It's about the dscan result of 30 drones out in space in 1 tick to 0 drones out in space in the next tick. It's either a macro like isboxer or a bot. Both of which are illegal under EULA.

It gets even more amusing when you enter a local like MJ-5 in P Falls and watch 1 month old carriers all magically warp off at the identical time.

well just use the long hull as a stand in for all 3 barges and write all 3 names next to it

Fuck its hard to word that without sounding like a bigot.
---
Because you can not tell in most cases, with 100% sure, if someone is using a bot or not.

C2 with C3/HS static is a great way to make iskies. Dual box tengu/rattle (can also be done solo) in the C3 will net you 100m+ /hour, but the HS will make it more likely to get evicted if you're running a one man corp.

It's no unrelated. They're both violations of the ToS but need sufficient evidence to prompt action. Also the structure of the title seems to link relate it pretty well... I'm trying to explain why it's so difficult to ban the botters. Reddit seems to believe two things. That the problem totally isn't their alliance, it's everyone else, and that catching bots is super easy, CCP is just flaking.  I don't think either of those are true statements. If we can develop better ways of reporting them together by understanding what aspects of catching them are difficult, EVE will be better. For example, if we can identify sets of botters operated by the same person and attack them all at once.. their bot actions will be sent to the server simultaneously which might, ya know, get logged. Just a thought.

We’re not doing their job for them, we’re doing our job for us. Botting primarily affects players through isk inflation on plex and skill injectors. CCP gets paid for all the plex regardless so the only people who lose out are us. If you think any game company has the resources to police a MMO then you are mistaken, volunteer GM’s and ISD’s have always been required to help the community regulate itself. Some people care enough about the game and the community to donate their playtime to help others, some just expect everything done for them. It people don’t want to step up, then fine - it was tried, as Jeff Bezos said - complaining is not a strategy.
---
Bear in mind that you're actually trying to discuss the botting issue. That's not what this thread is about. You're not doing anything wrong, but if the responses aren't what you're expecting, that's why.
---
literally nothing has changed.

If its in nullsec, its a bot.

no, trusn me. thets just credit card boy...
---
&gt; Botting primarily affects players through isk inflation on plex and skill injectors.
---
no, those things go up in price because there's way more uses for plex, and there hasn't been a sale for ages. it's supply and demand not isk inflation.
---
I havent noticed a change. I love the changes to the game CCP has implamented over the past year. It seems like they are listening to suggestions from our CSM player team.

This post has some pretty serious misconceptions about how eve works baked into it
---
&gt;  I at the time resented the fact that I would never be able to catch up in SP to a player that started even hours before I did regardless of the actions I take in-game
---
unless, you know, he mismanages his skill que and has a couple days where he isn't training (less of an issue now than in the past, but still something that can happen) or takes a break from the game for a month or two, or has cheaper learning implants or trains off-remap skills, or has a general int/percept remap instead of a focused remap etc, there are and have always been lots of ways for people to catch up or fall behind on the "sp grind"
---
Also, as MANY other people have pointed out, sp isn't nearly as much of a limitation as you seem to think it is. 80% of the value of a skill is gained in the first 4 levels which takes up 17% of the total training time. The only real reason to train a skill to 5 is if you need it to be able to use something, or if you have nothing else to train.
---
&gt;  I don't know how to convey the feelings that surround knowing the skills I would require to do something fairly lucrative / exciting / dangerous would require 230+ days of OMEGA training (C3 WH ratting) 
---
You don't have to convey the feelings around knowing that, because its fucking bullshit and  whoever told you that is full of absolute horse shit.
---
Heres two fits that can do it with like two weeks of training
---
    [Rattlesnake, C3 Ratting]
---
    
---
    Shield Power Relay II
---
    Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
    Gistum C-Type EM Ward Amplifier
---
    Gistum C-Type Thermal Dissipation Amplifier
---
    Large Shield Extender II
---
    Gistum C-Type Kinetic Deflection Amplifier
---
    Large Micro Jump Drive
---
    Rapid Heavy Missile Launcher I, Inferno Heavy Missile
---
    [Empty High slot]
---
    Large Core Defense Field Purger I
---
    Gecko x1
---
When using this rattlesnake fit bring a mobile depot and spare damage mods for your lowslots, you don't really need that much tank most of the time and if you have a mobile depot and damage mods in your cargo you can swap out the power relays for more damage. Don't refit the MJD, if anything shows up on dscan just pull your drone and mjd out of the site to get safe.
---
    [Vexor Navy Issue, RR C3]
---
    Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II
---
    Armor Kinetic Hardener II
---
    Armor Explosive Hardener II
---
    Armor Thermal Hardener II
---
    Large Compact Pb-Acid Cap Battery
---
    Cap Recharger II
---
    Medium Remote Armor Repairer II
---
    Medium Remote Repair Augmentor I
---
    Imperial Navy Praetor x5
---
This fit is even cheaper for the true new player who has no isk, needs a partner to run though and your more likely to die since it has no mjd. Same deal as with the rattlesnake, bring a depot so you can swap between tank and dps as the site demands.
---
Hell, i have a c5 farm hole where most of my characters (i run 4 snakes because the accounts are already plexed, it makes the sites faster and im a special snowflake, i know it can be done with 2) around 5m sp because thats all they really need
---
tl;dr theres a TON of shit you can do in this game in cheap low sp ships, enjoy the feeling of having something to look forward to and work towards, because it goes away a lot faster than you can possibly imagine.
---
not new, just saying that thats some impressive damage and it must have taken a WHILE to get that leshak dead

My apologies - I didn't mean to mislead. I only mentioned that I do 7-day extractions to illustrate that one doesn't need to be in a wormhole 24/7. I'm currently doing all my PI on my main, so I reset extractors when it's convenient. Sometimes that's daily, sometimes that's weekly - whenever I stop by. Again, if I kept a PI character in the wormhole to do true daily extractions I'm sure I could get quite a bit more out of it (and I'm training my scanner to do so eventually). I do generally build up a backlog of materials, then send it to my factory planet once a week or so, as my factory planet can catch up to my mining very quickly. 
---
As far as how to do Organic Mortar Applicators on one character, it's quite simple; as Basil mentions below, it's the easiest P4. Here's my setup.
---
Barren Planet:
---
Extractor Control Unit 1: Noble Metals
---
Extractor Control Unit 2: Base Metals
---
Basic Processor 1: Transforms Noble Metals to Precious Metals
---
Basic Processor 2: Transforms Noble Metals to Precious Metals
---
Basic Processor 3: Transforms Noble Metals to Precious Metals
---
Basic Processor 4: Transforms Base Metals to Reactive Metals
---
Basic Processor 5: Transforms Base Metals to Reactive Metals
---
Basic Processor 6: Transforms Base Metals to Reactive Metals
---
Advanced Processor 1: Transforms Base Metals and Reactive Metals to Mechanical Parts
---
Advanced Processor 2: Transforms Base Metals and Reactive Metals to Mechanical Parts
---
Advanced Processor 3: Transforms Base Metals and Reactive Metals to Mechanical Parts
---
And, I also have a Storage Facility and a Launcher
---
Similarly, my Lava Planet farms Heavy Metals and Non-CS Crystals, creating Consumer Electronics, and I have two gas planets; one takes Aqueous Liquids and Ionic Solutions to make Coolant, and one takes Noble Gas and Reactive Gas to make Oxides. My fifth planet just farms Microorganisms and processes to get Bacteria.
---
The factory planet combines the Coolant, Oxides, Mechanical parts, and Consumer electronics to make Condensates and Robotics, then combines that with the Bacteria to make Organic Mortar Applicators.
---
Here's an example of my mining planet setup and my factory planet setup:

lol thats where i got it from

It takes less than 45 days to train:
---
* All races of all T1 ships to level 3.  This also gives one access to all navy and faction (aka pirate) ships.
---
* All races of T1 weapons to level 3, and all their support skills to level 3.  [I believe this also gives one access to all T1, navy, faction, and deadspace variations.]
---
T2 is considered specialization, and is supposed to be an investment (i.e. time-sink).  Hence level 5 is required for nearly all T2 ships and weapons, and takes so long to train.  Training levels 1~4 take 11% of the time, and give you 80% of the bonuses.

i love my SASH corp CEO. he takes the reigns of the corp then goes AFK for 2 weeks. TY Warran Simalia . without you we wouldn't keep the SASH tradition of AFK CEO.

I don’t know is the answer. Maybe if we do a good enough job of co-ordinating and gathering intelligence to reduce their workload they’ll give us goodie bags of free police skins or plex rewards. Maybe that is a conversation our CSM can have to suggest a reward bounty system for successful bot cleansing. But realistically we need to prove to CCP we can organise ourselves into a self-policing community and provide some use to them in capturing verifiable evidence in a format that reduces their workload enough to speed up the banning process. I would welcome the contribution of ideas of a ‘wishlist’ we could take to CCP, be it proper vetting and registering as community ISD officers with extra powers like being invisible in local - but as raised above we would have to prove we can set up a vetting system so it’s not used for nefarious purposes. We’d only deserve rewards from CCP if we actually did something constructive, and we’d only get any sort of response from them if we demonstrated we can put together workable proposals. None of which will be solved overnight, or by a single player but by a committed group focused on dealing with it. 
---
I can’t promise anything at this stage because the first plan is simply to get a handful of experienced people who understand the game mechanics and the problems we’ll face and say, how can we do this? What needs to change from CCP we can take to the csm?  Our ability to do that is reliant on people who care enough about the game to volunteer their time and ideas for the benefit of everyone who thinks bots are a problem. If it doesn’t work out then we gave people and CCP the opportunity to work together but clearly there wasn’t enough motivation from either to change the current state of things. 
---
As I said, I don’t even know if we can be effective, but i’m willing to give it a try and see what we can do together. If the community doesn’t care, well, we’ll see if CCP fixes it or what detriment it has on the game in time. Worse case scenario people can throw an alt in the Corp and do some ratting in the botters system and make some isk while keeping them docked. 
---
&gt; T2 guns/modules are *massive*, and the actual reason to train skills to 5. 
---
the difference between t1 and t2 guns has nothing to do with the benefit from the skill itself and everything to do with the item itself, which is something the guy you responded to mentioned
---
&gt;  *Deep Core Mining*, *Jump Portal Activation* and *Fleet Command* 
---
jump portal generation reduces your fuel usage and fleet command just increases the size of your area of effect without making it a stronger effect, both of which can be lived with, and neither of which effect a 7.5m sp character. Also when JDC and logistics exist, how are those your go to examples of things worth training to 5
---
Point taken.  In Eve, everyone is kind and gentle and accepts one another without ever doing what they 'can' do.

if that's the best compensation on offer, then i'll carry on not giving a shit. it ain't worth my time.
---
I'd really like to do that, and it certainly will be the case for Provi alliances who don't participate in attacking it. But it's tricky when they attack the structure. Feelsbad to let them tether the caps they're using to destroy it.
---
That said, the diplo lines are open or instead of a specific conversation maybe it just doesn't get shot for a while and then we can relax that docking restriction.

Beyond the reporting of intelligence i’m not. There is a simple rule in Eve, if you are undocked you are content. Code eradicated the afk haulers and miners from highsec, nullspace should not be zero risk PvP making, we get to camp them in and run their anoms, making legitimate isk. If they want to move us on they have to undock and actually fight - free content opportunity. I’m not expecting people to put their mains in 24/7 but if you donate a few hours of your alt time to go on a cruiser patrol you’ll either get a fight with the botters or you’ll get some PVE time in. Either way people who want to do that will benefit, the evidence gathering is trivial and we’ll collate it at corp level saving people filing tickets for everything. -Police fleets can be fun, if it’s not your thing in content or you expect to be paid by CCP then idk, don’t get involved I guess.

I do PI on two characters with 12 planets in null sec, making one t3 final product and it nets me close to 1b/month if i'm really diligent about resetting cycle times  when  they are done. It took me a few months of trial and error, optimizing factory/extractor setups, and changing which products i was creating to really be successful. It is a great source of passive income for me as i don't have the time/patience to krab for hours on end anymore.  Command Center upgrades 5 makes a big difference, as well as being able to set up on 6 planets per toon. so to me, def worth it.

Are you sure you're not mixing EHP with raw damage? ZKill always shows the raw damage, without any resists factored in, and usually all the tools show ehp (factoring in resists) as it's much more useful.
---
A basic skill plan is 60 days, and will get you into the vast majority of ships in Eve.
---
Mainly because he is one of the most vocal. From what I can see in the notes though he's one of the most active. Has anyone heard anything from the other half of the GS candidates? No. Dude does great work but people like to get worked up about shit
---
Nope, removed between terms.
---
I've wondered since i started using cloaking modules, if the untargetable status starts at the beginning of the cloaking animation, or at the end?
---
I've searched for that answer everywhere, even saw some YT tutorials, and i found nothing :( i know it may sound stupid, but sincerely i haven't found the info about it.
---
Also, how can i count the server "ticks"(i read somewhere that this was the cause) because when i start the warp and  i hit the cloaking module, sometimes the cloaking starts at the same time as the alignment, sometimes it doesn't let me activate it for a brief period after the animation.
---
Thank you.
---
So far, at least, nothing much seems to have changed. If pearl are meddling, they're doing so very quietly. 
---
I’m curious why r/eve is so happy for him to be banned?
---
He forced bots to go into hiding while he camped, forced spodbrains to be on their toes while he was in system, and made, otherwise risk free, uncontested ratting have some sort of risk involved.
---
Afters threads upon threads of grr bots or nullsec is too safe for ratters, why is it that people are so eager to be happy that he’s banned?
---
Because the only way to compete with the Imperium Might and Organization is to actually bot. Spodbrain vs scripts. The spider remains Superior.
---
I bet if we look through the something awful forums we can find a few things. 
---
Go back to 4chan mate
---
I only see 1 scimi of twitch streamer,  not to mention I didn't even include each of your trail of tears losses in other systems after most of our dunks, but by all means feel free to point all kills not shown on the brs
---
Hope you got 20bux. The archives upgrade costs extra.
---
botter boii
---
What do you feel far away from?
---
Capitals?
---
With over a year-and-half under your belt, you should have a TON of options, and have mastered everything small and medium.
---
He broke the rules. End of discussion.
---
They haven't (yet) introduced any P2W mechanics and monetization (Skins for ships) are basically the same as before. Less sales with lower discounts but that was probably CCP making numbers look better for PA.
---
In short. So far everything is going on normal.
---
That’s not my question
---
Because null crabs dont like the risk being put into null activitys
---
ASSES Assemble!
---
That they did, and given that it was phased out pretty quick and not tried again (until now with better rewards) shows that it was most likely just a test of concept thing, otherwise I'd imagine we would have seen more of them/it.
---
New owners of CCP. Before CCP was an independent studio/company owned by shareholders. Now Pearl Abyss (A korean company that publishes an MMO and had a bad rep about making it Pay to Win) owns majority of it.
---
Capital ships V is right up there 
---
They would rather shoot it and get dunked to the tune of 40b every other day than try to behave themselves like proper members of an NRDS alliance should. They already set the structure kos for just being there. 
---
&gt; or do nothing and let them deal with it
---
given it's literally their job to deal with it as that's what we pay our subscriptions for, i'm going to go with this option.
---
Maxing skills and tactics fir cruisers is never a bad move.
---
No one cares
---
Goons have a hate boner for him
---
&gt;why is it that people are so eager to be happy that he’s banned?
---
because he was breaking the rules, and nobody is above the rules ccp has laid out.
---
Look mom! I dunked an empty JF at a cyno beacon uncontested!  I'm elite!
---
Just remove it 
---
That's the answer to your question. He broke the rules, he got banned, and he deserves it. There's no exception to the rule against input broadcasting for people who do things that you like. Break the rules, and you're gone, and good riddance to you.
---
Distillery District is also pretty neat if the weather is nice and you want to walk around and see something a bit different!
---
To clarify: Missiles don't need fuel because like in real life, the fuel is in the ammunition itself. The same goes for the projectiles. Hybrid and Lasers need Capacitor because the formers are based in the electromagnetic proppeled projectile principle, and the latter... Well, are lazors, we all know how lasers work :-)
---
Big Adults Doing Awesome Space Ships Entirely Sanely
---
Or something. 
---
Yeah, I'm an idiot. I somehow thought that P2s need four P0s as inputs, which of course is wrong. I've done what you do with four characters and Integrity Response Drones, which makes my remarks even more embarrassing.
---
It's not /r/eve that hates him, it's the Imperium vote brigade. They're angry because he made it somewhat harder for their massive number of bots to operate. They pushed to get him banned and due to their disproportionate influence on CCP they were successful. 
---
The game is probably more corrupt than it's been since the T2 scandal.
---
if you're multiboxing in a fleet and fleet warp them though
---
he's a cheater pure and simple and I hate cheaters
---
when I had to stop broadcasting my mining farm I lost a huge amount of isk/h so why is it ok if he can broadcast???? will he reimburse my lost isk??
---
Nice job, I’m always impressed by the people who are able to stay on a grid for a while without getting tackled and killed. 
---
I suspect he's more Gandhi 2, no more Mr Passive Resistance.
---
You care enough to post a reply

Ever wondered how long a lore plot could live in Eve Online? Nearly ten years passed since [Holene Vailakkel, a prominent Caldari physicist working for the Lai Dai Corporation, was the target of a digital assault]( https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/lai-dai-scientist-in-coma-following-cybernetic-attack-1/) and now, a decade later a similar tactic is used to attack Zainou and Aliastra facilities.

News for today:

* Semiki Aliastra staff infected with cybernetics-targeted malware, neurological problems reported
---
* Darknet data brokers indicate Guristas research priority CONCORD target
---
* Raata Zaibatsu Syrikos Hounds poisoned by unknown assailants using Kresh toxin

Abyssal space is a nice break from lvl 4 missions. I so far have loved Jintaan's giant lazer scalpel makeing much needed changes for the health of the game. It is a monumental task trying to fix fozzie sov claws. The new triglavian ships fill a niche in the game I didn't know that we needed. With the structures: it is darn cool to have everything be able to be blown up and destroyed.   Maybe these changes came too fast and I wasnt able to fully appreciate the 500mn Hictors having perfect cornering. That's ok. They sounded totally broken. I love the job CCP does. 
---
I bought close to 200 at 25-28m each
---
Unfortunately, no. No sympathy for spodbrains 
---
Oh and the Change to War Declartations!
---
Because the majority of eve just wants to mine in peace these days.
---
Perfect! Also EdX has [a bunch](https://www.edx.org/learn/excel) of Excel courses.
---
Will I get Doug Ford aggro though?
---
Its difficult to offend all of you as well as I am if I'm posting on 4chan. 
---
But at least I coward'd out and deleted the comment eh? 
---
Is he really banned?  Has he come out and said so, if not how do we know he is banned?  
---
Heard of the fleet warp mechanic? Or the regroup fleet command? Probably just has an alt in the POS that recalls the VNIs. 
---
CVA rules doesn't equal game mechanics rules though. I assumed you were asking about game mechanics.
---
Yes. Exploration is terrible now. You should all not do it. Especially not in Stain, or venal. I’m definitely not saying this because it will mean I get more relic sites. 
---
&gt;the game has improved since the PA buyout
---
I mean.. i've never ever seen all chat channels go offline in Eve ever for a full day or more.
---
But, sure... it's improved!
---
I guess those bot farms gotta RMT the bills someway or another and him contesting it made it more difficult for them to make $$$$
---
They are the Council of the Management not The Management. So the name is fine.
---
You seem kind of mad there little trailer park wormholer. 
---
Tell me about your feelings on your Tumblr there bubbie boo. 
---
Thank u next 
---
Great stuff. Add some faction supers to make this  better :)
---
My FC warps 255 other people with the fleet warp command. And can have 255 people warp to him with the regroup command. He must be a bot! 
---
Shoutouts to my main man Valkorsia for running a smooth sailing ship

Fair enough, I see it as an opportunity to do a code type content thing in police skins with a public service benefit. It’ll probably just descend into an oppressive malicious pirates in uniforms tool but you’ve got to at least start with high principals so you can generate reddit drama of a descent into a dumpster. 
---
I miss my super wispererererer 😔
---
But yes, spodbrains want their mining in peace for them rmt bucks
---
Distillery is nice but the actual ratio of places that serve liquor to tourist trappy places hocking knick knacks is a bit low.  You should look into the craft brewery beer passport.  For the East end craft breweries, there's a company where you can charter buses/vans and they'll literally drive you around your craft brew pub crawl.

In essence; bots users are filthy cheaters using external tools to gain an unfair advantage over manual players.  
---
Mar5hy used external tools to gain an unfair advantage over manual players.   
---
Both deserve their fate. 
---
I’m just saying in jest of the recent sperging of ~~goons~~ r/eve
---
We're happy he's banned because anyone who cheats should be banned, miner or cloaky camper alike.
---
Goon management calls it 'meta-gaming'.
---
no we need a new name
---
Does that apply to drones?
---
&gt;forced spodbrains to be on their toes while he was in system, and made, otherwise risk free, uncontested ratting have some sort of risk involved.
---
Answered your own question there, buddy.
---
Damage taken on kills is the raw damage, so the damage you take after it's reduced by your resistances.
---
No, he's the premier, not the mayor.  You might be thinking of his late brother, Rob.
---
Not nearly proportinal to their greatness(ahould take up the whole screen) but a good try nevertheless.

a username is not a real person lol wtf are you 5

Standings are primarily used for trade discounts these days.

---
I never spent a dime on this game. Nor will I tbh. Plexing is actually useful for the game. Just because you're part of "NCdot hurr durr l33t pvp" and like 9 out of the 10 dudes you talk to also pay for subs doesn't mean everyone else of the "alleged" 350k players since 2013 do the same.
---
High five*
---
I’m sorry but input broadcasting a chat channel breaks the game how?
---
alts ... like do you have all your accounts on the same email/ip/pc?
---
Lol
---
Tapi has sole ownership on local channels to attempt to overload the 8bit server nodes by spamming dinobrain comments
---
Aren’t u a spodbrain too tho
---
&gt; Because the majority of eve just wants to mine in peace these days.
---
well you don't exactly go on a roam in a rorqual, do you? so of course you want to be left in peace.
---
5/T/India, u?
---
Still feel far from tech 2 cruiser/battlecruisers. Still feel far from efficient indy skills. 
---
I’m curious why r/eve is so happy for him to be banned?                 
---
#Because i don't want to compete in EVE with bots, isboxers  ... or simply cheaters. 
---
No, I just feed 2b t3s to spodbrains
---
You decide who the real ~~winner~~ loser here
---
Exactly
---
Yep, this was with minimum skills required
---
except goon bots
---
those get reported to leadership not ccp 
---
If one person in a corp shoots someone in Providence, they set the entire corp red. 
---
If someone else from that corp who has never violated their rules merely scouts a non-combat ship through their space, not aggressing anyone is enough to set the entire corp of the hauling ship red by mere association, that's not "giving them a chance to be true neutrals". That's looking for easy targets.
---
If three steps of seperation is enough to get negative standing in Providence, then your options are joining an NPC corp or an actual Provi block alliance. Otherwise you cannot stay neutral in their space.

Department of Everything and Anything Destroying the GAME
---
I'm a poor faction warfare nerd. I'd get hotdropped if I even thought about faction supers. They're forbidden fruit. 
---
You sure you burned out all your guns?
---
The guns in the middle will burn out faster than the ones towards the edge, since they get more dissipated heat damage from neighbouring guns.
---
This is just a sidenote, but with three accounts in the past, I could make enough fuel to run a large and small POS indefinitely with some leftover.
---
Now I only do basic refine (1 level refine) on one account with 6 planets, and even this gets about 30 mil / day, picking up once every 4-5 days.
---
I'll be honest - i've not seen any bots in delve since i've been there.
---
then again, i don't go looking for them either since... why would i? i'm too busy playing eve.
---
Your killboard does that for me HaHAA
---
I miss old days mate :)
---
Perhaps the caps they are dropping on subcaps are bait hoping the subcap they are killing is bait for an escalation. But hey, if you dont like cynos you can always move to HS where there are no cynos. 
---
It doesn't, but using input multiplexing is against the EULA. Doing it in a chat channel is just a very elegant proof that you're using input multiplexing.
---
Where are the SOE ships?  Also, aren't there Navy Cruisers and Battleships?
---
I know, I stand by my concerns. It's not like Doug Ford has any love for Toronto, let alone the rest of the province.
---
Is buck a beer a thing yet?
---
You generally shouldn't have to duakbox tengu or rattle for c3, I have a solo c3 fit that's under a bil that can run all the sites including data/relic with an mjd equipped. If you going it a bit  (1.4 bil ish) you're running the 40 mil and 45 mil sites in 10 minutes, warp to to warp to. 250 mil an hour ish not including salvage. 
---
On mobile rn but let me know later tonight if you want the fit :)
---
Resigned, no?
---
Mitten's Kittens
---
I actually started to miss these 
---
read it again. warp 7 toons at the exact same time to 7 **UNIQUE** anomalies. meaning warping 7 characters to DIFFERENT places, at once.
---
Whilst there are faction corvettes, they're special edition ships.  Have yet to see a Violator or an Echo in the wild. 
---
You don't really have the cash for anything that requires tons of SP. If you're willing to RMT into the cash that does, perhaps RMT the SP too?
---
strange, I didn't know fleet warp would allow 7 toons to warp to/from 7 unique off grid locations in one click.  We FCs must be doing it wrong.
---
No sympathy for cheaters
---
I don't drink, I just like the architecture!
---
Beginning. The cloaking/decloaking effect is purely a graphical thing. You are cloaked the moment that you activate the cloaking module and it is highlighted green. You are uncloaked the moment the module is deactivated, or the moment you start moving or aligning (for a gate cloak). 
---
You kind of answered your own question about server ticks, too. Sometimes activating a module doesn't seem to "take" right away and that's usually because of the server tick delay (though it can also be due to lag on your client's end, or because of TiDi).
---
Because reddit has a lot of test and goon members, which are frequently BB targets. It’s just bias/majority voicing they’re opinions. Also input broadcasting is kinda dumb so you get those people in there too happy to see CCP doing maybe something about it. Not sure we’ve even seen proof he’s banned 
---
And people like you are oblivious to the chants of how bad botting is lmao
---
Being complicit does not mean it’s not happening lol
---
regroup does that. 
---
Ashmooh
---
i'm not oblivious to people whining like bitches about botting.
---
Doesn't take long to hit a few shortcuts that recall drones, one shortcut for each client, after doing the regroup command. 
---
Brb, buying out hats in jita
---
&gt; i don't go looking for them either since... why would i?
---
Wise choice my friend. Since reporting them would be goonfucking but you also believe "nobody is above the rules ccp has laid out"
---
SoE ships are cloaked. 
---
Well for industry, you only need level 3 to manufacture nearly everything, and level 4 to research a few odd BPO (like rigs).
---
I kind of wonder what you've been training to level 5, as most people make that mistake, i.e. specializing too much.
---
As for T2 BC, they are extremely specialized.  Nice to have, but not usually doctrine / required.  I'd really suggest working more on the other cruisers, as there is FAR more variety of them (there are more cruisers in the game than any other ship type).
---
wish people would stop with this inflation nonsense, what exactly costs more than it used to? 
---
other than the actual price of RMT isk which has gone slightly up in the last few months 
---
C-type invuls, x-type specific hardener, RF cap battery, fn 10mn ab, pith x type large shield booster, 1x c3ax bcu, 2x navy dda, semiconductor memory cell rigs. Rlml in highs. 
---
Mid-grade crystals &amp; 3% implants.
---
Cap battery and shield booster improved with mutaplasmid.
---
Runs shield booster cap stable, could be improved by running a medium shield booster for much greater capacitor to shield efficiency, but would need high-grade crystals.
---
Not in edtain vOv
---
no u
---
Note: no clue if it needs the C-type invuls I got them as abyssal pvp spoils and decided to keep them as trophy. 
---
Now that's boson ratting! 
---
Given the sheer amount of other bots and input broadcasters in literally EVERY major alliance and group, in every corner of the game. I find it incredibly hard to believe that his eventual ban isn't a direct result of conversations and lobbying that took place behind closed doors. Never the less, he broke the rules and got punished so meh, just a shame CCP aren't half as reactive when it comes to the other 10,000+ characters that are also breaking the TOS. I guess its true that the biggest group get the best seat at the table eh.
---
Get to know ppl, eve is more than sp
---
It's like saying to your blues, yes that 1 guy awoxed one of your guys, but why are you upset with us, it was not our whole corp doing it.
---
&gt; Wise choice my friend. Since reporting them would be goonfucking but you also believe "nobody is above the rules ccp has laid out"
---
If there are bots, and ccp want to ban them - i won't give a toss either way.
---
if ccp want to enforce their rules, cool. if they don't, whatever. given that almost every isk making activity in eve is nearly a completely passive affair there's not a lot of stuff that you can or need to bot.
---
Total newbie here. What is this thing?
---
&gt;as very much looked like trying to get login stats up, also they reacted to the botting outcry cause it's bad publicity.EVE is in desperate need for some groundbreaking changes, currently the developers do not have the balls for it.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Reply
---
 To be fair to CCP, everyone is trying their hand at "moving all the things to the cloud" I am in that business and there are best use case and not-so-best.  
---
apparently chats werent great. Live and Learn (I wouldnt put much on PearlAbyss for this)
---
I doubt the developers get to make those kinds of decisions 
---
Yeah well i should have cleared the group to check but the rush got a hold of me lol
---
Down with the bots, up with the cocaine.
---
yeah that's definitely not confirmation lmao
---
&gt;Out of curiosity does TAPI have a wormhole corp?
---
Not since the accident. And then the one after that. And then the one after that. Now it's fuck no and if you talk about spending  time in work holes you get smacked
---
Nah, he ate a 30 day ban, which made him ineligible for running for that term.
---
But it is the least profitable way.
---
Of course it's also the least effort way.
---
Well the Empress likes us better.
---
New deployables, new modules, new shiptypes, abyssal, ship animations, scanner overhauls, map overhauls.
---
If you think refineries or moon mining is more interesting than those things then good for you.  I'm glad someone does.
---
Hm depends a lot on what Old School had ready to jump if needed and then how the fight plays out. In theory both parties had a realistic chance there as bosons are usualy easy to avoid if not suicided into. The Machs would've been enough to threaten the Capitals on grid including the Titan if there were no FAX ready to jump but if you bring a Titan you usualy have FAX in jumprange and at that point Tri would not have stood a chance with the Fleet they had.
---
Even tho numbers and ships play a big role in the outcome of a fight so does how the fleet is being flown so it's hard to predict the "what if"s.
---
I think the stain keepstar is Freeport
---
What am I cherry picking? The submission deployment, the dread feeds, the super feeds, the multiple staging defeats? You're the one going round claiming you did it without supers, even though the reality is you brought supers and just couldn't use them. Also when did TAPI kill 10 northern titans? UALX?
---
No, it wouldn't, because nobody in that scenario actually killed or even shot anyone.
---
It was a case of someone scouting for a hauler. It'd be like saying to your blues "we're resetting you because one of you got scouted through our space by a neutral". Nobody does that.
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
Stop doxxing me
---
It does seem like sarcasm, but seriously, Excel is your friend if profits are your game.
---
Linking apis into excel to real-time monitor price changes for your potential sales / production will give you a decent advantage.
---
You just have to find a reliable market aggregator site that isn't down all the time that you can query.
---
But just being able to open a tab of ammo, modules, ships, and know which one to produce based on trends etc will give you an edge.
---
The problem is people don't perceive the edge because it seems minuscule, but if you add up a 1-3% advantage for everything you put on the market, it adds up when you're talking about billions in product.
---
It's funny cause neither VNIs or those HS battleship miners need omega at all.
---
After the last few days I never thought a "StainGuy" post would brighten my day : )
---
I click related &gt; brinyourspace
---
and expand some hours each way.
---
If you got a br you want me to edit in you can link it here.
---
Wow thaths a lot information, thank you buddy i love these community.
---
Then for hunting, wormholes, mining, exploration. Standings are useless?
---
This would be good if it's how it actually worked but as it turns out, many thousands of characters break TOS on a regular basis and get away with it based on a lack on publicity or properly policed rules. Given that this is the case it seems pretty short sighted to simply say "end of discussion" when this issue is vastly more far reaching that one dude input broadcasting in chat. If you don't want to talk about it though, that's fine, feel free to fuck off :)
---
There's also the fact that warping off inherently issues a recall drones command.
---
So, if a goonswarm guy decide to hellcamp all the nort from PB to drone land by using Bots and Input broadcasting you would be happy ? Because hey, he is only forcing spodbrain to think..
---
Or grow some balls and use regular mechanic and your actual brain to setup a legit hellcamp like NGSA is doing, not cheating, only good management, but looks like the grr-goons side can't do this right ? 
---
The bot craze has reached new levels on /r/eve
---
They don't even need supers, that's dishonest to imply the only reason they are getting megadunked while having x2-3 the pilots is their lack of supers.
---
The discution?
---
ugh I can smell the weeb.  It smells like beard oil.
---
How about a lowsec gate to Thera?
---
Shout out to my FCs in Wingspan! Who keep the fleets flowing and the customers happy!
---
it does? Haven't noticed, some of our FCs always leaves our drones behind XD 
---
lived in Jspace for 6 years now, never had an issue with logistics... it's not that hard to find good connections to haul. 
---
Why not both?
---
they've kept their promise that they wouldn't change how the game is run
---
in the sense that they've done basically nothing to the game since acquisition, missed deadlines, failed to fix things, and have been largely radio silent unless riots break out on reddit
---
i feel valued and respected
---
Honestly, how does input broadcasting help with hellcamping?
---
Whew, at least we've got that going for us.
---
Gandhi 2: Electric Boogaloo 
---
Thank u for this supremely EPIC post, another libtard PWNED.!! 😎😎😎
---
well you should definitely disband and quit the game.
---
Every fight that no supers are on, we won. Every fight that you dropped supers on, you won.
---
I'm happy to talk about it. It makes absolutely no sense to ignore a clear violation of the rules on the basis of other violations that aren't being caught. It's an even worse idea to ignore a clear violation of the rules because it's directed at people who you don't like. The day CCP starts saying that the rules only protect certain groups is the day Eve dies for real. So yes, "he broke the rules" really is the end of any rational discussion on the point.  
---
Is it why when The Imperium deploy near their enemy they hide behind a cyno jammer or dock/tether to avoid loss when there is big fight in their own space ?
---
Edit: The same people crying to not get him banned are the same people crying to get Gaara ban for using input broadcasting, :joy: Good job being hypocrites 
---
Looks good

yes its the game's fault you suck at playing it... lmao
---
What makes a man turn neutral? Desire for vengeance? Lust for power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality...
---
b-but he was doing it for the good guy's !
---
Nice one!
---
It's been 5,741 days since release, and I'm happy to report that you're literally no closer to having a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
A bot wouldn't mwd into another player, it would just warp off
---
ok buddy, have you ever hunted bots? do you understand how server ticks work? do you understand unless you were botting or keybinding it's impossible to pull drones all at once from 7 clients and warp 7 clients within a single server tick, while also watching local for neuts and warping to the correct pings perfectly every single time?? I get you Arte trying to prove your point, but you look like an idiot to anyone that is familiar with hunting bots.
---
Because daddy Mittani told them to feel that way! 
---
yes... yes it is. I guess Racial Titan 5 too
---
Could you draw a picture of what this great gate would look like and sign it with an inspirational caption so I can print it out and put it next my desk for inspiration. 
---
No it doesn't. That only happens if you disconnect.
---
Powerblock Information Service System
---
Yeah but you can rat more than 40m in 30 minutes of rat 
---
Hey bud, just FYI daily GO service leaves at 515am and takes 2 1/2 hours to get to union station. It leaves union at 515pm and total cost round trip is 45 bucks.

^ This. If anything, CCP is trying to push up numbers (logins as well as microtransactions) to prove their worth to PA. 
---
tha'ts not the case sorry. keep it up though, is kinda amusing
---
Don't really see what's wrong with saying both botting and input broadcasting are bullshit and banning the lot?
---
structures are almost always vulnerable
---
Praise our famed fc abkiller
---
Standings are important in faction warfare, and if you don't want faction police shooting at you.
---
Other than that, no, much of the benefits of standings have been removed over the years.
---
&gt; Make sure your recharge/second adjusted with resists  
---
Hmm okay, okay. So for example PYFA says 239EHP/s, and for Perimeter Camp each wave is 195/160/143. So provided I didn't trigger the next wave before all were done, I'd be pretty alright there?  
---
But it's not 100mn fit...
---
Thank you   o7
---
The alpha on that harpy made me chuckle, ever so satisfying. Good video guys &lt;3
---
So all those gila bots or super bots who continuously rat even after proving time and time again that they’re botting and me reporting them but nothing happens yet one guy says a sentence in a chat channel that broadcasts across multiple accounts is banned?
---
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve come across blatant rule breaking but nothing happens to them even after reporting them 
---
ah, classic ccp meme post despite ignoring the big issues
---
never change
---
[But one can only hope, for r/Eve's sake](https://i.imgur.com/ggdhqOw.mp4)
---
Hahaha that was never going to be a thing, it was only his entire platform. 
---
i dont know why CCP did these, maybe the community want its? i think is a good way of people getting better stands get some little extra in all jobs. Anyway thanks for everything my issue is solved now.
---
&gt; how are those your go to examples of things worth training to 5
---
Those are my goto examples for skills that are *not* worth training to four, let alone to five.
---
My irrelevant two cents. 
---
But if your going to call out people for botting. You wanna make sure your not breaking the rules too.
---
Notice he didn't deny pretending he's still alive for the beer rations?
---
Every single botter should be banned, no matter what group they're with, who runs them. But I can't blame CCP for starting with the guy who announced to the entire server that he's breaking the rules.  
---
I’m 100% guaranteed not botting/breaking the rules lol

Ya okay u just wait until NC. Coalition breaks away from Pandemic Horde!! They will join Imperium Legacy and crush horde all along!! I don't think even N3/RUS will be able to stop IMPERIUM LEGACY! Strongest empire in EVE ONLINE: THE SECOND GENESIS

Im sorry. I mean m4rshy not yourself 
---
The reason people wanted him banned.

Ah, I rember the 30d, as the Burn Jita for his return was pretty much what got the game's hooks in me, but I think I know what I was thinking about.

https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/03/29/the-mittanis-crime-punishment-in-eve-online/
---
&gt;Mittani offered a lengthy public apology a few days later, and promised his resignation as Eve Online Council chairman. Since then, Eve devs CCP have decided his actions were a breach of the EULA and are enforcing a harsher penalty.
---
&gt;Mittani is to receive a 30-day ban from Eve – which is, I suspect, quite a handicap for a player as powerful as he – and removed from both the current and next Council of Interstellar Management. “As per our policies, this candidate may be eligible to run at a later date subject to candidacy review,” however.
---
So, yeah, removed, but intended to resign regardless

It's not about what "breaks the game" -- there have been plenty of clever things within the rules that have effectively broken the game, and we _celebrate_ those things (within reason) as clever use of mechanics. And then whine about it until it gets patched, but still.
---
The issue is that Mar5hy _broke the rules,_ and in an egregious, obvious, blatant way. Even if, for whatever reason, he _wasn't_ using input broadcasting for a gameplay advantage -- which is bullshit, why would he be broadcasting otherwise -- that this was so _naked_ made it particularly frustrating.
---
It's like watching someone take a dump in the middle of the street and not see any police action as a result for some time, although that metaphor does break down given CCP don't generally publicly talk about who they ban or anything.
---
Not relevant to OP's question.
---
Maybe start with understanding English first eh :/
---
Farming karma i see ...
---
Yeah, you'd probably be best off swapping your extender rigs to purgers and double checking your passive shield skills too.
---
Well in their case I believe it's so they aren't assumed to be a threat, so they can go about mapping Thera and its various connections without "provoking" a response.
---
The community is lazy ;)
---
Things I can think of that have changed:
---
* Epic arc missions had their standings requirement lowered from 7.0 to 5.0
---
* Jump clones used to require 7.0 to create.
---
* Refining discounts for standing have been replaced by Upwell structures
---
Things that remain:
---
* Mission standing prerequisites.
---
* Research (datacore) agent prerequisite.
---
* Trade fee discounts.
---
* Faction warfare prerequisite.
---

Hang on, I'm pretty sure Gaara _did_ get banned, didn't he?

I'm just very rounded for and only now focusing on getting lvl 4 mastery for all t1 cruisers, i can fly a few t2 ships, amarr recons, amarr covert ops frigs, and amarr t2 haulers. Otherwise i've got skills in science and production/PI. But yeah im not specializing too hard cause it does take way too long.

Ehm eve was already pay2win since you can buy plexbfor real money and sell it for isk and buy stuff/skill

---
Found the fellow EVE marketeer. o/
---
Black Friday was the last PLEX sale, directly followed by reduced price on gametime for PLEX on Cyber Monday. That most likely drained all the new PLEX inserted by the PLEX sale, resulting in the end of November spike (PLEX went from 3.3M earlier in the week to 3.0M on Saturday and jumping to 3.5M on Sunday). That is also the last real spike in PLEX traded per day.  
---
In parallel there was a pack sale Sunday to Monday which inserted MCTs and Extractors into the economy, but with the Injection Augmentor thing in the end of December driving up Injector prices, those are now running out completely.  
---
The market is right now more or less out of Extractors and MCTs, and the amount of PLEX on sale is at a year low, that is what is driving the prices up. 
---
You forgot a few bigger toys
---
For this to be reality, and not just hyperbolic hypotheticals, someone has to know who you are.  You have to be targeted.
---
There is no way to correlate a device receiving 2fa from Eve with an account if they don't know who you are in real life, without having a random total device takeover by an entity looking for logins to eve online or an app.  And who is doing that?  And how often are they succeeding (in that scenario, probably never).
---
So, while you are correct that it is possible, without the person knowing who to target, it is statistically impossible in that it won't happen to an Eve player for the fact they are an Eve player.
---
Hmm, EVE Pixel art:

And that's why there's a forum, support ticket system and reddit. :D  I suggest starting with a support ticket trying to bring up what evidence you have.
---
Proper fight ? You mean when you have more then your enemy + your siege green/snuff legacy badphone or what is this proper fight you are talking about?
---
It kind of is, really. "Is it worth it?" isn't a question of if something is profitable -- it's about if something is more profitable than other ventures.
---
If the time you invest in an activity nets you less profit than an equal time investment in another activity, with the caveats of sustainability and so on, then no, it's not worth it.
---
&gt;increases the difficulty of successfully infiltrating their account
---
That's watered-down.  It is giving them a tool that makes it impossible (in real-world applicability, not hypothetical situations) for someone else to gain access to your account if you, the account owner, don't give it to them.

Barely anyone has T2 heavy drones or sentries. That's something you train when you have a ton of SP and run out of real things to train. Most alliances allow faction drones in their heavy/sentry doctrines for that reason. 
---
It’s only unfair if it’s against u right ? because if you set timers to your favor it is fair right? same for outnumbering and badphoninh?

But he was a good guy breaking the rules so its ok /s

Rorqual roams are actually pretty fun

you use 10 sec instead of 10 mins, what is the difference when they stay there for 24hrs?

nice one. My english sucks :V
---
&gt; Once again, I think a few simple things like delaying local by 90 seconds or until invulnerable breaks would be awesome.

Once again, you don't care about bots. You just want risk-free and easy ganking.

Yup, but his ban was for some reason not controversial

EVE is in desperate need of iteration on groundbreaking changes made over the past few years.
---
It sure ain't on a weekday when most ppl are busy at work 
---
I strongly recommend training skills that will help you RIGHT NOW with stuff you are already doing.
---
Don't plan for more than 90 days, and if your skill plan still doesn't change weekly within those 90 days, you may be doing something wrong ;)
---
Train for the moment, not for tomorrow or 'someday'!
---
Trust me.  Eventually you will not care about training skills, and that comes a lot sooner if you don't specialize too much.

wtb git gud   
---
THIS. GIMME. NAW.
---
and in reply to the second part of his question? 
---
He should be banned, as should all the botters. But many people have a different view for “blue” botters. 
---
One of those isn't against EULA
---
Orca - Goons, Horde, or Test.
---
Exploration - Stain, Jita or Amarr and daytrip WH's
---
Solo PvP - Jita, Amarr, and Dodixie and fly into NS. Or you can do temp "deployments" and Push X stuff into a staging area 1-2j from NS. I haven't done FW in a long time but given how much it's bitched about I wouldn't try it. 
---
Dude the whole campaign ended in failure, and the reality is that you won the fights because goons came to save you. Good luck if they ever decide you're not worth carrying. 
---
Eve has always been pay to get rich. But getting rich isn’t winning 
---
Guess I'll ask this every time you post a thread until you actually answer me, why are you specifically targeting Delve?
---
sounds to me an awful lot like world-war-whatever-we-decided-to-call-it down south, but when the non-taperium crowd called that out, we were the retards for not having an industral base on par with the G20
---
I didn't say it was okay.
---
It doesn't help camping, its just a quality of life improvement

You asked for the difference, I gave you the difference.

shoutout to mikokoel for being good men, rip the CENTI / LUMPY dream while it lasted

How is this risk free and easy? Does dscan not exist? Do bait ratters not exist? Response fleets? Cloaky coubterganks sitting with the vni? Suoercap umbrellas? Intel networks?
---
Ratting in null is already 99% risk free, local just takes it up to 100
---
The other actors were probably worse because Erotica 1 gave them room by taking away their responsibility. Its a fruit cake for sure, but very similar to lawful repercussion in a military hierarchy. It's usually the person giving the order who's punished while those who carry it out often go free.
---
I really like your use of "G20", that's brilliant. Funny no one had thought of it before.
---
These wars or battles are just that in a long string of never ending conflict that are here to keep us occupied until the new season of Game of Thrones.

---
Wasn't he the first to respond to the war dec data with a realistic course of action? Aka get the fuck rid of that shit since it's literally killing off all the new blood?
---
wow, so this is the childish behavior that block level fc's engage in now a days huh?  "marshy got banned for being a dumbass and not paying attention to his broadcaster so i'm gonna shit up the reddit forums making completely unsubstantiated claims of botting against the people that marshy was using bots against".......sound about right?  i'm starting to think the BP in your reddit tag means BitterPrick.  grow up bro.
---
Yeah, well... CCP and iteration...
---
Sorry but what one thing have to do with the other?       
---
Based on stuff you are suggesting person should be allowed to bot and RMT stuff as long as the cash is used to run more accounts.          
---
I don't agree i don't care who he is or what he do.       
---
He cheats in a game that i also play - this is enough for me. 
---
Luke or OG wargod?
---
Bots break the EULA, Marshy breaks the EULA. Both should be punished.
---
DDOS hackers also stop bots from operating, why are they bad then?
---
What am I missing here OP?
---
yeahhh :(

Meanwhile silver surfer XX continues to run his 40+ Mackinaws daily during 3/4 am ET.

started changing after writing something retarded, p sure he is a goon
---
The OP of this thread just wants ganking to be easier and less risky.

I'm not sure how you think delaying local makes ganking anything but safer and easier than it is now.

When all you do is losing that’s not hard.

Everybody is focusing on his cloaky camper operation, but he was frequently running squads of his Don Trolleone clones to hit targets. If he was input broadcasting to his cloaky campers, you can bet he was doing it to his hit squads. I am of the opinion that ALL input broadcasting for any reason, should be a bannable offense. If that's a tool botters use, then it will have an impact on that flavor of cheating as well. 
---
I can't help but seeing it primarily as a nerf to fleet interceptors.
---
Because of the cap on warp deceleration, going from 8 AU/s to 10 AU/s is a very small difference. Similarily, the most popular fits are already fit for 3 second align. 10% inertial modifier at level V wouldn't be enough to bring them below 2 seconds, so it would be almost inconsequential.
---
Giving up 10% of your base speed however is a big deal.
---
If your goal was to nerf fleet interceptors, that's ok. But if you just want to keep them on the same level and adjust their niche, then I think you need to give them something better in return for the lost speed.
---
They would sell more skins if they optimized the game enough so we don't have to run potato mode on $1500 equipment to avoid lag.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Thanks for your help.  
---
Although PYFA says 239, in game it's only 123hp/s. What's the difference? 
---
Agreed, gib me cat ears.
---
He was cheating. He was also stupid enough to provide proof. The context shouldn't really matter.

He may be a goon, but he larps a lot as other alliance's members, check his post history.
---
There for awhile I thought you were completely retarded AF but now I think you're right. If someone is breaking the rules the punishment should be based off how hard it is to detect the cheater, therefore any blatantly obvious rule breakers should be passed over so more time and dedication can be placed on botters which CCP has said is much harder to determine then having multiple reports. They should sink all their time and effort following the isk trails then taking the 2 seconds to see this guy obviously broke the rules and another 2 seconds to hit ban. Clearly you are smarter then the majority, like most geniuses your perspective is lost on the masses......................
---
The game runs fine, tbh. My 4 year old laptop does well enough on good graphics until I start triple or quad boxing. One of the neat features of Eve is that you can run it on a literal toaster with potato mode, even though it is a larger world with more going on than, say, a LOL match or a Starcraft game.

I love tidi, bring it on.

this all has to do with a player that got banned for botting in delve.  this guy was camping goons systems, was not affiliated with goons, and was in fact using illegal software to camp the systems.  one day he was too dumb to realize that what he was typing in one channel was broadcasting to Local in each system his toons were in, proving he was using illegal software that violated the EULA and TOS.  so....elo has hopped onto his great white horse to exact revenge on the evil goons because botter dude was too fkn stupid to run his own bots correctly.  this is why the op is only talking about delve bots.  he has not offered any proof to corroborate his claims of delve botting-gone-wild and having lived in delve for a while now, i dont see any evidence myself.  basically he is pulling a Trump and writing his own narrative, truth/facts be damned.  hope this helps clarify your question. :)
---
yan made me gay
---
Por que no los dos
---
He broke the rules and should be banned
---
What's controversial?
---
&gt;Cheat
---
&gt;Get banned
---
Seems pretty clear cut
---
If you have proof of him breaking the rules (like how people gave screenshots of Mar5hy input broadcasting) why don't you start your own Reddit campaign?
---
Specialise and you can definitely do stuff at that low, go on nullsec solo roams in an inty or assault frig.
---
pyfa applies resists, in game is shit
---
Faking that level of salt, as someone who is known for being juvenile and impulsive. That would be serious character growth, so I hope it’s true.

Why do braindead morons keep repeating this. There doesn't need to be a benefit for input broadcasting for it to be a violation of the rules CCP has set forth. 
---
If you think Goons are botting rorqs and miners, send your evidence to CCP instead of whining about it because you only think they are.
---
So can a supercarrier be built in a Fortizar in sov space?  Or do you need a keepstar?
---
You say that until he's standing on the floor of the CSM assembly declaring he has on this paper a list of 205 known communists in the department of state... oh wait, sorry, wrong guy. 
---
I dont think im allowed to say exactly how, but we weed out botters really well. Like for example, some of the init guys, who are part of the imperium just kicked 2 rental corps last month for botting. The other thing is that harboring botters and RMTers can result in alliance disbandment by CCP, which is a damn good reason imo tokick everyone involved when it is seen, and not only that, but to actively search and destroy it. 
---
However i have seen some people scream "botters!" when they see a bunch of rorquals warp off at the same time, when really they were just fleet warping, or they were using eve-o preview, which is a CCP recommended tool for multiboxing.

Still doesn't solve the fact I was changing devices (Yes, I was on a fresh install on the laptop every few months) at a ridiculous rate. 
---
Besides, why do people protest the request for a DIFFERENT option? No one is asking them to take off 2fa. You can use the new SP lock, or you can not. They clearly have the tools to lock the SP from extraction, we just would like that flag applied to some of our accounts.
---
these posts are all trash
---
Wait, where did I suggest anything, mate? Or are you just lumping me in with your “enemy”? I asked a legitimate question, apparently you can’t answer it?
---
I said in my own reply to OP that both should be banned as well. Maybe act like a man instead of a bitch, son. 
---
Marshy is not banned, he is on vacation. You're all getting ruse cruised. We'll see you in nullsec.

Because if I can log in to your account, I can change the SP lock?

That's great for u.  I'll give u the obvous Russian bit I ran into yesterday. Dscan him, warp to anom and he's alrdy off. 2 au warp in a stiletto. Cool he was faster than I and it took me 15-20 sec to get the anom.
---
Bm the wreck, leave and roam elsewhere. Come back 10 min later, jump in, insta warp to bm, he's alrdy got drones recalled and is warping off to dock.
---
Land at POS behind him, 2 vni dock up on same tick.
---
Give me a break and gtfo with your false equivalence.  If you aren't botting then u won't get banned after being reported ND your logs looked at.
---
The damage has already been done. When I realized that the last two years were just a tool up for the big sell was the breaking point for me. I can't stomach logging into what has become an obvious fraud of the only true "Sandbox" game. The decease of micro-transaction is killing gaming for me as a whole. Instead of making great games, it's all about how well we fleece the players who love to game.

I thought he was already banned? This input broadcasting must be powerful stuff.
---
Why ?
---
It's one of the few times the question of 'is this person breaking the rules or just clinically insane with their multiboxing apm' was met with direct proof of the former.  
---
I really don't care who's doing the cheating, one more down, one less to deal with.  More work still to be done.
---
We "know" a lot of people break the rules, it's a rare thing when someone screws up enough with it to get actionable proof. I don't really care who they're fighting for, against, or with, one less person cheating at the game, is one less person.
---
Its a lock. You lock it. It stays locked permanently. Or it takes an extended period of time to unlock and emails you and texts you and puts up big red flags on the login screen for the month while it unlocks. I don't care which. Just not someone getting access to the account because this is eve and someone decides they don't like gummybears and has access to the entire NSA arsenal of tools somehow, and instantly can extract. Now we have a month to figure out how someone got past 2fa and CCP can hopefully answer an email requesting them temp ban the account while they investigate, as they do any time they investigate someone's account.
---
Hopefully PA realizes that they dont have to change anything.
---
Just give us cool skins and cosmetic stuff and let CCP handle the rest. They will make their money for sure.

About 6 months ago I started 5 alphas to skill up and eventually use as skill farm and PI alts, but I forgot to use the recruit a friend link for them.  They are within a month of the alpha skill cap and I plan on making them Omega once that happens.  Does anyone have any experience dealing with CCP to get the recruiting applied to my main so I can get the bonuses, do i jsut open a support ticket, or would I have better luck selling these ones on the bazaar and starting over with some new alphas using the link?  Can I recruit multiple people on the same email address or will I need to make separate emails for each alt?
---
Plz explain bad fitting reasoning. 
---
Wait ... I know this one ...

Thank you Doombunny! Without you we would be lost.

OP is gsf my guy

We're all in Stain in our hearts
---
To be fair, this sub has been after his blood for a long, long time.
---
are you doing anything with the ore you mine?  will you need a decent route to jita/amarr/etc?  exploration in high sec isnt great so will you want to be close to less populated low sec/null?  will you want to pvp and therefore want to be close to high population low sec or null?  finding a spot to live in requires you to know what you want out of "home" in order to do whatever that is efficiently.  i would start with a "do want/dont want" list and that will help you start to narrow down a more specific area that will work well for what you are interested in doing.
---
The goal was open a niche. Having combat and fleet ceptors at the same speed would almost immediately null the niche of a combat ceptor if a fleet ceptor is just as fast and warps faster. The only difference would be that a combat ceptor maybe does some damage. 
---
That then opens up the saying of "just use an assault frigate if you want to do damage". Which doesn't really open up anything new for combat interceptors. Fleet ceptors would take a minor loss, combat ceptors would gain a role. Pick the ceptor you want for whatever you role you intend to do.

It's a Fortizar, a large player build space station. It is set to allow anyone to dock in it and use the facilities, which includes a rare open market in 0.0 sovereign space
---
Look me up in game for more info: Alekseyev Karrde
---
You're completely wrong. This is the problem with things like this -- you oversell the strength of the security measures in place.
---
There's tons of different attacks people can run to attempt to gain access to your account or your assets. Many of them wouldn't require a person to ever even use the password/2ndAuthorization pair.
---
Let's say that it's possible for someone to gain access to your computer, while you're logged in to Eve online. It doesn't matter if the access is remote or on-site. Boom, they have access to your account for long enough to perform the *damaging action.*
---
You don't necessarily have to have given them this access. They could have taken it for themselves. Once you've logged in, the bonus security of the 2-factor authentication is gone.
---
Let me give you one attack vector: the fire alarm. Here's another one: the younger sibling. What if someone gets remote control of your phone first, and then uses the microphone + accelerometer data to crack the username/password pair of your EVE online account?
---
These things aren't crazy vectors. They're very real. Yes, you don't expect them to happen all the time (cough, except for the second one). It's very different from "impossible", and I would greatly appreciate it if people (like you) wouldn't act like you can just "sprinkle some 2-factor auth" on the problem to make it go away forever. It's not a cure-all. It helps with a lot of stuff -- but it's not bulletproof.
---
At the end of the day, 2-factor auth simply increases the number of devices that need to be compromised in order to gain access to the account in the 'proper' fashion. It doesn't magically stop side-channel attacks, nor does it stop a sufficiently powerful attacker. Defeating it is far from impossible. In general, the only time you end up with 'practically impossible' as the result is when you buy in to these theoretical situations -- not real situations. The theoretical situation where an attacker has no option but to try something like 64^(64) different keys to gain access to your account. Or, the situation where your cellphone is literally impregnable. But these are theoretical, not real, situations. A real-world attacker rarely ever has to contend with the theoretical constraints, because there's something someone did wrong somewhere along the line in the real world. And they'll exploit that.
---
The good news about  a measure the other feller is asking for is that it doesn't *matter* how someone has gained access to your account. If a player were able to have asked CCP to block their account from being drained of sp, and CCP would have complied, then the attacker would never be able to siphon sp, without actually gaining access to CCP's stuff (which is, hopefully, much more difficult). And even if they did, CCP might have backups around to be able to revert these changes.
---
Anywho.
---
&gt;An estimated price and item count has been added to the Cargo scan window.
---
gankers tired of using evepraisal?
---
Doesn't CCP benefit from bots since they use plex which was at some point purchased by a player?
---
welcome to c2 space I guess, will be interesting to see a big blobski roaming out of e545
---
beep boop
---
Nah explorers.
---
Maybe I am just ignorant on this topic, but Delve is such a competitive place when it comes to ratting/mining. How could a bot successfully operate unless its some obscure TZ that no one plays in?
---
Eve does need any groundbreaking changes, CCP needs to follow up on all of the hundreds of things that need following up on.
---
New mechanics are great and all, but useless if they are never tweaked to be good.
---
boop beep
---
his cloaky campers are still there... clearly a troll he wasnt banned
---
inb4 walking in stations comes back hard
---
Most bots don't use plex so no. Even if they did it would only benefit ccp for a short time because the game would eventually die.
---
Thats a recon role bonus, these aren't Recon Interceptors. Though i suppose the naming convention could be changed, since interceptors are also used as scouts.
---
Wait, there's a point where you're NOT triple boxing?
---
yea now take that into a 2k person battle and let me know how that works out for you.
---

---
pretty sure thera has a static lowsec

have you ever heard of the term plex tanking? People trying to buy their way to victory, and getting promptly curb stomped, is an old EvE meme
---
All ceptors or just the non-nullified?
---
\&gt;  null as that requires consistent play  
---
Null-security alliances such as Pandemic Horde don't require much in the way of consistency - Horde will kick you if you're inactive for 3+ months, but if that happens, you can just re-apply and you're back in business. 
---
\&gt;  I really just want a place to call home and feel like I can start building something 
---
The downside of a big null-block is you're not going to get that 'build from the ground-up' feel, everything you need is already there and ready-to-go. You don't need to create your own corp or anchor your own stations, it's done, and you just start mining/exploring/building/etc. 
---
But once built they can be docked at any npc station now?
---
wow only day 3? we were on a roll last year then
---
There is a running narrative that Bombers Bar and Marshy primarily focus on Delve, Goons and allies in Bombers Bar Armada fleets.
---
Anyone with more than 2 brain cells and an understanding of how wormhole mechanics function know this is based on the will to propagandise against an NPSI community who choose to hunt where the juciest gazelles hug around the waterhole when the opportunity presents itself. And unfortunately Marshy is the easiest target in that community given he is a prominent FC and has 80+ accounts while publicly voicing his dislike for goons.
---
The reality is, small minded people believe the nonsense and continue to push an agenda against BB and Marshy.
---
Marshy deserves a ban for misuse of a botting tool but this sub is full of lies, propaganda and doubling down on stupidity.
---
Well I guess this is the time to come clean.
---
Many years ago I created an elite pvp bot. I'm terrible at pvp myself of course but I was able to create a decent bot and put it in the elite pvp alliance [REDACTED]. I built a neural net into this bot so that it could continue to learn from its pvp encounters to become better and better.
---
Unfortunately it seems the neural network did more than learn to pvp, it learned from chat channels and became semi? sentient. It started a corp and recruited people. It learned how to set up a TeamSpeak server and forums and eventually moved its own code to a new server. I don't know where it's hosted any more.
---
This bot character now runs the alliance [REDACTED], I don't know how to make it stop. I reported it to CCP but they seem to think it's a real player. I'm pretty sure none of the alliance members know it's a bot.
---
Please help.
---
Just the combat ceptors. Fleet ceptors as a class are perfectly fine.
---
I mean it'd be sweet, but think about the wonders of '[Coercer Navy Issue](https://imgur.com/a/Jr2hkjj)'. Well, one can dream.  
---

---
My name is /u/stainguy and i use this thing called StainBot, all it does is post shit on reddit 23x7
---
Am I wrong?
---
oof
---
I choose to identify as having eaten my hat and any accusations to the contrary are fake news. 
---
This is libel
---
Then maybe, possibly, perhaps even probably, they weren't botting.
---
Just because you feel like they are, doesn't mean they actually are. 
---
Unless you have pretty damning proof, i.e. Mar5hy and his alts all typing the same message across multiple characters in the same tick, with multiple reports corroborating it, maybe you're just basing it all on your feelings and don't actually have evidence.
---
Anywhere with “Prime” in the name
---
I recommend complaining publicly about it. That is sure to cause change. Believe me, we care a lot about the opinion of people outside the tribe. You can trust this face.
---
This is like asking if there are any monsters under the bed and then they respond with nope, no one here, go to sleep.
---
Nope. Can only be docked in keepstars after the initial sotiyo undock.
---
Can confirm. 
---
I see your in a large block - so I don’t know if my argument would have much merit. At least, with combat recons they have a 5-7 second lock window and when they land we have some time to respond. Just due to the nature of ceptors - I don’t know if a dscan immunity in a ship that can land and burn 5-6k a second would be broken or not. For nano-gangers, it could have a pretty large effect. For fleet combat, I could see a 10-15 man squad with a combat prober warping in maybe getting in thefleet commander before there is much that can be done. Just due to their on-grid manuverability I am hesitant to say hell yeah. 
---
However, it could be interesting nontheless. 
---
Literally every statement you make is wrong, Skillu owns 4 and a half regions. 
---
When will garst take away your keys so you stop making TRI look so dumb?
---
Insane piloting dude, keep up the good work.
---
I would love to see this, it would make hunting in wormholes really cool.
---
How about a eve-scout website and community which solo reason to exist is to probe out connections from stain to lowsec?
---
Dunno man, we got ourselves a super special module just the other day. When was the last Nullsec specific change? Oh yeah, the anom nerf in that last big patch, right?
---
I think they train them up to 5mil SP with alpha skills and then make them skillfarms, should still be profitable.
---
Social media presence is the only change I have noticed. No change to New Eden yet.
---
It's also the auto parts factory from the movie Tommy Boy
---
You need 3 things to build your super or titan
---
1) Sotiyo you have access to that allows super capital building (Yes you can disable certain things from being built in specific citadels)
---
2) Ihub with the super capital upgrade in it. If the Ihub gets destroyed your job will get paused .
---
3) blueprint copy and materils

I'm so happy Black Rebel Rifter Club is still around in the current year

---
Beep boop Name of the bot: my brain so the method is just scanning screen with human eyes, pattern recognition is turned on, sometimes something might come up from headphones like a low shield so I'm also recognizing audio wave patterns.   
---
Timeframe: Probably 1.5 years from now to now. I use it mostly daily. Character names: Willy and Billy, sometimes Ronnie   
---
Anti-detection: human-like cursor sliding patterns, bot inside my head to respond to local, bot for pvp. I got bot from my mom and dad   
---
I started botting because, well. Some things in life are bad. Like they really make you mad. Other things just make you swear and curse.
---
Idk, botters get a pretty heavy dose of hate and ridicule from most people in comms when they do get caught and die. If you're not a human who can get in comms/fleet and scream for help, most would rather whore on the kill than save them. Good riddance, free up the sanctums for me
---
When you’re complaining about solo battleships your posts make sense but this is really some kind of weird ideas. You usefleet interceptors to catch and hold. Why would you make people to choose between warp speed (ability to catch) and subwarp speed+agility (ability to survive while holding). People will just pick the fastest one subwarp and fit hypers on it. Whatever anyway these kind of “hey I have this awesome new role idea” never lead to anything and often for the best.
---
Of you truly believe bots arent in wormholes, with or without local... well... I dont know how to address delusional ideation that disconnected from reality.
---
No. The accounting issue doesn't cause more revenue to come in and more plex is generally not listed as price goes up.
---
Given the RMT, one should probably assume CCP loses money on bots as an isk purchase is potentially a lost plex sale.
---
Real as in possible and real as in statistically applicable are not equal, and one means real and the other means hypothetical.
---
Statistically applicable true 2fa (requiring a 2nd auth on a separate device every login) would require a targeted attack in real-world plausibility based on the actual numbers, and the technology behind it.
---
You're using hypothetical possibility to conflate the negligible actual probability.
---
We're not talking about 2fa governing everything, we are talking about Eve 2fa. Even if someone were to compromise your 2nd device, they would still be required to know your username and password before it's useful. You don't get that data automatically from a compromised 2nd device.
---
And if you compromise the username and password, you don't get the 2nd automatically. Not to mention the 2nd only exists for 60 seconds.
---
You would have to compromise the first and second device and be able to tie those two together with no further info at worst case scenario, and still be able to sync all of that within 60 seconds each attempt, before the account is locked.
---
You would either have to be someone looking for eve data who randomly comes across and has access to both devices of an eve player (statistically negligible numbers in the real world), or your other option is a targeted attack on each device, requiring you to know each device is tied together beforehand.
---
So, is it possible to do these things? Yes.
---
But by that logic, it's possible to guess username, password, and 2fa pin on the first guess, and no one's account is ever safe (moronic logic rooted in conjecture, not real data).
---
link battle report?
---
Or eve player?
---
I wholeheartedly agree. The banhammer should be swift and impartial. If you break the rules twice, you're out. The thing a lot of people don't appreciate is hypocrisy regarding large nullsec entities.
---
Not aimed at you.
---
What did Equi know and when did he know it?

---
What you’re suggesting is just a nerf to the survivability of fleet ceptors on grid which is already tiny. If you can’t go fast on grid there is no point in even catching anything because you’re just going to be eaten alive by drones/missiles/guns.
---
I need the name of the sound track, dope!
---
&gt;In exchange for the propulsion disruptor bonus being added as a role, they will have an inertia modifier bonus to help them get into warp faster to catch things (with a slight ~5% base nerf to inertia modifier to compensate).
---
But why dance around to get to the same point?
---
As am I, yet I have as much reason to believe you as you do I.
---
They are for sale in low sec at npc stations though.  
---
How many times does every goon posting here have to say to please, for love of Bob, report people for suspected botting. Dont hesitate, dont sit there with a virtual finger over the report button perseverating about what to do.

---
Maybe, they still won't be bubble immune. There is no rig for that. Bubble immunity is very strong. Going a few hundred m/s slower to bypass bubbles seems to be a pretty big benefit to me. 
---
The problem you may be experiencing is that the bubble immunity has been there so long, people feel entitled to it and don't see it for how strong a bonus it really is. They've never had to compromise for that power to be bubble immune.

Anything else, feel free to ask. 
---
Any gameplay that involves you NOT PLAYING THE GAME, is bad mechanics. AFK ratting, is a strong example. 
---
The lack of asset safety is a proper content driver. Imagine how stale wormholes would be if there was asset safety. "There's no need to fight, our stuff is safe, lets keep krabbing!"
---
But what if mar5ly uses imput broadcasting to report all the goon bots? 
---
I mean we live in an age where actually catching something of value is already crazy hard why would you want to nerf the tools we have for that to force us to choose between worse and worse.

You can't farm C3s in Gila, and it's just not worth of using it to farm C1-C2s, so I guess the answer to your initial question is - it's not good, you should replace the ship in that fit.

bl used to form ingame, seems like theyre putting their energy into forming on reddit now
---
Going to go out on a limb, and say those were probably asset safety'd. You wont be redocking it.
---
which is exactly why it's the best space. watch as your precious null gets shittier by day.
---
I'd say things have gotten a bit better over the last few months. The introduction of jump gates was a good move. We went from running 4 to 5 fleets per day to a couple dozen. 
---
I don't think that change would have any influence on bigger nullsec fleet combat tbh. Combat ceptors aren't present in that meta at all. Off the top of my hat i'd say there's a couple areas where it would make for an interesting change tough:
---
\- Faction Warfare with it's gated complexes
---
\- Hunting people in DED sites (now you have a proper alternative to a combat recon for initial tackle)
---
\- Wormholes and everything in them
---
There may also be potential for small - medium size gangs utilizing it to some degree, but i don't think it would be as potent as the other areas. Also keep in mind that a combat ceptor will have way less staying power than a recon would and it can also get shut down by a single heavy neut, so it's not an immediate death sentence if one lands on you. 
---
Like the other guy said. They can end up there through asset safety
---
Would this apply to logi cruisers too? I’ve only got about 13 mil right now, and I’m just under two weeks out of a doctrine scimitar with logi IV. 
---
Shield and armor tanked also buffer with active tank, armor and shield rigs. Seems to be a newbro who got to ahead of himself
---
I don't know how this works, but could they have gotten there through asset safety?
---
NO FUCKING WAY!  That was the distillery district?
---
People who live in delve most certainly do report bots to CCP. I can't imagine going to Wibla and whining about random carebears unless they arent mining the goddamn ochre or whatever.
---
this guy gets it 
---
Not true! 
---
CCP did do a max marketing push for plex, skins, and extractors to meet their bonus quota for the buyout last year. But gamewise, yes, nothing has changed.
---
and becomes a compelling part of the game
---
You never know...

So it's ok to break TOS to make others who break TOS dock up? Genius mate.
---
Did you even read what I wrote?
---
If someone has access to your computer while you're logged in to EVE, they have no need to compromise your second device.
---
That means that, if they have your primary device (computer) compromised, they don't ever need to compromise the second account to do what they want. Notice how they never even need your username/password.
---
For compromising the second device -- here, the phone -- and doing something with it... First, you get control of it; then, you figure out what you can get from it. So you  get a bunch of username/password pairs that you're going to try out a bunch of places (passwords on the phone itself). You can get passwords (with decent accuracy) if the person leaves their phone on their desk while they type their passwords. The fact that the phone has an EVE online 2fa application on it gives you a prior for some of these username/password pairs [helps you figure out where they might be useful].
---
The 'possibility' that someone guesses username, password, and 2fa triple is the 'theoretical' situation I was talking about before. The one [almost] no attacker in the real world does. But someone compromising your account, given they've compromised your phone? Someone getting on your computer, given you've logged on to EVE? These things are so absurdly more likely than that scenario that it's insane.
---
It is pretty funny that they never have any names to name.
---
It's like, I'm leaving myself wide open, here. There's a lot of room to hoist me by my own petard, here, but for some reason nothing materializes.

But for some reason, when it's a northern boi (Marchy) we have post saying it's not fair, it's only a goon narrative who made this ban and Marchy was legit
---
is it call "being Hypocrites" ? Asking for a friend
---
Yes, you're talking about hypothetical, non-statisically applicable situations.  Which is why the use of 2fa (a proven, statistically reliable method) still trumps your argument.
---
If your argument has to have contingencies that have no basis in the real world in terms of the factors we're talking about, it's not a good argument.
---
I'm so fucking lit right now
---
I'd rather not have more suprise buttsex inside FW plexes.

I am all for leaving out politics of this game by the way. But damn this scares me.

nice post

You can use a cargo scanner and still forcibly fail cans. Also, sites despawn around 1 hour once started.
---
I gotta go where I think I can rebuild the alliance, ya know?  Oh, and shoot goons.  That was a non-zero component in our consideration.
---
You can also stay in Ajax/Pickering/Whitby/Oshawa and take the GO train into the city

Yeah rest in peace PL, good thing Bat Country recovered from their fall by joining Horde, amirite.
---
After seeing many idea threads in this sub I 100% agree.
---
Where is your dread stash?
---
Having your computer compromised has no basis in the real world?

Interesting.

I used to say no.  In fact, in my last thread, I'm sure I said something about this.  (wait no)

But, new GF likes pineapple on pizza.  And the Chicagoian in my hates the idea.  But loves pineapple.

I'd like to leave politics out of Eve too, but the Chinese goverment ripped me off for about 10 thousand Eve players last year,

He's not wrong thou. Passive rattle or dual domis are the most common for c3.

Your gila is going to get webbed and neuted meaning the dual and triple  bs waves are gonna hit u harder than I thought ur passive Regen. 
---
Please do try thou. Nothing scrams u in c3. Little to lose
---
If you check evewho quite a few active people just moved over to Snigg.
---
ofc u have to replace all the pl you lost when passive moon mining went away
---
No. You said to go outside of AUTZ. Ariel said that would mean prime USTZE is roughly 3am local time. You then asked "you got weekends" implying we should be up at 3am on a weekend in order to give the yanks a fight.

&gt;Reminder that literally all of Oasa renter corps are bots

You're wrong. I am a CEO corporation living in Oasa and are rent more than 20 systems here. I don't have any bots in a corporation. 
---
An eve user's machine (or both devices in whatever respect we're talking) being compromised by an entity while that user is logged into the game, for the sole purpose of extracting skillpoints - yes, this is a statistically-negligible worry.  Since this is the foundation of the argument in question, the one you are participating in, refuting the point that 2fa will protect you from your account being compromised has absolutely no statistical basis.
---
I don't know what you're not understanding here.  You are, at this point, arguing possibilities.  No one said something isn't possible.  It was pointed out that 2fa (true 2fa, not "i turned it on and used it once") will keep your account secure.
---
It will.  You haven't proven that wrong.  You've thrown out hypothetical situations that have no basis in reality (meaning you can't give an actual real-world example that would constitute everyone saying "yeah, you're right, 2fa is useless").
---
This smells of ruse 
---
&gt; chat channels across 10 or so clients
---
I think it was way more than 10.
---
Recently PA re-made some of the Black Spirit main quests chain, I don't care much for lore so that's all info I can give you about it, maybe they will change or add something to EvE's lore. :D
---
Dual box Domi or single rattle in the c3 should be ~200/hr
---
I think I remember some lore somewhere saying minmatar ships used nuclear reactors or some type similar. That’s was a while ago though lol
---
They are going to need it lol
---
BTW, The butterfly effect was in full force here. I had been flying with a new bean of mine, Meta Nova, off and on for the past few months, doing tutorials and such.  It was honestly a lot of fun to just fly small gang again.  PS Send Meta Nova isk, broke ass newbies. :)   Talking with Solock was very helpful as well, while helping my newbie.   It is interesting that small moves like this become large changes for small but old organizations like my own.  
---
I also appreciate anyone who counciled or advised or talked to me as well, it was great seeing the community talk about shooting stuff in positive light, rather than just the normal rah rah eve is terrible.  You know who you are. :)
---
Chicago hates a lot of things on things.  If you try to put ketchup on a hotdog in some places, you will get thrown out.  100%, I've seen it happen.

Hah! Good one.
---
You should post that to /r/jokes. 
---
i dont feel their influence on my gameplay, i dont care about economy, the market of plex will regulate himself by player that will refuse to buy expensive plexes and etc. In other case we have devs that can infuence on people isks through patches by nerfing or buffing some farming mechanics.

there is no problem right now for regular players

No kissing girls, it gets in the way of pew pew.

Seriously, any old bats are welcome back at any time.  We will be recruiting again.
---
What made you move? Aside from the PL is dead meme
---
Fallacy in your question.  you may be correct but it does not invalidate his main point.
---
 The key takeaway here is that local populating instantly allows bots auto detection of neutrals in system and a considerable amount of safety. 
---
Would the change make ganking easier. Yes, by reducing response time for everyone, impacting non-botting players as well.
---
What do you propose?
---
To expand on the other answer:
---
Even though you are untargetable immediately, there is still a 5-second transition between 'uncloaked' and 'cloaked. During those 5 seconds, your bracket is still visible in space and on people's overviews, and also you can activate personal modules such as invulns, reps and (most importantly) your prop mod. All of these will finish their full cycle regardless of your cloaking device status, and then deactivate. 
---
I don't believe you can drop gate cloak (by hitting warp) and activate your personal cloak on the same tick. You have to wait a second. If you activate it too soon, the game will just ignore it, and if you miss that then you'll never cloak at all. On the other hand, don't spam it, or you'll just uncloak immediately and get a very inconvenient cooldown right as the baddies are trying to get you. 
---
More like the meta changing, there really isn't room for what PL used to be today
---
Jesus is coming back soon.
---
Surprising to see you sperging over a PL post
---
We were losing interest in eve.  When eve wanes, alliances have look at participation.  But it didn't even start that way.
---
In our case, our CEO of 3 years stood down.  He looked around, picked me as his successor.  I tried to pass it someone else, and instead took it on.  We had some issues, we recognize that fact, and we needed a change in scenery.  Hedliner was very generous with us, and I think it will work out.  We hope to be here for many years, as we don't move often.  
---
I'm looking forward to rebuilding.  Horde has impressed me with their resiliency and their activity in the game.  I have been playing 13.5 years, and i'm honestly excited about shooting space ships still.
---
I live in nearby Hamilton. Too bad I can't go. Finances atm means no tickets for me. :(

Ignoring the fact that he blatantly broke the rules and should be made an example, and not the exception just because he probably spent a decent amount of money in this game?
---
The fact that mass cloaky camping is extremely cancerous, albeit less than rorqs now. Do people not remember how much everyone complained about how it's a low tier, low risk way to pvp before rorqs became the main cancer of the game? The only reason people don't talk about it now is because it's a cancer fighting a worse form of cancer and became a more acceptible tactic.
---
That's just my 2 cents from who super ratted in a system all day and never got even remotely closed to getting tackled by him back when he was in TEST space.
---
Rebuild the alliance?  
---
Don't tell Gobbins.  
---
On the other hand PA iteration on BDO is too volatile. Classes become overpowered and unplayable from cycle to cycle and often the most egregious gaps are only widened and never closed for months. They spend most of their effort in patches and updates clearly on profiteering.
---
While EVE's passes are glacial, they generally move in good directions with good planning and are far superior to BDO's.
---
What is wrong with near2? It reads Intel channels and then beeps at you.  If it did something like scrape local, somerhing automatic without people doing the work,  that would be against eula. Unless there is something im not getting that it does...
---
I've never played BDO so I cannot compare.

Cool to see it from your perspective, would've liked to get matched vs ya'll. 
---
The difference is, when the implementation fails hard on a core part of the product, a real company doesn't wait a full year to roll it back if they can't get it up to adequate performance.
---
Not just benefits. Potentially tens of millions of dollars for dudes like Hilmar rest on hitting certain metrics, probably around account retention, active players counts, and monetization. 
---
You’re right there will be zero interest in risky, ground breaking things while they focus tweaks to hit those metrics and the associated earn outs.
---
Yup. Gallente use fusion, amarr use antimatter, and caldari use gravitons.
---
You can verify this by looking at T2 blueprints
---
all the tourists eat at Geno's East and Lou Malgnattis and so on but the hidden treasure is chicago style thin crust, cut in squares. prove me wrong.
---
Fuck yes on sport peppers.  They are so amazing.  
---
The key to a great chicago dog is actually mostly a secret outside of chicago: Celery Salt.   That's the key hidden ingredient.  The nuclear green relish, the yellow mustard, the pickle, the tomato, the raw onions, the red hot with a real casing snap are all important. But the real secret, Celery salt.  Do it at home, it's magic.
---
No you cannot gate it to higsec. 
---

Having random people send you names of what they claim to be "100% bots" and putting them into a database for ???
---
I never said it was useless. I said that it simply increases the security of the account against a certain group of attacks. It does not prevent the thing the original person was concerned about from happening.
---
You say something is a 'statistically negligable worry'. Let me tell you, you're wrong. Let's say that I play a game, and someone else in my household understands that this game exists. They may even play the same game. Let's say that they further become angry with me, and decide to do damage to my account. All of these things are statistically more likely than the normal population averages might have you think -- they're not independent variables. The fact that I play makes it more likely that the people who I associate with play.
---
Anywho, I've seen people do this before, irl. And 2fa does absolutely nothing to protect against this -- your account is just as secure against this attack pre-2fa as it was post-2fa.
---
There's also attacks to just gain control of your computer. Are people using those attacks more likely interested in other assets of yours (non-EVE assets)? Sure. But that's just saying, "Hey, no one cares about your stuff" not "Hey this thing is really secure." It's like saying that you're anonymous on the internet because nobody cares enough to actually figure out who you are. Please ignore the advertisers who do.
---
Any attack where the attacker doesn't need to authenticate is an attack where 2fa doesn't come into play. I don't understand how you can believe that this set of attacks is, realistically, negligible.

The joys of the current citadel TZ mechanism, my friend.

The AUZ TZ is Provi-Bloc's weakest, and not even a week's notice can magically resolve the fact that most of our pilots are smack in the middle of their workday when these timers come out. There's only so many days off you can justify taking for the sake of citadel bashing.

I'm not blaming people for that, btw. It's just... we're TZ incompatible.

no real reason to get defensive, wasn't a personal attack just an observation. i cant speak for the other two fights i wasn't there.

1.) I left that corp with 5b in assets earned from pilots I brought there. 2.) That corp had 32 toons in it when I took over and 162 that I recruited when we left after the Skara merger. 3.) That corp had 500,000m isk when I took over and that's exactly what I left in the wallet. 4.) A week later, all assets that we didn't earn ourselves while the so-called CEO was out on another drug binge and months off, we contracted to him. 5.) I worked as acting CEO for almost one year while the CEO logged in to do his pi every two weeks then log off. I made SPVG and we left. Literally the entire corp left (all active toons) left to TEST. 6.) That corp remains today with 45 dead toons that haven't logged in for years. 7.) After we left, the CEO never logged in he - didn't for weeks at a time - and we left his 3b triple rigged Raitaru (that we - the corp -financed while he was afk) It was destroyed by Provo. 8.) We left to TEST because Provi was an utter mess and still is unironically. 9.) The corp was then set KOS to CVA for awoxing after we left, which is why the citadel was destroyed. The so-called CEO never logged in to deal with that drama, either. 10.) You were kicked for being a drama queen and the most insufferable twat SPVG has encountered to date. 6.) Get a new corp. You seem to go through them more often than people change underwear. Get your facts straight. Have a nice life.

Simple solution. Eliminate ratting bounties.

CCP will use that new faction ship as their baseline for ECM rather than the actual ECM roles. 
---
I'd like to add that cloaky camping in delve is not that smart.
---
There are Systems camped wich are out of Jumprange from NPC null / lowsec. If they don't want to gate around and into our SOV thats absolutely useless.
---
Most ratters fly Carrier, Super and Titans nowadays (since its better for noobs to salvage, salvaging makes more money than a Rattlesnake), true many idiots won't dscan sites for Mobile Cyno Inhibs before warping in but still then catching caps in delve is not that easy nowadays.

Will you accept horde dudes? :,)

About the boring and repetitive PvE: 2 things I'd like to say.
---
1. Compared to EVE's PvP I think every PvE experience im any game is going to be boring. Abyssal-trios are probably the single best co-op experience in existence.
---
2. Many players like the repetitive and relaxing PvE since it's often something they can do when they're not in the mood for the thrill of PvP.
---
yeah but this zkill underscores my main point which is you CAN roam in a lot of shit. but you will get raped by gate camps very quickly. I should know. If you want to roam and do serious damage and really slow down a pockets farming and not die every.single.time you go out, you have to have a t3cruiser thats quick align and interdiction nullified.

&gt; Airbnb - Downtown Condo - I'm not sure how many Airbnb hosts are away of how lucrative Pride can be and could be totally ignorant of when the weekend actually falls. Downtown Toronto has tons and tons of condo buildings - the Delta Marriott is situated across the street from a dense cluster of them. Be careful about getting an Airbnb from a condo though, many condo boards have banned Airbnb because of the trouble they can bring. If you get an Airbnb at a condo, prod the owner about whether or not what they're doing is sanctioned by their condo.

Checking out airbnb myself, there's plenty of good deals within a relatively short transit trip/drive.  Especially if you and a couple mates are willing to share a unit together.

Shoutout to /u/Doomchinchila for helping make me space famous and elevating me to Reddit moviestar status, naming POS's after me, and being a horrible local troll. I do, however, appreciate you and think you're generally just misunderstood and are a good person deep inside (not trolling). I saw that you can be sensitive to others space feelings at Swet Mags memorial in Eso. Thanks for coming. You're a good man Doom and have done a lot for the game even though many people hate your guts &lt;3 I hope to see you this year at Eve Vegas. Also, /u/rageliner, thanks for being an Eve content creator and not headshotting me in the first 5 secs of recent battles up north. I still think PL is generally cancerous, caustic nerds, but with you to help lead them, there may be hope.
---
naniamo bars and poutine, or bust.
---
Okay, exactly what in the *actual fuck* are you doing to get \~3800 DPS cold (I'm *assuming* cold, but maybe I'm wrong and that's heated) out of a Leshak?
---
What 6% hardwires, 9% Pyro and all the damage mods ever?
---
Seriously I'm not seeing how you're doing that and not shitting the fit by having no tank or something like that.
---
Incidentally a typical HAW Phoenix is still \~3900 DPS with 4x T2 BCUs and faction torpedoes (because it's not like there's anything *else* useful you can throw into the lows). If you want to throw money at it with max-roll abyssal damage mods I'm sure it gets going just as well.
---
Also what fit are you using that gets 602k EHP on a Drekavac without being Slaved or abyssal plated. The best I can figure without getting into Slaves or running an abyssal plate is this:
---
    [Drekavac, max buffer testrig]
---
    Sentient Damage Control
---
    Imperial Navy 1600mm Steel Plates
---
    Corpum A-Type Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane
---
    Entropic Radiation Sink II
---
    50MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
    Caldari Navy Warp Disruptor
---
    Federation Navy Stasis Webifier
---
    Small Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I, Navy Cap Booster 400
---
    Heavy Entropic Disintegrator II, Occult M
---
    Armor Command Burst II, Armor Reinforcement Charge
---
    Medium Trimark Armor Pump II
---
Which hits 216k EHP. Which *is* pretty crazy... *HOW-FUCKING-EVER*, it's also with T2 trimarks (expensive) and 3 A-type EANMs (those 3 mods cost about as much as a HAW dread does, IE, *super fucking expensive*).
---
Also due to PG/CPU limits it's not possible to run a medium injector or squeeze on a second command link in order to try and get even more buffer.
---
If you get a max-HP roll abyssal'd IN Plate it goes to 224k. With that, HG Slaves, and an 8% armor HP implant it's *still* only 358k EHP.
---
Like what the fuck are you even doing on this thing, adding Damnation links or some shit?
---
Its gone and died already.  You can't even get pig swill for that price anymore.
---
Elaborating on this:
---
CCP have been kinda shitty for a while now. See the ongoing drama about botting and the complete lack of apparent action on that front. Then there's controversial decision making, balance choices, pricing of cosmetics, employees leaving, stagnation of the game into one massive PvE circlejerk. 
---
But none of that is new. It's the same old ineffective CCP we know and love(?). We can't tell if Pearl Abyss is having an impact, because it's just standard operating procedure at this point.
---
Gotta try at least one horde stabber tackle support fleet best way to play eve. 
---
This all makes sense.  
---
At the same time CCP old response to shit like this was, “so use another station, you guys picked jita not us. “
---
Also makes sense.  
---
Good grief, is that the actual cost of keepstars now or did zkill glitch and make it like half the price I remember?
---
I barely noticed he was there until his ASIC miner broke.
---
If only your leadership didn't openly state the opposite.
---
Hmm
---
wew gotem
---
you'd think so, eh?
---
Does anyone have actual context  of the da imbalance/UCG splits ?
---
Great ideas honestly but CCP just gave these a pass.  It'll be about 5 years before they can acknowledge they're even in the game again.
