Now multiply that by 10, 15, 20. People have played this game a very long time, some people have literally grown up with this game being part of their journey.

You're always going to get a number of players who are going to disagree with the development path of the game, marry this with a board that won't ban/mute/police bad words or critique and you'll get a community with some really bitter posts.

I think you overestimate. Yeah lots of people have 2 accounts. But there is a big part of the playerbase on 1 account. The people with 10+ usually don't have them all logged in at the same time.

They used to be called "Expansions" before "DLC" which tends to suggest that - shocker - *you can change that*.

Well...

Not sure, the DD went off before the jam hit but I think it might work the same as jumping out or warping and it might miss.

What did the log say?
---
No. Dude just had 4 million unheated EHP (5.6m heated) against EM damage, plus the shield repper. A single doomsday does up to 1.5 million damage.
---
What do you mean?
---
No this hit, you can see the damage. But I just wonder if you activate, then get jammed in the 10 seconds between damage applying if it will miss.
---
Well. This is exactly what I was looking for. I pvp every night. I’m just not kiting in a slicer and warping off whenever someone gets close :D
---
Thats awesome, adrenaline rush ftw
---
Don't pay them any mind. There are a lot of tsundere Eve players, is all.

Is there any evidence to suggest that the art team has gotten more budget or more staff, and or that qa staff has gotten a smaller budget or decrease staff?
---
"You are attempting to activate a passive module"
---
This is one of those times where "He had a knife" is supremely appropriate.  Look at the front of the Phantasm.
---
Highsec DED/combat anoms/Escalations is an easy 150m/hour. Use a stratios and add in sleeper caches and it goes to 250m/hour.
---
I use VPNs for almost everything I do on the internet, the only exceptions being when I do some banking and it requires a verified IP or they won't do business.
---
That includes me using VPN for playing Eve Online. In this game anonimity is a must due to how it spills to RL and sometimes in very bad ways. 
---
I have never gotten banned or anything for using a VPN, although often times 2FA becomes a requirement, in games as well as other uses.
---
But, I do not bot, RMT and made it a point to disassociate myself from anyone that is known to do so within the game. So my guess is if you are using same VPN or have same IP range as bots / RMTers or have bought something RMT in the past and now are on a VPN or something alike, then you can get banned.
---
Also, if the VPN rotates its IP addresses and the one you have has been used for botting / RMT in the past, then you're screwed. In addition, it may also depend on your location, if the country or state you are from does not want you to use a VPN, then their lawyers may be coming down on CCP and CCP has to do something (show due dilligence) or be in trouble legally, regardless if they have stated in the past to do so for whatever reason. CCPs recommendations and what they say does not under any circumstances go above your local laws.
---
Final question: is there a universal damage cap, or is it dependent upon structure size?
---
Aka if Players could make custom Skins
---

Go on dotlan, pick a region, sort by NPC Kills in last hour.    
---
for example: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The_Forge/Osmon#npc

cause game is dogshit
---
Has the snigg emblem and a flashy title. I was kind of expecting a very epic montage and an official snigg video. All I can say is that it's kind of misleading. 
---
Gotta keep the dream alive
---
It varies for each size, if you check attributes it's there. The minimum dps is 10% of the cap, so an astrahus for example has a 5k damage cap and 20% resists so you need a minimum of about 600 raw dps to keep the timer paused. 
---
Check Dotlan for systems with lots of NPC kills.

It's a very good money for newbee.

You are not going to find elite wrecks (in any quantity) in HS other than where players in T2 ships have died, so gank spots.
---
NPC Large wrecks will be found within a couple of jumps of L4 mission hubs, not often in the actual hub location, most l4 missions are at least 1-2 jumps away..
---
Ferox, mjd capable, 50k ehp so you die anyways but a bit slower.
---
Yes, come back to us friend, the big T-rex is always eating someone
---
Things are in a bit of a lul right now. between holy coalition kicking DRF out of the drone lands last year, Panfam trying to take the provi stations and getting kicked out by test, then trying to invade test and getting their asses handed to them in the north by goons (which lead to some friction in the north finally creating a rift) everyone is in a bit of a re-building/re-organizing phase right now. there are still skirmishes going on all over the place, test is currently on a content deployment to the north beating horde up a bit although even that seems to have taken a bit of a back seat the past couple weeks while we try and secure perimeter some more. I believe goons are on a similar content deployment.  
---
So right now, pretty much anyone you join up with (except maybe the DRF remnant, I think they are still licking their wounds) will be able to get you "some" amount of content, but there isn't anything massive going on right now so most of that content is going to be mostly just for fun. If your looking for something that actually "matters" then in all honestly provi-block is probably your best bet, they are still re-establishing their hold on the area after both panfam and then test rolled through, and they have been having some skirmishes with PHW over sov in provi, but hats about the only place I can think of right at this moment.  
---
If you wanted to come back to test though, we can always use more FC's especially for small gang roaming. I think you will find it is a much different creature than it was back in the wicked creak days, or even before. so it might be worth jumping back in even if its just while you get re-oriented. (and i'm sure it won't be too long before someone else decides to pick a fight with us)
---
Over a bn an hour is plenty doable in 5s if you multibox q bunch of rattles are use a dread. Other than that you won't have the dps to get that kind of isk per hour

nope

Unless you up the distance from which you can loot that's not really helping. And if you do up the loot range for this module, the tractor effects kind of become moot...

Here we go again. As someone who has been in both the old CFC and the new Imperium, the leadership is largely the same, the culture, largely the same, the space communism, even more so. There's no real cultural break since the old days. There's a few differences, we are better organised, less fractured and many FC's have more experience now. Essentially, it's the same entity at its cultural heart. This old 'you're not real goons' according to our enemies, is getting really boring and old. There's been organisational changes but no real cultural ones. The actual rules on being a Goon and the laws that you sign up to, are essentially, unchanged from the CFC days.

&gt; As an almost always logi pilot, I can tell when people hit their adc late or too early.
---
too late? sure, too early? ehhh, unlikely
---
&gt; In many cases the only ships we lose are people who didn't hit their adc or hit it late. It really does make a difference. 
---
and both of these cases can be solved by always hitting the adc "too early", as long as that isn't 15 seconds. Trying to be clutch and use the adc just at the right time will cause *far* more people to do the previous two things than it is worth the gain when doing it "right".
---
That Mino felt like they were dating the Init pilots.
---
where did i "literally" say that? do you know what "literally" means? i don't think this guy is "wrong", i described how his alliance leadership felt about him breaking a rule that every alliance in new eden has. that is not equivalent to thinking botting is good. but let me make it simple:  
---
i think botting is bad, because it spoils this game that we pay for. because it spoils the game for us (and for no other reason i might point out), i think ccp ought to fix it. i even think players should hunt botters if they want to! but i don't think they should have to, whether they're currently miners (players), or mega-coalition leaders (players).
---
it is ccp's job to police its eula, and to catch cheaters who ruin this game for the rest of us. but it sure as fuck isn't mine, or anyone else forking out for a subscription fee.
---
yeah, so it "literally" isn't the title of the thread, please learn the meaning of this word instead of posting replies that consist solely of an incorrect usage of it.
---
So you agree that CCP should investigate the botting activity within the alliances associated with this thread? Then what's the problem.
---
u/ZeldenGM either enforce the meme rule everywhere or just disregard it. It's a silly rule anyway
---
Would make sense in the Ore-Ship-Tree. Mining Frigate -&gt; Salvage Destroyer -&gt; Mining Barge/Exhumer -&gt; Noctis -&gt; Orca -&gt; Rorqual.
---
The Destroyer could have properties like the noctis, except halved bonus on Tractors and a smaller cargobay + no drones. More interesting for salvaging, not so much for looting then. It being faster would enable new ways of practical salvaging in lower sec. Sure there are T1 destis, but there is a ship for almost every gap nowadays.

Please ask a capable adult to read and explain the title of this thread to you.

Thanks.
---
Tip from a PvPer, do not ever stream mining ops, you will be ganked.
---
the problem is that it is a singularly RETARDED idea to suggest that ccp should investigate paying players *for not investigating botting*, when it is ccp's job to investigate botting in the first place. OP should just report the bots to ccp and cut out the middle man.
---
like, are you seriously suggesting that if ccp won't investigate the bots, they're going to investigate the wallets of the alliance they're in? what do you expect them to find? ratting taxes from botters? duh, but it's not a bannable offence to have someone in your alliance who breaks the eula. even if they send you a message saying "ALL MY TAXES ARE FROM BOTTING", you're not under any obligation to kick them or do fucking anything, because it's ccp's job to police their own eula, not you, a paying customer.
---
Good thing nobody is asking CCP to investigate anything just because someone else won't investigate botting. But thanks for the example of a straw man argument, I'll be sure to point to you should anyone be confused about the meaning of the term.
---
I'm a sumple BBC member, I see former WANGS corp, I upvote

so why was the op asking? what are his grounds for suspicion? please explain

So that's how Astero's are made...
---
Thanks for the in depth reply!  I see now how by the time you actually get it to market and sell + the prep time prior to the kill it quickly becomes pennies.
---
It better be great, I've subbed until 2020.
---
could you explain what the connection is between botting activity in an alliance, and the wallets of alliance leadership? will they send money exclusively in increments of 807 or something? what are they going to find there that is going to make "investigate the botting activity of that alliance" LITERALLY mean "wallets of Evictus leadership investigated"?
---
Upon investigation of botting within the alliance, OP reported the bots to CCP and leadership. Leadership became hostile to OP and demanded that he allow the bots to continue earning ISK for the corporation without interference. When OP refused to ignore the bots, OP was kicked from his alliance in retaliation for adversely impacting the botting income of a friendly alliance. No one cares that they're not investigating botting. The issue is that they are knowingly supporting botting because it benefits them.
---

That vertical ship taking the blast and not blowing up ... pity about the title. 
---
[Mmm mmm mmm](https://youtu.be/eTeg1txDv8w)
---
C'mon, kiddo, you're just being obtuse. Part of an investigation into botting on an alliance scale includes attempting to discover where the ISK goes, since that's the ultimate goal of a bot. The bots being supported and run by Evictus don't just kill rats and then biomass with all the ISK they made. That ISK goes somewhere, with a likely end point being RMT. So, yes, investigating the wallets of botters and their money launderers is literally a part of an investigation into botting.
---
i didn't expect anyone to recognize me, maybe from bsb channel? anyway, yea, that stuff is real and it's pretty annoying if ur not brawling or doing fleet combat

Cluster fuck means so much more.
---
If you're looking for small gang action, you could always try joining one of the pvp wormhole alliances that roam into nullsec like Kronos Ritual or Hard Knocks. Income streams in wormhole space is very different compared to income in nullsec sov though, but can still be fairly attractive.
---
I'll plug my own group too. You could try applying into one of the pvp corps in WinterCo like Black Crow Bandits or Cruisers Crew. WinterCo regularly gets subcap fights at home. We don't send out endless pings and it's a pretty chill environment (only slightly more hostile than the average office).

it's official, i'm re-applying to Dreddit. God help me

---
yeah but none of that is suspicious activity! if you shoot blues in any alliance, you're gonna get kicked. it's a standard alliance rule.
---
&gt;No one cares that they're not investigating botting. The issue is that they are knowingly supporting botting because it benefits them. 
---
yeah but that's not wrong, or against the eula, and ccp cannot take any action on that basis, because they cannot obligate paying customers to police botting. it literally doesn't matter if their entire space empire is dependent on bots, it's still not their job or duty to kick or remove bots, so ccp has nothing to investigate. unless of course they themselves do the botting, but the best way to investigate that is to look at the bots which op reported,
---
the only grounds for suspicion you have laid out are that they didn't take action to remove bots. but they don't have to, and even if they benefit, that's also fine and ccp can't punish them for it or there would be fucking outroar.
---
Let me know if you need any help at all I'm not in dreddit but another test corp but always happy to assist.

Beautiful fight. Back and forth and chaos at times :D We need more of this in eve.
---
yeah, so you investigate the wallets of the bots, you don't start with the alliance leadership wallet, that's retarded. if it leads you somewhere, you look there and ban relevant parties. it's not the fucking criminal justice system, ccp have all the logs and can see where it all goes whenever they want. there is zero reason to start your investigation in alliance wallets cos some guy got kicked for shooting blues.

CCP tells ‘there must be something more’ in reply,
---
but I have same experience, I once got ban for using VPN and unbanned after about 10 days...(they told me about account security blah blah but I’m p sure that I just got blacklisted IP)
---
And I know some of my friends got banned for nothing, and unbanned after few days or max 2 weeks.
---
There must be something wrong in CCP’s automatic ban policy, and It’s true CCP is too late in this kind of situation, which must solved very fast.
---
But one good thing is If you get this kind of wrong ban about IP for first time, You’ll never get wrong ban next time. I think CCP puts victim on something like ‘white list’ after first mistake.

idk which argument ur talking about or where u pulled these assumptions from, i never said anything of the sort. i said their (CCPs) priorities are off, which they are considering how much money they continuously dump into one failed new idea after another while neglecting their one real source of income. as for the skins, yes, from a consumer's perspective it's really fucking annoying to have to deal with broken shit all the time and watch the developer keep making it look better instead of fixing it, that's the truth. i get making skins is easier and more profitable than fixing stuff, but does that mean it's ok for us to settle for this? is this really an argument a company can bring to its customers? really? idk where u worked for 20 years but lmao. idk if more developers would help or not, i know it's 2019 and i play a number of other games which have none of these issues. i also know they could commit to solving them if they really wanted to and they could get it done. not next month, maybe not even this year, but just like it's not easy, it's not impossible either and they could have some permanent, if slow, progress instead of duct taping crap up every month
---
Brave, PL misses you
---
Yea I was just idk 
---
Why just May tho
---
What do you define as being farmed?
---
What happened with pl?
---
hh to that
---
What's 5? Holocaust? 
---
[DSONS] next ?
---
Yep, PvP in Eve is a great source of adrenaline rushes because of the potential consequences. You often get shaky hands in your first solo fights. It's a very unique experience for a video game.
---
then you dont have to engage with it, no one is forcing you to post.
---
Snuffed out was adversity's final solution to the fedup question
---
thats an interesting standpoint, what do you mean its strategically run by test?
---
So do you see brave as an entity just for some quick and nothing beyond that?
---
small russian Corp that killed more Supers in 2018 than your shitty PL in last 2-3years alone :)
---
This DD blap by rag was one of badass frag I've seen. So it's not possible anymore in today's meta or?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4iwDaJnXLk&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
nice bait post but whatever 
---
anyone with 2 eyes and a brain can tell that brave does nothing of its own initiative, 90% of it is from test, w/o test brave just chills and krabs
---
more like everyone just gave up complaining because CCP clearly didn't give a fuck that chat was still broken which is why they kept saying it was fixed even though it continues to randomly shit the bed to this day.
---
Another sov change, of course, is Triumvirate shitting the bed.
---
except for the part where manning the citadel guns is still broken and results in most people getting a desynced view outside station and sometimes randomly disconnects the person trying to use the guns.
---
throw in having a reputation of treating everyone not from the volcano like shit and having no hope of advancement if you aren't from round there.
---
You are right. TEST and Brave should just WIDOT into Goons already. not sure why they bother to claim independence at this point.
---
This. Looking at dotlan, 430 kills in impass over the last 7 days, half of which are from npcs, compared to 6353 in catch. They are doing just fine.
---
In TISHU version... whatever version it was when we held cloud ring, it was right after the super changes, where you could tackle supes with normal points and not everyone was used to that yet (giving dope kills like [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/55235764/) ).
---
I guess that included us, because when we made a few jumps and took a dozen or so gates unsupported in a small gang of supers through lowsec to frag [samthedog](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54266855/) we kinda forgot that the tower would point our supes, which it did... for a *really* long time as we slowly ground them into structure in a RACE AGAINST TIME since no one had any tank nor reps on field.
---
Great times and the height of TISHU hubris (for that round). Really no idea how we got away with this kind of shit.
---
well that fits with the go-to response of if we can't fix it we just ignore it and wait for the player base to give up all hope we will ever do anything then move on to the next thing we will fuck up.
---
Brave exists because there is still appetite for a less bloc-branded newer-player and casual-player alliance.  
---
Someone with this branding is always going to get "farmed" because they prioritize taking all fights whatever the odds of success in order to provide content and experience to its players. 
---
I see them as our rowdy little brother's, and I love them.
---
no randomly when I log in in 0.0 I see people in local who aren't actually there and when I move from one system to the next they stay in my local window even though they may be dozens of systems away or even in some cases logged off. Jita just gets mentioned a lot because it busy and easily noticed by many users.
---
1o1l88
---
but why is it only catch?
---
Brave has the potential to deploy pretty much anywhere.
---
I have 9999 hours and 100t in the bank. (plus I have a large penis)
---
but there are other ways to get fights other than just feeding to 60 man goon moa fleets in 20 talwars, why dont brave do anything else?
---
It's n-not like I want a functioning Jita local or anything, you stupid b-baka!
---
Being hellcamped into a single system with the inability to field more than 1 cap without a PL super or titan killing it.
---
We literally had a titan camp the undock of our station for days if not weeks. Nothing we could do about it. Any krabbing was put to an end within one hour, no place for ratting carriers or rorquals. 
---
Honestly, Brave is no longer farmed. An enemy cap or super in Catch or Impass will be dropped on within minutes. Any fleet or ship that comes to impass gets dropped on, actually. In Catch we have rules preventing us from always dropping caps so that we have content, otherwise you’d find a HAW dread or nine in most engagements.
---
Eve is dead, let's go play Star Citizen. Oh wait.
---
The Imperium exists only to whelp fleets into the GE-8 fort PDS.  Change my mind.
---
our structures are here, impass is where we make big money, our allies are here.  when you undock on the weekend why burn 20 jumps or a jump clone and do all kinds of logistics to have 5 ships to welp when you can undock and fight whenever? 
---
fleet up on elo fifth reich
---
Mittens, save us from the Russian menace! Mobilize the krabs!
---
Disappointing was a bit harsh. Unfinished is definitly the word.
---
CHANGED! Leaves the room...
---
Can confirm, mostly just PvPs or PvEs.
---
Send it to Momofuku Endashi in game for absolutely nothing in return.
---
Misleading was a bit harsh. Unfinished is definitly the word.
---
It'd be so cool to have a graffiti skin for freighters and industrials.
---
Oh boy. Thats a game changer.
---
I don't know where we go from here?
---
One of my favorite CK2 posts is "Can I, as a man, seduce the pope if we're both gay?"
---
I dont remember the km for that dread but iirc that dread was untanked vs this almost purely brick tanked mino
---
1488 reactive gas added to all doctrine ships on contract
---
Do people not understand that Imperium is just a less obscene rebranding of CFC?
---
They are living in lowsec now
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/73622266/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73622266/)
---
I hate krabbing with a fiery passion, its the equivalent of coming home from work and continuing to work a job at the equivalent of a 2$ an hour wage.
---
This wasn't test my dude, we are equal opportunities killers, if test bothered to form enough people and fight its just more targets for us
---
I'll check this out, WH life sounds good.
---
I play in Brave for easy money exploration in catch and ratting in impass, and learning some basic stuff in their fleets.
---
How's the isk/hr? Better than carrier ratting? Sprained my wrist after a 4 hour session last week (also the event that made me reconsider nullsec life).
---
I like my fellow Goons but I'm not cut out for this krabbing lifestyle. Too difficult.
---
What is a burner mission?
---
There's also Wormhole space. No local so you never know who's in system with you and connections that change frequently. Due to restrictions on how much mass can be put through wormholes (there's different categories with different attributes) fights are usually limited to smaller sized. It's so much fun. :)
---
Guess that's always an option, but I already pay my subs and would feel guilty spending so much RL cash on a game.
---
I enjoyed the Imperium but I can't force myself to krab any longer. Also lost 3b in margin trading in September, so little hesitant to go back.
---
1b an hour? That doesn't sound right.
---
No chance I'll be mining in highsec. But if I join a group in J-Space, perhaps I'll setup PI and run C3s.
---
Not a troll reply btw
---
He mate, hope all is well. The above is accurate. First we had everyone in eve red, fun pure pvp time, when roaming was more a topic. I think its the starving wolf you described, thats whne botia and me both switched from fink too volt. We went for a break to provi and kinda sticked. Fun time, tons of fleets qnd provi history ane historic battles. We grew, went to catch, overreached and got steamrolled. Volt was in the past often assocated as goon frends, and they helped us defend catch. So we joined the imperium where the current players enjoy alot of freedom to mine, build and pvp.
---
 For me personally as my kids growing up they stay up aftehr 20.00 and require home work Help daily. 4 daughters. I fear when the datun starts i ll pick up pvp again haha in rl. So i made the choice to drop eve as a hobby. This happened mear the end of our catch time, as 2 entered middle school and past the age of 12. Funny thing is when i starte to play eve i had zero kids. As i told all players in fleets and allq]iance; real life always first!
---
I stay in touch with frends. Eve is virtual but the community is real. Last week we had to say goodbuy to ashade grey s son who died in a car accident, he also flew logi in volt. With alot of people we raised over 6000 pound for his funeral. I donated plex on top of that for a viking funeral. We ll come togtehr online with alot for that end ofjqn.
---
Eversterdam ill visit a bit, as one toon stays active in eve, just not so Active. Eve was a blast thanks too you and other players who joined fleets, and a lot of them hehe. And my kids atm give me the same feeling of making the right decisions, as i did in eve, with focus on people ratehr then other motivationd.
---
Fly safe and maybe cheers sometime!
---
Dude, you're looking at this totally wrong.
---
Most alliances:
---
Goons have 60 dudes, and we only have 20.  Stand down, stay docked.
---
Brave:
---
Goons have 60 dudes, and we only have 20.  Who wants to YOLO some Talwars?
---
More for me
---
The dc at the end was great.
---
I thought Abyssal sites were garbage ISK? My corpmates told me you'd be lucky to make as much as a VNI in a T4 cruiser site.
---
https://i.imgur.com/AN6MDBK.jpg
---
It will never happen because you have a bunch of panzy ass players that rely on the safety net it provides, yet you'll continually hear them talk about what elite PvPers they are and how everyone else is risk averse 
---
I wonder if they'll mind if I leave my alts in but move my main. Maybe I can declare another main?
---
+5 THIS RECOMMENDATION, IT'S FUN TO FIGHT NERDS THAT DRINK AS MUCH AS I DO AND [DON'T GIVE A FUCK](https://media3.giphy.com/media/l378puWI9Fpi4OApO/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c2edb114671304749b62393)
---
Provi was never about the biggest or best fleet. Its what makes people move on, but also imspires others to stay for years. Its an idea of creating access too null whilst respecting others. Nrds isnt ment to be easy. Every fc and ceo who spend time in provi knows how hard nrds is, and yet they know what the power of that idea is. Guys like jin, fard and others fielded and punched even above the provi weight for years, and i liek to think i had alot of fun adding over 10k kills to my board in my provi days and making frends who still stand out in real life now and fillign fleets past 250. Only last week one of our pilots ashade grey lost his son, who also plays eve. Both in goons now. We raised money for his funeral, and alot of provi pilots i saw in the gofundme. So for me provi was a time well spend both ingame and in reallife Hours, those things arent measured in number of caps.
---
you sound like you need a hug
---
You sound like you don't understand how this works, every fleet you guys send is roughly double what we can muster. So we can outship you to even the odds or drop caps. Lately you don't bring small fleets you bring feroxes and battleships .. I saw a 100man Megathron fleet roll thorough. Pandemic horde and goons have large numbers .. we don't. We get a goon fleet come probably every hour or so, expecting us to form ( new goons btw) not the same people, often the same fc redline. We don't exist to form for you so you can bash a structure or whatever, even go to Impass and get helicopter dicked. The average goon who thinks we are being farmed has been a shitty no PvP line member for 2 months and now he's done a couple fleets,thinks he's amazing because of herd immunity and proceeds to shit talk. No one is impressed.
---
How rude of my, forgot to post BR.  
---
FC said he wanted to try and bait out some carriers. 2 jumps later we saw a shady fly catcher. We waited to see what happened and sure as shit, cyno comes in, nid drops. Some other nerds start joining in random shit. We popped the phobos real quick, then all hands on the nid. popped him. at some point a mauler zoomed on in to 0 and popped cyno, another nid comes in. Popped the mauler. was working on the nid. then they warped in an apostle, and it was basically was over for us at that point. Logi was doing great, but more DPS started to come in and the fighters started to feed on nagas. We had a great time and thanks for the fight!
---
Jezus tap dancing Bob.... 
---
This structure bash took over one year to plan and execute and we're really proud of the huge amount of effort we put into it!
---
lmao so true
---
Definitely not true. Enemy fcs know what an adc is and roughly how long it lasts. They will plink a few volleys at it then hard switch. You can tell who lites early and who doesn't. 
---
Im sorry you feel that way about goons (not rly tbh, just being nice)
---
What does brave exist for if you dont mind me asking?
---
:(
---
The living miss the dead, not the other way around mate
---
"We had a little bit of a complication, but we got it done"
---
I lost it right there. 
---
username checks out.
---
Op forgets we win most of the engagements in GE
---
? Why does goons exist?
---
I see, do people find dying for 0 gain fun. Undock-&gt;fleet warp -&gt; die
---
I dont a lot of new people enjoying that.
---
&gt;I dont a lot of new people enjoying that.

Then you're not looking.
---
CCPlease. Never do this.
---
Hi there, his dad actually posted a post and alot of people donated too the gofundme page. I think most are actually eve Players. The post from his fatehr has over 400 replies from players in general and guys like me we flew with him. He will not be forgotten
---
lol deploying the delve wasnt a good idea was it elo????????? bosonged so much he want afk
---
1. Take a region as ratting space for your alliance  
---
2. Get roamed and harrassed by neighbours from neighbour regions  
---
3. Find some alliance that doesn't have space but it capable of holding some if you help them on timers  
---
4. Blue that alliance, help it evict your neighbours and help them defend their new space when needed  
---
5. repeat 3-4 until all your neighbours are blue  
---
6. enjoy safe ratting space because your blues absorb most roams
---
Wut?
---
As a close friend to a CEO in BL, I can confirm it's all falling apart. I can also confirm that it will be back together in a few days and will be Black Legion....
---
lol, bye BL, was nice knowing you while it lasted
---
Or White Legion...
---
a dot for every failure
---
Im not sure for the initital reson why gonnswarm was created, I havent been playing that long.
---
As for now, goons exist for winning eve. which is what we do everyday.
---
Il ask again, why does brave exist?
---
cringeworthy
---
Op success boys
---
thats news to me, thanks
---
il have to put an alt in there and try it out for myself, eve has been getting kinda stale lately.
---
most alliances have infrastructure set up at home, thats not the point.
---
Would you as a brave member be against deploying to geminate to fight horde is what im essentially trying to get at.
---
Well, I never wanted EVE to have daily login challenges, but look at us now. I appreciate the indirectsupport of my idea.
---
yes
---
spod bless
---
I don't get it, cause me no follow.
---
But I lol'd anyway
---
Someone forgot to load their high sec killright overview. 
---
It's so fucking easy to spot this shit before you head into the engagement.
---
For winning eve? By recruiting all your enemies and blueing the rest ? If you havnt played long and you joined goons straight up you are playing the game on easy mode. Try something with a challenge, i.e. Be Brave. 
---
Hey at least this legion has the dignity to die through its lowpoints and reform when they are going to do things again
---
It was a lot of fun while it lasted.
---
One day
---
They will hear Theras Call, and rejoin bob
---
In Fozziesov you can't really hold much more space than the space you live in. So after you evict a hostile entity from a region, you either have to move in and live there yourself or install an allied alliance that is willing to live there.
---
TEST has a habit of installing alliances as a buffer zone. Their home region is surrounded by a buffer zone of blues on most sides. BRAVE and the rest of Legacy have been there for a while, RAZOR and XIX have been added recently to hold Tenerifis.
---
Does that make BRAVE "pets"? I don't know. But TEST is clearly the powerhouse in that coalition and the south is divided in a very deliberate way. It's a mutually beneficial relationship, of course. Maybe even respectful. But so is the relationship between a dog and its owner.
---
Graffiteve Skin when
---
lol stupid black legion more like loser legion hahahaha bet they dont even have rorquals LOL
---
You don't even know what the deployment actually is and most of you fucking scattered when we undocked anyway.
---
Haven't you got some spod to mine?
---
origin director leak: https://i.imgur.com/jGY3x4U.png
---
hurts to see but i had a good time while it lasted
---
as a ceo in black legion i can confirm, we havent heard from elo in almost a month and no other FCs are willing to step up and run fleets. had a good time but its time to go afk and wait 6-10 months before i can play the game again
---
Well this got out a little bit earlier than expected...
---
INSU's leaving because Dexster/Musky were leaking alliance leadership messages, and it looks like they're either going to NCDOT or somewhere else. DRONV is leaving with CHKM8 as well at the end of the week, likely going to go to TEST or somewhere in Legacy. BRED, NEG, and Sturmgrenadier are staying on board for the time being, but it's looking like BL will shut down by the end of the month... There is a rumor going around that Origin is going to end up in PL, not sure how true this is or not right now since Elo is still afk and has been for almost three weeks now.
---
o7 Black Legion... eyes forward the cyno is lit ; _ ;
---
Some of our corps are/were. Wow Oijanen, let's camp some gates. Heaps of fun.
---
Ooof.
---
Since your attacking me il bite back.
---
How can you claim being in brave is a challenge? Having your hand held by and having the test batphone ready at all times isnt challenging. Saying being in brave is a challenge is doing a disservice to all the small groups who live under the jump ranges of all the big and manage to survive day to day.
---
I used to be in one of said groups until I had my life change to the point where I cant show the same dedication as I once did.
---
Bye "friend" see you in your nightmares
---
Our deployments actually accomplish things.
---
This version of munnins online was not what i expected.
---
It was fun while it lasted. Fly safe ayyle o7
---
Join Horde. \\0/
---
Oh no a Tatara killmail from almost 2 months ago! What ever will we do...
---
Should we start listing all the PanFam and ICY structures you've lost in Eve since then?  
---
Well, to be fair, you don't have to be in the goons to make money. Much of what is advertised these days is belt mining which in my opinion is "new money". Just now is it considered worth while if you're in a rorqual. For everyone else in Eve, many groups have gotten this far without belt mining. Trading, incursions, wormhole pve, contracts, citadel market hubs, renting/rental, speculation, self funded. I can elaborate on a few but there are hundreds of ways to make money other than rorqual mining.
---
So your position is that you just want to undock always in the same place for the same fight. Is this the opinion of most brave members?
---
Meh... they won't be missed.
---
I thought tishu died after they left PL
---
lol apparently u dont know what a deployment is, just sitting in sakht station? typical "elite" pvpers
---
lol these fuckin bl nerds dont even know man we;re rockin it hardcore cool down here and delve and they thought they could COME DOWN HERE AND MESS WITH US??? props to you man and all my goon brothers. goon for life
---
can anyone donate me some isk?
---
the only thing you deploy are excavators lmao
---
The main problem was that half our logi wing decided to go suspect rather than let one scimitar die. That killed way more people than the killrights themselves 
---
You seem salty dude.  Show us where on the doll the fun touched you.
---
we just couldnt stand against goon strength, had fun while i was down there though
---
Classic!
---
Always set green. It's not 'optional' in high sec. One Muppet can bring down the whole fleet.
---
Happy hannukah brother
---
&gt;Would you as a brave member be against deploying to geminate to fight horde is what im essentially trying to get at.
---
Because they are doing their own thing in Catch.  Just because Test is up North doesn't mean Brace has to be.
---
Hmm, is my Revenant safe?
---
From looking at the latest MER and the activity in venal it is quite clear that BL has been dead for quite a while, not much mining or ratting going on. i do not understand all the hype surrounding Elo Knight, when the numbers clearly show that he has no idea on how to run an eve online alliance.
---
what makes you think im salty?
---
Looking for a new corp as Insu is going to join Test :(
---
Fortress Delve shatters the Legion at the gates :(
---
That’s what everyone said on comms like 500 times. Some of the scimis said that they were green and there was a bug, but I think they’re just so used to null that they forgot how safeties work, since my safety always stopped me from repping suspects
---
it dosent have to be because test is doing it, should i rephrase it to deploying to drone lands to mess around?
---
Happy Hanukah?
---
We are doing market shenanigans with mining gear.
---
So you are new, not dedicated to the game, think you are winning vicariously through others? Do you understand jump ranges? We are not within range of the test batphone. There is this place called Esoteria, Dinos live there. Impass is not in range. UQ is in range but we don't batphone for fights unless we need to, in fact a batphone takes time and the average Brave fleet won't have the ability to batphone Test.. hurrduur msg Mr Progod can you send some Caps there are 100 dudes here we can't kill atm our fcs are not online. I can count on one hand how many times we call test to help standing fleet. It's not a high priority to clean your roaming gang out. I think I'm winning eve, you think you are winning eve. No one's winning eve lol it's a life wasting simulator.
---
Note that the goon Tempest dropped her sec stat from 4.07 all the way down to -7.3 after her SB cycle.
---
Because they are doing their own thing in Catch.
---
Boom!
---
go ahead and link a structure that was worth more than your 73b tatara in your high sec campaign
---
Insurrection is trash anyways, it's a failed corp off a shit CEO. The CEO is a massive carebear who poses as a PVPer. He is the reason MC died and can be held responsible for GC, Atlas and AAA all no longer exist as well. 
---
I just died a little inside.
---
If you only played for like a day, I would get a new referral account, it'll give you 250k free sp to spend on whatever.
---
First thing I would do is the agency missions, then the Soe epic quest and once you finish both of those find which parts of the game you liked and start from there 
---
I only FC'd a couple of High sec fleets and to be honest, it's a lot of stress. You can end up whelping through no fault of your own. That said, there are steps you can take to reduce the risk massively.
---
you know you wanna be a dino, just stick with them will be fun
---
i spent like 13 hours coming up with this new reddit account and now it’s fucking useless FUCK why did we deploy to delve it’s literally ruined the alliance 
---
Hopefully someone is going to copy paste the noob advice, its a good list. But eve is a sandbox. You can do whatever you want, even though that can be overwhelming. Do you want to mine? If not, get a ship that can shoot things. Best advice i can give is get a mentor or a corp that mentors. A big part of eve is the social interactions and making friends/enemys. Best of luck.
---
We have sigs that do these things.  Right now we are focused on clearing our home of Simole Farmers and getting Rich.  
---
I was FC for the fweddit fleet. Most of the suspect scimis weren't tackled until we specifically started shooting them...
---
MC, BL, what alliance is going to be abandoned next?
---
Until Next Time

Abyssal runner here.  I run tier 4 dark sites in Hawks with 2 homies. I take in about 120 to 300 mil an hour, hand that's just my third of the pay. Plenty of people triple box them. In my opinion, cruisers are significantly more difficult to use compared to frigates. A decent fit is about 600 mil for tiers 3 and 4. I've heard of a few soloists running tier 5s in 2 bil gilas. It takes a lot longer to make a profit in these- their lifespan is based on luck, and they make expensive losses, compared to frigates that get paid off in 1 site. It's certainly possible to use cruisers, but frigate abyssals are very easy and cheap to get into. Would recommend them.
---
The only difference between goons and brave is that goons have 3 times more people, change my mind. 
---
Only took 8 months of planning, a record for the initiative. 
---
youre corps fucking trash anyway recruiting a dude who tried to scam CCP and losing 2 titans in 2 months what fucking losers
---
I undock in three places, Catch to fight you, Impass to Krab, Impass to Helicopter dick a leshak gang. I've got a JC in Oijanen but why go north when the fights at home ?
---
\#dinopower i guess
---
There are a lot of shit tier groups that the Imperium can piss on for being total trash heaps. IMHO Brave isn't one of them. Brave has heart, self respect, and they crave content. All admirable qualities. I don't know what more you could want from them. Can you imagine if they were our size and strength and fought like they do now? If dreams came true that would be a bloddy great war. 
---
&gt; He is the reason MC died
---
Dont let us hanging like that .. spill the beans.
---
That fact that you're salty AF.
---
Oh, and your salty ass post history.
---
In fact, I'm 100% convinced that you are not only salty, but have some sort or severe learning disability or mental issue or some shit. 
---
Sad to see Elo kill another alliance. Eve needs more groups not less
---
I'm just kinda pissed that we raised funds to send Elo to Vegas and he's binning it all off again.
---
You seem fun. 
---
for the past few years they have shat on brave and evicted them constantly for the sole reason because they exist
---
this stopped around the time legacy moved to the south, and PL realized brave can fight back now
---
ive been back for like 49 minuets...
---
https://twitter.com/BP_EloKnight/status/1081053321467781120 see you guys in bl v5
---
It's not like this wasn't predictable.
---
A single structure? There are none.
---
The total number of structures we've killed from ICY alone is well over double that. Add in the Horde plus all your alt corps and yeah it's significantly more than that. 
---
Add in the structures in Geminate and Vale and lol.
---
How can you kill an alliance when he was literally the only reason it even existed.
---
Only if it's a lowsec gate to Stain
---
Elo is BL
---
Make it a one item only thing like the palatine KS and watch some random goon deploy it for the lulz. 
---
why is act cool sixth step if there is no fifth
---
waaaa someone tanked their capital!
---
You think people stick around for long when their corp plays musical alliances? Eventually it becomes more of a headache than it's worth. It is definitely relevant when an alliance folds, regardless of whether it was a cult of personality. 
---
You're forgetting about the wormholes btw.
---
Always suspected you was down for some BBC action.

---
Hi Jason. 
---
Anyone recruiting? I might even consider goons.
---
How's the corp or alliance you're running doing?  
---
You basically have two options, Join the  Blue donate (Test, Init, Goons etc) or Join Horde and fight everyone. Content always comes to Horde and many a glorious fights are to be had. 
---
 There is no third option. 
---
If you don't care about rorqual mining or carrier ratting and primarily doing pvp BL is the most fun I have had in eve. Typically have a USTZ fleet, try to avoid fozzie sov, go around the map fighting people whats not to like? Its actually a fairly casual alliance as well both in player attitude and sp/alt requirements. 
---
RUN AWAY!
---
Anyone recruiting?
---
I can't believe this is happening... I really thought this time would be different
---
Random Encounter in a Minmatar Station?
---
https://twitter.com/BP_EloKnight/status/1081053321467781120
---
Honestly the BL and PL nomadic lifestyle isn’t really viable anymore it seems. I was in it for a little and it was fun, however the game has changed so much to make that sort of play style irrelevant.
---
Come to think of it, I never actually saw elo or heard his voice. It was always Svet or Tiana or Xirxo relaying messages from on high. We always thought Elo was neck-deep in frogtech over in our froglabs but maybe...maybe he never really existed at all.
---
RIP BL. 30 bros looking for a new home, dm me.
---
You know he's right, Grath.  Elo's an FC, not an alliance leader.
---
Imagine living in space where theres all kinds of pvp-content literally nonstop. On top of that, the dudes you live with have no problems whatsoever welping silly shit into 100 man fleets because who the fuck cares about kb's anyway. Sounds good to me. Welcome to Catch, Brave is recruiting.
---
Yeah, single cycle things like fighter salvos or mjds keep cycling for another quarter cycle before resetting 
---
Ouch
---
wow its space and a bee not at all styled like fatbee must be an eve player!!!!!
---
If I had to guess, I’d guess /u/SacredGeometry7
---
Nope
---
lmao way to kill BL
---
Why deploy when people are going to their space to fight?
---
You are looking more and more dumb every time you post.
---
Hey now dude they did this with ONLY a test batphone. They didn't even have goons on standby. So brave! 
---
I'm pretty certain we won't be missed.
---
They actualy only have ganking in common. And even then its all in wormhole so there realy is no reason to even mention that. I looked at his killboard and i could not even see any deaths to wingspan or code so idk what he is sperging about.
---
INSU did very well in their trial period with us, but once they showed up they started demanding more power to them and their voice to be heard, even though their fleet participation sloped off rather dramatically late in the Branch campaign. Most of them didn't even deploy to Delve and [would just feed caps](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73393804/) to the Venal Russians [all day long](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74344338/) Most of them didn't even bother deploying to Delve, but Dexster/Musky kept harassing Elo in public alliance channels and saying that INSU was being treated unfairly.
---
So if I had to imagine it would have to be something pretty similar to why they got booted from MC considering that Dexster and INSU as a whole are poison.
---
Not to mention every time they try to defend their sov they lose massively. https://zkillboard.com/kill/74344338/
---
Easy free cap kills.
---
Heather Heyer
---
Who are you?
---
NancyDot and PL (though the jury is still out on if they qualify as already failscaded)
---
Your not wrong. There is definitely better work that can be done
---
RIP Elo the Golden Knight, you will be missed but never forgotten. 
---
This is really all /u/Mikal_Vector s fault tbh if DNG didn't leave and inspire others to leave none of this would be happening. 
---
HOW DID YOU GET THIS WTF
---
RIP
---
Used to this by now
---
Should have expected it
---
Elo will never come back for good
---
I’ll give you a karma point for that accurate assertion 
---
who dis?
---
Chossuh bro
---
Leads participation metrics? You must be looking at a different post than the rest of us lol.
---
Ding, ding, ding...we have a winner!
---
Perhaps the next time Elo comes back you guys should just use him as an FC with a dedicated unit of pilots. That way your entire alliance won’t collapse every time Elo goes outside for more then a day. God knows PL could use an FC (and a few wins for that matter)
---
Not the first EVE reference. I need to check this game out.
---
This time is totally different guys.
---
Lets jerk each other off until we all just explode
---
Because leaks. 
---
Just like most fleets he goes on.
---
I’m not a fan of Elo Knight or BL in general but the loss of content creators and alliances closing only hurts the game so am sad to see this.  
---
pepehands
---
i mean at least only wasted an hour of my life in provi area this time as opposed to a year?
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Everyone knows you'll be running your alpha account on a laptop on the side 
---
and who was #1 past 2 months?
---
and Crabs won so happy right :)
---
they are retarded then or just trash, or only did a few and got unlucky. the loot is good, but the risk is high.
---
right now my average site is about 10mins with abotu 50m soloing t3 electricals in a 300m retri. 
---
ive had as high as 1.6bn/hr and as low as -300m 
---
t4 in a gila is pretty safe and comfy while still being better than deds and a fuckton better than vni ratting. ive never heard anyone say its so low so i bet he died and is salty and just saying its worthless.
---
it also depends on the filament your doing. darks and exotics pay most. darks a almost impossible to run in most ship types. exotics dont really give u a good bonus but they dont hrut you like darks so its good for semi bling fits to reliably run isk positively once you know the spawns.
---
Have fun in your next alliance Zah
---
Sometimes, just as in real life, you have to do things you do not want to do if it is for the safety and welfare of those that look to you for leadership and protection.
---
Even if you do not believe you were in the wrong, you pay the fine. Live to fight another day. 
---
In the meantime, I'm on the lookout for good firesale deals.
---
lmao pls const you barely logged in to know where you were at any given moment in EVE
---
That's kinda the whole point of jerking.
---
KarmaFleet has had the highest participation for well over a year, probably more but I have not looked back that far.
---
HA HA HA HA HA fucking retards, I knew this was going to happen.
---
For a slightly differing view... EVE has very long tails.  So, on one end, there are people who run a jaw-dropping number of accounts.  On the other end, there are a lot of people who only have a single account.  This averages out to a middle ground where the mean number of accounts per player, across the entire player base is about 1.5.  The primary reasons that the average player gets alts are for division of priorities or so that they don't have to find someone to help them out for mundane tasks.
---
Somewhat aside from the considerations of why one might want more accounts, not everyone likes running multiple characters simultaneously.  I personally hate doing so, for example, because I have enough on my plate flying one ship.  I know other people who will cheerfully bring three ships in combat at once, especially if they can have someone else lead the ships around by the nose for positioning.
---
In any event, I'll note that almost everyone who runs a lot of accounts has some sort of moneymaking scheme that can provide plex for most of them, because it gets prohibitively expensive.
---
(Personally, I have 3 accounts, but I really don't need that many at this point; it's sunk cost and occasional convenience.  Every single one of them is &gt;5 years old... this is basically main pvp character and two backups, at this point.  The three of them are all used in my industrial endeavors, along with some of the other character slots, which aren't training, because I have them.)
---
Don't judge us
---
RGSU are super crabs as well, don't try to pass yourselves off as some force to be reckoned with. 
---
When I said nothing of value was lost, it was not for the meme, it is because GSF will not even notice your absence.
---
Yeah I guess the 150+ guys who showed up for his fleet all the time don't matter for shit, huh...?
---
Just because you're upset he's leaving doesn't mean you should take it out on us.
---
What? 
---
you guys always shit on blocks for being f1 pushers. you are literally the same.
---
hahahahahaha
---
rip fifth reich 
---
So that's what we were doing in sakht? Observing rorqs so we could learn how to mine!
---
RIP....
---
Still nakes no sense.  What happened? 
---
With the strength of the mibibg boosts and the fact that the Orca can mine a lot itself with it's drones, it's pretty much always better mining yield than another bqrge. Add the ease of hauling into the equation and it's an even more attractive option. 
---
Dude a lot of us poured our hearts into this project and now he's just shuttering it down?
---
I'm not sure if I'm gonna even keep my sub going after this
---
ofc they have the highest raw numbers, they are a freaking megacorp. Its relative everyone else looks at, read what is written above the relative stats by atrum himself.
---
Want to buy my muninns?
---
christ that meme never gets old.
---
you have probably lost way over "73b" in azbels alone, lets not add up the sotiyos to that
---
Being a UALX survivor i resent this comment.
---
BL's best corp AVDOT is looking for a new home. As expected , both literacy and sport are blooming.
---
Not true one of elos lessons was to bind muninn button to f2
---
I'm still deciding based on my offers if I'm gonna be subbed in a month or two.
---
I'm just going to sell everything and buy rorqs
---
imagine fucking your mates over right after christmas and new year and bouncing without even a warning. before i joined origin everyone told me that this would happen and they were right.
---
btw if you decide to come back again and pull this shit, at least strip your directors alts roles. thanks for nearly a tril in ships, mods and ur wallet retard
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZFiAdtc.png
---
Gee, who coulda seen that coming?
---
Who hurt you
---
At least you admit that you support botting so long as it benefits you.
---
Any vacancies?
---
We know where the ISK goes. Into the wallet of the alliance that supports and promotes botting.
---
Like what?
---
WHO ARE YOU?
---
sorry dude, I had to do it To em. Maybe next time it'll be real :s
---
Nonofire is the only heir to the BL
---
That took you 13 hours mate?
---
oh, no, cant just blap things off field instantly, what a shame
---
Well we do have some poles that we want to get rid of
---
&gt; I see, do people find dying for 0 gain fun. Undock-&gt;fleet warp -&gt; die
---
What fun is there in cowering in dock because they have more numbers and shiner ships?
---
Logi FC for that fleet here. Folks were reprimanded. Jedi business, go back to your drinks.
---
That's what happens when you let Nestors breed....
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctmDzdbE2Qg
---
Anything is better than being in snuffed though.
---
The only people looking at relative are those that are trying to stay off of the shit list. What, exactly, does RGSU bring to the table? You have 49 characters. Of course your relative participation is high. 1 person bringing 3 alts on a fleet can skew your numbers much more than someone in a larger corp. It does not make you a better or more elite corp. 
---
All I really want is a Hel. I don't have access to a 3d printer. Perhaps we could work something out. PM me
---
Yeah that was fun/confusing to watch :)
---
Seleene killed MC before INSU joined. The ideals that led to bringing on and working for the likes of Suas are more responsible for MC’s eventual death than INSU is. 
---
/#AlekWasRight
---
The advice from ConcordGrape and davey is pretty sound, while yes you can play eve solo. Its a lot better when you have a good Corp to fly with.
---
Pm me if you are looking for a Corp/mentor and I can help you out or direct you to the right people.
---
HI CHOSSUH!!!!!!
---
We had sov? 
---
This is the dumbest post. Even I get why BRAVE has fun, they could be Horde ya know?
---
It's funny cause racists
---
Downtime is a wonderful thing
---
And yet so many other low number corps still suck and have low relative?  
---
By your logic you could argue every corp sucks in goons. RGSU killed more supers than most alliances last year, set up a bunch of SV rorq dunks, has highest relative participation, yet rando spodbrain #45 678 doesn't see what exactly they brought to the table. 
---
That's pretty funny. What a world.
---
rofl

post more screenshots of the loot

If I were active in the slightest I’d poach your goofy ass in a second.

As someone who spent all of three weeks in BL this past summer I am going to firmly blame everything on the likes of Big Chols.

&gt;500% bonus to jump range

---
Only two Upwell Palatine Ansiblex Jump Gates may be deployed at a time in New Eden
---
Classy. 
---
&gt;By your logic you could argue every corp sucks in goons
---
I mean...
---
&gt; [...] did not know how to press adc.
---
Hey, pressing F1 is hard enough, you can't expect me to also press F2 *and* broadcast. ^/s
---
You can solo t4 sites in a retri. for arround 500m isk/h. Note that with the cargo space you will never make the same than running with friends. Also gila t4 is far better than vni ratting. go and try it.
---
For the lolz it would be deployed and connects to the system next door. 
---
Totally fair enough. 
---
I personally mainly just pvp and joined skirmish commanders and welp squad. I managed to mine and build a super before deciding to never do that again. So I’ll join locust fleets every few weeks and trade in jita, with lower volume things with acceptable margins.
---
Can I ask how you managed to get burned so bad? If you only dip a little into items you’re unsure of it’s very low risk.
---
I only ever lost that kind of amount trying to speculate!
---
Jesus
---
A mong
---
So why noone steps up and take some responsibility in the alliance?
---
You knew elo will leave again, it's just how it's always have been. 
---
Back to the dumpster with you Jason
---
You know i hear Rorq life in Deklain/ Branch is pretty great!
---
Search for that on our forum for details.. it’s blitzing missions in venal in frigates for high isk per hour, many people swear by it for how low effort it is.
---
When you have actual entities like Tishu who say “1488 gas the jews” in eve online, it isn’t in the realm of exaggeration.
---
GSF doesn’t tolerate culture like that. If the culture was so terrible/toxic, why would so many people be there?
---
You are 49 characters in a 30k+ Alliance. You are not special in any way lol.
---
Elo has never trolled anyone 50 times before. 
---
Unfortunately not
---
Where was the original one
---
A lot of people are commenting on preferences on how to split the shares, etc. but haven’t really commented on the other parts of your question. 
---
In high sec anyone can come to your moon and mine too since there’s not a real way to stop them. This means you should DEFINITELY mine from best to worst ores even if it means splitting up. Id also suggest doing shorter cycles that keep the moon a size you can mine out fairly quickly. As someone else said, boosts won’t help a ton with so few people but if you get more it’s worth considering. 
---
Try it in less active null areas, it’s pretty serious isk if you learn how to scan and hack a bit faster, blowing up the lower value cans.
---
Enter by wormhole (thera if youre lazy)
---
Its pretty hit or miss but can be amazing isk for the newer bros
---
As someone who has been in and out of Origin as I unsub/sub since 2012, this is just what happens  
---
Either you stop playing eventually or Elo does, and then the band gets back together in a year or so for a bit. It's just how BL goes  
---
Hope everyone had fun
---
You guys should do more stuff in J space to boost our popularity
---
That little repper had to be SPINNIN! I get 850k hp in pyfa (raw, heated, caps out at \~3minutes).   
---
wtf man, your ignorance is on another level.
---
They’ll mind lol
---
IRL&gt;videogames. 
---
&gt;However RMTing is one of those things that I will absolutely get salty about
---
relax, it's a game
---
&gt;RMT is, in fact, one of those things that actively harms the game.
---
less so than CCP itself
---
I feel like this is you demanding on thing because its what "I deserve" mentality
---
I loved his content tho, I mean I understand he has a job now but I loved watching his vids
---
INIT!!
---
Honestly if the alliance fails without him then yea they dont.
---
wait but muninns btw?
---
well, technically, that means Imperium batphone too :P
---
Ok your opinion there, I read the AAR and enjoy reading about events that are happening all around the Eve universe irrespective of where I live or are associated too.
---
Jonny who?
---
calm down issa game lmfao
---
the players kill the game faster than rmt does
---
Jonnypew, he was a big youtuber for eve
---
He deleted all his content?
---
Be kind, he has autism
---
Probably a troll but if it isn't:
---
stupids gonna stupid.
---
Are you blind?
---
Lucky for you, we can help with that! Our rental alliance is now accepting applications. Please direct all inquiries to Mick Fightmaster via evemail.
---
Somewhat tangential, but I think that in a way number of subbed alts also gives an indicator of health of the game. Many people only sub their alts when truly active/engaged and leave all but 1 account un-subbed until they really need them. So more active accounts per person could also mean more engaged single players
---
I support it, but not for this specific connection.          
---
It need to be a normal NPC gate as without it every friday someone will come and just kill it.       
---
This connection is for new people had chance to live in Stain.         
---
Older players have JF alts. 
---
not gunna lie i laughed really hard at this entire thing  
---
i was really rooting for him to have an EHE cause that woulda just been over the top

in the name of the uber lelz, yeah, would be funny
---
As someone who's ex Origin and BL with one dot, I genuinely would love to know what he does envision for BL, and why he can't seem to get there. 
---
Pretty awkward thing to do when you join a new alliance; warp to another titan at zero, bump him out, and get him murdered.
---
Have fun in TAPI to that CO2 Erebus lol.

no idea why people insist on fighting Sam
---
he literally LIVES for this kinda shit lmao
---
I see Brave building and flying lots of supers in impass
---
I mean, look at how many luxury yatches that fat cat Elo had. Clearly he deserved to be robbed by the proletariat.
---
And then there is rules that dosent work in alliance....
---
Brave's in a better position now than they have been for a long time, given I remember being evicted from catch.
---
Nothing says "You're being farmed" better than when your leadership literally makes a deal to provide a blob for PL to test their new T3 doctrine on in exchange for being able to stay in that space. (then a coup happens and you end up evicted anyway (disclaimer, could be remembering this wrong)). 
---
Was in brave back during the "This is eve" days
---
I eagerly await your fire sale.
---
I am willing to bet the other games you play aren't as old as eve. 
---
I don't think there are many of games from the same era as eve that will even still run on a modern pc. 
---
And considering when they first introduced Titans they thought there would be one or two in the whole game but we're so autistic that there's half a dozen in every system in delve now just gate camping or ratting. And fights bring more people into one system than the first few years of eve could ever imagine. 
---
Personally what CCP achieved with Eve is pretty damn impressive. But yes it's buggy as shit and the wheels are falling off. Nothing lasts forever. 
---
If they committed to a proper full rewrite I'd be willing to bet it'd take about 3 years. There's no guarantee there would be enough eve players left in  3 years to make it worthwhile. 
---
2019 and single titan kills still get posted in reddit 
---
We went in with 2nd titan, deblobed and went to corp applications ... and then they bumped after loong time. Why, I don't know. Erebus remained in the pos bubble avatar went out, once it lost the speed it attempted to warp to a fort however was pointed before warping off. 
---
It is however nice kill, congratulations.

RIP BL
---
How delete others post. 
---
100b estimated wealth? From a 1.1k member alliance? I’ve seen titans worth more than that. 
---
Whats more awkward is the fact 1 test titan was worth more than apparently all of BL's assets that got stolen
---
Hello sir I am interested in 1 Venal dreadbomb, PM me
---
He announced he will stop working on videos  and go AFK like... two months ago
---
Frankly speaking I miss Mr.Hyde's channel more, there were more PvP montages there...
---
I understand that you guys are frustrated but damn try to show a little more positivity that you are getting some direct feedback in regards to this. The op is saying he was banned for using a vpn, a cm comes to clear up that is not the case (which is very helpful not just for op but the rest of us who May have been spooked by this story). Like damn this is really good communication and I am happy to see it.
---
DO you know ?
---
Dreddit is Recruiting....
---
Who totally didn't expect this to happen?
---
We just literally lost a titan in TEST worth more than them

Lol did BL..**.** just died?

just checkin in to the ruise cruise

Might have to - whats your retri fit? I have max skills for it.
---
Quarter cycle? I've seen my hardeners and guidance computers keep going for a solid half cycle or more before stopping. Super annoying when you want to swap scripts.
---
we undocked, thought it was a crabbing op,  accidently killed titan.
---
Mistakes were made

honestly cant believe svet would do something like this, i thought he was a friend but i guess not

Don't believe you, deposit 1b isk into my wallet for proof

I was painting a Necron warrior at the time when i first heard the titans jumping in  
---
Had to try to put the paint away while spam pinging
---
Tishu isn't racist they had 2 black dudes
---
This is your fault dude...  If you would have been using your accounts to bot for a few years instead of using a vpn this wouldn’t have happened to you...
---
hold brush in mouth to keep moist while spamming those pings. The paint is non toxic, it'll be fine.
---
Gayops are afoot.
---
I'll buy your dread cache 50% off. 
---
He also stole all the open courier contracts to the freighter corp. I lost 15b, some guy lost 70b, it's a fucking mess right now. Not to mention that since he took the wallet, we are not sure how we might get people sorted out.
---
&gt;BL has survived without Elo before  
---
that gave me a good chuckle
---
An Aussie doing warhammer? What are you a millionaire? Imperial fists are the best though.
---
Stealing leadership/corporation assets is a time honored Eve tradition, but I've always thought that swiping line member's assets too was pretty scummy.
---
The trick is corp vs personal wealth, most corps tend to be pretty poor compared to their richer members.
---
It wasn't. That screenshot was just part of it, according to the [thief ihimself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/acfzvu/origin_drained_by_bl_director/ed7nhql/) at least.
---
Hey, Reggie here.
---
I'll get elo back. Give me a day
---
Yeah i feel the same way. 
---
You have to wonder at the 0rigin for all the malcontent
---
This is what happens when nobody else in the entire alliance can lead effectively. 
---
get out
---
Apparently not 1 of them can lead a fleet without him there so.... 
---
god damn
---
Suck shit.
---
Uncollateralized couriers
---
Not even once
---
can someone explain the context for me? ty
---
Join proper corps than cults of personality that will obviously fold when the personality with the attention span of a gnat gets bored and goes back to whatever it is Eli does when he isn't wasting people's time in eve?

Teach a man to fish, and all.

I'm not a millionaire- I have a local Games Workshop right around the corner- As well as a disposable income.

---
It's almost like pissed off members are quick to leak shit to sow additional unease in the ranks. 
---
yep, mistakes were made.
---
I mean to be fair this may have been all the corporation had but this is nickels and dimes to the average line member in origin. Usually corporations are broke. Yeah you may have drained it all but you didn’t farm any real tears here.
---
yea i generally go to one in either my suburb or go to suburb over in parramatta to order them

reguarly have good specials on

also painting 130+ guardsman gives you really bad cramps
---
It's all built up very slowly- But that Imperial Fists were that new battalion set that was out- They had one left for sale at my local GW, and I couldn't resist. They're no longer for sale anywhere.
---
Thats an evepraisal, what was the wallet worth?
---
but i'm not the director that did this
---
i'm just the worthless karma leech
---
Shit i got here just in time, let me pop my popcorn and get this show on the road. 🍿
---
Ah that’s fair I mean Elo leaving why not take what you can.  BL is dead, Muninn prices are going to tank now XD 
---
BRAVE spai confirmed.
---
i blame the Toronto meet up. a week after it, Elo goes MIA. must have been us. :(
---
Cause 100% is so hard to achieve completely
---
Tishu are "edgy" racists 
---
There was a gassing jews incident during an AT match also if i remember correctly
---
Memberships of the Goon swarm corp proper still requires SA membership or sponsorship by a current member. All the rabble not so much though. 
---
I miss his videos. Wanted to watch some old videos but he deleted all his content. Sad.
---
People like to think that misbrandibg us makes us mad. 
---
Anyone seen that photoshopped shirt that had Queef on it? It was on r/PsBattles but I haven't had any luck finding it again.
---
BL should hire gigX’s grandsons brothers 3rd cousin. 
---
I don't really get where this is coming from...
---
We blow up goons on a daily basis, and they blow us up almost as well. Most of the time we come out ISK positive, so I'm not really sure where this 'farming' happens. Goons have a content Fortizar 2 jumps out of Brave's primary staging for this exact reason. We like content, we want more content. We won't take *every* fight (if numbers are thin), but we take most. Goons sometimes send their fledgling FCs to lead fleets against us to train them, and we do the same.
---
Catch is the second-most violent region in New Eden (second only to Geminate), with GE-8JV (Brave's capital), and its neighboring V-3YG7 and HY-RWO as some of its most violent systems. We have daily fleets and have a ton of fun in our space.
---
P.S. Brave Newbies Inc. wants you to be Brave! Recruiting players of any and all skill levels ;)
---
Security do seem really poop in that they don't send any sort of response for weeks at a time. Even just an automated 'We're really busy and will look at your ticket asap' mail once a week would probably be better than silence. 
---
stop it.  
---
get some help.
---
still wouldn't solve the problem of who would FC when Elo goes away again.
---
To be fair I 8magine 3/4 of the office had Christmas and new year off and were likely only dealing with critical issues in that time. 
---
You underestimate the power of our Talwars.
---
Imagine the downvotes are more for the triple post tbh. 
---
what a better way to show that your not trustworthy enough to run logistics ever again but to steal peoples couriers.
---
I dont get what his vision for this version of BL was.  The piloting was decent and fleet #'s were really good.
---
It seems like their was no vision and he was hoping to just pick fights and win using Muninns.  The Darkness campaign went ok but it could have yielded better results if we took real ships when things started escalating.
---
The goon campaign had no plan to counter goons dropping Titans on them everytime they undocked.  That is all goons do... how can this come as a surprise?   I had assumed there would be some goal/plan to get around this and there wasn't.  
---
Also, Svetlana sounds like a butt-hurt little boy who's mad that Elo wouldnt be his boyfriend.  1T isk is a nice haul so congrats, but good luck with your longevity of this game.  It's hard to keep logging in when you don't have anything to strive for anymore.
---
65 from the origin wallet, 14 from the burner tax corp wallet, plus a whole load of shit from the jf corp couriers 
---
That's what she said 
---
2 snakes should be about 30 minutes a site, give or take. Introducing a third snake cuts it down to about 20 minutes, and a fourth to about 15-18 minutes (There's only so much you can do versus drone travel time).
---
Get a friend with an alt and throw in a third snake, it makes sooo much of a difference, from rolling holes to rolling anoms.
---
The many many tears in discord pms are worth more than the isk value of this. Elo never really left much in the hangars/wallet this was actually the most that's ever been in
---
really lost a lot of respect for you with this man, i get stealing the corp hangar but why you gotta steal line members shit? hope it was worth all your friendships
---
What is BL and who is Elo Knight? Regardless, it's always sad to see another new fc and corp burnout. 
---
i'll be his friend
---
You're right I'm gonna need to continue doing jf runs for isk with this 1 trilly wallet 
---
No collateral corp/alliance level couriers? What could possibly go wrong... lol, people just never learn...
---
Lol I wouldn't have the first clue how to spy. I've only been playing since Sept
---
you dad gave me aids ( ͡⚆ل͜ ͡⚆)

I've been playing for a very long time, I don't strive for isk or assets because I've had it all long before this shit went down. the only goal of mine in eve is to have fun and bl wasn't fun anymore. Also elo was my bf at one point and sent me selfies every morning so you're wrong

Is it worth spending \~$150? For the average EVE player, probably not. For those of us interested in cinematic video stuff, it's worlds ahead of what we've had in the past.
---
Lol faggot
---
The big problem is a good chunk of that isk is acquired via bot farms and compromised accounts, and not Johnny Rorq trying to make a quick buck using his own 'hard' earned assets 
---
And boy, you should really suck in order to get kicked from MC's last iteration.
---
It seems that it is good riddance for BL, if it plans to live.
---
As a frequent VPN user, I have to admit I was too spooked to log into eve after reading the OP. I'm glad I can go play now.

lol anyone who paid is an idiot
---
Imperial fists were always my favourite chapter (except for HH Lunar Wolves) but due to the outrageous prices I have switched over to other systems.

Upvote one, downvote the others?
---
Did you miss the part where his bans were overturned on review? 
---
everyone forgets elo has joined alliances before. he joined test, but his elgo is to big to be a fc, he has to have total control.
---
Salvaging siege/bastion-like module? 
---
Downvotes them all. Don't triple post in future. 
---
1b isk is ~270 rubles try to convince Igor and Boris to not bot when their babushka wants a new headscarf.
---
Looks like someone is not getting a shag from Elo this summer.
---
You should put some collateral on that contract
---
Yeh only 500bil lol chump change amirite (what) 
---
:thonking:
---
There is also another good thing about using an AB instead of an MWD.
---
Since you're AFK-ratting, as you said so, you also cannot get scrammed, so unless getting webbed, even with an attacker on grid, you still remain your speed and might have a better chance to either getting away and maybe even killing your opponent, or at least staying alive longer for backup.
---
An MWD and a scram means you return to your original speed, almost without a chance to survive.
---
CCP can end botting when they don't, so CCP losing money due to botting sounds fine to me.

To me most of the security provided by VPN comes from the fact that my traffic is obfuscated by other users' traffic. When browsing the web, even if you are using https like any sane person nowadays, the domains you connect to are still visible, and the ISP or anyone in the middle could potentially track them. Using a VPN that is shared with other users makes tracking of individual users' browsing habbits a lot more difficult since you cannot just track the domains he/she connects to.
---
Oh aye, I can completely understand why people do it, it's just the common methods I can't agree with. I'm not a fan of bots at all, but I'd rather that than the guys that get it from compromised accounts, though the industrial scale bot farms aren't much better in my eyes.
---
Knew a guy that used to do it many years ago (no longer plays) that used a small number of bots for it so he could afford to cover his rent each month, it's not something I agree with or like, but I won't rage on guys like that. Might put on my "disappointed father" face and tut, though.
---
Poor little you
---
Aye, I'm not defending CCP and don't care about the possible hit to their bottom line, that's their shit to worry about (or not, as the case may be. Subs are subs, I guess), it's the everyday players that get affected by it that bother me.

Yeah when we had a rouge director who stole a couple of 100B and swooped my stash of ships I was selling.  I got them back as it was nothing personal.  
---
Corp theft is 0 issues for the Alliance
---
The issue is it hits the directors of that Corp hard. I think I spent 80h to mark down what was lost and get a plan up how to get it back in order.  
---
That’s 80h I could have had fun.  So he basically stole my time.

If Jita chat isn't working how am I going to double peoples isk for them?

I'm hoping they will release the IF customisation sprew as small kits like other chapters- No doubt they will. That way I can expand my army eventually (maybe devastator squad/tactical marines) with matching shoulder pads etc.

WTB more silly fits to undock with.
---
If you're also botting, which is why you take the bait so easily, you should probably stop it.
---
you think faggot could really handle a big slug? 
---
Tell me more about how there isn't anything more CCP can do when people who get banned create new accounts to use ***the very same bot***.
---
Yup moons are now active mining. Annoying thing is that it put some miners on grid with a citadel rather than on a mining anom which can be a pain. It also reduced the one thing low sec alliances where fighting over since to actively profit from moon mining you need to mine them and mining in LS is kind of suicide (at least on the scale others are doing it). It also gave low end moon in .5 sec systems and in WH, so it increased a bit ore availability in those systems.
---
The new big thing is abyssal sites, which is an instance PvE thing. It bring mostly new ships, modules and ammo BPC and special ressources to build them. It's probably the most fun PvE Eve can bring. You can only do it in either a non-T3C cruisers or with 3 frigates. It also brought some 1v1 instanced PvP but not a whole lot of people are doing it. The new ships are great tho, they have increased damage over time. There are also mutaplasmid which can improve some modules properties, but they are either expensive or have a good chance to fuck your module up so it's not that big of a deal.
---
Wardeck were changed, you can only wardeck a corp/alliance which has a structure (be it a citadel, a POCO or a tower).
---
Structures continues to be revamp, jump bridges are now jump gates with no fatigue, including I think for regular caps (not supers). Same with cyno jammers and cyno beacons (there are some changes with cyno jammers like you can activate it in 5min and have 3 in systems (not running at the same time).
---
Ship balance in general is a lot more active and there was a pass over lot of things, FAX, HACs, ECM, T1 hulls.
---
There are no more stations in NS, they were changed to faction fortizars and players can unanchor them.
---
You went to Delve?  
---
When?  
---
Fewer
---
there is something called trust at least in most corps tho :D
---
Please tell me that you are joining goons now :D             
---
(not that i have something against this - but it will generate just so much outrage and salt that i need to get more popcorn)          
---
oh that pve stuff sounds cool, what are the ships called?
---
and yeah i knew the bit about fortizars 
---
There is like 7 new ships so you should probably check IG to have all the names. That include a new T1 and T2 logistic ships.

i mean the orca mines a bit too if you fit it for that and can help with hauling. you can track how much each person mines in m3/min and then track their mining time and payout accordingly.

if you mine at a moon rock you can use the ledger for payouts

there is no lowsex gate so please keep quiet

Ugh stealing this

Hope you will find other ways to have fun pvp'ing

By actually punishing botters outside of their publicity stunts. Look guys we are going after botters real hard see those we ported to high sec to die?

Meanwhile everytime you roam you see the same bots going 23/7 everyday for the last year with nothing being done.

Genuine question: who are these dudes? I've heard several names related to this corp (such as ghost legion), I've previously seen their presence in drone lands / cal lowsec, but I guess I never cared enough to ask
---
I’ve fought you a few times - or tried to get in range. Anyhow, hope to see you again soon. 
---
Hahahaha. Think I should stop now.
---
It wasn't my original intention, but after taking the origin hangars I started receiving threats in dm's so figured i'd just clean up. The origin hangars were pretty much elos personal stash so no one had lost anything up until that point
---
I see this on strip miner cycles. Really annoying.
---
Just don't give him roles...
---
The biggest stuff going on is probably the goon/test deployment to geminate, I’m not sure which side you’d want to be on but either will get you plenty of action 
---
Google spacedocking for more inspiration
---
Drone management level 0. literally the only thing to look at when flying the curse. 
---
Take procurers and an orca for boosts, either set up a buyback program or have everyone dump it in the orca and use the mining ledger to figure it out.
---
Nice work, I gave up on the game after they brought out those ugly assed centurions, but i've still got my full chapter of templars in pride of place. Mostly just do various  single minis nowadays.
---
I'm saving this comment.  It'll be useful later.
---
had...
---
see?
---
Oh no! They will actually have to learn to play yhe game now!
---
In all seriousness though, all these ex-ncpl corps joining snuff makes me sad :(
---
Its fine as long as you drive fast and eat ass
---
Brisc, gratz on partially fulfulling your csm goal of removing local!
---
Different times, this was before the 2016 capital changes that drastically reworked a lot of ships/mechanics.
---
At that time dd’s did 3m damage rather than the 1.5 they do nowadays and would reliably one shot most capitals unless they were specifically dd tank fit.
---
Well, someone had to do it 
---
Yes, yes there is. And also knowing you shouldn't give it to anyone in this game.
---
Yeah, I miss Mr. Hydes content so much. This was peak Eve and a great inspiration for me
---
I’m sure this disgusting behaviour won’t happen again!?

So, I am looking at running abyssal sites, but my gila skills aren’t great. I can use t2 rapid lights, but the missiles themselves have to be faction, and I pretty much all drone support skills at IV, along with gal and cal cruiser. 
---
Would I be able to do t4s at all with these skills with a fit under say, 600 mil, or should I stick with t3s?
---
 No one is shocked. 
---
lol tishu are in snuff now? 
---
Well apparently not for him
---
paying 100mil each - contract to StainGuy in any location.

Most of the big ones have corps with pretty relaxed requirements. Doing fleets is enjoyable with a good FC though and I would recommend trying fleets in null.
---
So is goons just a pile of 30-somethings arguing over who gets what rock? 
---
I think he is talking about Deelllvvvveeeee

I rationalize it (and explain it to my wife) that this isn’t just a game, but it’s my primary hobby. That lets me general get away with spending more than I would otherwise.

Wow! You think he's attacking you? What sort of victim complex have you got or are you just self-victimising in order to vaguely justify your pathetic passive aggressive attack on Brave.

Besides, you're a goon line member dude. You're not winning anything. You're just a sheep in a massive flock protected by a bunch of sheepdogs, bleating your delusions of grandeur. At best you're a dumb weapon in the hands of others. At worst you're a worthless peon climbing on the shoulders of those who actually are good at the game.

Ok but what PH will do without BL?

GMVA is still very active in Black Rise and Placid. So if you want low sec pvp just find some of our pilots :)

Ah ya I can see how that might helpful make the decision alright. Enjoy the mad isk;)
---
He expected flying about noobs in T1 cruisers and killing every one ... but he forgot that EVE is on Injectors now .... 
---
What? Elo is leaving again?
---
there were definitely a few comments a bit too close to the line
---
Yeah, sure you are not greedy. Ok, you want to stick it somehow to Elo and rob the alliance wallet. Why rob regular members, Mr Samaritan and totally not The Judge cunt v2?
---
I think the opposite. Null sec requires more work. WHers can just hop on, run some sites, huff gas, abyss, or PvP and log off. Of course, they can play all day too.
---
Time for the monthly BL attention seeking thread, they put more effort in to trying to jebait people on Reddit than they did in branch
---
What purpose do you have? It's a stupid question and from your comments it's pretty obvious you're just trolling. 
---
i'm not really greedy at all, i've been playing this game for way too long and have way too much isk. i just wanted to give elo the finger before i left but everyone else had to get involved
---
Not just that, Sigradius fucks you twice.
---
Your chances to get hit increases and the damage you recieve too.
---
I'm actually more mad that your shit opinions were on CSM for as long as they were.

I find it interesting that you are this mad at a guy you don't know, who did something allowed (and even encouraged!) by the game designers, which doesn't affect you.  
---
Everyone has a breaking point.  And a price.  
---
Are you getting Elo Penis Withdrawals with that kind of buttfrustration? Don't worry, Daddy's got another dicking for you in 2 years when he comes back.
---
.#kickinsu
---
If you're no Supercapital-pilot yourself after 15 years of EvE there is indeed something wrong.
---
Supers only need like 10mil skillpoints to fit in with T1, then farm skillinjectors with your Super/Tit and upgrade to T2 yourself.
---
Yep, BLFOX went to RDRAW and QCATS to GMVA.
---
Are you drunk? Thera has NPC stations.
---
I guess I'm winning Eve now too. I can't imagine going back to flying under average, mundane FCs after having flown under Elo. WTS 5 accounts.
---
Haha. I don't even know ppl from Origin, not have anything to do with them. I just hate cunts, justifying stupid stuff like that.  
---
And btw, isn't Elo welpign his titan or something, quitting Eve. If so, why woudl he care about the stolen assets and isk?
---
1 guy goes afk the whole alliance falls apart  
---
not f1 pushers btw
---
I GET IT, BECAUSE THEIR TICKER IS BBC HUEHUEHUE
---
Sad times 
---
Missed the vibrant aquarium that was lowsec
---
I never got valuable stuff from highsec sites. I have seen Johny Pew getting 400 mill drop in a site, but when i did the same some i got a 3 mill drop ... Thats just too random for me. Also there seems to be lots of competition, almost everytime i started doing some of the better sites like a vigil, some other cruiser warped in and tried it get the loot. In highsec you cant even shoot them to drive them away. That is just frustrating lol
---
no one but elo lost a damn thing until i started getting threats for stealing ELOs shit. if you want to get involved in our business i'm going to involve you right in the middle
---
Wasn’t that mostly Elo’s stuff?
---
Good luck rolling that Rorq out through your large statics.
---
Lol. Got 'em.
---
You seem awfully upset for someone uninvolved.  Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
---
It is not about Thera ...
---
because ccp deserves it
---
Elo is such a douchebag.
---
I can logout for 2 months and don't care about my stuff in NPC null space ... it will be in the same place where i left it.                 
---
Can you say the same?
---
Did any of the courier contracts have collateral or is/was there some retarded policy of no collateral for courier contracts so you could just break it and not care and get 100% profit?
---
I run them with faction anyway for range and faction drone for tracking (I think the only advantage T2 drones have is HP and cost). I pretty much have the same situation than you, I definitely also have some shield skill to IV (most importantly the shield regen one), and I don't have issue running T4 gamma.
---
Make sure to contract all the ore to Warmeister, it will turn into jackpot variety overnight
---
Oh sure, I just figured since the guy was so incredibly adamant about not being in null...
---
Cool story bro. I've always read stories about this exciting place highsec, but never got the courage to go and live there. :(
---
Well he is again on the wining side ... so kind of yes in a way         
---
        
---
&gt;How the once mighty have fallen
---
As a director and BRED I can confirm we are leaving.
---
the jf corp was a trusted corp of only directors and some dudes that had been around for a long ass time so they asked not to put collateral on couriers
---
I enjoyed his twitch streams. Had his own slant on playing eve.
---
That’s beyond stupid but hey they got shown why it’s stupid I guess
---
HI JASONNNNNKNIGHTKNIGHT!!
---
Get him some koolaid xD
---
Yeah, I'm retiring from reddit. I'm bad at this.
---
So you spent 72 hours baiting out 10B, let's see here, that's about 157M an hour to split between your fleet. Next time I'd recommend not letting the second Thanatos get away. Cheers
---
higher sig makes you take more damage. Your tank won't hold
---
true, but even though he was 'deployed' in Delve, we saw him like twice in 3 weeks...
---
More hookers and cocaine, less autistic comms.
---
In all seriousness each time he gets back less and less pilots will want to sign up with him. And the ones that will come back will be worse and worse. 
---
I think he still wants hac in a box lol.
---
I don't know what I could have done better there, the Gila just instapopped my drones whenever I relaunched them.
---
It's pretty common. Hell, collateral for shipping in GSF wasn't a thing until about 18-24 months ago.
---
Whilst it’s indeed try, it still doesn’t stop it being retarded in the current game
---
put them out. let them shoot for\~5 seconds. Pull them back before the gila has lock. and repeat the process
---
&gt; we undocked

If you joined BL without knowing it’s history, I understand where you are coming from. But if you joined knowing about it and choosing to stay, then I guess you had it coming. Just pack it up and go somewhere else or quit this god forsaken game like the rest of us.

The original one of this was an absolute 11/10. Anyone got a link?

Are BL pilots incapable of autonomous content creation? Is Elo 'budget Bjorn' Knight really that special??

There are better FCs, there are less pretentious and self absorbed alliance leaders out there who respect their dudes, there is more to life than Munnins...this guy clearly has a massively flawed ego and craves you lot pawing after him, yearning for him.

---
He's left the game. There is no way to 'revenge' him now other than this.
---
but that Gila was passive fit, even with that method, I would not have been able to break him at all. You should have seen how fast his shields regenerated. The first Gila was however active fit.
---
Do his boyfriends do all his announcements? 
---
I sexually identify as a blaster brawler.
---
I always thought it was dumb BL didn't have a proper alliance infrastructure.

Using origin as your executor corp was your downfall Elo. Next time do a holder
---
Could you put your fit/implants/drugs here? 
---
How much for thon's cloak?
---
No one wants anything when they can't take it in the first place... And yeah objectives in a sandbox, what a completely strange concept to have. Lmao
---
I dunno. I'd say the opposite. There is trust in very little corps.
---
Or you know, all these nerds can come to a non-blob alliance that almost always gets good fights.
---
Imagine ruining real friendships over space pixels lmao.  Pod yourself svetlana
---
[Take this fit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73698533/), faction up all the LSE, remove the amplifier for another faction LSE. No drugs, no implants.
---
having a second account plexed is a game changer, even if you only use it for market alt and scouting while they train. Having a third account is great, for a hauler alt and logi pilot. Then having like 5+ dps chars lets you take on larger targets. Add one account at a time.
---
The warpcore bonus kind of makes sense. Saves newbies from getting destroyed by elite rats or a hunter ceptor. The Venture doesn't have enough tank to survive any meaningful gate camp anyway.
---
I approve of this message!
---
Is 46km drone control range ok with that fit, and if not, how much would I need?
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
They quickly become unprofitable if you keep losing them.
---
Also, I notice you have a variety of drones. I’d previously just been using berserkers because of the resist penalty of gamma sites, when would I want to switch to the others?
---
No.
---
No, FXR prepped for 3 days.
---
I remember RGSU..... always causing drama and being cocks
---
Good riddance
---
Are there any kind of "hidden" tipps or tricks for Supercarrier, like having a Nestor to refit and several Hoarders with 3200 capbooster in Fleethangar?
---
Is there something I should get?
---
Any weird items like Mobile D.scan Inhibitor or else?
---
Should be good, i think I have 54 I think, that being said most stuff you're going to engage will either rush you or stay pretty far away. At worst you're going to loose some time getting in range, but that should be fine.
---
I heared opus was a big nazi, never met him so can’t confirm 
---
Rats have different resistance, but I have no idea what's worth it between lowest rat resist and the explosif hole from the gamma malus so I just use valk all the time.

Well GSF is not that it was 24 months ago.

To many miners. 
---
T2 Drones have better dps since they require Faction specific droneskills wich improve their damage by 2% per skilllvl.
---
Some faction drones require those skills too and profit of them, if I remember correctly 'augmented' drones do so.
---
T2 Drones compared to faction differ in specific attributes, you might want to compare them for yourself - most Astero Pilots for example prefer faction drones since they posess more ehp and therefore synergize better with Asteros Gallente-Hullbonus, making them way tankier.
---
I do take that as a compliment, thanks sir &lt;3
---
Tbh i assumed that the gate will be first.        
---
&gt; T2 Drones have better dps since they require Faction specific droneskills wich improve their damage by 2% per skilllvl.

Oops I though those skills applied to all drones. Well good to know.

self incriminating, reee

&gt;Yeah, figured other nerds might be interested
---
Fixed

They mostly came at night, mostly.
---
To be fair, it's very difficult to be attacked in HS space if you pay just a little attention to the value of the attacking ships / loot value rule, you also need to consider that not all the cargo content and equipment is dropped when a ship is destroyed (sometimes very little of it). All you have to do is to add some tank or make two travels. I play since 2011 and I have never been ganked in HS just following just this simple rule.
---
Just hope the remaining guys reform something better and new instead of folding into the existing blocs. 
---
No worries. He' ll be back in about 2 years.
---
You can check under Info&gt;Requirements wich Drones need for example 'Amarr Drone Specialization'.
---
If this Skill is listed as "required" you get +10% damage!
---
If none of you has more experience with mining, join a bigger nullsec entity.  
---
Do not bother with highsec moons and even regular ores. It is a waste of time.
---
Yep. Had a similar pos setup in fountain when brave were there.
---
Goddamnit! Youre even odins call ffs!
---
I see this all the time and I just want people reading aware of the actual numbers.  
---
Damage (total) goes Aug&gt;t2&gt;navy&gt;integrated&gt;t1 however aug and integrated deal two damage types
---
Survivability goes Navy&gt;aug&gt;t2&gt;integrated
---
tracking goes Navy&gt;aug=t2&gt;integrated&gt;t1

Its the HP and tracking is why, not damage.

---
+10% is if you train it too V tho
---
too many neuts, much scary
---
I used to do heavy botting - here’s how I would deal with it.
---
1. Have a program that can track the mouse movement of all accounts
---
2. Release a statement saying all botting and accounts related to or have repeatedly benefited from botting will hence forth will be banned.
---
3. Bucket up all the accounts that have repetitive straight mouse movement (botting macros work on straight lines of movement, humans can not replicate that consistently, even accidentally)
---
4. Have a small team investigate those accounts and ban them + those related to the accounts. 
---
5. Maybe 1/1000 accounts banned might be real. Take that initial hit and work out how to avoid in the future.
---
6. Actively keep on top of new botting techniques 
---
If the initial mouse movement tracker is possible, the rest can be done. It just depends if It really is a high priority for CCP, however I can think of several reasons why CCP would want botting to continue.
---
Haha you are a dbag svet.
---
We have sigs deployed to Gemi and corps elsewhere, at some point you need to sit back and stfu dude

Whoever is Nick Webber or Oskar Milik in real life, can you please send me a PM on Discord? 
---
I wonder what was it that he envisioned.
---
So I came back to eve after about 10 years, and what I did was join a newbie friendly corp to learn shit again. They didnt have wormholes when I played so I went to a wormhole corp. My best advice is to just act like you just bought the account and are brand new to the game. Also the groups that the other guy mentioned are NPSI meaning they are traditional corps, they are public groups that do public fleets, anyone is invited.

You could always become a non-average, exciting FC yourself ...

Those of us that play eve and are legally blind and use memorized mouse positions to find things on screen would end up being banned if this method was used.   Nice idea but ...

TISHU is an edgy memelord corp who got in trouble with CCP a few years back when they put 1488 Reactive Gas in the cargo holds of every ship they used in the Alliance Tournament
---
It is exactly what has kept the game going for so long.  Through all the balance issues and what have you, the lore and the game world remain something our species will never see again.
---
I should also add that there is a playstyle--market trading--which can be played without undocking.  (The old saying in eve, when people bitch about dying, is "undocking is consent to pvp".)  However, even in trading, the market is entirely player run and so you run into economic pvp of the sort you would see in a RL stock exchange, people buying out your orders and cornering the market, undercutting you by fractions of a cent, and so on.  Winning at it is probably the most lucrative profession in any videogame ever, in terms of the RL-convertible value of the game currency.
---
Wow. And literally nothing can be done. The trust took all the risk, and the thief has no burden. Seems a bit broken to me, but that's none of my business.

Def.  a possibility.  But if he is trolling,  he has been very committed to it.  And for what?  *shrug*  Fully willing to admit he is a troll,  but the larger point being (and I'm sticking to this)  that RMTers deserve everything they get,  and more IMHO. 
---
    
---
CCP is faaaar from perfect. But EVE is one of the best,  longest lived,  MMOs around,  and RMTers damage the game and its ecosystem.  Troll of not,  I am unapologetically (cringeworthy,  even) salty about them.  I fully admit it.  Ive invested my own time,  money,  and passion into EVE over the years - and RMT is something I consider a threat to that investment. 
---
isnt it like, suicidal to run lvl 5, you want to use a carier in npc null ? or how is it working?
---
He came back online several days ago and is now considering his options  You can find him in the Club Deadspace, as you always could. 
---
and people say brave are bad...
---
If you don't want to join the null blob and follow people around, mission running systems. You'll need combat probes to scan down the mission pockets while someone is running them or has an MTU deployed there.
---
I'd be shocked if the vast majority of the alliance fund wasn't in some director account instead of being in the corp wallet
---
I'll make a collage later 
---
Ha
---
Sorry but thats hilarious
---
recruit the members?
---
honestly we haven't seen much of BL since we moved back to gemi. so not much change. 
---
If you don't mind can you post the fit/which abyssal you run?  I don't normally do the pvp stuff but that seems like a strong ass fit if it can, with a bit of luck it would seem, poop on an ashimmu.
---
No, you're a moron.
---
The V-3 gate in GE- is the waiting room.  Form a fleet, fly to Catch, take a number and have a seat on the gate.
---
Someone will form up to fight you shortly.
---
You guys have no right to complain. Most here are for the open sandbox and freestyle freedom that anything can happen and anyone can do whatever at any time. This is part of the game and you all love it. 
---
Thanks Captain Obvious!
---
you will need a cloaky astero, but if you stick to sansha space you expect to average 150m/hour. Ofcourse an astero is a loot pinata so there is competition and bubble camps, log off traps, most of which are easily avoidable if you learn how to.
---
&gt;does the increase in signature also mean the npcs have a higher chance of hitting me? 
---
Yes
---
&gt; I understand the signature increase.
---
That seems dubious.
---
~~Don't worry guys, i'm sure BL will come back stronger than ever!~~
---
(Until they disband again)
---
Can you send me some Isk for being smart enough to not rejoin during this last reform of BL lol
---
Good bot
---
Stop posting. 
---
Nope, they tried to invade Genesis, we fought them off and pointed out some poorly-defended null space. Guess they joined SO now.
---
I never paid much attention, but I guess I always imagined CSM as a group of actually intelligent players that were there to help the development.   
---
Apparently I was wrong.  Jesus Christ.  If these are the people advising CCP on the direction they should go, no wonder its gone to shit.
---
CCP's stance towards botting can sometimes look lax from our perspective, but bear in mind that their security team is 2 people (IIRC) and even then, those 2 people prioritise chasing down account hackers over botters. They are probably already implementing what you describe here, but not to great effect simply because they don't have the manpower that they need.
---
Nah fuck them too
---
old but gold
---
&gt;But also most of them require PvP participation ;)
---
Not true, you can join a renter group and have no obligations at all. There are also other groups (Horde for one) that don't specifically place requirements on you in regard to pvp. You are however massively limiting your own abilities and game play by not learning at least basic pvp tactics and making yourself a more appealing target to hunters and a less appealing corp mate.
---
I mean i can understand someone getting butthurt over it because the internet is open to the general public and some of them are fragile and sensitive, and ccp doesn't want to be seen as endorsing that kind of behavior in their publically broadcasted alliance tournament, so... 
---
But yeah it was a p spicy meme
---
Well shit, I guess there isnt much you can do about that.
---
Wish you luck with achieving a resolution o7
---
Oops, meant orca drone *buff*, not boost. 
---
Rorq mining with shiny drones (and Rorq drone *buff*) is a big thing though :-p
---
You do know you're playing EVE Online right?
---
Why would you do that? 
---
So it’s not a high priority as stated - but would the above work if it were? 
---
Honestly more power to you from the sounds of it him quiting was the death of the alliance anyways had you not done it someone else would have maybe even him login put everything into his own hanger the. Never login again.
---
Trash mango autism

Yeah they appear to just be dog treats for training imperium fc's and new pilots tbh. Funny how they moved down south to be a strong independent alliance only to end up blue to everyone and sucking goons dick. Should not have expected more.

&gt; botting macros work on straight lines of movement
---
I guess it takes like 5 minutes of bot-dev time to add noise to the straight lines, creating human-alike mouse input.
---
&gt; Actively keep on top of new botting techniques
---
The state-of-the-art ideas of player wisdom I can stumble upon in this sub truly astonish me.
---
&gt;⁠Have a program that can track the mouse movement of all accounts
---
Is EVE botting really so primitive that this would work at all? Randomized input was standard feature in 2005 bots in RuneScape (including mouse moving in between clicks and while idling).
---
Don't you kick people with dictator like abandon
---
Are you implying that ccp listen and act on opinions of the csm?
---
Botting accounts have to pay 4x more to play.... this will help pay for the Games Infrastructure!!
---
Have you already founded and nameblocked the Black Legion.... alliance until the next return? I'm at work can't check.
---
Mouse movement in between clicks and idle times are normal in botting - wouldn’t stop straight line movement getting picked up 
---
You're welcome, I try to be helpful or I'll get sent back to the basement again!
---
Everytime I type Black Legion into my search bar it turns into Boys Love please help I swear I don't know why this happens
---
lol desperate 
---
Resub to Eve Online, Now with 50% more bots! Get this incredible deal before we break more stuff! PLEX PLEX PLEX
---
Your guess would be wrong, it’s harder than that lol - The working of the bot would still work from straight line movement
---
The state-of-the-art ideas of players’ wisdom I can stumble upon in this sub truly astonishes me.
---
We are! 
---
&gt; after taking the origin hangars I started receiving threats in dm's 
---
Who woulda thunk people would get mad at you... lol you're a piece of shit...
---
I support you in your morals / desires for the game’s future, reckon that guy is just being attention seeking though. But of course, who knows. 
---
The first issue that sticks out to me about this is the massive amount of extra lag that it would cause. currently, things like mouse location etc are all handled client side because the server doesn't actually need to know where the mouse is at any given point, only that a command has been issued. (and it really doesn't even care if it was issued with a mouse click or with a hot-key) This is also why, no matter how bad tidi gets, your mouse still works just fine.  
---
In order for ccp to track mouse placement, that would all need to be migrated to server side, which means instead of needing to process a handful of inputs per minute it now needs to process 60 inputs per minute regardless of if anything important is being done or not. which would cause a huge amount of extra strain on the servers, it would also mean that when you are in heavy ti-di, moving the cursor would be affected by it as well which would be infuriating at best.  
---
the only other way it could be done would be to install a keylogger type software that monitors the mouse location both in-client and out of client an then sends that as a package to ccp. and I don't think I need to tell you the absolute PR shitstorm it would cause if they included a keylogger.

That’s a good point, I didn’t consider the lag from the input/package send. Would it be enough data you think to really affect play? I would have thought it would only be several kb upload per few seconds

Explosions are fun regardless of who, when, or where. If something is going boom, its a good time. Its okay though, not everyone gets it. Just keep rolling into GE- and increasing our fun/hr :D
---
Dude PL will never disband. Or go away. They might not be the big “super” power house if their former selfs but there still a lot of good pilots there.
---
That logi wing was useless anyway, if they couldn't tank 10 people.
---
Mouse wouldn't trave along straight line. Mouse movement along randomized curve is trivial.
---
Ur a faggot 
---
It’s not trivial to work that into a bot program - nor do any bot programs I know do that 
---
There's a big difference between adding noise to straight lines and the way a human moves the mouse.
---
Because there's not enough Spod in delve to go around

I know they are his videos to do with as he pleases, but...

Honestly, I think that's a bitch move. I have an old YouTube channel that I don't update at all any more, which has a few semi-popular videos (20k-100k+ views each, a few of them). It's not a great channel, but they're there for anyone who wants to see them. Why delete/set all the videos private? Let people enjoy them if that's what they want, even if you are not making things any more.
---
make it 350 and we have a deal.
---
Says the guy tryna hold hands with me 
---
On my specific case is not; i checkd already. Because sometimes i receive in less than 20 sec and sometimes 8 hours, normally inversally proportional at the downtime, i assume they daemon to send mails not function or is not feeded and when fixed, send the past hours remanent. I use a similar system for send non critical mails in the night via sendinblue.com ( but this is sensitive, enter or not in EVE is their core business )
---
How is he going to sell them all is the real question
---
'DrLivingston'
---
Youre right, you totally are. Especially the last part. But id like to figure that out my own way. I learned that I learn the hard way the best haha. I also wont fly such expensive ships that it would matter to me. Atleast not in the start. Because PvP is still coming at some point I guess. Just wanna take it slow and go for the marathon and not the sprint. 
---
Did not know about renter groups though. They basically pay the biggies for space and safety or something? Interesting for sure! Thanks :)
---
ermagerd - delet!
---
Sadly it is true. If you try to run them in frequented places people in gilas and jackdaws will come after you like some zombies to get the loot that is often only an overseer effect and faction ammo. I did plex my account from doing this for a few months, so it's not that hard, but today I find ecploration more lucrative. Yes, neither of the two activities are providing a steady isk stream, both are heavily rng dependent.
---
I didn’t kick anyone in a long time (with or w/ reason). Even took the blame for when Eonan went crazy. 
---
When your entire alliance is a bunch of Elo cultist dipshits? That's a writeoff, abandon ship and leave the screelords to their fate.
---
All those T1 cruisers jeeesus
---
What system is this corp located in? Definitely not asking cause I'm hopefully coincidentally in a corp called Origin
---
Do bots open their character window and rearrange skills, show info on stuff all the time, talk coherently in corp and local, alternate between key presses and clicks depending on whether they only have one free hand at the time or not (lol), fiddle with the market, misclick/double click/etc, forget about an account or three sometimes, play with staggered windows instead of a window manager, and so on? Cause humans sure as hell do most of those things constantly. 
---
I'm pretty sure ccp does mess with mouse movements on suspected accounts as a test though. Eve is the only thing I do in my computer where my mouse likes to jump backwards from the route it was on sometimes (not like a piece of hair in the laser kind of jumping), a couple times in a row, for a few days, then not again for weeks or months. That seems like it'd be a different sort of disruption for a bot, whether it reacts instantly and correctly or instantly and wrongly, than it would be for a human.
---
They need all those miners to build a low sec gate to Stain.
---
Didn't he get a proper job where being a super-nerd in a super-nerd game with a real world profile wasn't the best idea? Same as Hyde I believe - think they are both involved in legal stuffs, hence the total edits of their content. 
---
I guess I should release the recordings of your members coming and crying to us for surrender?
---
Thats it, clear evidence Evictus is exploding internally!
---
What a bunch of poors lol
---
Your comment deserves more than 4 upvotes, btw
---
But why though? It costs very little to add collateral to contracts and takes any need for trust out of the equation completely.

Why is this a thing with EVE channels? It's so weird

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Is that how the warden system works in wow? By keylogging? 
---
Son of a bitch, even 123B Titan Pilots run Relic sties...  (Probe in SMA with Relic Analyzer)
---
Didnt they double up im the past? Aka if you bought 6b ccp took 12 from you?
---
Were they disqualified from AT or what? Seems like overreacting to me, especially because it's not like they broadcast looting the wrecks on AT stream. No one cares about the cargo they care about the fights.
---
Besides CCP are the true racists here, how dare they even put that gas in the game! Racists!
---
Conference proc. not really a paper. Still rofworthy though. 
---
Hello, I was thinking to get into EVE but reading some steam reviews, some people saying the game is P2W at the moment, is that true?, and Is it worth to get into EVE at the moment?, I am looking for an mmo to sink time in.

Maybe

My guess would be they like mordus ships.

When you fail so many deployments you have to meme about failscading to be relevant, you are very dead.

thats exactly right they came to delve and FAILED. they thought they could stand up to the goons might we but crushed their spirit and now theyre MEMERS?? lol so sad. i stand arm in arm with my goon brothers GOON FOR LIFE
---
"Sir Livingston"
---
Those rouge directors will get you every time.  That's why I only recruit blue directors. 
---
I think dude was just tired of Elo and saw a couple hundred bill sitting around so he made his move. 
---
No it wouldn't they can send this over to a special anti-cheat server and correlate it later with module activations ( this process doesn't need to be real time other then data storage ). 
---
As for including a in client keylogger ( that is only logging if the window is active ), honestly i would be fine with it ( plus most people wouldn't be able to tell ) 
---
Yea there is exactly 9000 of us, real active people. not accounts that have been inactive since last purge anything. vOv
---
Gift me a nag? I blaze in venal and promise to welp it there
---
slightly longer version is that tishu put in a bid to compete before the alliance fell apart. when time came, there was virtually zero interest, so lex and the bois tried to ask ccp if they could withdraw and were not only told no, but that if they failed to compete, any members would be disqualified from ever competing again
---
so they memed it with shit like shield ashimmus, and brought the gas
---
nobody noticed until somebody (honestly probably a joe or jayarr alt reddit account because they couldn't stand the thought of their meme going unnoticed) posted it on reddit, which got falcon's attention, and a couple dudes copped temp bans
---
TBF they were shit in Spaceship Samurai too so not sure how they keep getting into places.
---
I get why you're upset. And you have a right to be.  But this is a huge part of Eve.  I personally think it's a great heist.  If someone yanked all my fake spaceships, I wouldn't stop being friends with them if I was actually friends with them.  Don't let your missing pixels affect you IRL... 
---
But Eli is so afk that he was fcing yesterday. Unacceptable level of activity.
---
I sexually Identify as an Garmur-class frigate. Ever since I was a little ladboi I dreamed of soaring over the stars dropping hot sticky loads of mjolnir class light missiles upon dirty non-desserts. People say to me that a person being a garmur is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install my 6249.7 heated engines, 45km range True Sansha Warp Disruptor and multi meta light missile launchers on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Garmur" and respect my right to kill from afar and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a frigatephobe and need to check your Super privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
---
Elos going away message was pretty passive aggressive at first glance
---
You need the data of mouse movement anyway to catch that, it's not that hard to figure out the curve generator, sure you can add random effects with a true random number generator. 
---
Plus it forced bot owners to run the client again in place of the faceless botting interface most modern bots run. 
---
I spent a bit looking up the difference and I asked some of my friends and I'm almost kinda sure that you meant to say https but I'm not sure I'm not a web developer.
---
How do you even move all that if you steal it? 
---
Much appreciated explanation!! Seriously.

Are you being facetious in the last part about Falcon? Thats hilarious.

The system of EvE is based on Skill points, that grow with your time playing. There are modules that allow you to get more skillpoints to use more ships, or others. You must now two things :
---
\- having skillpoints won't make you play better, or win more at eve
---
\- you don't have the money on your bank account to "pay-to-win" at eve
---
Lost significant amounts of respect for SNUFF upon Adversity. being allowed in.

It's ok we love you

Am I the only one here getting hard because of Bongas Accent ?
---
I hear this salt spew everywhere, having lived near them and getting outnumbered ad outclassed in fights. I still have to say they were decently enjoyable enemies. Another thing I heard a lot, is not worry about elo because he will burn out soon and bl will shut down. Welp, even they were much harder to beat i d much rather fight them than the friendly family shitlords and see the pages upon pages of chest beating each time they pop a frigate.
---
Post it?
---
Didnt want those 8 titans 15 supers 31rorquals GOTG capitals anyway.
---
Uh huh
---
I don't have the message it was posted here

inb4 PC Gamer does another article on corp theft

thats like miniluv boasting about ganking freighters

Eve addiction is defiantly a thing. When I took  a break from eve, the game was uninstalled, BM's deleted and  twitter was closed. Really helped me have closure and move on in life. 
---
:blush:

"This Channel doesn't have any content" ? Looks like the PL Alliance Chat to me :/

Upvoting for use of "chode".
---
I don't think there is, the idea would be great. Tho I don't think there is enough staff left to do and manage something like this. 
---
Stain is pretty cool. Not as nice as Venal but cool.
---
Finally left hisec, got blown to shit  and uninstalled eh?
---
personally I think it was super unprofessional of him to behave the way he did in that thread, and I called him out
---
some people agreed with me that taking cheap shots and making snide remarks would have been okay if he weren't wearing a ccp flair and acting as an official representative of the company, but I got mega downvoted by average /r/eve choobs who couldn't see past "haha the ccp man made funny" to the part where racism aside, there's nothing stopping him from behaving exactly like that with their accounts on the line either
---
and since then there have been a number of other occasions where falcon has acted like a shit on reddit when he really should have taken the professional high road
---
I see those and I lean back in my chair and think about how nice eve was before falcon took over that job - guard was a fantastic cm and I guess we didn't deserve him
---
Sail
---
not quite. Warden works by sending information to blizzard about all programs running on a computer while WoW is open. It is considered spyware by most privacy advocacy groups. (and by definition it is spyware, but one that people need to opt in to through their eula which puts it in a bit of a grey area) so it doesn't track the exact mouse or key strokes but rather looks for known botting programs running on the computer.  
---
ccp could implement something similar with eve (and it would require a LOT less overhead than mouse tracking would) but eve players tend to be a bit more... reactionary... when it comes to things like that than the average wow player. just because blizzard gets away with it, doesn't guarantee that people would put up with CCP doing it.
---
Karma tank this!
---
Nah, the difference is, WAFFLES. can use a subcap.
---
So does this mean Black Legions war on Delve is over? Not that we noticed that much. When I mentioned it to a corp mate he looked dumbfounded because no one in Delve has noticed.
---
well, if french are not braggy they are not really french :D
---
Who would win Black Legion or Black Hand. Guess we know now!
---
b0pe were never mighty lmao
---
1. Supply and demand my dude. More people are attempting to plex accounts with potentially fewer and fewer people buying the plex from vendors.
---
2. Isk is much easier to get now than then IMHO
---
Make sure to list those members' names as well. We will force them to join you as a punishment.
---
That's because FXR is only comprised of french people. We french people in english corp, we have to suffer the contant bullying :(
---
&gt; dng managed to get in

fake doctored screenshot I can confirm we are disbanding

Talking about Eve Online is more fun than playing Eve Online when nothing is happening.
---
Most of the time I think "meh I'm going to log on and there won't be a whole lot of people to catch and kill" and 10min you get 3 kills and Eve is the best game in ever.
---
Asset safety to npc station, sell cap hulls to a null bloc that want a little cache, slowly move everything else out over the coming months
---
No, you have to fight for the french from the belly of the beast !
---
only if those are your alts
---
Good guys win again
---
&gt; retarded policy of no collateral for courier contracts
---
Things goons think.
---
&gt; It wasn't my original intention, but after ...
---
hahaha yeah right.
---
Oh ok. Back in the day I used to just run level 4 missions but now I've seen all this stuff about abyssal missions or whatever they are. Are these abyssal missions now the best isk/hour in high sec? 
---
The JF corp couriers don't have collateral? WTF. Talk about a shit system.
---
TIL Fedup has had collateralized shipping longer than goons.
---
&gt; cults of personality that will obviously fold when the personality with the attention span of a gnat gets bored and goes back to whatever it is Elo does
---
History repeats itself.
---
Lmao don't try to make excuses.
---
Just own it.
---
I would love to snag a nag from you.
---
Ironically BL has been one of the most active PvP alliances during the past 6 months and yet you lazy ass  krabbers  are here doing your usual shit throwing.  Amazing...
---
Lol, when we were discussing the Return of Black Legion in GSF the first thing someone said in Theta was it will last until Elo quits again. What pisses me off is black legion blew up a few citadels to claim the system for themselves and kicked out Out of Sight from Venal. We kinda just let it happen thinking BL would create some content and wanted to see where it would go. Just sad that our first instinct was the correct one. Oh well, guess we can have that system back at least. 😜
---
as if anyone give a shit if a random afk alliance die or not
---
incursions m8
---
Elo was fcing a fleet for horde last night though.
---
I can't up vote this enough. I had to legitimately ask if you were being facetious because there are so many Falcon fluffers on here I just wasn't sure.
---
I 110% agree honestly, I'm completely unimpressed with CCP Falcon and the way he trots around reddit spewing unprofessionalism. He pops in to make funny comments to people who tag him or talks shit about whatever and then when there's a serious in game issue or a serious post that needs to be addressed by CCP and people ask for his input he's no where to be found. 
---
The guy is honestly a self righteous douche and doesn't show an ounce of professionalism as well as showing plain opinionated favoritism instead of upholding a neutral position and doing his job the way it should be done. 
---
But then again what do I expect out of CCPearlAbyss in 2019? I do not believe they are in it for the players anymore. 
---
No thanks
---
~just EVE things~
---
You just dreadbomb titans that bounce. 2ez
---
Why a soda used to cost 20 cents back in the day but now is super expensive?
---
Reported for thinking if logging in 2019
---
Not really ran as much anymore, I ran them and was making like 500m + an hour in the hayday. Abyssal is pretty good kinda depends on the fit and such, Tier 3s are pretty good easy to run decent iskies.
---
make a alpha incursion alt
---
My comment is in no way a dig at any BL members other than Elo. Everything I have seen or read about him makes him a douchebag imo. The whole gathering dudes together and making something with them and then throwing it all away because things dont go as he wants is pretty bitch like to me. 
---
Four people hardly makes a petition...
---
Bots need plex
---
LOL
---
That and the whole thing with BL members raising money for him to go to EVE Vegas. That to me is the shittiest move on his part.
---
If Eve went offline, we would band together as a community and relaunch EvE from the very beginning all over again. What we fail to realize is there is no end to Eve, you don't quit EvE, the life cycle just starts all over again every 20 years. 
---
New players will come and say what is this amazing space pixel game and why didn't we have this sooner and it all starts again.
---
But for real though I really hope when that day comes we will have enough of a community to at least start up a private server 😔
---
correct me if im wrong, havent poked my head out of jspace in a while, isnt snuff being the bogeyman NCPL used to be? or are they just blobbing with goons and im taking reddit too seriously
---
Antici.........pation
---
We were under orders not to go suspect, so only the other suspects could rep each other, which was like three total scimis and a couple bantams. So, the suspects either warped off or died, and for some reason they never got a clear order to warp off. 
---
It warms my heart to see we have a place to stay during these tough times
---
But many of the recent fleets have been FC'ed by Sparton. Maybe Templis is also welcoming of refugees. :thiiiink:
---
What’s hisec again?
---
You are clearly the only person in the world who has given any thought to this issue, CCP should higher you immediately as their new CEO.
---
On a more serious note, stop saying stupid fucking things. 
---
Hm, yeah that's interesting and definitely in a gray area. Getting rid of botters would make this game healthier, but at what cost?  I think i'd be ok with it but it's definitely a slippery slope ie The Patriot Act
---
And yet the krabbers have far more idk wealth and ship wealth then they do.
---
Did you see the tweet?
---
&gt; lazy ass krabbers
---
Don't go judging other lifestyles mang.  
---
Krabbing can be just as much work as PvP, and is a pretty necessary part of keeping the war engines fueled.  
---
totaly right
---
+++++++++++++++++
---
MC last month, BL... this month, it s not fun for the north side.
---
Actual difference in my opinion is alliance objectives.  Waffles is working on rebuilding their raw numbers (I cannot/won't speak to specific objectives of their alliance), on the other hand HTP has never been interested in playing the numbers game and looks for solid individuals that don't want or need to play as standard line members.
---
incursions dont come close to t5 filaments, and id be surprised if they beat t4
---
in addition you dont have to run the same 3 sites over deal with the absolute fucking autists that shit up incursion comms
---
Funny that the second highest ranking Goon in the Imperium is Karmafleet that originates from Reddit. Goons don’t have to originate from SA or Eve. We play all sorts of games and if Eve died tomorrow we would just find another game and another forum.
---
There is not a simple answer, some of the increase is due to increased demand for plex due to skins etc being available for purchase with plex in the store, some is due to increased income with overactive botters and supercap ratting, and some is the perception that plex will always rise and people using it as a wealth store and traders manipulating the price ever upwards and enjoying the volatility of CCP sales to increase their margins.
---
It is actually incredibly unstable, and will balance on the knife edge until it doesn't, but no one wants to the the first to get out and miss out on possible profits.
---
IF it ever returns to much lower levels there will be the mother of all traffic jams of people trying to get out, and they will be horribly burned, but it is a very effective way of deflating the economy and wiping out trillions and trillions of excess Isk.
---
So be careful what you wish for, we might get it.
---
Nope. Wormholers have to scan everything and investigate their neighbors when they log on. Nullseccers logging on just have to check local before undocking their ratting or mining ship.
---
So it was just my luck all my asset safetys where sent to a low sec NPC station surrounded by gate camps? Cool. 
---
Always mine the most expensive ore first. Otherwise someone else may come along and mine it or the belt may just decay. The way my corp used to do it was everyone got to keep the ore they mined while the miners would tip the orca pilot.
---
I'll be honest, I fell for it.
---
I had 0 reason to believe that bl were doing anything but circling the shitter.
---
You can manually send them to a station or citadel that you have access to in the same system for much less time and much cheaper 
---
&gt; The goon campaign had no plan to counter goons dropping Titans on them everytime they undocked.
---
That's literally what we did to them when BL/PL/Tri/FRT/SkillU etc were all knocking on the door of Legacy space around the time of UALX.  There would be BL Muninn fleets in Esoteria every few days but after getting bosoned enough times the Muninn fleets just suddenly stopped showing up.
---
I run a handful of vni bots as alpha clones and they don't cost any plex to run since alpha. You just place the vni into a corps hangar nightly incase you get banned doesn't cost anything after initial setup.
---
We strive to be a place of brotherhood, understanding, sick kills and even sicker memes. Remember to pm me garmur pics.
---
We won’t have the code to run private servers. Companies rarely ever do this. When Eve goes offline it’s offline for good and never coming back. 
---
When the krabs are so unaffected by that activity so they easily fall for the ruse... just how relevant is that activity?
---
:)
---
The wise say that any port in a storm is fine. But our port roleplays as breakfast foods so that's pretty cool.
---
They are a lot easier safe realiable consistent and you can do them on a alpha alt
---
Well you’re right at least haha! Outlaws will always be outlaws...
---
Blobbing with goons
---
"cheap"
---
you just meant shitty
---
Man... that stuff. That'd fit nicely in my hangar. 
---
Hmm, I wonder why EVE doesn't appeal to a wider audience?
---
Better watch out for a tool that can tell what is working...  The whole Game is a BUG dude😂
---
It was censored due to content deemed culturally insensitive
---
I know right... Kept thinking hmm could be fun
---
Maybe on a alt just for PvP though 
---
Can I have my Atron back? I put it in the alliance bay for safe keeping and that was my only ship...
---
Lol did I hit a nerve?
---
Do you guys need a loan?
---
&gt; I used to just run level 4 missions
---
Most people just run anomalies in NS with VNI/rattlesnakes/carrier/super.
---
what fuck no delet this

Actually one thing did change in that in 2018 we had a Cultural Revolution in that anyone doing a pub or wave was to be ostracised and laughed at and so on. Anyone calling their character a toon will likewise get torn to shreds and so on. There have been a few who needed a re-education camp or gulag.

Aye, when i joined corp i made in 3 months way more than corp made in taxes in 2 years

Wow you bee guys are really cool huh

Allegedly that's what happened here. I assume he was broke, bought the 6b, and then went to -6b after they took it. you know, meaning 12 was taken, just a guess tho.
---
It’s basically always been like that for me. I’ve picked up Eve for a month at a time once a year for like ten years now. 
---
The idea of the game is so engrossing but man it sure is shit to play. 
---
That's shitty, this is part of what makes the game exciting. None of that "canned hunt" style economies and player organisations other games use, that reduce risk to such low levels that it feels like playing independent rounds of an FPS game.

I sexually Identify as an Barghest-class frigate. Ever since I was a little flatboi I dreamed of soaring over the stars dropping hot sticky loads of mjolnir class torpedo beats upon dirty waffles. People say to me that a person being a Barghest-class frigate is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon in thailand install my 4500 m/s AB, 3  additional Chessur-approved Feathering(TM) nanofibers and a penis on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Hit or miss-chan" and respect my right to dabbing dubstep and pancake needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a flatphobic and need to check your Garmur privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Why would you do this?

I know we've got this external reputation, what with the local spam and all, but dng is quite usually one of the more organized, disciplined, responsive, and responsible groups in the alliances we join. 
---
We activly push for coms discipline in fleets, only ever show up in doctrine, usually bring a disproportionately large amount of logi pilots, and find our own fun when fc isn't there to hand hold. 
---
I know I'll never dispel the mythos of dng but the internal operation and culture grooming is something I'm proud of. 
---
&gt;Do bots open their character window and rearrange skills, show info on stuff all the time, talk coherently in corp and local, alternate between key presses and clicks depending on whether they only have one free hand at the time or not (lol), fiddle with the market, misclick/double click/etc, forget about an account or three sometimes, play with staggered windows instead of a window manager, and so on? Cause humans sure as hell do most of those things constantly.
---
Sure, you might do all those things when you're at the keyboard, playing the game. How many of these things would you do while you're doing a Sanctum, or mining, or completing a Faction War site?
---
Can you tell the difference between player behaviour and bot behaviour, when the optimal (i.e. most strongly rewarded by the game) behaviour is to be completely AFK, doing something else?

And there are several reasons why CCP would want it to continue also. Honestly, CCP's best move for themselves is to do what they have been doing. Act like they want it to end but benefit from the revenue that comes with it. Every ban wave is a new set of accounts - strange that they haven't changed their method at all.

You need at least two omega accounts to use capitals unless you’re in Delve. One is your cap pilot the other your cyborg alt. Personally speaking always have your cyno alt. Don’t rely upon others.

---
I love this game. go downvote me to oblivion if you must, but there is nothing else like Eve on the market. If ED or SC would have real player-driven empire building then maybe. But as far as I know, there is no "single shard" persistent universe scifi MMO that largely relies on player actions rather than NPC actions.
---
Try 1.6b+ for a month of sub time 
---
Oh, don't kid yourself. It's still coming.
---
how upset are you about it
---
Never said they couldn't exist. Just said that our objective isn't "take your space and blow up your structures" and for some reason lots of people in the major blob alliances find that totally inconceivable. You all talking about our failed deployments like we ever intended to take sov or blow up structures in the first place are missing the point and being _really_ smug about it.
---
&gt;  you're no Supercapital-pilot yourself after 15 years of EvE there is indeed something wrong.
---
&gt; Supers only need like 10mil skillpoints to fit in with T1, then farm skillinjectors with your Super/Tit and upgrade to T2 yourself.
---
I have a few points I would like to make here. First, I have a character that can pilot super capitals; however, I fucking hate capitals generally and at the time I left super caps were floating coffins. So I own one carrier and one dread--and I have no interest in even flying these really, and I have been too lazy to sell them. 
---
Having said the above, you do realize that there are *many* old bitter vet or otherwise Eve players who have no desire at all to ever own a super capital right? 
---
Second what is the price of a Titan these days? According to Evepraisal the adjusted price of an Avatar is 65 billion. I am just going to conservatively guess the Molok's isk value is twice that. So 130 billion. 
---
You do realize that the *vast, vast majority* of eve players, including most of the ones who have been around 15 years (I would need to liquidate *everything* I owned to get close to affording one, and even then I'd probably be 40 billion short), cannot afford, and will not ever be able to afford one. 
---
So, the number of people who: 
---
1. Have enough isk to afford a faction Titan is going to be very, very low. I would hate to even speculate how low;
---
2. The number of people who are important enough in an alliance to be 'gifted' one of these at a significant discount is going to be even lower;
---
3. The number of people who fit into the above categories and actually want to waste any of their capital on a faction Titan is going to be *even lower than that*;
---
Therefore, back to my original point. You want CCP to concentrate their effort on adding a Titan that somewhere between 10 and 20 people, out of the around 100k or so people who have an active account, will ever get to use. 
---
Great use of CCPs time and energy imo (this last bit was sarcasm). 
---
merry crimbles!
---
gotta be honest i cant even imagine doing this. Literally the only reason I still play this garbage game is to play it with my friends in my alliance. If I stole what my alliance has there'd literally be no point because immediately there'd be no point in playing. But you do you man. 
---
This is a topic of much debate. At first glance, the game seems terribly pay-to-win. You can use real money to purchase monthly subscription tokens, and you can legally trade those for in-game currency, and buy any item in the game, or indeed skill points (the equivalent of levels in other games). So in theory, with enough cash, you could build a character with the same ships and skills as anyone else in the game, in a single day. 
---
And some people attempt that, and the next day they lose everything. Because this game is just as much about knowledge, and skill, and trust as it is about gear and levels. If your expensive ship is destroyed, you don't just get another one for free - you have to earn it all over again. 
---
Even though the option is there, I almost never see anyone commit more money to the game other than paying one or several monthly subscriptions. So I'd say that technically the game is pay-to-win, functionally it is not, and it doesn't behave that way. 
---
Yes _this_ time was a ruse but I'm sure _next_ time you'll be right
---
I still see it coming

- Increase in demand for subbed accounts for skill farming and AFK mining (thanks, injectors)
---
- Increase in amount of ISK that can be easily farmed in nullsec (thanks, dumb anomaly mechanics allowing chain running). Botting exacerbates this but it's multiboxed legit players AFKing that is the real inflation driver
---
The ISK fountain/sink is totally out of balance and CCP are too scared to nerf zero-effort nullsec fountains.
---
The term P2W doesn't apply very well to EVE. Since it's an open world sandbox where the players determine what happens, there is no endgame to 'win'.
---
When people talk about P2W they are talking about skill injectors. Injectors can be bought from other players with in-game currency, and they provide a quick infusion of skillpoints to advance training which otherwise takes months or years. This is a nice time saver for the impatient, but it should be noted that tons of skills are not necessary to enjoy the game.
---
Given EVE's open-world nature and the emphasis of strategy, experience, and teamwork, having loads of SP is far from a guarantee of success. New Eden is littered with the wrecks of nerds who thought they could 'pay to win'.

Thinking about taking the fight does not give me the shakes. Thinking about having the right fit for the fight does not start my blood pumping. Thinking about being at the right range and applying the scram at the last second as the hero interceptor kites off and warps out does not make the kill happen . Thinking about waiting days for the right moment to strike does not make the sale. If thinking about grand strategy is more exciting I suggest you step off the wall and get your knuckles bloody because that is the fun part.

I'm currently a 3rd year PhD, but planning to go into industry after graduation. While it would be nice to stay in academics and do teaching and mentorship alongside research, so much of our funding and job security is dependent on the political climate of the state and federal government (at least in the US). Going to industry seems far more stable in terms of paying the bills when the largest funding bodies and employers within my field are all government entities.

There are cultural differences in the way people speak, if you think that's bogus, you're a dumbass, even Obama, the whitest sounding black man on earth is obviously black if you just listen to the inflection in his voice.

It’s not income positive to use those on a small rat”* The pilot, who will remain unnamed despite the ease of finding the loss on zkillboard, then fitted a smartbomb on the 4^th along high slot of his Drake-class battlecruiser, unaware of consequences that would come his way.
---
&gt; During a Level 3 mission in the Eglennaert system, disaster stuck when a Cheetah-class covert ops frigate approaches him with its cloak activated. *”I was using the smartbomb and it was great, small rats would come near me and I’d destroy them and without using any ammo either! But next thing I new, I had a suspect timer and my ship just exploded around me.*” 
---
&gt; The covert ops frigate proceeded to loot the remains of the Drake’s wreck and warp off. With no insurance payout as a result of the actions, the player was left with only the money he had saved up since last purchasing T2 Heavy Missile Launchers earlier in the month.
---
&gt; “*I might buy a Covetor and just AFK mine near Jita, it seems like an easy source of money to get me back to where I can run L3s again.*”
---
I play D&amp;D with a group of Americans online every week, and have done so for over 5 years at this point. I only recently learned that one of them is black.
---
Why are you retarded 
---
Sure, if I want to fly a Blackbird, Kitsune, or Scorpion to get that range... But my rook/falcon and widow are done for. I mainly flew the rook.
---
I play EvE for 2 years now on and off (started early 2017), havn't owned a subscription for most of the time because I'm sometimes more active in other MMOs like WoW, GW2, Maplestory, LoL etc.
---
Got about 38mil skillpoints in subcapitals as I started again last November and now im up to 47mil. Got myself skillinjectors and a Hel with money made from salvaging. One mans trash is another mans treasure.
---
I pay for my subscription 15€/month because I want to be able to quit and exit any moment.
---
I really dont get old pilots who got stuck in poor environments with years in EvE-time and maxxed out skills.
---
Don't be poor!
---
Last time I checked an Erebus hull was about 46bil , Factiontitans are a lot worse since their Blueprints  are rare as fuck, Molok costs about 500bil for bpc alone - fitting on top you can guess Titans will cost about 80~100bil, at least thats their estimated value on zkill.
---
Supercarrier are cheap tho, paid 12bil for my Hel and currently flying with T1 fighters. I'm getting about 80-90mil ticks and am currently in the process of fitting it properly.
---
I really don't have much time to play but I plan on getting one of those famous warpspeed Nyx 180mil tick whores with damage instead of tank next.
---
I joined Goonswarm to win EvE online.

Wasted a year of my life with lowscrubs in c5 wormhole.

If you've been in a large corp for 10 years, you start to know the people you're flying with, who they are, what they do for a living, their ethnicity, their accents, where they're from, none of this is kept a secret.  There's a profound lack of black players in this game.  I can attest to this with 10 years of first hand experience and getting to know my corp mates.  We have literally 1 corpmate who jokingly says he's the only black player in Eve, and there's over a 1000 players in our corp who never correct him and speak up to say otherwise.  As far as I know, he's the only one that's ever played Eve Online, someone correct me, thats why I'm posting, I find it fascinating.  
---
best vid 2019 right there
---
Assahh duu is a lot better than Bssahh duuu. By at least, a letter grade. 
---
Well of course not now, but when you only have limited slots, and you should run a minimum of 3 jams at least. Your tank options are extremely limited. Before you could make up for it with your jams, now you have to sacrifice one or the other. 
---
80% of the game is all the drama going on within it.  And, honestly, I think we all love that about it.
---
I'm sorry I don't know how to click on links, i've been typing this entire time. Also do you pronounce your name Bjuice or Bjoes?
---
Mommy! No, wait. Daughter?
---
I think she prefers the term nighttime hardware operator.
---
&gt; Do you ask all the people you play with if they're black?                
---
                  
---
Please, I'm not socially retarded.  But on that note, we have over 1000 active members in my corp and we have exactly 1 member on coms every night who jokingly calls himself the only black player on Eve, no one ever corrects him and speaks up that he has company.  As far as I can tell, he's the only black player currently playing Eve online, someone please correct me or explain the phenomenon, I find it fascinating..  
---
I mean strictly speaking, Waffles are pancakes with abs. So if that's the case like, 90 percent of waffles are actually pancakes.
---
Exercise is hard okay.
---
maybe you should fit tank to your rook then 
---
&gt; Please, I'm not socially retarded.
---
Debatable.
---
Exactly 40 years ago my dad fucked your mother and I got your mom's DNA.  
---
Cringe 
---
I will not have you calling me pancake....unless you have syrup.
---
Idk, I mainly play in EUTZ and there is no distinct black subculture in most European countries, simply because there isn't a significant enough amount of black people living there.
---
There's two guys that I know from Eve that I know are black and I couldn't tell from just the way they speak. And then there's one American black guy who I couldn't really tell from the voice unless he got exited/stressed in a fight or something, just like you sometimes hear someone's foreign accent come out in situations like that.
---
Anyway, I was mostly joking. Three people among the hundreds I've met in my 9 years of Eve are almost nothing. It's probably just a subculture thing, you pick up the interests of the friends you surround yourself with.
---
Is this really a lot lol. For this size of alliance I pulled close to 450B from a small Indy Corp, and I actually left the members stuff alone. I should have made a reddit post a year or so ago for the free karma..
---
I mean, BL's the one running away with their dick between their legs, so...
---
lol, meme too close to the sun.
---
events like the AT and fanfest are CCP spending money to try to get publicity, both inside the eve community and outside it. they're promoting the game, trying to get stories published, and they spend non-trivial amounts of money doing it. guess what, if the story that gets the most attention is a racist holocaust joke, they're gonna be unhappy and you should expect the shit to flow downhill. any other game and those wouldn't have been temp bans.
---
people who can't figure out some basic things like this should probably just avoid being meme edgelords
---
I have 7 slots, 3 need to have jams to consistently keep one target jammed. 4 if I want to try and maybe jam 2 ships consistent. Then, I need to have a prop mod, so I have 2 slots left. Cap booster and Shield booster for tank. Still then you have no resists. Still no tank to talk of.  
---
Why not just get the CIA involved?  We can use spy satellites to peer into the minds of Eve players and determine if they are wicked or not.  If wicked, we send in SpecOps guys to eliminate them.  
---
About as practical as your idea.

---
&gt; Debatable.               
---
               
---
Lets debate.  If you think my question has **no bearing in reality**, go ahead and debate the case that Eve has loads and loads of black players.  Have you ever been to CCP fest?  Ever watched footage of the events where they pan the camera across the crowd?  I'm pretty sure you're about to lose this debate.
---
well yeah, that's the point. you're not supposed to consistently keep one target jammed anymore. it wasn't fun. fit tank, jam them occasionally to force them to have to decide between keeping DPS on their primary or switching to you.
---
So his mom's DNA was the only thing that saved you from being full on retarded?
---
Maybe a strong blue pill too. 
---
A lot of them don't, if I am to accept the entire risk of a package I want to be paid more.
---

---

---
everyone says that
---
I guess Deveron doesn't exist
---
It's p2w in the sense that you can get to use all ships/modules by buying skill injectors. But that will not give you the experience that comes only by playing, and playing a lot. This game is very knowledge intensive. The things you're required to know in order to, for example, do pvp is immense. You can be in a ship that costs billions of in game currency and have all your skills maxed but you will die to a veteran in a cheap ass ship who knows what he's doing. And it's worth trying it out at least. It's not a game that suits everyone, but you should try it. The first experience will be that everything is very confusing and impossible to understand. But everyone starts in the same position. Some quit the game soon after, others keep on playing for many years.
---
lol, great video nonetheless, imagine sitting there in a blob and a random ass rag pipes up and kills one and scoots away XD

Curious but unrelated to this topic. A bunch of friends and I used to play D&amp;D casually in person back in university days and are now looking to try doing it virtually (we're all divided by several hundred miles and a bit of time difference as well).

I know a few IRL who are into the sci-fi genre (one might actually play, but he's more of a friend-of-a-friend, so I'm not regularly in touch with the dude).

Just make sure every time something happens involving BL you show up to claim we're really failscading this time. You don't want to miss your opportunity to be right! 
---
considering how BL usually acts, i'd guess he's looking for a corp style like MC of old. traveling around from fight to fight and getting paid.
---
not very doable in today's era of large empires with in house fighting forces
---
black people don't exist you silly
---
"STEM major btw"
---
salvage if we can.....fking brave keeps stealing our salvage!
---
This is savage
---
Yes it's almost as if they increased range for you to be safer and ECM strength for you to need less dedicated modules for ECM and more for tank.
---
That kill was 2 weeks old?
---
Don't worry, I'm sure there will be more opertunities to be right....
---
Honestly I love Being the stiletto that lurks around the fleet then when I see an MJD go off or the fleet calls for tackle I warp in with 2600 scan res and fucking get him right before his module goes off and warp out as heavy tackle gets long points. It makes my heart flutter every time my 100+ mil ceptor. That's my favorite part of eve. 
---
I know goonswarm have had a fair share of director thefts :P 
---
I meant, its shitty that a few people reacted by going "a bit too close to the line" in terms of EULA when expressing their feelings about this theft. 
---
Probably gonna be some more opportunities to learn how to spell the word "opportunities" as well my dude
---
There's also the fact that you can do it once in a blue moon, meanwhile you can carrier rat 24/7 if you wanted to for the same income as very quickly cracking a bot.
---
And you are an illogical uneducated arse. 
---
Keep circling the drain, I suppose. 
---
Honestly the only reason I can see is if your going into a different direction with your youtube channel and don't want people to be confused with older videos. Like one channel I watch use to be a Minecraft Youtuber but now does live action comedy now.
---
But if you are just going to delete all your content then not do anything with the channel it just doesn't make much sense. You can still get ad money from older videos so it's just free money at that point.

When I dropped by bombers on that Assah astrahus you were anchoring wtf were you guys doing? Why did it take like 30 mins to even form a Ruppie gang.

How's your Corp or alliance that you run doing?  You can be both, and acting like you were 0redicting some that actually always happens seems dumb. Hey look how entirely predictable that sunrise was, look how good I am at predicting things. Here's a magic secret:  Every time hes been unhappy with Bl, Elo has shit it down.  Not seeing that as a good leader brings your own judgement into question.
---
Also before some stupidity comes out of your mouth, remember me and Elo were pretty bitter enemies as I say all this.
---
but then why didn't they keep him?

Hey mate I've just come back after 10 years with the same issue. Any chance you want to chat in game? Maybe see what we find regarding corp options.

I've been in many goon fleets that die in GE-, HY- ect. We don't always win. If anything I think it is a good practice region for both goon and brave FCs and members. Always GFs from both sides.

I've also been in goon fleets where were intentionally downsize our ship class because we know Brave doesn't have the numbers at that time and it wouldn't be fun, so it's a good community.

how about latinos?

dude, asking about race isn't something you do in a game. everyone is here to get AWAY from life and play as someone else.

ffs, theres more women than you think in EVE.  but quite a few of us prefer to be anonymous because of attention of being a "minority"

ECM ships can range tank. I do agree that drones need looking at as well - the 'drop EC-300s and pray' roll of the dice isn't fun in a solo/small gang engagement in exactly the way that ECM mods weren't before the change. And there does need to be a special case for jamming off fighters since it's pretty hard to range tank something that does 4000m/s.

4. Next time batphone TAPI if you're too wimp to use better tactics to take a fight outnumbered 
---
&gt;The worst part was that whoever created our doctrine Thalia didn't include a whoredrone, so I couldn't get on the kendarr kill.
---
I know right? Why isn't there a way for people to add stuff to ships after they've been fitted or bought of contract. CCPlz. 
---
&gt; The first issue that sticks out to me about this is the massive amount of extra lag that it would cause.
---
Nah, just have the client record the mouse position and send a summary packet (mouse position every 0.2s? that's 50 pairs of int-16s, or 200 bytes) every 10 seconds or something. It doesn't need to be keylogged, the client already sees the mouse if you're over it. The server side effort is recording them so they can be reviewed, and running some analytics against them to flag suspect accounts - processing power, sure, but it can be asynchronous and done off-cluster.
---
Ditto.  Haven't played in 4 years, still enjoy the propoganda and stories of epic battles.
---
Ahh yeah a fellow tackle pilot I see, godspeed.
---
&gt;BR doctor is broken

Your own BR link says 325 to 132.

Stop crying about getting blobbed on Reddit over timers when you're just as happy to do the same when it benefits you is all I'm saying.
---
Come join our jolly band of salty euros from when BL 1.0, we have extensive experience of overcoming Eloknight syndrome thanks to our TOBY Treatment (tm). 
---
Never seen someone sound so bitter after winning.
---
Nah. You can't kill ~~BL~~ Elo, not really. He always comes back eventually and stirs shit up for a month or two then leaves again.
---
They're really committed to the meme, though.
---
That's kind of what I expected.
---
If they are still moving the mouse manually once the cursor gets to the general area to actually select where to click, there will be detectable human movements. It might get picked up by an automated system but a human could see the difference. A (dumb*) bot will only travel in straight lines between a few select points.
---
That's a weird looking penis.
---
sorry to see BL go...and seriously fk TZ tank.
---
It is trivial, many free libraries exist that do exactly this.

&gt; local topped out \~530 with 60/40 \~ 55/45 on numbers in favor of us (panfam)

What the fuck are you smoking? [Local Scan](https://skyride.org/local/cMAYTpD/) \- 514 in local, 340 of them Panfam. It was 65-35 at best.
---
&gt; You guys midpointed 150 dreads, along with titans+supers, for some reason didn't commit them 
---
So did Panfam, to the P3 Keepstar with NC supers/titans 1 further mid out.

Would you like a kupo nut?
---
I have a feeling your parents should put you back into the supervised play program with the soft toys and picture books. Maybe you can come back to Reddit and try your hand at adulting again when you’ve mastered the basic linguistic capability of not sounding like a child who got hit by a fire truck when he was 5, and never quite recovered. Also at least try not to lick the monitor while using your keyboard, autocorrect will only get you so far.
---
You're brave, Hans is an epic shiteferbrains.
---
Someone will be along with new player copypasta but I would say
---
- Do the tutorial, it has some basic mechanics in it
---
- Do the career agent missions, it introduces you to most aspects of the game
---
- Consider doing the SOE epic arc, it gets you into flying combat ships
---
- Look for a corp or alliance that fits what you want to do at this point. If you don't know what that is yet then Eve Uni is a good bet - you can move on when you feel you've learnt enough from them.
---
You misspelled "ladiboi"
---
I got through the first paragraph. Man this is goin to be rich 😆 
---
I submitted a ticket. Unfortunately reimbursement was denied. The reasoning they gave is basically the same as if it had happened in a five thousand man tidi fight. 
---
Well you just let racism and bigotry into your alliance.  They're not just edgy, they have more than a few actual card holders, the rest feed into it.
---
They're literally trash people
---
Do you do everything through video comms? There's no way to tell what ethnicity someone is from their voice.
---
You can tell some things about their *culture*, perhaps, from accent. But I defy you to tell a modern, integrated non-white person from a western country simply from their voice, particularly if it's not your country.
---
Let's accept for just a second, just for the sake of argument, that every single black person in the USA (should we include people of mixed parents? To what degree?) speaks in such a distinctive way you can distinguish them on comms... are you aware that there's black people in other countries and that they don't have a distinctive subculture based on the colour of their skin?
---
I mean, there are a shit load of countries out there, and hardly any of them resembles north american culture in the slightest (thankfully).
---
tl;dr: You are seriously retarded.
---
It was super fun. I was tanking but the neut pressure from the Bhals was real. Was a great learning experience. 
---
yeah that damn goat hits like a truck sometimes :)
---
This game is more fun now than it's ever been.
---
No doubt. I love Catch, and if you guys are too big for Brave alone, Test often forms with Brave/Legacy to fight you.
---
I think everyone improves as a result, and it's a fucking blast.
---
At some point I realized I was dying fast. Then I realized I was cycling my MWD while not moving. Then I saw dread.
---
Panic mode on, maximum speed, run in circles. Close enough.
---
yeah was fun cya next time when you stomp on us o7 :)   
---
iam not shittalking here i like to win and lose in this game
---
you got it
---
That is some major bullshit --"
---
What were they told to do? Is it 'don't mine in that system'?
---
sounds simple enough in theory, but those packets being sent every 10 seconds x 31k online players (at this moment) means almsot 200k packets needing to be received and parsed by the server per minute.
---
not to mention the added processing that would be required client side, which your right, wouldn't be that bad in isolation, but considering how poorly the game already preforms in high ti-di situations its still that much more load making the game that much more unstable.
---
even outside of massive fleets, many of us run 10+ clients at a time, which again, just compounds the amount of processing required.
---
that's pretty n1 from you :) Thx
---
Meme
---
How much did you get paid to post this? 100k ISK? I'll double that.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
God no thanks.
---
Which is really just blobbing with goons... I mean, "Imperium".  
---
Hopefully, they got away safely. 
---
Can I get a small AAR? Watching from my phone so pardon me for not being able to clearly make out everything on grid, but did you guys just drop on a Mino and a Lachesis? Or was there something else that got away?
---
Hey, living with mom and having no one else to kiss is a life too, okay. 
---
Preach.
---
confirmed, i'm here for the zero sum \[loss\] game drama. 
---
Right, I wasn't inferring using their code. I was implying that we as the amazing dedicated player base we are will come together and wrote the code how we all remembered it. This time instead of spaghetti code causing bugs we will program the old bugs back in for nostalgia. 
---
Nah. There is boring stuff and can there can be a lot of "wait around to do nothing", but man when shit kicks off does it ever kick off. I agree to a point, you are definitely living moment to moment looking for your next high, but fuck me is it fun to experience and reflect on. 
---
If you really feel this way start taking fleets out. FC'ing in EvE is the most fun I've ever had in a video game, as well as the most challenging. 
---
I have not tried the explorocepter yet, I will have to give it a try.
---
Same. Love internet drama. Sick of spamming d scan.
---
So they even lose at reddit? LOL
---
I used to play with a very black person who sounded like a nerdy white kid, and one of my best friends in the game is a white dude that I had an entire corporation convinced he was black for many years solely because of his voice. 
---
I have played with quite a few black people, and people of many races, but it does seem that white people are the most common. Maybe you should just ask everyone what their race is and keep tally. 
---
Also what difference does it actually make? 
---
Your ceo is small af I guess dudes
---
Lol
---
I see another cringey "satire" website. Good one tho

---
Is the Supply Chain Management skill (and, I suppose other similar skills that did the same thing but for other reasons e.g. scientific networking) no longer region specific?
---
The description used to say something along the lines of 'can manufacture an additional 5 jumps from manufacturing location per level until at level 5 can do the whole region' and now it says something like 'can manufacture an additional 5 jumps from manufacturing location up to a maximum of 25 jumps.'
---
Fuck Elo for bailing on us without even a second warning. A lot of &gt;us burned our boats on the shore to come to BL, and you just fucking abandoned us. I should have listened, but I was blind. I hope you never come back to Eve again.
---
like no one saw THAT coming, unironic KEK.
---
I dont like to lose.
---
Holy hell dude you have not changed one bit since leaving GOTG yourself. Oh yes this guy was one of those " idiot retards like GOTG "  
---
Enjoy Hans don't come back.
---
Yeah we are playing the last edition,  fuck primaris space marines.
---
My current painting task is finishing my space wolf thunderhawk then last of my tau
---
If you aren't enjoying logging in you are probably doing something wrong.
---
Your logic applies to both situation and is kinda irrelevant. 1 person bringing 3 alts has the same effect whether there's 50 ppl in your corp or 500. It's going to skew the numbers regardless. It's literally the same effect.
---
Can't tell if flairbait or if a goon is _actually unironically_ being critical of the typical level of skill possessed by players in another null entity...
---
This only means you have cornered yourself into a safe but boring game dynamic. Liquidate most of your assets and do something totally different.
---
Then you need to find an elitist group of people that will let you F1 for them but nothing else

You first need a story to tell, not just a good guy.
---
Yeah emphasis on "was," i left because i didn't enjoy all of my fleets being structure bashes or feeds to GSF. Not to mention R3MUS US tz collapsed because we were stagnating too hard.
---
But please, more words from the commentariat who went to a dead alliance please. Get Clyde as well, if the same sort of bravado he has in mails carries over to a public forum...
---
I mean not to be the asshole but having watched Black Legion implode the same way 2(3 White Legion?) time previous to this implosion did you really not expect it to end this way? Did you really think this time would be different and Elo wouldnt completely AFG when he got bored or things weren't going his way? I can understand the love for him when he is FCing because he is a damn good FC but it probably isnt worth anyone burning bridges to go fly with him. I frankly can not remember Elo lasting longer then 6 months other then the first Black Legion.       
---
Sorry it did not work out for you though and the corp theft is always bullshit.
---
I would love to try this...are there any null-sec carebear corps that is safe? I wouldn't mind paying a corp tax in doing so?

lol I don’t think that would happen. Rewriting a game that large is a massive task that takes many many full time employees. Also there’s not many examples of a MMO being re-implemented after they go offline. Once Eve is offline I don’t think it ever comes back.

Here's how the 'elites' in Eve recruit...
---
"We're looking for new, mold-able players with 120 Million skillpoints and a flawless killboard with at least 1 Trillion ISK in dmg caused with less than 250,000 ISK lost..."
---
It does, &amp; I've already replied you bellend. 
---
So I'm returning after a 10 year break. Call me an idiot but for the life of my I can't work out how to just see what turrets I have sitting in my inventory that will fit in a certain turret slot. Thought it was all in this new fitting window but it always seems to be simulated rather than real, and there's no filters in the inventory. How do you just see what options there are for a component slot? 
---
About 3 months ago

Like stopping playing and just reading r/Eve instead!

Haha yeah. Fragged in such style.

was that after the whole Sort paying off Goons? Just curious, I have not played for a while but if I recall Boki was the 2nd man in GoTG, so it is surprising.
---
pap links for forum posts...
---
My grandmother uses Sphere3.
---
(On phone so fuck the superscript)
---
I guess you don't understand how participation is monitored then.  If 1 person brings 3 alts, that is 3 paps for either group.  For relative participation, that is 3/50 for one group, and 3/500 for another.  And remember, the relative is based off of forum accounts, not on characters.  So a small corp size such as RGSU with probably less than 25 real players greatly skews their relative number.  That is even stated in the participation thread.
---
One person getting 3 paps when there are only 25 people is noticeable.  One person getting 3 paps where there are hundreds is not as noticeable.

---
The client's already sending a vast amount more than one packet every 10 seconds. You'd get more value out of, for example, removing the blinking Neocom icons, for client side load.
---
The concern here is data storage and analysis.
---
WAFFLES is recruiting 
---
Who the fuck is ELO?

hh brother

billing is good, probably because they get direct money from getting people their account info
---
other customer service though is terrible

how do you know if you're never on comms
---
spoiler alert: the majority of people here aren't interested.
---
doesnt matter
---
I loved my time in BL tbh, fleets with Elo were some of the most fun I had in Eve... Sad to hear it ended up like this.
---
Don't lie, it's all the high impact joint degeneration from your gymnastics and ballet. 
---
Then why do you all seem so shocked every time it happens? I'm okay with it, but it obviously leaves zero recourse against the thief. That's my issue. You weigh the time and effort thousands put in and 1 thief can decide to be a dick and steal it all. And guess what, he probably was enticed by out of game profits he could make from selling it all. Yeah, that's perfectly fine. You guys are blind.

These days even many Goonswarm folks understand where the game is going. Although it took PL and non-turbokrab enemies to die, it's an improvement.
---
make your own subreddit
---
People that have the sense to put a corp/alliance/coalition down when it's better off that way then playing life support/suffering for months before becoming a shell should be respected. 
---
People just get upset that "it's gone" and "how can you be so selfish to leave after just making it." 
---
Also... Hasn't elo been running fleets pretty hard for over a year now? Do people not realize how much more time is in a fleet for an FC than just running it? How about all the fleets that don't get ran, but the work went into them just in case they did. That shit is draining and life consuming. 
---
If I make VO sound bad I'll be put back in the basement.

Our war with Tishu was weird. Both sides scrubbed the battle reports to make the other look bad, and I think we ended up fighting their allies in Hard Knocks more than we actually fought them.

Let the kid give r/eve updates on how this sub actually guided someone in a better direction.

Elo isn't a good fc. A good fc can be counted on. He is halfway tolerable when he is high. Other than that he is a man child throwing tantrums when he doesn't get his way.
---
I &lt;3 Brave.  Just make a fun T1 cruiser/BC/small stuff fleet.  They are one of the only groups where we can form, go to a populated system and wait on gate, Fort or KS grid etc . and they WILL usually form a fun comp to fight.  Usually great fun and I'm glad they act how they do :)
---
Also, if they don't have numbers, wait longer and you may wind up fighting TEST or Goons (or 3 party fun) doing the same thing...  it's great.  Again Thanks for GF's Brave
---
Made me think of grunts as f1 monkeys and that's good for a laugh. Thanks 
---
haha nice meme retard
---
Good luck, but I really dont think we need an update 
---
its even easier than that, just use an autoclicker lol
---
I had a similar situation but they asked me to reply to the support ticket saying I wanted 2FA disabled (which my support ticket stated already) and then decided to not answer for a few days.  So I started another support ticket to answer the initial ticket and it was quickly resolved.  They have their moments.
---
I would log in and spend two hours playing the game, log off and realize I got basically nothing done.
---
This was pretty much almost every time I logged in until I realized it wasnt the game for me. I love Eve and I love pretty much everything about it but the rate of reward per hour is pretty damn low unless you do pure PVP
---
Well, im in the middle of like failscade version 8.2 atm, so if we could survive this much fuckery, maybe you guys will be somewhat ok. Fucking sucks though that good alliances are dying and turbocrab alliances are bigger every day.
---
Yeah, most fun I had was in RvB. Great couple of years when they were most active.
---
I mean, every single time elo is in an alliance, it folds. Why anyone thought it would be different this time is beyond me. My only prayer is that elo never joins tri.
---
Rest in piss. BL episode 3 was fucking pathetic, a bunch of Elo-maniacs putting together the closest thing this game has to Scientology. Did you fucking weirdos pay to send Elo to fanfest, too? 
---
Your Language Arts and Social Studies scores are a direct result of reddit posting here.
---
Im going to let you in on a secret. 
---
The main reason our Catch Home Defence fleet doesnt deploy to other regions? Its there for home defence in Catch. Bit of an easy one that.
---
Why does Brave not deploy as an alliance? We have no need to do that at the moment. Alliances only deploy when bored of what they ate currently doing. 
---
When we get a weekend where every 15-30 mins a new fleet comes through it bevomes a matter of logistics. Why move your alliance north to fight PL, they whelp regularly in Catch. 
---
Why bother with going to Delve to kill Goons and risk Bosons? They are coning and fighting gf's with us daily.
---
Why Talwars? Throw 220mill worth of Talwars (20 in total.) at an enemy fleet. We wipe, get half an enemy fleet killed, we're still mad ahead isk war and we can immediatly reship.
---
Proper numbers or decent fleet comps arrive, then we stop dicking about, gey an actual FC on and ship into actual Fleet Comps.
---
But the major point is the salvage. All that sweet enemy salvage delivered free to our doorstep each and every day.
---
Think how much the Imperium ALONE gives us in loot and salvage, for the cost of a few Talwars?!!
---
Why do you think Salvager II's are on all our fits?
---
It's fairly quiet with a lot of highsec and lowsec moons, it attracts a lot of industry and mining corps. Was a little more active before Vastly Outnumbered showed up, apparently having loud and obnoxious neighbors makes the region less fun to live in.

If I understand you, which I’m not certain I do, there should be a little button on the bottom left of the inventory window. You can create a filter, and then select which a lot you want it to filter out/filter all but. Can also do this on the fitting window if you open the left window and there’s buttons for each slot. Hope that helps

Why not build your own sandcastle, or help a small group build themselves? I've always found that smaller corps give a greater sense of accomplishment, what with not being one of 30000 faceless gons. I like the feeling of responsibility that comes with that small scale, that sense that every action I take or don't take will affect the organization. It feels good to have a voice, is what I'm saying.

You haven't ever wanted to compare how big another mans prostate was to yours? 
---
To my knowledge, there isn't a way of auto-sorting through your inventory to see what you own will fit in which slot.
---
The simulation fitting screen is simply that - a simulation.  It allows you to see what you might wish to place in which slot given the entire range of things that might fit in there.  E.G. the simulation screen is an equivalent to the out of game fitting tools such as pyfa.
---
If you are actually trying to fit a ship, you need to know what you want to fit to search in your inventory to actually fit it.  So, you might use the simulation tool to see what could *potentially* fit there but you still need to go to your inventory to *actually* fit it to your ship.

---
It is definitely not p2w, having high in game skills or expensive ships isn't how you win.
---
Nothing in Eve should be a universal I win button. That's the problem with capitals and supercapitals. If you bring a bunch of battleships to a fight, it's possible to harass or at least escape it with small ships - that same balance should apply higher up too.

Either that, or capital ships should provide logistical and links support, but not be combat ships. Having a big fleet hangar, refitting capabilities (like the Nestor), a couple of command burst slots and a cyno would already be a big tactical value - but bringing 20 of them wouldn't be 20 times better, and we'd still have the actual fight being (better balanced) subcaps.
---
I hope the bitching about local being broken doesn't continue until it's fixed. Because that's looking ahead to Q1 2022, assuming that CCP Hilmar's incompetence doesn't lead us to a shut down server by the close of 2019.
---
Can you even imagine what these meets would look like. Half drunk thick palmed awkward mouth breathers jacking eachother off.
---
Amazing! 
---
Scanner definitely. Not just a combat astero/strat with probes, dedicated scanning ship with scan mids a faction probe launcher and scan rigs. Virtue implant set of you have it. Helps scan out chains way faster. 
---
Your preferred cloaky pvp ship, strat, t3c, astero w/e

DST/BR (DST more important if you can only have one)

A freighter alt to throw all your shit in should you randomly get evicted

Fuck you in particular for no reason

Poor Safoi got high blood pressure thanks to you lot.

Titans are the nukes of Eve: they aren't used to win wars, they're used to make it so wars never happen in the first place. #removesupercaps

The amount of salt in this thread lets me season my popcorn while I watch all the drama unfold.

Electric Light Orchestra, they're a band that was pretty popular in the 70's.  They're the ones who did Mr. Blue Sky from GOTG vol 2 a few years ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7dTBoW5H9k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7dTBoW5H9k)

Depends on how you play it.
---
Reminds me of a certain other legion, was it plague legion, something like that.
---
Is this what the spectrum looks like?
---
A+ troll mate, lmao
---
Anyways glad to see you guys are doing well and keep it up.
---
(please let me join r3mus discord as guest if i promise to behave)
---
The combat itself is fun. Finding interesting combat is a chore. 
---
Well I don't like your attitude 😞
---
You are welcome
---
Yes please 
---
Nice pod XD
---
you see, they were only pretending to be retarded
---
Spend a week with em. Those dudes are enjoying the game, which is more than can be said for most.
---
Thsts not 100%.
---
At least 10% of posts are shitting on PL.
---
Looks like you got a little asshole on your shirt there, mostly around the collar, sleeves, you know, the whole inside of it.

&gt;  Do people not realize 
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
He could have just made a pings channel right off the bat like literally every other pvp entity in the game :3
---
(Love you saf)
---
Because people want other people to play the game the way they think it should be played
---
I mean, i'd rather be only pretending than be _actually_ retarded, wouldn't you?
---
&gt;stares at TAPI flair intently
---
Amen.

And now I bet everyone is leaving the Corp faster than people leaving BL

Waffles having to put some effort into recruiting now they’re not the j4g route to Sniggerdly.

Na, reza is a super chill CEO. Also most of the directors are good guys as well. They gave me a second chance after all.
---
Nah, they didn't believe me :)
---
Blame ccp for adding broken features that they still haven't iterrated on meaningfully. eg skill injectors, rorquals, panic, infinite anomalies, citadels... 
---
2b and some footage I gotchu
---
christ
---
You could say the same for mittani worship.
---
because they want to make isk in the safest, least effort way possible. so when you get a few of them together, they try to change whatever group they joined to support those goals. if they make krab-friendly changes, they attract more krabs, who ask for more change to make things safer and easier.
---
continue for 15 goddamn years and here we the fuck are. 
---
good job jared!
---
 Aye 
---
I've watched half-decent PVP groups turn into nothing but krabs because of this. It's like a disease.
---
Holy fuck, you need to get laid.
---
I'm pretty sure that unsolicited keylogging is illegal in the United States...and many other countries.
---
Because in EVE, any gameplay style that isn't your own is either carebearing or cancer.
---
Go to Dreddit and find Vasic ;) You two will get along
---
Yep I am definitely tapi, through and through.
---
I feed hundreds of billions to kill a structure then claim victory for months on Reddit

I lose 100-0 in the first round of the AT and then claim it doesn't matter.

Excuse me while I go recruit everything that breathes.

subtext is mega difficult to the average /r/eve reader i guess? you'd think i'd have learned that lesson by now
---
I don't know what you mean, is that the test they had me do with the hard questions that made my mom cry?
---
Eeeeeeyyyyyy lmao
---
but you cant do that while watching a movie. So how is it better than AFK VNI ratting?
---
\*sweats in 29/60\*
---
&gt; rcarrier are cheap tho, p
---
There you go. So I have been gone for awhile, so I will take your word for all of this. Meaning, of course, coming in at 500 billion for the BPC alone, the original suggestion that CCP should definitely push out that Angel Titan even more ridiculous as since we are talking 600+ billion isk to build and fit a faction Titan, there really are like 6 or 7 people who can afford to buy one and want one. 
---
And do not get me wrong guys, I am not saying an Angel Titan shouldn't exist given that CCP spent time and energy on the other faction Titans. Instead, what I am saying is that such a thing really shouldn't be a priority... and lamenting that CCP has not done so yet, so it should absolutely be the next thing they add to the game, makes you sound like some real life Billionaire complaining that the government has not built the infrastructure, roads, and utilities necessary for you to build your private mansion on the moon you always wanted.

 The hate comes from the loud minority who think they're elite

people don't hate 'krabs'

they just think of them as lowly peasants

and as i pointed out - if people barely noticed, were they even making any explosions of relevance?

Better Vasic than Dravien

I'm like a magical unicorn Moon. I show up rarely, but when I do people stare and laugh at the gay pretend horse.

I’ve heard people say your chances of an escalation are greater running site in lower ship classes. Don’t know if it’s legit or not.

stellaris reference gets +1 from me

I feel it got better in the past weeks. Except Jita .. but nobody want to read that anyways.

 I have no need for chat I spend more time in the abyss than outside it.

15% Hoping for something.

5% doing something.

  Shush you

Fags that run on the sign of trouble lmao

Even if I believed what you are saying is 100% true why would you think that in a Alliance like Goons fucking about with another corps mining income would be acceptable?
---
And knowing the people involved in this sort of a decision how many time did RGSU ignore being told to stop?
---
yikes
---
After a long time away from eve I came back, living in WH.
---
The adrenaline still kicks in when I’m hunting someone
---
So, not buying plex makes you lesser?
---
&gt;Where does the hate come from?
---
an outdated mentality where people thought they were somehow superior to pve players because they did some irrelevant pvp.
---
you know, the same people now mining that guy with 30 rorquals mined all 4 of his own titans that just got dropped on their small gang and boson'd them.

Effort is good! It means you care about things and if you care about something and put in the work then things generally turn out alright, unlike this thread, which is a little bit of a dumpster fire ngl.

But hey, if it's not hurting anyone and gives people something to talk about it can't be bad right?

You’re right, high sec ganks take more planning and effort/skill.

Tbf the actual text is also apparently difficult to the average r/eve reader too, you spelled it out pretty clearly

---
Anomalies have roughtly 5% escalation rate (not sure if different anoms have different rates).
---
1-0.95^60 = 0.953
---
So not getting escalation in 60 sites is about equally liely as getting escalation in only one site.
---
TL;DR You are just unlucky.
---
That actor is amazing. He was in a season or two of  Lost and was also in 3:10 to Yuma. Probably a bunch of other stuff but those are the ones I liked him most in.
---
Downvoted for truths.
---
People who "exclusively" pvp often think, wrongly, that they are better than people who don't, or who do both. Its petty, pedestrian, and wrong-headed. It's the same people who bag on goons for crabbing/mining and call it "toxic gameplay". Its like crabbing has gone from something that shitty people do, to being a horrible scourge that must be eliminated for the good of the game.
---
If it were possible to detect ethnicity over the game or voice comms (news flash it's not) why would it even matter?
---
I had a similar issue. I could still log in but not reach account management. So I took a few relevant screenshots and had access restored in less than 20 minutes.
---
I might have mentioned that my sub was about to expire.

He is a rebel, and yes
---
Wait, are you telling me that there are mission runners who fit smartbombs in high sec? And all I need to do is scan them down?

please pm me

I'd rather neither tbh
---
I mean they seem to be sloping pretty hard on dotlan...
---
yo same
---
Why would we go anywhere?  We stay until booted, duh.
---
Similar experience here.
---
    I was locked out and got a reply within the first 24 hours. Unfortunately I did not specifically state that I was requesting 2FA to be turned off in my original petition, so the GM asked me to verify that is what I wanted. 
---
   I replied within a few hours, but being a Friday I did not hear back until Monday, or even Tuesday (I forget) I was a bit annoyed, but when I asked the GM for more game time as compensation he did, which more or less made me happy. 
---
I’ve never had a problem with CCP customer service. 
---
Some players feel they are owed spaceship fights whenever they deign to grace an area with their presence. When they are denied, this creates hurt feelings.
---
Well a solution to the problem could be to balance the fightings in terms of what ships each side brings to the field.
---
An example is that if SIDE A brings cruisers and SIDE B, brings battleships then SIDE A would get some kind of benefit for engaging, it could be a dps and/or tank or what evert.
---
That way smaller group could take on a bigger group and both sides would have fun and have something to brag about.
---
I also think a good solution to the citadel cancer is to make it more expensive every time you anchor a citadel and the upkeep of it.
---
That way an alliance  will think more carefully how/where and when to deploy the structures and not just dump citadel after citadel that creates timers that are not even worth attack nor defend.
---
But of course goons with all their power within CSM won't work against their own interest :)
---
I’m calling campus security 😂😂
---
Because the way i play the game is the god damn right way to play the game and people that use game mechanics that i ignore are god damn savages that need to play exactly the way i am telling them to.

Next step: community college. Seriously, they're effing cheap, the credit transfers to most universities if you go that route, and realistically they just want a degree, they don't care where you got it. It opens up professions, not just careers.

Preach it brother.

What did he do, refuse to post chicks with dicks in fleet chat?  We are what we are.
---
Summer camp wasn't that great for them

Bosons were a mistake.

Lets say I can take care of myself
---
Yeah, the "winning side". Krabbing and stagnation do not a "winning side" make
---
I should add: also if you enjoy trolling reddit BL is a great alliance for you :)
---
He said 10cm, not 5
---
I really don't want to think about what the worm is here.
---
Nah I believe that the lower rated sites had more chance of escalation?
---
Being a content creator, in this context, has nothing to do with Twitch.
---
The funny thing is that most of them are also krabbing, but in secret.
---
&gt;definitely
---
Nice to see the people leaving for goons and legacy lol, like they need anymore 
---
Up next: dertydan gets mod on r/eve
---
Damn
---
I read mm not cm
---
I think I responded to the wrong comment
---
Why is that? because they brawl against each other over LS moons?...something you should know about LS groups. They don't have issue flying with each other...and they don't mind going hope and brawling each other the next day.
---
Pretty sure this is CCP Falcon posting on an alt account, you can't fool us with your false praise for CCP!
---
Jeez that Bhal pressure was rough bro. Could you have held out for much longer? Seemed like you just needed some friends on the way (as it always is)

Certainly not your CSM years, due to the aforemention shitty fucking opinionitas.

We (PH) expected it to happen eventually but we loved out time in fleets with you guys. Come hang with the Beans
---
Which one?
---
oh thank fuck, someone lost a more expensive titan to cover up our ratting titan loss
---
Yeah... kinda hard when you aren't holding that Imperium cock in your mouth until the swelling goes down huh?
---
Good for you, wasn’t negging you - merely remarking that being under Graths sweaty bawbag was unhealthy for waffles as it created a certain attitude in *some* recruiters &amp; members that because you were the non vouch booshed route into Snigg they could treat players like shit. Now you are competing with Imperium’s free tea + titans for everyone offer and horde et al no interview anyone’s in policy you have to actually care about making your corp an experience worth joining rather than a place you suffered time simply to get your snigg call up.
---
It was hairy but I feel like I could have tanked it until my boosters went out. I have the rep power to out rep the dps on field. Was a matter of managing cap properly. 
---
Ew
---
I get that, but seriously, he isn't bringing much in the way of fights here either.  Literally, his alliance is a joke.  
---
The same was said about gigX, that he was a "content creator".  And the game is better off without him.  Black Legion is a shadow of what it once was, and Elo flitting in and out, never knowing when he may decide to play again, is no way to run an alliance.  Alliances that rely so much on a single person are just dumb.
---
or a fucking D-scan without context like LSH posted yesterday
---
The alliance name is french though 
---
Reddit vote PVP are where the real rekkimg shots are fired. You can always spot when you’ve been primaried and you can always tell who has the entire alliance vote Logi keeping them up. 
---
Would be better if those small skirmish gangs did more than just run the instant they might lose a ship
---
I don't want your stuff..
---
I mean we told you all in local chat, every single time. BL will fall when Elo leaves which will be soon.
---
No, that's data analyser.
---
when in miami or close by? 
---
Im not keeping up really, but from what i see on reddit is that BL has collapsed? 
---
Nah he is "elite" and likes to fly doing his own stuff, null bloc does not interest him. Said enough and will stop
---
Imagine trying to evict those TAPI retards, failing miserably, and then failscading immediately lol.
---
Don't mind him, he's gay.
---
naw, waffles is super chill
---
SC and ED aren't single environment?
---
Thats most likely cuz its the opposite of how BL is pur fcs are our leadership and fleetup multiple times daily. And its more fun and log in to shoot shit than i need u to build me my empire type of gameplay.
---
Or 5 titans DDing one mino
---
Hopefully just the frigate
---
Ok. Every alliance has certain levels of leadership who arnt Military or Full on leadership but are more like the HR of the alliance.
---
They are there to smooth feathers, putting out fires and stoping small issues becoming alliance destroying problems. 
---
They also, usually, have permission to make a decision on behalf of the Alliance to end issues. As Alliance members you are expeted to follow the decision.
---
In this case OP is trying to paint RGSU as innocent saints despite even his reason for them being kicked is probably the correct one for Goons.
---
But as the other poster said it looks like this issue was either repeated enough times to need a intervention by said HR dude or RGSU had been doing enough other shit that OP wont admit to that forced the HR guys hand.
---
Either way 49 RGSU players who wont follow orders for the good of the alliance they are already in or 699 Amok. players who are willing to follow orders isnt exactly rocket science.
---
Oh and in a Amok. Vs RGSU whos better for The Imperium the ratting, mining, manufacturing, buying, selling, sub-cap numbers,  cap numbers, and super cap numbers all favour Amok.
---
Sorry we don't speak Italian :D
---
Na main, we have perfected the crash and burn then turn into a mighty phoenix then crash and burn again cycle. We good.
---
Good luck friend
---
At no time did I say they shouldn't be kicked for what happened, they deserved it. I was just arguing with a random mid management spodbrain who claimed they contributed nothing while they were in goons, when facts prove otherwise. 
---
Yes but hours isn't really all that problematic.  With Eve we're talking months to years.  I just cannot stomach that.
---
ah, fuck me then, carry on.
---
Oh yes, the secret shame of farming for money in an MMO. How can these poor souls live with themselves.

To be fair mate u were 100% dead there for sure, u would’ve just drained boosters for like 10/15 minutes to die anywhos.. blows tho for sure.

If they generate PVP, the game is not "better off with them". Better off  for who?

Win: Feel Good

Lose: Learn Something

To be fair it’s the EU. They’re all subsidiaries of Germany now so nobody cares.

Well, that's one thing, but I mean online. 
---
They did and he took the money that's the worst part of all this to me.
---
yeah all timers should be set for the middle of ustz to ensure fairness
---
okay
---
And yet it isn't, seeing as Goonswarm is still here and BL is not. Again. On cue.
---
I knew a grad student who normally wrote in LaTeX. One of his advisors insisted that he always submit parts of his dissertation to them in Word. The reason? It has better commenting and editing features. At least that was the advisor's opinion. This was at a top 3 program in a hard science discipline. 
---
I don't know that I agree with it wholly, but I can see where they're coming from. Editing someone's tex file with comments, or adding comments to the pdf file, doesn't look as nice, nor have the previous version features that word has.
---
I know my own tex files are covered in commented out paragraphs as I've rewritten them and had feedback, but I can definitely see the advantages of Word and Google Docs editing features, particularly with shared docs. I know there are tex softwares that will do this, but none I've seen are as fully fleshed out as Office or Docs.
---
But nothing looks better than a well made tex document.
---
Looks like this is your first super kill. 
---
Congrats on being the initial tackle.
---
Ain't that the truth

Please come to catch! StainGuy you can come too! We love when salty dead alliances drop by to get dunked

January through December?
---
EVE has chat? 
---
Even some very special r/eve posters can´t get my juices running like a really tense PvP situation ingame
---
calling it offline might have been a mistake. you're still online, but it's single-player so the other players don't exist in your world until you join the public multiplayer.  You can also play "group" which I think is just you and friends but no others.  So you can krab and travel across the universe before joining the true multiplayer with all your safely-acquired gear.
---
They may have changed or unified the modes.  I didn't really like it so I never went too deep.
---
This is bait isn't it?
---
Hard Knocks was a shitload of fun until everyone owned their own c5 or c6 and couldn't be bothered to go 6 jumps for a super kill because they were busy prepping their bearhole. /rip
---
once again you're arguing in bad faith.
---
&gt;So, not buying plex makes you lesser?
---
no
---
what makes someone a lesser is someone needing to put in many more hours than I in order to gain the same amount of enjoyment I do.
---
It's the internet, you can say "fucking" 
---
Bang, gottem. 
---
Nope, they've still got the 3 modes - open, solo, private. They've added a ton of new stuff it looks like though.
---
Don’t be a lil bitch. 
---
Are you hitting on me?
---
"Getting rich is basically being a peasant." #goblogic. 
---
Dual box, either tanky web/scram bomber and dps ship (im a big fan of hyperspatial proteus myself) or sabre dps ship. If you're looking for pure solo that can also scan probably a nano arty Loki is your best bet, but that tends to be more a waiting game. If you want to scan with an alt, scanning and warping to the site cloaked in a covert ops and using that as a sabre drop in will get you a lot of kills.
---
"spending hours doing mindless boring stuff to get money" is being a peasant whereas i can spend a little bit of time pvping to get much more than 99% of the game is capable of
---
And i thought 7b br post from Horde yesterday was shit. Fk off TAPI.
---
Committed so much it might just come true
---
eh, or should be 1-2 days at most except for keepstars.
---
having tiemrs of 5-7 days or crap on astrahauses forts and so on. makes no sense.
---
As opposed to what, Cananada? 
---
Elo would do well in big bloc alliance like test or horde. Show up once or twice a month do something and go back snoring coke. Thats what he did when he was with us and was pretty good content tbh.
---
Thank you for your meaningful representation of goons, mr goon line member #5629!
---
What you got against wormholers?????
---
RIP BL. Such a shitty thing seeing a whole group fall apart like that. Kudos to the ones that really tried.
---
Italian and/or latin-american countries with big italian influence like Uruguay, Argentina or Chile.
---
Hey, when your social group vilifies a particular activity to the point of moustache-twirling comedy, there's some real motivation to keep closeted.
---
I have nothing but respect for them, very good pilots, and meme game on point
---
This mindset is what breeds loyalty, a sense of belonging to a crew of friends, and its what most lowsec corps are always trying to channel. Its the only reason lowsec has any successful areas.
---
I wish i had known BL was like this but Tidi is a huge turn off and Sov play is just simply not fun. 
---
Sorry for your loss honestly.
---
No that was your graduation
---
Crying about supers and titans dropping while you are in goon home space........:thonking: did I miss something here? Wouldn't it make sense to have a fuck ton of resistance if you are poking someone in their home? 
---
That's true that's why I left Horde. Then now my journey put me in goonswarm.
---
Are you aware that alts exist
---
The downvote brigade lol
---
The real reason is because it didnt use to be a must in order to compete in the game and nowadays it is, so people who enjoyed the game in its past state are finding it hard to conciliate with the new status quo, and most of them are either quitting or holding on to the game due to sunk cost fallacy, we all know a lot of old pvp players would've long quit if it wasnt for a sense of pride or rivalry towards other organisations, while many others have already done so.
---
For big entities to compete with each other they now need multiple rorqual alts and cap ratting, they need to actively protect and defend that production, and so on, and only the biggest entities can afford to have that ammount of manpower in the field at all times, so more and more newbies who are told VNI ratting or mining is the only valid form of income join those entities that can protect them and new generations of mostly PVE people who mostly quit withing a month of playing EVE because all they did was afk a VNI or watch a mining hold fill up and that was unfun, and then go around telling people EVE wasnt fun, thus reducing the ammount of players that come into the game, as has been happening for the last couple of years since these changes were made.
---
Of course, it benefits CCP in the short term because more and more people are getting more krabbing/mining alts to ramp up production and their wallets as its never been this easy to earn a lot of money through multiboxing, and each of those pays omega either through someone else (if they buy ingame plex) or themselves.
---
Personally I think its a shitty system and I dont think most people actively krabbing actually enjoy it. I do it and have done it in VNIs, carriers and I dont particularly enjoy it at all, it just gives money. And to me mining is even more boring. Only thing that can make mining not boring is having fun with the mining group you're in in comms and such, but thats entirely independent of the game itself, and you could have the same fun doing literally anything else with those people. You rarely see anyone proudly go "heh I've ratted 10 hours today, it was fucking fun", its just skinnerboxing with isk rewards, but thats the state of the game.
---
Someone does have to scan everything but after that it's in bookmarks or in your WH tracker of choice.
---
You should've submitted this to eve onion!

It’s awkward how many times you use the word awkward.

I don’t think he enjoys that though, which is why he keeps reforming BL. Elo come play Clash Royale with me.

stop fricking swearing

You're still suggesting that your enjoyment of a game is more valid than someone else based solely on activity choice.  
---
EVE PvPers trash talk PvE because most of them can't PvP alone (FCs), so they have to convince others to participate with them, and the most potent method for this is to troll someone?   
---
Hokay.   
---
99% of the game is PvP?   
---
No, it's not, or we would have run out of ships to smash years ago.

I suggest you create your own subreddit called /r/JaredDaleBlogging and post updates there.

The Astero is great for hunting explorers while also doing exploration. If you fit it nano, you can sig tank and hold larger ships while friends come in to help DPS. Astero vs Astero fights tend to be long, obnoxious, and boring, but active rep will eventually beat a buffer fit, unless friends arrive.
---
The Stratios is also excellent, as is any T3C, but you'll want a SeBo to reduce lock time. Instalocking Arty Loki is amazeballs for this. The Smokescreen cloak is expensive, but very helpful in reducing time to start locking. If you get a lock, they're dead.
---
Bombers open the door to killing Cruisers and Battlecruisers, but are very vulnerable to Asteros, Stratios, and T3Cs. Torpedo bombers work great, but you'll likely want want multiple painters for your torpedoes. Rocket bombers are not bad, but really take too long to do a job. Bombing bombers are hilarious when they work, but explorers have to be ridiculously obtuse to give you 15 seconds of flight time for the bomb.
---
I was recently flying a smartbombing Proteus. It was a load of meme-y fun. Warp in, decloak, and blam! No need to wait for sensor recalibration or lock time. No tank either, which means death is only a matter of time. Your target profile is pretty much haulers and exploration frigates. The Astero is a legitimate threat, the Stratios will usually kill you, and any other T3C fit will obliterate you. It's not really worth the time to try to catch someone on the wormhole or gate due to activation restrictions, so you'll want to catch them in the site. Also, you'll sometimes lose standings from the pirate faction if you hit the structures in their exploration site, then it despawns, which is amusing.
---
If you're not really solo, then a bubbler or tanky bomber tackle (no sensor recalibration delay) and an dps ship of any kind are, of course, overkill.
---
This has been my exact mentality for the past couple months.
---
I look forward to playing all day but when I sit down and log in I don't know what the hell to do.
---
Guess I'm gonna try to become an industrialist next?
---
Did our smartbombing cancer in Oulley and Aubenall make any of the pages? (Obviously imagine not, cheers on the work though)
---
nou 
---
And the relevance of bl seems relatively low.
---
Bombers apply shit damage to frigates. T1 explorer frigates can easily be fitted to kill bombers. If you still want to use bombers you should fit rockets.
---
Astero is probably the best. It can move cloaked and is good at combat.
---
If you want style points do it with T1 explorer. If you plan to only kill other T1/T2 explorers the fit is simple dps and dual scram. you can also attack asteros as many of them are not combat fit.
---
You can also fit the T1 explorer with something more unusual like dual MASB. That thing can kill poorly skilled and badly piloted asteros.
---
totes buddy
---
Yeah but it takes more time and commitment than most people have 
---
in 1000 players nobody can step up to fc and lead the group, fuck ccp, fuck goons
---
Could you guys like not fuck up my smart bombing with tidi in lowsec you nullpire parasites?
---
Imagine if Elo got so fecked off with Eve he RMT’d his character on eBay to some p2w nubbins. Then you had half of Eve’s elite playerbase fapping over getting into fleet with a guy who’s only Eve experience was capsule for cashfloweers and then NOBODY NOTICED. 
---
You sound like a small, angry little man.

It had been said for months...until elo goes afk again.  Not even a year.

&gt;You're still suggesting that your enjoyment of a game is more valid than someone else based solely on activity choice.
---
i'm not saying it's more valid, everything is valid. stop projecting.
---
Think of it like this: Why do you krab? Why do you mine in rorqs and rat? The vast majority of people do not enjoy these activities in and of themselves, but for activities that stem out of them or relate to the people who they do them with.
---
I don't need to do those boring activities, I can PvP and acquire more than 99% of the playerbase that do these activities.
---
&gt;EVE PvPers trash talk PvE because most of them can't PvP alone (FCs), so they have to convince others to participate with them, and the most potent method for this is to troll someone?

i never said 99% of this game is pvp, stop strawmanning/projecting

I was pissed off dude

maybe some people don't need to be """relevant""" (whatever the fuck that means) in order to enjoy playing the game

i know it's gonna take an extra dose of ochre to get your spodbrain around that one but I think you can if you try

Hmm I have look into that. Have to see if I have should to fly an inter. 
---
Purge Nidia. Someone has to take responsibility for these failures so it m9ght as well be the token management fall guy nobody likes and Gobbins keeps in reserve exactly for these eventualities.
---
I don't understand your point. We're not allowed to enjoy our fleets unless they are a frequent enough topic of discussion around our enemy's water cooler?
---
excelent news ralph. keep us updated, i hope you have a full (of cum) recovery!
---
Yes Hilmar.
---
If your going to blob at least use titans 
---
there's basically no reason for you to be able to choose both the time and day a structure exits other than to dissuade conflict. 
---
or do u just think it's coincidence that everyone times their structures for the enemies' opposite tz during the week?
---
No Deal Brexit ftw!
---
God it must really suck to be elo right now lol
---
I would personally like to offer some ointment for your butthurt.
---
very good news, you are blessed with genetics
---
As opposed to the previous model? In order to compete in the previous model, you needed to either be blue with the one group who had all the supercaps, or you had to outnumber them to the point of comedy. People like to harp on about how big groups aren't meaningfully assailable now, but they forget -- the big groups (or the supercap heavy ones, at least) *had nothing to attack because their heavy assets were logged off 99.99% of the time.* The structure of power back then was to hide as much of your heavy assets behind a logoff screen as you could, and only put forth the bare minimum amount of attackable infrastructure and ships to maintain your passive moongoo empire. Heck, the game mechanics encouraged this -- since you couldn't dock your supercarrier or titan, the optimal play was to entomb a dedicated character in the ship and leave it logged off in a POS.
---
The new system doesn't differ much from the old in that regard -- you either have to outnumber an opposing force to the point of comedy or have a ridiculous supercap advantage. The big difference is that in order to maintain that power, your dick has to at least go onto the table a little. You can't keep contemporary economic engines alive while logged off.
---
Yeah it sounds like the entire group is a bunch of cowards. 
---
How's drone walkers these days
---
Are there any reliable services in-game or on the forums for buying T2/T3 BPCs in bulk?

A strong independent alliance

If it was in October '17, it would have.

I have been away from the game for a while. But... Are nullsec structure timers still weeks long?

To everyone screeching at Elo- RL &gt; EVE. Instead of helping new FC's by joint their fleets, fulfilling important roles, filling the power vacuum- People sit there and cry elo's gone AFK. Suddenly someone steals everything not bolted down... Sounds like some in the wider leadership team simply wanted to ride on elo's coat tails while reaping the rewards - but then bail the moment they need to out some effort in.
---
  Good riddance.
---
  F to people who lost their stuff and ISK, some have probably decided to quit the game after that. Bravo.

Very relevant to the conversation.

Love it.

And screw BL
---
Wasn't Svet also AFK as fuck from the game?
---
Its true that you cant keep contemporary economic engines alive while logged off but my point is also that only big organisations like TEST, Goons and PH have enough people in their roster to be logged in 24/7. The meta has never been friendlier to having as many people as you can on your corp/alliance as it is nowadays, and organisations that were already big in numbers by the time these changes came along are coming up ahead while corps that wanted to stay lean found out that their playstyle is trashed more and more.
---
I hope it isn't *too* easy to regain access if you lose your 2FA, otherwise what's the point of having 2FA in the first place? But glad to hear you got your stuff back quickly!
---
Obligatory reminder to everyone to back up your 2FA keys in some manner, even if it's just writing them down on a physical piece of paper.

You can run two clients on one monitor.

A measily 105 bil in ships? Came expecting more of a loss, more mad brosefs, more salt.
---
Left disappointed.
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
Is it the reason Elo is afk?
---
Most people who use a lot of T2/T3 BPCs in bulk tend to do their own invention. But if you'd rather outsource the work you should be able to obtain a supplier and a preferred rate easily enough searching for what you want on contracts and EVEMailing the owner.
---
Represent like a vegan or a crossfitter
---
pvp man bad
---
Economic engines don't stop if you and yours aren't connected 24/7. Not sure what you mean by that.
---
Wanting to be a particular way isn't a guarantee that the way in question is or will be viable. Hell, GSF has played the way it does (empire building and sov having over everything else) for its entire existence, despite it being sharply sub-optimal for all but the last two years of the game's existence.
---
The only thing that doesn't have a decloak targeting delay is a bomber. But a bomber is made of paper and applies badly, so an astero or even a well fit T1 explorer will probably beat you.
---
T3Cs or Strats are quite common ships people try to use for this, because they're covops and can actually guarantee the kill if you get the catch.
---
If you can cloak up in the site then an interdictor will probably work. You might have to wait an awfully long time for someone to bite on your site though.
---
I like to mark a warp-in while cloaked and come back in a destroyer. That doesn't have a great success rate though if they're paying attention to their dscan.
---
There is literally no way to balance around number of pilots each side can field. Any attempt to would only be gamed to give the larger side a greater advantage.
---
At one point in the game time was the limiting factor, time to train. While time is still technically a factor skill farms have made it redundant. 
---
N+1 is all that matters.
---
show bobs and pp
---
no i don't think it's a coincidence, i think that people from a whole bunch of different timezones play this game
---
dang.. wormholers always get it bad.  #greatpost
---
You can create custom inventory filters, so you can make one of those for high/mid/low slots.
---
CHKM8 except for a couple of FC's were basically useless the whole war with goons, with pretty much the whole corp including Boki going AFK. 
---
Nobody was sad to see them leave.
---
If you want to know where the game is heading just look at Serenity. 
---
taken from your calculator?
---
Card holders? Like NRA members? Eli5 plz
---
never said it was, nice try tho
---
I have been away for a bit, I remember being in fights where one Falcon could jam anything except caps and not only that but jam multiple ships at a time effectively making them useless.
---
Oh for sure. I was dead as soon as I ran out of cap boosters. I should have fit HAW's lol but I do it know if that would make a difference since all the ishtars were tracking disturbing me lawl 
---
So EVE has fallen into a cold war, a era of SuperCapital Deterrence. Conflicts will come and go by proxy, information on the enemy becoming the greatest weapon. A thousand ships built, sent and lost in a day, all without a single escalation of events. A era of peace brought about by the inability to strike first without risking dire loss. Calmness...by force.
---
It sounds far more interesting than it actually is....so same as usual for EVE if nothing else.
---
F, maybe it will stay dead this time....
---
Gawd. Where’s my popcorn?
---
Wtf am I reading
---
But they do stop a lot of its income if you and yours arent connected 24/7, its basically the main difference between today's active farming and the old passive moongoo. Any organisation that has enough players to have a good standing fleet 24/7 and enough people to have people farming all day long will outdo one that only does it for a few hours, while before you and yours didnt have to be logged in constantly to make similar ammounts.
---
Of course you can do that if you only log into the trading account at the beginning/end of your play session so you aren't multiboxing it. Otherwise yeah you'll have to sub the account.
---
so then how do you know you're having more fun
---
Yikes.
---
Guess I missed the part where I said you couldn't 
---
Not really. Sensible delegation and selective recruitment should shore you up. 
---
Buen traductor hijo de la grandisima puta XD
---
Not the rendition of BL Elo envisioned...
---
Funny as hell though, because its exactly the BL we expected...again
---
Calmatt is/was a TRI guy (SASH isnt in TRI anymore). He's a compulsive liar and has a lot of unwarranted self-importance.
---
I now make it a point to upvote all of his posts so everyone can see retardation in the flesh.
---
Ironic coming from you
---
We arent closing my man but we have voted as an alliance against high tidi fights therefore we arent as big as player maybe in the political field but we are effective and have tons of fun
---
Everyone needs to have a scanning ship. We also recommend bringing a venture (for gas sites), something you can do sleeper sites with (myrm or gila for c1-3), and if you want to get into PVP, you are going to want a covops hunting ship (T3C or Stratios) on your training plan.
---
There are other ships that are useful (e.g. interdictors, HICs, command destroyers, T3Ds) but the group you're playing with will tell you what they make the most use of beyond the basics.
---
Watching super cap battles on twitch to see if your still alive while people comment on the chaos is better than not knowing your fate after dc and waiting to log back in for 40 mins.
---
Amirite?
---
Oh, okay, in regards to the standing fleet. That makes more sense, I get that. With that, you can just say "hey we only have enough dudes to have a standing fleet between X and Y time" and accomplish mostly the same thing, I'd think. It's a good point, though.
---
 I suggest you create your own subreddit called [/r/S](https://www.reddit.com/r/JaredDaleBlogging)wordlessBunnyBlogging and post updates there.

Urgh, that makes it a Lukewarm War then. Just get to fucking each other (up with power plays and firepower out the wazoo) already!
---
So what you're saying is that we need a game where you think about playing Eve?
---
imagine ever trusting svet lmfao
---
What is imbalanced about the rorq is not the tank, but their insane yield. This was left out of hand and this time the game will die if they do not nerf those supers printing machines every monkey can inject to.
---
They're *really* good at it, though!
---
 I’ll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.

---
TRI calling out other people for claiming credit rofl.
---
The process you described, that's called fail cascading lol. That's what happens to shitty alliances, who has always been shit, who somehow convinced themselves they were worth anything while being backed up by NCPL against FCON, who still somehow lost that war, and who when confronted by any real enemies of their own size folded immediately.
---
&gt; ⁠Have a program that can track the mouse movement of all accounts
---
Yeah... that is not how the eve bots work. Which is the real problem.
---
No we'd lose and it wouldn't be fun.
---
Ive been on some of Elo's fleets, and Ive been in White Legion. Elo needs directors who can help him run the alliance, he needs FC's who can run his doctrines, and he needs pilots with decent sp and at least 2 braincells. While there is a bottomless pool of f1 monkeys he can use, there are limits on the number of corps, directors,  and FC's who might want to work with him. The allure of being in a BL reboot has to be weighed against the inevitable conclusion of dealing with the fallout, loss of assets, and lack of payment. Most directors and corps dont want to deal with that unless they are confident that they will get to loot the corpse and run. 
---
I dont really know, and wish I knew the answer. I think off the top of my head I would like ratting and mining to be in some way more engaging/entertaining for the people who like to do them and having more alternatives for the organisations who dont like to do them or dont have the numbers to have enough protection to properly do it in the scale it needs to be done.
---
You’re either flair baiting or a future ASCEE purged post.
---
I used to do this when I was a noob, its great for level 4s. But you learn v.quickly not to do it.
---
Nah, the tripple injector is to counteract the bomber meta used to down most rorquals, mostly through the use of focused void bombs. It can tank around 100-150 no problem, north of that is scary though. 200 is a bit much, even for the mighty rorqual ^^.
---
But yes, I would agree the yields and relative ease of entry is a point of concern when looking at the longevity of this games economy.
---
"unprofessional" is the thing people reach for when they want to argue but have no real meat in their beef
---
Falcon's *actual profession* is community management. You complained that all the dumb reddit sheep upvoted him too much. That sounds to me like the majority of the community liked what he had to say, job well done. It was a stupid situation from the beginning. Treating it, and the people who think 1488 gas the jews is a funny joke, with public contempt was in fact a great move. Plus a light temp ban to walk the line between being called out by media and soothing players by not being too draconian.
---
If some salty fucks who like to dish it out but can't take heat in return didn't like it, too bad.
---
Live fast and leave large corpse collection in some shithole lowsec station.
---
Thank you Ralph, very cool!
---
you wormholer

Hey come on we have done nothing :(
---
For so many years, there WONT be naything similar to EVE.
---
I would risk to say, that will take MANY, MANY years to the first decent one show himself.
---
I'd pay 10b for a killmail like that.... Wait :thonk:
---
Wait, BL is in Delve?
---
I had no idea.
---
In every demo they did before this retarded indy change, Falcon was saying the rorq needs to be taken to the grid and rewarded.   
---
But not that much rewarded, idiot, so that half of the players in space are sitting in rorquals. Back in the day building supers was a join venture or required a swarm of alts in hulks and one boosting rorq.
---
(Wormholers right now)[https://youtu.be/PdmE-Ga0f5s?t=86]
---
Yes, it's CCPs fault that you put your trust in the wrong people. 
---
XD yea, kinda one of those oshit moments.. chose the wrong drop huh ^^ any progress on getting reimbursement? I read above that they denied but u have the evidence to prove that the socket shut on ya
---
&gt;so then how do you know you're having more fun
---
i'm sure you can answer that question yourself
---
it's really not hard to tell when people are and aren't having fun unless you're a sociopath
---
POS at least you had a chance of the timer in a different TZ because of stront. Honestly they should bring stront back for citadels. 
---
How did you think the dronelands got populated?
---
Personally i think it's not worth having a second account until you get into capitals on the first. At that point you need the second account for the cyno alt and you have the ability to support it with the first account (carrier ratting/lvl 5s/etc). Of course you can carve out an advantage with a second ship in some situations, like wormhole farming or mining.
---
What in the actual fuck is that abomination!
---
Nicely done F
---
Assuming you aren't some troll:
---
What you're seeing is called the survival bias in statistics. Imagine for your entire life you live in a 5 story building with no elevators. For your entire life, you think, "All humans have 2 legs". One day you're let outside on the ground level, and you realize there are humans without legs, and even a few with one leg. This is the survival bias. Survival bias is all about recognizing there is a "filter" process before the data used in your conclusion is collected. 
---
There is a filter before people even start playing Eve that essentially works as a socio-economic barrier that prevents classes of people from playing Eve. The reality is you need 2-3 free hours a day, maybe more. On top of this, you need to be able to purchase the equipment to play video games on a PC. Most people of color don't have the means to buy the equipment to play video game. On top of that, if you're poor you likely work in labor jobs where a few hours of free time means the difference between having a enough for food at the end of the month, so they optimize for working longer hours and not taking leisure time. Both of these conditions lead to not playing Eve. 
---
In the same vein, I'm sure you haven't seen people who are mothers or fathers of newborns. Also you likely haven't seen blind people playing. Blacks aren't the only missing demographic in the game.
---
Source: I'm Black and I grew up in what I would call a Black American lifestyle. We're in Eve, but in super low numbers.
---
quitter
---
We are all doing well ty comrade. 
---
wtf that’s toxic as h*ck
---
The term krabs replaced carebears. It's been going on for years. People like to pretend that it's something relatively new, but it isn't. Some players enjoy pvp content and dislike a mentality that is focused on making that isk figure go up. Over the years it has gone out of favor with a good portion of the playerbase.
---
A correlation can be made with the term pubbie, which use to mean people that you could find in public matches in other games, was then used by goons to describe nearly everyone else in eve, but over the years with their continued rise in membership within their corp, alliance and coalition could very well be used against them.
---
is really suck to be subbed  right now...eve is not fun anymore
---
Leader AFK for holiday season. Alliance implodes. Apparently real life shouldn't come first.
---
Why is anyone surprised by this. Of you didn't have a contingency plan in place you are the only one to blame
---
This is EVEs second cold war tbh.
---
except this is an internet video game and you're talking in aggregate, so you can't actually observe any of the things that would tell you that
---
unless you stop and ask "on a scale from 1 to sex how much fun are you having", which is stupid (and assumes they aren't lying)
---
yeah and I’m sure u also think they play one day a week
---
Fuck man I was going to shit post and now I just feel bad...feels bad man.

If there is anyway I want to give the OP a little hug. No shit I actually feel bad for BL members

He flys dreads into hostile citadels. What could go wrong?

Bosons are the biggest issue right now. They are pretty big hit on roams.
---
Really? One of our guys have killed a couple hundred bil in the past few months. Which narrative is it this time, "thanks for killing our shit so I can make money selling it back to the victims" or "we didn't even notice you killed our shit?" Or maybe it's some general sperg about a delve time unit?

I guess what I'm saying is our objective is to have fun blowing shit up whenever we can, not disrupt your bearing and bash your structures. I don't care if you've noticed, and neither does anyone else.
---
I tried to join darwinism once while I was actively living in Khalid. You guys said no.
---
 interesting tid bit. I'll keep that in mind. I should have realized a Disconnect was coming when the mod I was pressing wasn't responding. I thought it was stuck or bugged which is why I moved it 
---
Is it a weird version of “didn’t need it any way. Already replaced” post?
---
Jokes have a comical content to them, but im sure you'll be able to enlighten me on the comical content of said joke with your self proclaimed wisdom.
---
I wish you luck in keeping that promise. My last two alliances weren't able to. No disrespect to the leaders of those alliances, but I don't think it's a promise that *can* be kept in EVE any more. The true story of medium-big alliances right now is that you either get dragged into high TiDi situations or you die from lack of content.
---
So wait, moving your module actually had something todo with the DC or? I guess I didn't think altering your own UI in a superficial way didn't generate anything on the server end? 
---
When you log in and your entire corp.is rorqual.mining Everytime and it's a "pvp" Corp is why
---
Most importantly fuck CCP for all the turbocrab shit. Like seriously. Remember when reading about a Titan or a super dunk was cool? Or when a corp theft in the billions was cool? Now you just look at them all and it’s just... meh, whatever. Nothing of value was lost. Everything in Eve is pretty safe. 
---
And they still haven't fixed that damn "your module is cycling but it's not" bug huh, only reason I can imagine you moved it and then back

Go back to mining.

It comes from the legacy of EVE when hisec was over-run with carebears in Deadspace permatank CNR’s doing L4 missions or just sitting in belts all day mining Veldspar because they were totally risk adverse. Any time pvp’rs interfered with their krabbing with can baiting or ganks they screamed at CCP to protect them and turn hisec into a risk free theme park. It was an utterly tedious activity where the only goal was to buy even more bling modules to run Angels Extravaganza .45 seconds faster. They contributed nothing really to the social aspect of being a MMO other than providing loot piñatas for low sec pirates to come and gank. Ratting is a generally hated activity by most pvp’rs because of the mechanism where you had to ‘rat back’ your sec status between ganks - there weren’t any complexes so you spent all your time in Lowsec belts. When tags became a thing carebears screamed that it was basically giving punishment free mechanisms to gankers so there has been a long standing feud between PvP’rs and carebears as the latter want zero risk isk making themeparks and the former want isk to require risk. Now in terms of null krabbing nobody really hates krabbets beyond hazing who are turbokrabbing to buy a super/Titan/whatever, but there is disdain for the carebears who don’t ever X up for stratops or paps and simply use the alliance as a shield for personal enrinchment. These guys are always the one who lose their shot from never being in standing, comms etc but pisswhine when they get their shit pushed in by a drop they could have been saved from if they had any PvP skills whatsoever.     
---
TLDR: the rewards in null and low used to be really shitty and hisec was overrun with carebears making dank isk with virtually no risk. A long fought battle was waged between players over it and there is still a lot of resentment from both sides that CCP was giving them favourable treatment in game balancing issues. Pvp’rs have always been poorer than carebears for obvious reasons and the whole selling point of Eve for a lot of people was space piracy which carebears didn’t want, so its been a PvP/PVE battle of ideology that still lingers.

Our only hope is that SC will eventually get there seeing as its aiming to be an MMO. ED isn't really aiming that way.

I'm going to London for this one.
---
I know plenty.of people of various back rounds that play eve . No one declares "hey I'm (insert ethnicity) " why would anyone need to? 
---
most of the ppl krabbing in vni /minning rorqs/ratting supers/smart bomb machs  are either bots or rmt cunts...nullsec was deprived of old content aka small gang pewpew...small gang used to go for bears catch 1  and  pewpew was ensuing....now they just light a cyno or, before u can catch some1, are thetered on citadel...shit mecanics/plenty of botting+=shit game
---
I can't officially confirm anything, but I do know in the last 3 fights where local was 300+ moving any of my modules around caused a socket close for the client. 
---
First reinforcement cycles last for between 22 and 50 hours
---
When a structure enters its final reinforcement period it looks for the next reinforcement time on the weekly reinforcement day that occurs at least X days in the future, and then randomly adds or subtracts some amount time up to two hours in either direction. This X value depends on the location of the structure:
---
0.5 days for Wormhole space
---
2.5 days for Lowsec and Nullsec space
---
5.5 days for Highsec space
---
This means that the final battle for a structure will always take place on the day of the week chosen by the defender, within a four hour window centered on their selected reinforcement hour.
---
Under this new system a random unscouted attack against a full power Upwell structure could lead to a set of reinforcement timers with a maximum combined duration of 14 days in highsec, 11 days in nullsec and lowsec, and 9 days in W-space.
---
so imagine spending 11 days per citadel to kill each.
---
and once u do, because raitaru and astras are so cheap vs rorq mining.  they just drop 3 more.
---
this is why the neut astra in bwf is still untouched. nobody cares about killing it cause whenever we do its just replaced without any problem.  shit all we can do to stop it either as again, its SO CHEAP.
---
No real narrative, I was just generally unaware BL was in Delve as I haven't logged in in a couple months.
---
Thanks for the insecure sperg about how much you didn't care though.
---
You corrected someone's spelling and said "My Dude" Get fucked in the lowest realms of pubie hell.
---
Yeah, if it's not responding, I don't recommend trying to move it.   
---
Worth testing but I surely quit doing it. 
---
Such a good Courtney Love quote!
---
Huh, I was wondering what those random invuln timers were when flying around.
---
Wowie, that isn't an official confirmation but idk what else it can mean. Have any others who do big fleet fights recall that happening as well? 
---
Does moving my module(s) around show up on outgoing calls(I swear I read somewhere it's all related to that)? 
---
None as of yet. CCP denied it about an hour after I submitted the ticket. I replied to the GM to state my case but it looks like CCP has a pretty firm stance on this.  
---

&gt;There is literally no way to balance around number of pilots each side can field.

Stacking penalties would work.
---
You've been in Delve for a MONTH!!!? Is that why Elo was in Sakht when I was fueling a tower? 
---
Damn your presence was not very remarkable. 
---
He was afk for most of December, not to mention several failed campaigns. This has been a long time coming, brother.
---
So you made sure to comment that you didn't know we were in delve because you haven't logged in in a couple months? Thanks for the valuable contribution, please tell us more things you don't know because you haven't been playing. 
---
If you need to have an alt to have fun, then you're in the wrong corp fwiw
---
Indeed, didn't even think about drugs or implants. 
---
They generate PvP? Whelping on the daily isn't much PvP.
---
We have done well on it so far and hope to continue doing so hope more entities that light fighting emerge or else big wars will kill the game for everyone
---
So?
---
&gt;Hey, when your social group vilifies a particular activity to the point of moustache-twirling comedy
---
Probably the best thing I have ever read.
---
Beautiful sentence!
---
Small? Sure. Angry? Not really lol. More amused than that anyone cares about BL... than amything epse.
---
More of a "and nothing of value was lost" actually
---
Literally this, RnK called it. I didn't want to believe it for a long time but when you look over the the events of  how Serentity developed and evolved it was just the same but on a shorter time scale because of more rampant botting. 
---
As a very vocal opponent of BL, I still think you folks that enjoyed being in comms and playing together should pick a few new leaders and FCs and keep on having fun. If that means dropping back and re-grouping, so be it. The problem is, you guys really personified yourself on reddit as ultra elite turbo badasses and that doesn't mesh well it needing to step back and sort yourself out. I'd give the vote of support to eat humble pie and stick with people you like.

I've got 3 pilots training into Carriers and FAX machines. I've got better armor skills so I'm training into the Apostle first, then I'll go Gal for carrier, Then Mino because I need to finish off my EM/Kin/Therm/Exp Compensation skills to V.

Good bot.

ill say about insu when i played with them years ago. they are shit and you shouldnt expect much from them
---
There are plenty of goons who have been solidly on the supers are killing the game side for many years now, regardless if we were winning or losing the supercap wars. GSF has been solidly in favor of new players with cheap ships since the beginning.

Do you see the difference between french/spanish and english ? It's call "different origin" I suggest you to get some culture to understand the concept of "different culture" because no, it's not "just retard cannibalism"

Why did the other one tank so much less with the same relative fit? Different implants or no blue pill or did they volley through the shields?
---
Its a great mechanic for cleaning up the citadel clutter.
---
But they dont finish it
