Oh, for sure, this is true for all factions. The new Rupture could be Caldari, if not for the paint scheme. The Minny designs of old were a mess of antennae, trusses, protrusions of all sorts. The OG Stabber/Vaga hull looked insane, and I loved it.

---
Well you need to be blind on both eyes to fit your Titan like this.
---

---
The killmail above goes way beyond having tanked up the wrong fuel or other kinds of fuckups.
---
Killmails like these are the reason we get so many dudes chilling in our space waiting to drop on some retard who fucks up.
---
If you join into Goons or the Imperium or one of its affiliates in gerneral you get bombarded with guides on how to fit yout ship, what to carry in your cargo, where to go for alternatives if you're to poor (fuck off you're flying a Titan) and in case we can import from Jita too.
---
Goons have a massive backbone in Industrial shit, if you desperately need something you can sure as fuck get it in Delve. I'm Certain!
---
Its pretty hard to shitfit something, especially since CCP actually did a good job with their simulation tool! Everything is crosslinked and you can doublecheck soooo easily.
---
That pilot was just obtuse and should be forced to take part in the most "how to basic class 101" there is.
---
People without clue that wanted to have a titan really bad before injectors, would just buy the character from bazaar.
---
Both ability to get enough isk and ability to find a seller without getting scammed or hunted down one mid out were the limiting factor here. Arguably ability to just contract/market sell titans (read: Keepstars) did the most harm here.
---
i dont know if the its still the same or if its changed i do know back when i cared sigs spawned at a set amount for a region and you had to run the sigs to make more spawn but they spawned in other systems i would guess this is the case
---
Okey so you want more risk, thats the thing right?
---
Can I ask you what the actual risk for the hunter is? Cause the way I see it, there really isnt any on that side either. Cause they can also be cloaky nullified as well right? And a good hunter needs less than 1 minute to scan you down.
---
I honestly dont really care either way but I do understand the issues of removing gates (like it would crash the entire thing cause your bookmark wont mean shit) and such will create issues. Can there be a better way? Probably ye. Will it be in the hunters favor? I dont believe hunters should have more advantages. 
---
But is this change relevant? Like dont we have a long list of things that would actually be better to change first?
---
It's pretty crazy to think that sometimes individuals aren't exactly the same as your perspective of their entire group huh! Welcome to teenage level comprehension of social situations.
---
You can't enforce it. You probably can't event convince 5% of super pilots to not log in and drop on things. They have em and wanna use em. 
---
I'm small gang wormhole with enough content to make me happy. I also frequents this sub and am trying to get into the Talking in Station podcast. I just get irked when the commentators there often complain about not having wars and content when they created their own problem. They lobby through CSM to get CCP to "Fix the game" when the mechanics are the least of the problem. Player mentality is the problem. 
---
In short you are right: Stop asking CCP to fix your lack of content, make your own.
---
From a SC guy, I’m sorry for your loss Eve community.
---
o7
---
Good old Jackdaw John
---
Pretty much. When none of them wanted to give up asset safety for the 'good of the game,' then clearly they aren't interested in changes that truly help said game for everyone.
---
/u/Vily_R This is all your fault.
---
But that's just it, CCP can't fix it. Any change they make will impact null in the same manner as blackout. All the things you listed will create a mass exodus.
---
We/they can't count on CCP to fix our lack of content if we aren't trying to make our own. Making friends with everyone is a type of content sure, and if that is your priority fine. Unfortunately, you can't have your friends and pod them too.
---
He's not a goon because I have him tagged in my RES as "Grr Gon Elite PvP Hostile Douchebag" so clearly he's a repeat badposter.
---
There's a 99.999% chance he's a V0lta shitler given his posting history.
---
also always carry a backup probes stack
---
best is you dont have to reload
---
Yeah, there's no possible way for people to communicate and coordinate over the Internet except through Eve.  That's why we didn't have anything like alliances until CCP added alliances to the game.  And why coalitions, which have no in-game tools to support them, don't exist.
---
Oh wait....
---
&gt;There is actually a way to deal with this, or at least mitigate it, it's by deleting asset safety. Your Keepstar is going to die with 250 Titans in it ? Who cares lol asset safety will send it to the closest LS station where you can just have it back. That's the problem.
---
Yeah, it's too bad Titans don't have any way to travel on their own and are permanently locked inside Keepstars.
---
The true sons and daughters of New Eden will HTFU or GTFO.
---
I'm starting to think you created a new account and made this entire thread lol. You been like the only on replying and engaging. Like no one cares about what ya think. But thank for the publicity. You are a Chismosa.
---
At this rate CCP will be better off doing nothing, since broken systems generate more news than working ones.
---
The best way to learn about wormhole space is to just go live in wormhole space.
---
You can't, issue with DPS or tank.  
---
Triple Nestors on the other hand... Add armour links and you might not think of it.
---
I'm not going through the effort of finding a corp and moving assets out there without researching it first.  It makes no sense to do something like that when you can just ask a few questions first to make sure it's something you'll enjoy rather than hate.
---
Drone agro is certainly a consideration, but it will be a tanking issue in highclass holes (C5-C6). Whilst its feasible in lower class holes, many other faster, cheaper, and easier options exist, rattlesnake comes immediately to mind, but there are others.
---
High class ratting revolves around nestor/leshak balls, or rattlesnakes at the subcap level. Or single or multiple dread ratting for capitals. Many many many videos are available on youtube to explain all of these.
---
Understood.  I'll dig into some more of those shortly.  Thanks for answering my questions.
---
Is your vision killing this game?
---
Lack of demand. You log on at peak US west coast time and there's 13k people on now.
---
im not gonna watch a 2 hour video
---
I miss EVE Classic.
---
Its absolutely necessary they remove asset safety in it’s entirety from M and L citadels, maybe even XLs, in Null.
---
It’s also going to doom the game if they do that. SCap proliferation has become so unbalanced that the second it’s implemented the major blocs will farm the shit out of everything that moves, and turn everything outside of their space into either (even more) empty, glassed regions, or pet groups they occasionally farm.
---
CCP has chosen a type of player, and interlocked EVE’s systems around that type. Breaking those systems means rejecting the whales that currently prop up what’s left of the game in any real financial sense. They’ve driven off the majority of people outside that player type, and nothing beyond extreme changes - which will crater the PCU before they regain the trust and interest of bittervet/non-whale players - will ever restore that balance.
---
I mean fundamentally how do you solve content generation when you’ve advertised and promised a game with 10k plus player fights where *you make a difference* while simultaneously having
---
-	Citadels that have absurdly long timers, 99% of which hold literally no value beyond their salvage, and in some cases removed structures or mechanics that actually generated value and content
---
-	SP on demand, isk generation now becoming the primary form of progression coupled with some of the worst, most repetitive, unengaging PVE in any game
---
-	The two sources of hyper scalable isk generation being skill farming - no chance of running out of injectors! - and Rorquals, cratering the mineral market. Consequently this turns any PVE that isn’t hyper safe and repetitive, or hyper profitable, into a literal waste of time
---
All of these factors have culminated in a huge accrual of SCaps and SCap pilots across the board while providing no outlet for them to ever be destroyed in any significant quantities. 
---
At this point CCP would have to significantly nerf or rework all three factors and simultaneously delete/refund SCaps for the game to ever return to a healthy state. It’ll never happen otherwise in it’s current configuration and even that’s questionable with the current subcap meta.
---
As a returning bittervet of 2004 vintage, let me say that this is spoken like a true "random power-tripping null player who's been at supposedly-end-game-content position for too long".
---
There's a bunch of you guys that sound more and more like SirMolle of old every day (goons still surpass you in this regard, so you at least have something to strive for, now that nothing of value is left to pursue in game due to the blue doughnut).
---
At this point in time, the main difference between them and current coalitions during their respective prime times is that they were crap at logistics and industry (compared to what null blocs do today), but much better in PvP, so we at least have some variety in the flavor of arrogance being dick-waved around the galaxy over the years.
---
Let that sink in if you please, you guys have become what you were complaining was "killing the game" in the first place.
---
But his therapy doesnt keep me entertained on reddit
---
Single Shard MMO, we are all in this together till we win EVE, one way or another.

I'm not sure what this is even supposed to mean.

The only thing surprising here is that Vily can talk with Mattani's yam bag hitting him in the chin.

---
Do you know the "[Magic 14?](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)"
---
Points spent on these are never wasted, at least on a character that will be out flying ships.
---
It's a podcast. This starts on a stream, goes to youtube, then an edited version is put out I believe. It is all part of Talking in Stations network
---
The need to add a diminishing return on sov controlled by a single alliance. Like make the more systems you control, makes the adms for all system you control drop faster. So you have to pick an choose. You can control a lot of system but you need exponentially more people. Then what you end up with is more alliances closer to each other. Possibly not friendly. They cant evict each other and take the sov, because it would only weaken them. So they will live and fight. 
---
Or we can have another eve gate event and destroy everyone's clone technology and go back to earth space. To a new universe.
---
You listening to Takeshi 6ix9ine  says a lot about you lol. Playing the role of a gangster, but you really just a rat.
---
Only 5 individual people could be at ar with 5 individual people would fix that
---
The point is rather that the moderators often enough delete battlereport posts of people who were there and keep random link only posts.
---
&gt; I just get irked when the commentators there often complain about not having wars and content when they created their own problem. They lobby through CSM to get CCP to "Fix the game" when the mechanics are the least of the problem. Player mentality is the problem. 
---
On Serenity PIBC eventually invaded the wormholes too. Here on Tranquility we've already seen a Goon alliance do a major incursion to evict HK, and the biggest coalitions have also extended their influence into high sec and into faction warfare.
---
Point being, unless CCP intervenes to disincentivize mega coalitions it's just a matter of time before your tiny little haven is just as bad as nullsec.
---
So that's a yes, then.
---
Too bad they also don't have weapons systems with which to defend the Keepstar they're permanently locked inside
---
I was convinced you will ask them to actually draw for you and the most talented one wins you for his corp...
---
Whatever you understood I think you missed it.
---
I wanted to know whats the default action the Q key is doing since i have mods on these rows
---
&gt; He's part of the grr wormholes are super difficult and elite mentality which is hilarious given his corp.
---
Me? No i'm not. I think it's easy, it's certainly much easier than it was presented to me when i was living in null. That's why i think that if you are interested in it you should grab a ship and take the plunge. 
---
Tbh grabbing a Astero, Stratios or T3C and backpacking out of it for a while or even just daytripping with a cheap battleship. adventuring through the chain before you understand how it comes together is an amazing experience.
---
OP was famous for ninjaing sotyos cans everytimes using a lootscript and rmting the isks. Not much to say.
---
Smth had to be done i guess
---
lol @ how well informed you are on the topic while making claims about it
---
They are not war eligible.
---
No, he dropped some dreads to ensure the sotiyo dies on their time table. Fed those dreads to titans, then warped in a freighter but failed to loot it.
---
None of that covers living in wspace or is even indicative of what it's like. One is just scanning and maybe hacking, the other is like blind pve
---
It was meant to be PVE content that was to lead to PVP.          
---
PvEvP
---
&gt; its mind bogling that nobody has picked up on the ways yo counter all of this
---
I fully agree with you but it was still a shit mechanic.
---
That's not a bad call I guess
---
Hi ! 
---
It is possible to solo c5/c6 with one toon but only in a dread ! 
---
As others have pointed out most of the c6’s if not all are owned by larger WH alliances. C5’s are sometimes vacant and you could find yourself one by scanning. 
---
As you have one toon my advice would be to live out of a medium pos unless you have the isk to invest in a fortizar. You will have to consider the times when you need to rat / probe / haul and so your one toon will need a place to leave his ships. A fortizar and fit will be around 12-14b whereas a poss setup could be done for a few hundred mill. 
---
If you go the c5 route there is also the option of being a hobo! You anchor your pos farm the sites and then wait for another incoming c5 and move into that one. Rinse and repeat.
---
A solo dread will need to refit in sites to clear them - at all times you will be sieged and so vulnerable to being caught. Try and lower the odds of dying by farming at off peak times.
---
Your biggest concern should you be caught is the fact you don’t have a toon able to scan your way back in. I would suggest pausing training on your main and spending a week training very basic skills on another character slot so that he can probe your way back in should you die. Else all will be lost! 
---
There is also the option of living out of a shattered wormhole in your dread - these will give you access to c6 sites but I would run some on sisi to get the feel of it before committing. Once you are full you would need to head out into lowsec and drop off your loots.
---
Good luck in your wormhole adventures I look forward to catching you 😵
---
&gt; Nullsec? just anchor bubbles
---
just fucking stop posting.
---
Two of mine gave me 100M 2 nights ago,   each,  as a joke for me saying I was broke. 
---
48m is as absolute laugh.  That's not even pocket change...
---
Oh so he wants to skip the fun stuff and get straight to the dull day to day stuff?
---
&gt; You changed what I quoted. Not a nice thing to do. It's not clear if you were referring to jump drive or jump through hole.
---
Sorry, I thought I was providing more context.  I meant through wormholes, as with gating capitals around, not jump drives.
---
&gt; Why must you prevent arbitrary number of ships?
---
One of the things that makes wormholes a haven for smaller corporations is that, if you bring more people, you need to bring smaller ships.  It's a counterbalance to the classic n+1 problem that is actually much stronger than single ship size restrictions in wormholes.
---
No, right click on the start button and click "System", tell us your processor.
---
Then in that window hit "device manager", then expand "display adapters" and tell us what is listed there.
---
If your GPU is named something like "intel HD XXXX" then you may be effected by a bug and will have to wait till CPP resolves the issue.
---
Ah yes, like the time the ECM mechanics got changed and CCP spent thousands of man-hours carefully considering and adjusting every module and ship affected.
---
No wait, ECM died at 11:00 that patch day.
---
Probably should also make it so they can't be cheesed with supers/titans
---
They do undock and fight, but not the kind of fight that you are looking for. An overwhelming show of force to scare off any attackers. That's because it's the best way to maximize effectiveness, maximizing destruction and minimizing losses. 
---
Asking people to play suboptimally to have fun won't ever work in a PVP environment. Because the person playing for fun will always get trampled by the person playing the optimal meta. And getting trampled endlessly isn't fun (this is why smaller groups are dying out.)
---
You can live a life as a trader or producer without undocking ever. However, you need some money to start with, so you need some pve in the beginning.
---
even if you only cashed out basic implant from nullsec pirat lp store, the amount of LP/isk generated is way more important than the l4 misions.
---
There is a few things to know about living in High Class wormholes, especially c6. I know some of the basics have already been mentioned here so apologise for repeating information.
---
First of all I hope you have more then one character, or friends who can join you. At the very bare minimum you will need scanning alts in the hole so that you can always find your way back in again. Running c6 sites (and c5 sites) also cannot be done solo unless using a Dread (some c5 sites can be run with a Maurader). I saw a brief mention of ratting with carriers and supers... nobody uses those in wormhole space unless it's a "rolling" carrier. The meta for ratting in caps is to run 3 dreads in a site working together (which is why I asked if you had more then one account or friends). Other ways people rat in High Class space is with Nestors, Leshaks, Rattlesnakes - but you'll need a few.
---
The biggest issues you will have is finding a vacant c6 and you'll have an even harder time holding onto it if you are not affiliated with a corp or alliance that will defend your farm hole. There is no way you can hold onto a c6 solo - you need friends.
---
The best way to go about getting yourself a c6 farm hole is to be part of one of the larger wormhole pvp corps (once you get to know people and the community you'll quickly hear if and when a hole is for sale or if you find an eviction target to take over a hole you'll need help doing it). Someone in the corp may also already have a c6 farm hole and will be willing to let you use it. However bare in mind most of these corps have requirements and if your sole interest in wormhole space is just to be a turbo krab I can't see any half decent wormhole corp wanting you regardless of how much SP your account has. Also many require you to have your main live with them in their main hole and they put dread alts in their farm holes. If you are not living in the wormhole where the corp opperates it's highly unlikely they will want you for that reason also. 
---
Other issues you may encounter is people seeding your hole, this is going to happen and there is no way to avoid it. You will also have content from the wormholers that live in high class space with you. Rage rolling is going to be something to watch out for - new sigs should never be ignored. Rolling can be dangerous if you don't scout (you might have cloaky eyes sat watching you). If you use a carrier to roll then you need to be careful and watch out for pre-massed holes as well if it's not a fresh hole. 
---
Alternatively there are a couple of corps that live in c6 space (Dead Star Syndicate is the only one I know of off the top of my head). However it's unlikely they will let you rat in their home system for your wallet which means you'll have to use a connection or a static to rat in. You then will have issues with mass (you can only take 1 dread through not 3 so it's not as effective at all). You will also have the problem of if the corp wants to roll for content you'll have to stop what you are doing and head back - one corp sharing one static will mean content takes priority.
---
**TLDR; You will need friends, several alt's and you will have a hard time if you are not part of a large wormhole corp that can help you acquire and defend the bear hole. These large wormhole corps are not likely going to want you unless your main lives in their wormhole and your priority is PVP not krabbing. What you want to do is generally what people do on dread alts - they do not live in that hole on their mains.**
---
&gt; then move, there is space in the game where caps hardly get used or cant get used so why not move
---
I did. But i'm also not an empire builder and would rather just hang out with a group of close friends doing whatever.
---
Boooooooooooo. But Stain Man, ORE stands for "Obliterate &amp; Reprocess Everyone"
---
He is talking about time investment to build/buy ships and fits. I can see where he is coming from. CCP has been cutting back on isk income while trying to encourage pvp. Them doing so has caused people to deem it not worth the hassle. Pvpers don't have fun in the end due to reduced player count.
---
According to the link the text exceeds the size limit
---
you can never solo with two ... that would be a duet.
---
Getting them all to V can be a bit of a slog for a new player. Understand what they do, and prioritize. If you're flying mostly armor for example, Shield Management V might come well after getting your favorite guns to T2.
---
All this would do is make it impossible for groups that are not goons to live. Like if this would exist goons would form a dog that cycles around the entirety of the map and farms every structure
---
Im a Minmatar and would like to run something like a gun boat with some backup missiles. I’ve been doing research and it looks like Calderi are who I want but I LIKE the look and lore of the Mitar people so I’m gonna stay with them
---
&gt; NPC nullsec is pretty bad place at the moment.
---
Can confirm. Syndicate is dead. Source: I live in Syndicate.
---
Shame the whole thing is a complete sham and has done nothing but make the warzone even more dead than it was before. Simply because people wanted to fill their own pockets.
---
They could also spawn few times more than now, but with the maintaining overall drop rate for capital BPC, but they could drop battleship BPC always.
---
you cant cheese them with supers anymore, the rats will spawn and shoot the fighters.
---
We need a total PvE revamp, and a strategic sovwar revamp that removes supers &amp; titans from their current "titans are the only ship that matters" balance situation. (Actually the fax changes are a good step on titans, we just haven't seen it pan out in a major war yet.)
---
Null power is about titans, titans are about rorqs, and rorqs are about not having neuts within 30 gates of you b/c it makes it harder to afk40boxmine.
---
The PvE system is profoundly anti-pvp and anti-content. But you have to interact with the rorq PvE system to win alliance-level PvP (titan blob wars).
---
This is a case of perverse incentives: the way you win wars requires doing things to ensure you never, ever fight wars and have as little fun as possible in the game.
---
Remove the current mining system entirely and nuke the strategic power of titans (make em immune to fax reps so they always lose iskwars to dreads), so optimizing a no-content-allowed PvE setup is no longer the only way to power up your null alliance.
---
The video provides useful directions.
---
Ability to redistribute your entire skillpoints every year. Kill half the systems in the game. Add a "degradation" timer to Towers and its structures where folks can just yank it out without having to rf or even shoot it. Many more but these would be nice (i think).
---
- Remove injectors
---
- Supers can’t track subcaps
---
- You don’t show up in local until you break gate cloak
---
if dxdiag doesnt know what CPU you have then there is something odd going on with your system O\_o
---
Seems to be a dual-core which will not give you a great gaming experience (Recommended is a quad core with 3,6GHz)
---
Same goes for RAM. You have 4GB, recommended is 16GB. It will work but you might have issues depending how much RAM other applications are hogging up.
---
And your intel integrated graphics driver is over 2 years old. would suggest updating this.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Try running windows update and check if it finds updates for you (this should also find integrated graphics drives afaik)
---
All in all I'd say that depending on whatever CPU you have your PC might simply not be able to run games properly/at all
---
I would offer an option to hide the name of a player in his lossmail... at the cost of hiding it in his killmails too, and with an activation/deactivation delay of 1 week. People HATE lose, but would be more inclined to do so or to take risks if there weren't the shame effect provided by killboards. Only the player name, the rest will remain as it and the delay is here to avoid some risk-adverse pre-battle escape.
---
I would remove logistics ships. You want to be repaired on field ? Fit a repairer. Maybe this way we will see more variety in ship doctrines, maybe battleships will serve again.
---
I would raise up the cost of standard capital ships by 3x to make battleships more appealing, supers by 2x and titans by 2x. It should make them more harder to get, but at least it won't make them take rust in the hangar unlike the cynonerf (that I would remove after raising the price).
---
And I would also restore skill requirement of capital ships and some T2 modules like they were in 2010, so it would take more time to get them, and so making T1 market great again.
---
...and to avoid any workaround, skill injectors should be nerfed if not totally removed.
---
Don’t mine unless you enjoy that. Try a bit of everything, but spend your time and skills working on what you have fun doing. So maybe that’s mining, but when I started I only mined because I didn’t think I was good enough to do anything fun. That’s less true in eve than lots of games. You can be useful to a PvP fleet fairly quick.
---
Backing the argument of a person arguing that fighting against the UI is good game design is a shit hill to die on.
---
You should stick to flying frigates since your reddit posting has been shit lately.
---
This is sadly true for much of the t1 module market.
---
T2 is a different story, as it requires a decent skill requirement.
---
Remove all Capital Ships.
---
&gt; And finally, I'd implement crew 
---
Didn't Himar said something about making titans/supers more expensive to own ? What about having to pay the thousands of people operating a super...
---
Do you have one?
---
Or are you just here to white knight and epolice?
---
E: [JFC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/dg21lw/my_first_three_days_in_eve_online/f39lc4t/?context=3)
---
Right. Because fittings were a big secret before public killboard and the API.
---
Also, let's make spying a bannable offense.
---
Setting access to POSes via standings or passwords - a pain in the ass, but completely doable.
---
Setting access to Citadels via ACLs - much more convenient.
---
Rolling back to standings and passwords for citadels is a pain in the ass, but also entirely doable.
---
Your inability to evaluate your proposals and how the blocs would react doesn't change that nuance.
---
I would cram angry mustaches sweet fucking list down some icelandic throats and put the whole thing in game.
---
Then I'd find a way to make PVE not a snore fest, I'm open to sending electric shocks through the mouse to keep people awake but I'd like it to be more entertaining than just torturing a deserving player base.

People have failed to ascribe why passive income is good.

So have you.
---
I don' t mean to sound harsh, but I have been asking these types of questions for 4 years now, and the only answer I get is a vague 'it will give more fights'.
---
fucking remove the ability to run more than 1 instance of the client per machine. make it so that you cant do everything by yourself. make it so that youre playing a multiplayer game with actual people instead of just yourself and x amount of alts.
---
you wanna play 26 characters at once, fine. go buy 26 machines (yea yea yea, i know, virtualization, shut up, you'd still require multiple machines to run x amount of VMs). otherwise, join or create a corporation and participate in group activities.
---
T2 works the same except that in the end he answers "I have a T2 BPO for this."
---
exactly
---
1600 plates would have never made sense, titans and supers used to have way more raw HP than they do now, a 1600 plate would have done as much then as it does now (nothing)
---
Cracks forming?
---
In theory you can do what you intend there. In praxis you won't understand the market well enough if you never undock. Production itself has a rather low profit. It's usually only interesting in combination with market trading. Also many production chains have a strong vertical integration by now which makes it difficult for a new player to get into. So probably just do a bit of market trading plus other activities. If you gain more knowledge and capital you can go into production too.
---
It's not going to solve the supercap umbrella shit but it's a good idea nonetheless.
---
I found this video to be very helpfull for someone like me who hasn't done anything related to the invasion.
---
I do agree however with some other ppl that it would be better too either make shorter videos or at least make some bookmarks where you can skip to stuff you guys talk about.
---
Keep it up though :)

You can run pirate forward operating bases

That’s a good information!

Owning the sovereign space where the pirates spawn FOBs is attractive and a reason to conquer and control those constellations.
---
That's right. Amarr ships are the least newbie friendly because they require good capacitor skills to use effectively in addition to gunnery, tank, and drones skills. Gallente are most commonly used by newer players since you can still use their pretty well drone ships with just skills in drones and not much in everything else (which most other ships still need anyway).

As long as you cant see local while you have gate cloak as well.

You lose all credibility when you argue for a complete removal of asset safety. You act as if before citadels people would lose their assets but all that happened was they were stuck. There were options to either get isk or get your assets back. 
---
Ya in this hypothetical no one will quit, but a complete removal of asset safety means no one will return. Yes asset safety needs to change but outright removal is not the correct way to go about it. 
---
You have decent thoughts on the rest of the game but just casually throw in something that outright wont work.
---
Right on. I used to scour APIs for recruitment in the XML days but I've been out of touch for anything not relevant to just undocking and shooting for a couple years now.
---
You didn’t even look at them. Give me a reason for all of them being bad.
---
Yeah I built one, it's very sturdy makes pretty high res prints but needed a 32bit board
---
Edit: I have the dual z axis version
---
Rather be in goons than in the dumpster
---
It depends on what exactly they log
---
you do realize the video was edited and LITERALLY shows him using either a lootscript or some form of injection right?
---
Aww yeahhhh, 50 internet points for 25b ISK, bargain!
---
Bumping frigate looks indeed low probable...
---
But, If you are right, what is he getting by making this post?
---
r/eve
---
I don't touch APIs myself, but I use deliveries instead of contracts when I'm dumping industry stuff between characters. Contracts are good for when you're not in that station or between other people to keep a paper trail on the sender's end. I don't think deliveries are tracked from the side of person doing the delivery.
---
Huh, so it might not be RMT but someone transferring wealth between two characters without leaving logs that would show up in an API check. And since all you see in the API is someone selling a bunch of PLEX they can just say they're rich IRL and bought a buttload of PLEX.
---
I won't play in low or null, I'm a casual player. I just want to know how the Concord tax is applied
---
Botting != Multiboxing :)
---
Lol
---
Could u just stop shitting up r/eve, it’s bad enough already.
---
RMT moved out of jita because with jita being on it's own node it's easier to get caught.
---
I mean.. thanks for letting us know but youre 3 years late...
---
Those T1 frigs are also good for when you get a good lowsec hole, fyi.
---
Fastest looter in new eden amiright
---
So is there  a difference in sansha relics in period basis, delve and other regions that have them? Or are there no "subtypes".
---
And why would you sue it?
---
Sounds like a plan, I'll bring in some T1 frig hulls for my guys also, should we run in to each other...
---
Hell yeah it's awesome, I've been tempted to do a remake of it. My brother decompiled the game and sifted through the assembly code to find all kinds of interesting stuff.
---
You don't need to move PLEX at all though, you can activate it from anywhere.
---
So you are out what, a few mill?
---
Inquiring minds wish to know...
---
wtf is RMT ?
---
Capitals to stronk they say.. in reality 20 caps cant kill a single cruiser well balanced game.

Real Money Trade, basically people buying in-game ISK for cash. It's not allowed and can get you banned, so people use all kinds of weird ways to send the ISK that they think CCP can't trace. But they can totally trace it.
---
Reddit account selling ain't no joke sirs
---
You are so, so wrong. Try doing some small gang or watch old AT vids.
---
RMT = Real Money Trade
