Honestly that looked like one fun ass fight lol... those two supers were shit tho heh... ZERO fucking tank refit, NO nestor(s), and oh also... DON'T CRAB WHILE YOUR WHOLE ALLIANCE IS ON A FLEET LOL... guys are new to alliance, claim no one told them you cant be mining/crabing while big fleets are out (lawl), but ugh... we were like 10 mins away from getting back to fountain when we heard about this going on, had to burn back, clone out to Q and get set up... what a mess, and honestly perfect call to kill what u did and then get out going for the rag wouldn't have ended well.

CCP don't manage that bit of the server in china, unfortunately. That'd be netease (as far as I understand it)

thx darkness for dank kills

" J.space is not as safe as Null.sec " 
---
i dont agree with this there is danger in any space but if you know what to look out for you will be fine regardless if its ns or wh.
---
" Higher tier WH space has more connections so your chances to get access to Null from a C4, C5, C6 is way higher compared to C1 etc "
---
this is very wrong. its quite the opposite. higher tier wh space (c5/6) typically has fewer connections in general. and you are far more likely to find a ns connect (or k space connects in general) out of a c1, 2, or 3 then a c4 and up any day.

---
your understanding is wrong. I'd say the vast majority of the players wouldn't even recognize the imp being an AT ship if it landed on their grid while they're ratting or whatever.
---
ok what the heck is going on Wednesdays in C1 wormholes
---
So amarr/caldari if you really need access to good trade hubs. Otherwise just look at FW corps and find a group that you like. It’s important to join a Corp in FW to get involved and get the most out of it and being with a group that fits you is what matters most.

Yep. That was the whole point of that change. :D

I think this is the problem. In no way should a succubus have an MWD fit.
---
I don't know what you're trying to say in the latter half of your post so I'm just not going to engage with it.
---
The difference between the punishments is pretty simple; Brisc used confidential, proprietary information he had access to in breach of a contract. Punitively CCP has banned him.
---
Pando and Dark Shines utilized confidential information that was not available to the general playerbase, and therefore received a lesser punitive term of 1 year.
---
The punishments will not have been arbitrary, and will be in line with guidance that the GMs have been given to operate on within the constraints of their roles.
---
What’s his taste of porn? Midgets and hentai?

Thanks for the tips.  I'm only doing the 6 or 7 day pulls.  I dont think I'll put more than one up.  I could see the value of doing ladders of multiple refineries with 30 day cycles and having one pop out each week.  I'm hoping that being a single man Corp with alts will keep me off the radar.  Worse case pull everything I can during a war dec.

AAR: While scouting the chain on a lonely cold night, one of our scanners received a convo invite! The informant passed along word of a ref'd fortizar located inside a C4 wormhole in another chain. After gathering intel for a few days leading up to the final timer, we seeded a large heavy armor fleet the night prior and logged off at a safe. 
---
The next night, we sat on the character select screen eager to know who and how many would show up (we had next to no intel on who was attacking or defending). To our surprise, an attacking and defending fleet showed up: The german corp Little Red Riding Hole to attack the fort, and the defending batphone of sinners/stranger/adhoc/opsec to protect the fort. 
---
As the invulnerability timer ticked closer to zero, the Little Red Riding Hole gang tried to establish hole control on the C3, but were quickly dispatched by the overwhelming force of the batphone brigade. Assuming the battle had been won, the batphone fleet warped back to the fortizar. 
---
We decided to not fight on the fort grid, due to not knowing if the enemies had capitals plus fighting on a fort grid is annoying. So, our vanguard gang who were positioned on the static C5 started smack talking local (they had been sitting there for about 13 mins unnoticed by the defenders). This finally got the attention of the defenders, who very eagerly warped their entire fleet on top of our bait gang. The video above starts as everyone logs in and warps to the C5 to save our bait fleet and start what would be a very fun fight.
---
It's creating even more history and jobs.  They were having funding problems anyway.  Jessie Smollett would be proud.
---
Yup try to avoid hauling ore to a trade hub if you can that’ll keep you off the war deccers radars.  Find a local (3-4 jumps in any direction) buyer and establish some reliable trade.  If you can set yourself up as the gniess supplier they may start to pay u better for that reliable supply.  Try to be self sufficient with PI for fuel and avoid making market trips.  Use Red Frog to deliver goods to an NPC station not located where your operations are.  Those guys are trustworthy but their ships do attract tails to find their customers.  
---
Above all make friends locally.  Making an offer early when you’re setting up will pay you back when you need help.   As I found my athanors became THE mining source in the system.  The other guys all bought orcas and exhumers.  thus when I was wanting to sell the buyer was already there.  
---
Avoid rigging them too.  When the day comes to sell it’s easier if the structure is scooped and able to be moved.   Rigs are generally a sunk cost.  If you feel like using a rig is a good investment, just be prepared that a rig cost is an expense and not part of the investment.   The rig is designed to make YOU more ore/minerals.  Any return you get for rigs is to be considered a bonus.
---
This. All of this!
---
Almost no one ever remembers or uses more than the first 3 characters in a system name. It's never been necessary.

The data I gave them would have included their original dataset, this is zkb kills reported for the last month roughly so older kills sometimes appear as they're reported.

From jurrasic park, " it starts with ooo,  wow, and sutch,  then there's running, screaming and all.." I'll put a buck on the latter. But anyhow, god luck trying to deploy again.

Maybe you should have commented this in the actual post, instead of making your own?

Something to think about.

I'm sorry but there is absolutely nothing wrong with CCP removing features for literally no reason.

As it should be! :-)

Just release it or no one will give a shit..

I do declare this quite the thread.
---
Why are there so many cosmetic items in the game that I've never, in many years, seen drop or for sale?
---
I've always wanted a Right Odin Synthetic Eye but I've never seen them actually exist. There's a lot of cosmetics like this - what gives?
---
I'm convinced this Abyssmal shit is the brainchild of Hilmar's little niece.  They're doing EVERYTHING to try to get people to run these stupid things.

You jump one of those minows in, it has what 35k Gj of cap?  You are draining like ~400 gj/s just repping yourself.  You can barely run your Tank for the time it takes your Cap Booster to reload lmao, let alone try to fucking rep anyone.

You jump in, and this fucking thing is useful for about 100s.

TLDFuckingR; Read the Dev blogs

Stupid chinks

I am sorry to disappoint!
---
Would whoring with a Target Painter also work?
---
He's leaving the company permanently
---
unless your alliance is very lenient on srping logi ships, sure (tbh it's probably not a good idea to fit a target painter)
---
I went over the patch summaries however its hard to really get what is important and what isnt, I also dont really fancy watching 4 years worth of dev blogs. 
---
Personally I much prefer to engage with and chat to the playerbase as the information directly from a player is going to be fresh and leave out unimportant parts.  
---
TLDFuckingR; I prefer a conversation with real people over raw data or a longwinded devblog. sorry if this somehow personally offended you or ruined your day, oh redditor.
---
Especially gotg ones
---
Honestly, Abyssal content is not the worst possible. The new ships have brought out new metas, abyssal PVP gives you that guaranteed 1v1 that can be hard to get in EVE and its wonderful for the ingame economy since whenever a player dies to rats its a 100% module sink. All those faction/deadspace modules go in, but don't come out. Implants included.
---
That and abyssal RNG magic did not make faction etc mods obsolete, if anything they probably simply increased certain modules usage but thats it.
---
I have no clue how or who thought this fits in with any Quality Of Life changes that have been made.  
---
No one asked for this!
---
Surely you can't bee so racist
---
It's also fun with character search. I gift game time to my alts using the new eden store. 
---
Buy as gift &gt; search for character 'Exact-Name'
---
It comes up with every variation of characters with exact and name in their name with no final verification screen. EVE gui has always been and will always be a mess.
---
Sadly there is no other options for finding if the moons are fractured. If you don't own them you can always add contacts as an off color and watch for them in system. I do this with a few people that own solo athanors in my area. Whenever they show up in system time to go mine their moon
---
You really did an amazing job with iterating on the data, glad I could help!
---
that sec status lol
---
Is it possible it was a fleet abyssal trace that never got entered? Maybe you spooked the pilots before they jumped in. Unlike solo traces fleet traces spawn as a gate you have to activate and I'd guess the 20 minute timer doesn't actually start until someone takes the gate.
---
The real question is: who cares?  It's not exactly causing any harm.
---
Nah probably just some lazy ass who Google imaged searched a bee pic, based on the image lower on the van which is similar but totally unrelated.
---
Wormhole bros, whats with the spike in kills just after 00:00, given that other spikes track quite well with peak eve hours (16:00-20:00)

have you seen the masteries, that could be a thing lol

The technology is there, it gives you a button to click if you're extracting SP and need to get into a pod, so I have no idea why it doesn't give you a button to click if you're JC'ing

Honestly, there are a bunch of stuff like this that will improve the feel of the game. Like, do not tell me I can't change ships for three seconds just queue it and tell me how long till the action will happen.
---
Dont turn around
---
&gt; The real question is: who cares?
---
&gt;proceeds to write sentences about to display lack of care
---
Um, well, how about, no?
---
To be blunt, your questions aren't short answers.   If you really wanna know, jump back in as an alpha clone (free to play) and look around at what's new.  Hop in a rookie channel and ask there or toss another subredit up with more pointed questions.  For the long in short, yes, a lot has changed, you should come back and at least try it if you once liked it, and fly safe o7

maybe you should realize that you're not responding to the original poster

&gt; may have a chance of working is the idea of not spending isk.

drop down to alpha. learn to make isk. once you manage that and have three months PLEX banked sub one Omega. continue to get better at making isk. when you have 6 months PLEX banked sub a second Omega. 12 months for the third. let it snowball.

Who cares?

whoa that summary is good to know. thanks for that. ive been avoiding c4-6 but if im only looking for connections i'll be sure to head into those to get to null. thanks again.
---
I tried to get into this game years ago and was killed often and without mercy. I have heard of guilds and the like that will help newbies get through that initial learning curve and help them on their way. Any suggestions as to a large, friendly group I should look into. Re-downloading the game as I type this.
---
yeah did some more research I see what you mean. I'll be chilling in my astero for now and just joined a wh corp. thanks for the info.
---
Gaze upon the bounty that the one true Bob hath bestowed upon you heathens

yeah i think i'll steer clear for now, joined a wh corp so when they are on i'll be talking to them about what i should be getting into / what the corp is getting into. thanks for the info.

TY sir

this

also ratting is ratting, mining which is still pve isn't called ratting
---
also complex isn't ratting
---
killing RATS....killing Pi-rat-es. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE ! thank you
---
your words sting like the day after taco bell night.
---
I mean, yeah its unfortunate but the login process is probably an ancient relic that hasnt been touched for literally years, and I would rather them put that development time to making cooler shit and fixing more pressing issues (like the sesson timer thing, CCPLS) than me wasting an extra minute logging in another character... But thats just me
---
Not all of PvE is called "ratting".
---
Ratting specifically refers to flying around looking for "rats", meaning the NPC pirates that spawn in belts or other locations. Then you kill them, possibly loot, or wait for the bounty money to roll in.
---
Any other form of PvE is excluded from this term. Missions, Incursions, Mining, etc.
---
&gt;calling for backup in an imp LOL.     
---
     
---
Yeah that about sums up the vid. (His fleetmate said this)
---
Timezones would rock. I had the same thought as I was curious how skewed high class are to the Russian bear holes. It looks like low class are all clustered around what I assume is US/EU prime time, but 6 isn’t. Maybe not just clustering but call outs for interesting data points for the lazy consumer (i.e. me).
---
That’s when the late night US/EU stalkers finally pay off and the Russians start logging in.

hardly surprising from a corp that had will motsu in tbvh.

A lot of these quality of life things contribute to the new player experience. Given a large enough sample size you probably have some new players quit before they even get to noticing session timers.
---
ok
---
Of course. Haha. Well not posting from mobile new posts anymore.
---
Trademark infringement is serious business.
---
atleast you dont have to pause skill training anymore
---
people don't necessarily quit from these small issues, but it pushes them more towards it
---
can i have your stuff first
---
Honest this comes up a lot and is shot down time and time again.
---
It will require 100s of hours of dev time and there is just too little to gain. This and having a change of character button will require to much work when the devs can be working on things that are fun or better for the game.

except the keepstar doesn't have the market share where the money is.

60k dps cap isnt that hard to keep up.

tiericide is literally renaming items and changing integer values- that's not finished after 5 years

OUCH bro
---
Unlike you, I will dab to you in sympathy
---
If the ks went down the plex sellers would likely move to stations until a new cit went up and stayed up long enough for people to trust it. Prices would rise due to taxes and pissed off sellers trying to recoup some asset safety losses.
---
Good AAR/Video... why'd you wait til 2 months after to post?

intaki syndicate thinks its a little weird too and sits idle in the corner pondering that very fact. Suddenly intaki syndicate sighs, they stand.. and then sit back down again.

Can I give you isk to stop posting?

youve been out of the game a very long while.. and you came back and joined test.. so i guess you probably wont be back in long then..

Didn't the Goons jack it from somewhere else to begin with?

&gt; somewhere you get hit

:ok_hand:

But guys, its more streamlined!  Functional UI is outdated.   CCP has made their stance clear on this in the past.

alts in different alliances for krabbing

No we made it
---
Before you go nuclear on them, keep in mind that they probably paid a branding company to do their designs for them and it is likely that branding company who stole it.
---
only two questions.  
---
1. Who at ccp decided to change the rorqual from a rather powerful mining support ship to a ridiculously powerful mining ship seemingly without a thought or care about the ingame (playermade) economy ccp seems to covet so much.. oh and made it an invincible cyno to boot?  
---
2. why didnt anyone, at any point, take into account that the people asking for a nerf to combat ceptors didnt actually fly them and the calls of 'no counterplay' came from titan pilots that hotdrop frigates?
---
I know what you mean, so not trying to be pedantic. Posting here for others who may want to invoke Texas Bird Law. Sorry TEXAS BIRD LAW. 
---
What you would need is a trademark and those go for around $300ish dollars per class of good or service to file. 
---
So, while it is possible it was registered, it wouldn’t necessarily be an infringement to use a bee with a helmet and cigar somewhere else.
---
AUTZ is dead as usual...
---
The lower bee is the Goon blops logo.
---
Hey that’s my kill
---
You are required by law to enforce your trademark rights when you become aware of a violation or you can lose your rights to the mark. 
---
That’s why you see big companies going after violations that otherwise seem ridiculous or mean spirited. Trademark law doesn’t give owners leeway to pick and choose who to go after. You either own the mark and do the work to protect it or you don’t and lose it forever.
---
You had a medium neut, this seems like pilot error to me.
---
First, CSM8 told CCP ESSes were a bad idea for a variety of reasons, of which this was merely one. Then EVE players came out and told CCP ESSes were a bad idea for a variety of reasons, of which this was merely one. Anchoring them next to a POS wasn't even the most egregious place you could anchor them in 2014. The first big batch of ESSes were anchored inside null-sec anoms with tons of scram rats. Guess whose idea *that* was.
---
When these concerns were raised, players were told the Big Lie: that it would be iterated on.
---
So no, placing ESSes in completely safe locations isn't new. It's something that's been done from pretty much the first week they were introduced.
---
I don’t care I don’t live in the UK nor do I own the rights lol
---
shit when did you guys end your deployment from last year?
---
i thought you guys deployed to make test homeless
---
did that deployment end without test becoming homeless?
---
Where did you even get that?
---
Yes this so much.  It's so unnecessary.
---
If its expensive we split it after paying for any losses, otherwise ffa; usually.  
---
There are other cases though, like someone getting us kills in which case yeh hunter takes the loot - but theres usually a splitting anyway.  
---
Were a small corp though so when we get a kill theres not 50+ on it.
---
if theyre dicks defo but if theyre cool in local and it was a gf its always nice to leave them something so they fight you again :)
---
I know this sub gets a lot of shitty low effort crap but Jesus this is just bottom tier dumpster posting.
---
Hadn't thought of this. You say VNI ratting, so I assume you mean in a Forsaken Hub?
---
As far as my mining setup I run a barge and an exhumer with a porpoise booster. No idea how I make such shit isk. I mined out two freighters worth of minerals (750k refined) in a week and only made half a bil. Maybe 100k a day with those ships, mining at least 4 hours.
---
It escapes me.
---
Maybe alpha ratting till I get better is not a shit idea.
---
who are brand newbros and why not eve uni?
---
I heard the Autism Cartel is recruiting :-)
---
jesus fuck
---
Yeah I suppose it’s easier to split between smaller groups, I mean usually in our standing fleets between 10-20 people usually get on most of the kill mails and it still would be difficult to split between that many people in most cases
---
You're a bit.... unstable.
---

as someone said above, the feature is right there with the extration skill mechanic, you only have to include it in the clone stuff.

Hire Brisc, I hear he has a lot of free time now :)

Blocked in NZ, cause of the music. yay (/s)

Because past like 15–20 dps ships alpha matters more than dps that requires spooling

It was sarcasm, obviously there’s some sort of article missing, but you carry on being a tosser.
---
Hope you enjoy your ban. Eve is so good now you cant get in XD
---
Nice.
---
Trig ships are not overpowered, they just fulfill their  niche well (whaling). This is like getting bombed in a bs fleet and then bitching about how bombers are op
---
To be fair thats mostly do to groups camping the kspace hole looking for people that cant dscan
---
Half of all nullsec systems have a tac in the first three characters and the first three characters are all most of us remember.
---
Please fix your shit, CCP; I'm old and don't like to learn new tricks.
---
What even is the new trick that you could possibly learn? more letters? ugh I hat this so mulch.
---
I mean if you like cycling DD green 4 times over the span of 8 hours, then Goons is definitely the place for you then.
---
Calling anyone 'The best' is always subjective. But Vily and Elo are pretty good at what they do

Judging by this video he's leaving on pretty good terms, so it's always possible he'll return. Likely, probably not, but possible.

Looking forward to the *memoirs*.

Make a corporation for your market alt, get 7 wallet sections.

Wow, amazing insight! I didn't think CCP would be so willing to do so much for one player! I hope more people are willing to buy their work along with myself so they can make more money and keep going as a company.

Not going to read yet another long-winded thing you've written, which I assume is yet another attempt at "CCP EVIL, OTHERS GOOD" dumbshit you've copy/pasted elsewhere. I will say, however, I find it fucking amazing that you, the guy who was in the fucking middle of the[ doxxing incident in Darkness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8e4zak/postmeeting_kenshin_dox_comms_kenshin_ceo_dont/) and the whole MICROSOFT ARESENAL thing thinks that he has the fucking merit to weigh in about any kind of trust on anything. [The same guy who argues with people](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b5stez/so_lets_talk_about_the_bigotry_in_eve_here_since/ejgr5or/) about what they should be offended by on this sub. Seriously shut the fuck up and stop posting.
---
either store your isk in plex or in items in a double wrapped container so CCP can't remove it
---
The black hand delivers.
---
Hah, was waiting for you to respond :) that train is never late.   
---
You agree you didn't read it so its just toxic hate now fueling you. You cite a heavily edited audio file which has large amounts of context removed but suited the narrative of the day (Goons vs Darkness) and a quote by me where i'm being sarcastic in advocating that the appeal to authority by one person as female isn't the spokesperson for all.  
---
If anything you proved one of points ... toxicity is ripe here.
---
Oh fuck off with that worthless shit. Why can every braindead rat become a "journalist" these days?
---
Top kek, You can see the moment at 11 seconds where Admiral Griggs realised he forgot to refit for combat and got volleyed.
---
I would like to trade a Falcon for a Logibro,  please. I mean while the roster is changing, this is the time to make requests.
---
Hello Atomskie, once you get a hang of it, you will love this game as we all do. In its own weird way.
---
Newbie groups : do all agents missions + SOE arch mission at first. Once completed - feel free to apply to Brave Newbies, Karmafleet, Ascendance, Pandemic Horde, Brand Newbros.
---
I personally found Pandemic Horde to be easiest to get into. Lots of pew pew and ISK making oportunities, lot of nice people that will help you get set.
---
You can get them with triexporter or made them youself. The rokhs are using the standard textures and the rifters are self made
---
thank you for explaining. that's a well thought calculation then.  Nice job
---
Fuck off, dude. Seriously
---
Well that was a boring read.
---
You can extract them with triexporter (YouTube that workaround) or made them youself procedurally or in substance. Models are uvmapped allready
---
So basically screw anything that isn't. Arty, rails or trig.
---
You were waiting for me? Because I've responded to you what? Literally two times ever? Kind of weird for you to wait on me.
---
My post history isn't toxic. I call people out for being dumb. I'm sorry that you're the equivalent of a smooth-brain super-hero, and I'm sure that looks great on a resume, but your barely legible writing skills and idiotic apples-to-oranges comparisons make this look like a 5th grader drummed this up for a class he didn't particularly care about but wanted to blame someone anyway. Disagreeing with someone who has threatened real-world stuff over a video game isn't toxic, someone who somehow thinks he has the right to weigh in about trust.
---
I'm a newbro and don't know much about CCP Guard, but he totally looked like he was jizzing when he touched that stone.
---
&gt; You cite a heavily edited audio file which has large amounts of context removed but suited the narrative of the day
---
I love how there could possibly be a context for doxxing that would make it OK. I love that your stupid narrative has gone from "IM SORRY" to "That shit was edited". Jesus, once a subhuman always a subhuman I guess.

Are you referring to CCP or CCP-US?

Would be good to be able to store multiple clones in a single station. Also what if you could transport a clone in your cargo hold? Move them around without having to jump between them?

Wow, I thought the comments here had to be blowing it out of proportion, but nope, that was just bad. Rulebreaking-apologisim aside, the number of basic typographic and grammatical errors is just sad. Did you read through that at all before you posted it?

Dude, did you even proofread before you posted? Or are you just illiterate?
---
Would you say that threatening someone with the entire Microsoft arsenal is a breach of trust?
---
given that building a carrier now  it's damn easy (or it was, let's see with the nerfs to Rorqs). It makes sense to get a BPC pack from Jita with 20-30 mil isk and build it inside. Same goes for dreads.

I also have one. Make filters for inventory more complex. Now i can only choose 'is' and 'is not'. I would love to have OR and AND
---
Or you know, alternatively you could play the game one-eyed
---
I feel like the game would lose its depth...
---
They came last year and that didn't go well.
---
yeah we all have the same. one brain up, one brain down... why are you so special ?
---
Pretty much. When you see a 30 man coordinated response fleet you know that the FAX aren't far behind. We could have stayed for a while longer if we killed the Huginn quickly. But a Huginn has the potential of shutting us down completely. The logi Lokis have an extremely short optimal range, so if anyone gets webbed we either have to let that person die or slow down and turn around.

We paid the guy who made it.

I see what you did there.
---
Yeh no.
---
The 1v1 you talk about is just people in supertanked fits playing rock paper scissors. the enforced PVE before hand pretty much makes this a requirement. it'd be like trying to do FW plex's but having to clear a level 3/4 mission beforehand. it limits what you can actually DO  
---
So we end with rock/paper/scissors. its either you played the wrong card, or you both explode. the game of gila/orthrus/curse/deimos continues.  
---
That is only pvp in the most basic sense of the word. the same as market manipulation being counted as a form of pvp.
---
Anyone who does any form of pvp. solo, fleet, small gang, hunters can see that its the most bastardized form possible(whether they personally enjoy it or not). taking away alot of what makes eve pvp so damn interesting.  
---
Am glad for the isk sink tho. gotta throw that endless rorqual isk somewhere! and abyssal mods and new ships are the new fresh idea since T3D's and Command dessies.  
---
As to what mikal says about suspect flags.
---
Honestly. ive always wanted Abyssal stuff to be low/null/wormhole only. doesn't mean its not safe. just means u gotta find a quiet corner or have friends nearby to bail your ass out, gets people out of the kiddy pool of highsec, more than enough space to go around!

TLDR

Jesus fuck i have too much time on my hands.

i was hunting bots for a while , and it's fking boring.

Or, make it popup "you must leave your ship, do you wish to leave your ship and proceed with this jump?" just because I've misclicked before and I will misclick again.

Go write for buzzfeed you bottom feeder.

Trust? What trust? Send me your isk and I double it. It's simple as that.

Deploying them at zero on a PDS equipped Fortizar was a bit of a giggle.

dang man. no need to be mean. he just asked a question.

Lol!
---
You would need a clone vat bay or something.  Can't just fit that in a standard hold.  
---
Multiple clones in a station should be a thing though.
---
For real though, I there a way to do this with my bank?
---
Someone is losing a Titan for this...
---
We should be able to turn isk into items like plex, then you could have a container full of ones and exotic dancers.

Then that will become a mess of who has rights to access the ESS and such. Give someone a role and suddenly they can access the ESS, unanchor all structures and whatnot...
---
don't pop up and waste my time with stale jokes when I accidentally drag a ship into its cargo hold ..
---
They want to keep it secret fine, but should't throw blind accusations then.
---
In any case, what CCP did is disgusting.

They could have resigned and banned him for any reason but done so diplomatically, not act like a bunch of immature sjw's.

How exactly does ship probing work?  I pretty much entirely work as an explorer, clearing data and relic sites.  My work often takes me into hostile low-sec, so I've been on the receiving end of being probed down (usually ends poorly for me unless I catch a lucky bounce and can cloak in my covops)
---
Is it like what I see when I'm looking at signatures?  I.e., my ship shows up as a signature, they resolve it, and can warp to me?  If I then cloak or warp to another location, do they have to re-probe me?
---
It's more damage. Do you want more damage?
---
I will let you know in 9 days
---
Those are not the dreads you looking for.....
---
need strat index 5 to get that water purification ihub upgrade
---
Most common is effing up on some lazy ass corps capital ratting op because they didn't bother on proper hole control.
---
Well i mostly do some piracy in higsec ... killing all those nasty people with negative standings towards the Sansha Nation.
---
Get a combat prob launcher and you will see. It's pretty much the same yes. If you are cloaked they can't scan you. If they scan you, then you cloak, then will land on you grid with you. If you warp after they scan you, they will land at your former location.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
Not much for an alliance bug much for a player unless test gave srp
---
Now the other test Rorq pilots feel more unsafe, possibly hitting test alliance income a lot.
---
Your home is where your heart is.
---
You mean a fleet on muninns through no fatigue jump gates and shitting out so many fax the rorqual can't die?
---
I'll pay you 100 dollars to never post again.
---
Your point being?
---
Dropping caps on goons trying to roll their wormholes is a good sport.
---
&lt;3
---
Just drop a fax if you want to steal isk in defended sov ...
---
Yes
---
Probably because latter involves 2 session changes.

You are meanies, how dare you bring a counter.
---
And, to be honest, that fit would have drained itself of cap once it actually tried to do anything without you guys neuting it.  Truly awful.
---
&gt;Such allegations were delivered in a way that left more questions than they answered
---
No it didn't.
---
Only a few INIT retards actually asks questions about this, the rest of EVE couldn't give a fuck, they are banned for breaking the rules, end of story.
---
Also your comparison is completely retarded. In EVE, having intel of changes to come could literally make you trillions of isk, you can change outcome of wars, crush markets, etc. Of course CCP needs a zero tolerance policy on NDA braking.
---
yes
---
if you don't like causing damage fly an ibis
---
In my first year my favourite ship was the Condor, which was, that time, not symmetric. (One of its wings were lowered.)
---
I did not like it.
---
Then CCP decided to make it symmetric.
---
I don't like this change.
---
you missed a bit

Well, it explains why it looked so crisp. I figured it was some fancy python library.

This better be flying the space lanes. Indestructible and unlockable.

You can get domains in the base .uk zone, without the .co prefix?

Make a new alpha account, make a new character on it that you will never normally login to use and send it the isk you want safe.

Very nice mate!

I bet you would also like your skill queue to automatically pause, do the session change, and then automatically restart, right? Amiright?
---
Would you also like a blowjob and a reefer when you arrive in the new station?
---
Does level 5 fighters unlock your lowsec gate?
---
You are ignoring the 3rd component of intent and knowledge. Harm, microsoft getting an idea leaked might lose out on the exclusivity of that idea and maybe some profit from it as a result. The harm that could come to CCP from a loss in confidence from leaks like this could destroy their entire bottom line. 
---
CSM have enough insider information that if they were just allowed to leverage it to get ahead in the game all the time it would ruin the whole game. Did your project with microsoft give those insiders enough information to bring down .net as a product entirely?
---
It's "deploying them at zero as a drag bubble to gate on a PDS equipped Fortizar" for that short time it lasted. Was hilarious.

---
Unfortunately in a game full of scammers and oathbreakers, a financial system does not work, particularly when there's no oversight body or ways for redress.
---
If I took out a loan and kept the capital, what can you do about it?
---
Everyone likes to talk about the idea of owning shares in corporations and stuff, but the RL financial industry is built almost entirely on trust (which is a terrifying concept), and punishment if trust is breached. Neither of those exist within Eve
---
Jita Scamming 101
---
If there was one guy who was able to motivate me to play this game, it was CCP Guard.
---
Only 10M ISK....
---
And a mere 500 PLEX.
---
&gt; bably because latter involves 2 session changes.
---
But WHY?
---
Seizing foreclosed assets could be enforced by game mechanics as an extension of the regular contracts system. Then you could run scams just like a real bank by offering a loan with ridiculous collateral to someone who likely can't pay so you can take all their shit.
---
Imagine the torment! How exciting :)
---
'once worked as .NET product manager for Microsoft' for all of 5 minutes before they launched you and your cat into the sun. 
---
You write like you have a 3rd class degree
---
Needing to log out to manage the skill queue of alt chars on the same account isn't really a new player issue.
---
I thought I was going crazy the other day before I figured out what was going on. Guess the CCP version of the saying goes "if it ain't broke, hold our beer".
---
Since it's data for relatively short timespan (~month) it may be some evictions.
---
There is a mobile space themed base builder that rips a few things off from eve, the goon bee being one of them, wish I could remember the name
---
Thanks for your help.

In before bug and or oversight allows rapid movement of Super Capitals via jump clone.

On torpedo bombers it changes a lot.

Are you named after the spaceship?

My greatest aim in Eve is to fly the blingest ship I can afford, bath myself in the blood of enemies then die in fire.

I just don't understand NS people who farm in multiple Rorq/super then fly cheap SRP T1 ship for pvp

Knights of CODE. they will show you that hunting people that do missions, mining or hauling is much more fun than doing those things.

Does it make you any more desirable as a corp member?

Well i guess person that have a goal of hvy bombers to lvl 5 is more desired than guy aiming for excavators/rorqual V

Yes, it shows that the recruiter didnt scrape the bottom of the barrel when recruiting you.

Actually no. I chose it as my name back when I used to write graffiti as a combination of cool looking letters that were easy to draw. Years later I started playing EVE and found out about the ship.

I believe they compute few data to "know" if a system is occupied by a corp or not. (it's obviously not 100% true results, but still gives insights)

in the past before jumping to another clone, it wasa requirement to stop yuor trainign queue first. As you can imagine if you were in a rush you might forget to actuallt start the queue back again

Oh well I'm sure they be back soon with the annual tuck tails between their legs return stating we dont want sov  and it's just for good fires rhetoric..for the 1000th time..

In a serious note eve needs a serious shake up and God I wish PL and NC would come back and do shit like they used to..I feel those days are sadly behind us.

yeah, sorry, apparently you guys are not allowed to listen to ZZ Top

Let's be real. The only action the heavy fighters will see is in a haven.
---
I do it with an alt that warps to anom in Noctis same time as carrier, drops the MTU and warp out until rats spawn. Then, MTU will pull wrecks as they are killed, no need to wait few hours as neuts my come to systems hunting MTUs as usual. This is in Q pocket anyway, which most of the time is somewhat quiet.  I do 8 sites  at a time (alt has 8 MTU), then come with the Noctis salvage everything, switch to industrial pickup loot and MTUs. It's a bit of overhead to do it but it works once you get into the pace.
---
Or y´all keep to internet spaceships and relax? Dunno man, maybe i´m too chill about this.
---
Eves weirdly come back up as the devs listened for a bit and decided to make it a bit more destructive.
---
Theres still superumbrellas and all kinds of cancer with citadels but yes its getting better somehow, atleast how i feel about it
---
I am still waiting for +3 +4 accelerators that i can use instead of implants that are lost when you get podded.            
---
Even if this cost me a more in the "long run" not worrying about basic learning implants could be good.        
---
Even removing all learning attributes from implants is a solution.
---
Great work here

from the very beginning they seemed to play it very safe on the PoV.

Ah yes, just what this game needs, more SP!

Yes it’s very annoying

spoilers: you lose the accelerators too.

Wormholes bestholes
---
Wasn't relevant, you only stopped us for like 2 out of 15 hours till we moved to thera, in the end it might have actually benefited us because we had therabois as backup and an easy way to reship/get new members into the fleet.

Only thing we know is that it'll be another industry.

He got a bunch of gifts on stage from his colleagues and several players at EVEsterdam as well, so yeah, it's definetely on good terms.

I could have sworn I just saw this like a couple days ago?

Or was it just the ships involved per class?  Am I going crazy?
---
Take it one step further and allow us to sell items from inside station containers.  It's realllllly frustrating not being able to do so.
---
1) You are going crazy of course, it's /r/Eve after all...
---
2) Yep, posted version with much less data and info couple of days ago.
---
Under the EULA all works produced in the game are under the proprietary rights of CCP and assigned to them.
---
By virtue of its inclusion in the game it has been assigned to CCP, so any enforcement for copyright breach would have to come from them.
---
It’s not a trademark as it is not a mark affixed in commercial practice to brand a good or service by CCP.
---
All in all it’s probably not worth the headache of pursuing a man and van IT repair guy.

Oh good, on both accounts

this is too hard and challenging for humanity of the future

Yeah but you only lose part of one accelerator, which is a lot less than the value of the equivalent implants.
---
Data.

Some years back, two characters was enough.
---
Then it became three..
---
And now... well .

Not quite the same, but i feel the same about the Slasher model.

The new one looks sick, but i want the old one back.

The old condor looked sick as well.
---
&gt;mining: small gangs
---
It was produced outside of the game and then introduced to the game , just because I produce a copy of the Bible in game does not give CCP the rights to it.
---
I should probably look for a new corp at some point soon too... it'd be more fun than running solo.
---
true, but not because of an increase of player numbers on the chinese server
---
Yeah, the mosquito models were damn nice.
---
Did you hear about the NSA changes ? 60 secs is more than enough for a Nullsec static wh to pop up and the Sabre landing in your Anom.
---
I remember years ago someone was talking about ship design in that they wanted to show the players they weren't cheating us by flipping textures, so they intentionally made ships asymmetrical. 
---
Made sense for Minmatar since they are held together with duct tape age chewing gum. Hell if their ships had random procedurally generates designs it would make sense.
---
But yeah, a lot of ships looked really stupid and literally half of every factions ships were asymmetrical, just for the sake of it. The Condor looked like a wing was broken. The Vexor had tubes that looked vulnerable and incomplete. 
---
Other ships looked... Off and unbalanced for literally no reason other than to be so. A few ships pull it off like the catalyst...
---
Yes. And now for the perplexing part, I'm French.
---
oh hey, it's that paranoid ex STK guy again lol!
---
The only reason it doesn't is because you don't have the proprietary right to assign ownership of the Bible.
---
The assignment is a condition for the license to access the game. It's also a condition for permitting user submitted art to be admitted to the game; otherwise any numpty could challenge CCP's inclusion of player made alliance logos.
---
I'd be very comfortable challenging jurisdiction to strike out any claim raised by GoonSwarm directly, citing the court isn't entitled to hear a dispute which doesn't feature the party involved. I would demand evidence that CCP has granted you enforcement rights for their intellectual property, and my view is you would struggle to secure this.

Again they’re showing up to shoot horde.

Also, do “allies in a strategic relationship” still then roam for kills in a home system?

It does if you want to use it as an alliance logo, you have to sign papers giving them the rights

And remove cooldown when you switch to a clone in the same NPC station. Just like in citadels.

Nice. Lubo was a monster in 1994, nothing wrong with being a fan. I'll never forget that match.

Good question. I ignored all shattered.
---
At start I wanted to gather some information about where people live, so cut shattered whs as ones that is uninhabited by default.
---
But after you asked, I actually wonder how much action happens there... And it seems that wh info I used is lacking details on shattered, they all set as class "0" without statics.
---
My nigerian banker friend my be able to help you, just send all your isk and he will handle it for you

Carriers weren't nerfed until this patch for a good reason too right?

Right?
---
+3/+4 implants are like 30-40m for a set... And 100m for the +4 set... Pretty sure of my 7 characters with +4 or +5s I have lost one training clone set ever... Just get the training implants and be done lol.... Instead of a +3/+4 booster you would have to consume every day or two.
---
Now for the reason I came here.... YES please to +7s, I'd love another 2,160 SP per day, even at prob half a bill each I'd do it.

And people wonder why EVE isn't a more popular game.
---
Quit refining your ore, compress it and contract it to market for a little bit. Or move it yourself, refine what you cannot compress and use those minerals. I have a extra ore container where I put the leftover ore after compression. Once the 1 mil m3 is full I'll compress then refine and use those minerals for industrial jobs. Building my first and second rorq at the moment.

I am well aware of the "fairness" of eve players... or humans in general.

How about the time a woman player applied to our corp where management went on a doxxing "witch hunt" trying to prove she was a spy and the many misogynous comments directed towards this individual.

What a corp does is its business and not mine. So no, again I don't care.

Or the countless ignorant and racist memes?

I mean, its the internet so you could say that about any corp right?

I wonder who has the rights if you sign the papers when you don’t have the rights to it
---
muh grimdark!
---
That's an interesting way to approach it, and somewhat surprising (but I guess understandable since alliances may co-opt other people's artistic works into their designed logos).
---
The problem with that definition is that by definition, a derivative work must feature a substantial alteration thereby making the new work a distinct piece, and depending on the jurisdiction, their entitlement to protect copyright would only go so far as the alterations to the original works, only.
---
It certainly puts CCP in a weaker position. It also conflicts with the position in the EULA s.10(A) which covers all images within the game as being owned by CCP.
---
The jump clone system needs a major overhaul (2nd only to bookmarks imo). Separating implant sets and jump clones ('beacons'). Would be a great 1st step.
---
The sad thing is most the things you are calling for would likely have been in CCP's vision like 10 years ago when jump clones were introduced but it's limits of the way they were coded that two clones can't have the same station ID.
---
I still think that the allowing to jump to a clone in the citadel you're currently in while you're still on cooldown was a bug rather then a feature which they kept in.

Do you know how easy it would be for them to make +50 implants and create a new text string to name them? There's nothing wasted here, implants aren't slowly grown in a augmentation laboratory by CCP.

Is the van itself under the cap umbrella?  Can’t JU- Standing just show him its tits?  DD the IT nerd...

Stop asking for this, they have replied multiple times it ain't happening because of legacy code

Even mine is, just need more DPS cuz otherwise I need too much time

There is a fair bit of history surrounding this particular issue. CCP tried to claim all Alliance artwork and it set off a bit of a shitstorm.

Not my problem, stopped super ratting 3 years ago, but I can imagine all the krabs screaming "but muh ticks" if all sub BS NPCs take a minute to lock literally ...
---
Interesting. Legally, their position would be sound. I could see it being problematic commercially though, as players would like to retain ownership of their creations.
---
This meme again?!
---
I still think of the days when you had to train short skills while logged in or with a timer/app. Then switch to longer overnight to not waste training time.

What if you loot an active clone with implant you had the choice to steal like 100k sp or take the implant...

How to get started in FW? The goal is 1v1 PvP, not isk/LP. The guides I find focus too much on how to plex but I want to find out which frigates are good for Caldari FW and things of that nature.

haha, I don't play League of Legends, and I quite like Iceland.

Nosprey is another option... Orthrus... Caracal probably works too if you dictate range.
---
The logo wasn't produced in game. There was a reason CCP were looking down that whole 'make logos look scuffed in game' route for a while to try to make the in game assets unique.
---
this is the whole reason alliance logos are grainy now, so ccp can make it clear that they have copyright on the derivative work of the logo, not the original content.
---
Yes but theire customer base is made up mainly of Internet autists and their response to 'well legally we're well within our rights here' is to reeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Exactly this, you don't give CCP ownership of your logo, you grant them a license to do whatever they want with it.
---
Yes, i've had a few of those this morning.

Also the Is Test the Best.

so much... why would one even think this was a good idea to change...

---
Yes Init you're being very harassed i'm sure.
---
Depending on the size of said butt, we could probably all get behind.
---
That's the thing, when I wrote on the forums about it ages ago, no-one seemed to give a damn.
---
basically they really need the rights to reproduce, distribute, and market using the logos. this allows them to do so without taking complete ownership of the original images.
---
they aren't super interested in copies either.
---
With you there EvE's biggest mistake imo was ditching the browser understandable though
---
Yes, ultimately copies would only serve to promote their core product, EVE Online, which is ultimately of benefit for them.
---
This is an occasion where commercial business decisions will triumph of enforceable legal rights tbh.
---
I can assure you, i'm not DBRB.

Just remember to pay your respective taxes. The #THOTaudit was a thing.

Grab a frigate or destroyer, and fly around black rise looking for fights. Sutonia has a lot of good videos on fits, I’d recommend a comet to start out with, its easy to fly and still very powerful

Afaik they used to be part of it and now are part of Gotg. The coalition list is probably not up to date.
---
&gt;they had been sitting there for about 13 mins unnoticed by the defenders
---
I've flown with Opsec and Sinners. I highly doubt you were unnoticed. More so they warped back to the Fort to secure it. No sense committing your fleet elsewhere if you're tasked with defending a Structure. Wait till the Structure is secure and then go after them.
---
When dng was founded the initial membership base was mostly from the predominantly ustz corp Fweddit. Although the founder (me) is British, ustz has historically had more members and activity. This time round the core membership has come from a variety of eutz corps in addition to old eutz members returning when dng was handed back to me by Mikal.
---
What about when they show up to an Ihub timer in a system with a keepstar? Because that already happened
---
Weekday if they ARE Goons?
---
He is off to be an actor full time? :p
---
Imagine his customer's surprise when they find themselves locked out of their offices with their inventories and bank accounts cleaned out.  Should have done an API check.  Noobs.
---
I don’t want more symmetry but some Amarr ships (battlecruisers) really need some attention.
---
So, looks like the vast majority of kills are camping the wormhole side of the High sec, killing day trippers.
---
TLDR here:  Do your research on what you want them to do/produce/fly and make a plan for each account and character. Don't let EVE become a job - find what you enjoy and do that :)    
---
Speaking as someone who did precisely what you've just described for myself, this can lead to a very deep and complicated rabbit hole. Unless you are really REALLY into mining in null sec/a WH you can seal off I would look into skilling differently. Self sufficiency through mining &amp; industry is rather tedious and unless you have a clear idea about what you want to produce and whether you can sell it reliably, it's going to end up costing you more than you earn. For example, you'd be much more efficient huffing gas in a WH on 2 chars and using the money to buy compressed ore which is refined by one dedicated reprocessing character than using 3 characters to mine for several hours on end (even if it's Orca +boosts &amp; 2 covetors) to harvest it all in the first place. Abyssal Deadspace, fleet or regular, is a pretty nice earner - can you manage 3 accounts simultaneously without Passive income through PI is good if you have the patience for the endless amounts of clicking and enough characters to support it - are you really going to be able to do it every 48 hours or so for optimal resource gathering/manufacturing?   
---
Next when it comes to production, think about how many of each item you need to make to turn a decent profit without over producing and saturating a market. 1000 Medium Trimark Armor Pump I's a week would make you roughly 100m Isk. Not bad as low skillpoint entry manufacturing goes but that's \~1/7th of the whole forge region in terms of supply, its in fact roughly the entire weekly supply for the domain region. Can you consistently sell that every week without updating every 5 mins, bearing in mind each time you do it hurts your profit margin? Better to spread across multiple items to not saturate the market, multiple regions if you feel like it and can take the higher profit but slower returns.  
---
Before you do that you have to get your stuff to the markets as well which means transport. Which market region do you want to aim for? Jita is by far and large the best for consistent sales but you'll have lower profits.  If you're out in null that probably means it need JF'ing which costs money. If you use a WH with a HS static - sometimes it might spit you out 20+ jumps from Jita. You could haul it yourself but that's a half hour trip one way with a T1 hauler sometimes. You can pay someone like PushX or red frog to haul it for you - both excellent services but again costs you money.   
---
For the PVP side of things - this was the most costly lesson for me. Managing 3-4 accounts flying ships with active module management in a combat scenario is the most hectic thing you'll come across. You'll over rep one ship, under rep the other, forget cap boosting here, burn out of range on your tackle, burn out your prop mod on all of them, launch drones but not engage target, forget to launch drones on all accounts entirely. If you're dead set on doing it, fly it simply and fly it cheaply. E.g 3 buffer tanked cruisers are better than 1 active BC with its support capped out/flying off towards the sun. It gets better with practice of course, but don't break your bank/brain trying to bite off more than you can chew.  
---
Bit of a wall of text I know but I think it shows how complicated it can become and the pitfalls you can find yourself in. Best advice is do your research beforehand (sometimes I find that the most fun part but) and make your character plans/remaps appropriately. Once you've got your accounts set up you can skill farm one character to basically make the account pay for itself (you'll want Cybernetics V + 5 implants - biology V is also handy to have), anything extra is your pocket money.   
---
Most importantly though is don't let EVE become a job/chore for you, it'll suck the fun right out of what you enjoy. Find what makes you happy and do that o7
---

hell no, dude

&gt;While bringing the same people whose culture is completely different, especially regarding botting/rmt 
---
Uhhhh what do you think the Chinese culture is? That they unironically and actually encourage botting as a cultural activity or something?  0_o
---
And what other parts of "their culture" is so "different" that they couldn't or shouldn't possibly play eve online with us? Since you're saying "especially in regards to botting", what other way is their culture too different?
---
I still call shenanigans on their claim that the name generator just happened to spit that out.

*gets the popcorn ready* ooo this will be good if it is

Yes, nothing damages the northern rental empire like scamming people for 1b isk, while in an alliance where 1b is nothing.

Never ever ever trust goons....goons dont rent they never have..

Im currently renting from goons and haven't had any issues
---
I was just kidding dude....

So who actually owns the copyright to that image? CCP? The Mitanni? No one?
---
If you don’t have the rights to something I would assume that nullifies any agreement or contract in relation to it
---
+1
---
Please
---
It's an elaborate ploy by goons to harass the northern renters, have them move down south to be scammed and then just join goon instead because there's nowhere else left to go.

It's clearly targeted harassment at me, given it uses my character name multiple times.  Do you disagree?

So it was just coincidence that less than 5 minutes after we began talking in local, they discovered we were even in the chain. 
---
We weren't the original attackers, up until we talked in local (roughly 13 minutes after we showed ourselves to them for the first time, on the wormholes c5 static) they didn't even know we were there. 
---
Not sure how they were securing the fort from someone they hadn't even scouted yet.
---
I hope they didn't run the numbers and simply figure out that's the point (2 years) when the population of singularity would have trended downward enough for serenity population to surpass it.
---
At some point CCP could tell me they're starting a new shard and I'd be more excited than the patches meant to fix the economy on this one. At least than you wouldn't need to over-compensate for faucets and empires that had been running for years.
---
It's again one of those changes where you have to wonder if they even play their own game.
---
I particularly love that you can anchor a cyno jammer and a large T2 bubble right along side them. Lol
---
Stay hard Guard, o7

---
&gt;they unironically and actually encourage botting
---
I'm not entirely sure what retarded shit you've been coming up with but they don't exactly discourage it. Over there, they see RMT/bots, among other things, as perfectly acceptable.
---
No argument here! Glorious PVP death and mayhem is the goal! But affording that mayhem... That's the rub.
---
Literally the entire north is a raging dumpster fire :thinking:
---
Don't be sad it's over, be glad it happened o7
---
Talking about shit you know nothing about makes you look like a massive retard FYI
---
I second this!
---
Imagine unironically believing CCP own images like fatbee. Do your fucking research before you try to armchair lawyer tyvm
---
grrgoons wahh ccplz
---
Rental empires are the aids of Eve
---
Maybe t2 aeon would be a full ship?
---
Actually. When you submit a logo, ccp puts a texture over it. You agree they own the new version. You own the previous version.. 
---
I know as I have submited logos for 2 seprate allinces. 
---
Vastly outnumbered and VIAL
---
Let me guess the gate from period basis to Stain was the deciding factor!
---
They have 1.5 billion people. Someone can do math. Amazing. 🙄
---
 "goons dont rent they never have.. " what a load of bollocks.  I think you will find Goons had a big rental empire before the phoebe changes
---
Fatbee's really good with ESI!
---
I don't even remember past the first 3 letters of the system I staged in for the better half of a year.
---
They're really fixed on keeping everything ingame as their sole property though, so just having a licence to use what would then be ingame assets wouldn't make them very happy
---
StainGay
---
It was a fake scamming rental empire
---
To my knowledge or as far as I was told about 4 years ago, they are Public Domain so do what you like.
---
I mean it's a logo for an internet spaceship group.
---
I only used it as I used to love Eve and the logo :)
---
Why the fuck should CCP intervene in the sandbox to help it's lowest class citizens? 
---
Not only it sounds like a sure waste of Dev's time, but you should deal with the fact that noone gives a single fuck about renters.
---
&gt;goons have never ever rented
---
&gt;ccp need to make mechanics to prevent scamming
---
I can't tell if this is an incredibly dull and overworked form of bait or just you being an utter retard
---
Well I was for years, but then vacationed as the last few years have been pretty .....real life ish. Little time for games now.
---
Lady’s been working on her grammar.
---
You should grab all the ccp guys and just do a hodgepodge fleet of potatoes
---
We do.  The rental region is called Period Basis.
---
No, I was a goon for years.  
---
No time now.  
---
Just loved the logo.
---
how would it help botters? genuinely curious, i can't see how.
---
When did they send the application?
---
**You Really Think Someone Would Do That? Just Go On the Internet and Tell Lies?**
---
Well, like I said, it was on the open GF forum that it was okay for me to use them as they were public domain, so I certainly never saw it as stealing.
---
Needs more of [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vTmzNeJMkk)
---
They were securing the fort from the attackers you absolute mong... You and the OP state that the Fort was being attacked. So they probably waited out the timer until it was secure then came to you. I really would like to hear their side of things because you retards tend to overexagerate to make yourselves look better.
---
There's a reason you're collectively known as "Salty Dreams" too 😂
---
LOL we can be normal productive members of society too you know. :)
---
If people are so stupid to fall for it, they did not deserved their isk in the first place.
---
Botting/hacks are just a normal part of gaming to the chinese.  As normal and acceptable to them for example as a western player going online to look up a walkthrough or cheatcode.  Literally no difference to the chinese market.
---
Its endemic in every single game that has a large chinese population.  
---
Just look at the PUBG debacle. Blue hole released stats on hacker activity over millions of accounts and literally 90+% of it is from china.
---
So... legacy POS code?
---
Would be a major quality of life change if they let you import a list to gift the 1 month game times to.
---
I am guessing this is something for Texas law to hash out
---
are ypu a pretty fucking princess?
---
Yeah that's the bit, I remember now. So the goonie logo belongs to the goons. The CCP modified one belongs to CCP. So obviously this is the goon's issue to rectify.
---
Jump clones are a thing.
---
They already had, or did you forget to read the AAR?
---
They warped down well before the timer was secure :)
---
What if you are in a hostile station that will not allow you to enter a ship

I have friend in STK, but pls share anyway!

It was us the whole time.

I'll believe that when pigs grow wings tbh

&gt; noone gives a single fuck about renters.

I mean, those twats are usually some nice easy rorq kills

This reply certainly didn't.

Is there a way yet to change the camera rotation speed in-game, *without* changing any Windows mouse settings?

I mean, I know people love shitposts, but this is pretty bottom tier
---
One of my alts heads another character that pops up under "exact phrase only" because someone made a character with the same name but a ' added in the middle of the first name.
---
Goons actually have a section on their forums dedicated to these types of scams. It's full of mails and chat logs between the parties
---
put 4k in the title
---
Yeah, others aren't playing the way I like, so fuck the sand box and everyone in it.
---
the space whale, it is calling to me as i drift unseen.
---
Where is period basis?
---
He's probably busy. Sadus is in KF and scamming on KF characters is strictly prohibited.
---
All the way to the left or all the way to the right. (Sliders and options)
---
Is it? Never seen HS wh camp in like 2-3 month living in wh and actively rolling c2.
---
I really do not see how this data leads to your conclusion, can you please elaborate?
---
Once upon a time in 2004 I had two of those; one for perception, one for willpower. I fell asleep while piloting home in empire during a war. Lost my pod.
---
I am not sure where those originally came from but I bought 2 +7s and 2 +6s from the Yuali (spelling loss wrong) market for the exorbant rate of 120m per +7 and 110m per +6. Times were way simpler back then.

Yes.

Good bot.

&gt;To my knowledge or as far as I was told about 4 years ago, they are Public Domain so do what you like. I mean it's a logo for an internet spaceship group. I only used it as I used to love Eve and the logo :)

But know if it's used by a private compagny, it's not public anymore, is it?

These are probably the same people saying Brisc would be able to sue CCP successfully.

Hey thanks so much for the thoughtful reply. Totally not a wall of text. I had no idea about having to consider the market. I was thinking if I can mine it and build it, I can do anything and turn a profit. Didn't realize manufacturing is so specialized.
---
What I really was looking for was something fun and profitable to do PvE-wise with multi accounts for when pvp is hard to find. Ratting/mission running was terribly dull compared to real pvp that I have no stomach for it whatsoever. 
---
I wanted to be able to bring something to a Corp besides another f1 monkey that might also create pvp content (being bait) to ease the pve boredom when that sets in. I also was looking for a small network of my own alts to be self sufficient should I find a good system that I can take advantage of to the fullest. 
---
I will definitely aim to have a boost account/Orca pilot for a mobile refitting station, but the rest is really just something to do for pve that isn't boring and generates ISK... 
---
 I do love throwing monkey wrenches at people some times and had a blast ninja looting/salvaging people but idk how I could set up alts to do that profitably.
---
And? Don't leave us hanging -- is he a bee or an imposter?

I missed the whole resource wars thing so I was surprised when I couldn't find rocks in the belts where I live in null. I was even more surprised by the fact they were actually dangerous. Is solo mining a belt dead? I doubt I could kill the response fleet with a barge.

Fair point.

People often forget that the folks they are requesting things from in Eve are just people playing the game just like them.

Relax dude, he'll take care of you :)
---
I knew this was coming because ESI has ignored the "-" since launch, so while you are at it CCP please change ESI as well.
---
period basis is just southwest of stormwind
---
Not a scam, but pretty sure sadus email box exploded last week so give him time
---
What’s an ESS
---
You just need an alt or a friend to kill them. 
---
1. Get a ship with good dps/combat probes and a ship that is fast. I used a polarized hecate and an interceptor. Make sure they're not in fleet together.
---
2. Aggress the npc miners with the ceptor and they'll warp to a safe. Make sure you watch where they warp. Burn off as the response fleet comes.
---
3. You should have watched where they warped now just combat probe them down. As long as the ceptor stays on grid with the response fleet you'll be able to do whatever you want with the mining fleet
---
I think the better question is why can't I do this to my real bank account .-.
---
I’m currently pooping in a bucket using this to motivate me
---
This is the type of quality content that I can get behind
---
Hi, GSF diplomat here. Yes, we have a rental program as announced on the Meta Show. It is a legit program. Anyone rental scamming will be shot into the sun. Sadus is not scamming, he is the rental manager.
---
How dare you suggest that someone responsible for the recent renting out of space might be busy with other customers
---
24\~ hours of wormhole noise, next? It'd be hypnotic, and occasionally anxiety-inducing.

Get wardecced, lose a shuttle with 30b in plex to PIRAT on the perimeter gate.
---
Don't do that, the midslots on your logi ship are way to valuable.
---
I see you were only pretending to be retarded.
---
Leak or get off the pot. Make sure it is 100% un-redacted as well because from what I can remember you dont have clean hands on the edge Lord noncery front
---
You could not kill the defense fleet with any single ship aside from like a super probably. But if you aggro the defense fleet or gank their hauler and leave the belt they will warp to a safe. If you gank their hauler they will stay there iirc.
---
Matteral:  *Sort and Killah were seated next to Brisc and noticed his messages to Pando during meetings.*  
---
 Brisc and his main Fc get banned - NC deploys in a dry dock! 
---
 Fake space news enjoys a good story - honest csm members keep doing their things, obviously nothing happened in Eve yet again!
---
We only posted so much because hole control is just sitting on a hole but was alot of fun
---
And while they are at it, if I drag a player's name from the Corp chat box (or anywhere for that matter), you don't need to list every other variation of that name in the game for confirmation. I JUST LINKED THE CHARACTER!!!
---
I had alarms on my phone. I've had to walk my girlfriend through updating my skill queue when I was away.
---
As someone who enjoys intel gathering, this makes me happy.  =)
---
Well of course not, they botted it.
---
I hope this goes better than unspokens last deployment...
---
Absolutely great show.
---
Why doesn't Brisc just tell us all what hes in to.
---
You mean someone claims the ESS and it unanchors ALL the structures.
---
My corps app was processed in 2 days iirc. Just be patient and don't spam poke Sadus. He's very busy maintaining Delve intel
---
When will you start reporting it as "Panfam Winterco"?

Would actually be funny if the OP registers the Bee as their company logo then sues CCP/Goons to stop using it.

Since time immemorial the drake has had 6 hardpoints.  And I can't remember if it had a flat 25% or 5% per level but the net effect was to go from 25 to 20% at Vs.
---
gallente?   about beauty?  lol.  half their ships remind me of rotten fruits.  just look at the moros and tell me it doesn't remind you of a rotten fruit sinking into the bottom of its skin.
---
and amarr?  they about gold trim sure.  but beauty depends on the small details engraved in said trim.
---
It's still public.  For example, he can't trademark it, despite it being his company logo.
---
Pulses/beams are okay in small gang and the osprey navy is still really good normally. But laser platforms and missile platforms typically have larger downsides in general over the other weapon systems

How many people have asked about the bee? How many times did this turn into a multi hour discussion about eve online?
---
You'll get your skill points. They're just not allocated right now. It'll look like you're using a training booster. 
---
I also keep an eye in this site to see if anything comes up that looks interesting. Still not resubbed though. Since you are subbed still you might as well get the skills lock in place if nothing else.
---
I hope you find something that gets your interest. Good luck!  =)
---
sadus is probably too busy mining while on strat ops
---
Look up ggplot2. I believe that's what the cool kids use.
---
Graphics. There is absolutely no difference in races. Frankly, it feels quite pointless to even have any "back story". Sad really.
---
d3 looks cool, especially dynamic visualization... Wish I was better coder.

can you poke him? my friends are waiting :(

Make sure you bring your rain coats. This post contains bad weather.

Yeah I actually just noticed that 😂

no structures no wardecs

Doesn't excuse the harm you caused to uninvolved people
---
Sadus here - All requests received have been processed.   Some people seem to think 24 - 48 hour turn around is unreasonable.
---
Looks cool too. Bookmarked it.
---
Gonna try to learn it in free time.
---
F2p is just a trial account that doesn't expire.
---
AGREED! Coming back to the game after a few month hiatus and this is a change that makes absolutely no sense to me. It's so jarring that I am having trouble finding any of the systems I am used to.
---
I hate that I agree with you here. You're right though... Gallente ships look like bad French art drawings of rotten fruit... What about the Hyper... Oh I see it. The Brutix looks aggressive.
---
I love the clean symmetry and Beatle like designs in the Amarr ships. The Arbitrator reminds me of a creative take on federation ship design.
---
I'm not really into a specific platform, but something that I could check on the web/phone would be pretty cool.
---
Before the switch to ESI, there was a website/app that was easier to use and understand than evernus, it was called Eve Trade Master 2, there's a github here  [https://github.com/uplink42/etmv2](https://github.com/uplink42/etmv2) if it's any use for you, I would pay for something like that to come back.
---
I even though at giving it a shot but my programming skills are 12 years old and in the turbo pascal area.
---
it was a joke. sadus lost like 6 rorqs during a strat op. he is hyper autismo active so i doubt your post has any legitimacy
---
It happens - we pulled the tweet when we saw the very bottom of the article :)
---
I mean it could have been worse. The loan titan that decided to yolo in managed to extract and most of the other supers did. I had just cleared the bubbles when 5 more sabres landed on grid and well RIP Nyx. I was dropping my mobile Depots to by time knowing a new subcap support fleet was forming but we just didnt get the numbers in time for it to matter. Shit happens.
---
Yep I know, it's still funny.
---
I enjoyed data and relic exploration in wormholes with an astero for over a year before subbing. I recommend it for the on and off type of player. Logging on after a month of inactivity in some wormhole and having to figure out how to get back to amarr is also part of the fun.
---
I JUST WISH THE OMEN HULL HAD TWO ARMS ARGGGHHHHHH!!11
---
If you are the solo type and you abandon games so fast, yeah... you wont last long. This is a game of patience and it can take you years to master. You can go solo, yes, but it wont be easy. Normally one goes solo after some experience with groups and learning some basica, not easy though.
---
As has been said elsewhere, CCP “dirties” the file you send them and that’s what they copyright. CCP doesn’t own rights to the original.
---
Also, this wouldn’t be a copyright issue. It would be a trademark issue.
---
You should have heard the gates banging way back in the day :-).
---
I wish he'd release to pee tape already, I'm in need of new material.
---
The Amarr Battlecruisers??? Why? They have a durable, shell like feel to their look.
---
He better do it now, or its just a cry for attention.
---
Wait...what is this belt rat radio-chatter? I dont think I have ever heard it....
---
Or, and hear of out here, now pretending NOT to be retarded
---
Cosign.  u/CCP_Falcon please push this up the chain.  The Eve parlance for years has been 3-letter designations for null systems, and many/most null systems have a dash in those first three letters.  I couldn't tell you, gun to my head, the 4th character in O-V's system name, and I staged there for over a year.
---
I'm not adverse to joining a group if it makes the initial learning curve a bit less steep (albeit learning curve is not apt for EVE).
---
And I guess I wasn't being very clear, I don't "abandon" games per se; I just rotate it out for a different game on my list, and then come back to it after a bit.
---
RIGHT!? OR NONE. WHY WITH THE OFFSET RANDOM GROWTH??? WHAT'S WITH THAT?
---
I see so I'm basically stunted in terms of access to content in the game unless I sub?
---
No worries man, hope it shows you what you can run into and be prepared for but not put off! There's definitely money to be made in manufacturing, stocking up an alliances staging with doctrine ships/fits is a good way. T2 production can be very good but you need to invest more into skills (research/invention of BPO's and BPC's) and I personally haven't dipped into it at all so can't really give you much advice there.  
---
PI on 2 accounts with 6 characters can net you a lot of passive ISK income each month provided you've done your research on what planets you have available to you. Think every 48 hours is optimal for extraction/manufacturing cycles but if you're lazy like me when I did it, once a week is probably fine and low maintenance.  
---
An Orca is neat to be able to fly and you can use it yourself or be useful to other corp members. A really fun thing some people do is nomadic WH living using a cloaked Orca as a mobile base in shattered WH's - quite a tempting idea I've toyed with myself.  
---
Exploration would  be quite a good fit as a money maker inbetween pvp pings, its relatively easy to skill into/do. A Covops scanner is always a useful character to have for null or WH space for scanning down sigs/ships and  use as a cyno. Plus the additional benefit of then being able to fly stealth bombers for shenanigans!  
---
A dedicated subcap pilot is very handy and you can support it with another alt relatively quickly. Its something like 3 weeks to train into every racial Battlecruiser and weapon types to lvl 3 which will let you jump into most cheap t1 fits
---
I see. Did you do that solo or did you join a corp?
---
How did your F2P and Sub experience differ?
---
:joy:
---
Using an Expanded Probe Launcher and combat probes. The skilled hunter will d-scan you to an approximate position that might allow them to pinpoint you with 1 scan of the probes, which they then destroy rather than recall (so as to minimize the time you can see them on d-scan).
---
Your ship won't show up as a signature until they get an initial hit on you with the combat probes.  Combat scanning other players is different for the hunter than scanning signatures, because players move around, and players can also react if they notice the probes.
---
There are a few other ways they're finding you, too.  Depending on what exactly you're doing in the system, they may already have bookmarks at the locations you're visiting, so all they need to do is see you on dscan, pinpoint which bookmark you're at using dscan, and warp there.
---
Geee idk, how desperate are they?
---
yip
---
what kind off aar doesnt have the zkill/BR link :P
---
Dude should release it. He erased some pretty dank memes from the NSFW channel. I would like to see them again.

No. You have access to it. Your ability to do it is stunted.

---
This must be the best useless Eve infographic I've seen in a while, well done.
---
Nice little video! Idk if its just me but theres some flickers where theres nothing to see in between a couple transitions, im not sure what software was used, but may I recommend allowing them to overlap for a second, and then adding in a fade/in/out? May look a bit smoother in future ones.  
---
Looks like a fun brawl though! I love seeing all the other pvp going down you dont usually see/hear about! Keep it up NREM!
---
Do you just speed / sig tank away from them?
---
&gt; buying a person's retirement is part of buying the ship
---
Only for PVE boats. The crew on PVP ships all get killed eventually.
---
I was solo. Joined a Corp for 2% tax but didn’t need to. Subbed allowed for slightly better fit with slightly better performance in scanning and navigation, and considerable gains in hacking with tech II data/relic analyzers plus the gains from training respective skills to lvl 5 to use those analyzers. Failing rarely happens now. 
---
I’d say I went 80% to 98% efficiency for wh exploration in the astero.
---
So only leadership is allowed to scam people from rentals?
---
Sure it will close to INIT. They think they can win because of the bann of Pando and Shines.

This is good spot to hunt for xp then?

If your account lapses into alpha state and you can no longer sit in your ship, you can still log in sitting in it and nothing world-ending happens.

I get it that you like the bee logos (so do I), but maybe get a local artist to do something _based on that general look and feel_. Pay them for their work, get an assignment of copyright, get a trademark. Then you own it.

I played a lot of Overwatch and Destiny 2 and I'm enjoying Eve very much. I really like Exploration a lot. It's a very unique game. I had an alpha account for maybe the first month. I joined a corp on my second day, and its been great since then. The corp gave me a bit of ISK, a ship or two to get started, and added me on discord to get me a bunch of sites that help explain a lot of newbie questions.
---
I'm having a lot of fun. It provides a lot of player freedom and options for being interested in a bunch of stuff, which are things I didn't like about Destiny. I think that the power level mechanic in Destiny is what bothered me most.
---
There's literally no reason not to try an alpha account. Its not that much different than omega minus being able to train skills and pilot ships. But even so, you wouldn't be able to fly many of the ships without training for a while and making enough ISK for it to be worth it for you.

Can you give an example of what you would consider targeted harassment to be then?

It still has Tri as part of TRUMPY, but didn't LUMPY fold into skill urself a while ago?

I look forward to the explanation, assuming you actually are going to give it instead of playing word games.

Unsure about that, but it's quite outdated yes

Yeah, I just do a drive by point with the ceptor on one of the mining ships and keep it burning away

Maybe, just maybe, and stick with me here because it gets a bit complicated, but maybe we're practically giving away rental space not because we need the money, but because we want to disincentive groups from renting from anyone but us.
---
Mind. Blown.

Anchoring them in NS anoms is really not a big deal, and provided they can't be anchored on a POS (which seems aids) then they're a great source of content tbh

The problem wasn't solved last time.

So yes, I'm asking again.

" I know EVE went F2P a while back, and the sub model was always holding me back from playing it (I know sub makes sense for a lot of people, but I tend to steer clear from those games). "

You lost me almost instantly. Go play minecraft.

You can still do basically anything. Your ability to do the difficult parts *well* is another matter entirely.

---
Fantastic answer, I appreciate the time you took to read and type out a response.
---
This makes me feel less cautious about giving EVE a chance; because most of the answers I've read are for the most part "Go away newbros if you aren't ready to put in all your free time and years of playing"
---
4k? 40k or nothing.

you really included the Germans? lol that's amazing

You guys need to have someone do spelling and grammar checks. I see one or two mistakes in each dev blog or news article and it just doesn't look good.

---
Best thing to do starting out if you are looking to exponentiate your isk making is to reinvest profits to injectors to facilitate more isk making. Bonus if the thing you do is scaleable!
---
It’s reccomendable. You can do exploration easily as solo, for the fun of it, as well as seightseeing while you earn a bit of isk. 
---
Being Alpha isnt gamebreakingly limited, you can go shoot at people and play the markets just as Omega players can. You can even get into scamming people ingame if that’s your thing.
---
Primary thing omegas get is no restrictions on ships and fits.
---
I just read that article and I think literally the entire thing is an ad for the RMT website they mentioned.
---
I've frequently helped newbies who are trying to finish this mission, and typically I'll just fleet up with them and warp to them with my Kronos (T2 battleship).  I'm not really sure what the upper bound for what kinds of ships can get into that pocket is, but most stuff should definitely be able to.
---
The thing to keep in mind is that there's a LOT of travel involved in the SOE Epic Arc, so you wouldn't want to do it all in a big ship anyways.
---
Yep that was my thoughts as well.
---
Interesting username.

This isn't a tech support group. If you don't want to submit a support ticket you could try asking on the [forum](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/issues-workarounds-localization/general-issues).

This isnt a game about the ships you fly. It's about the people you fly with. It is a social game at it's core, playing solo shoots you in the foot. If you try, join a corp and find a community that fits well with your likes and dislikes.

goon leadership already have the tools to bilk unsuspecting players out of huge amounts of isk via taxes &amp; fees

Its an inside joke.

Good luck buying even a Cruiser for 10 mil...

too late! :D
---
I mean you can get the hull for that, maybe...
---
4k a second with an AB!?!=!
---
Assuming you are using the free version, what is the upside of Slack compared to e.g. Discord that makes up for having basically no scrollback?
---
Staingate isnt a bad 10mil BS idea
---
I play solo, I ha e joined Corps and learned a lot, but in the end , the corps go silent and I end up solo.  The huge mega Corps weren't my thing.  I play a few months, quit for a few, then go back.  Do I get rich? No, but I do t care, for me it is a way to pass time.  Am I omega? Yes, 2 accounts, 2 alts that work together.  That makes it enjoyable for me and keeps me busy.
---
There are plenty of groups out there that will teach you the ropes and are friendly to casual players that drop in and out. Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Brand Newbros and Karmafleet are the main ones in null-security space if you're interested in PVP, and I'm told that Eve University is highly regarded too.
---
I personally would prefer discord, and am in the discord server myself; however, slack is a place you generally can access while at work as well. There is a limit on file uploads and whatnot, I believe slack actually removes files periodically once the slate is full. Scrollback I'm not sure of.  
---
This slack isn't meant to be a replacement for the discord server, just an alternative slack for the slack that's already out there. So if you don't already use slack or have no interest in it, it might not be for you.
---
Is that how you interpret it?  Honestly.
---
Why?
---
You seem like the type of player I am (minus the paid sub).
---
Do you enjoy your playtime though (regardless of omega or not)?
---
One that is made for you by a friend or Corp mate that you can convince them.
---
I'm not too interested in PvP although I am sure I will have to get into it sooner than later if I play.
---
I've heard that new players get hunted down fairly frequently.
---
Battleship hulls start at 120 million and that's a deal. A fully fitted and insured one is gonna be pushing 200 million.
---
Got it. Thanks for your reply !
---
Hopefully you can "weather" the storm of negative feedback
---
By battleship I just mean anything that is meant for fighting
---
So you're going to reply that it's all sorted/processed now, are you?
---
I do, it is challenging.  You need good spreadsheets to keep track of it all.  I've been at it off and on si ce 2012.
---
My grumble with some ships isn’t asymmetry but *imbalance*. 
---
Take two Gallente frigates, the Atron and the Imicus. Neither is symmetrical, but the Atron feels more balanced to me - I could believe that the thrust from the engines lines up with a reasonable center of mass. The Imicus, not so much. 
---
Update the Imicus to a vertical main body with a spindly sensor boom sticking out the side, and I’d be happier with it. That “old man leaning on a cane” look is not pleasing to me. 
---
Asymmetry is okay, and can look functional (see Kestrel, Manticore, Raven), but imbalance bugs me.
---
That seems to be the overwhelming opinion here; it's not that I only play solo, and I am certainly not adverse to joining a group, it's just for me over the years I've had to learn to play by myself since my friends have all but stopped gaming.
---
Back in the day it used to be 100 rifters.
---
If you have 10 mil in your pocket I would recommend fitting up 5 t1 frigates with meta modules and losing them in fun ways, because that's about all 10 mil is going to get you.
---
Or you can give *me* the ten mil, and I'll give you 20 mil back.
---
If you have time please study the relationship between price and value. Although you may be able to nab some of your competitor's customers initially, these customers will not be retained in the long run. The perception of the price is just as important as the price. Often time when consumers quickly grab the cheapest option, they are left with post purchase regret as they realize the price was low for a reason. Because of this, many consumers are willing to pay a higher price because they want a service that will keep providing value and satisfaction in the long run.
---
*mouthbreathing intensifies*
---
 You mentioned mining you should know the vast majority of industry activities are kept behind Omega as Alpha you only get access to the smallest mining ship.
---
 However you can still experience quite a bit of the game it's just you'll sense your limitations,you will experience loses and it'll be hard to recover
---
I guess I was the only person in the game that as a new player constantly switched characters on my one account.
---
Shut the fuck up krab
---
Free accounts can access all ships except capitals and the more powerful t2 and t3 ships. T2 and t3 are undisputedly more powerful and/or specialized than the t1s youd be restricted to, but dont think that all the omega characters just roam around in t3 ships slaughtering free players by the dozen or anything. Every ship has its place, and even veteran players often fly t1 ships because the cost effectiveness is usually better. Even the largest alliances in the game still have t1 doctrines they use.
---
Skill training is also restricted. Some skills will be limited in what level you can train them to, and many will be barred from you completely. The barred ones are only for ships, weapons, and modules that free players cant use anyway, so if anything it only keeps you from accidentally wasting training time. The level restrictions will certainly keep you from being a perfect ship pilot, but they aren't so low as to cripple you. 
---
Beyond the ship and skill limits, nothing about the game is explicitly barred to free players. Theres no "upgrade to omega to access this feature" popups, nothing is unreasonably hard to get into for free vs paid players, beyond taking twice as long to train any relevant skills to do it.
---
The only thing I dont like about how the f2p vs omega split is framed by ccp is that it's a but disingenuous to call omega training 2x speed, when in reality it's more like f2p is half speed since Omega speed is the same as it was before f2p was introduced. But, marketing teams gotta market I suppose.
---
its ok. in eve, pvp is interested in you xD
---
Alright seeing as you actually meant COMBAT ship... the follow up question is what are you looking to do, PVP or PVE?
---
translator notes: battleship = battle worthy ship
---
Battleships will always cost more than that, hell a decent fit battleship will be closer to 200-300 mil. If you want a cheap cruiser that’s closer to your price range, you could try a vexor. They’re good for both pvp and pve, I go neuts and armor buffer for pvp brawling. You might have to t1 fit it, or go down one more to a destroyer.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Definitely clears a lot of things up haha.
---
I guess I may have to give EVE a chance at the very least, and see if I'm enjoying it enough to consider keep playing it or not.
---
Also agreed, marketing has to market stuff so 2x is better than saying F2P is .5x
---
How dafuq are you "destroying" probes?
---
TEXA SLAW
---
Got it. This is definitely good information to have. Appreciate it !
---
PVP is something that you have to prepare for in Eve, regardless of whether you plan to fight or not. When you undock a ship, it's best to consider it lost already, and it's a bonus if it happens to make it back home intact. The most common piece of advice in this game is to only fly what you can afford to replace.
---
I wouldn't say that new players get targeted specifically, but a lot of people quit because they get ganked in high-security space, which is meant to be "safe" because NPC police will show up and kill players who attack others. However, the police will only avenge you - they take a few seconds to appear, and that's more than enough time for someone to kill you.
---
If you're a genuinely new player, people might message you after killing your ship and give you some tips on how to not die so easily next time. Most people want newbies to thrive and toughen up rather than dropping the game because they lost an expensive ship.
---
Doing PVE in this game requires a healthy dose of paranoia. You're not likely to get ganked if you're mining in a Venture (the only mining ship accessible to alphas) in high-sec, but you're not going to get much profit doing that compared to something like exploration or ratting in null-sec.
---
Obviously, this kind of approach to PVP doesn't appeal to everyone, and that's fine - Eve is a niche game, being what I belive is the only remaining MMO with hardcore loss mechanics.
---
I can’t think of a cruiser that costs less than 10m, and I’ll assume the average BS is at least five times that.
---
If you just want to derp around and mine, then sure try it out, but I doubt you'll have much fun.
---
The real EVE begins when you start to PVP. This can be done as an alpha (f2p) but ought to be done in a Corp. The learning curve is very high, especially solo, and your corpies will bring you up to speed much faster.
---
What in the actual fuck are you talking about? 
---
This isn't a pair of jeans. Rental space is rental space. The only difference is the quality of the landlord, and quite frankly Goons could take a shit on our renters doorstep every day and still be better at it than our competitors who refuse to even pretend to defend their renters space.
---
Oh no, I'm living in a 5 bedroom McMansion in a gated community for less money than I was paying for a studio apartment above a crack house. I have such regret.
---
They just showed us how salty they are about getting bashed around by a irrelevant NPSI group.
---
Please no weekly posts.
---
You can get Vexor hulls for 7.5-9m but the fittings and insurance is gonna put you to at least 17-20m.
---
i can give you a shorter one, looped for 24 hr :P. im making a series of 5 min long ones right now for WH show.
---
Say *warship* then; a Battleship is an actual ship class, and you won’t find under at least 40m.
---
STOP IT. 
---
I AM NOT RE-INSTALLING.

GOD DAMN YOU.

this is good content, did you make it? thanks
---
For the blood god
---
I can do bi-weekly if it makes your feels better
---
Ok
---
Can I trust you though?
---
For 10 mil you're going to be in the frig/destroyer range bc of fitting costs. Here are my suggested options per race... 
---
Amarr: Coercer, Tormentor.
---
Caldari: Cormorant, Merlin. 
---
Gallente: Algos, Tristan.
---
Minmatar: Thrasher, Breacher
---
Figure out what hull you prefer (they all have different strengths) and ask for fitting advice on that hull. There is no one answer.
---
PVE definitely
---
Fair enough, but the Vector is mass-produced got its usefulness, it’s probably an exception.
---
I've definitely begun to be more frugal. I ask myself often, "neat I can buy a new ship, buy is it going to be cancer to move it later?"
---
What the hell CCP, what are you even paying your community team for?
---
Oh yeah...
---
Yeah just saw the thread about the sentient sebo price spike, had to be expected. In fact its a bigger nerf to carriers than to supers, as in a carrier you HAVE to lock those damn frigs
---
Ok thanks
---
Why don't you just join the existing unofficial EVE discord and share your "crude jokes" there?
---
thanks!
---
I dont think you fully understand, but its ok, its actually flip flopped of what you think. Go to zkill and look at Delve "Most Valuable Kills - Last 7 Days" then look at Tribute "Most Valuable Kills - Last 7 Days", and tell me the difference you see
---
As stated in a previous post in this thread, I spend most of my time on here at work when on breaks here. I don't have much time at home to do the same, and work blocks discord. So I can't really do that :)
---
It's probably tied up in POS code or something insane like that.
---
I 100% agree with you on this. 
---
The argument I'll get is that the lack of resistance nulls the need for balanced thrust, the feel and perception of the player for the ship is what Elite Dangerous does right. Though the constant wedge design gets boring. 
---
Story, mechanics and theme are the only reason I think Gallente and Amarr ships should be symmetrical hulks.
---
If you really start getting into eve, you can get omega status by buying PLEX in-game instead of shelling out cash for it. If you're doing a good job of making isk in the game, it's way to save real money while trying and deciding if omega is worth it to you. 
---
However, as ongoing subscription method, PLEXing generally sucks. You dont want to spend half or more of your game time grinding isk just so you can keep omega to keep grinding isk to keep omega to... The game is much more enjoyable if you just shell out the $15/mo (or as low as $10/mo for longer subscription plans) and actually enjoy your time playing in game. Unless, of course, you're really taking it in and the cost of PLEXing is nothing for you, but it usually takes a while for most people to get that level of income
---
worth noting that 1v1 fights anywhere are few and far between. you def have more chances in fw to get those fights but in general no fight is fair. 
---
for t1 stuff try the incrusis, tristan, punisher, breecher are all fun. but really any t1 frig. its fun to play with fits. and then the fed navy comet has historically been an amazing fw boat.
---
Caldari, Minmatar, Gallante or Amarr?
---
Delve has 100 times more people?
---
Not atm, but I am watching some weird stuff inside the chinese groups, i am not fully sure what is going on but something points to them wanting to distract the rest of eve about who is affiliated with who in the chinese player group. One part of this scheme is Infinity Avenger doing chinese NPSI Fleets with hilarious compositions (chinese Goons, FRT &amp; Winterco, Panfam chars idk if chinese and others showing how much they infiltrated already).
---
Watch suitonia's vids on YouTube, the channel is called "eve is easy" . The videos are a bit outdated in some aspects but the tutorials are very good, very well explained including fits, tactics and etc. I learned a lot from them about lowsec and nullsec solo pvp
---
Absolutely. I'm a trustworthy Goon. 
---
In all seriousness though, if you really do only have 10 mil to your name message me in-game and I really will  just give you a bunch of ISK just for asking such a cute newbie question.
---

They just haven’t been touched in a long time. The textures are low resolution and models lack detail. They also have lackluster skin collection probably related to the outdated models and textures.

---
Good point.
---
Why is there a button over the punchline of your post
---
Cause I couldn't make it go away.
---
no.
---
It would cause far too many problems. Insta-warp Interceptors would be damn near impossible to catch with the pilot not having to press a button. The whole reason nobodoy uses it is *because* of the fact you land off the gate.
---
Well if I remember the next step up is a cruiser and so you could go with a caracal. That is a good pve missile boat from what I remember. Moa would be pretty good seeing as you are using hybrids
---
Any particular reason why not?
---
You should be able to run like 5 clients on max graphics, eve is not very demanding as already said.
---
Mmmm, hell no!
---
The idea is if you afk and use autopilot you can be ganked for being a lazy shitter.
---
lol neither region is being rented, how about we compare period basis to the spire instead?

Ok thx

Then maybe use a browser or quickly photoshop it in paint or use a PC or...
---
Shit tier post dude
---
 
---
&gt;Or should I just give EVE a chance because it's F2P and the only thing that it'll cost me now is maybe 2 hours of download time and a few wasted days if I'm not into it?
---
Honestly, am sorry but I think Eve is just not for you.
---
You can't completely avoid PvP in Eve, even if you stay neutral and never join any corps. If you join a wrong corp, you will have no choice but to PvP. 
---
Alpha, Eve's F2P thing, sucks major ass. its not like otehr F2P games, it is extremely limiting, you don't even get half of shit available to you as omega. it severly limits content you can do, and more importantly, **how** you do it. It just lacks quality of play. For example you see these "well am an alpha newbie doing explo ..." they can't even use a cloak or fly a covert ops, not to mention a T3C, but cloaking is the gigantic one.
---
Next you have severe, and I do mean severe skillpoint limitations. 1st off you can train only up to 5 mil Skillpoints. That won't even cover this  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)  which is what you need for good basics for everything else. Sure, you can inject alpha injectors up to 20 mil, but again, only 1 a day and alpha injectors give you very little SP, so you are looking at too much time. And even at 20 mil, depends on what you choose as your main ship you still won't have enough to cover a decent variety of fits for your ship, and those level 5 skills do add up. They make a big and noticable difference.
---
So alpha is more or less like a "demo" a never expiring and with extended functions demo, but still just a demo.

I wanted to say Kinakka Thunderdome 4.0 but it's not technically in Kinakka so that bummed me out.
---
Keep in mind that a ship that is good for PVE will generally be terrible at PVP, and vice-versa. For PVE, you have to know what type of activity you plan to do first before you want to purchase and fit a ship, because each ship has different strengths and weaknesses that you want to min/max, and a lot of ships - especially when you start getting into the tech II ships - are specialized for a specific role. Are you just killing rats in belts, running missions, scanning for anomalies, doing exploration, salvaging after other ratters etc? All of these activities will require a different ship to complete efficiently.
---
buddy what kind of weed are you smoking?

That will be more than enough

knowtechie is a joke.

There is the dc meet up monthly
---
This post has been on my mind all day. I'm going to plex my main, and I'll run combat sites to earn isk. Is that viable? What ship should I aim for? I'm more interested in a non-afk setup, since I'll actively 'play' with this char.
---
All the kinds its legal in canada budz
---
You fuckers made it sound like he fucken *died*
---
 I functioned on PLEX for as any as 4 accounts for about 10 years now and I gota tell you I never ran out of isk to plex or isk for ships. For your example with 4 characters I would've kept only 2 adapted one to be a carrier pilot and rated my face off while carrier anom running was a thing keep the other for whatever.
---
  My point is you always want a strong isk farming character if you want to be on PLEX only be it a well trained anom ratter,DED runner,trader,mission runner,abyss runner,suicide ganker there's prob few more that can bring bilions upon bilions in relatively short time.Mining is definitely not it
---
There are a shit-ton more active players in Delve are making a shit-ton more income than in Tribute?

I want you to apologize to this dictionary for slander
---
Naw he should play and see if it works it’s cheep to omega and you can get 1000s of hours out of alpha before making the jump.
---
I won’t lie to you, I’ve put in quite a few hours. But one of the best parts about Eve is that training the skills you need to fly ships or use certain modules is always running in the background. Even when you’re not online. So even if you don’t play for a week, you may have finished a few skills that let you pilot a new ship to try a new aspect of gameplay. 
---
I started off mining, then while making some ISK mining, trained the skills for explo, then did the same training to get my mining barges (after I went omega). So there’s constantly this feeling of at least getting closer to some goal you have.
---
A few tips: don’t fly anything out of a station that you can’t pay for at least 5 times over. If it costs you more than 1/5th your total isk it’s not worth the risk. A k a don’t fly what you can’t afford to lose. You will die. You will lose ships. Fact.

Professional curiosity, how much interest has there been so far? Assuming that information is not sensative.

I only have 2 accounts and just pay for them with a sub, it’s not a lot of money where I’m from, barely more than the hourly minimum wage.

the rifter is most definitely a ship that battles

A few and a couple have turned into long conversations.

The more comical though would be the local kebab shop owner who wanted to know if I "Made the honeys"
---
Or the lady who ran up to me in a panic to tell me she had 3 bumble bees living in her porch and could I more them.

I reported this multiple times and was asked to open a bug report in game.

GMs say this was not intended so it’s definitely a bug.

i believe the starving leshaks are the more dangerous because 8 of them can spawn in with webbers included.

All it would come down to would be no one but the CEO being able to do it. Trust has almost nothing to do with it, because the roles/rights system is just plain crap ever since I can remember. No matter how much you trust someone there are just some things you don't want everyone to be able to do.

You can test abyssal space on SiSi. I was doing just that an hour ago. You have to grind for filaments though.

Gotta be sure the devs are aware of the issue before it's reasonable to expect a fix, right?
---
I mean most likely, but like some places are gonna have CEO's or other directors running around collecting the loot for there line members, while some places won't. 
---
Now the trick is to create a ton of these tasks forcing leadership to specialize or become some massive that everyone and there dog has a spy in there leadership. 
---
Like the whole generalization of nullsec is kinda why it's so stale and boring because right now is there really a difference in joining NC or Goons or Test, like all the groups seem well very much the same from the line members perspective.

You can earn a lot of money playing this game: You can sell in-game items or currencies in an online marketplace like redated. However, keep in mind, this goes against the game’s terms of service and if you’re caught, you’ll immediately be banned from the game. 
---
Yeah I'm not really sure why even an article would put that in there I guess they really wanted 7 for some reason.

I figured it was just me being stupid.

I refused to believe a game that's over 15 years old had no camera sensitivity option.

that was the most work ive seen someone put into getting good camera shots, too bad you omitted all the info that lets the user see that something is happening.

A good way to reduce the grind is gas cloud harvesting in wormholes, with the venture imo. Then sub when you're  ready

Give it a shot, but don't try it without friends. The best ship you can fly is friendship. Find a corp and get on comms! You'll have a blast.

I haven't died yet, but the closest couple of times have both been due to Karybdis and lots of webbing sleepers. Not being able to get transversal up on the Karybdis really really hurts.

You can definitely play eve as f2p and have a ton of fun but you do need to join a corp. Eve was not meant to be played solo.
---
Find a casual but active Corp, most of them won't mind even if you go inactive for a couple of months.
---
Here is the post from the last one. Checkout the discord it is pretty active. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b5hqrk/dcvamd\_eve\_meetup\_saturday\_30th\_march\_2019\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b5hqrk/dcvamd_eve_meetup_saturday_30th_march_2019_at/)

That honey comment reminds me of an email my mushroom farm "Rabbit Hole Farms" got from China.  "I too love rabbits, we well many high quality cages and slaughter supplies.  Contact us at..."
---
First off, most people are right about corps. You will be doing your self a disservice by not being in a corp. I recommend Horde, Test, Goons, Brave and Eve Uni. These are all new bro alliances that don't care if you are alpha or omega.
---
You can play on Alpha and grind your way to omega in game, it is about 70 hours mining as an alpha. Then about 20 hours a month to keep your self omga. Or it is one hour at a minimum wage job, which is why most people sub one account and if they have multiple accounts they sub using the in-game currency.
---
Formup at the waffle keepstar?
---
24 hours of rorqual cycling please
---
Because without local, players will be just as vulnerable as bots.  The difference is that bots go at it for 24/7 so losses mean nothing.
---
Resouce Wars is a failed attempt to get people to work together.  It's not connected to the NPC miners. These spawn if a NPC mining corp has settled the system. And the only way to stop them is to shoot them. (quite dangerous) There was a topic a while ago about what to shoot to delay them the longest but I can't find it right now.
---
Did they get kicked out of Delve?
---
Ugh....I rather .01 station trade in Jita lol. But interesting nonetheless. I wonder if there is any recordings on youtube with it. Thanks.

Never and glad I didnt have to lol.

---
I tried t5's several times on the test server with gila + pod for 10b ISK.
---
Time was my biggest enemy, was pretty much every time the reason i would die in there, if were to die in there.
---
But granted, i was spared from the real hell spawns in my test runs.
---
Tried a few other ships and fits (Cerberus; Sacrilege) and my death ratio would be even higher with them.
---
The risk is real and the reward wasn't good enough for me regarding that much risk.
---
And since i cannot afford to loose these ships, fits and pods, i just don't fly them at all as the golden rule says.
---
Therefore i decided to not touch t5 filaments on the live server and stick with t4's.
---
even Ncsoft did it with lineage 2!
---
use cheap dispendable ships like rifters, breachers,tristans,merlin(armor merlin is bae) kestrel with dual MASB , destroyers, or even assault frigs, i learned to kite in a nano wolf
---
And mining is barely doing anything at all.  Its fine to run while watching a movie or doing something else, but its hardly gaming.
---
Ooh!  I'd cross-advertise this to the local NPSI group there, Redemption Road.  Ping @Greygal_Eve on Twitter, you may find that they'd be willing to assist with form-up and bodies if they're not already.

Last one we fed to eagles through a low-low wormhole. The one before that we fed some at the start of fleet and then lost almost our entire comet fleet shooting brave as they kept coming back and upshipping. We're totally good to lose shit and have simple fun when it's time for that, strat ops and serious business time are their own thing. 
---
In all cases Waffles emphasizes having a brain and sometimes that means knowing when you when not to take a fight or how to get the one you do want. You seem like you're rustled that we didn't feed to you on some occasion.

When ECMing someone they can still target you. How does that change when there are multiple ECM ships all targeting the same ship? Can he target all ECMers or no one?

Also, how does this affect ECM drones? Why aren't they more popular because I imagine blinding people is really powerful?

Dear Lord please...
---
Range control. Work within at you optimum range and hopefully your opponent doesn't share the same optimum range because then it turns into a dps race.
---
If you are brawl fit. Get in close on kiters.
---
If you are kite fit keep your distance from brawlers.
---
Don't expect a fair fight.
---
You will lose ships.
---
From my own experiance, I lost about 15 t1 frigates trying to solo other t1 frigates before kiting a catalyst dead solo. In 1v1 t1 frig fights I now generally get killed a little less than twice for each solo kill after about 50 attempts.
---
As silly as it sounds, pve some to learn module control, targeting and positioning.  I found it took me 4 or 5 seconds to target and activate modules because I never learned how to properly. Also, know how far one pulse from a mwd or ab will move your ship. When you need to create or close a gap with your target this is useful. 
---
Even better find someone to 1v1 and try different fits and ships. You can just go to hull if you don't want to lose the ship. After each fight figure out why you won or lost. Was it your fit, your opponent's fit, piloting, proper or improper module activation....?
---
Just keep at it. If you are learning, you are getting better.
---
My first fucking thought too.
---
EVE has a lot of rock-paper-scissor mechanics. I.e. a fast blaster-fit frigate at close-range will apply damage really, really well to a slower cruiser, but that cruiser, if fitted with big artillery guns, won't be able to apply damage to the speedy-frigate.  Similarly, a non-moving target at long range will get hosed by that same arty-fit cruiser.   
---
Thus, winning fights often boils down to figuring out if your opponent is a rock, paper, or scissors, while at the same time fitting your ship with flexibility - i.e. you look like paper, but you can also be very rock-like if you need to. 
---
Good PvPers pick fights they can win, and will bail-out of most fights.   
---
Here's the excessive details about damage application:

---
 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile\_mechanics](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missile_mechanics)
---
As far as I know, you can always target the things that are successfully jamming you, otherwise 2 jams from different ships and you won't be able to target anything.
---
ECM drones are the same, you can only target the ECM drone(s) that are successfully jamming you. That's how you can get away in a 1v1 scenario. They are by far the most popular utility drones out there, but sometimes DPS is just simpler.
---
BloobidabloobiddabloobidaWHACK!

There is no "good at pvp" in eve. Only "good at choosing when and when not to pvp".
---

I'm happy I did. Well not chaining, but killing chains so faction and officer spawns occurred more often. Boy did that piss off krabs back in the day. "IVE BEEN CHAINING FOR HOURS AND YOU FUCKED IT UP!!!?!?!"
---
I've never died. But my close calls were usually caused by greed and complacency.
---
He may be decent, he may be busy, but this is eve. How is anyone supposed to know what is a scam or legit?
---
I believe they changed that sound because the gate campers went nuts from the constant banging of some high-traffic gates :-).
---
If you have to ask if you're a good fit, then no.
---
That’s true I guess , however I’m but hurt because I still wanna know where NC are deploying
---
Ohhhh, ok.
---
C'mon man, dont go out like this.
---
Classic. I'm feeling my age.
---
Every ship has some standard fits, every fit has a engagement profile. You basicly learn what your engagement profile is and then look for matchups that work in your favour. All the module management, range control, heat management etc comes with practice.
---
The second part is finding fights which is an art in itself, that requires region knowledge, practice with stuff like dscan, navigation with dotlan/eveeye/ingame map. 
---
Eventually you will get comfortable with your ships and the standard rock/paper/scissor matchups like you find them in FW, then the fun begins and you can go out of the box with your own fits to counter certain ships you see in the wild or focus more on piloting with kiting ships, another entirely different skill.
---
Just enjoy the shakes and don't get discuraged when you get blobbed for the 20th time.

This is often done as sponsored content. Shady sites pay smaller tech outlets to write a subtle article to increase search engine relevance so they appear higher in Google page rankings. Jim sterling did a bit on this regarding loot ox gambling sites a while back.

Faction Warfare is a great place to start messing around with pvp. I started about 5 days ago with it. Been playing for 6 years. Never really got big into pvp until recently.

I'm in this same position as you with the same timeframes and everything. Today I woke up with a new plan, since I've never really concentrated on PVP but I have all the game mechanics understood, it's a matter of just jumping in and doing it.  So my plan is to build a bunch of cheap ships and go out to low-sec looking for fights and engage the first thing I see, knowing I'll probably lose the ship.  The important part is I'm recording video to study later what happened and why I lost and how to counter it in the future.
---
I built four Incursus' today (with [this fit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/33420293/)) and went out and tried blapping a cyno ship, but it was a badger with good tank so I gave up after a few minutes hehe
---
Not the game for you.
---
Oh no! He's retarded !
---
It's quite a common fit in faction warfare these days. You do dual webs in the mids to give some more control and go DCU + saar in the lows.

I mean your actual alliancemate atually cheated, something you apparently forgot about in your haste to jump on the bandwaggon

One thing people often miss is that you can double click in space to set your ship going in a certain direction. There is also first person camera mode that uses the arrow keys (?) to fly your ship around, but I'm garbage at doing that and it limits your view of what is going on around you in space.
---
I would recommend joining eve-university to learn about how to play the game. That's what I did 8 years ago, and it was a good time. I hung around for a couple months and then went off to do my own thing in low/null sec. Some people also say you should join the null sec empire newbie corps (karmafleet, pandemic horde, brave newbies) and I'm sure that would be fun too.
---
Also convo the killer don't wait for them to get in touch with you! Most people will be willing to talk you through the fight and share tips even after they have popped you. You do get the occasional snowflake who won't be helpful but meh nothing ventured, nothing gained.
---
Also to add you need to recap each of your fights in your head and work out what went well and what went bad etc. Did you notice that the enemy's DPS dropped when you were a bit further from their ship as opposed to being right up close? There's a learning point there about range control!!!
---
I always recommend new players join the corp **EVE University**. They can teach you all about the game.
---
I agree the control scheme is a little different. Our character is supposed to be in complete control of the ship. But our player control is more like the captain giving orders to his bridge crew. Telling the navigator where to go, and they do the actual driving. Telling the Gunner who to shoot, and they pull the trigger.

---
To what INIT, they already lost everything.
---
One way to save time is to carry a Mobile Tractor Unit, and 5x Salvage drones. Drop the MTU early on, and it will gather up the wrecks and loot. Then you can set the drones loose towards the end. Press F without targeting a wreck and they will start "aggressively" going after any legal wrecks in range. So they'll basically just swarm around the MTU and clean up.
---
But yeah, High Sec is "safer" but not quite as profitable.

The north is a raging dumpster fire of twats, INIT is a shitty mess of incompetence
---
If you double click in space your ship will move in that direction. By doing this in quick succession you can create movements of your ship that is far more under your control than the normal movement commands.
---
You can also turn on the tactical overlay and hold Q (approach) to draw a line to a point in space which your ship will then move towards.
---
These two things make up the basics of manual piloting your ship, a skill that will save your butt if you are flying tackle or need to get out because your FC got tackled and warped you to safety but now you need to scoot that boot.
---
Also, if you have the tactical overlay on, you can fly to a specific point in space by holding q and clicking once to set range and a second time to set angle.
---
Isn't that all NPSI fleets? Go out to null, watch all the scrubs dock up because they won't fight, then return to Lowsec? Or, go to Goon space to get Boson'd on a gate.
---
Yea that description of how the ship moves is exactly what it feels like. I was doing the intro agency quests and it was annoying to try and sort through the target list to find the hostiles then lock on to as many as I can then start to try and keep them in my optimum range to return fire. I'll try and find the EVE university Corp next time I log on. Tyvm!
---
What PvE are you doing for isk?

Tyvm for the links I think for now I'm going to stick with exploring until I can get a better handle of combat and fitting actual ships i only have what the intro agency stuff gives you and i have no idea if any of those ships are even decent

ITS more a factor if me not being able to push updates since eve-files changed/died. I tried getting in contact with chribbax but I can try again. Unfortunately it is kinda difficult to get in contact with prople spanning the globe so its a slow process. Coalitionsin.space is a more accurate and API support backend that I am able to update though
---
I think I wasnt using the double click correctly because it seems like it's more for the tactical map instead of being close on your ship. Because when I use it zoomed in I feel like I get the depth wrong, like I hope to far out or not far enough
---
Oh as a follow up, find yourself a quiet corner of highsec to run sites in, check dotlan, filter to jumps/24hr and look for highsec pockets in each region in your area that have very low numbers compared to the rest of the region.
---
Raging dumpster fire is worse than incompetence though

The issue isn’t so much the list but that i cant push an update to where the coalition map pulls its data
---
Read the title and I though you meant fail by the spelling error “weather” ...whether?
---
Lol yeah I actually had missed that until someone pointed it out.
---
Should probably check your sources.
---
Learning how to gauge the distance between you and what you intend to pilot around is a learned skill so don't be discouraged if you have a hard time with it at first.
---
And as far as zooming goes make sure you aren't holding Ctrl or Alt which one of them is bound to adjust the FOV instead of zoom level by default.
---
I replied to some comments below but this is actually an issue of me not being able to push an update to the place this map pulls the list from. I understand the confusion by coalitionsin.space is usually much more accurate because I can edit it as needed
---
Just a note, mixing buffer and active tank is generally not a great idea. You could swap out your plates for a resistance mod and get a better active tank out of it. Also, if you're gonna go dual rep on the incursus, I recommend making one a T2 and one an ancillary rep. Or go with a single rep and a damage mod.
---
Yes. The linked reddit thread includes the information. He made some big non apology thread about 6 months ago and then deleted it later after getting a warm reception to it. Dude is subhuman trash.
---
The juicer bits are basically one guy going full "Big Brother can't make me."
---
 Knowledge is power.When I used to do solo and small scale roaming I was up to date with most popular ships their capabilities I could recall in an instant the traits slot layout resist profile possible fit possible speed dps and ranges.
---
  So I'd say start by learning about the ships how they are used and fit
---
Thank you!
---
Happy to help! The incursus is still one of my favorite solo frigates.
---
Full fleet of incursion Rattles, you mean. No Rorqs in highsec. Or perhaps you mean the Fusion gang fleet?
---
&gt; Mobile Tractor Unit
---
That seems cool, do rats attack them though?
---
It's chill. We have about 5x more alliance ops, which is fun. People have really learned how to live out here, with a 9x increase in 'being on comms' and 8x increase in 'watching intel'. I don't krab as much as I used to, but I was bored of rorqual mining anyway, so I guess the move has cured me of spodbrain? We're still baddies and all, but living like an actual alliance and not a giant swarm of bees is a nice change of pace.

&gt; escalation which is a 3/10
---
So I kill stuff for escalation only and not the loot or reward?
---
&gt; As a note a Gnosis can't run most of the highsec gated sites
---
Yeah, that's a problem I'm having but Navy issue Vexor is pretty expensive for me tbh, I already spent so much money.
---
That post is from March 16. We don't know where you are or what you're doing, nor do we care. Just go away.
---
I'm not going out like anything. Like I said, I've done nothing wrong. But hey - if the Mods want to sit here and act like this shit is okay, that's bullshit. This has nothing to do with EVE or anything else - it's targeted harassment at me by a guy who isn't well.
---
Yeah pretty much, unless a faction ship spawns at the end of the anomalies (they'll be named differently and drop good loot sometimes), the unrated/ded sites and escalations have very good loot, there's plenty of guides on each of them online.
---
A normal Vexor with is fine for most of these sites, just won't be as quick at clearing them.
---
Nope.
---
There are many links to how to start eve, your best bet is to read a few of those, at the very least do part of the tutorial and all of the career agent missions and from there expand upon what you like. 
---
Be wary, some supposedly newbro corps are just going to use you to make money. Choose what and who you join carefully. 
---
&gt;!Can't hunt cloaked ships though. Can't do that. You can get lucky and decloak them or possibly instalock them on gates to prohibit them from cloaking, but you can't hunt cloaked ships. 
---
Anything else is far game in eve.!&lt;
---
I'm in the middle of doing all the intro quests/tutorial now. How are you able to cloak a ship it seems like when I come out of warp I'm automatically cloaked but then it fades
---
Gila*
---
Gila works too but is a whole lot more expensive.
---
I found flying T1 battlecruisers really helpful for learning - they're slow, of course, but they die slowly enough that you can realize the mistakes you make in real time. A buffer fit like a double-web Hurricane or bulkhead Brutix does lots of damage, doesn't require too much thinking, and insures really, really well.  
---
Kiting frigs, like a Retribution or a Slicer, can also let you stay on grid for a long time if you fly cautiously, but you die very quickly when you mess up.
---
dc and timeout. one was to a legit, normal dc and one i was desynced and ccp still denied me lol
---
Missed opportunity to call it Pub Crawl.
---
You might see brisc there
---
Watch Sutonia’s rail comet video on YouTube, his channel’s name is “Eve is easy” 
---
You could try some of his other fits, but the rail comet is the most straightforward, so if you’re just learning then it’s best
---
Pretty cool, but I think with a little audio editing you could possibly make the sun noises slightly louder than they currently are. Maybe this is what you were going for though, as if you were in the cock-pit.
---
When you use a gate or wormhole you are cloaked for 60 seconds or until you move.
---
To cloak while moving or recloak after the above; you need a cloaking device equipped and toggled on.
---
To cloak while warping you need a covert ops cloak.
---
cloak is a module, alphas can't use it
---
when you jump into a new system you have 1min cloak invul timer, otherwise that's it without a cloak mod
---
fuck test
---
To be honest, I'm new to this, so that's definitely something I can work on. There are many interesting places to record so I hope to get better. Thanks for the advice!
---
I mean, if you're suggesting strat, gila is not so far away in terms of isk and is much more easy to fit and forgiving of pilot errors because lol passive tank and press f
---
it takes learning, getting used to, and unfucking the highly configurable ui
---
Yeah I actually forgot Gila is a cruiser.
---
Rats - no. Players do. Concord does nothing if someone shoots your mtu. There are players that shoot tractors in hopes that the owner agresses them so they can then kill their pve boats. Welcome to eve.
---
u/mossyblog wtb context
---
Save up for a Stratios. The massive drone bay will do the work, including salvage, and you can fit analyzers for data and relic sites. Plus a cloak. Basically you only ever need to dock up to drop your loot off.
---
No problem, just remember to keep all the original audio recordings files you like and NAME THEM something that is descriptive, this way if you put more time into playing with the files and editing them, you won't "lose" the ones you were looking for and have to listen to each one. Possible even use something like Audacity to cut clips of the audio into pieces and have individual sounds you can play around with.
---
Every site in high sec apart from DED 4/10 and possibly Lookout/Watch is a waste of time, unless you want to run Dens for escalations.
---
I can't fly a 100mil+ ship, I have like 10 days in the game, not enough money or experience to be honet.
---
It was pretty loud. Got annoying in short order if you had to be around a gate for a while.
---
At the time I even thought: those gate campers must be seven kinds of nuts to want to listen to that for hours on end.
---
One day, after an update: no more banging.
---
I don't think it's that great then, I would lose like 10+ mil everytime someone decides to attack it, that would be annoying.
---
also interested in this fit. been thinkin about spending like a bn on one for a mini imp lol
---
they are the only competent factor in gotg atm
---
Yes, you are. You are going out, of a video game, kicking and screaming and making it a spectacle. They're his chat logs (maybe) not embarrassing pictures of you in your underwear. You're a grown man, get a grip.
---
This game is all about goals man :-)
---
"There is no way to do X."
---
"Yes there is, for example, try method Y."
---
"So the *only* way is to do Y."
---
Were you born this obnoxious or did you have to work at it?
---
I checked them. Looks like the CEO said everyone should rat and mine in Delve because Fountain it "too hot"
---
Do all the Seekers missions, all the various Career Agents, and then Advanced Military Training. You get a bunch of ships, isk, and components.
---
The arrow keys will turn your ship, it’s not quite what your looking for, but it’s been helpful to me when I want to approach something at an angle. Like the others said double clicking works very well too. 
---
At the end of th Adv Military you’ll get a Destroyer. With that you can criuse highsec (1.0-0.5 security status) doing lvl 1 missions and start exploring. The in-game Exploration (as opposed to just wandering and getting lost—which is totally fine and fun) gets a bit complex with probe launchers, a whole scanning mechanic, and a hacking mini-game. I suggest you watch a video to really ‘get it’. 
---
Get real comfortable with the Agency window, the World Map, and the Scanner Window to see what’s around you (ie: the Agency window tells you what lvl combat site are that you just found by scanning). I’ve recently found the Security Status option of the World Map very helpful since which Empire controls the space I’m in isn’t very helpful— you can travel to any Empire’s space regardless of what race you are. 
---
Stick to lvl 1 sites, each lvl roughly corresponds to a class of ship so lvl 1 is frigates/destroyers, lvl 2 is cruisers, and so on. I mean roughly because you can sometimes squeak by with a little luck/skill. 
---
Oh, and train whatever skills make you happy, and you can always throw new skills on to the top of the list to train right away (well, not if you have more than 24hr queued but it is pretty permissive). 
---
Good luck!
---
&gt; Yeah pretty much, unless a faction ship spawns at the end of the anomalies (they'll be named differently and drop good loot sometimes), the unrated/ded sites and escalations have very good loot, there's plenty of guides on each of them online.
---
I think you worded that wrong because I'm not sure if I understand it. Should I kill stuff for escalation chance only? About guides, can you point me one if you have the time because I googled it and couldn't find a decent guide for my situtation.
---
&gt; A normal Vexor with is fine for most of these sites, just won't be as quick at clearing them.
---
I was using a Vexor but it takes so much time and needs micro managing, I just blast every rat with a Gnosis.
---
Yep, my current goal is a Thanatos lol, I've got 2.5b isk, nearly done getting all the prerequisites done, only like another 150 days once my 170 day queue is done until I can sit in the hull with it fit.
---
What are they not doing that they did before?   
---
Legacy is double the numbers of PANFAM, Imperium is 4 times the numbers of PANFAM. There isn't any room for PANFAM to do anything
---
Would you be able to take a bunch with you if you stockpile them before a mirror?
---
If your intro to marketing class taught you that selling an inferior product for more money was going to draw customers to you, I would normally recommend getting your money back...
---
...but in your case I would recommend giving them more money.
---
Ok so combat anomalies normally have shit loot but occasionally at the end will have a special faction ship spawn that you absolutely want to loot. But short of that just find the anomalies, kill everything and move on.

That I dont know. I dont see why not, though. Id like to test an Onyx fit on t5's, so I hope so.
---
I mean isn't "dont fly a ship you can't afford to lose" is the motto of the game? I can't afford to lose 150 mil because I have like total of 150.
---
Don't we all. I'm putting bets on Aridia
---
Always take the bait
---
Unless it's a HIC
---
then maybe don't take the bait
---
Brawling is super bad right now and probably woulnt get any better, so that means blasters dont have the projection to be useful. Large acs can be ok, but medium acs are pretty bad, they dont have great projection but also dont have the dps of blasters

Clicked hoping for humping noises from your bedroom. Stayed because its eve video.

钱到位，人到位 ( one of their meme, kind of "money is in place, then people are in place")
---
Lussy is nice if you want Battleship pvp but those ships are not super useful for understanding engagement profiles or how to do stuff besides probably the best tank management in the game.
---
Lasker is a really good one because he has a few T1 frigate videos where he does a fantastic job explaining how he fights and which fights he takes.
---
A better question is WHO is still teaching pvp??
---
red vs blue once had classes
---
does eve U still teach it??
---
No, like most things in your old age, you're wrong about that too. I shitted on Manny for doing that too, you'll need to try harder Malcanis
---
I was kinda hoping someone would come along and destroy my ship while I was recording. 
---
Maybe my plan is to lure in watchers and then upload a troll video with a random jump scare in the middle :P
---
The best fights are when you bait the bait. :)
---
There's lots of advice (good and bad) in this thread already, but let's back up and think about some initial questions:
---
**What** ***sort*** **of PVP are you trying to get good at?**
---
Most of the answers you're getting assume that you're interested in 1v1 (more or less) PVP set pieces. This is faction warfare style, but is very much not the only type of PVP available. I personally prefer a slower cloak-based stalking/baiting style played in wormhole space. Others run with a highly asymmetrical style common in nullsec, where you are simultaneously predator and prey, and there really isn't much overlap. Practicing any of these (yes, even the "F1 Monkey" style of large nullsec fleets) will help you get better at PVP mechanics, so long as you reflect on what you're doing and think about how you can do it better next time.
---
**What is your budget?**
---
You state that you previously had no way to financially replace all of your ships. This is false. You may have had no way to financially replace the particular ships you were losing, or more likely you weren't happy with the amount of PVE that you would need to do following your current isk-making strategy. *This is fine*. I bring this up not because you're doing something bad, but because when trying to learn, you should think about a sustainable pattern of ship loss. I would think about it this way:
---
First, how much time do you have that you want to devote to EVE? Break it down into time you want to spend relaxing (PVE) and time you want to spend with fun content (PVP).
---
Using the PVE time, calculate an estimate of how much you can afford to straight-up welp each session. (For example, I enjoy relaxing by huffing gas for an hour, so with 2 characters and averaging 30m/venture load off whatever w-space gas is convenient, I'm looking at \~120m to play with.)
---
While you're learning, do assume that you're going to lose your ship every time. Insure it. When in doubt, take the bait and learn from it.
---
Is the ship (or ships) you're looking at more expensive than your budget? If so, stop! Look at something cheaper. Conversely, the folks recommending Rifters may be recommending something *too* cheap for you. I'd say if your expected losses is worth less than about half of your free isk per session, you are probably going too cheap and should step it up a bit. More expensive ships often (not always!) have a wider engagement profile, which will make it easier for you to find fights you have a shot at winning.
---
Brawl in, lock, shoot+scram+web, pray that you kill the other faster.
---
In all seriousness, learn range control and figure out from ship what kind of fit the enemy is possibly flying. Use d-scan, a lot.
---
And don't be afraid of taking fights. Yeah you may lose shitton of ships but you'll learn more that way imo. Every fight adds to your experience. Just avoid fights where you know that  your ships will be instapopped.
---
So... you go to work to get money.  Have that weekly get together for 20-30 quid with peeps buying food, beer, etc.
---
Cut that shit one time a month, sub account, play for fun instead of grinding your life away...?
---
And operated by NC. leadership ever since it was started.
---
hey there, I notice you're digging a lot of holes recently, can I interest you in a selection of shovels?
---
Destruction is another form of creation as they say
---
&gt; There is also first person camera mode that uses the arrow keys (?) to fly your ship around, but I'm garbage at doing that and it limits your view of what is going on around you in space.
---
You don't actually have to use first-person to use the arrow keys. I use them in the default camera mode because I can't get doubleclick to be as responsive as I'd like.
---
Agreed.  It's like 1 evening out with mates.  Hell, I can buy 2-3 months for what I used to put out for on my day out.  I just cut back on the amount of alcohol I drank for 1 day a month and bam.  Subscription taken care of.
---
Man, it's been a while. I used to love the old cloak noises too back in Empyrean age/Quantum rise I think it was.
---
I take it the only way to become omega is to either buy plex or save up alot of isk to buy it off the marketplace?
---
That's assuming you're in an area where people come looking for MTU to hassle and blow up. If you're in a low pop system, nobody will hassle you.
---
Okay I just read it, I have two questions if you don't mind.
---
* First, it says expeditions can be very dangerous, if I trigger an escalation in Hisec can the mission be on lowsec? Can I get killed by other players in expeditions basically.
---
* Second, with Gnosis, which sites should I always visit, can you give me a list or link because guide doesn't say that also Gnosis isn't that common I guess.
---
Whoa hang on. Waiting to PVP until you're better at it is setting yourself up for failure. Shoot me a message with some rough details on your current SP situation and I can recommend some decent fits. You can also find fits for just about any ship on the eve-uni wiki, but keep in mind that many of those are optimized for fleet combat.
---
Yyyyaaaawwwwnnnn.. Think I might check on my skills this week.
---
I may try it then, maybe, I don't know.
---
Oh god imagine eve with no sov and no capital ships.
---
My body needs this.
---
Lil mind trick to help with piloting: you're not piloting the ship, you are the ship and you give yourself commands where to go.
---
For some reason, that helped me to realise how I should actually try to pilot the ships.
---
This is a great vid. Unfortunately the Youtube version has lost its sound :(
---
Great find
---
As a new player just now grinding out ISK for injectors I'd be fucked.  I've skilled into VNI ratting and ship losses would cripple me. I have imperfect skills and as it is, it takes me about 2.3 hrs to recoup a lost ship.
---
Oof
---
Ok so escalations will show up in the agency tab an tell you where you're going and yes some of them can go to lowsec, just ignore those ones. The gated escalations and don't show up on the probe scans so people would need to use combat probes to find your ship so in highsec you're probably ok but as always just keep an on on your dscan.
---
DED rated sites the security level X/10 is also the size limit, so for example 1/10 means frigates and corvettes only, 3/10 cruisers or smaller except for T3Cs, 5/10 and up is battleship or smaller except for 10/10s which allow pretty much everything.
---
I'm not entirely sure on the size limit for unrated sites but the table on the page I linked should have that info.
---
# The Herald has spoken
---
Shame, I remember ham sac what brawl fondly. Haven't done much small gang, 
---
*done it like twice that I remember.
---
once with a bunch off random cruiser to gank some cocky mining bardges with carrier support. Made the mistake off bring a brick tanked gila where everyone else was taking fast cruisers. Only landed after they all arived an had killed on bardge, had to almost instantly run from a onxy an drake. Managed to cost out off the onyxs focus point an warp before archon an chimera landed.*
---
No need to WASD to move your ship. Just double click in space and your ship will fly into a straight line toward that point. Also if you hold Q and click in space, you will see a visual showing your ships trjectory and click agaid (while holding Q) to send it off in that direction. Practice make perfect when "manually" piloting but it doesn't need to be as intensive as you may think.
---
They really did a good job with the gate redesign. Nice work art team
---
May 5th that may change somewhat... some market snipes may get cheap Gnosis, but... probably not a Praxis that cheap
---
FW space is pretty good, hunting in WHs is also fun but is a bit slower.
---
I was in a Novice PLEX when it ended up turning into a 5v1 :/
---
From my experience, exploration in hs (relic/datas) is not really worth doing, save for the occasionnals ghost sites (covert research facilities) and sleeper caches. 
---
What really earned me billions is \[DED\]( [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat\_sites#DED\_rated\_complexes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#DED_rated_complexes)) running, mostly in angel space (metropolis). 3/10s can drop a shield booster worth 150m, and 4/10s an adaptive invul worth 350m. Sites belonging to pirate factions other than the Angels and the Guristas tend to only drop drop armor platings which are worth nothing. 
---
You can't enter 3/10 with your Gnosis though, so as others said consider upgrading to a Vexor navy or a Gila, it's an investment but it will pay off really quickly.
---
When scanning you'll also find \[unrated sites\]( [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat\_sites#Unrated\_complexes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#Unrated_complexes)) . I never run those except for drone sites (hauted yard/desolate site/chemical yard) which usually drop 20-30m worth of drone capillary fluid and are very fast to clear.
---
Imo don't bother running anomalies unless you have multiples accounts farming for DED escalations.
---
fuck me...
---
 i dont get that meme
---
Dscan constantly will help reduce the frequency of this
---
FW space is pretty much what you want, but it's hard to find "fair" fights in this game. 
---
When you enter a complex, keep scanning towards the entry gate, and if  you see lots of people there suddenly, warp off.
---
Yea..it happens more and more, I generally go to quieter systems surrounding places like tama, which can be a little more 1v1 orientated.
---
Well yeah it was a 1v1 and I was checking D-Scan, but couldn’t do Shit since he scrambled me
---
Are you running missions? Simply killing NPCs? What part of space/system are you in and what kinds of pirates are you trying to fight?
---
What if the guy I’m fighting has already screamed me?
---
Just thinking of that sound gets my heart racing
---
I dunno.  Sounds like solo PvP to me.
---
I smell some BOT plot here?
---
Are you doing missions?
---
Are you mining?
---
Are you doing data and relic sites?
---
OK I now realise and accept that for some reason you're trying to equate Manny giving his alliance leadership a headstart on the supercapital changes with me saving myself a single trip from an NPC station to a POS in the same system, but it's kind of baffling to me that you think it's worth the effort when I don't even play any more. The poo-flinging monkey brigade here will fling poo regardless, whether you join in or not.
---
holy hell where do you find these 0ms NPCs
---
&gt; Good stuff.
---
I really felt the opposite. The whole video just seemed like a joke - the only 'threat' was that Marshal (as close a hard counter as someone could have reasonably brought), and it was shrugged off with no effort at all. 
---
The Imp was doing &gt;8k/sec ffs. Given it had DPS, control and some tank too is just *insane*. That's easily enough to outrun any missiles or drones (hell - even a bling Orthrus fit?), and that kind of transversal also means he won't really be hit by any turrets in the game either (laughably far out of range for blasters which I think are the only thing that have enough transversal to hit something moving that fast, and other turrets simply won't apply noteworthy damage either - certainly not at the 30-60km engagement range he's fighting at). Nothing can get close enough to apply any control at that kind of speed (maybe a lucky boosh but that's laughably unlikely).
---
Even double webbed he's doing practically 1.9k/sec and the passive cap-regen is enough to allow the AB to cycle even under three neuts of pressure (perhaps poorly staggered, but even so). 
---
I get that its ballsy to take these things out (pilots can always make mistakes), that the abyssal mods on this thing are probably the cost of the ship again on top of its hundred-plus billion valuation and that obviously you'd be really risk averse flying this kind of thing... but this is just ... lame. No challenge, no threat.
---
Top belt in Tama
---
I will upgrade to navy Vexor after making some money then.
---
So I can only go 4/10 yet, what about 5/10?
---
&gt; no oversight body or ways for redress
---
Just like real-life.
---
https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html
---
Is this a multiple choice question?
---
Believe it or not, but SiSi is a great place to learn. Plenty of people on there always looking to pvp, and everything is 100isk
---
FW is the best place outside staged fights (e.g. with corp mates). Yes, you'll end up 1v4 sometimes - that's Eve. At least one side of that fight is still solo :-)
---
The worm gets a bonus to shield resistances, so Armor tanking it would be a little weird. You could do it though )
---
Farming 3/10s in Gallente space is usually worth the time, and the Serpentis Lookout unrated is great, escalation chains a bunch of ungated highsec pockets with a faction spawn in each. Serpentis Vigil is also fun and again pretty valuable escalation but that one can be brutal on the later sites (scram/web frigates and elite battleships).
---
&gt; The gated escalations and don't show up on the probe scans so people would need to use combat probes to find your ship so in highsec you're probably ok but as always just keep an on on your dscan.
---
But if someone attacks me wouldn't they get attacked by CONCORD?
---
Pray to Bob almighty that you can warp off
---
\*Ohh Deer  
---
Have to spell the ccp way
---
5/10 are insanely hard and very rare in highsec.
---
It's a botter region at the bottom of the map. Think Omist but to the left.
---
yes. also t1,t3 filaments are seeded on sisi as filament crates.
---
Just shot you a message
---
Be the guy that 5v1s other solo pvpers, but tell the other 4 that you wanna get a solo kill and to not interfere.     
---
The best solo PvP is done together.
---
"Looks like"?
---
You'll definitely make some friends in game. :)
---
U Gandhi?
---
Only thing I hear is "...Gate Fire! Gate Fire! Dictors bubbles at zero and 12 km, preheat everything!"
---
You can also just buy a subscription.  It's a little cheaper than buying plex with RL money.
---
Hics are awesome. Lost internet during stratop once, got stranded behind enemy lines in a plated devoter. 20 jumps through lowsec to get back home, through enemy staging no less. I can do this.
---
Step 1) Set Name -&gt; "Not Bait"
---
Step 2) Gate 20 jumps without being aggressed once.
---
I have to politely disagree. There were multiple situations that were very risky (e.g. Marshal, Ishtar drones), on top of that, it’s super risky to just fly that in any fight. A wrecking shot by a Hurricane could just volley you and could happen any time due to RNG, somebody could have decloaked a rapier, or any of the cruisers that actually sometimes got webs on could have been full hardcounter/bait fit. 
---
If you look closely you could also see how great the piloting itself was.
---
Saying that it was no effort/challenge is in my view fairly disrespectful.  Also, please stick to facts when attempting to trash talk. FYI Orthrus light missiles go 16km/s.
---
On the other hand I do have one point I would criticize myself, which is ammo choice. I am a huge fanboy of TS Infra myself, but it seemed weird to me to see it loaded all the time. Same with the X-RAY, I think someone is too used to flying Retri. ;)

Just my 2 ISK.

Join horde, awox ratters in the belt. Get that KB looking real green. jk jk
---
Think about mirco gang pvp as well. We is usually 2-5 people who fight in solo-ish manner. Everyone is responsible for their own ship, role, tackle, etc. but you have enough to firepower to take down some shinier stuff or other gangs. 
---
Amarr/Minimatar is a great place. We just moved to kamela and get 1v1s quite a bit. We also microgang 4-5 nights a week. Good luck!
---
Best tip for eve pvp, always count on stupid.
---
The amount of morons in the game who don't have a clue whta they are doing.  You can get some juicy kills by going balls deep.

I’m not going anywhere. This guy is engaging in what is thinly veiled extortion, and assholes like you are ignoring it to try to give me a hard time. Enough.

only reason im waiting to do that is i generally dont drop money unless i know 100% im gonna play the game for more than a week. And since im still learning the game i rather do that last

You can check the corps of people in local. If alot are from the same corp as your target, they might  be baiting.

Lies. Every time I do that, a tengu probes me down for his titan and super. Killed his tengu the 2nd try in my carrier when I simply put on more heavy neuts and managed to warp off as the big boys landed.
---
But seriously, it's not as much fun testing stuff out when a few nerds just wait to bring in the no-fun titan or such.
---
Some horrible advice here, nothing else to expect all things considered.
---
First of all make sure your user interface is pvp fit. This means...
---
A.) you need good empty space in the middle of your screen in both left / right / above so you can double click for 45 degree approach/deproach angle. Your overview / dscan / local etc... can't cover the entire left side of your screen for example. A good tip is to move your dscan over your local list partially so the talk box is completely covered.
---
B.) keep combat log always on your screen and filter out your own damage from the settings. You only want this to easily see your opponent's weapon system etc... the floating log is horrible for this purpose and very easy to miss.
---
C.) you can move your target list from the cross in the top left corner, the default placement is simply horrible.
---
D.) rebind default hotkeys to like asdfgh and have overheats on qwerty, maybe even xc with zv as heats.
---
E.) keep a tab in your overview devoted to scouting out targets, this means beacons, stargates, fw ihub, maybe planets (will also scout out belts and moons) etc... use auto-tracking view (always keep this permanently toggled or have a hard hotkey like P or something) for easy 5% dscans.
---
Manual flying (every video I've seen on youtube is shit)
---
A.) your combat zoom level should be at least 50-75km (use tactical overlay), use alt-2 camera mode.
---
B.) sit at around 40km or more from the beacon in fw to identify opponent's fit from his speed / approach and give yourself time to react against mwd overheat etc. Use this time to understand in your mind if you're the chaser or chased (blaster atron means you fly away from him, noob tristan with point fit means you chase him).
---
C.) as a kiter you want to always be faster than your opponent if at all possible, if you're using MWD fit you can manually set your desired speed by clicking the speed bar in different locations (you should always know certain breakpoints in your MWD speed bar). This is very important when flying something like a kite beam punisher or when you want to masquerade as an AB fit.
---
D.) to let your opponent close in on you, look at your ship from the opponents direction (both ships centered) and double click on the side of your screen (fly away from enemy at 45% degree angle)... this means even if you're faster, opponent will close in because you're not flying away directly, once he gets too close and you want to generate distance, simply use keep at range.
---
E.) to approach your opponent (he's trying to disengage or slingshot), click his target icon with auto-track view on (this should always be ON in solo pvp) OR click next target hotkey if he's your only target, the view will automatically perfectly align for you to double click for 45% approach angle, and right after clicking you want to reconsider if he's slingshotting (soften approach to at least 90% angle by moving the camera view and double clicking the edge of your screen).... or if he's badly hurt it's probably a disengage for real and you want to keep point with more aggressive approach.
---
F.) keep at range command should always have a very long range like 70km or something, the only reason you use this is to fly away from opponent at perfect angle automatically to maximize your outward speed, you never ever ever... ever use this to actually keep a certain range.
---
G.) never use orbit command unless it's to finish an already won fight or you're flying some noob shit double web AB fit.
---
As for combat you definitely don't want to fly brawl fits if your intent is to get good (once you're proficient at kiting and understand manual control, tracking, speed and the impact of MWD on tracking and dps, you're already proficient in all other forms of combat automatically, be it chase brawl or kite). Fly kitey long range ships and possibly downgrade to mid range when you have perfect control. Use pyfa's dps projection tool to better understand the impact of tracking and speed on damage. Just because your ship CAN fly at 4k with beams or arty doesn't mean it's a good idea to do so when your facing an AB blaster opponent. Likewise you don't want to line yourself against arty when flying with scorch because you have better tracking.
---
If you're flying an AB fit and you come across some bad tracking disrupt mwd kiter, do a reverse slingshot to get out of point range.
---
Incredibly vast majority of your opponents are simply bad (as this thread indicates) and only camp fw beacons with dual web fits (firetail being most common noob ship from my experience) or fast locking tackle like slasher/atron for easy automatic wins against worse tracking with range control. You really don't want to be entering plexes against these because even if you escape firetail's scram with MWD, you won't escape the webs. I recommend flying something everyone and his dog wants to fight (like arty rifter or beam punisher) and simply be the first on site.
---
Too bad fw is really dead and finding good fights takes a ridiculously long time. You will however find plenty of noobs who want to fight your T1 in their firetail.
---
Like the Transformers?
---
Okay, I will take that chance then. Thanks for your help.
---
So basically I have 4/10 DEDs and unrated drone sites. You probably have much more money than me though maybe you would recommend me doing other unrated sites for escalation chances? No?
---
Run 4/10s, Drone Unrateds, and Vigils, you might be able to do Lookouts but I'm unsure on those.
---

---
u said 10 billion right???
---
Like they said, you just have to set goals. It doesn't mean "get into a Stratios today". It means, work towards getting into a Stratios eventually. =)
---
For only being 10 days old, I'd say you shouldn't be looking any further than a Frigate or Destroyer. Those are cheap and easy to replace as you learn what is going on.
---
Depending on budget you can basically fit it 1:1 like the imp but fill the last rig slot with EM rig, that only works if you are using very very well rolled MSE and AB. You can also fit it with a Medium Ancil, which works well with bling because it has no PWG issues, but on cheapfits runs into COU trouble. You can then choose between dual Locus rigs, or Locus+Polycarbon. Third is EM rig ofc. Lowslots are basically always dual heat sink and one nanofiber. Without the interceptor range bonus, a rolled defensive web is also probably better than a scram
---
I use them for L3-L4 missions all the time. Warp in, maybe cruise into range a bit, and then drop the MTU and set orbit around it. That keeps you moving and harder to hit. Then you kill everything, and let the MTU collect the wreckage.
---
What's the next level of ISK making potential after VNI ratting? Would prefer combat skills overlap in training. I.E. no mining. I have a ship capable of doing lvl 4 missions but I'm over it.
---
"out here" in the deep wilderness of fountain lol
---
After he gives you the 20m, give it to me and ill give you 100m
---
Fly point or scram kiting fits with solid range control so you can just leave if it turns that way
---
I'm actually using them right now, risk of losing 10mil worth it I guess.
---
Ok vily settle down.
---
It's pretty satisfying sometimes, particularly if you're helping someone who's asked for help in local chat.  You know they've spent the past 10-15 minutes trying to kill Dagan, and then you show up, two-cycle him, and warp off.
---

You can try to escape it by manual piloting. On mobile now so I can't really link it but check eve uniwiki about manual piloting
---
Well that's factually true. You're not going anywhere because you're already gone. Like the ghost of christmas past you're just trying to grab on to what little relevancy you had.
---
Only naturally spawning 5/10's are rare in highsec. You can generate them by doing Refuge combat anomalies and a good portion of the time the resulting 5/10 escalation will be in a high-sec system (albeit sometimes on an island).
---
The 5/10 isn't hard so much as time-consuming, unless you're lacking in skills (which I suppose you would be). Prepare to spend an hour or two doing one until you get your skills up to snuff and learn to maintain good transversal.
---
One Word, contracts.
---
That's the beauty of eve. I'm a solo pvp oriented player, but I found a small corp in which the people amazing. They tough me a lot about pvp trade craft, they're all very friendly, very helpful and I feel at home playing with them. I'm not a talkative person, but they don't give a shit that I'm quiet on comms most of the time. So finding a fun bunch of space nerds will greatly increase the fun and experience of eve for you. Find some mining friends a mine the shit out of those rocks while laughing at some nonsense that you're talking with your corp mates and that will make you enjoy eve.

A huge part of learning solo pvp is to learn when to fight and when to run away. The rest is learning the actual fight. Even though you're getting killed, you're learning that when 1 frigate arrives in your FW site and local immediately bumps up by 5, it's time to run. You're also learning that certain alliances or corporations simply won't fight you solo and you should run away if a member of that entity comes close to you "solo".
---
I farm Refuge every day and they give 3/10s not 5/10s.
---
cooperate with players, you wouldn't lose ships
---
Getting into solo pvp in this game is rather hard. I play this game for 10yrs with over 5000 kills, but only fleet fights. 
---
The solo fights themself arnt that bad, there are good and easy fits. The problem is finding them and actual winning. Its not fun to fly around for 30min to just die to someone, who is better then you, has more money or more friends.
---
But without practice you will never become decent. And practice means dying. Alot.
---
Extortion would be coming to you with the logs and threatening to release them unless you paid. This isn't "thinly veiled extortion," and you can't claim to be a public figure in one reddit post then claim it's harassment when someone mentions your name in a different one.

"Let's start with a quick tl;dr version, refer to the rest of the text for further details. After 1.1, players receive 95% of a bounty income in Null Sec. An active ESS in a system changes the direct payout value to 80%, but further 20% is stored in a system-wide pool that can be accessed through the ESS. This additional bounty payment can rise to 25% over time. So post-1.1, players have the choice to either skip using an ESS and get 95% bounty value, or use ESS and generate 100% up to 105% of bounty value, but have a portion of it be at risk."

Lol, Manny didnt give PL leadership any heads up on capital changes bud, sorry to shit on this theory you have.  See, this is what I'm talking about, you accuse another alliance of cheating, while cheating yourself, but you have quite literally zero evidence to support that statement, whereas we have you openly admitting to it. Had he actually given me, Elise, Shadoo or Penif any information, we'd have gotten banned as well, like Pando, only oddly that didnt happen. Weird right?

im sorry but there is no way im apologizing to you
---
Intel is paramount to finding good engagements, learn to use the d scan and never stop using it. If possible, have a second monitor with zkillboard open and look up people you'll potentially be fighting, this allows you to see what type of ship they fly, what kind of fits they use. It's also pretty good for figuring what is bait (if you see a solo pilot but his KB history consists almost entirely of him and his friends ganking solo pilots, expect a gank).
---
If you're doing solo pvp, realize that most people will be looking to bait and gank you. Good engagements can sometimes be few and far between.

The worm is in fact a drone boat so that's not surprising. You don't really need range control on it because it's just a ball of stats.

wrecking shots.

i run them in glass cannon snipers so whenever the drifter/drone battleship rolls a wrecking shot (1% chance per cycle, 3x dmg infinite range infinite tracking) and i happen to not be at full health OR they land 2 wrecking shots during an encounter (unlikely but it has happened) yeah im dead

Idk man, i've had a couple of fun encounters with the GBT dudes. They'll throw everything they got at you (in a positive sense), even if it's just 20 bombers and in my experience aren't super risk averse, at least with smaller stuff. They'll work together with outside-groups when it's favourable for them and they've pulled of a lot of great drops on careless crabs.
---
They aren't bottom feeders, they're just a small group of guys doing their own thing and they've done it in their home region for so many years now. I respect that.
---
Didn't ask for your snidey remark douchebag

Also on the map: Fedup is part of Galmilstan, Infensus and Razor are neutral, and only one Querious alliance is actually part of the QFC. Yeah, the coalition list could use an update.
---
what really got me off guard was that he PM me like less than a minute after the original contract was made....so I thought that this was a guy looking for the items I was trading just at that moment. Now I know better...... they have contracts DSCAN! lol
---
the guy who died mining in lowsec calling the guys who killed him carebears  is the best part
---
Is there any good reason to use the trade window for anything but scamming? I feel like contracts are just a strictly better option
---
I like bjornbee on YouTube. He's fun to watch.
---
Probably escalations. Depending on where you live, escalations can be really lucrative. I know serpentis and Sansha space both have 6/10s with a chance for an a type enam, worth about 1 bil, and the Sansha one for sure can be run in a gila. Ideal ship would be to use either a tengu or rattlesnake, tengu is nicer if you wanna scan them down, rattle is better in some cases (like the angel 10/10) because it has more tank. There are 4 levels of rated escalations, and 5 of unrated for every rat type in nullsec. I’d ask around first, see which are any good where you live, and if your Corp has any write ups on them.
---
Yea your doing them wrong mate. Escalations and scaned combat sites are there for the lewt not the bounty. Even a 10/10 only does like 20-30m bounty.
---
All ded sites drop overseer effects this is usually worth something but its kinda terrible till you get to lowsec. That being said any container or rat that spawns the OSEs  has a chance to spawn ded modules. In highsec I think they only spawn c types. Run gurista or sansha, serpentis or blood raider 4s for decent lewt potential.

We are limited on how many teams we can bring onto Thunderdome as it involves creating accounts on that server, which is something CCP is doing on a volunteer basis in order to allow us to put on this tournament. In the future I'd like to expand it, but it's me working within the limited toolset I have to produce the best show.
---
The teams were selected to try and give a good AT showing from lots of different areas of space (HS/LS/NS), though the two WH teams I approached declined to participate. Two teams were chosen very late in the process as they were the first to apply to an open call that was put out on Twitter; Brave and Stay Frosty, and we greatly appreciate them putting together teams on short notice.

There are prizes as mentioned in the show, but they are as follows;
---
* First place: Apostle Lavacore Imperial SKIN and 500 PLEX per player.
---
* Second place: Drekavac Metamateria Exotica SKIN and 200 PLEX per player
---
* Third place: Hecate Caille Neon SKIN and 100 PLEX per player

---
Pirates/NPC are different depending on the region of space you are in. Just like how Caldari is different from Minmatar is different from Amarr is different from Gallente, etc. 
---
Pirates/NPS, the ones you fight on the gate and in belts and in missions, are different too just like how the main Factions are. So you will want to use the correct damage resistance modifiers for your shield or your armor to protect against what the Pirates/NPC are using against you. Additionally, the Pirates/NPC have weaknesses too and you will want to figure out what kind of ammunition, missiles, or drones you will need to kill them efficiently.
---
And if that isn't clear enough, here's a couple examples:
---
The Angel Cartel heavily uses Explosive damage against you. So you will want to gear your tank to protect against Explosive. Coincidentally, they are also weak to Explosive so your ammo, missiles, or drones should be focused on doing Explosive damage.
---
The main reason ECM drones aren't used more often then they already are is because they have a poor jam chance and sometimes you need light drones to either chase off or kill frigates. There are also some ships that rely on drones entirely for damage. That being said most ships that can carry multiple flights of drone will have at least one set of EC-300s, and if they aren't drone ships sometimes they will carry them and nothing else. They are in fact incredibly popular, particularly when compared to the other EWAR drones.

Many of them were either special edition items given away as x-mas presents or for attending live events. Some others were from the old aruem store (I think that's what it was called), which was the old version of the PLEX store before PLEX was split from 1 per sub to 500 per sub. Another source of these items was special edition versions of the game such as the 10th anniversary edition.
---
&gt; Although you may be able to nab some of your competitor's customers initially, these customers will not be retained in the long run.

Why not? The price is low because Goons, not needing the rental income (your fault if you haven't seen what they already make), are renting out space for low ISK from an actually competent landlord as opposed to northern retards so their less rich opponents lose income.
---
&gt;hey are left with post purchase regret as they realize the price was low for a reason

Oh, you're a genuine drooling retard who compares chinese knockoffs that explode in your face to internet pixel space rented out by the largest group in the game (and one actually willing to prevent the sov space from being taken by other coalitions)

I don't understand why CCP leave the trade window in such a broken state where you can change the amount at the last minute and the trade partner doesn't get to react to it. Players have a legitimate expectation that game mechanics on a trade window will provide some protection. Contract scams are different, they target the person not a bad mechanic.
---
If they can't make the trade window work properly they should just delete it. Pretty much nobody uses it for actual trading anyway.

---
-Be smart, but also run headlong into situations that appear just out of reach. Never forget that most of the people you fight have similar experience to you. So... push yourself. 
---
-Record yourself. Even if you don’t show anyone. You’ll learn a lot. 
---
-Be. Prepared. To. Lose. 
---
-Then, when you do lose, and you’re feeling down... visit your PvP heroes’ Zkill page. Notice that they lose ships too, and the videos that you watch come with losses interspersed around the same timeline, that may not be in the video. 
---
-Fly. Get stomped on. Learn. Undock again. 
---
Have fun out there man!
---
What do the differences in pink and grey lines mean?
---
Also, the assumption that I make these videos for anyone other than myself is where you went wrong.  
---
Myself, and all those invovled, know exactly what's going on and that's good enough for me!

Signifies strongest direct links I think.

it can be alpha, but bear in mind that if you want to extract him you can only extract omega skills
---
Oh fuck we're giant nerds.
---
Better that then some of the more controversial spider diagrams I’ve seen for other subs.
---
If you think taxes to fund among a fuckton of other things the SRP for when you die and the fees to help pay for things such as the jump fuel used when you take an ansiblex gate are "huge amounts" and "scams" you clearly don't understand this game at all.
---
Okay, Bones.
---
I'm not ignoring anything. I just think theres a difference between harrassment and embarrassment. The latter is happening, not the former. I dont think using words like "extortion" will prove effective rhetoric either but do, please, continue the downward spiral we see before us.
---
&gt;I supposed buying a person's retirement is part of buying the ship?
---
Surprisingly accurate, though more specifically what you are paying is their wages plus life insurance. According to the lore it is actually baked into the cost of building the ship if I'm not mistaken.
---
I'm surprised it's not all porn.
---
Nullsec a few years ago. Nowdays its facwar and pray for good fights.
---
I feel like this lied a massive opportunity for crew management for role playing and greater depth of game mechanics hiring skilled workers for ship performance and operations. Creating a valuable resource that would make abandon ship actions save more if your crew if you can get them in escape pods before destruction, and even having them leave as you go down with the ship or something.
---
Could be a 4th ”structure'” slot for crew and cargo management. Bridge upgrades, put expanders and other low slot items here, escape pod upgrades etc
---
Si basically we like to troll the sad mopes who play inferior space MMOs.
---
No surprise there.
---
Good to know. He's been perma banned.
---
That's not a problem. You could also utilize the years of knowledge and maybe, accidentally balance better from the start instead of trying to haphazardly fix it at the end.
---
For me:
---
Early on, not knowing the spawns well enough, or the tactics for dealing with them.

Drifter Battleships. They have a significantly higher-than-normal chance to land wrecking shots, and Karybdis is in a stronger battleship for each Tier of Filament: Foothold, Rearguard, Frontline, Vanguard, and Assault. You're facing Vanguard battleships in T4, you'll be facing Assault battleships in T5. The way I do it is approach at a pretty acute angle (drop mtu by the gate as I pass it), and be ready to activate adcu if I take a wrecking shot, then orbit up close, web to make sure it doesn't fly somewhere you don't want it, and burn it down. I'll kill high-priority cruisers on the way to it (entangling, nullcharge/dissipating need to die, illuminating are a pain but less important), but if there are spare lancers or whatever when I get up close, I'll focus the battleship down first. On the Cerberus I fly I tend to need the adcu and this is the main reason I have it, but if you fly something with more buffer, like a Vedmak, Sacrilege, some Gila fits, etc, you may be OK without.
---
Starving stuff used to kill me, but a Thukker large cap battery, priming appropriate targets, and staying out of red clouds (or using an armor tank and avoiding yellow clouds, which apparently exist but I must not be able to tell the difference) pretty much solves that. You can use a semiconductor memory cell on some fits to multiply the bonus given by the cap battery a bit. If the quad Starving Leshak spawn (which is the most I've seen in a few hundred filaments, with the exception of the construction site where you can get many more) gives you trouble, my method is kiting at around 45-50km until they trigger their first wave of neuts, which will hit for less at that range (optimal 30km + 20km falloff, but they don't seem to try to initially neut past 50km), then you have 24 seconds to close in and kill a couple before the second neut cycle hits.
---
The other thing that killed me a couple times was entering the wrong kind of filament by accident. You can usually survive this but if you get a bunch of brickey battleships in a row or enter a site that nerfs your already-lowest resist, it can hurt.
---
Finally, and I only include this so that you consider this in your risk/reward considerations: I lost one ship to time because my drone window disappeared, and I was using a Gila. Recorded the bug and appealed the loss, but CCP said the bug was "not verified" and didn't refund, which was fine once I figured out what they meant - it was just frustrating before that. I eventually found out, after being insulted (or at least talked down to / belittled / my honesty, intelligence and language skills questioned) for a while by GMs, was a colloquial difference in the meaning of the term "verified" in the way I use it vs the way they intended it. I thought they meant it in the sense of "I can prove that this bug occurred",  - which I did via a recording (sidenote! I strongly recommend setting up NVidia instant replay)- but they meant "The bug is a 'verified' replicable bug on their bug tracker and the devs are aware of / working on it". Basically, if they don't see an error in the server logs, they have a list of "verified" client bugs and if it's not on that list, it's not eligible for reimbursement - so don't interpret their policy the way I did. The policy makes sense for a couple of reasons, most notably as an incentive for people to report bugs instead of just asking for reimbursements - so report bugs when you get them!

I wish we could see Alcohol's KB stats.   I know I've donated 2 rorqs, a couple thanatos and God knows how many blinged out T3s, faction cruisers and frigates.

It will be interesting to see your take if this get reversed.

Obey obey obey obey

Very upset that r/wallstreetbets isnt on there anywhere

grr taxes

It was on the second time he tried to scam me that I got to see the timing and finesse this scammers change the price so you can't notice it. THIS IS BY DESING OF CCP...like they can really make it so that nobody gets scammed if they really wanted to....but I guess it takes the lawless part of the game out in a way....just dont trade to strangers.

Why should you be able to boost your fleet members and immediately dock up only to do it again when the boost runs down?
---
Yeh, we could call the minmatar one the Huginn cause its hugging you with its webs.

Haven't played in like 6 months,  what's new?  Anything change at all?

Lol I entirely forgot recon cruisers even existed...

Is Kinakka a Russian word?

Local removed from null. Goons are no longer a thing. You can't be shot in hs anymore.

You mean letusdig made the apology? mossy didn't - "[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9hqlqs/exkenshin\_member\_apologizing\_for\_doxxing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9hqlqs/exkenshin_member_apologizing_for_doxxing/)" and the audio was heavily edited by admission of the parties who published it.

I mean dislike the guy but at least be honest about it.

Yay,  yay,  booooooo

The map is so confusing to me! It's just lines with dots and I can't seem to get any information out of it. I imagine I'm missing something really obvious, but I've tried looking at guides explaining the map but I only seem to be able to find stuff that looks nothing like map so I'm assuming it's been updated and it's all rather upsetting if I'm honest
---
Or get really lucky and hit that 1bil in 30min....then for the first time ever pay attention to where you are jumping to

Why would they do that if they got you to read a lie?

Honestly, the only real way to learn solo pvp is to just do it.  
---
However, micro gangs can teach you a lot of you get in with the right group, and will teach you many of the skills you need for solo pvp.
