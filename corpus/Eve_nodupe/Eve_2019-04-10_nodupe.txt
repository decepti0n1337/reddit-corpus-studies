DIDN'T YOU SEE MY SIGNAL CARTEL BUMPER STICKER?

---
Just make them force multipliers, give them strong boosts to barges and kill their mining ability. Make solo Rorqs useless.
---
I swear that limitation exists in Paradox games to stop Ironman cheesing
---
That's a pretty salty flight to be fair.
---
The 'cloaking effect' you mention is what happens when you dock in a structure. 
---

---
When structures were first released we would see the cloak effect activate before the inside station loaded. Similar to how safe-logging works. 
---
I assume, then, that the bug is that the game *knows* you are docked, but it doesn't move your client's session into the station environment. 
---
This would give you the ability to have perfect sight/intel/vision of the outside of a structure without having the ability to gun it. 
---
Perhaps not an egregious exploit, but still unintended game mechanics. 
---
I would still remove the steps to recreate, the nerds in this game might still find someway to abuse this.
---
I’m saying it was unhealthy because a turn of events in game affected my rl mood.  I was invested enough in the game that being booted from my organization I was heavily invested left me feeling depressed and frustrated irl. I was upset that I got kicked from my EVE group weeks before EVE Vegas.
---
In my opinion that’s unhealthy, I’m certainly not that invested into eve (or any game) anymore where I’d care.
---
Jokes on you, most of those people in fleet are the alpha chars of our PvE guys and miners. Those toons are not older than 3 weeks and were created during CCPs skillpoint weekend event.
---
What do you mean?  
---
The major effect of this is losing two major FCs, if CCP released proof that they did indeed do it, it wouldn't make us that much worse off, but if they cannot make an adequate case, then we benefit in the public eye and possibly get them unbanned if CCP admits their evidence is weak and is honest about it.  
---
Either way, I think what Init stands to gain from a public release of the proof outweighs what it stands to lose at this point. Worst case scenario is there is damning evidence, and Init disowns them and moves on, albeit with a hurt reputation. Some risk of a failscade but that's already a possibility.  Best case scenario is much better than the worst case scenario is worse compared to the current situation of having 2 major FCs banned and reputation already declining. Plus who doesn't want to see the truth, whatever it may be?
---
It was very secret, big plays. 
---
I heard DBRB posted it to INN discord
---
Does this end with Mr. Rubal biting down on a poison capsule?
---
Just because people get organized to use a mechanic it does not mean the mechanic is balanced either.
---
&gt;Then CCP gives him the info after the fact where he's now (possibly) lied in public about not violating the NDA.
---
When did this happen?  I haven't heard anything about CCP releasing info to him or anyone else about why he got banned.    
---
Not, mind you, that I'm defending him, I'm just really curious since CCP NEVER releases info about stuff like this.
---

marmite has just merged with pirat, so pretty much all thats left of HS mercs are blue or friendly now. cowering together in fear of the upcoming HQ changes.
---
&gt; well they actually got caught.
---
They got caught by US regulators. The ones in the EU were happy to let them off the hook until the EPA went public.
---
That's ridiculously close. We need to set up a capsuleer watch.
---
The Judge is also a dick and I'm not going to defend what he did, but everything he fucked over was in game.
---
thanks very much for the appreciation. I do have fun making these, a guilty pleasure.
---
I used to be a capsuleer like you once, until I took a 1400mm to the knee.
---
To the best of my knowledge it hasn't happened yet. Was just a theoretical scenario
---
Pointer sizes got you down?
---
On the contrary, He nailed it
---
You're assuming that with no evidence though. The fact that he so closely tied his real political career to his EVE one to me suggests that he'd be much less likely than your average CSM member to do something like this for fear of something so insignificant in the real world, spilling over into the real world where it can cause much more damage.  
---
Of course none of this logic matters if Brisc is actually retarded, so that's an option, but I remain skeptical. It just doesn't make sense given how high profile the guy made himself that he would risk his actual career over space pixels, and not even for his own benefit, but for a friend's.
---
&gt;his real life political career
---
His career as a Republican and a lobbyist? Yes that means he would never do something retarded in the name of corruption
---
Ship/yield nerfs are often subject to Malcanis' law. They increase the comparative advantage gap between large and small entities.
---
Rorquals with previous yield wouldn't be a problem if they died at a sufficient rate. To ensure that anom and mobile cyno inhibation reworks were needed. But they are more complicated and controversial, and CCP likes lazymode solutions.

---
CCP's fursona
---
I'm sorry, but do you need someone to point out all the ways this game is different since 2008?  You're pretending nothing has changed around them.
---
If we had rorquals like this before skill injectors, it wouldn't matter as much because we would still have to train YEARS to put a char in a titan.
---
If we had these rorquals before citadels, we still could only have 1 titan per char.
---
If we had these rorquals before fozziesov/anoms, or moon changes, or citadels, space would change hands more quickly.
---
I'm just pointing out some of the many, many reasons (not all of which I even understand, I'll give you) that you can't just invalidate this argument because the ships have changed.  Fundamentally, this rorqual change was a nerf for small industrialists and a buff for empires that will ultimately inject 1 more character per person and keep going at the same rate.  That's it.  Spin it however you want, even telling someone they should go use exhumers is really telling them they should just give up and join a bloc, or be forced out.  To me, you shouldn't have to play a sandbox that way.  To me, it's complete bullshit to tell someone they have to play a certain way because a change the company blindly made will affect them.
---
Rorquals were designed to be powerful, defensible, independent industrial platforms, not exclusive endgame rewards for bloc players.  It's the environment of anom respawn and multiboxing, as well as injectors, that totally broke them.
---
Truth.
---
Nobody does things "in the name of corruption". You have the understanding of human psychology that a young child might have.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My point is this: whatever you think about the guy's politics or personality or whatever, a self-interested human would have less incentive in his position to do something like this than anyone else with the capability to do something like this. In ancient Rome, "cui bono", or "who benefits?" was a major underpinning question of their legal system. I just don't see how a rational human being in his position, setting aside ethics or morals and just looking purely at self interest, would take the action he is supposed to have taken, except by complete idiocy or accident. I fail to see other explanations than 1. He is an idiot 2. He did it by accident or 3. He is innocent.  
---
As for which of the three I believe, I am withholding judgment because we literally have no evidence one way or another.
---
TBH, that's basically what most of the test line members seem to think. Though sometimes without the "they work with Panfam" part. Personally; they are nearby, they are not blue and they have spaceships.
---
that's the shit you get when you mix real life politics and ingame politics... you're literally inviting the power obsessed scum of IRL world into a game and giving them power in the game, those people are not used to hearing "No", and when they are unhappy about something heads literally roll...
---
Their neutral logi is now "in corp" logi, Its good that players can now clearly see what they're up against.. except when the logi is off grid/next door or docked up, waiting to warp in. Wasn't much of a change tbh.
---
???????????
---
&gt;This might be an abusable exploit
---
you dock, your client is just desynced
---
you(r client) aren't(isn't) given any information
---
only the little guys will be switching, all the people sitting under a super umbrella are going to keep doing what they were doing.
---
Except that CCPs stated motive for this change was to help the economy.  Those little groups are such a drop in the bucket that it doesn't matter if they switch to hulks, but the big guys will just inject another account.  Point is, the change is not doing what they said it would, and is driving a dying breed of players even further into extinction.
---
Imagine being this retarded
---
The evidence could very include customer private data  ( i would be shocked if it didn't ). 
---
this means CCP releasing this is violating their customer's privacy and would personally be the day will send a formal request to CCP to remove all my data.
---
"Imagine being so retarded that you think 3 options were possible instead of the 1 that we are all told to listen and believe"

---
We literally just got it from INN chat lmao.
---
&gt;providence

---
The view outside button already exists, keep in mind your overview doesn't update.
---
I don't think CCP should release anything that violates privacy laws or concerns, but I do think they can release \*something\* that doesn't. Right now they've given us absolutely nothing, and I doubt that there is not one bit of evidence, no matter how strong, that is not tied to specific privacy concerns for individual users.
---
you seem very upset about ccp taking your briscuit away
---
The funniest thing is whenever their leadership link a battle report for the line members, they make sure to put NCPL on the side of frat, while making goons a 3rd party.
---
to be honest, half of our fleet is alpha accounts.. so no :D
---
Watch local, stay off warp in points and carry a cloak
---
People wanted to whales to be less protected, so they nerfed the panic. 
---
They wanted Rorqs to be less useful, so they nerfed the bonus for the industrial core.
---
They wanted the KMs to be shinnier, so WETUs only can hold 3 excavators forcing the Rorq to keep the other 2.
---
So now you, if you rorq mine, you risk 20x the value of a hulk and yield 1.5x it.
---
The nerf doesn't force people to spread out.
---
\-- Less shield boost from the Industrial Core
---
\-- Less time on the Panic module
---
\-- Stronger mining command boosts
---
\-- Mining drones are larger and will no longer all fit in a Wetu
---
\-- Mining drone yield decreased
---
I really dont care what they do to rorquals, I think plex and required subscriptions should be re-implemented. Sorry not sorry for the unpopular opinion, downvote me to oblivion. But the game seemed far more interesting before Pos's were effectively removed. Now these alliances just take some null sec, setup some keepstars and moon mining, and they have had zero reason to invade other regions. The game is incredibly stagnant now.
---
Find your nearest nullsec. Look around for ice belts. The ice it has is generally better, then use 2 covetors and a porpoise
---
So identical to nullsec then? 
---
Don’t pretend we haven’t had to deal with off grid or next system logo. Don’t forget, in Nullsec you can jump logo in from 7ly away hats far and beyond any subcap logi wing
---
wew
---
lol briscuit  
---
i didn't know the guy very well so I don't really care about him, but I do have some interest in this situation for the same reasons others do, and I'm not the first to point out that this whole situation doesn't make sense unless it was done by accident or Brisc has the big dumb.  
---
Also if this ended in a lawsuit, it would be bad for everyone, as resources would be diverted from game development. I think given this whole situation and how it relates to the guy's actual real world identity being tied to this, as well as the fact that this is the first time CCP has ever publicly announced a specific player's permaban, some more info about this is warranted.
---
I swear, those people should be given free eve subs.  Just imagine the salt.
---
I'm shocked how little far ahead people actually look in regards to these nerfs. Those who have a fleet of rorqs will just make more toons if they feel the new amount they mine is inadequate. Not only that but the current risk reward just encourages players to make more rorq toons to offset the time it takes to make one back.
---
As for the tank changes, we don't know how much it will truly effect losses. In short nothing changes
---
I seem to have missed something fun. Did something fun happen?
---
All true, plus you forgot "Only about six of you have ever read a CCP NDA."
---
Whoever thought it was a good idea to stick the pastebin in INN chat. Pls don't shoot the messenger.
---
I love this
---
Every time he says "NEXT"... Jesus, what a gem
---
This is pretty great. Part of me wants to say I'd admire the balls and the ruse if a friend did it to me.
---
Yes, that was what I was I was referring to. 
---
With the 'view outside' button, your ability to provide intel is extremely limited. 
---
this bug, however, can give anyone all the details about the grid even if they aren't on the gunner's list.
---
Permanently banning a multi-year player and CSM member without public explanation and presentation of evidence is completely wrong. The only reason to keep the justification and evidence a secret is to avoid public scrutiny of CCP's action. This guy has thousands of hours invested in his account. Those hours represent damages worthy of legal action.
---
A narrative is okay. A narrative that accuses a specific country/race of being evil cheaters is not.
---
Just shit talking, nothing more to see.
---
Is it just a Desync? If he stays there and doesn't relog, will he be able to use his overview as normal as ships come in or out?
---
My concern with this bug is that it can give the gunner's overview to anyone that isn't on the gunners ACL. 
---
Not an extreme exploit, but still unintended.
---
imagine struggling to believe a lobbyist would be retarded for retarded reasons
---
imagine longposting this much about it if you aren't upset
---
He disclosed his identity before he was elected to csm.  They have also provided absolutely no evidence that he actually broke the NDA.  According to their statement they are operating solely on hearsay provided by other csm members.  Did I miss anything?
---
My sentiment everytime I see you post
---
Yeah, I'd agree that this would generally fall under the 'bad narrative' umbrella.
---
No they wouldn't because they would know that running for office in a game that has 19,000 people does not make you a public figure in any way and that does not conform to any of the examples that are used in actual case law such as celebrities sports figures politicians
---
Dread farm in WH space and then go to Jita and buy ice
---
You know there's a big ass war going on right now that is producing multiple very fun fights every day, of large scale, often with T1-T2 stuff only, right?  It's not all keepstars and titans.
---
\&gt;   Is that what CCP wants? More subscriptions? 
---
Yes. That's exactly what they want.
---
In response, I sold my Rorq and dropped all of my paid subscriptions. Combined with VNI, Gila and Carrier nerfs, I, too, am on the edge of taking a break or quitting.

---

---
Now he'll never replace Brisc on the CSM.
---
I liked the part where both sides smeared shit on themselves.
---
Hello Brisc, how's it going? Any interesting leaqs?
---
"wonder how you'd react to people not being nice to you when you make sure an entire community knows you're a republican lobbyist before deciding to break an NDA"
---
oh no it's retarded
---
imagine actually caring what a site full of sperglords thinks about you
---
Me too. Very frustrating and disappointing.
---
Who cares about a few rumors between init members lol. "Most" of the communtity doesn't give a fuck and have already moved on. There is no need for CCP to dp anything more.
---
Who cares if it would pass as evidence in a real court. Its not a real court. There is no "innocent until proven guilty". Ccp is the judge jury and executioner.
---
Im kinda amazed of what INIT limemembers would believe with no evidence. You're just jumping to the conclusion that this is a mistake because he is one of your own. If this was some asshole you hated frlm another alliance, say GIGX for example, you wouldn't even ask one question regarding evidence.
---
+1 
---
Those poor ravens!
---
If they don't lay out a complete case people are gonna complain, how it doesn't proof anything. 
---
if they lay out a complete case it will likely violate people's privacy. 
---
Plus given there is a hint of legal actions going on ( as much as I don't see it happening ), that means CCP is kinda in the position now of well any information they release being used to hurt the company.
---
&gt; you can sell the spare assets at $4 a billion
---
I'm a little tired, but are you suggesting RMT?
---
You need 1 drone nav to compensate for the nerf
---
It's kinda like the plot of a porno.  Everyone knows he's not really there to fix the cable.
---
MFW I realize it wasn’t worth it.
---
without increasing mining output skill injectors wouldn't have worked
---
you would have had a bunch of people trying to buy titans that they injected the skills for but not nearly enough minerals for those titans. mineral prices would have gone up substantially
---
That damned NDA is fucking ironclad.  I *still* don't talk specifics of what I saw under the NDA I signed as AT commentator and I don't even play the damned game anymore not to mention it being 5 years ago.  Not worth it.
---
When I say public office I mean the Virginia House of Delegates, not the CSM.
---
GOP lobbyist/CSM member apparently shared things he saw under NDA with alliance mates, got permabanned for it.
---
That's not swapping mid sentence bud, that's how English works.....
---
Let's break this down.
---
Main point: You're unhappy with the Rorqual nerf.
---
Supporting points:
---
1) You've personally invested a lot on Rorquals.
---
This doesn't actually support your point. If CCP ever does let the investment by individual (or groups of) players influence balance changes, everyone would rightfully scream in horror.
---
2) Small groups cannot Rorqual mine anymore.
---
This is a fair point, but it is also inevitable due to the nature of the risk vs reward calculation. The reward side is the same for you as it is for a Goon, but you're going to be at higher risk no matter what. (Unless you're in a wormhole.) This may mean that a different mining setup is now more cost-effective for you. That's part of the game. I don't field a capital in combat because it's simply not effective for me, even though I have an alt that can fly one.
---
3) You'll quit if you don't get your way.
---
...
---
4) It's not actually a nerf, because they will still mine well and just be more vulnerable to losses.
---
You've already talked about risk vs reward, so I assume you *get* how this is a nerf and are just venting spleen.
---
5) There were better nerfs available, such as making the Rorqual require active mining. The real problem is multiboxed Rorquals.
---
Actually, I doubt the part that bothers CCP is the multiboxing. I bet it's the invulnerable nature of a Rorqual under a supercap umbrella, and how things like Locust fleets are massive ops that generate near-zero content. I bet it's the way massive scale ore mining (whoever's doing it) warps the economy, and particularly warps the economics of mineral-heavy goods like capitals. I'm speculating here, obviously, but I feel pretty confident that CCP is if anything mildly in favor of more multiboxing.
---
6) Exhumers suck, and there should be a better mainline mining ship.
---
No? Hear me out: The value of mining is directly tied to how flooded the ore market is. The more people overall mine, the less a single unit of ore is worth and the more you individually must mine in order to get a particular amount of \[isk\] reward. Exhumers may suck compared to an un-nerfed Rorqual, but nerfs to a top tier mining ship would generally be expected to reduce the amount of mining relative to other activities, resulting in the increased worth of ore, until some equilibrium is reached.
---
Regarding having a better mainline mining ship, I'm open to the idea, and CCP left themselves room for making one in the future. Introducing a mini-game like the one that hacking has would be an interesting touch. I suspect however that CCP has deliberately avoided including that sort of gameplay in mining, and they are intentionally making it the activity to lazily do while watching a movie or chatting with friends. There's clearly a market for that gameplay, and it would be likely harmful to that player base of CCP went and implicitly nerfed all "passive" mining by introducing a new top-tier active mining ship.
---
7) You can't afford a particular playstyle.
---
So don't do that playstyle. End of story. Is someone forcing you to meet an ore quota with threats of space violence?
---
Thank you
---
It's never a good time when a girlfriend steals your super...
---
/R/GATEKEEPING
---
i hope you quit over rorquals you disgusting filthy krab
---
Wrong again. I never stated that CCP was in violation of the law. My original comment on this comment thread was this ---&gt;
---
" Brisc knows what he did and why he got caught, it’s just easier to play dumb and villainize CCP. "
---
This is why lible / slander laws exist on the books. The "mob" (Aka the Public) care very little for due process / evidence / trials. They make conclusions based on literally ZERO evidence and are willing to condemn an individual based on rumors alone. Proof that humanity has not changed since the 1600s.... and Salem Trials are still possible.
---
I am simply pointing out the very reason for libel laws that we have today.... and why private companies (like CCP) should not make such information public.... unless they are willing to go to court to defend their actions of dragging a persons name through the mud (and possibly causing personal damages that such accusations can bring). I am also pointing out how mobs easily form (like you and other reddit users) to condemn a man.... based on literally ZERO evidence from CCP. Making a public statement is not evidence....
---
He's so fucked.
---
Thank you for the support! hahaha
---

---
lmfao, he doesn't want to lose it cause all the killmarks.... So we are trying to help him hahaha cause that is what good corp mates do.
---
Thanks, I went digging based on that, lots of laughs were had!
---
You are correct. CCP has every right to take actions with their personal intellectual property (Eve Online, CSM).
---
However.... publicly shaming an individual and dragging their name through the mud (thus getting the mob riled up as you can see here on the forums) is the very reason why libel laws exist. Since CCP felt it was smart to public shame an individual.... they better have evidence to bring to court that such misdeeds did indeed take place (If Brisk even decides to pursue a court case at all).
---
Brisk could very well be guilty.... I just hate seeing mobs form on any accusation.... when there is no evidence available. Brisk could be right .... or wrong. But we the people just don't know. Wild speculation is all we have.
---
So we should just get rid of the CSM? It was bad enough with all the shady shit in the background up to this point and how the 'integrity of the CSM' then turned into just backstabbing. 
---
If the CSM is built on trust how can we trust if:
---
A. Backstabbing
---
B. Continuous leaks
---
C. Bragging of all the school park dealings
---
***Real talk***
---
Honestly, the extent of people that have NDAs seems pretty fucking ridiculous. There probably needs to be some real inward reflection of the number of people with NDAs and why they need them on top of this. And seriously it needs to be NDA people cant disclose NDA shit to even other NDA people. They have the agreement with you CCP not you and 100 of your best friends. 
---
If you do keep the CSM for some odd reason, the information should be relevant to the discussion and almost not on the verge of even needing an NDA. Just a slight bump above the questionnaire you send out.
---
Brisc I feel bad for you mate I hope it isn't true.
---
lock her up
---
No, in null/low and WH space your logi can rep, non allinace coalition buddys or blues hostiles if you really want too prolong their suffering. so logi in HS is still different and spooky. Its an ok change overall, my point was only that removing neutral logi hasn't changed much, in terms of who is fighting or not like rwoj was suggesting.
---
Why would you buy that instead of 2 snakes that can actually move when fighting, and for less money?
---
"Yeah I have way more cause I'm elite and win AT".... oh wait you are in hydra, nvm.

---
Ffs you understand some parts but not the fact that the dudes who have the code (and thus do know) say that it requires more than you say.
---
Why are we even having this conversation? Either you can perform miracles, in which case fucking do it because miracles wouldn’t even require the code since they impossible acts of the divine. Or you can’t and should just admit that even if you got hired by CCP that you wouldn’t be able to do it.
---
But I did.
---
&gt; Wrong again. I never stated that CCP was in violation of the law.
---
You said that exact thing.
---
In writing. In English. In this thread. That’s some Donald Trump level dumbass denial there.

How would CCP stand to lose anything here?  They own EVERYTHING about Eve and it's a video game...

I see a lot about the huge alliances on here, but is there much life in smaller corporations and alliances outside of null?
---
You're pretty mad for a person who also plays a completely unfinished game

Not a popular opinion but Bebop is actually correct...
---
Figures of actual online accounts is sloping downwards. Current peak players is almost identical to Summer numbers of 2018.. This is also the same number of players as 2007! 
---
The real crux is going to be when the player count hits the all time lowest since 2006 maybe 2005 this summer. That will be a very sad day indeed :(
---
Thank you !! Hopefully won’t get gangked
---
&gt;  but not the fact that the dudes who have the code (and thus do know) say that it requires more than you say.
---
yeah, and they're either supremely incompetent, don't want to rewrite objectively shit code or any mix of those two to varying degrees. Unless they themselves explain why its impossible everyone who ever touched a relevant line of code will hold this same position because it makes no sense. I can't think of a single explanation for it to be impossible apart from just shit code that should be rewritten asap however so even that might not be enough.
---
&gt; Why are we even having this conversation?
---
because i've been trying to take ccp's dick off your throat, it seems however that it is stuck and I will not be playing the part of king arthur in moving the phallic excalibur.
---
RemOve The ship total
---
Just make alot bigger cargo hold on retrivers hulks skiff Mack i sted an 100% more ore income so They hit 35 40 mil hour
---
Just a bit of casual racism...
---
Don't know if it's been reported yet but now guns show even when cloaked. Pretty lame glitch ruining immersion :(
---
I mean, objectively if you look at their recruitment and mer stats over the past months the jump in titan numbers can't really be explained. Not saying that they're financing their fleet through botting but that sudden rise in titan numbers is definitely anomalous. 
---
I hear FRT's leader has deep pockets, maybe he's buying people titans or heavily subsidizing them?
---
Goons pretended to do it for a while too but got bored and left their bots alone and legacy just pretends that they have none.
---
A requirement of being a kingmaker is that you are still alive after you've made your decision. Otherwise you're the dumbass who orchestrated your own downfall.

Almost everyone in the entirety of nullsec bar Imperium hates Test. If Test turns against their current allies (Imperium), they either eat shit to Imperium, Frat+NC+Horde+SkillU+BL+GOTG, or both at the same time.

How is this guy a king of anything? [https://zkillboard.com/character/96176758/](https://zkillboard.com/character/96176758/)

A king is a single guy who rules as a monarchy. Based on his 96% gang kill, it's more like Robin Hood and his Merry Band of support fags. Might have to visit Kamela.
---
Honestly, I'm having fun with EVE. Join a smaller scale tightly knit group. Wormholes are great for that as their mechanics limit you in group size.
---
The pvp is decent, could be better of course, but if you look around you will find things to shoot. A recent patch just got dropped today and I'm looking forward to how it's going to spice things up a bit.
---
In 2004/5 CCP was discussing how they would look to implement this as soon as they could...
---
It smells like stackless python.... eeewwwww.
---
I was trying to get a capture of this. Thank you!
---
Is that actual players though or bots? Or people simply not multi-boxing? Honestly its pretty impressive that they are holding on to the same amount of people as they had over a decade ago.
---
Wars have always helped drive massive returns of players and this is evidenced to anyone who can use eve-offline.net
---
However this is down the the BLOC Leaders to end the blue donuts...
---
Well its actual accounts logged in. Only CCP Can confirm "real" clients numbers.. however these numbers that compare to 2007 are not all "paid" so if you take a further 10% off for Alpha accounts.... :/
---
I doubt the small % of eve players who use a mac are even profitable enough for CCP to worry about supporting a mac client for much longer.
---
Yes, plenty of smaller groups having lots of fun. It's a sandbox after all, EvE is what you make of it :)
---
Please bring your crystal pod again.

Ah yes I forgot we're the gud guys trying to rid the universe of the evil villainous panda bears who want to convert us to communism

ccp breaking guns a lot today
---
they should get a test server to find these things before they hit tq
---
That's almost definitely client side only. The server doesn't send information about cloaked ships to clients that can't see them.
---
I fully agree and support the ~~GSM~~ CSM.
---
Now imagine you didn't play the game, but you had signed an NDA with this guy. Would it be justice for CCP to stay silent?
---
Are you serious? Please tell me you're not that fucking stupid
---
I think to sub a month currently is around 2.1 bil. I easily plex for my 2 toons and don't grind anything. Just gotta find your niche....
---
I dont play nor have I ever played Eve, but I read stories like this from time to time.
---
I'd like to ask something to Eve players. The story described here doesn't seem too different from backstabbing amongst friends on tabletop or RPG games in the spirit of roleplaying. Why do you guys take it apparently more seriously in this game in particular? Is it due to the stakes involved (time, maybe money spent?)?

You started the war with Frat and invading them, you're in Perimeter against Horde after trying to invade them. The fuck will BL do against Legacy. GotG rather be left alone and NC. would preferably be taking care of shit in Spire. Skill U probably just likes to farm your tears. 
---
Everyone just thinks you're more cringy then even INN these days. Hate is a strong word, I mean, goons and test hated each other probably more at the time you bend the knee. 
---
Null politics are fluid and never same.
---
If Titans didn't require minerals, sure
---
But they do, and the cost of minerals would have increased with the cost of Titans, which would have increased prices throughout the markets
---
LARPing is all anyone does around here.
---
So... what you're saying is that the people of Salem probably SHOULD have believed the accusers, because at the time there might not have been any easily discerned ulterior motive for their accusations, and because the the accused had the most to gain by being dishonest, i.e., their lives? Got it. ;)

He was a close RL friend of almost 10 years who I hosted into my home numerous times. He would sneak around in my home and access my computer. Very different than "IRL counter spying". This guy didn't even play EVE except the maybe 1 month I convinced him to sub.
---
Person was a close RL friend of almost 10 years who I hosted into my home numerous times. He would sneak around in my home and access my computer. It's a little different

They are basically there to kill subs fax's or dreads while the titans brawl.

He said he posted it before but it was removed apparently.
---
Its a new feature to give people a chance to identify where cloaky campers are.
---
Correction: the Romans nailed him to it.
---
Depends on how the NDA is written, even here in the states. If CCP wanted to follow legal recourse, they'd need a tort trial, but within the realm of Eve, breaking the NDA could be considered a EULA or TOS violation, equivalent to exploitation of a known bug, and CCP is essentially god at that point.
---
It takes a special person to be like you.

I hope your parents told you were special growing up.

can a super finish the haven and arrive at the next in under 4 minutes? because if the titan's boson cooldown is up by the time their movement is complete then wouldn't that be enough? serious question as i actually don't know. all i've ever ratted in was an algos and a VNI.

I think if this subreddit gets any crueller or rougher, it's literally going to cease to exist. What I won't do is take in two banned players who could be FCs... I have been watching this ban. And I see the people. I mean, they're mean. They're mostly mean, and they're virgin men. These are physically aborted, virgin men. They look like prime-time toddlers. Now it's probably not true, but where is the evidence?... So, you ask two things. Number one, why aren't they explaining for their banning? And number two, I don't want these accusations coming over here. I will be phenomenal to Brisc. I mean, I want to help Brisc. I have a great relationship with INIT members, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I like them.
---
Mr. Rubal never made any revealing or illegal comments about CCP information... He was talking about ideas. He was allowing people to pour through the concepts, and and think about them. At times I wish I were there in Virginia more, sleeping with him in the bedroom like we used to at the shipyard, to protect him. I feel guilty that he's in there right now almost alone. Believe me, we're going to grab CCP by the wallet.

I’d be interested to know what “small group” you’re in. There aren’t really any small groups in Nullsec that aren’t aligned to a bigger power anymore.

---
&gt; Ah, Victim complex runs deep, proving the point. "Us vs rest of eve".
---
You can't say it's not the case when that was *literally* what we all did last summer. Like, are you going to point to Fountain Core and say that since they didn't show up to UALX then it wasn't "all of eve"? 
---
Sure Horde and GOTG shot each other, but aside from some alliances becoming nobodies, that's all that's really changed since then. 
---
Also, how is it a victim complex when the situation is literally one half against the other half? Those are even odds, I don't see anyone crying in the corner about it except for a couple dudes projecting on reddit.
---
No it's a well established legal principle called the TL;DR Test. That dude's used it slightly incorrectly with a colon instead of a semicolon, but the basic idea is that any legal argument that is just too damn long to read can be immediately dismissed. I believe the test was established in United States v. $124,700 in U.S. Currency.
---
The 2 players that were FC's are garbage people and don't touch them with a 10 ft pole unless you want to catch something. Brisc is cool and misses cuddling with him. Free Brisc, he did nothing wrong. Also CCP is going to regret this with incoming lawsuits.
---
Oh, bugger.
---
u/sheo_shik will you be taking that in isk or PLEX?
---
Player who think they are getting banned because they might have ownzoned a dev should probably just eat the ban and go play another game. I mean, why would they want to keep sending money to such corporation?
---
A company that he would have had to claim income from due to the trips to Iceland that were paid by CCP.   
---
And an NDA is an NDA. They are not something to scoff at. Breaking NDA's when you are receiving income from them, and doing something that (although not legal within the game) has a real life value attached to it from abusing the NDA, especially something that he himself invested real life money into (as he said, in the thousands recently).. This is very much something that a state bar would want to be made aware of at an ethics level, especially when he used his background as a lawyer and within government to get said 'job'.
---
well of course
---
They will just bring back the $75 monocle
---
I hold no grudges to you for that. I play EVE understanding the reality of the game. If I choose to play within that environment then it's to be expected, even if it never fails to disappoint me each time i've seen a supposed corp mate betray the alliance.
---
Let's look at it from the other perspective. You convinced your friend to play a game, and then instead of truly playing with him, you put him in a token group you were spying on with full intentions to fuck them over because its fun for you and because your corp/alliance was too elite for him. You then taught him the ways of spying and then got offended when he stopped his new friends from getting shit on by your friends. You literally taught him to betray people. Yeah it kinda sucks that your friend of 10 years decided to counter spy on you. But frankly you asked for it.
---
You don't have to be long 10 year friend to hurt someone or ruin their experience of the game by pretending to be a friend and then betraying them. 6 months or a year of daily contact is plenty of time to form a friendship that betraying can have RL effects on people. You just don't are or realise until it happens to you. It's fun until it happens to you
---
I agree it's shit he was accessing your computer while you were out of the room 100%. On one hand this is just a game. On the other you are interacting with real people whether you know them IRL or not. It's very easy for many people to distance themselves with the computer screen. It's one thing to spy from a distance, listen to fleets etc. It's another to befriend and betray. You were happy to put him in a situation where he was doing that, and you got a lesson in what it feels like on the other side. Instead of passing him off as a sociopath, maybe realise that your actions can have consequences to others too. I've seen a few instances over my 10+ years playing of innocent ppl getting kicked because they were framed a PL or other spy as cover. I've had a few PL spys in No.Mercy who i've befriended and felt really shitty when I found out that their friendship was fake. If you can do that to others, then you should look at yourself as much as your friend.
---
This isnt an issue. A cloaked ship doesnt broadcast its location, to avoid sniffing. 
---
Just a visual bug, was there before the patch.
---
&gt;  OP is a douche though.
---
Wait what, why?
---
And yet, nothing truly great happens without it.
---
fun fact: that one is a [real case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._$124,700_in_U.S._Currency) that I chose because the name sounds absurd.

Can confirm, module does not even have to be active. Just pre-heat, try to dock in a citadel, and your ship will cloak like you are docking, but not transfer to actually being docked. Can't do anything, have to relog.

Yeah, rorqs are not op, they are dying all the time. The real problem is the supercap umbrellas in some regions in EVE. The only solution is to make resources limited in every region, the more people crammed in one place should mean less isk for everyone.

Looks like all of the dying coalitions trying to fight test? Struggle to go along solo.

Cloak first, ask questions later.

Leaving npc wrecks lets people know you were there and active. Also the approximate location you were mining. Same with jetcans.
---
Assume everyone wants to kill you (because they do).
---
See if there are local athanors that have reprocessing facilities and ask the ownera for docking rights so you can compress your ice. 
---
When you inevitably lose some ship, don't be salty and try to make friends with locals. Also ask locals if they need some ice or fuel blocks, might be beneficial for both of you. You might offer people to bait for them.
---
Bring 3 combat drones for killing npc and wrecks and 3 ecm drones for gtfo if needed. 
---
Bring some t1 cruiser(vexor?) or even a catalyst for killing the occasional battleship spawn or clone soldier.
---
Fly safe o7

let me guess, you are filthy rich IRL and buy PLEX to sell for ISK for your PVPing needs in the game ?

People like then as they can say that they never skill injected

&gt;Once more, smallest ones gets hit the hardest because big guys can't regulate themselves / are abusing the system.
---
no, smallest ones get hit because ccp make dumb changes because they didn't stop and consider what would happen when 30000 people used a game mechanic they willingly introduced to the game.
---
blame ccp for making dumb changes, rather than blaming players for playing the game ccp give them.

You could mine forever. and hey if something comes to kill you, your drones would be totally safe \*And they are the most expensive part\*, making killing rorqs a thing just for "Fun" instead of getting anything out of it, since the loot is fucking garbo.  
---
And the absurd amounts you can tank AND dish out makes a rather damn high "you must be this stronk to ride this ride". Meaning unlike exhumers, procurers or orca's the barrier to engage in harrasment tactics or even just fucking basic level content is so damn high you need a 30+ man fleet (or a really well organised group of like 10)   
---
Oh and one more thing. the fucking rorq can use fucking mobile MJD's while also being fit with RR to be able to repair them too! and in alot of ways pretty much outperforms dreads and carriers due to tank, PANIC and drones being drones (you'll apply better than carriers and to a large extent, dreads, while having a billion fucking dronebay)  
---
All of these factors made rorqs hilariously safe, you either could not kill one when roaming, or have trouble getting a group to have the drive to go out and try. you'll get no loot from it unlike other capitals, and its very likely to cyno in more than enough to fuck your gang/fleet  
---
If they get nerfed so small groups stop using em. I'm sorry but who cares? EVE has been there before and played quite fine, small groups were not crying (oh we just cant mine enough ore REE) and this is coming from someone who was in a small alliance(if that matters at all), the problem is the sheer STUPID amount of ore that rorqs have thrown into the economy and utterly destroying any balance it had left. how blind do you have to be to not look at the MER and go (hmm. so my small alliance mined X with 2 rorqs... but IMP/FRT/Legacy have mined 10000x more.. THIS NERF IS GONNA HURT THE LITTLE GUY!!!)
---
Also  the risk/reward isnt worth it!? WOT!? i just.. wot.. my fucking brain man. your rorq shouldn't be able to fucking one-man gangs on his own, its a fucking MINING ship you drongo! you wanna protect it? eve is RIDICULOUSLY safe atm for anyone with half a damn braincell.  
---
Intel channels, citadel spam, the RIDICULOUS level of sites in any ol nullsec system, plus cyno jammers being damn near useless to anyone with 2 braincells to fire off.  
---
just goddamn, the level of carebear seems terminal at this point.  
---
Honestly. the nerf is nowhere near enough, in alot of ways rorquals are STILL better than freakin dreads or carriers, and will continue to hilariously fuck the market but thats just CCP doing the same shit they did when they overbuffed it, Too slow changes and far too late, feels like svipuls and ishtars all over again.  
---
TL/DR  
---
Rorqs are still op, Littleguy arguments are stupid, and you will keep flying the rorq cause its still the far and away best option. Also your english is probably better than mine
---

TAPI needs to feel important
---
Works for me
---
.webm doesnt work on iphones
---
\&gt;  You were only playing the game to rat and mine? 
---
LOL. Hardly. I did, however, have a lot of time, isk and SP invested in those particular ships / activities.
---
There's certainly plenty of other things to do in Eve, but I feel ripped-off and no longer trust CCP.
---
Shield timer indeed unimportant. Yet another Tapi fleet loss is a bigger deal.
---
to be fair, he also labeled a fight worth "1 million dollars"
---
"Ugh, this is hard" (c) ccp
---
which works really well, because most cloaky campers have cynos in the highs, and no guns.
---
It's a thing [they do](https://medium.com/@Gfycat/naming-conventions-97960fc40179).
---
It’s only battleships though, they too are not important, I would say that for any side
---
&gt; To me, you shouldn't have to play a sandbox that way. To me, it's complete bullshit to tell someone they have to play a certain way because a change the company blindly made will affect them.
---
Now here, that’s an argument. I’ve used it myself, for all the right reasons. Because it’s a sandbox nobody gets to decide how you play. You do what you want to.
---
Having said that, although I was [not always] in one of the big power blocks, you needed a good-sized crew for 0.0 operations. The only reason being that you need shooters who can put up a fight. Null being what it is, you can sit in a system for hours without so much as a blip on the screen. Next thing you know 600 guys are barreling through on the way to the war. It might not happen today, it can happen in the next five minutes. I’ve had that experience, being in the 600 guys crew [in Drakes!] hunting for bad guys.
---
So, I’m going to accept your argument and at the same time point out that although you *shouldn’t* have to join a big block to enjoy the high-end, you’re not going to be able to hack it alone as a small crew for any length of time. I can see you dropping an Astrahus and working from there as a perfectly reasonable way to run your small outfit. The reality of that is that at some point someone is going to claim ‘all of this is ours’, pay rent or we’ll blow up your sand castle.
---
But, I’m quite sensitive about the sandbox argument and from that perspective you’re absolutely right. The real problem is that CCP can’t introduce stuff in the game that the big blocs won’t find a way for to exploit it in large numbers. It’s an extremely difficult balancing act. Either it’s ‘a little overpowered’ and then that will be blown up by the big blocs, or it’s ‘reasonably strong’ and then the big blocs win any way because they’re the big bloc. It’s not an easy thing to do at all.
---
I cut both Satisfactory and Star Citizen some slack (though less on SC), because they aren't done yet. Eve is a mature game, and much more expensive and time consuming -- which means it could and should be held to a higher standard.
---
No I'll take 1m sp CCP
---
oh no I'm getting flashbacks to calculus
---
Its probably related to the upcoming capsuleer day event or the triglavian invasion
---
&gt;just adapt lol
---
Bring more dreads lol
---
I'll take your entire stock
---
How do you validate who's really playing where and prevent me from being a candidate with my alt and get votes?
---
na they got that shield timer in the KS, also the slaughter fest down in Eso and Paragon Soul...and the historic system from TAPI got reffed...opening the field for anyone that hates TEST to kill their entosers :)  
---
But I think TAPI is resenting since they failed to take IAS that they didnt even tried for FR46...shit...even Kids with Guns are tired of TEST lol

Low sec and WH would get representative if they didn't piss in each other's cheerios with their ballots. The voting system give them enough total votes IF they decide to put all their candidate on their ballots.
---
Well, upon hundreds of unanswered questions about this ship/citadel/whatever the hek CCP is doing
---
It has drone bay/fighter bay/ship maintenance bay/undocking ports
---
youre right it should have said, "with a small loan of one csm secret"
---
A Triglavian carrier would be interesting, but I really hope it's a dread and not a carrier because a dread would be a much better fit for Triglavians.  But knowing CCP it's gonna be a Fax lol
---
lol best post of 2019 yet
---
The weakest link is the least probable to change anything. Good look getting all those highsec players who don’t integrate anywhere to vote.
---
I'd like to call int now.
---
Soon the triglavian ship will be done and will target you upon arrival to the pocket. Knowing that we can't fight it many will leave but a few will die. Thus as the triglavian value a good fight or "proving" we will see larger tier filaments for larger ships...
---
...or maybe they just invade us
---
A trig fax with the spool-up reps would be pretty cool actually.
---
Entropic Reverser, spooling hp reps 🤮🤮🤮
---
Should make a triglavian Carrier and have it use triglavian fighters/drones
---
&gt; They didn't apply all that well
---
ok... thanks for confirming us that you are a retard..
---
No developer will ever explain to third partys reason for baning someone.
---
We got developer statement cause he was on csm.
---
They said there why was he baned, and dont expect to seeanymoreresponse from ccp on that matter.
---
If you think brisc is innocent...why were 2 more ppl banned with him then?
---
If it was only him, i would maybe belive him he didnt dip his fingers in honey...but it this scenario, his whole arms were in honey.
---
But then again, he will be back in a few months just like gigx wife or whoever plays on behalf of him lol.

Just hire a courier to do the delivery of the documents. Kinda like PushX, but for lawyers.

EVE would need to be rewritten.

Im not opposed to production of EVE 2.0

Well i won't. Since i keep agreements i sign.
---
Keep in mind the current estimated size of this "ship" is bigger than a Fortizar
---
So thats why I see railguns on dscan but not ships.
---
Til
---
Current guesswork has actually found the original size estimates for the thing were off by a factor of 10, someone scaled a model wrong.
---
That thing is not capital ship sized. It's citadel sized. Current thinking is it's a true mothership. Imagine a precursor race with true mobile station sized ships. Cityships. That thing clocks in at 20km long and ~56km wide. Astrahus is 43km wide.
---
Currently thinking it is not going to be player pilotable.
---
"leadership"
---
You're conflating the ban (fine) with being publically accused of breaching an NDA (not fine). I've explained the distinction already.
---
Correction, bigger than an Astrahus. My calculation put it at 56km wide. An Astra is 43km, Fortizar is just over 100km.

If this was someone like sort for example you would meme your ass off like the rest of us when it comes to brisc "nobody" rubarb.

it was a joke chill there defender of the imperium
---
Yeah it's possible CCP did a mistake, but I doubt they banned people like without solid evidence.
---
I did a quick search, but I couldn't find an anwser.  
---
What is the difference between stuka and goku fleets? They both look like steath bomber fleets.
---
Is that you, Mr. President?
---
Shooting suspects is possible with safety green meaning it doesn't provide suspect or criminal timers.  It does however award a limited engagement, meaning you can't receive remote assistance without the assistors gaining suspect status

Sure, myself not gonna hold my breath with that one

Im taking my bet on trig citadel, it make sense because if You want trig caps then they need to be build somewhere.
---
Also who knows, maybe trigs will invade null and take some sov from nullbears ;)
---
idk, if losing three caps and getting kicked from a space guild will help me find out that one of my rl bffs is a dickhead, i wouldn't mind it so much

You also can't lie this was a heavy blow for the alliance of INIT. Not much of spinning there.

While Brisc has been vocal about denying wrongdoing, shines and pando have been silent about the issue.

I wonder how much hate towards ccp is on their discord lol

Talk about becoming a WH alliance have already begun.

Probably started a year ago.

Yikes bud! This hits the nail on the head for me. I’ve always considered myself an excellent judge of character, in my particular profession you kind of need to be. This one blind sided me so bad that I now share your same philosophy.
---
HAIL HYDRA
---
This is strange to read.  No offense, but it seems like your friend outplayed you.  You teach him about spying ingame, enjoy the spy meta yourself, and let him watch it unfold live.  Shortly thereafter you are in disbelief that your friend spied on you in real life and fed insider information to your enemy.  Do you expect a boundary to be set where you can freely manipulate someone in a video game but should not do so in a real world setting?
---
I just want to know as I’m new to EVE but it seems like criminal activity and sociopathic tendencies are encouraged.  So it seems within the allowed scope of gameplay that this happened.
---
The cover of a great book !
---
A few parts missed - the rorqual pilot had been scouting the muninns earlier, got busy with something and forgot about his rorqs in belt until too late.
---
While rorqs are under attack, the incursion caps just keep doing sites.....
---
they are still there you just have to go do it
---
or rorquals
---
Citadel killer, you heard it here first
---
CCP finally building counter for all those structures spammed left and right across the cluster and it's introducing it with invasion of all new eden hopefully
---
I'm not surprised. CCP are pretty smart to delay this until it is absolutely ready and stable. Hell imagine it launches and everyone starts having clients issues and begin losing caps lol. All hell would break loose. 
---
GJ CCP keep it up, although I was looking forward to 64 bit sooner QQ
---
He was raging at the retards in the incursion krabbing fleet that made the call to stay on grid and fight a hundred subcaps, that couldn't tank or kill shit which forced a TEST roaming fleet of goku bombers to self-destruct and JC to save them, which then ruined the Perimeter timer because they burnt their JC and couldn't form enough for that too.
---
Yeah but people don’t really rorq mine in those areas
---
They do.
---
Don't forget the complete lack of damage mods.
---
Lol what is up with this guy! Talk about being delusional.
---
Oh shit, what did I miss?
---
You saw that too?
---
&gt; What I mean is to rework insurnce as a whole but active insurance should stay the same until it runs out or the ship gets destroyed.
---
They won't re-code the insurance system just because some edge case will happen in a limited time windows right after they changed some ship class payout calculation.
---
He's talking about the other fight there
---
Hey Stitch, don't bother with this retard. Interesting fact tho!
---
When I was leading my corporation in Amarr factional warfare probably 7-8 years ago.
---
I was immature and had an inappropriate ticker on my corporation, and we were forced to change it.
---
Right before we were forced to change our ticker, there was a major siege on one of the Amarrian core worlds known as Sahtogas, which was also our main staging system. Our corporation organized the defense, and constantly lead fleets fighting the slaves. Some of my favorite fights were had that day, including a fight where I took 20 coercers against nearly 300 minmatar frigates piecemeal in a specialized setup, and slaughtered many slaves that day by holy laser fire.
---
But I digress, We ultimately lost the system to the minmatar. 
---
One of the leaders of PiE, one of the oldest Amarr RP corps in the game, made a formal declaration about the defense of Sahtogas and handed out a bunch of "medals". 
---
My corporation was front and center, we were told to be True Amarrians because we were the "First in, and the last out" in the Defense of our home.
---
And that was what we took as our ticker.
---
FILO - First In, Last out.
---
I was always proud of the fact that our ticker came from something directly from our history, and the lore that WE created in the game.
---
And its something i'll never forget.
---
Hopefully someone decides to drop 50 supers on it
---
Seddow was running Goku and PGL didn't come into mumble on the eso shit until the very end.

---
Yup lol the whole eviction was over some groups finding a fat bloated carcass of a coalition they could tear into and extract a few final feeds from.
---
drop everyone on the current CSM.
---
and invite players who have been playing for less than 6 months.
---
with play styles, losses, and skill choices you can determind new players and alt accounts?
---
with newer players on the CSM, they will be your way of truely getting the fixes done to the game reguarding starting off in eve.
---
they will be less likely to be in FC or CEO positions and not affiliated with anyone 100%.
---
 just an idea

Again....keep drinking the kool aid...does PGL gets mad at you guys for not commenting on reddit or something? you guys seem pretty mad all the time...

Spot on.

That’s not true at all. Saying an umbrella is imbalanced is completely false. Everyone else in the EVE galaxy has access to the same tools as Goons or Test or anyone else who has an umbrella. Umbrellas are not unbalanced. Anyone can use them. Just because someone chooses not to use an umbrella does not mean that those that use one are at an advantage. It’s not an advantage if anyone can do it. It’s just smart.

INB4 fleet filament for 10 ish people.
---
Nah, the larger one was the proper size - I had originally mis-scaled it to the size of about a Dreadnought, but it turned out it was far bigger than I had mistakenly assumed.
---
CCP don't pay the bills any more, Pearl Abyss do. CCP is just the most expensive, most remote office in their portfolio. So regardless of the circumstances of the ban, nobody apparently stopped to consider the reputational consequences to Pearl Abyss and how that would be viewed by their shareholders if there was significant negative press - instead preferring to wade in with the usual knuckle scraping caveman approach to customer care.
---
Not yet. We re getting there...
---
It would make sense for a triglavian citadel to have triglavian defenses
---
ISK invested to DPS and tank is pretty good for supers on paper but yeah it falls apart the moment tidi hits. Which super blobs are also going to bring with them wherever they go because ~fighters~.
---
When I was still really new at the game, I decided to take a break from space trucking Npc commodities around lowsec to go looking for relics and data sites in a wormhole. At the time I didn’t know how to set bookmarks, and I ended up lost in space for almost a week before finding my way out. It was nerve wracking, but in the end I made it out with the loot.

Well, on the other hand they have parameters from which they could consider specific amounts of ISKs "illicit". Sounds like they re actually knowing what they re doing for once.

Been gone for a while any where i can read about this to catch up?

&gt; a guilty pleasure.

You want to stop with the guilt. This is fucking beautiful. I would be rude with bragging if I could do this.

Keep doing that, it’s wonderful.

Have you filed a bug report and can you post it or PM it to me, thanks.
---
When I began this game it was shortly before WWB, I was ratting in my cute rattlesnake when war escalated around where I lived (Tenal, was in Razor).
---
I was joining fleet with my griffin because it was the only doctrine ship I could use.. but as a healer in any game I play, my eyes got caught quickly on Logistic ship. for a month I was doing rattle ratting all the day, only stopping for Strat fleet. The idea at that time was to get enough money to buy skill injector and quickly inject Basilisk skill, within a month I had the skill for it and was already flying in fleets with it, making the chain of love all around the place, I was quickly the top logi pap of Razor during a very though moment.
---
Oh and what I'm less proud is, in Razor we had isk for the most pap maker, and logi were x2 reward xD
---
Well, they only "defamed" his ingame toon, which is perma-banned anyways aaaand has never been really "HIS". Since all teh toons in EVE actually still are CCPs belongings they can defame those all they like, as far as I can see.
---
 Don't forget to say hello to Gigx
---
Hey, my bad! Meant to fix drones not giving the player an 'asteroid depleted' message when it depletes an asteroid. Through quite a strange chain of events this broke as a result. Fix is coming asap :)

👌
---
There is something under construction of Triglavian origin in Abysall space and people are speculating what could it be since it's massive but not Keepstar size.
---
TIL
---
Well, what should the US do against CCP? Send some carriers and Marines to that lil island cause some 4th row Lobby-guy got butthurt bout space-pixels?
---
it lit a cyno foir a fax wing
---
invade us how? all the empires match them in strength right? 
---
worst they can do is occupy some pockets of nullsec
---
Long story short.  
---
If you are new, skill injectors are better.
---
The more SP you have, the better Accelerators get. Especially the ones that last like 96h or more from events.
---
A player can fly their ship here and watch this in real time? Do people think this is a PVE addition to the game or a new ship for players?
---
Ramping damage on attacks. and then for a fun spin, ramping remote reps. Because no way in hell are combat fighters ever going to be given smartbombs or neuts.
---
POS code
---
Are non-cloaking guns your biggest problem in that case?
---
I don't know. Dont own a super. But have boson ratted with rapid 4. There was downtime waiting for the boson cooldown. 
---
This guy claims 2.5 min so warping to the next site doesn't take more then 30 seconds in a ratting fit hel. So that makes 3 min. 
---
Essentially it's faster then. But I doubt a hel can do 3min sites myself.
---
I personally want less rorqs in space and more content.  
---
AND having the rorq return to its original role - industry support/boost ship.
---
Don't be a miner
---
gigx should have made like Mitani, public apologize directly, he could be here if he has done it.
---
Doesn't matter, as long as he's known both IRL and in-game, imagine some hotshot politician or president playing Eve because he likes it, then accused he breached the CSM NDA. it will impact his credibility IRL . Even he's just lobbyist , the people that he works for might not trust him again for his services, specially in this confidential matter. That's why this needs to be transparent and he should have the right to defense. It's not like me and you being thrown out of the game and CSM, and then we can change nicknames and go play WoW. nobody will give a shit as we have other jobs IRL and people do not know us for playing this game from google, but only if we choose to tell them.
---
No bubbles tho so that sucks
---
You think so? Maybe he tricked them by not letting them know, that VNI's and carriers got nerfed yesterday ... suddenly not so fair trade anymore. :D
---
Too busy restocking their bots with drones and fighters.
---
maybe they can call it singularity? seems like a fitting name
---
Yeah and that's all his fault he brought it upon himself and deserves the Shit, play stupid games win stupid prizes
---
BRISC TELL US WHAT THIS IS
---
regular gfx card + added 3D render card - those were the days...
---
Not much to recode. Just let two systems Run side by side for 3 months. Your ship gets an Identifikation code for the type of insurance. Done
---
Is this technology anything like the Nintendo 64?
---
Mr Hyde fucked or Brisc Rubal fucked?

Would be awesome to some point get a lil write up explaining the chain of events, if it was possible :D Give more insight into how unrelated things can cause such odd issues &lt;3 Keep up the awesome work :D &lt;3

Where's the feedback for a terrible design if it's intended? I'm not after amazing graphics in the station hangar, or even in space.. After like ten accounts the graphics are kinda irrelevant. I also like to think that in an era where we have infinite energy and whatnot that we can just turn on a lot of lights

I made/released the first video of a titan on the live server. Was in ASCN when Steve was launched, flew down in my Stabber, opened up Fraps and grabbed footage. Quick edit and uploaded to the forums. Someone then downloaded it and put it on youtube where it got about 150k views gradually.  Also back in the day, before titans were released on live, made a calculator/spreadsheet for them and winged it to Cyvok, who said it was better than the one he had. Good old days of there  not being any EVE tools or similar, or ways to access data.
---
I thought CCP made it pretty clear, Brisc got permanently banned for leaking confidential information and facilitating insider trading
---
That’d be a feature!
---
Is this thing changing in real time or do they swap the model for a more complete model during downtime? I'm curious if it's a very long animation or something else.
---
Only two things really. One is funny and the other is just mean.

I was sitting in Jita with my corp as we were buying stuff to meme on some people who had wardec'd us. We were bored as we were waiting for a few people who were doing one thing or another. I got bored of sitting there so I decided to do something i hadnt seen in local. "Risk Equals Isk, I'll Halve Your Isk" I got a few corp mates to laugh at it, and I asked for some testimonials to spice it up. Threw what they said in my bio and started off in local. I think i only made 5m off it but i was fun watching people in local be like "Whoa thanks for halving my isk!" or be like "scam! he'll keep it". 
---
The other was at some point someone left our wormhole corp in a rather....loud manner burning a lot of bridges on the way out. A while later we found out he was in another WH group and with the grudges that a few vocal people had and the fact that we wanted to revenge a plan was set in motion. I was vocal about how i didnt like the direction we were going and was recruited by our ex memeber and brought in to help some of the newer players get used to live in J space. At some point I was given roles that included access to the stick. (POS were still a thing) A few days later my group was a nice chain to the target groups LS hole. A few people are running sites and I volunteered for hole duty. I watched my corp came in with Blops battleships and started to gank the people running sites. They warped to the POS and laughed because they were safe. Only none of them but me had roles to gun the thing. My corp lands right on the sitck and i flipped the switch. They didnt realize the shield was down till one started taking damage. We went scorched earth on that group.

I should play eve again...

Our only narrative for DRF removal was StarFleetCommander telling us that all the infrastructure we're gonna need to sit here for a while is now set up, go and have fun. No organized fleets unless our shit got attacked and we just did stuff with friends. We only entosised stuff because they'd form some crap to defend it which we could then kill. Eventually they stopped forming so we kept entosising to try and get them to form again. Suddenly we had a bunch of sov. Our view of fun didn't align with DRF and they decided to move out.
---
You absolutely will get ganked, the trick is earning enough money that its still worth it.
---
Oh no no,. Jintan set us on the correct path that we must continue to walk as he preaches the proper path elsewhere in New Eden.
---
Yup, they do. I'm assuming this is fairly standard for NDAs though.
---
I remember reporting that a few months ago
---
If you dislike the new look, I would suggest posting in the [April 2019 Release - General Feedback](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/april-2019-release-general-feedback/151526) thread on the Eve forums.  While there's a lot of subjectivity to this kind of thing, we do listen to and often act on feedback.
---
One other thing:  The new hangars include a lighting rig for your ship that should adjust to the size of the ship you're in.  If you are in a ship that's at either extreme of the size range and experience weird results, please bug report that, with a screenshot so that we can check whether it's intended.
---
I was thinking of living in a single WH for an extended period of time. What are some of the things I should be looking for before deciding which WH I should live in?
---
Yes, I real mothership. Jump capable on its own, no cyno required ;)
---
Yes
---
Good cuz i intend to use my power as a lawyer specialized in TEXAS LAW.
---
Come on Marauder filaments!
---
Yes. Ratting supers align while ratting so align time isn't a factor and they fit hypers to warp super fast. Ratting titans will fit hypers as well, but to answer your question; yes, they will do that in under 4 minutes.
---
Sounds more like an attempt to scare CCP: "Do you have any idea who are you banning here? I am US politician! I know *people*! I am a lawyer!"
---
Think they plan to invade the Sansha and do battle with the Drifters. So doubt they will be trivalgan incursions.
---
I'm expecting a new form of PVE/PVP content to come out of their final stage. Battleship Abyssals perhaps and hopefully something in New Eden.
---
It's just a matter of finding a system they can't be arsed to defend at the edge of an overextended bloc's space, settle down, provide some good quality content and hope you either don't get noticed or have your structures left alone because you entertain the blob. At this point you may even get a renting offer at a very good price.
---
Source: have snagged some sov from NC./Kadeshi/Gclub with a 20 man ally back in 2015.
---
This is 99% client side, bj0rn b33 tested this on his stream and it didnt seem to show to anyone else.
---
You claimed that CCP broke the law.
---
&gt;" It’s not CCPs job to prove to you that he’s guilty either.  "  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;When  you spread libel.... it is. Publicly shaming / attacking an  individual... is the very definition of libel if you can not back up  your written claims.
---
You actually said that they spread libel. However I don't know the exact text about libel in Iceland, but in Hungary if what you said is true, then it is not an offense.
---
So until Brisc not go to court, and say "it is not true", CCP don't need to prove anything. And IF they not able to prove it, they still not required to give their wanabe proof to the public. All they would have to do is make a statement, that they was wrong when they said he broke the contract.
---
Brisc will go to court only if he is 100% innocent. But you can imagine that CCP would do a public statement if they have nothing on him? Brisc went to public, what is a joke, however I understand that he do it to try to defend his job. I am also understand, that he try to get anything about why he got cought exactly, so there would be something, to argue with. And until then of course he not say anything else just "i did nothing". He is a lawyer too, so he not want to destroy anything for his defens in the future.
---
It's likely both, we can fly Triglavian ships after all, and the capital ship is showing up in Abyssal Deadspace, a PvE area.
---
or sabres bubbling the whole damn fleet
---
I don't give a fuck about TAPI or horde or any of you weirdo kspacers (wormholer btw) but just have to pop up n note that you seem pretty insistent that PGL was FCing a fleet he wasn't FCing, and it's actually you who appears to be drinking kool aid. Sorry to break it to ya.

fighters apply better than ANY ship in the game. this to nearly EVERYTHING. they go faster than most of the fast kiting ships while applying PERFECTLY. on top of that their tacklefighters go fucking 8km/s out to 4000km while locking instantly.
---
like holy fuck. how can you not see that stuff like this has to get changed. i mean its fucking obvious if CARRIERS ONLINE is the case. Carriers shouldnt be the answer to EVERYTHING that roams through your space.

the only thing you are concerned off are your fucking ratting ticks and your safety. risk averse ppl like you are killing the game, not balance changes that are desperately needed.

Truth has been told
---
Right after the big assault frigate rebalance a while back where the retribution got its second midslot, i was roaming around catch in my AB pulse retri and managed to snag a MWD nano vagabond and solo kill it. The vaga had a neut and my retri was slower without the AB but did not have cap to run the local rep, AB and guns while neuted. Those ten minutes were a delicate dance to keep point, rep up, pulse the AB to keep up with the vaga, while trying not to run out of cap. I think i averaged 10% cap at all times and he did not get away.
---
It was glorious

I've been out of EVE for years. What/who are Triglavians? Did they add another race?

Oh wow I remember this event. I was one of the dictors tackling him and we had everything ready to drop when suddenly they called it off for some reason. Iirc we were just bashing it with T3Cs until it got to low armor and then they lit the cyno at a ping and brought shit in to save it because GOTG wasn't going for the bait. Nice to finally know the background behind this.
---
Man I'm jealous, I've just moved out of Korea from being there for three years.
---
Nah brah...but got a dil doh for ya
---
They really are, but please CCP give us some really high resolution textures (and models) so that they don't feel like toy ships and kind of represents the scale of them. And do that for stations as well.  :D
---
Yeah, it was Lee Adama, who became a lawyer midway through the series.
---
Jokes on you, its actually a Triglavian mining ship for ~~EVE~~ Mining Online
---
Have I ever said he was FCing?? And yes he was at the Perimeter fight....I mean to be a wormholer you seem to care alot about what happens outside of your shithole you call home...go back crawling to where you came from :)

Triglavian Mining Drill Platform.
---
I just re-subbed to EVE a few days ago.  I've been using the same character since 2009 so I started a new one and started him out in Caldari space this time.  The graphics and sound have improved so much from the original days, this game is really in a class of its own.  I'm doing a new series of videos for my YouTube chan, I should have a new one done today of the fireworks celebration in Jita last night
---
Cheers
---
I'd personally settle for medium settings being the old, bright hangar. Not that bitching St you helps, but oh well.
---
Please elaborate.
---
You think they'll let me back in tho?
---
Triglavians are *very* newly discovered "precursors" who hate the drifters and the sansha and aren't all that fond of rogue drones.
---
They invited us into their super secret time-dilated spaces to "prove" ourselves (think something like greater rifts out of diablo 3, or mythic dungeons out of wow), and the rewards for that can be blueprints for their ships. Which is a whole new "main" line of frigate -&gt; battleship with t2 variants being worked on.
---
They currently aren't a selectable race for player creation, but it *is* speculated that if they were to leave their time-dilated space to make a "fifth empire" they might possess the diversity of options between the svarog, the perun and the veles clades.
---
I'm just here for the drama. You getting all upset about it is definitely a plus too though :)

skill up bro

It‘s official boys, mining is bad for the game. :)

Thats a super awesome ticker, with that story.

TEST took a fight and gave everyone involved content? psh what losers
---
Mastermind CCP banning Briscal to distract from the 64-bit client delay
---
Why are they building something like that? I mean, plot wise, what do they need a capital ship for?
---
So there's a lot going on in this scene, apart from the obvious 'Michael being a maritime lawyer'.
---
Buster is on the right in the dock, with a hook for a hand.  In the series his hand gets bitten off by a 'loose seal' and gets replaced with a hook.
---
The seal above the judge falls down, so it's a 'loose seal'.

Shame about season 5....

Is that going to be as dissapoiting as the big secret within the drifter wormholes, that "somehow" no one has solved yet?

I wonder if that and noraus accounts being banned are related?

likely story
---
It was nicely written and good advice. Thank you
---
And it is like that fir 2 years. Hello from the future.
---
This feeling when PanFam celebrates BS Kills ;(
---
Plot Twist, PanFam will set Frat blue, and starts an Invasion into INIT Territory.
---
It seems he had no access to the usual 10 Neutral Spider RR Nestors.
---
Plot Twist, not the Power of Rorquals made us strong, it's our pure numbers and autism. Now everyone outside of Delve gets hit by the nerf, while Delve still rakes in the biggest amount of Ore. GG
---
But lost three in Esoteria and 4 caps in Paragon Soul (almost a Nyx).  Guess everyone didn’t come to the CTA and krabbed instead...
---
Look Olmeca, that's how a short bragging about accomplished things in Delve looks like. Of course, if you dont suffer of Dunning Kruger.
---
I think it's a lot simpler than that. Brisc was probably in close contact with someone from INIT he thought he could trust to get their additional input. I think this still undermines the CSM in the same way the US President's spouse can. 
---
Anyway turns out that guy wasn't as trustworthy as was originally thought and here we are.
---
Or an option to buy SP from the NES store when the korean deal with CCP ends and they get their paycheck for the right number of subs/active players/whatever and finally throw the game down the P2W drain...
---
Would be dope if all citadels had actual construction "progress" with like scaffolding and being able to see the inner structure.
---
close your eyes and it'll be like the ship isn't even there.
---
Jesus Test's leaders are so illiterate and make no logical sense. Like stop!
---
If anyone can find and unstealth a ship that way deservs the price inside
---
It's not a ship, you see those numerous [X][X][X][X] to the left of the huge glowing orb, Citadels have shit like that, it's a Fortizar reskin...
---
is it just a visual bug on your client or are the guns visible for other people on grid with you??
---
a stuka fleet is essentially just a goku fleet with booshers for mobility
---
RR Abaddons, it was so glorious.
---
nope
---
yup it most likely is just a fortizar reskin, perhaps a new "NPC Sotiyo" like the ones we already have just Triglavian themed...
---
2 guys in my fleet last night had a bug where they dc'd but couldn't log back in on that character. Their ships didn't disappear from space and their names stayed in local chat. They logged into other accounts without issue.
---
  
---
Logging onto a different character on the same account and then back into the bugged one sorted it. Dunno if it's related to the patch but I've never seen that before. But reports were submitted
---
Playing for about a month now, got my first PVP kill few days back - ganked an Orca while flying a Heron, using 3 Warrior I drones.   
---
Well, fine, I've done 1% of the damage to it - after stumbling upon her with a suspect tag, already under attack in high sec, but it's dead, so that's what counts. Let's just say I tipped the scales.
---
Well if CCP will be not able to 100% prove that Brisc did "something bad" **and** that he wanted to do it - Pearl Abyss will end up with a huge legal battle in USA with a huge fine to Brisc if they lose.
---
The Siege Module II now shows a High Angle Turret Weapon Bonus of 2x, befor 2%. So there is that. Other than that im not sure if this is funny or sad.
---
assigning keyboard shortcuts had implemented same retarded logic, it took them just 15 years to fix.

---
mfw realise I'm orbiting the gate and shooting it. no one noticed
---
I don't think CCP acted without their own investigation/evidence. Especially with an execution this public they must have proof. If they were not sure about the situation but wanted to ban him they would have done so quietly. And Brisc said he knew what it was about after finding out the third person to be banned. So he must have done something that could get him in trouble.
---
Wait... They arent already?
---
We already have a thread for armchair lawyering, let's not start another one.
---
a US Lobbyist wasn't as trustworthy, I'm sorry what galaxy do we live in? since when are Lobbyists trustworthy? or US politicians in general...
---
i'm sorry sir, i'm writing a book and be happy to know how does it feel when you completely incompetent at job you paid for? Not asking directly you , but you could ask your colleagues and share with me their experience.
---
have a good day
---
And siege stacking penalty is still there as well
---
It was for account sharing. If it was rmt hed be perma banned on all accounts. Its only the account he shared.
---
So you re sayin the evemails are hilarious?
---
I would say there are three possible scenarios in this situation:
---
1) CCP have watertight evidence that Brisc spoke to people outside of the CSM about matters under NDA - however well intentioned - and there also exists no evidence that any other member of the CSM has spoken to people not covered by the NDA about CSM matters - whether to get exert feedback or not.
---
2) Brisc spoke with subject matter experts outside the CSM about ideas that came up. Other CSM members did also but the players they spoke to respected the accepted convention that you don't metagame CCP. CCP are therefore punishing Brisc because other players took advantage of him, not because he broke the NDA.
---
3) Brisc is an idiot and decided to risk his real-world job for a few more spacebucks.
---
Which you are correct that breaking an NDA should lead to a ban, if option 2 is true, by banning Brisc CCP have singled him out when other CSM members have also potentially broken NDA as well which is what I was getting at.
---
With all the moving parts required for that to be true, I doubt it's the case. I would imagine it's option 1 based off of everything that we have heard and that Brisc didn't ask the question "What is the problem with X?" or "Tell me everything you know about X" but instead asked "What would happen to X if Y happened?" or "What impact would Y have on X area" which are very similar questions but the last two breach NDA. I can then imagine 2 people who have a lot less to lose than Brisc taking advantage of the information he gave them by asking the wrong question for the NDA despite being the right question to ask for the CSM.
---
**TL;DR - Brisc tried to get expert advice to improve the game in a way that lead to him breaking NDA. Others took advantage of it. All are right to be banned as long as CCP hasn't turned a blind eye to any other NDA breaches - good intentioned or not - by the CSM.
---
Yeah bring T3 Destroyer for Combat Scanner,
---
bring Assault Frigates for "hard tackle" since they're less likely to die ^(lol),
---
bring logistics frigates obviously,
---
bring 'Sabres' for Bubbles,
---
bring Command Destroyers for booshs ^(mostly offensive ones tho, so Minmatar or Gallente) and boosts,
---
bring an Instahlock Interceptor as well as Stealthbombers,
---
bring a 'Kitsune' Caldari Electronic Attack Ship for bullshit ECM.
---
Just look at every Empires first two shiptrees and mabye at some Pirate frigates too.
---
I mean looking back at his campaign as a US resident is huge cringe and a huge red flag tbh.
---
Stopped reading after pandemic legion.
---
Bob is on no ones side, heathen!
---
Took control of a moon + POCOs in Muvolailen (Next door to Jita) back when they were relatively new.
---
The POCOs provided a cool few billion over the months we held them, and the moon several times that as we learned how to become industry scumlords.
---
Mothership hype!

I think ProGodLegend is using quality recreational pharmaceuticals. It must be fun to have such easy access to metamphetamines and related drugs.

I used to Plex my accounts in binges.
---
Plex the 3 accounts for like 3-4 months and then not worry about it for a while. I even plexed them all for a year once, but that was back when plex was under a bil a piece.
---
But That was me running complexes in fountain unhindered with a t3 prober and 2 remote repping sins that I would cyno in and assign drones to the t3. Super efficient setup back then. I could also refit the sins for PVP and drop on other complexe runners or unsuspecting targets.
---
Brilliant strategy! Reap that sweet karma mate!
---
if only you could put them all together in a single video instead of splitting them up in 6 1-4min vids...
---
Just checked the thread about this leak and we narrowed it down to 4 mainly you, we pulled trigger and undid it because it's too :strange: Grath did help with his obvious Grath self
---
&gt; Yea, and you'd be hard pressed to get me to ever call a Cop 'chill' in most instances but after spending most of the weekend with him and his wife it would really be strange.
---
Some of the securities we had pointed to you as the leak, in the end I guess it was you ;)
---
Also love the story about the break in and it was a corp mates house :D
---
It's floppy btw
---
Good point
---
Swing and a miss.
---
I don't play Eve, but holy hell is it interesting to hear about occasionally. As for my position here, I have no evidence to confirm whether or not you've done what you've been accused of. Your profession makes me automatically biased, but I have nothing but gut feelings to go on. My hope is that if you are innocent or truly guilty of what you've been accused of, the proper action will follow. I also hope this was an elaborate scheme by some other players to cause trouble, because that's oh so much more interesting.
---
This does not affect gameplay in any way, quit being a retard
---
Hey first time we've seen PL undock in like 8 months. so theres that
---
I'd pay plex for that
---
Please let it be unaffected by damage caps.
---
My nag stll gets 300dps less then it did before the patch, they really suck at this.
---
Could be just new pve stuff that invomves structure bashing
---
Not aware of a browser based one but neocom2 on ios does it
---
&gt;stop being European
---
Well. There’s the Neocom app if you don’t mind ads or paying $10/month for it.
---
Really annoying when the first one was a $10 unlock and now it’s a monthly subscription that cost as much as eve. For some fuckboy who only updates his code to make more money.
---
You'd think they'd test this first to make sure it works

Legally speaking, you’re not allowed to stop him posting here, please see clause 11 of the shitposting treaty of 07

---
I said flash angry mobs are the reason why libel laws exist in the world. People are so quick to move to judgement. The other poster then began swearing / yelling about Trump / getting heated. I was merely defending the reasoning for libel laws.
---
If Brisc is innocent, CCP would be forced to publicly admit to the player base that they were wrong about him. That would be damaging enough for CCP.... knowing that their "judgements" are not to be trusted.
---
IF Brisc is guilty, then his reputation deserves the tarnish it has gotten.
---
You are correct.... all this is based on &gt;&gt;&gt;IF&lt;&lt;&lt; Brisc even decides or wants to take this to court.
---
You are losing the narrative now... and your internal rage is showing through.
---
What does Trump have to do with anything in this discussion?
---
OK 
---
https://i.imgur.com/KZe6zQE.png
---
still better than the ~1b battlereports that get posted every now and then by dinobrains
---
What is really interesting, is the probability of an invasion. Because CCP might use it as a tool against capital proliferation. If the triglavians were to launch a large scale invasion in null, the big boys might have to come together in defending against this threat. What's more important is that they'll lose a **lot** of caps while doing it. Combined with the yield nerfs for Rorqs this might lead to a more manageable amount of caps. Maybe they could even let that invasion scale with the "power" of the entity holding the space?
---
imagine being a brisc apologist
---
The HAW dread insta win button needed to be fixed.  It was the biggest problem in this game and I for one and glad CCP tackled this pressing issue
---
No they won't
---
Dear Lawyer, I have a PhD in a real academic field, and let me just say... just because you memorized some technical jargon, I have really bad news for you... on a whole, actual attorneys are not very smart, and is does not actually make you smart because you know some, what is essentially industry specific, words.
---
I doubt they would have banned lightly a CSM member over some half-assed accusations.
---
That's what I call some tight coupling
---
What do you want to do ? PvP ? Farming ? Bit of both ? You want to achieve this alone or not ? How is your SP ? How many alt do you have ?
---
First, you can entirely play without without dedicating a lot of time to it, although it's much easier once you're experienced with it.
---
If you're interested in data analytics, market trading should be interesting, or maybe industry.
---
_knock knock_  
---
hey dude i hear you have a strat op coming up
---
Will the diminishing returns on reps alter that calculation? As in make it viable to actually out dps the reps instead of having to alpha through them.
---
Or will super's damage still be too low to have an impact?
---
I "FCd" our first match in AT6 and we won without firing a shot.
---
Then maybe idk he shouldn’t have fucking broken a binding NDA?  Just a thought?
---
While not browser-based, EVEMon among other things allows you to view your market orders and transactions.
---
I agree, grinding to me is something you do repeatedly despite not enjoying it simply because you have to do it.
---
I used to run complexes or lvl 4 missions for isk and enjoyed it quite a bit. The complexes provided PVE and the possibility of PVP encounters.
---
Running lvl 4s in NPC null was pretty safe but trying to beat your own best times and optimising your ship/fit for best efficiency was like a personal challenge.
---
There are a lot of possible scenarios. But I think instead of "goons betrayed their own", it is equally likely that Sort or Killah fabricated evidence to prevent another attack on the north. And my favorite theory is TheJudge being a sleeper agent for gigX all along and now delivering a striking blow as payback.
---
But who really knows? :tinfoil:
---
Entosis molok?
---
Please give a bit of detail on how the two were linked! It would be super interesting!
---
I think they’ve been completely correct on how it’s been handled.  Brisc is on at least one podcast where his participation on the CSM is frequently touted.  He’s very vocal and outspoken on all of the eve media.  People need to know the guy done fucked up and is no longer on that committee.   If it was a quiet hush hush it could be confusing.   
---
Further, it’s not CCP fault that brisc ties the two worlds together.  That’s like number one rule of these games is never never doxx yourself.
---
I’m pretty sure Test started this war, actually. I don’t see Frt reinforcing ihubs in TAPI space and losing 150 bil trying to destroy them

Boy am I glad that we have /u/StainGuy on-hand to provide insight based on his years of experience in the field of law.
---
Oh wait...
---
This is not the US court system. They don't need "beyond a reasonable doubt", they also don't need to publish their evidence unless it's subpoenaed by a court. And, proving that it was intentional is totally unnecessary, if he asked dark shines what he thought about the corax buff and then dark shines bought thousands of coraxes without that being brisc's plan, CCP would still be completely justified in banning the two of them. Honestly, even if he shared a screenshot of an enemy fleet he was scouting and there was a CSM only channel with NDA info open on screen and dark shines or Pando acted on that information it would still be breaking the NDA. Stupidity doesn't necessarily excuse the crime.
---
did you miss the part where their strat op fc called out the fc for taking the fight? :P
---
As I live in Europe I have to say that this is a very good insult and true, to give it added spice he should say a European politician, worst scum on the planet, even the Chinese have contempt for them, with the biggest insult being White Socialist...
---
800 dps what the fuck is this shit.
---
TAPI are big bois, they can handle it.
---
You’re such a knob polisher. 
---
1- CCP has lawyers and they know the fights the take. 
---
2- brisc made his own personal choice to tie his professional life to this
---
3-CCP concludes after an investigation that originated from the CSM.  
---
Try to keep up

After reading that I get the impression that PenifSMASH and Gobbins are complete dimwits.

&gt;@Gobbins \[HORDE\] same people that wonder how Americans fall for FOX News propaganda are the same ones that eat up updates like the one they posted :joy:

I don't think I saw Fox news fall for this false Russia thing but the rest of the US media did, so he could not be more wrong if he tried.
---
Now you can watch just the part you want :)
---
Especially when you don't listen to the FC and refit to EM hardeners. So many Mails were kin/therm with a whopping 37% EM resistance. 108k EHP to multi-freq. It was like slicing through butter.
---
I would honestly be content with getting to upgrade our munnin logi to scimis, I am sick of these shitty kirins.
---
But [CCP Goliath](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bb71zo/psa_new_siege_module_rapid_torpedo_weapon_bonus/ekgrt3c/?context=3) told us this would be fixed today!
---
Oh wait, it's CCP.
---
First amendment rights!  Even for shitstainguy
---
I actually don't, can you link?
---
I agree, it is a joke that this can be done to a group of thousands of players without so much as a shred of evidence or a single specific claim.
---
If only they had some kind of test server to test stuff on.
---
Camping a gate for 18 hours solid. This was back in circa 2005 maybe. We were in carriers 200km off with drones attacking the gate (to keep them there). Enemy jumped in at the end, node had a fit, they all pretty much decloaked before loading and we killed them all. Good times.
---
We don't know much about the Triglavian Collective's fleet power, but to be honest it was teased pretty much everywhere the capital ship currently under construction was a Dreadnought...   
---
Maybe they have a different concept of what is a Dread, but I doubt it since most likely this ship will be available to capsuleers at some point. However, a single dread (or even a fleet of triglavians dreads) is NOTHING for the empire to fight off...
---
The Amarr Navy already have enough titans to oneshot it, and the empires also have the Iapetan Titans, which can just crush any capsuleer force today. So a single capital is way too flimsy to attack the empires
---
Triglavian invasion of Delve coming soon to a live server near you.

Yup, those docking lights make me think of those we can see on Astrahus citadels...

But on the other side, carriers and supercarriers also have those docking shields, for their fighter bays.

If you cant mount a token defense you really didnt deserve to have it anyway.

I was really proud of the job I did fueling our POS stations, jump bridges and negotiating the transfer of our Customs Offices when we moved to recoup the money we spent on them.
---
I also felt really proud of the time I fought a Garmur in a Merlin and won!
---
&gt;Killah fabricated evidence
---
It kinda does make sense, it's a known fact NC does have CCP devs in their corps, could easily have manipulated data.  Whatever happened to CCP T20?
---
Just about every ship model at the moment has the drone bay dock shields, so I don't think that confirms it either way yet.
---
I guess we need to wait and see tbh, all we have at the moment is a graphical model and some leaked videos showing what are schematics. I suspect they will start giving out more breadcrumbs of information leading up to the next EVE Invasion event when there will be a reveal.
---
I read that as wheelchair and thought that would be a relatively small demographic.
---
Imagine that fucker spooling up on citadels
---
Haven't had epic moments in 8 years. Back then we built and used our first capitals and titan as a Corp, and generally owned our section of null. Lots of fun times. Now I'm an on/off again carebear 😔
---
Kirins are fine.... just not for HACs
---
It will just reach through space and a puny titan blob to itself.
---
Still in Warrior Nation OP? I was with that clan 12 years ago... Looong time ago (dawn of war)
---
I am proud of that time that CCP T20 spawned those tech 2 BPOs for bob, or that time CCP tried to ban the bonus room scam victims, or that time CCP threatened to take 'legal action' against its player base, or all of those times CCP banned people without sharing with them the rationale for the bans, or that time CCP had to walk back Incarna, or that time that CCP changed HAW torp launchers and fucked up the change and the hotfix...

im not interested in these kind of vids anyways. splitting them up definetly doesnt help.
---
Yeah the moment where he said he found out who the third person was and it was starting to make sense was pretty much the nail in the coffin as far as I'm concerned.
---
I remember that day when I log in my nice lil' cosy wormhole. Stars are shining, ships are spinning and suddenly a new signature pop up on my scanners. I reach for my ol' trusty Cheetah and quickly scan it down to discover a Pirate data site ! As I complete it, a Stratios that wasn't from my corporation uncloak right on top of me, but fail to pin me down because of the recalibration timer as I warp to safety in my Azbel. None of my corpmates were on at this time, so here was the scene : 
---
**A dirty wormhole miner that generally prey on oblivious highsec explorers VS an endured PVP player !**
---
I actually managed to grab its capsuleer's name and check his zkillboard to see the Stratios he flew were all extremely expensive ! With lust in me eyes, I decided to set up a trap for our little friend. I knew he was still around, after all, he probably had plenty of time to check my killboard and think that I was an easy picking. So here I elaborate my plan : I warp to the insta undock bookmark in front of my Azbel, anchor a Mobile Depot, and wait with one of my alt manning the Azbel's defenses.
---
And I was right ! He was still here, waiting to catch this Cheetah ! He did quick work of my poor Covert Ops frigate and since I was a complete retard, I didn't knew how to switch between a citadel's guns and fighters... He only took a bunch of Upwell Heavy Missiles and left as my point died to cooldown.
---
But I wasn't done here ! Darn it, I said, as my still shaken pod docked in the citadel. I was still raging by missing such an expensive target... But wait, the mobile depot is still out ! As I grab my Wolf (fitted with le good scram), I warp back on it and cross my fingers for him to be there. He picked up the fight again ! But this time, I was even more prepared : he was under the fire of my small autocannons with the good ol' reliable : the T2 short range ammo and the scramble ! And I actually saw the button to launch fighters...
---
The advanced drones made short work of him, and as he warped out in his pod, I lustily looted his wreck to find my first kill worth more than one billion ISK ! I did everything with that wreck : loot and salvage, as everything was to be kept safe and sound in the best Azbel there is out there.
---
And a killmark for your eyes ! [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75467631/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75467631/)
---
Imagine electing someone clueless about the game to act like an expert and then being surprised that he leaks everything to his friends advising him. 
---
High chance he was just asking expert questions all the time to pando, with the questions pando figured out what ccp had in mind, told it to darkshines that bought for a trillion of whatever was going to get buffed. Being clueless as he is it might very well be that Brisc wasn’t even aware that someone could ever speculate on it which doesn’t change anything to him being a leaker. It’s obviously all hypothetical but this is imo a plausible scenario.

Noob here, with a noob question: I keep seeing people use the term, but what are FAXs?
---
Why bother fixing caps when you can just nerf them?
---
Why bother resolving capital projection issues when you can just make caps useless?
---
Why bother even posting anything that isn't a meme or I can get dozens of drones to upvote, because one wormholer or mega alliance guy will see it, mention something, and whatever it is will get downvoted to hell and/or have the post/thread hidden?
---
I find it amazing eve is killing itself from within.
---
No, but appearently you missed the part where the FC getting called out was an Incursion FC who tried to fight Muninns and Nagas with caps, and an entire bomber fleet had to SD and burn JCs to come save them.
---
Does this mean that North Koreans are just renters?
---
Considering the fucking (estimated) *size* of the damn thing, it's got to be a station of some sort. 
---
Assuming that the guy that did the comparisons of it next to a Keepstar was right, this thing is many times larger than a titan.
---
Capital Support ships; powerful remote shield/armor repairers - AKA: Clerics/Healers.
---
There was a hostile nag set on approach to a book mark on a raitaru. I had a bumping frigate and for several hours we kept breaking it's tether, waiting to see if the piolet was afk. He was for a bit and do to it being an odd hour for all timezones his response fleet was kitchen sink. Funny thing is we we're moving and we didn't have enough dps to do anything. Still, breaking his tether for hours was hilarious.
---
Same bumping frigate, in jita, I hit a Charon from the top on an edge and made it flip over. I broke the game XD. Charon was fine and left.
---
Found a bug fix ccp had used with the new moon set up and got 2 weeks free Omega.
---
First solo kill was my cruor against a confessor. I opted for only one gun and my single drone for dps. Capped confessor out then had to sit there for 20min shooting it. Awkward GF given in the first 3 min.

i tested this, and this bug only exists with the t2 siege module, ifd you use the exact same fit with a t1 siege, it'll work as it should
---

---
Works as intended
---
Then why the Christ are you here?
---
Was barely a month into my new corp when we took down a Chimera. I got the ping, joined the fleet, followed FC's orders, and using my free tackle frigate managed to do my "job" without getting killed. Still remember the thrill and excitement I felt watching it explode.
---
Up to that point I had done small nullsec corps, some FW, and a bit of ratting. Never had I joined a PvP fleet, and never had I helped hunters take down a capital ship.
---
Roughly six months later, I saved up enough to get my very own carrier. Slowly got the modules I needed for a decent ratting fit, and after a bit of training with a corpmate I was confident enough to undock and use it. Felt so proud.
---
Around the same time, I started getting more active in the incursion community. Went from a newbie ship, to a DPS ship, to a better DPS ship, and netted by first billion fairly quickly. Then my second billion. Then my third. Felt damned proud of that, too.
---
While I would have to think its a Trig Capital, it looks more like a citadel with all the traffic lights and what not on it
---
or cloak and burn out of the bubble so they don't follow you through, depends on how many/how close to decloaking you they are
---
Test stuff, you funny guy.
---
Google sheets
---
People keep saying that pando and shines weren’t core leadership, but they are part of Bliss’s inner circle. I can tell you for certain that they assisted in most all of the decision making for the alliance. I’m not saying “oh init ded. F #RIP”. I’m simply saying that their removal from the game will have an impact on the alliance. INIT has FCs who can step up, but losing two people who help make strategic decisions will undoubtedly have an impact.
---
My bet now is that recons will be the next nanosmallgangpvp target.

I accidently started a war in the North.

Its def just being swapped, prob during the patch yesterday

Don't you understand? It's on the priority list!

If they are consistent they will organize the problems in a list by their apperance. So it will be right after somewhere the stuck modul problem which is present for like 8 years now.

With some luck your grandchildren (assuming you are in your eraly 20s) will be able to use rapid torps again.

I'm looking to roll an alt to hunt Guristas ded sites; now I'm trying to decide between either a proteus or a tengu. I know the proteus can do a maze in about 5-10 minutes, but how is it for lower class sites?

A neut Legion will fuck a Tengu.

If you are asking how to kill them.
---
A dread with an XL disintegrator, smartbomb, and neut bonuses would be sexy enough.

Man someone on the test server should have told them that in advance, like two weeks ago...
---
Force Auxiliaries, which are logistic (healer) carriers.
---
We've been missing some good meme videos lately. What software do you use for all of this?
---
Some baddies tackled a rorq in our hole with a couple HICs, 5-6 rattles, T2 logi, and various recons. We had maybe 7-9 guys online and no doctrine heavy enough to really force them off. 
---
I pinged and we got in a fleet. The fleet decided to go with sleips and cheap snowflake ships but as we undocked, I didn’t really think we had a chance. The rorq was in armor at this point. 
---
Last second before we warped in to likely suicide, I called it off and made everyone dock. I told people to immediately reship into as many command dessies as we had, with anyone who couldn’t fly one getting in ECM instead. A few guys didn’t have either, so I told them to get in T1 logi and anti-tackle ships. 
---
We undocked a second time with the rorq getting into low armor. I gave frantic commands right before we warped, then we engaged. First boosh got 1 ship, second boosh got nothing, third boosh got 2-3 more ships. After that they still had 1-2 ships on top of the rorq and I thought we were fucked, but the rorq pilot started yelling that he was in warp. I couldn’t believe it and made him confirm like three times. Once I was sure he was getting out, I called to disengage and we got out without a single loss. I think the rorq even killed an interceptor while it was waiting for us. 
---
TL;DR rorq got tackled and I made the call to reship into a crazy and outnumbered rescue doctrine, and somehow it fucking worked.
---
Okay hear me out: What if it's a structure, and you can dock in it, and log out in Drifter space?
---
I got the pastebin from DBRB who leaked it in the INN twitch chat.
---
I mean recons themselves are never really a huge problem for small gang. It tends to he a pain when they are used in conjunction with stuff like fax
---
The only difference I’ve noticed is you have to micromanage drones a bit more. For example the deviant automata suppressors used to be a non issue to a gila drone, now they can take out your drones if you aren’t paying attention. All in all not enough to switch out of gila imo.
---
Doesn't even matter if it is. Just have this thing show up in any system with a low power structure and apply its massive-damage superlaser 24/7
---
That one time, when I undocked. It was crazy out there.
---
Poke
---
But we do. 
---
He broke a NDA. 
---
What he said doesn't matter, if he or others could get an advantage from it or not doesn't matter, if it was an misunderstanding it doesn't matter.

CCP banned three people, that means they have logs. 
---
Thats all the evidence we need in a case like this.
---
You're acting like we need more, " like this is a fucking trial"
---
À failed model estimation.
---
Honestly at the end of the day, people need to come back to reality that Eve Online is a game. People who let their friendships IRL end over pretty pixels in a computer screen made by some company that, quite honestly, won't last forever need to get their priorities in life sorted out.
---
But yeah OP's is right to end that friendship because, as someone mentioned, if he started trusting this guy for something far more important, he's done for.
---
Who had a higher station in life?
---
dreads were the only cap that weren’t fucked. This wasn’t intentional
---
Loki will too. Those are probably the only two good options. Bigger guns would work, but then you’ll lose the cloak. Smaller stuff probably won’t work bc tengu + sleeper aggro will eat you.
---
Is this also why every single time my VNI alt destroys a rat since the update, 'You cannot activate that module as the target is no longer present' pops up. Obviously it's purely cosmetic but I'm sure it only happened occasionally before.
---
Way to prove how stupid most of us Americans are.
---
god please let it be that. itd shake up the game so much
---
Ahh, i meant in case of a player owned ship, but yes that as well.
---
$10 a month? I don’t pay anything for mine after the initial cost. Maybe it changed recently?
---
I was scared there for a second... if they would have the resources to build one of these, what would they put into it's screens.
---
Thats what i suspected. Eiher that or just stay out of range of the suppressors. I already have to since the short range ones can kill light missile.
---
Your best bet is another T3, ideally with neuts as /u/pillarofpositivity mentioned.
---
A well-fit Tengu is going to have a very strong active tank, and breaking it with straight-up damage will not be easy. Therefore multiple energy neutralizers are recommended to shut off or hamper its shield reps.
---
Tengu can put out 800+ DPS, so whatever you're hitting it with needs a pretty strong tank of its own. Tengu gets range bonuses, so engaging at short range is probably ideal.
---
All of these point to "neut Legion" as a covops-fit Legion can sneak into scram range, grab the Tengu, and start ripping its cap apart while missiles + drones do the rest. You could try lasers, but they're probably a bit too cap intensive for this.
---
If the Tengu is poorly fit, you could possibly take it down with an active tank Stratios, just be advised that it's entirely possible you won't have enough neuting pressure or DPS to break it.
---
Yeah, I had several people tell me to delete or edit it in some way, and I didn't realize it was already a known issue ([https://forums.eveonline.com/t/april-2019-release-known-issues/151527/2](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/april-2019-release-known-issues/151527/2))

This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---

When we were part of -7-, we did a drunk BS roam with a haw moros as an escalation because one guy said his insurance ended the next day. We roamed from KBP in a 20-25 man bs fleet with 1(?) wondeful logibro to say we had one. 
---
Roamed to the end of jump range, found nothing. Was 2 hours in so we said "fuck it" we'll move the moros. 
---
We jumped the dread into WLAR I think, just as a proteus landed on the gate and jumped through. He came back and followed us while we gated a dread in catch screaming bait. 
---
Fast forward 3 jumps, we nabbed this guy afk on a gate https://zkillboard.com/kill/59996019/ after poking him for a solid 5 minutes because he was screaming bait
---
Go a bit further we noticed the one guy following us had turned into 5 and scout ran into a magus on the outgate. We landed, magus booshed half the bs off and c02 drops a bunch of blops bs at 20some! We lose a couple bs while the dread seigrs and tears through a proteus,  widow,  and sin forcing the c02 blops to mjd off. We all drunkenly cheered until a random Tri cerb fleet jumped through and finished everyone off https://zkillboard.com/kill/59996678/

The only narrative I've been calling out is the stuff Vily and PGL are admitting in this pastebin &amp; the comments in this thread - TEST has a savior complex and issues being hypocritical that holds them and limits content in the game.

If you plan on going to live in null train as many levels of Infomorph Psychology as you can stomach.

This is exactly what I am looking for, exploration and mining. I will definitely get in contact with those organizations once I feel comfortable with basic mechanics.
---
Thanks again.
---
It's like we had to come back to high sec to have fun fleet battles again!

Stand a chance doing what?
---
its maybe because you have XL hybrid ammo in your cargo hold
---
No no no. I never go afk in the abyss. I've been looking for alternates to the Gila for a while but nothing can match it's tank +dps combo. Since most of that came from drones, I wanted to know if the health change made the drones too easy to kill. If the Gila loses its drones it can't always survive the t5. 
---
Also. How would you afk in hawks? Lol. I've been running hawks lately.
---
I think we need to talk about the real issue here, it looks like you put a cloak on your Munnin.
---
Keep in mind that most of these entities are PvP orientated or will required your participation in PvP fleet on a regular bases. Might not be that often, but often enough so that you have to even if you don't like it. You can find NS alliances that only do PvE, but they pay a rent to PvP entities so that they can use the systems they are living in.
---
Remember the [good old days] (https://zkillboard.com/kill/57816058/) when Tengus could really tank?
---
I mean that would be cool, but I thought the whole purpose of the abyssal pockets was they were temporary and quick content.
---
I could see this thing being like a FOB on steroids shutting down like a constellation but with more menacing effects than incursions.

That Hel could have taken alot of those bombers out if he would have used the bombs on hes fighters, but most ppl do not even know about that option as its not needed for ratting :l

After TEST lost the Fountain war, I went to Delve to try and snipe some of the lesser money moons out from under whatever moon vultures we had at the time (like javajunky lol.) I started scouting and ninjasieging stuff with 2 dreads. However, turns out that not only were mercury and cadmium moons were available, but so were all the R64s. TEST had abandoned the region and were letting towers go unfueled. So, I said fuck it, and started ninjasieging the R64s as well.
---
Long story short, I ended up as the owner of all of Delve's R64s for about a month or two. At the time, Delve was one of the three best regions for R64s in the game. Turns out GSOL was so busy putting up infrastructure in Fountain that they had no manpower to spare for Delve. My insolence was tolerated not only because of that, but because I inadvertently ticker tanked the moons -- hostiles saw the &lt;CONDI&gt; tag and assumed the moons would have been defended by the full force of the then-CFC. In reality, no one but my two dreads and two triage carriers were gonna come to defend that shit. I made a shitload of money from that period of time, and ended up owning the cadmiums and mercuries in Delve for more than a year later.
---
I had HAIL loaded. Just tested it on the test server. Looks normal there.  
---
Also i have over 2900 DPS on singularity while its 2737 in Tranquility
---
Wow... I guess I did not get that impression with the multi-paragraph post you made citing many more points than almost all of your "space friends" are gone.  
---
It kinda looks like you list quite a few reasons why you feel the game is in a disheartening decline.... My bad.
---
First thought when i saw the orange in the original picures: Leads to dangerous unknown parts of space. :S
---
im not talking about what you had loaded. if there is hybrid ammo in you CARGO HOLD and you do not have the skills to use the ammo then the fitting window will tell you that you do not meet the requirements to use the fit
---
1. Find a problem

Few years back, when I was still mining in high sec there was some miners in my favorite belt. Favorite belt also means the only belt I bookmarked. Nevertheless, the Orca and the few miners who were there, would just swap to any rock I started to mine in a bid to make me go away.
---
Annoyed, I did leave but not until I checked out the corp that the miners were in. Discovered they were in a war with Marmite. So naturally, I hopped on another char, eve mailed Tora saying there was an Orca and some miners in the system I was in. About thirty minutes later I come back to find some Marmite guys still in system, with the wrecks of the Orca and the various miners in the belt. Also got 50 million ISK for "location services", so I think that makes up for any lost ore :)
---
So it's gonna be like those Sansha tower things that show in incursions? Triglavian Incursion hype! 40 ships enter, run out of time and all that bling goes kaput!
---
I listed what I and many others suspect are contributing to this small scale exodus, but personally it’s getting hell of a lot more lonely the older a player you are, at this point I’m gonna have to consider a retirement home lol
---
You are mistaken, kind Sir, you see bots aren't allowed in Eve.
---
Yes it is, if you jump in with the right people you'll learn a great deal and you'll find your own niche in the game. I've recently returned with a bunch of people I used to play with, quite happy so far.
---
I know what you mean, i only had projectile ammo. Simulated exact same fit on singularity and it worked as intended.
---
Eve is a sandbox. If you goal is to have fun, you can from day one get into a fleet, be useful and wreck a bunch of shit. Within the limit of how well the game is balance, new players have roles they can perfectly fit in, be it in the economy or in PvP. Can you credit card your way into a capital ship ? Yes. Are you gonna roflstomp new players if you do so ? No, more like the other way around. The bigger the ship you fly, the bigger the target on your back is. People are begging to destroy shit. Some veterans are flying mostly frigates on a daily basis even tho they can use titans.
---
Do like everyone else did. Fly small, fly cheap, learn your way into the game because there is a lot to learn about, and progressively get your way into bigger ships.
---
That would have been to much for dinobrain.
---
&gt; mothership
---
go back to 1971 with your complaining
---
have a downvote you misinformed sir.
---
also, look forward to the next bot pop.  where CCP forcefully cynos bots into highsec for us to kill.
---
Hmm... mine is sort of limited, I haven't gotten into anything interesting in my long Alpha career, but there was that one time when, in a poorly-set-up Imicus, I scanned down one of those Deadspace Relic/Data complexes, I forget what kind, in high-sec. This was out in Genesis (CONCORD's directly-controlled space), in a stretch between Tar and Tekaima, so Sec was probably somewhere between .7 and .5
---
I didn't have the resources or manpower to do the site, those are the ones that are loaded down with obstacles and traps, but I was able to get a more experienced player to run the first part of the site with me. The thing is, one of the hazards was a constant damage aura you'd eventually have to wade into to solve part of the puzzle, and his tank couldn't handle it. I ended up having to run back to hangar, grab my Navitas from the tutorial missions, and fly some light Logi.
---
The loot wasn't much since we couldn't do more than that first area, it couldn't have been more than a few Mil when we split it down the middle, but it was one of my first co-operative play experiences, and it taught me the value of flying Logi.
---
you're not wrong.
---
It's never a good time when a girlfriend fleeces your computer/smartphone.
---
That's why I have screenlock even at home.
---
I see a severe lacking in the mention of Poitot, the only named system in the Syndicate Region of space.
---
Spontaneously decided to start praising a Jita isk doubler for his generosity, saying he's actually doubling money. I was convincing enough that he collected almost a bil before the money stopped rolling in. He sent me a small tip and hit me up to try it again later, but was less successful.
---
No matter what type of vids you like. Splitting them up in 1-3 min vids is alwyas worse than putting all of them together into one...
---
Oh well in that case, no, it's not too late. Participating in fights can be done pretty much from day one, and strength in numbers helps mitigate individual weaknesses until you have trained your character (and game knowledge) up enough to be more solo-capable.
---
Only certain subsets of skills apply to the ship you fly at any one time, and those skills can only be trained to a certain level. This means that you can achieve skill-based equivalency with other players quickly with focused training, and the only thing holding you back at that point would be how quickly you pick up on game mechanics.
---
Exactly... Booshers want to have a cake and fucking eat it too....? Can't have both ways! There is no action that triggers reaction...

Why can't the Myrmidon field 5 heavy drones at once? I was looking through the ships and it really surprised me it can't.

I did my market research on what to produce moon mining, so I started churning out Silicon Diborite and selling it in Kits for a tidy profit.

After a month I noticed that I was ISK neutral, turns out I saturated the very small market .-. I learned to check volume traded from then on.

Why do you use hybrid ammo on your naglfar?
---
Are you some sort of stupid?
---
are you sure about that? I mean, it is a phoenix
---
I've always said CCP are 'very good' at maths. Screwing up promotions percentage, now this.
---
so what you are saying is that they shouldnt have taken the fight?
---
There was a harpy fleet, then some of the incursion runners got themself tackled, harpy fleet jump cloned to esoteria to save incursion fleet and then there were not enough ppl online to jump clone up north to perimeter.
---
Testing is for losers

FYI literally nothing that makes the game less afk will make bottling harder.

---
&gt;55 battleships is a lot to a 10k character alliance in 2019?
---
The other fights had a bit more impact ISK-wise, but also, needing to call a defensive strat-op for the keepstar timer also costs the alliance.
---
That's why you will never land a job in CCP's development team.  :( You test things.  
---
That a scrub.
---
That has to be soon, they're trying reaaaaal hard for sub numbers right now.
---
That would be amazing

thx

And even Mittani himself said that there are no botters in goons.
---
OH they teleported a couple of boting caps to HS to die!
---
Ramp up those stripminers. Mining mutaplasmids
---
im curious as i didnt even know they did this, when was the last time they did it?
---
1) Do ALL the tutorials because you will learn the basics and makes some money which you will need and get some free ships which you can either use or sell for more money.
---
2) See number 1
---
3) Get or make a good custom overview (that's the little box, normally) on the right that shows stuff in space) because the generic one is arse.
---
fun for me =D

fuck you're right, you just killed my one dream of working at ccp :(

damn you and your facts

I miss you stunt my unknowing senpai.

One time I solo'd an omen navy in a tristan, the omen was completely trash fit but it still took a lot of micromanaging cap, reps, and drones etc over the course of like 15 minutes to make sure I properly defanged his drones, didn't lose tackle to no cap, die by getting too close or far away, etc.
---
I also did the same to a brutix once, but some dickhead came in while the dude was in structure and whored on him ruining the solo killmail.
---
eh its not like they gonna do it every time. its a fun event like burn jita.   
---
outside of that,  they get banned as they found.   
---
but gotta sort through the false reports.
---
Ramp those moon mining

The incursion fleet?

Hell no. PGL was right. They should have got safe as soon as the Muninns showed up in Intel.

Maybe. But that's not really what we do.

I joined a little over a month ago and have enough trained skills to complete and a way to earn steady income. It's not too late. If you want you can pick up the free to play version and just train skills and pick it up down the road.

Have you SEEN Drifter battleship fleets. Drifter Battleships have doomsdays. They dropped an avatar like it was nothing then just moonwalked out
---
Drone proteus is great for Gurista space and yes can run the maze that fast. I will point out though you can do the maze that fast even in an Ishtar, you don’t necessarily need a t3.
---
People get intimidated by Eve's real-time training system, and worry that it means they will never be able to catch up to veteran players. In truth, I have found that the way Eve's progression is structured makes it significantly easier for a new player to be competitive with vets, as compared to an average MMO.
---
Then we both agree lmao. My comment was about TEST "taking" the fight like it was some noble content creating fleet when it was just stupidity
---
Seriously though. If you haven't already, send them your findings.

Super bots have been around for YEARS. This is not new, but nice troll attempt.

nope, i visited the website about 4 months ago, think its dead. I joined in diablo 2, was also in dawn of war for a while
---
its not to late.
---
i joined....6...8 years ago?   
---
and in the past 1.5 years, i've had 8 friends join.   2 of them are now richer than me.  and the remaining 6 are all trained into doctrines and having fun (and trapping me in Horde.  ah well its a fun place.  WH will have to wait).
---
once you spend like 3-4 months training, you'll be able to use most ships to fight even the most experienced.
---
and if you just want to get in and fight fast, 2 hours of learning to play and training skills, will let you roam in a frig and fight.
---
in EVE, its not about the money or skill,   its about your fit vs their fit (rock paper scissors), and who you know (bring friends. now its 2 rocks vs 1 paper.  paper gonna DIE).
---
I know you can have your spreadsheet pull from ESI. Not sure how, but ours tracks our Corp contract market automatically.
---
I wonder if its a station that we will find only inside Abyss pockets. Perhaps the timer will become a thing of the past and we'll have a choice of getting out or docking up to emerge into another Abyss pocket, or even same one.
---
So is it that the Triglavian didn't know about captial or super captial ships, then they saw Capsuleers flying them and decided they wanted some too?

CCP has always literally fascinated me as a company because I'm a business person myself, with degrees both from formal University and the University of Hard Knocks as well as IRL experience.
---
They consistently do things that mollify a smaller percentage of people bitching about some aspect of the game, usually by nerfing, thereby pissing off a larger percentage of people, some of whom get pissed off to the point of quitting because CCP fucked up their toys in which they have invested effort, time, ISK and even real world money (legitimately).
---
What makes it fascinating is that in any business this is if not suicide, it will do very bad things to your bottom line.
---
Flying around J-space in my first astero I had to log off quickly and forgot to bring my probes back in... when I logged back my exit WH had closed and I had no way to scan a way out.

I was top damage on the first [lowsec mothership](https://zkillboard.com/kill/210909/)(yes, they were mothership back then) kill using a HIC.  There was one other mom kill in lowsec previous that neuted him below jump cap and bumped to keep him out of warp.
---
I'm pretty sure I had the first Sin kill.
---
That's all I really have.
---
And people still somehow think CCP is going to actually get hard stuff right, like the 64 bit client, when they plan on not having a fallback.  They can't ever even get basic number changes right.   :MichaelJacksonPopcorn:

Yeah Google sheets can pull the esi just the same way all the apps and browser based SeAT can.

I think you are talking about the dawn of liberation event. That was a separate event about 2 weeks before GM week.

That’s pretty dope, wonder how difficult it is to do it yourself tho, any idea?
---
Really not too late at all.  Lots of people hate on skill injectors, but it does afford an opportunity to "catch up" at a price.
---
But really, they're not necessary.  A lot of good action to be had, especially in pvp, with minimal skills and isk.
---
its an alliance in game, recently had 3 of their leadership banned.   so the reddit community is still laughing about it.

you can disregard it.

The insurance changes are retroactive so you won't get shit back when it dies anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.

I'm just kinda proud of how sneaky I am with a cloaking device. Lost track of how many times I've loaded in a system with my covert ops ship only to be confronted a Flycatcher or Sabre, yet dodged the decloak by less than 20 meters (per overview). Especially tasty when it comes right after premature local-gloating. 
---
Another time flying my cloaky-Epithal, I poked my head into a system in Etherium Reach to see if it was empty, saw it was not, and hastily jumped back. An interceptor, however, followed me into the next system. I jumped to the nearest POCO and had the presence of mind to jump within 100km while he did not, but I was dumb enough to re-cloak (thus requiring 30 seconds before I could jump again). He turns and heads straight for the last spot I was occupying. So I point straight up and just mooooosey, mooooosey, moooosey reaaalll slow as he approaches, sweating the whole time wondering whether he'd come close enough for the decloak. Missed me by less than 2km. Swept the area for a while then gave up. I was carrying 100m in P4 products.

No, it's not. Join a newbie corp that specializes in teaching the game mechanics, they basically tailor all activities to players with little to no training and knowledge(alpha). You can get a lot of fun out of this game in beginner ships until you find out if you like it and want to go deeper!

Until you realize the target tengus are interdiction nullified and will just cloak after they warp off, making any attempt of counter play effectively useless as they afk in space until you go away.

That is actually the correct ingame model size.

I mean I understand it is interesting to talk about. But what good does it do to release a report? To know that thing specifically he leaked about? Who blew the whistle on him? 
---
I know it's fun for drama and such but I doubt the story behind it is very interesting in itself. What do we expect to be in there that's so interesting? I expect all the downvotes cause "haha, we dunk on gons and gsm" It's like catching a politician in insider trading, knowing the stock or whatever doesn't really wow me in that.

Iirc he said something like "it's starting to make more sense now", leaving it cryptic like that. Internally init is till only guessing and all three are stillin the dark if it comes to feedback from CCP.
---
I was thinking that he probably meant the FC situation of init amd that someone utilized CCP somehow?! 
---
I know, much tinfoil - many guessi...
---
Unless i missed something and you're not talking about TiS on the day it happened.
---
HAM loki?
---
It is true that at this point in the game, cap umbrellas literally need a PvE challenge with a guaranteed loss rate equivalent to that of level 5 Abyss, which according to last CCP statement on the matter (Eve Vegas) is just below 10%. This would truly provide an asset / ISK sink and balance out the game while at the same time hopefully make it better for active rather then inactive players such as bots / AFkers / mass multiboxers.
---
Why would any true gamer want a example of some bot?!

It's the player who decides to cheat, not the game, game developer or the bot coder.

I started *strategically feeding* dreads in the North *totally because I was scouting Slycd &amp; Darknesses responses*. I also started heavily scouting Deklein and realized there were a lot of targets. I delivered my initial report and coaxed Zungen and Kun’mi to join me which brought some sigs n squads.
---
After a little while the fights started scaling up, we expanded on our reach, gathered more information, and created a real problem. This started baiting out better responses from GOTG, which got Asher Elias interested.  More sigs n squads came in.
---
Long story short NC and BL started helping, the enemy got burned down over time, propaganda, gorilla warfare, strategic objective successes ultimately resulted in full deployment of Imperium assets to the north killing numerous keepstars, devastating a region, and crushing multiple alliances (F for Mordus Angels, Chaos Theory).
---
**TL;DR** - I wanted to attack Darkness and I bitched and moaned and annoyed everyone until they were all like “shut the fuck up Bill” and moved ships to help me.

Imagine being retarded enough to put hybrid ammo in a nag then post about it
---
I remember when the call went out to undock caps for the doomed A24 keepstar defense. I had personally made, fitted, fueled and kitted most of the caps my corp was using, and, as is my tradition, serialized them in the name(Revelations were GB Shipyards RV-001, 002, nids were GB Shipyards ND-001, 002, etc). Most of my corpmates had left the names as is. I undocked, Dscan refreshed, and my dscan window populated with caps I had made. In that moment, I was proud, not just for me, but also for how far Lethal had come since being some upstarts in fountain in the shadow of the culture.
---
And then the keepstar exploded, but not before a hell of a lot of ships died.
---
Or join and build your way up to replacing them, that's the beauty of EVE.

Well they do.

I totally missed it.. can somebody explain me what's the purpose of this thing?

Can confirm Elo is such a great harassing FC he made progod commit suicide (in-game).
---
Not disposable, but stupid strong, especially uncapped (they're promising a 'diminishing returns' system for reps); when you get a big ball of them all spider-repping, your chances of breaking an individual tank goes way down.
---
except the memo is actually being released, in a redacted way eventually.

---
&gt;I was thinking that he probably meant the FC situation of init amd that someone utilized CCP somehow?!
---
Or, following Occam's Razor, perhaps he just realised what it was that he'd done wrong?
---
I've been running T3 darks in a cheaper version of this fit, everything T2 except 2x Fed Navy Webs and Republic Fleet Large Cap Battery. 3% implants. 500m-ish total. Works pretty well, been too scared to try out T4s even though it's probably fine (finishing T3s with 5-8 minutes to spare usually)

Nope. I started playing a couple months back, I've been having a ton of fun in New Eden. There's a myriad of playstyles, miles and miles of game-depth, and a really helpful and supportive community (just look at the 'no stupid questions' threads on this subreddit).

You can play cheaply as an alpha account, or invest a bit of cash to go Omega, or put just a little extra cash into it and buy some in-game money.   
---
$20 USD gets you enough in-game cash to PvP for a long time if you stick to cheap ships. You can avoid needing to do any farming/grinding if you don't want to.

TBH these perimeter brawls have been pretty fun.  It's liberating to just blast away with T1 shit without worrying about escalations and bombs and boosh fleets and so on.  I'm not moving out of null anytime soon, but it's a nice change of pace.
---
Ahh,the UI customization mini-game. I love those. (not /s)
---
Thank you for suggesting this.
---
You completely missed the point.
---
Feeling cute, might delete later idk tho
---
Really the only counterpoint here is that CCP said the CSM brought this to them. Maybe Brisc let it slip to one of the non-Goon-affiliated CSM members, but that would be pretty dumb and just statistically unlikely based on the number of Goon candidates.
---
Earth is flat right?   
---
What would stopping INIT have to do with a attack on the north? There is one entity that can kill Panfam, thats Goons, INIT is nothing without Goons and have done nothing without them for years. 
---
The INIT deployment was a total fail and did absolutely nothing, after Test left Panfam literally wen't to krab mode, and that didn't change when INIT deployed.
---
TLDR; INIT means nothing to the north, goons do. Goons can kill all coalitions in Eve with or without INIT

The case against Brisc is prima facie an example of a corporate entity acting ultra vires, and while he may not generally be an amicus curiae -- given he is a lobbyist -- he possessed the necessary animus contrahendi to understand the consequences of contravening the NDA. We can therefore assume he lacked the requisite animus nocendi, and it stands to reason there may even be grounds for an argument of contra proferentem against CCP. In any event, without full disclosure this is a situation of sine qua non where the mere suggestio falsi is insufficient to damn Brisc uno flatu. CCP may have been fideicommissum to Brisc in his role as member of the CSM, but given his in-game persona's ties to his professional career and the manner in which CCP's decision was announced there is a strong possibility for laesio enormis and it will be difficult for the parties to achieve restitutio in integrum. Ergo, the ban should be voided ab initio. Fiat.

For me 2010-2014 was the golden age of EVE (in low sec) and I'm glad I got to take part.
---
The finger never returned
---
Since when was bringing dreads a high barrier to entry?
---
&gt; If you think brisc is innocent...
---
Let me start answering that, because i think it is important for reading the tone of the rest of my crazy rant.
---
I don't know if Brisc is innocent, all i have to go by are the CCP dev blog and Brisc statements/TIS interview. My guts felling is that he made a casual remake about something without thinking about it, but i build that on nothing more then that i want both Brisc and CCP to be right.
---
But i have been in the same corp as some one on the CSM and as i remember it as he said a little to much a couple of times when we was drunk on TS (but nothing happened). That combined with that it was somebody else from the CSM there brought it to CCP attention and the way CPP wrote the dev blog; really talks to my inder conspiracy nut and i *feel* like there are something more under the surface.
---
But again: What do I know? The only thing there are really important for me are; if i still trust CCP enough to give them (for me) a lot of money each month. I still do, but a little little bit less.
---
&gt; No developer will ever explain to third partys reason for baning someone.
---
And that is fine as long as that is legal in what ever legal system there have duistition over the contract/EULA between the player and the game company. But IANAL and as i understand it it's murky and untested territory. But i fully accept that at least in practice that is a game company's right (if it is in the EULA as it always is)
---
My problems with this case is CCP claiming that Brisc broke the NDA he signed, and in my mind (as a none lawyer) that is a more more serious thing then braking the EULA. But all CCP needed to do to convince me was saying that they have chat logs, i trust CCP enough that i don't have to see them to be convinced.
---
And if its true that CCP never talk to to Brisc about it, I *feel* (again as a none lawyer) they handelt it wrong. I mean i have to sign NDAs sometimes in my line of work and if this happened to me i would definitely see it as an attack on me and talk to my company's lawyers about what the options are.
---
But then again i see this as entertainment drama, a little like how i follow US politic for fun even trough i am not for the US.
---
Tl;Dr crazy rant and lots of spelling mistakes (even after 3 read through)
---
I more enjoy PvE, but maybe PvP here can peak my interest if I find it a good dose of entertaining and challenging.
---
Also, I have to ask. Micro-transactions........... how worried should I be? Don't get me wrong, I find it acceptable to spend money in f2p games if i get my money's worth, most often in quality time spent in the game. Hell, I already spent over 60e in Warframe alone, mainly because the shop is fair and not game breaking.
---
What is the situation with EVE regarding the cash shop and does it break the core game, i.e. will I have a much harder time as a f2p player or a low spender??
---
Just started the game last night. Was reading through this stuff to get a feel for the game and one thing I'm not clear on: aside from putting stuff I the skill training queue, is there something my character should be doing when logged off? I get the sense that people set their accounts to do tasks, but I'm not sure I understand.

&gt; WH's: I am not a wormholer and know that fax has some important role in your WH's. If ccp and wormholers really want to keep fax the same just for wormholes add a wh affect bonus that counteracts the change for womrholes.
---
wormholers are crying for fax nerfes since they got ''released''.  if you have trouble breaking a fax in null with your 100+men fleet, think about how shit it is to kill them with the ''average'' 25men fleets and the mass limits in wormholes...
---

I'd just like to appreciate the level of effort in getting the tab titles and the url right. That's solid attention to detail there.
---
&gt;Hello. I look forward to playing this game and interacting with its vast community.  
---
&gt;Any advice you have for me? What are some of the things you wish others told you when you joined EVE?  
---
&gt;Also, what faction would you recommend? I was thinking of joining the Gallente Federation since I find them to be new player friendly (I hope).
---
As already said, do all the tutorials, followed by all career agents available to you from the agency, in fact, you can repeat career agent missions since there are multiple career agents and each one can give you his / hers missions once. These are good to get a handle on the very basics as well as some starting ISK etc.
---
As far as faction goes, choose whatever you want but, I recommend eitehr starting as Caldari or at least also make a simultaneous second Caldari character because of Jita 4-4, just make a second account its free, which will make your shopping / selling stuff in the game quite a bit easier.
---
Don't spread your skillpoints. Stay concentrated. If you want to try different ship / weapon types for different activities make different characters instead. Reason is Alpha are limited to 5 mil Skillpoints total, 20 if you use injectors. If you spread yourself too much then you will not have enough skillpoints to become effective.
---
If you go omega then its less of an issue, but it still takes quite a long time to train stuff, so the issue of which you want to be 1st is still valid.
---
Look up "magic 14" skills, and realize that these alone take around 6 months at omega training or lots of $$$.  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)  here is the list.

---
Don't see Eve as a F2P game, see Eve as having a free permanent trial that allow quite a lot. First off, you won't be able to access some ships, including the real mining ships for mining for example. For exploration, you can't cloak, which can leave your somewhat unprotected when you're scanning. Combat ships are a lot more allowing for alpha players since you can fly every T1, faction and pirate ship that isn't a capital ship and almost every module.
---
One important point is that you will train half as fast as omega players, meaning training skills that will unlock new ships or modules and generally impact your feeling of progress and options will be quite slow.
---
If you can afford I would really advise you subscribe. I got hooked on the game playing as an alpha and subscribe, I can tell you the real pain will come from skill training speed.

&gt;Since jump fatigue became a thing.
---
Found stainguy's reddit alt.
---
Jump fatigue isn't a thing anymore.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem dunno if this helps and how much clay you find in Hisec ...
---
This is the correct answer
---
I was hoping for one that can do something besides dark. My hawk setup works pretty well for those. Only losing about 1 or 2 a day on average. My Gila can do all others except maybe firestorm because of the armor buff it provides. Even with close to 1k dps, it's close. 
---
I've checked out the Cerberus and it looks promising if you have level 5 hac+ close to perfect missile skills. The only problem would be missile application because hams are terrible. To fit a web you have to have an em hole or you aren't cap stable with the reppers running. Not even close. I was gonna hop on sisi and give it a go. 
---
Sacrilege was another contender but same problem as cerb. It also does slightly less dps than the cerb so run times are gonna be slower. 
---
Any turret based platform has the problem of tracking. The deimos looks great on paper but shit in reality because lol blasters. 
---
Any other hac also has the problem of breaking that dps barrier + tank. You either have great dps and not that great of tank for all sites or you have the tank but not the dps. 
---
Maybe this thread should move to r/fittings
---
Your assuming that during that 1 year absence they will not be involved though. They did not get the permanent ban just a year and can easily be involved outside of game for now. They just need an FC or two to step up for a bit.
---
Although I do think FAXes shouldn't really be able to rep subcap that well, if you can field 100+ cruisers you should have a dozen of dreads to kill them too.
---
1. Dread Caches are a thing
---
2. Jump Fatigue is barely a thing now

---
&gt; look forward to the next bot pop. where CCP
---
lmao imagine thinking ccp are doing their job well because of a pr stunt they did half a year ago
---
I would imagine about as much more as a subcap trig does over a normal battleship
---
FAX are an interesting ship. They are kind of the swiss army knife of stationary logi. They need to be flexible enough to rep a subcap fleet fighting carriers/subs, powerful enough to rep supers fighting dreads/supers, have enough local rep strength to deal with smaller fights, and enough buffer/resists to have a reasonable time to kill against dreads/supers. 
---
The issue I have with FAX is that they have opposite incentives/design theories for subcaps/solo or duo triage and caps/blob warfare. In a solo triage situation, you need to cram cap boosters &amp; batteries &amp; local reps on, manage your cap, and keep your targets alive. Lots of target switching, and if you're duo FAX coasting out of triage and capping up. There's a lot of nuance here that I'm not talking about but the point is that it's a very active role, balanced around mitigating incoming DPS, not capping out, and reacting to broadcasts quickly to compensate for cycle time/rep amount/lock time.
---
In blob warfare, none of that shit matters. The only things that matter are hitting your CEHE on time and repping the primary on time while you multibox your super/titan/subcap/dread. You are there in a numbers capacity - each FAX neutralizes a certain number of dreads and takes a certain amount of time to kill as a function of DPS on field. It's a much more passive role, and your tank is entirely buffer. 
---
Having a ship try to be balanced for subcap vs. subcap, subcap vs. cap, cap vs. cap, super vs. cap, super vs. super, etc. is a mistake. Having local reps strong enough to be able to rep through cap vs. cap fights means that you necessarily cannot realistically break a FAX with most subcap fleets. Having rep strength to keep supers alive vs. dreads means that you can easily mitigate dozens of subcaps with a single 1b hull. I don't know what the solution is, but right now FAXes are still incredibly oppressive.
---
(It's not that black.)
---
and an insignificant PR stunt to the bots =D
---
I think they should allow combat refitting in Triage only and disallow fax from fitting Capital Cap Boosters. Neuting was a more effective tactic against single or double triage when combat refitting was a thing
---

Of course. The moment you ship is cloaked, other clients won´t even get data about your position to avoid data-sniffing. So for other clients you really don´t exist as long as you´re cloaked

Every time someone asks this I want to reach through the screen and slap whoever asks this. It's only too late when CCP says they are turning off the servers.

Similar to how we're sure they QC/QA test updates before sending them live.

No possible, as for other clients you don´t exist when you are cloaked. This way you can´t run a data sniffer to know if someone is coming in cloaked

Horde whaling fleet in Malpais back when I was still pretty beanish.

---
We only got 1 and I fed my ceptor to drones so I didn't even get on the mail, but that was my first cap kill I remember being involved in, and it was all because I scouted it.
---
Might want to re-read the question and your first 3 words. Totally agree with you though.
---
Automata supressors are no big deal, just rotate your drones more often. Tessera rats on the other hand are a PITA. They can two shot even an augemnted drone, or almost two shot it. What I did is I switched out the small NOS that I had in the free upper slot for a small remote armor rep and I rep my drones while waiting at gate for cap regen before jumping into next pocket. This helps quite a bit.
---
As far as ship alternatives go, Vedmak is pretty good at Fire, hopefully the incoming Vedmak HAC will be even better. It can also do electricals. Phantasm and Zealot are ok for electrical as well, but I don't like them for any other filament type.
---
HAM Sac is ok for dark and fire as well. Some people play Cerberus but I don't like it, not enough fitting freedom for my taste.

‘Member when RNK did basically the same thing with triage and bling and everyone was like awesome good job and here we are now bitching about the same thing thanks for reading and godbless
---
So given that a nice DPS Rattlesnake does around 1600-1700 cold without boosters / implants, and Leshak does around 2400 without boosters / implants, that would be around 30%-35% extra over regular dread ?
---
Yeah. This shit is too meta for me. I don't understand why you didn't think he was capable of doing that in the first place.

The answer is Super-Fax

I joined last year. It is NOT too late to join, even as an alpha. If you get into mining and ratting, you will have a steady source of income, and eventually you will have enough to get better ships and equipment.
---
T3Cs are incredibly flexible and powerful in many roles, the tengu is particular packs a powerful punch and strong active tank that can be very hard for single ships to deal with
---
For optimal results, adopting an n+1, where n is the number of tengus you are looking to kill, doctrine is ideal when ganking T3Cs. A neuting Loki or legion with a HAM or autocannon Loki can easily take down a tengu. If the tengu is fit poorly, a stratios can be used as the neut boat, if the tengu is really well fit/neut player skills are bad a bahl is recommended to put maximum pressure on the tengu.
---
Nop, nothing more to do.
---
If its a dread, they could simply give it some unique siege bonusses that vary from otehr dreads in the game which would be more suited to the task.

It makes a difference if the BCs or BSs target a drone. Before you could just ignore that and keep killing but now you might need to recall and send them back out again.

So I'm exiting occasionally now with armour damage to a drone or two but I haven't had one destroyed yet.

Active fax does not need a nerf. Active fax is a thing because a single fax needs to be able to survive on grid while waiting for help to arrive. You have to be smart to beat them. Just because you can bring a 100 man fleet and not kill it does not mean it cant be killed. It just means you didn't bring a fleet comp to deal with a fax. Next time consider fitting nests in your blob and things might go differently.

The game itself in terms of playing got worse. Even more caps, more bots, more multiboxers. According to CCP Hellmar in an AMA done around 2 weeks ago game has around 1.6 accounts per actively playing player. That translates to over 1 out of 3 players in the game being either AFK, cheese boxed or botting per your usual 30k peak login on TQ. So its not a good sign.
---
However, CCP is making some changes that will hopefully improve the game for many people. I personally think that the incoming changes are a drop in the bucket of what is actually needed and more of a PR stunt just to say "o look we're doing something", but the final verdict is still pretty far out as we will have to actually see the effects of the changes over a few months.

There is some new decent PvE in form of AByss, and more coming, so at least on this front things are getting better. There is also a growing line of Triglavian ships, we'll be getting new Trig HACs and AFs relatively soon to add to the current Trig ships line. Possibly even a dread or station or something big. And Trig ships in general are the most fun ships to fly in the game, especially for small scale PvP and PvE alike. So there is that.
---
Saw this on the gaming sites today and made me remember the old game again. 
---
As the original CSM1 Queen of Space I heartily approve of Eve Online doing a better job of holding corrupt-ass republican lobbyist twats to account than the actual US government. 
---
Funny stuff, Eve never change :)
---
My guess is he offhandedly said something that he didn't think could be monetized / was generic enough he didn't think it was under NDA but actually was both.
---
He's not a politician is he.  He's a lobbyist.  There's a difference.
---
LMAO! My sides!
---
Its a difference if you nailed it or got nailed to it ...
---
It s 2 of the 3 strategic fc , our best fc and our supercap fc, so yeah it s a headshut. Hopefully Bliss is ok but Bliss doesnt play so much this time. We probably never know what happen exactly. Ccp has not answered them yet.
---
&gt;Active fax is a thing because a single fax needs to be able to survive on grid while waiting for help to arrive.
---
I’m pretty sure FAX are the help. What else are they waiting for? Super-FAX?
---
The question was, "I want to know what the CSM reported".  That is to say, the CSM reported that X had done Y with inside knowledge about Z.  Z is under NDA, so obviously whatever the CSM reported cannot be reported here.  It'll be 5 years before we know what Z was, if ever.
---
Or maybe someone with a big flapping gob will tell us.  I don't know.
---
Every one having access to a broken mechanic doesn't make the mechanic well balanced.
---
Svipuls when they were released were broken as fuck, the fact that anyone could fly them had no bearing on the fact that, before they were nerfed, they massively distorted the game in such a way as to make it worse. 
---
Super cap umbrellas do the same thing, they are a fundamentally broken mechanic that distorts the balance of the game, just by existing, in a negative way.
---
Does jintaan still play Eve?
---
Logi titans with reverse doomsday that adds hp every volley
---
god knows
---
Yes, but so far all we have is an accusation. People can assume the worst, but without proof what exactly can he be found guilty of? And how exactly is he to defend himself without knowing the details of what he's been accused of? (Assuming he really doesn't know.)
---
Rightfully said o7
---
The corax buff has been announced in public, like many many stuff of the last patch.
---
Its not in real time, although there has been progress happening at certain intervals. (I think there where 2 prior build states, but this is the most major change so far)  
---
and yes players can find it and fly around it etc, but its not something you can just do casually, there is a random chance of finding the room in tier 5 abyssals, and the npc's in there are of the "seriously not fucking around" variety, even by abyssal standards. so reliably clearing the room in order to get a good look takes an equally not fucking around fit, and some knowledge of how to fight them.
---
I'm just glad someone noticed :3
---
It will just go back up again. I suspect next plex spike will be when the Trig events go live to TQ as a lot of players will be activating their PvE characters for it.
---
He ran to be one, him not being one is down to the voters in real life being smarter then those in eve.
---
Is it copypasta? It feels like copypasta.
---
You were the one that stated Goons could kill all Coalitions, not me.
---
Interesting article but not /r/eve content I'm afraid!
---
You can definitely be great at this game as a new player. I have a high skill main, but my alts that specialized in something do better. Knowledge of the game is better than skills or isk.
---
It's fine, guys, Brisc will pay the 40 forts to be safe.
---
Ant that statement still stands.
---
That doesn't mean yiu can beat all at once
---
the day they say they turning off the server, is the day Iceland news reports of 3 psycho trucks that robbed a building of all its servers, led police on a chase, jumped on a ship, and sailed to parts unknown.
---
meanwhile EVE players will be surprised the server is back up the next day.
---
Check volume spiking on various faction guns on the 30th. 2 days before the announcement. Volume was bought up by one buyer for 2 months in steady increase, and then on the two days before (after he bragged about throwing thousands into plex), there was a huge spike in volume. 
---
The evidence is out there. Volume spiked to 3 to 5 times normal movement of the guns, which cleared out the market on most guns and launchers before the faction changes were announced publicly. 
---
This is information that would have been agreed upon privately at the CSM, and why recording devices were banned moving forward. All of a sudden, one buyer starts buying them up in incremental amounts for almost 2 months, and then in the days before hand, when the CSM would be put in the know, volume spikes in a big way. Hardly a coincidence.
---
Cheap 50nmil fit. I can run t4 all day no problems but in t5, I will die to the spawns that has anchoring + web + neuts. I'm running cheap implants and using db5 damage drugs. 
---
I'm not wanting to bling them because I have a tendency to mess up when multiboxing. A 50 mill frigate that lives 90% of the time hurts a lot less to lose than a 150 + mill hawk that survives 98% of the time. 
---
A good portion of my deaths have also occurred because boundary violations. I'm not the best pilot lol. 
---
 https://zkillboard.com/kill/75749806/
---
everyone saying you can join now, jump right in the deep end and have fun, is correct.
---
i'll give you a concrete example.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=144&amp;b=8558071&amp;e=90&amp;t=u
---
that is a battle report for a fight that happened today between two major groups of players. both with over 10,000 members. 
---
on the left hand side, if you scroll right to the bottom of the list, you'll find a player named Maverick Hashur flying a newbie friendly Vigil. in every fleet Pandemic Horde runs there will be a few new players, in cheap but effective ships like his vigil.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2115067575/
---
if you look at Maverick's killboard he first lost a ship on March 24th. shortly after starting the game. 6 days later he joined Pandemic Horde, moved down to our territory (BWF-ZZ losses) and started trying to make a living. 
---
Today was his first fleet fight and he helped kill 37 of the 56 enemies that died today.
---
Cause RnK were some of the first to do it. Pretty much everything RnK did was great until it was used in every fucking fight.
---
RnK used it to fight bigger groups and fight against the odds, but now literally everyone is using those tactics which sucks.
---
Ohh... I see your point! :(
---
Good to know. I also switch to fed navy drones instead of augmented on those spawns just in case. I even have tech ii in the hold.
---
It was a single coalition last time lol.
---
Pretty sure this post needs a /s bud.
---
I was in Brave when we were evacing from Cloud Ring in spring 2017, already moved my suitcase carrier and I was just staying in lowsec providing cynos for friends when a entosis fleet was done to grab GE-  in Catch that Test was so kind to provide. I was in comms but I didn't join the fleet because they started from 9-4 and I was already way ahead in lowsec towards Catch. The entosys fleet got into a few gatecamps that were organized like always when brave was leaving a region, got stuck while some previously scanned wh connections collapsed and after a hour or so I decided to start burning myself to the destination. I changed ships can't remember what I was flying at that time but I remember I went to Amarr to grab a toasting module and some fuel and started burning to GE. Two or three jumps away I intersected with Chester Paterson, former Beyond Frontier member that later was revealed to be PL spai. By the time the remains of the entosys fleet reached GE- me and Chester were already RFed the station that is now a Marginis class fortizar called SOTA FACTORY. 
---
Not much but I was there.
---
Jesus you are retarded.

If you wanted the actual picture it's [here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/black-hole-image-makes-history/).

we don't need nullsec to unite against anything!!
---
Thank you for your answer, it was very help full!
---
I got Evemon, which help a lot to see how far im from my goal.   
---
It is quit interesting. I added my fit from above which should could take T1 abyss. This cost 3,12m skill point and would take 55 days.   
---
I then found this Gila fit which can handle T3 abyss. That cost 1,66m skill point and take 51 days.   
---

---
The fun part is, that Im Gallente and not a Caldarien, so I think it will just be more easy to make a new clone, and have that as a goal fit. 
---
Cool with the Magic 14, I already had those, but that is more luck than actually going for it.
---
GODDAMNIT STAINGUY
---
Landed final blow on a Titan.  Pretty sure the pilot won eve after.  Feelsgoodman.
---
I am already waiting for free SP, somewhat around the fall of 2021
---
I doubt CCP went through with a ban based off word of mouth.
---
I could effort Plex with real money. My problem is my game time pr week. I do not have the time :(  
---
So it does not make sense. Sadly.
---
My theory for the purpose of this thing is that it’s a structure for some kind of trig site, event, or incursion. Similar to the Sansha Battletower in the HQ incursion sites.
---
Maybe they just used CCP round.
---
No, this is the correct size. I explained it in the post I made about that - the original image I had was a mis-scale, where I had it around the size of a dreadnought - this is the proper scale, where it's actually FAR larger
---
the good thing about leadership bans, is it opens up slots for new players who want to be alliance leaders. Alliance leadership is limited to "slots" in the game.  
---
3 slots have opened. So yeah nows your best shot!
---
Thank you for this fit. It is around 10M SP, so a little exepensiv, but will keep it in mind.   
---
I would definitely play my other clone  while a new is training up.
---
Swap to a full training pod.
---
this thread was about rorqs so i only comment on that...if someone rorq mined but wasnt in umbrella space already pre-patch...this someone was a idiot already. for the littly guy nothing changed with the patch
---
If you do anything differently than this guy, you're doing good.
---
It's got boosters on its back side, however ;P 
---
https://i.imgur.com/0BXVYOI.jpg
---
This is absolutely a mobile vessel, though I wouldn't be surprised if it falls somewhere between a ship and a structure in functionality.
---
no. to have standing for slander, it has to be **provably false**. he has to prove that its not true, CCP doesn't have to prove that it is true
---
I can neither confirm or deny the existence of my server extraction fleet. Rest assured those servers most certainly wont be relocated to a large datacenter in Arizona.
---
&gt; The corax buff has been announced in public
---
but was there market transactions before the announcement? i don't know for sure but I think someone else suggest there may have been in one of the other megathreads.
---
... (lives in arizona)  if you need a boat to run decoy. tell me =D
---
we expect great and glorious things from Young Maverick.
---
Yeh thats fair, we run them with 3 pilots and i think they are around 300 mill but i can see multiboxing might be a bit dodge.
---
Active since 2014 then ? Holy shit, I started in 2015 and had a better fit pve battle cruiser before 2016 rolled out...
---
Only if they are complaining to make PVE activities harder. For everything else, there's downvotes and plex.
---
Hem. You know that goon's megathrons got lanced, not TEST nightmares right ? 
---
I was on the supercap fleet, and watched the whole thing on twitch.

TEST's NMs got bombed.

The public part is what makes this amateur hour, all 3 previous instances of NDA breaches and removal of CSM were done with “XX has been removed for breach of NDA, the exact circumstances will be kept between us and XX”
---
Dopamine broke with that, likely because he doesn’t know what he was supposed to post. New in this role with Guard gone a few weeks ago. CSM members were Monday saying they’d post their version shortly, on Tuesday they said “no comment”, and CCP likewise, as finally a lawyer / someone who’s actually a professional had taken control of the situation.

Combined, their downvoting power is strong. Especially when they ping their members on discord to mass downvote.

Individually though, they are weak, risk adverse and scared to back up their claims in game. Normally relying on surprise tactics and spies, sometime at the same time. 
---
Course this will be downvoted, but your post was upvoted by pro brisc people. This subreddit is just a toxic hivemind. Post memes or dank intel leaks, otherwise post stuff CCP is doing/has done/should do.
---
It is never late. The game is more interesting to new players anyway.

Not really no unless you no life farm.

It seemed like a good idea at the time

Oh, interesting! Well he really could be a public figure then!

'Snuff, a group that gives no fucks about coalitions and blues' really made me laugh. Ok, I just smiled, did not laugh.
---
I won't lie, like this spin you are trying to round, round.
---
He, ofc can he telling the truth, so let's see.
---
For me there can only be one reason, some kind of change or nerf to Faction Titans / Supers NOT concerning HAW Guns. As the incident included a Molok sold by Dark to a Snuff guy that got confiscated. If CCP explains this with the HAW changes, people should start laughing at them and making jokes on how far a developer can be from the meta of his game ... As Dark bought other armor titans for the money that will be affected in the same way by the HAW change as a Molok.

It would be a nice bit of background story if it ends up being an incomplete vessel that never gained thrust capability, and that's why it's a structure.
---
I guess we can only speculate haha, but it definitely is intriguing.
---
Booster give the same amount of SP regardless of how much SP your character already have. Injectors do not. That's a real big reason for their use.

¿Porque no los dos?
---
Yeah. The problem for me is that not a lot of my corp mates want to run the abyss with me and the ones that do are outside of my time zone. Multi boxing them was the solution for me. 
---
That fit also works quite well
---
 It's survived spawns that probably should have killed it. It's also died to spawns that should have not been able to kill it but I think that's just me.

---
Are you sure? Because I am just reading the idiotic things you are saying and responding appropriately. Maybe in the future you could have a clue before you post? But probably not.
---
What part of FW can't be considered legacy?  The warp core stab check was implemented on to the gates.  They tweaked npc's inside the plex multiple times.  They denied rookie ships from being eligible to run the ticker.  They disallowed cloak activation from 30km from the beacon.  How hard is it to reduce the time for each plex or separate the offensive and defensive ticks on to their own meter?  
---
As for the lockouts.  I was around when they first came about before citadels broke lockouts and it made a world of difference in winning a system and pushing an enemy back.   Citadel use might be lower within the warzone by militia parties who think they can't defend their systems, but they can still be anchored in border non-fw lowsec systems along the warzone.  It's not as apocalyptic as you might think.
---
Or go do random shit in low and convo whoever inevitably comes to shoot you, with a bit of luck his corp is recruiting.

I know it's my coalition, but... I think I might hate PGL.

---
&gt; I’ve recently seen articles in the news about this game and it interested me a lot. Is it possible to join this game and stand a chance against older players without spending a lot of money? 
---
Yes and no. 
---
Eve is very different from otehr games, it is a long term progression, really long term, maybe 2-3 years before your main character will become fully effective at flying all sorts of ships on level that you will enjoy. To give you an idea, the very basic "magic 14 skills"  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)  take around 6 months to train if you are Omega. And this does not include any specific ship or weapon or utility skills.
---
To cut down that time it takes $$$$. Lots of $$$$. You can buy roughly 1.5 million skill points for $20 (very roughly and it often swings up or down), meanwhile your character will not become effective until it has around 30-40 million SP unless it is extremely specialized and you know what you are doing. Also, pass 20 million SP this cost increases due to diminishing returns on skill injectors. To give you an idea on the scale of diminishing returns, pass 80 million skillpoints on your character a large injector gives you only 150000 skill points instead of starting 500000.
---
More realistically, to have a wide variety of options on your main and be comfortable and do lots of things on it you will need around 60-80 mil skillpoints. With diminishign returns the costs of injecting can double or even triple.
---
With regards to being a "specialized" character. All this means is that you concentrate your skillpoints and thus fuck yourself by greatly limiting what you can do on your character. Alternative here is to have multiple accounts which inturn increases your costs times number of those accounts. Grinding ISK in the game for plex to pay for those extra monthly subs is a horrible in game existance and often leads to burn out and people quitting and if you choose this route you will find yourself in this position.
---
There are other factors as well to consider like why is it that you want to play Eve ? Were you drawn here due to some marketing with a video of huge battles in Titans or capital ships etc ? If so then be aware, that there are right down requirements for 2-3 accounts to fly these. These requirements are eitehr hard set by the given corp / alliance, or soft set by sheer necessity and practical use.
---
Some people turn to stuff like multibox AFK Rorq mining, or botting, to support their playstyles due to sheer costs and boredom of the grinding activities, neither one of which will be good for you, or the game.
---
Eve is real
---
Even mega coalitions have days when we get low turnout. Last night was one of those nights, it happens.
---
Not to mention that 250 of us were in a wormhole getting ready to drop another rorq when shit went down.
---
I definitely cannot put you on my extraction fleet volunteer list that does not contain 5 people.
---
Well, dark shines already said on reddit that he isn't coming back after his year if CCP don't lift the ban.
---
"that I couldn't kill and it made me sad" *
---
Wrong u can't neut out a proper wh fax
---
It could also be the fax nerf: a molok is a really tasty target for a dreadbomb if there is a way to mathmatically ensure it's death.
---
I already hear the guys who bought the big-bucks-monocle back then screaming... "Muh investmeeeent!" :D
---
Welcome to fortrestt abyssal deadspace, with a boson Triglavian titan on every gate.
---
pssst. the servers are in London
---
Well, sure they can. I did see that shines said something like “if the ban stays, I’ll be done”. 
---
Imagine the frustration of going from “make a plan, act on it” to “make a plan, expect others to act on it”. I’m not saying that they won’t still be involved, but that would be a difficult task to stay up on when you can’t actually play the game.

I got this guy in his [30Bil Kronos](https://zkillboard.com/kill/27758218/), and got invited to *a lot* of corps because of it. Abused a war dec mechanic to get the kill.

IDK [my killboard](https://zkillboard.com/character/2066728089/) is just generally full of shenanigans kills.

why would we need even more powerful ships? Rorq corps would builds dozens of them and make titans pointless
---
Fucking awesome! those sort of random kills are fucking dope.
---
I remember I had a 3-4 man gang of retards just roaming nullsec one day, and we happened to snag and group up with this streamer called Gent.  
---
I have a bad habit of just being friendly to randoms, and just convo'd him to fly with us when I noticed him streaming.
---
Not only did we catch a completely afk carrier and killed it (we were in like small trash, I think I was in a stabber), but my friend was in a boosher and some dipshit undocked a maurader, I think a kronos.
---
I remember giggling and telling him to "try to boosh him off station" and gent just going "guys. were in frigates.." to which I said "dude we just killed a carrier, and this guy going be braindead and shitfit, stick and move and dance"
---
We booshed him off, killed him in about 45 seconds, and it was the worst fit maurader i've ever seen (my killboard is huge, I won't be able to find it).
---
The look on Gents face, i'll never forget.
---
What makes you think it was a non-Goon affiliated CSM member?
---
That's not a well justified assumption at this point.
---
I totally have seen a lowsec system where 4 semi-afk corps where using refinerys, with slots free, you are not looking.
---
Lol, init salt about this is legendary
---
You can self rep and remote rep your subcap fleet with 0 cap as you inject cap and rep on the same tick. Easy and standard practice. Wh fax pilot btw
---
I've been winning eve for a while now.   My best was back in ~2013, I spotted a spy cyno and clicked warp about 2 seconds before 50ish BL piled into local.  I got to talk shit while they all landed on grid and my rorqs slid sideways out of the belt.
---
&gt; If they don't even mine the moon they hold it for ransom or demand rent.
---
It was like this with POSes too. Only before the holders could be a handful of alliance bigwigs and every moon make them fuck tons of Isk because it mined itself. 
---
Other than TZ tanking, which is a universal problem, I don't see any issues with the current system.
---
nah, politicians were always like that.

---
Literal answer: Because of bandwidth. It's got 100Mbit/sec and heavy drones require 25Mbit/sec each.  
---
Other answer: So there's a reason to buy a VNI or Ishtar.
---
&gt;Organization does not mean imbalance. Just because the goons can do it better than someone else because they are more organized than most does not mean something is imbalanced.
---
2 things
---
1. Balance has to encompass small as well as large groups. much like in otehr games things are balanced in terms of single character and team play. The team play equivalent is missing in Eve Online. It is clear that things were balnced for the small, but large scale it all went out the window.
---
2. I disagree with you. See Serenity as an example and ask yourself if this is truly what you want TQ to become, because I don't.
---
 the thumbnail looked like a bar somewhere, and I was all excited to see a real-life fight with your corpmates against some rando drunkards.
---
:)
---
Hmm, possible, but I do not think so, as the Molok was sold when the "diminishing return" was already published ...
---
Maybe this is just semantics, but I would consider a fax that has to inject for every tick of reps it delivers, to be "neuted out."

Why wouldn't a lobbyist be trustworthy?
---
No, seriously, I mean you know their bias going into it.  
---
They are literally a paid advocate so you can trust that their opinions, positions, etc. are all going to push in one direction.  A lot of lobbyists are absolutely positive forces.  Obviously this gets a bit into your political beliefs but as a supporter of say LGBT rights I'm certainly grateful for ACLU lawyers and lobbyists and the like.  Not all lobbyists are working for corporate entities at the peoples' expense.  
---
It's not like a maritime union advocate is a negative force in the world.
---
Tbf the wh meta has shifted to 250km booshing fleets where your faxes and carriers and dreads don't matter at all. 
---
Once booshing is nerfed, then faxes will regain their status as oppressive forces.

&gt;2015
---
Yeah, that'd do it.
---
Like I said, there are definitely places you can do it, but it's difficult from a management perspective. You're certainly not going to make enough to keep alliance services going. I know, we did it in 2018, and we managed about six months before the blob fell on top of us.
---
Heya!  So, I'm looking to get back into EVE, it's been YEARS.  However, the main reason I left is that I genuinely enjoy mining and refining, and generally don't like getting blown up, so I tended to stick to Scordite, etc.  In High-Sec.  (yes, you can see where this is going).   Aside from the yearly "Hulkageddon" which I basically just took a week-long siesta, is CODE still around?  Do you know of any concerted efforts to suicide-gank miners?  Any concerted trolling / griefing / ganking that's going on, or did they finally fix it?
---
To an AUTZ someone who has their timer in USTZ or EUTZ is also "timezone ranking". If you want the moon, fight them for it.
---
Will be back again this time :)
---
They've done worse.
---
It's a neophyte at the wheel.
---
The point is that even a completely neuted out FAX with injectors is still very difficult to kill.
---
Have you tried to git gud and fight them off?
---
Spoopy is recruiting btwbtw
---
i am of the opinion that 3200s are too powerful and if you nerf that, active fax become more vulnerable to neuts and thus sub cap fleets
---
What you describe was before the Phoebe patch and the jump range / fatigue changes. The moon mining &amp; content generation meta was at its peak between Phoebe &amp; Lifeblood, as Phoebe exactly countered and denied what you described. It was "bigwigs" before Phoebe (PL Kings of Lowsec, OTEC etc.) and after Lifeblood. In between groups like mine with 25 irl people had 10+ R64 Moons and could finance some nice outnumbered PvP with this ...
---
Marauders need some glory!
---
Must.  
---
Not.  
---
Click.  
---
Buuut I waaaanaaa soooo baaaad.
---
Well, this wouldn’t be the first time the GSM used CCP to rid themselves of a threat.
---
Stop? Why?
---
They could have also posted it on Reddit, as well as made a bug report!
---
Its called tranquility I think.
---
Ummmmmmmmmm
---
this is physics for me. I hate it.
---
If I'm wrong then I'm wrong, it's just my opinion.
---
Can it? Please?
---
Well, with the vast majority of CSM (GSM) being goons, it is most probable.
---
What exactly are you advocating? Filliments for battleships?
---
You mean to say this was all a lie about a lie that was being denied lying?
---
I too live in AZ. PH vs Brave fun fight irl?
---
Oh yes I remember that blops fleet.
---
Catching the Titans of both Sort &amp; Conman during hunting years

Go to null and kill their botters funding their nonsense
---
I'd watch that as well tbf
---
that happened yesterday
---
Not bad. 2 quick tips. When fighting that mach you could have MJDed out or even just warped at the end. He had dropped point.
---
Lol. Jumping off the tackle. Brilliant!
---
You can also use Evernus, but the guy developing it has since dropped support for it. https://evernus.com
---
If anyone is interested, I'm actually making a rewrite of evernus called REvernus, it literally has no features at the moment but if you want to follow development you can over at https://github.com/Meigs2/REvernus
---
I'm curious as to what features I should be adding first, so if you use Evernus regularly hmu
---
yep =)
---
And a purifier can hit moving tatget
---
It's not as bad as you would think
---
it was always too late, since tidi destroys the idealized version of what you want eve to be. it used to take you years and a bunch of money to figure this out, not you can do it with a bunch of money *today...* what a time to be alive right? nah, just walk away man, this game sucks
---
God knows logi wasn't holding shit. 
---
Saved a vulture and ferox. I don't think you primaried the logi because why bother when you're melting the DPS ships like that.
---
SPOOP HYPE
---
That's awesome. :p
---
Just need to throw about 400 rigor cats on your phoenix and you're good
---
God damn, what now? You shooting fingers everywhere?
---
The hell do you mean "surprised"?
---
I hear once you go into a black hole you never go back
---
Try reading that again. The whole point is that Brisc letting something slip to a non-goon CSM is "unlikely."
---
_"This one simple trick will make your penis impossibly long!"_
---
And, I guess, kill you. But whatever, right?
---
Well at least that should be an easy fix.
---
With a T1 Siege Module the cycle time is 2.7s. With a T2 Siege Module cycle time is 13.5s. (This is with 4x T2 Ballistic Control Units)
---
This might be caused by the Rapid Torpedo Launcher Bonus of the Siege Module. The Bonus is -90% for T1 and -50% for T2. This might result in about 5x longer cycle time for the T2 Siege Module.
---
Like other people here, I very much doubt CCP did not investigate and has made a decision and took this action lightly. they must have something concrete that is 100% valid. Also, no comments from Brisc yet today. there is a good possibility that him and CCP are talking, albeit, its a very delayed conversation due to timezones and CCP verifying or investigating further.
---
Who knows, if they are investigating maybe we'll get even more bans. More popcorn inc.
---
Try someplace other then Tama
---
I think you're confusing eviction meta for wh meta. And even then the "boosh" meta you refer to has only been employed in wh a couple of times. Since the command dessie introduction they've been used in our brawls, but as utility, rather than a defining platform in the meta.
---
Fortunately, content drivers in wh are generally not based around structure timers. People are usually keen to form and take a consentual fight just by virtue of being connected, rather than to defend their home or evict another group. 
---
More than any other factor, I would say it's this that makes wh-space so appealing to live in. Of course there are ganks, and evictions and timers etc, but that's the exception, rather than the rule, for content.

---
Yeah saw that, I feel stupid re-watching it lol :(
---
At the time I was just focused on keeping as much DPS as possible on the mach.
---
Wow, just how much planets has that thibg destroyed :o
---
You just need to practice mooning, that's all.
---
Do not recommend asking family though
---
Yikes
---
That’s the “feature” I requested, not a bug. 😂
---
?
---
The damage numbers match if you have no damage mods fit but are too low if you do. My guess is that the damage bonus counts towards stacking penalties
---
In the battle of UALX I was flying a hictor for the first time. When the goon armor titan fleets arrived from the north, I was the main in-cyno. Nothing like watching 250 supers apear on you from a single button push.
---
I still have that Phobos, too.
---
Holy shit I remember this story!
---
Nice job
---
Sounds awful.  But allow me to offer another pespecitve - 
---
Since the activity he discolsed with this 'backstab' was your spying/ambush, what your 'friend' did was literally tell the truth.  
---
While one way to describe what he did was 'backstab', that's what you were trying to do (to a group, not a person), so he effecitely stopped you from backstabbing a rival group, and his wepaon was the truth.
---
Don't get me wrong, if my RL friend did that, I'd probably wanna punch him in the face too, but you have to admit there is a certain irony here.
---
I've been living in wormholes since 2014; been mostly about the ganks for me. Hardly ever came across faxes in non-eviction scenarios, and now they don't matter in those scenarios anymore.
---
So nerfing faxes is moot as far as they are used in wormholes.
---
Pretty impressive, denying what I said and simultaneously proving it to be the case. And all in so few words!
---
thats where brisc lives
---
The ship in question is way bigger than a battleship, lol
---
What do you mean when you say the legal system doesn't work, because this is news to all the people who work in the legal field every day. :P
---
As a fellow newbro (as of Feb this year) I can tell you that you don’t need to worry about what other people are doing to have fun. 
---
I did the tutorials a few times on different characters to really nail down the basics. Essentially, you want to do the Seekers intro, then each of the career agents (they cover the different kinds of things you can do in eve) then the advanced military agent who gives you a pretty sweet ship at the end. 
---
All these tutorial missions give you a bunch of isk (in game money) and a good number of ships. Once you get a feeel for how the game works and how the universe is structured then you at least have a basis to figure out what you want to do. 
---
Oh, and never ever hesitate to look something up, as a question in rookie chat, or watch a video (I’m look at you probe scanning) because a lot of the mechanics are not very intuitive.
---
Maybe look into how many cap injectors you can put on. Aside from Faxs most fits don't use more than 2.
---
Doubt it. Initial trig speculations started when stuff started to appear in T5 Abyss sites. Then it all became public knowledge then videos and some announcements. To farm and hoard trig building mats cause new Trig ships are coming you do not need any extra info otehr then what is provided already. It is a given these are going to spike up in price when new ships launch.
---
At full tilt, sure. It would lack the alpha that makes dread bombs as scary, but if it can tank well enough, it could easily burn through structures and other piles of HP single-handedly
---
Yup, that's a DBRB slosh op right there!
---
Looks like Dark posted his Molok for sale 6 days after the winter summit.  Not sure if that matters, what was the nerf to the Molok?
---
Still better than 72 fat chicks cosplaying as princess Leia imho...
---
Yes it is too late, go play something else. The game is about to go down the drain when Pearl Abyss contract with CCP ends and they (CCP) get their money from the number of subs they are actively trying to manipulate...
---
UwU
---
Yeah for sure ;D but as a producer of corax since years i m happy :D
---
Personally, I think the barrier is shifting and the alternative for wh space (mass guardian wing or similar) is no longer viable.
---
Just taking a couple of our recent fights:
---
[3 Cap Brawl vs. LZHX's Leshak Comp](https://zkillboard.com/related/31002059/201903152300/) 
---
Granted this fight took place in a C5 Cat Var (Penalties to local rep) but even so, a mass Leshak form can field enough damage to spool through a triage's sustained local tank without allocating sufficient spool mitigation. 
---
[Subcap Brawl vs. TDSIN](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001437/201904032200/)
---
In this fight we didn't lose a single mainline subcap and the fight was over almost instantly because we fielded the utility (long range jamming kitsunes @110km) and the neuts (48km Optimal Abyssal Talisman Bhaalgorns) that rendered the hostile guardian wing completely ineffective, even though the hostile group brought more Leshak, Bhaalgorn and Logi. 
---
I would say we're still not in a perfect place with wh triage, but it's the best it's been in a long time.
---
the truth and curse of the sandbox.
---
everyone is free to do whatever. which means might makes right.  if they outnumber you, you can fight back. but in no way are you guarenteed to win, or get special advantages due to being outnumbered.  onyl way for small corps to win, is to get allies.
---
as for TZ tank....yeah fk TZ tank &lt;.&lt;
---
Pearl Abyss won't do that to a freshly purchased game, they will first milk every cent out of it so it will be years of P2W until keeping the server infrastructure is no longer profitable.
---
Lol ok.
---
It might. While the total EHP will remain within range of otehr dreads, remember Trig ships are all about armor, so their tank might be seriously increased due to not having an EHP divide between shield / armor but be focused.
---
&gt; It's not actually a nerf, because they will still mine well and just be more vulnerable to losses.
---
Well, they also nerfed the mining yield by 20%
---
You would too if you were a wormholer btw
---
Source : I'm a wormholer btw
---
Logi boson...
---
It could have been at the summit.  
---
I think it's unlikely even to a Goon CSM.
---
Wrote the "official" (published in EON magazine and used on the EVE official help pages) guide to the new scan probe system released in the Revelations update.
---
The magazine was set to release only a few weeks after the patch, they had some other guy who where supposed to write the guide for them but he failed to deliver. I had posted a guide on the forums so they asked me to rewrite it for the magazine and because of the tight deadlines I had only a few days to do so. The EON version was later published verbatim (including errors in the strength of some probes because I didn't have time to test it completely) on the official EVE help pages (this was before evelopedia). 
---
To my knowledge no other guide to that version of the probe system was ever produced, my guide held as the defacto guide for the 3 years that system was in use until it was replaced with the one we have today in the Apocrypha update.
---
Old forum guide https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=431586
---
For more than half that price you can run em in a Cerb with no implants.
---
What limits people in multiboxing anyway? My best guess is tedium in managing more accounts or hardware limitations.
---
Why didn't the guy who already has 20 Rorquals run 25 or 100 instead before the patch? 
---
I doubt just *everyone* will add 20% more rorqs to counter the nerfs.
---
Can't wait till i can use USD to buy things in game.  Then I can pay to win EVE!
---
 All info thus far indicate the triglavians are preparing an expedition into known space .That ship is more akin to what Jovian motherships were it's not just a massive weapon platform it's a mobile staging base too .
---
but what about Shintaht?
---
Well said.  Hope you're well, Sahara o7
---
 I wouldn't be surprised if it has among other thing a system or constellation jammer onboard
---
Ok how does having less rorqs in space provide more content.   
---
From my experience catching a rorq is possible due to siege timers but the little guys usually are gone before the bad guys hit system.
---
No the one time they did it to us we just titan DD’d the archon but that’s against the narrative so I didn’t include that note.
---
Hope you lot enjoy and like the BIG ALPHA :)
---
you laugh about sekrits but I was streaming with a 15 min delay and had to cut stream for opsec. it happens man.
---
It's not news to lawyers, they know very well or else they wouldn't have sought the job.  The fact that they don't give a shit just means they're all assholes and terrible people.
---
I think it’s a seige structure. Something you anchor to nuke other structures.
---
Approximately 64,695 lbs of shark fins is my favorite
---
 I think you're very right the triglavians are preparing for an armed expedition into known space so they needed a hefty yet mobile base of operations so they built one .Absolutely crazy
---
Not sure what you've been doing in the last 5 years but:
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/1538/losses/w-space/
---
Maybe if you're part of a smaller lowclass group you won't see them much, but they're pretty common in normal content in highclass. 
---
And they certainly will still matter, even in eviction scenario. Very very few groups, or even coalitions of groups in wh's can field sufficient numbers to use a boosh-doctrine effectively.
---
Corps are supposed to get started in Low Sec? News to me!
---
So many small details added into this to make it great- +1
---
It is not too late. Never will be.  But if you plan to rule the universe you better get started.  Eve is about carving your own story, setting your own goals. Most newcomers who think that they can spend some cash and suddenly be winning are in for a very rude awakening. 
---
Play, learn, ask questions. Give it a try. Best time to start is now. Tomorrow is good as well.  Three days from now?  I will be back in game and then . . .
---
m
---
oooh these glorious days &lt;3
---
paging /u/jibrish to pin this post, op is right - we need the lengthy good posts.
---
Remove Excavators. Give it enough yield with T2 drones to come just short of a Barge under boosts (so the boosting char get's something as well, but that's optional for all i care).
---
Maybe increase it's boost again a little, but not by 100%!
---
Dude seriously? Think about it for a sec. What help do you think would be on the way? You think a fax is just gonna yolo into a 100 man fleet to just sit there and be like "Haha try to kill me!" No and you're retarded if you think that. DPS bro DPS...Fax is the first to arrive to save the shit you're trying to kill followed shortly by dps to clear the grid. It gives the FC time to put together a proper fleet comp. Use your brain and stop making yourself look stupid.
---
Bcs killing defenceless rorqs all day long or not killing any bcs 10 titans are cynoed in once you touch them is boring maybe?
---
And endless supply of cheap titans is also probably boring?
---
Back in 2007 or so, an alliance called You What, had stations in outer ring, they moved them from one Corp to another but messed it up and the Corp it was transferred to wasn’t in the alliance that was holding the sov, so station became free for all.
---
I was in 0utbreak at the time and we were farming you what. We didn’t have an alliance though. So we could take the station but it wouldn’t be protected, for close to 24 hours we held the station by basically fighting off everybody trying to take it back, only when a GM came in local in a Polaris frig to attack it and take it (and told us not to interfere) did we lose it. 
---
RIP Captain Marcos seafood shack :(
---
I don't know, with the whole "corrupt GSM" prevailing narrative, I could see CCP wanting to prove that they care about corruption by making more of a stink about this one.
---
The difference being mine was a shitpost while you unironically grr spies buff bve
---
You share the blame buddy. That's the nature of a democracy -- you're responsible for making it work. Ain't nobody else gonna do it for you.
---
&gt;did they finally fix it?
---
Eve is a PVP game. There is risk whenever you are undocked.
---
Highsec has recently been better as war dec rules have changed to allow corporations to exist in high sec and be immune to war as long as they don't have structures.
---
What do y'all speculate Brisc Rubal leaked if anything?
---
well... thanks to leshaks it turned to an ok'ish place (fax selfrep that is)
---
on the other hand, thanks to leshaks you basically have to field a fax otherwise your guards just get shit on or arent even able to outrep the dps.
---
so yeah, while leshs are a godsend against faxes, im not to sure if im happy with the meta shifting to leshs only...

Right, but CCP said in their statement that the CSM had brought this to their attention so either it was a Goon-affiliated rep or one of the two(?) who aren't.
---
Haha yeah I’ll take you up on that next time I can make an EVE Vegas. Flights from Korea are $$$ though

---
I was not playing at the time but I would assume you could refit the archon to tank a DD without too much issue. Just shove some heated deadspace hardeners into the lows of the right type.
---
So funny story, I went to Fanfest last year, which was right when I think Asher deployed up north. I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt to Reikjavik and so my flight was with some Germanbois who happened to be in Chaos Theory. We started chatting up a bit about the war and they were extremely confident in being able to win. They kept repeating "Where are the goons? They just arent coming! They just dont come". Few weeks later iirc, is when GOTG lost their keepstars. I had a good chuckle.
---
Did you ever consider your shitpost was actually on point, if only by accident?
---
Only if you're delusional, sweaty &lt;3
---
If that was the case, then why only a 1-year ban?
---
Yeah groups like DT and Shadow held loads of valuable moons across lowsec. Many many cap brawls happened with other groups like DHSJ, Koreans and Amarr FW over those moons, a lot of which were taken with impunity from PL.
---
Simple question . . .
---
Do you think GSM  could not do a frame, if it suited their purposes?  
---
Follow up.  .  Do you think they would not do a frame if it suited their purposes?

It wasn’t an invasion until NC deployed over to help, then we were all *grr NC ruin good fights* and saw an opportunity to hit them hard. Up till then we were having a great time skirmishing GOTG but shit had to get serious so we dropped the hammer.
---
I personally, for some reason, decided it was my objective to implode Chaos Theory. I hellcamped all their systems and destroyed anything that moved if I could. Bigger things got the cyno. They never imploded and held together until after the war, but I’m fairly certain they crumbled not too long afterwards... vindication. Why you ask? They were not keeping up with their rent payable to the local BBTB Representatives and defaulted on their leasing agreements.

but dude, i just wanna see a stupid political wog do stupid political things and get stomped on by the legal system and mocked relentlessly by the rest of the community for it.
---
its the only real good form of entertainment left here, you know?
---
Just take some sov in the spire. The previous owners abandoned it
---
Indeed, been hype for it since I saw the CCP post on a forum about it.
---
But he was just talking hyperbole.
---
This.  CCP is a private company.  You have no property or other rights in your acoounts.  They shared more information than they needed to.

Fit?

I can't fly the cerb but if its good enough I might train caldari cruiset

It's not just semantics it's the difference between a ship that can't do anything and a ship that can run all its tank for 40 minutes.

until it dies the second it enters siege like any faction capital would
---
see, told ya
---
Yeah sadly we also have those one on reddit now
---
It's 100% within CSM politics though to fabricate false evidence against someone to get them and alliance FCs banned. We have to see how this story continue to unfold in game. Judgement day was also organized by other CSM people.
---
Tedium to profit ratio, for sure.
---
Someone who runs 20 rorqs can easily run 25, it's just a matter of the extra few rorqs being worth it. If you feel like you need to mine more to maintain your industry/lifestyle, people are going to make more accounts.
---
&gt;Why the hell i wasted years of life and game time for skilling and training capitals
---
 oh boy

&gt;Flying biggest toys around and not being able to kill a freaking no tank frigate is just a ■■■■■■■ joke.

This was quite a while ago. But I was the CEO of a corporation in provi. We decided to make a change and went into a C4. We found one that was occupied by a group that had an active POS. It was a small group of like 2 people. It was heavily armed, so we decided to being an Ishtar fleet (back when they were the shit). We were worried about all of the ecm on the POS. Turns out the idiots didn't set the POS up correctly and also did not stront it. So we took it down in one night and got like 5b in loot. We didn't last long in the whole since a lot of our guys turned out. It was fun though to do something on our own and to plant our own flag.

Congrats on getting a free to play game... free!

Question, why the thrasher?  I noticed you took down some bigger fish like a Confessor (t3 vs t1, I always thought a losing fight), and this video was really interesting to me, so thanks for posting
---
yeah i didnt really take into account stupidity my bad :p
---
OMG, it is so bad fitting  
---
Even before nerf he wouldn't kill that frigate
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Pretty impressive, so consistently saying nothing of substance! It must be nice to simply refuse to engage with anyone. It's must be much easier just to be a moron.
---
My point is that csm members should not get preferential treatment. If he's innocent then he can be reinstated like the others
---
I do love this fit.
---
I think the old pope needs to die first.
---
you don't actually get anything though :(

It's a feature.

That is true but I'd rather CCP stopped being overall shitty with their bans regardless of Brisc's innocence or not.
---
There is a *lot* of lowsec...go somewhere else(!)

Solution: more dps or energy neutralizers

This just sounds like you've got a personal story behind your salty attitude rather than any actual problem with the legal system.

&gt;It's not news to lawyers

Yes it is. You're talking to one.

But you have to be subbed on a single random unrelated day or you will get nothing.

Nice zkillfu.

But yeah, I've never been part of high class groups.

Moving there with the F-6 visa, I’m assuming you had that too? What’s your discord name in test, I’ll carry this convo there. You probably can give me some tips for a foreigner from the US moving there

Skill traders will just look at SP but everyone else considers skill books that are injected, implants, faction standings, character age &amp; name, even ship skins sometimes. 
---
There's a lot of untransferrable/permanent things associated with a toon that can make it valuable.
---
My former Corp was the original ones killing the first Mothership in lowsec. x13 was the Corp. 
---
And yes bump and next mechanics aswell as using own Mothership and dreads/carriers to kill it. 
---
No other way to kill it back then.

They can't spider rep... They can't rep each other while in triage, and if they're out of triage large reps are unironically better than capital reps.

Faxes are disposable heal machines. You jump overwhelming amounts of them in so that the enemy cannot DPS though whatever titan they were shooting and has to grind through your sea of fax machines first. 10/10 gameplay thanks CCP.

Got a ping for a join NC. fleet, which wasn't too specific but said that they'd be using something special, and that not everyone could expect to come. Fortunately I'd trained Thalias a week or two before this, so even though I had nowhere near the experience of anyone else there I could still come. 
---
We ended up facing off with a Brave caracal fleet on a jump gate in catch, neither of us wanting to jump in and start at a range disadvantage. However, by pure luck we caught a redeemer in the bubble the Sabre had dropped on us, and the Caracal fleet jumped in to try to save it. We eneded up taking 0 losses and killing both the redeemer and taking a good chunk out of the Caracals, although we did end up with one kiki at 13% structure.
---
Patch success!
---
Pity the forum police closed it so quickly...
---
No they can't.. if that answers your question sir.

Imagine eve without ships

Greatest fight of my eve life; https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/98gm5f/the_evolution_of_a_wormhole_pvp_noob/
---
It was a small 30 v 12 fight, where David beats Goliath against all odds.
---
I've been part of tidi fest 2000 man fights, but this small eviction fight was the most epic fight I've ever experienced.
---
Set up seat ..

If he was a sleeper agent they would've skipped the whole hands thing.

Not a 6month old player. 6month that I pilot a rorqual. And you can easily hop in a rorqual After two years of playing, not sure what you've done during those 6years
---
Whenever it is you can expect it to be roughly 10-30% worse than the previous event. A trend CCP would like to continue. You will just lose isk participating, whatever it is.
---
I swear I only ever heard them referred to as TEST back in '10.  Took a long break from the game, see people referring to TAPI, who the fuck named themselves after Microsoft's Telephony Application Programming Interface?  Oh.  It's just TEST.

Have you compared global events when America has a Democrat vs Republican in power?
---
Democrats increase global aid, use small task forces to try and handle global threats, form trade ties and collaboration. This aims to empower global workers and stabilize global economies to raise human development and quality of life. 
---
When a Republican is in office, it's us vs them. Global aid and trade are removed. We invade countries with a massive military and indiscriminately bomb targets. Quite literally American generals have to step in and rule a carfully approach to orders and demands from the president's wishes. Literally the economy sags, isolationism rises, local warlords around the world gain more power against their own people. 
---
I saw a lot of changes better Bush and Obama in global hostility was striking. Republicans act like they know better than military leadership, or any expert advice and demand everyone to fall in line with zero qualifications or understandings. 
---
The glob needs to unify against this crap we keep seeing crop up around the globe. Authoritarian bullies that lie, cheat and steal to grab power and wreck lives for personal gain.
---
Dude, EVE is the best game that has ever been made. It will be too late to join only once and if it shuts down, which I don't think is going to happen because \[refer to beginning of paragraph\].

Excuse me CCP?  I'd like to report a [hate crime](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/de/af/ad/deafadd0e8f0ce2bb8a48fe2a01f4403.jpg).
---
1. You come to EVE to have fun [you’re going to find lots of arguments by bittervet executives, say: ProGodLegend, for whom EVE is a combination of masturbation and flagellation at the same time, yet: you don’t have to do what they do or what they say]
---
2. You do what you want to. You don’t have to fly with the big dogs until you are ready for ‘something more’. That may even be flying with ProGodLegend, especially if you like pain while having sex
---
3. You will -**never**- give money to an entity named ‘CODE’. Seriously, don’t do it. You’re your own pilot, you owe nothing to nobody
---
4. EVE is an over abundance of riches to explore and things to try. If you don’t like one thing, try another. There’s no shortage of things to enjoy
---
5. You’re going to lose ships [it’s not a guess, it happens to everyone]. You’re not getting the ship back. What was on it is lost. What was in it is [potentially / partially] lost. You will not complain, you will not mope, you will not rage. First of all: people like that you do that and they will do it for that reason alone, so don’t give them that extra joy. Second: there is never a shortage of ships. There never was, there never will be. Take another ship, carry on. 10 million ISK seems a lot today, it’s not even a rounding error for an experienced pilot
---
6. You come to EVE to write your own story. Everything you do in EVE is lore by default. If you don’t break the EULA, if you’re good or bad, if you want to embrace the experience, you’ll get more out of it than you put into it, because it’s one hell of a great place to be, if you can find it
---
Welcome to EVE!
---
You goddamn right!
---
You can make any mistake you want in EVE but you should know that you’re going to be heckled mercilessly for it.
---
It’s all part of the territory.
---
&gt; it was always too late, since tidi destroys the idealized version
---
You are completely ignoring the new developments with the new server infrastructure CCP are testing that can have thousands of ships in system and fight without lag.
---
Slippery pinkies
---
I saw some references to Easter on hoboleaks, so my guess is it will start next Tuesday, the 16th.
---
Didn't know Doom wrote for that site.
---
Can this be used on an existing account (who never used one before) or new accounts only?
---
My Tornado's heavy artillery doesnt care if you've been playing for a week, or a decade. So neither should you.
---
sheesh, this is gonna put pressure on him for real life due to publicity. and force him to lash out.
---
CCP should have kept it quiet, banned him and moved on.  
---
nowadays, saying anything is like using a megaphone.
---
Had a great fight against you like usual and great video as usual! Can't wait to see what you are in next. This combo was pretty nasty! 
---
If you wanna come to a NPSI fleet with us one day hit up our public, we would love to have you.
---
To be fair you never paid me rent so gimme some cash or I make olmeca go away.
---
Goddamn awful article, full of immature metaphors shoehorned in really weird places.
---
I encountered and bumped a freighter with a Basilisk BPO, resulting in its prompt destruction by Goons. It still can be considered one of the most valuable ganks in history.
---
So YOU'RE the guy we can blame for breaking the server, lol
---
Think my biggest accomplishment was being know in Eve as a trusted 3rd party and still am. 
---
Took me ages of time to build up. And to this day in still proud of it. Unfortunatly most of the business went away after the Keepstars. 
---
But I'm still contacted by other middle man tasks. 
---
Other than that... I'm proud that I actually sacrificed my Titan in the fight in Uemon. Who's fight and date is rarely mentioned anywhere as a big thing. 
---
But that fight started the whole invasion of Germinate and later Vale then Tenal/Branch and Tribute. 
---
Raiden. Was prolly the best accomplishment I was part of and also helped plan the founding parts of the alliance.
---
Iceland huh?  Too bad the game servers are in London...
---
Sad but true. The events just keep getting worse.
---
I was thinking about the Triglavians invading K-space and blowing shite up, would be fun.
---
k i'm just gonna put this here again.
---
Sure, this is a game, it's not as important, it's not 'criminal' and it's a private company, so these things don't matter as much as proper evidence in a real life infraction, but it still remains true that evidence is important for establishing guilt and it's still better to reserve judgment or assume innocence until you've seen some proof.
---
I don't see why not, plenty to do and explore. The best part is the community, worst part is the community as well
---
lol, ok that was a good one
---
Lol.
---
How does one get free paid services
---
Hopefully he doesn't turn to drugs
---
I don't know about other members but what got me concerned here was Pando being involved, granted I don't really know the guy (nobody really 'knows' anyone in EVE unless you know them IRL, and even then, you still don't really know them in EVE..), but I do find it hard to believe he'd be involved in any of this. He's genuinely one of the nicest and most straight and narrow people I've ever met in gaming period, let alone EVE.
---
Never too late.
---
new account only, this is the catch
---
"Evidence is important for establishing guilt"  
---
"Lol."  
---
We grug gang now. Apple tribe. Brisc do fire walk to prove innocence. If his feet burn, he guilty.
---
....*puts engines on iceland*  RAM DA LIMEYS, STEAL DA SERVER MATEYS!
---
I mean, he's not wrong. But keep circle jerking about how a class of caps is next to useless now outside of shitty pve I guess.
---
Why bring a carrier to a cap brawl anymore? Their dps vs caps sucks. Bring dreads.
---
Why bring a carrier to a subcap brawl anymore? They can barely apply damage. Bring haw dreads.
---
But thank God they can still be used to bash structures and kill red triangles!
---
Anyways, you whiny subcap faggots that were too dumb to shoot fighters should be happy now so eve should be much better.
---
You should start crying about dreads next since they're pretty much the answer to everything.
---
Olmeca already went away, grrr bubbles grr diamond rats
---
and you have to be subbed when they decide to give it out.
---
That would definitely be epic.
---
Again, we're not the ones that needs to establish guilt.
---
Ccp is, we're not entitled to the dokuments that lead to that conclusion
---
Brisc can take it to court trying to claim they hurt his reputation, then they would need to present proof.
---
There is no reason for us not to trust CCP, they have nothing to gsin from banning two content creators and one wanna be space important.
---
fucking lawyers
---
Yup, but you've got to watch out for disgrunted lawyers and politicians
---
I've thought about it and there really is no outcome that isn't entertaining for me.
---
I always had some personal doubts about the dual web thrasher fit. After all, it's a *pointless* fit
---
has anybody tried it ? What stuff it gives to new account except skill points ?
---
Yes, I play Eve Online too.
---
&gt;can barely apply
---
&gt;haw dreads
---
I see people asking this all the time, and I'm a member of a (prominent) new player corporation. I see day 1 players have just as much fun as day 700 players (and still having an impact). If you're interested in the game, just try it out (and definitely join a large new player corp) and see how you like it. All new player corps worth their salt should hand out free low-SP ships, or offer some way of getting them (replaced) for cheap, so even if you're completely broke you should be able to have fun and see what the game is like.
---
Entitled, no. They're a private company and the documents, if disclosed in their entirety, might violate privacy concerns.  
---
Still, ANYTHING elaborating on this would be great. Since this is the first time they've ever essentially named and shamed someone who was permabanned, on their website, and given that this guy's real life identity is tied to this, I think an exception can be made about discussing bans here, since they already established a first by naming him and announcing the permaban.
---
Yeah and thats fcking retarded for a 'hurr durr no changes only Titans'  change.
---
So many morons posting that you get nothing, impressive.

Be careful. It's very easy to stuff too much value into a freighter and get suicide-ganked. Freighters are optimized for hauling items that are large relative to their value. The stuff in your "house" is very likely the opposite.
---
If you evade a ban and play the game that leads to a permanent ban (at least on paper).

I just think we're all better off with some more caution when it comes to shooting our mouths off about matters to do with the legal system. Even a senior and experienced lawyer might not be able to say a damned thing about this that is true. People specialize in their careers.

Just... Don't listen to lawyers. On the internet especially. I know a few. They're full of shit.

I'm reminded of a family lawyer I know (divorces, custody battles, basic property law) that stuck their nose into a commercial matter and ended up getting their pants sued off and was almost disbarred.

So, about a year ago we were bashing some astrahus in a WH, I can't remember why, and one of our guys mentions that he is watching this streamer sitting in an orca talking about how he was doing a run to move stuff into a WH for his corp mates. We quickly figure out he is in Jita because while his opsec was quite good, he undocked at one point, only go dock back up to pick up more stuff, and it was kinda hard to miss that he was on the Jita undock. We happen to have an exit relatively close by and because I'm not being particularly useful (2000 HAMs don't last long in a tengu if you are shooting a structure) I decide to go to Jita and see if this turn into something. Maybe I can find his home hole and we can catch a ratter or something. So I follow him with my tengu, getting lucky couple of times as I manage to guess which gate of a possible few he goes through. and eventually I follow him to Nourvukaiken. I'm not paying too much attention to where I am though until he warps to a station and then to the Tama gate. At this point I can't believe he is about to do what I think he is, and I accidentally warp to the gate too early and end up jumping before him (this leads to a beautiful moment where he sees me on his stream, hovers over me, and says "Oh look, a tengu") At this point I'm convinced this guy can't be this stupid and that this is some sort of trap. I was still relatively new to hunting and this was so far out of what I'd ever seen that I was way more worried about it then I needed to be. So he jumps in after me and is about 6km away, and though I'm still freaking out because it's Tama, and I have no idea what to expect if I fight an orca on a gate. On the other hand this guy jumed jumped an orca into Tama, so I decide to go for it. We end up [killing him](https://zkillboard.com/kill/67460345/), and because we leave the wreck his corp mates make several tries to salvage their stuff, [They feed to us until we are forced off by Black Rise Matters](https://br.inyour.space/?s=2813&amp;b=7919040&amp;e=90&amp;t=KvPzf). 
---
At this point we realize the exit to their chain is in Tama, and and decide to start rage-diving until we find their home, as he is in dire need of an "extended delivery  contract". We get there only to find that apparently not only do the locals own an azbel, but there is an astrahus belonging to a goons corp in there as well.  At this point we are looking to kill their azble, because 1. we are going through a phase of blowing up structures that look like good targets, and 2. we've never killed an azbel before. We learn that Goons are in fact, [not friendly](https://zkillboard.com/kill/67486129/) with the locals, and we decide to get out resident Goon spy involved and to see if they can get a in contact to figure out what is going on. I never learn the reason, but apparently Goons wanted to evict this guy and asked that we leave because they didn't want us to get involved. Most of us do, though some us stick around to see if we can find any targets of opportunity,[which we do](https://zkillboard.com/kill/67569772/). The first bash [is successful](https://zkillboard.com/related/31000562/201801260400/), with minimal resistance, but word gets out that the locals have contracted Holesale to help in the next bash. At this point we are asked if we would be interested in showing up in longbows to help attack the structure as we had already expressed interest in shooting it. We say yes, and I get to lead my first longbow fleet. The [second timer](https://zkillboard.com/related/31000562/201801270400/) is won, and I learn a valuable lessons in pretending to be an x-mas light, and make sure you don't accidentally approach a large structure. The only issue is that neither us nor the Goons have much in the way of tackle as the PDS has rendered our lone saber ineffective, so we mostly just killed what was foolish enough to not align before breaking tether.  When the time comes for the third timer however no one bothered with hole control. This, combine with an unfortunate number of the Goons pilots podding themselves back to Delve to jump clone back later, us not using doctrines, and Holesale dropping a fleet of Slephnirs, means we [lost the fight](https://zkillboard.com/related/31000562/201801280300/) before we could even shoot the structure.
---
This is where I drop out of the op, but the story doesn't end here. Deciding they can't get help fro Holesale forever, and hemorrhaging members, the locals decide to pick up shop and move elsewhere. However, a disgruntled member learns the timer of the unanchoring structure and decides to give away the information before he leaves. The structure gets stolen and I'm fairly certain is lost within the sea of structures that is Delve to this day.
---
it doesn't give anything, even if you buy the pack
---
Well it's only for starting new accounts.
---
props to your balls dude
---
Well, the answers speaks for one point of view, but as a f1 monkey whaler myself and dealing with a small community within eve, the consensus is somewhat different. But different tastes, different opinions i guess. Still no need to go monkey "ooo, look at this madman's salt" ;)
---
Until it makes Adbusters it's not a story.
---
Someone once gave me their alliance industrial "doctrine" because I asked for it (I hadn't, but as I was running an indy corp at the time, I didn't mind the free advice).
---
I'll share it when I get home.
---
Yes.
---
Always good advice. Never know who's sitting by a popular gate looking like a newbro but actually passive targeting, scanning, and logging gate traffic.
---
o7 bro!
---
GF frat and PL I'm the pilot that lost all 3 of those rorqs. caught me with me pants down. that will not happen again. o7 no hard feelings honestly it was a great play from your side a lot of moving parts. I'm glad you guys pulled off that back door rag ops with Elo's alt. not sure how you next ops like that will go. GF ♥
---
Yes, and no. Love giving talks, and interacting with people - so a lot of the materials is always ready. That said, I don't like to repeat things, so I try to come up with new ideas each time.   
---
This one seemed like fun. Startup entrepreneurs try so hard to create efficient companies, and I find that often EVE Corps are better at it :) Even played around with the idea of using EVE as a hiring tool for my real business.
---
Thank you! Will be a great example.
---
Old topic, but for me it was being part of the group which discovered the bug that enabled you to have perfect tracking, perfect range (grid size) and lock range (grid size).
---
Unfortunately we only used it for a few months as a bigger entity tried to evict us and for defense we had to use it. CCP claimed no knowledge of it despite in-game tickets but none were banned or had any backlash.
---
Was fun and probably something I'll never get to do ever again. For a while, after I left, some corps would not let me join due to it. Good times.
---
The friend of my friend is my friend
---
Sweet. Shit fit a T1 sedan and I'll meet you on the 101.
---
I think I cannot oblige that request , thank you.
---
&gt;Anyways, you whiny subcap faggots
---
That pretty much invalidated everything you had to say, not that you needed the help.
---
Hahaha fair enough
---
Lmao at whatever buttmad baby is downvoting. Anyone sharing fits and discussing gets an upvote.
---
naw man here what you do you just buy some plex and then skill injectors and you be all set!
---
No shit, but people win court cases even though they're guilty all the time.
---
Anchoring and leading a logi wing for the first time, probably the most sustained stress I've endured playing this or any other game. I'm not an important person in any way and likely never will be, I just fly in fleets and gangs a lot and have flown logi for years.The feeling of having a pack of nerds in any fleet faithfully following me and my instructions is special to me, as nerdy and dumb as that sounds.
---
*looks at construction*  how about the 51
---
Going from catch meatshield to legacy drone, very cool!
---
Ive got some lovely cache side property I am willing to sell.
---
&gt;Fax is the first to arrive to save the shit you're trying to kill...
---
&gt;...followed shortly by dps to clear the grid.
---
You know that saving rorquals and ratting supers aren’t the only things FAX do, right? Some people actually go into a fight with FAX as their primary logistics platform. 
---
However, depending on the group you’re in its entirely possible to forget that FAX aren’t just ratters’ insurance policies.
---
so what ur saying is. Smartbomb the shit out of u guys?
---
you misspelled Brisc Rubal.
---
Nope, tried this recently amd couldn't cap him out.
---
Well.
---
Carriers have high scan resolution (you can lock subcaps before downtime), can lock anything they see, launch fighter squads which keep up with interceptors, and apply natively to larger subcaps (haven't played in a while so don't remember where the limit is).
---
Dreadnoughts have atrocious scan resolution, are limited to 300km range, have shorter-range guns than that, have tracking comparable to battleships. Oh, and they have to immobilize themselves for five minutes to get any sort of DPS.
---
Not to mention, the fit in the original thread was pretty bad. I don't know what application carriers have natively, but the OOP didn't help matters by using only one of the worst tracking mod available.
---
In short, do your homework.
---
Yup, this is legit - 100% discount for a while to kick off the new starter pack.
---
Right now though, our system has overloaded itself because of new account creation, so it's going to take some time to deliver all the goodies.
---
Anyone who creates a new account will get all their stuff within the next 48 hours :)
---
Oh yeah, the time before tidi with all the server crashes and blackscreens was so much better. Fuck off retard.
---
I'm a few jumps out. Be there in a minute.
---
For reference: The theorized “supermassive blackhole” titled Sgr A*, at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, is 4 million times the mass of our sun. 
---
According to NatGeo, and nasa.gov, the supermassive blackhole at Messier 87’s heart is 6.5 billion times the mass of our sun. 
---

It's better to use this set up or a Corm because the rails fire so much faster than artis. Also with the Corm you can fit a MWD while fitting the largest rails.

Anyone feel sad looking at something you can never reach...
---
wtf this was secret...
---
Shame, I was known as WNxSystem
---
Not init(anymore) and not salty.. you are just insinuating a lot. I made a few relatively neutral statements, and you are reaching for something that isn’t there.
---
i didnt say it was, mr. hotpants. but tidi still kills eve, regardless of it being better than a straight up crash.
---
what about my alpha legion of like 1 month old accounts?
---
Sorry buddy?
---
God what happened to Opsex? :(
---
hey dude and glad you enjoyed the vid. The reason I use the thrasher is because artillery are insane on it 2k volley+ and with dual webs you generally apply fully meaning it makes quick work of active tanks. Reason I chose this offer something more dps heavy is because most stuff I want to engage would prob tank me i.e. jags have insane tanks only way to break one solo in a destroyer is volley damage or neats in my opinion sure they are other ways but most evolve short range guns which are easy to range control. Hope that answers your question friend.
---
It's called bring neuts/focused voids if you want kill caps
---
Yeh man is very satisfying :)
---
Welcome to the internet 2019.
---
Thanks dude yeh weird to see one like that in lowsec althought its the same one i run. I like an mwd on my lowsec wolf :)
---
Cheers mate and was a great fight :) will give the NPSI Fleet a thought cheers.

Not to mention that people quit subscribing all the time. I've got a character from 2005 with way fewer skill points than you'd expect.

---
Pull the fight away from the fax in that case, it's immobile in triage, use command destroyers, use high alpha doctrine, do what you need to do.
---
LOL :) not gona lie tryed for like 10mins to come up with a puny response nothing was coming to me.
---
My mining barge did the opposite. I couldn't see the lasers or strip miners although I was mining
---
oh so the solution to the problem after all these years is just a few patches away?  honestly if you want to believe a damn word CCP says about anything, that's your choice.  on the other hand I think you're an idiot to think after all these years, the solution to the problem is just around the bend... the bend which just so happens to extend past the point where CCP finally hands everything over to Pearl Abyss, right?
---
Did they end up killing any freighters?
---
Pretty sure this is only for brand new accounts.
---
I assume this only applies to new accounts? Can it be combined with the recruitment rewards as well?
---
I hear you but its more about the alpha than the rof in this fit the mwd could be cool to with a long point but for what im tryiny to achieve with this fit mwd isnt really needed.
---
Cheecky little sebo?
---
Yoink. Thanks for the free stuff.
---
I got into eve from steam, i havent experienced a single problem and the bundle (winter sale 2017) was like 20 bucks for 3 omega months with 1100 plex. Much better than not using steam. Also this free boost is nice.
---
Well.. he said that after joining PL as well. That PL would be his last alliance...
---
You don't use a point.. The idea behind the dual mwd web corm is to let them burn into you and by the time they realize they are dead it's to late..
---
The mwd is only to keep them from getting into scram range.
---
YMMD
---
Not all. INIT. Was on our side
---
If so, Make 100+ steam accounts, get cerebral accelerator. Profit.
---
So...he didn't like the patch?
---
Obviously it is POSSIBLE to kill a fax with subcaps, though the effect of nuets is arguable with quad capital cap boosters. What I am saying is that it shouldn't be that difficult from a balanced fun gameplay perspective. There is absolutely no good reason fax are as powerful as they are at stifling subcap content when it comes to active fax. 
---
A 3 bil ship that instantly teleports negating the dps of an entire 100 man ferox/munnins/eagle fleet and also being unkillable by said fleet is not good for the game. 
---
The answer can't be bring 30bil in dreads... 
---
This isn't even just a roaming content issue. In the recent fight over the Camal Keep Imperium forces which were approx 1k players albiet in jackdaws and crap struggled to kill the 4 fax brought to counter them. They are simply too good at what they do both negating massive dps on targets and themselves.
---
Sure if CCP is completely braindead and made the shit tradeable.
---
MY CARRIER WAS FIT WITH THE FOLLOWING
---
The last one lost you  more money the more you played it unless you hit the jackpot on the crates you opened which the majority of players did not The folks in my corp that tried it out lost a few hundred mill a piece opening crates before giving up. At least in frostline you could farm skins and the mobs dropped useful hacker, BCU and mining mods.

As a newb years before skill injections, flying my first battle cruiser, a dual rep tech 2 fit brutix with rails. Another "newb" named Mintchip Lol asked me to help him try his tank out on his Tristan. 
---
Warped to him way away from gates and we dueled. Innocent newb I was, I was frankly shocked when he shot down my drones and kept boring into my poor brutix. He was laughing and talking about joining the tuskers and needing kills in smaller ships than what he killed.
---
I kept one rep running constant and then cycled the second one, proceeded to get drunk(er) and we kept talking while he blazed away. We were laughing and told him i was running cap boosters when I wasn't. He wanted me to pay him to let me go. I just laughed and kept repping.
---
Eventually he just left. Got bored.😁 we wished each other well.
---
As a newb I was proud af. Survived my first shenanigans in EVE.
---
I'll tell you about the shitfit thorax I lost to a slasher in lowsec sometime.  I want a rematch Rakanar. 😁
---
Does it really put out enough DPS with just a single DDA and drones alone ? And what happens when the Tengu starts to just shoot the drones ? I could see it being succesful if it also has some sleepers on it, but otherwise ?
---
wrong, as a goon i module click and can't physically press 2 buttons at once

huh? what? who?

They pretty much died after the Fountain war though, it took them a long time to get back to relevancy.

Sooooo, hes saying to kill all the freighters
---
I remember that! Those forum threads were a lot of fun :)

I’m going to intentionally not pay you because he was my entertainment and I wouldn’t have to deploy in order to make people salty.

I've been playing for a year and half, in that short time, I've skilled into most subcap doctrines, as well as carriers and dreads, and trained up a rorqual/logistics alt. With the help that you will get if you join a decent group, you will progress quickly. You can even start as a free alpha account, as I did. This game has so many ways to play: you could go mainstream, join a nullsec corp, or a high sec mining/industry group, join a faction warfare/lowsec pvp group, go to wormhole space, or just sit in jita playing market games. Explore what you want to do, make sacrifices for your organization if necessary, but always stay grounded on what you find fun, whether that's mining/building, participating in huge fleet fights, or killing solo roamers/drone booshers. Eve is what you make it.
---
I’d imagine it’s more or a PvP thing.

Yep, my thought is to lock and apply as quickly as possible.

Not only does it have the docking light lines, but there's a hologram of a bunch of hexagons, which all citadels have.

quoting prequel lines in the eve subreddit, you are a bold one
---
Yes I am aware of that, but the same shit applies. Fax either arrives at the same time as DPS or Just prior. Keep in mind OP was talking in regard to a single fax sitting on grid able to rep a 100 man fleet of whatever the hell the fleet was in. That implies a save not a fleet fight.
---
You know how to fit and where to go to get those kills because of experience and skill. Just saying...

How am I supposed to do flips n shit on Fw nerds then
---
Theoretically less Rorqs will eventually put some pressure on cap production thus proliferation thus downgrading effectiveness of cap umbrellas a bit. Hence more content. 
---
However in practice, the changes we are getting are inadequate for the task. They really would have to be nerfed into near uselessness, wait a bit until cap stockpiles get depleted to whatever is the target level, buff the Rorqs back but not to the effectiveness which they have now.
---
Ok buddy, go get Pyfa and come up with application fit carrier, then compare to haw dreads.  
---
Or run tests on Singularity. We can solve this empirically.
---
I'm on mobile, if you know a good fitting site link it here and I'd be glad to do it myself.
---
What does any of this have to do with Sonic 3 though?
---
proh god*
---
With the April update, is solo Rorq mining still viable? I have spent a long time saving isk and investing skill points to be able to fly it soon and reading the changes were a bit disheartening.
---
I'm suprised people still remember and comment about when BOLD destroyed blue freighters, feels like ages ago, good times though :D

At least he fit a cyno...
---
When I really started to primarily do solo pvp I got increasingly frustrated with stabbed farmers. I started to just camp their sites cause I was tired of thinking I might have had a fight only for them to warp out while point. Eventually, I made dedicated fits to catch them, including fitting plates for more mass so I could bump them out of capture range. 
---
So they couldn't go be cancer somewhere else I'd hold them as long as possible, for some reason some people wouldn't self-destruct. 
---
Due to the time it took to look up everyones killboards when I was rolling around with my stealth bomber fitted with two faction points and a sebo, I eventually made something that scraped zkillboard and flagged people with stabs fitted so I could then just copy/paste local and check my own database. Eventually warp speed was an issue(which caused me to later use hyperspatials when they eventually got introduced) since I knew if there were offenders in local or not after a few seconds. 
---
By the point of the tool had been made I been doing this for a few months now, between my normal frigate PvP where I'd build a standings list and locator those who were online after I was done roaming and wanted to hunt warp stab users. 
---
A month or two afterwards of the tool being completed I had started to add PvP related trackers such as people who also hunted stab users so I could convo them, offer SRP and provide my tool if they were interested. 
---
At one point some people who would recognize my ship name/character would comment about not seeing as many stabs because I started just roaming looking for stabs with every one of them on the watch list. I do miss the enjoyment I had theorycrafting different fits and then seeing if anything was noticable.

I liked it, thanks

Also that my laziness made me find market trading and essentially let’s me focus on playing the game rather than grinding and I feel a bit of pride because I went from seeing 1-2bil as the holy grail of wealth to a relatively minor sum and that a lot of people I’ve advised to take up trading said they’ve tried but the can’t make it work so I take a bit of pride in this too

Boi you gotta be quick to sell some before market balance itself back

---
I've got a couple, but the more I think about this thread, the more this particular incident makes me chuckle:
---
I had just started my corp. In this iteration of the corp and its ideals, we were a highsec mining corp. Super boring, but super easy for me to run by myself. I was primarily recruiting new players, and the goal was to actually get them financially stable enough so we could roam and do pvp. 
---
Well, the pvp came a lot sooner than I anticipated. One new player wanted to see what various things looked like, and warped to a POCO. 
---
Almost instantly, the owners of that POCO were in our public channel demanding his head. Apparently, they had just set it up, and thought we were going to attack it. I got in, and started countering all their bs, with my cold, calm attitude. 
---
They start telling me "Oh, we'll mail your CEO, and tell them that you, the director, are refusing to pay us, and threatening us" etc. My alt is the CEO character.
---
So I login as that character, say the same thing in the public chat, and kick their entire alliance from the channel. 
---
Naturally they wardecced us, but coming from null, I didn't care. We played games with them. Living in their home system for a week, trash talking them, denying them kills, it was glorious. 
---
I believe we got one or two kills on them, and they got none on us. 
---
I have other moments, but they're all fairly similar to that, minus the actual agression on us. Turns out, people talk a big game, but when met with opposition, they'll crumble. 
---
On that topic: before I decided to close the doors on my corp, we had moved into a wormhole. Someone a few months down the road also decided to move in as well. So we reinforce their raitaru. He messages me saying how he and his corp will evict us if we continue attacking the raitaru, and if we dont lower poco taxes to 0%. I simply said "Do it."
---
He never did, and also is now -1 raitaru.
---
Boohoo

I’m proud of many things in my EVE Career. But the crown jewel of my pride is that I took eve online as a challenge! I actually feel like sharing my story here, hope you guys enjoy reading it =D
---
My English was really really poor back then, but I kept trying to read about EVE Online. I spent weeks translating stuff, watching videos, Until I decided to download the game. I spent a lot of time in hi-sec. slowly tried to figure out eve. Got accepted Into some random corps, was really shy to use the mic at all. Got kicked a lot lol. Until I found my way to null sec. I remember using team speak for the 1st time, then the CEO saw my country’s flag “Saudi” and got very curious and asked if I was working there etc. I explained that I am a Saudi, So he kicked me LOL (if you’re somehow reading this, thank you for kicking me, it made me meet better people) and years after, I found my self in Brave! It was a game changer, met so many nice people who helped me grow my English and lose the fear of talking in comms “I stutter a lot” , and then I somehow got recruited into Brave Operations - Lollipop Division.
---
I was hyper active, everyone gave me a hard time “in a funny way tho” they took care of me. They never allowed anyone to bully their Saudi friend “except themselves lol” and the whole Brave community kinda treated me as a special snowflake for some reason xD so I got attached to the EVE community as a whole. Then became an officer in BOLD, to an Eu MilDir. We left to infamous, had good times, but I stayed in touch with Brave a lot and recruited people for them even after we left. we then moved a couple of times, to end up in Brave again. (Thank you Brave, without you, we would have been dead) I was a Director at this point. The Brave Diplo team were looking for someone to help, And Professor Push nominated me! Thus I became an Alliance Diplo woot woot “it was hectic, but I enjoyed it, it also allowed me to meet and become friends with a lot of people from different alliances” and then asmodean gave me BO-LD’s CEO! 
---
And nowwww, we’re in TEST! 
---
So I’m really proud of my career despite it being humble. I’m proud that I made friendships from all over  the world, I’m proud that I did my best to revive BOLD after so many hardships, and I’m so fucking proud that my English got way better compared to 9 years ago. 
---
EVE Online’s community made me grow as a person, enhanced my rl career “Excel sheets man, and English”, and gave me confidence to speak up, lead, and be who I am without being shy whatsoever.
---
So, yea.. that’s my Story. ^_^ I sincerely love you all.

Funnily enough, in the US anyway one of the most popular government changes (term limits) is the one that also empowers lobbyists the most as most legislators don't actually have a large staff of subject matter experts to advise them on the effects or implications of policy changes and so it frequently does end up falling to issue-advocates / lobbyists and that's exponentially more true when the legislators are new to the body and don't have the experience or network connections to rely on less biased or agenda-driven information sources.
---
I'm bad at interpreting tone, but in case you're serious, multiple people did, and posted here as well. I think someone from CCP may have even responded and said they were aware of the bug, which makes it particularly confusing to me.

I’m saying: CCP always has the great potential to make good decisions, it just takes them far too long to get there, if ever.
---
EVE could have been so much more and so much better if CCP actually understood their own creation better. They have listened to a few things I said, it took years, but such a wealth of ideas I have to make their universe better, is far too much for them to do anything with.

Is Shines’ « smoking gun transaction » the Molok sale? I didn’t know that. When has it been said?
---
So... if I understand correctly: 
---
- Brisc mentioned to Pando that CCP was working on a faction Titan nerf. 
---
- Pando tells it at some point to Shines
---
- Shine sells his Molok
---
But... why is Pando banned? He isn’t bound by a NDA. He didn’t profit from the transaction in any way or form...
---
If this is what happened, then Pando should be unbanned. Under the assumption of this scenario, he didn’t do anything that remotely qualify as bannable. 
---
Brisc opened his mouth too much, Shines avoided loss of ISK (= gain) by selling his Titan before the nerf. But what did Pando wrong ? Did he « profit from a crime »?
---
Nope. 
---
On the other hand... who, on the CSM, would profit to headshot INIT?
---
To defeat older players you have a variety of options. Like becoming very good in flying a set of particular ships. It doesnt take long to train into specialization for a few ships. 
---
You can join a group and be strong in numbers.
---
You can get rich(er) just by finding items you can buy for a low price and sell for a higher price. Either by making buy orders or buying items in one region cheaply and transport them to other regions where you can sell for profit.
---
Aside of the competitive aspect there are tons of things you can do to have fun. You always get better in the process.
---
Also take into account that almost all players take breaks from the game, sometimes for years. While you play, you're always catching up to thousands of other players who are on a break.
---
Good luck.

Because he also had said he'd spoken to experts in their field to get information to help the CSM. If that person was Pando (the third person revealed), Brisc would know what he'd asked and that he'd been fucked by Pando's desire for ISK. To still claim he did nothing wrong suggests that he believes that other CSM members also go to experts for opinions but, as electronic devices were also mentioned by Dopamine and Brisc said he'd contacted people during meetings, maybe he'd streamed a conversation for longer than intended and Pando got information he shouldn't have who then shared it with the second person.
---
Pure speculation but, based on what little information we have to put together, it's the chain of events that makes most sense.
---
Well, apart from Brisc being stupid enough to risk his IRL job and reputation for a few more spacebucks or CCP being stupid enough to publicly announce they were banning a high-profile member of the community without any evidence risking embarrassing themselves in front of their brand new owners. If there's one thing people care about more than money it's reputation.
---
GSF actually has a team participating.
---
Free stuff to counteract idiotic balance changes. Smart.
---
It's a historical retrospective. 
---
Important that we document extinct alliances, to teach future generations.
---
I would give credit to Delve instead. Goons created lands that exists beyond any balance, and these circumstances give birth to mindsets like these.
---
That's quite the spaghetti.
---
Brisc also said in TIS that he'd had a disagreement with CSM members before about how he communicated with someone in a meeting so I would imagine it was brought up then and, since then, CCP have been monitoring the situation for evidence.
---
Hey, I’ve got a relatively old Alpha account and got this DLC on Steam (account linked with Eve). I launched EVE, even restarted the game: nothing, not even a redeemable item. Is this normal? Should I just wait?
---
Thanks so much for giving this away! It’ll be nice to demo Omega :)
---
This has to be a troll right?
---
Mintchip as in the YouTube girl that joined CCP?
---
Yes, sadly. It’s quite fun, that’s like punching the orphan with Down syndrome at the daycare since so long that you do it when the big guys aren’t looking, you’re fine.
---
FYI for discord:

it was me

sorry not sorry

It's a replacement for C4 space which will be purged by CCP in the near future
---
Of course. Soter will be by to debrief you on the finer points of posting essays on the Intaki Syndicate on Reddit.

Then you write a app, get a App Store license, and give your work away for free!
---
 I fucking love Neocomm 2, makes it really easy to keep up with my PI, build jobs, and market orders.
---
The little add banner on the bottom will not effect your data or battery.
---
I miss being able to bet on the AT. I'd even put not-spacebucks on it if there was somewhere I could :(
---
&gt; his includes IT infrastructure for alliances that tends to be more secure than real businesses 
---
I disagree, NC IT is absolutely hilariously fucked in so many ways.
---
Have you tried shooting them?
---
I downvoted it cos he's a dumbass.
---
Ty for this
---
It starts okay, can be harder to patch and use alts, but I'm glad it serves your purposes! The download speed is also pretty nice I think.
---
&gt; small task forces to try and handle global threats, form trade ties and collaboration. This aims to empower global workers and stabilize global economies to raise human development and quality of life.
---

---
&gt; When a Republican is in office, it's us vs them. Global aid and trade are removed. We invade countries with a massive military and indiscriminately bom
---
When democrats are in power CIA throw the government out of power creating civil wars and power struggle only then for america to officially interevene with "humanitarian aid". When republicans are in power USA officially declares war against "dictatorship regimes" and bomb the shit out of the legitimate governments while prohibiting real humanitarian aid to come for such places. No difference if you ask me. It's either way "divide and conquer" policy.
---
You know what they say, buy high sell low.
---
Yes running self bots is against the discord EULA, hasn't stopped some eve groups though.
---
Hopefully you can use the 250k free SP to get back to the training you had! Honestly I personally think it comes down to whether you want to do the tuto again lol
---
That would be one of the reasons Polaris stayed independent of all of their infrastructure.
---
Just saying that's potential for IRL legal issues
---
Ayyyyo. I'm a fan of my  web comet personally but I'll have to try the alpha cousin instead!
---
Activating mwd to get to a wrek while your cyno is going XD.
---
Still, great kills!
---
Yup, the EULA changes stopped the discord spying through hijacking user accounts. Polaris was shady as fuck but I was never going to break EULAs.
---
CCPSoon(tm)
---
Same, that's when I stopped also
---
I understand what you’re saying but a super cap umbrella is not a game mechanic. It’s organization by a group of players.
---
After FAX came e-mail, not superfax
---
It didn't stop us spying on discord, I had a workaround for that without breaking the EULA. Just made the process less efficient.
---
They did. In the previous thread about this bug, a CCP dev showed up and clearly stated that the report was filed, received, logged, and work began to fix the bug. They fixed it (well, mostly fixed it, by the look of it) but it didn't make it in time to be shipped with the main content patch, hence the hotfix the next day. If it's still broken in some edge cases, I'd guess it's just another hotfix away from being stamped out completely.
---
If your leaving eve, can I have your stuff?
---
Yeah I thought of workarounds (involving the web client and how websockets work) but never executed on them due to that being really grey area in regards to that EULA change.
---
I will be disapointed if you don't find someone in dreddit and hand them a freighter for you to blow up on the D-P undock.
---
I used accelerators with +5s and biology 5. I could train a skill in 1/3 the time with the advanced versions. However, CCP changed the drop rates and now they are getting as expensive as just buying injectors.
---
Still got JDC 5 out of it real fast.
---
&gt; There’s the Neocom app if you don’t mind ads or paying $10/month for it.
---
https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources
---
This page seems to indicate that charging real money for an EVE application is no bueno.
---
Whole thing is a way to gain trust from the community and wag the dog while making changes that a lot of people are upset about. Eve is all about distraction and deception and you expect the developer to be above that?
---
They are hard to mass produce and the BPCs are hard to mass-source, so they're a ripe target for market game
---
Because of how they're made it can take time for the market to respond
---
I've done this with SAARs, and watched the market bots (err, I mean, dedicated space truckers that mysteriously work 24 hours a day and will 0.01 you every 10 minutes) fill the gaps
---
Usually takes the bots somewhere between 12 and 48 hours to fix an off-market, I'll bet JITA will be fixed by the time the sun comes up tomorrow
---
Haha, nice, Tama is definitely a hotspot for lowsec even these days. It's no Amamake but it's still the local hive of scum and militia :D
---
Arent they adjusting respawn time?
---
just about

CCP should **TEMPORARILY AND FOR A LIMITED TIME DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE DROP RATE OF THE ~~SAAR~~ MASB BPC**

In this case they only nourished the existing one.

I didn't play when C0ven was a thing. Were they that bad?
---
Why are such promotions almost never run on the official site?
---
But the article says they are trying to eliminate B-rated groups and joke teams?

Its linked to the steam account. The steam account has it's own eve account if I'm remembering right
---
People without terminal spodbrain: how bad is application on frigates with the appropriate (presumably he should have been using SSFs??) fighters and like, any application mods at all? I haven't gotten to take my carrier out for a spin and, though I'm sure I'm giving too much credit to the guy that made that post, CCP has in the past swung the nerf bat too hard.

That’s the EVE account I’m using. You can login with other credentials but yeah, it’s linked to my Steam account. If I go to EVE and login with Steam, it works.

I still haven’t received my pack yet though :(

What was the ID id the other side?

The BPC's are from exploration correct?

You can join one of the established mining corps on the outskirts of HS. Do not stay near Jita or major hubs. If you decide to come back I would recommend going to some places and moving around a bit, play a bit in your primary timezone etc. When you find a nice area see who the local corps are and ask if you can join.
---
CODE and plenty of gankers are still around and you will get ganked. But if you do it right it will happen so seldom that your losses simply won't be much.

Halfway through I started to realise you were just chucking in as many Latin terms as you could and that you're not actually Italian :P
---
Training subcaps, never had much desire to fly caps.
---
Well like Falcon said.... 48 hours...
---
Yes. Make a second account and second character. Might as well train that too, its nice to have backup characters. Make one Caldari in or near Jita 4-4 and focus it on trading, jsut fly some basic frigates and basic transports. Can make another dedicated to frigate / destroyer combat for FW PvP because you don't wanna ruin your faction standings and have a hard time traveling through high sec space on your main. They are free so why not ? All you do is log them in once in a while and add to their skill que.
---
This will also let you explore different ships, weapons, systems without having to spread too much and become ineffective skill wise.
---
&gt;In current US legal practice, in rem (the type of styling of the case against an object) is most widely used in the area of asset forfeiture, frequently in relation to controlled substances offenses. In rem forfeiture cases allow property (in this case, $124,700 in cash) to be directly sued by and forfeited to the government, without either just compensation or the possessor (and presumptive owner) being convicted of a crime.

&gt;The defendant currency was seized on May 28, 2003, from one of the claimants, Emiliano Gomez Gonzalez. According to testimony adduced at trial, Gonzalez was driving west on Interstate 80 in a rented Ford Taurus when a Nebraska State Patrol Trooper, Chris Bigsby, stopped Gonzalez for exceeding the posted speed limit. Trooper Bigsby testified that he asked Gonzalez to sit in the front passenger side of his patrol vehicle during the stop. At Bigsby's request, Gonzalez presented a Nevada driver's license and a rental contract for the car, but...

Huh, never knew this could be a thing! Thanks for the info :)

The fucking raptor making the "your fucking dying" sound had me rolling

Absolutely an incredible video
---
Cracked is a joke. It washed alright until the founder cashed out and the site became nothing more than click-bait bullshit.
---
&gt;Why can't the Myrmidon field 5 heavy drones
---
Myrmidon is a battlecruiser with a nice armor rep bonus. A double rep fit gives it very nice tank, if it had 5 heavies to go with that it would be really OP. In addition it also has a fleet support role and can provide buffs for allies or your other characters. With this, it would again become a bit too OP.
---
Though on a personal level I do feel like they should have maybe just scaled down the drone damage bonus and given it 5 heavies, or up the drone damage a bit, not to the levels of current bonus with 5 heavies, jsut somewhere in the middle.
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **3rd Cakeday** thedenv! ^(hug)

rip marshal
---
Well this thread is going to be popular
---
IMHO Tengu. Why ? cause you can refit it a bit and do much better in other content then a Proteus. Tengu DPS is better then drone proteus, it uses far less cap etc. making it easier to fit. Its just an overall more flexible ship.
---
Maybe you could rent it from them while they wait to ransom it back to it’s original owners. If they’re not mining it, their leaving money on the table
---
Dang man. Good on ya for taking it like a champ! :)  hope the rorqs paid for themselves before they went kaboom lol

Damn, your FC is running a muninn fleet without scimi backup? Sounds like a terrible idea :@

Polaris is just a conspiracy theory to deflect from the fact that Sphere is real, and is currently at version 6.3.

Don't be fooled by this fake news

Interesting. Suppose many an API key was neglected rather than deleted over the years.

I've often wondered the same about those gonorrhoea ridden koala bears, because this is is a koalaity shitpost

Fun fact, they do fecal smear transfusions so I guess it would really be a shitpost!

API keys were a useful source of information until they stopped being a thing. ESI gave us a lot better Intel but of course we only got that from willing spies.

How do I add the starter pack to a non-steam account?

If you started after 2005/6 you were too late
---
I'm absolutely shocked I tell you, shocked!
---
FYI, I live in nullsec. I was Just trying to distinguish the difference between some players in null. I'm absolutely not risk-averse. I rat in a hel or nid all the time. Have fielded multiple rorqs at once on the chance that the neuts in Intel had other plans. While I might have red cycled the Indy Core until I figured out where they were going, it didnt stop me from mining. One of my rorqs is fit to deal with small gang groups. And a fax pilot on stand by. Go big or go home :) 
---
And. On the chance that something gets tackled close by, I'm usually one of the first people there scouting, or forming with the rest of the alliance.

I'll give you å drink for that realisation, but somehow i can't imagine ur old enough;)

I'm fairly sure you've had one or two too many if you're agreeing with official forum turbokrabs

High sec is the same way, hell hi sec is better isk vs reward then low. Upwell stations were a good idea, but the execution made the content broken.

Well I upvoted you. I'm pretty sure we would have won the battle either way, but keeping their whole super fleet trapped for a week was worth more than a few extra titan kills.

This is bullshit. Fuck snitches.

Norwegian is a germanic language and is thus related to most other western germanic languages.

Most modern english is developed from the Engli (or Angli) and the Saxons, with large influence from Latin-based languages thanks to the Holy Roman Empire as well as French and indeed some middle-eastern influences as well.
---
Welcome back.
---
Things have changed a bit and there are several large groups that are welcoming to new and returning players. 
---
I suggest you join one of these groups and see what the current game is like and get your feet wet.  Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet/Ascendance(sp?), Brand NewBros, and Brave Newbies are a few of the groups you might consider.
---
All have good people in them that will be happy to help get you on track.
---
I'm with Brave, but have friends everywhere and know everyone is looking for good folks.
---
That's awesome. I'm glad you worked through the assholes, stuck with it, and went on to do big stuff.

Relatively recent, but I was in charge of triage for L4X. First time ever using my fax in something other than a suicide save. Managed to catch all ships on grid, save for other faxes.

Nice NASA image my dude.

I don't have that kind of luxury since i don't have a load of alts. So i have to choose between sitting on undock in a combat ship ready to defend or krabbing because by the time i'm home and reshipped the hostiles are usually gone :(
---
I really love all the "CCP has no proof" crap.  
---
They're not telling the public the details for two reasons.
---
1. It's protected NDA information, it would defeat the purpose of an NDA. They said what it was he did without being specific about the data, this is not a crazy thing to do, it's actually standard practice for any sort of incident involving the NDA, that's why the NDA exists in the first place!
---
2. CCP is under no obligation to explain bans, this is even in the TOS. The end
---
Further to the point, in a game like this there are literally gigabytes of logging information available to the staff. The main reason is so they can find issues, fix bugs, make improvements, and more; the other reason is to have logs of all user interactions in case there are problems with behavior, TOS violations, requests for refunds, reporting of issues, or people being unscrupulous.  
---
To even assume that CCP only has "their word" and not a trove of digital information related to this incident is an incredible naive and rather dimwitted thought. You really think there's no proof?
---
op is budget stainguy

None of the nerfs has anything to do about his drama, im just pointing at op's commentors, hunting for "lols" "salt"

Welcome back to EVE! A lot has changed in the past couple of years, but like you, I am new to a lot of the changes too! My corporation, Dreddit, is always looking for new members, we even have a website that says it:  [http://dredditisrecruiting.com/](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/) . We're a super fun nullsec corp and are the original founding corporation of Test Alliance Please Ignore, which is one of the biggest alliances (and part of one of the biggest coalitions) in the game!
---
Right now we're at war with a bunch of other alliances, so there's always content going on. We do plenty of roams in every timezone and if you don't like doing  those, you can always sit back and farm some ISK mining, exploring, or ratting in our space. Nullsec (0.0 and to -1.0 space) offers some of the best ways to make money in the game and there's no silly CONCORD to blap you when you attack someone.
---
As for what you like to do, we have a ton of people who like to rat in our space. Generally you get around 12-16m per tick with average skills in a Vexor Navy Issue. We also have a lot of people who like to carrier rat, which is great for salvaging their wrecks behind them, since they can finish sites just as fast (or faster) than you can salvage them (they also leave a MTU so it's super easy... just warp in, salvage, and warp again when you're done!). Exploration is quite competitive down here because it's Sansha space, which has the best loot from any relic or data sites.

Dude get off the soapbox before you fall.
---
There are several issues with this rather obtuse narrative you and others keep spouting in this thread.  
---
First and foremost it's not a criminal case in the US, so this whole "innocent til proven guilty" nonsense is just that, nonsense.  
---
This is a video game's TOS violation issue and nothing more. There's no jury, no judge, and no constitutional amendments protecting this player.
---
Secondly and almost as importantly, this is an MMO. To even for a second believe there aren't really clear logs of his actions is just plain dumb
---
Not these days...
---
I mean there's nothing that says salt like a forum post bitching about how your capital ship doesn't get to be a 100% guaranteed risk-free frigate hunter
---
or just enforce 2fa on discord and that shit won't work
---
He never stated to be a hunter, thats my job;)

i see interesting might give it a bash.
---
Man for once I agree with Doom. Lmao
---
Depends. Some are timed or event based where the info learned becomes irrelevent after a specific date. Each NDA is different and each jurisdiction may vary on what's enforceable.

This is why you need an actual lawyer and not a shitposter on the internet's opinion.
